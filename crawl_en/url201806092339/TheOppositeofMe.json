The secondary characters were well written and added dimension and texture to the story. The writing is exceptional and I was swept away from the very first page. My only disappointment was in the ending. It was so abrupt, that I found myself reading the acknowledgments thinking I was still in the story. I did a double take and went back and forth before I realized I was finished. Unfortunately, the ending didn't stand up to the rest of the book so my rating went from a solid 5 stars to 3 stars, for average. A shame given this was one of the better books I have read in a long while. I would like to try something else from this author, but worried about another abrupt ending that leaves me feeling cheated."}, {"userName": "Charlotte", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/650832-charlotte", "userReview": "http://charlotteswebofbooks.blogspot....Sibling rivalry can be a great motivator for us to strive for success, but it can also be an ugly, ugly thing. In The Opposite of Me, Lindsey is so consumed by her desire to differentiate herself from her twin sister, Alex, that she can't see what it has done to the most precious relationship a woman can have. A relationship with her sister. It was painfully embarrassing to read Lindsey's jealousy on paper. She had everything going for her, but her desire to be better than Alex nearly destroyed her. Once she arrives at home and starts sorting things out and seeing Alex for who she really is, well that is when I really started enjoying the book. Seeing the both of them change and grow closer was truly wonderful. Making The Opposite of Me the perfect book for sisters, friends, and book clubs all over the world."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8887111-denise", "userReview": "The Opposite of Me is more than a chick lit book.

When I first started reading it, I immediately got that chick lit feeling in my stomach. You know, when the book you are about to read will consist of mainly fluff. However, while I do classify this as a chick lit, it's a slight cut above most of the other books I've read. The main character is a workaholic who has to leave the life she knows and move back home with her \"perfect' twin sister. The first half of the book goes on to talk about how perfect the sister is. And while the main character clearly has disdain for her, we, the reader wonder what's wrong with her, besides being pretty. She's not a mean person or a bitch. So I didn't really get the rivalry other than jealousy. The second half of the book picks up a touch, and when I stopped reading last night, I was curious to see how the story ended. However, I wasn't' thrilled with the ending. All in all, a pleasant BEACH or vacation read but a forgettable one!"}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7278451-maria", "userReview": "N\u00e3o foi um livro que me tivesse prendido muito.

I was lucky enough to get an advance copy of it and I read it in just a few days. The story is about fraternal twin sisters, Lindsey and Alex. The story is told from Lindsey's point of view and in the first person (which I really like!).Lindsey is a single woman working at an ad agency in NYC. She's hoping to get promoted to the open VP position when things go horribly and unexpectedly wrong. It's here that she needs to make a decision - go home to Maryland and start anew or hang tough in NYC. She decides to go home to Maryland. At the same time of adjusting to her new life, Lindsey has to deal with her successful twin sister and their complex relationship.Besides the laugh-out-loud humor, what I liked most about this book is that it was uncompletely unpredicable. It held me right to the very end. A lot of chick lit books have predictable plots so there isn't any fun reading them, but this book is definitely different.I also enjoyed meeting Lindsey's family and sharing in the dynamics between them. I could see myself and my family - and our preconceived notions - in the book. Really enjoyable read - you won't be disappointed!"}, {"userName": "Carla Geraldes", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21693847-carla-geraldes", "userReview": "Um romance levezinho que se l\u00ea rapidamente."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3399699-rose", "userReview": "You guys know I can't resist books about twins, and given that it was $1.99 on Google Play, I got it.

She'll be the youngest vice president that her company has ever had, and she will have everything that she's ever wanted in life. One devastating night takes it all out of her grasp, and she heads home to Maryland with her tail between her legs.Lindsey has always been labelled \"the smart one\", while her sister has been labelled \"the pretty one\", so Lindsey decides not to tell her parents that she has lost her job and everything that she has worked so hard for, and instead decides to keep up the charade that she is scouting out a new location for her former employer.As if living with her parents and being unemployed isn't bad enough, Lindsey is forced to become involved with Alex's wedding plans to Prince Charming. Watching her sister, who has always had everything handed to her on a silver platter, preparing to walk down the aisle nearly breaks her resolve to re-invent herself. However, when an old family secret is revealed, and when Alex faces some unexpected challenges, Lindsey and Alex discover that things are not always what they seem to be and they both come to see themselves and their role in their family in an entirely new way. I love \"The Opposite of Me\"'s gorgeous cover. I mean, I'm not one to generally judge a book by its cover and all that, but it certainly helps when the cover is as appealing as this one! The picture on the cover is of the back of the heads of two women, one a brunette and one a redhead, and when we learn that Lindsey is a brunette and Alex is a redhead, it made sense. I love that it doesn't show their faces, I like being able to imagine that for myself.Beyond the obvious cover appeal, the story itself flows effortlessly. This is at first glance a larger book (400 pages), but the story is so enticing that I couldn't put it down. I didn't find the dialogue awkward like I have in some debut books- awkward writing is one of my biggest pet peeves and usually detracts from my overall enjoyment of any book. Instead, I found a carefully plotted story with words that flowed, and it easily held my attention.The characters in this book were especially well-developed. The emphasis is on Lindsey, and the story is from her point of view, but we do get strong glimpses into Alex's mindset. Lindsey and Alex's parents were hilarious, and they provided comic relief at the more serious parts, which helped the book to maintain its overall lighthearted tone.The ending was predictable, but that made it no less satisfying for me. In fact, one of the things that makes me sigh wistfully at the end of the book is how good the ending was. After I was done reading The Opposite of Me, you can rest assured that there was lots of wistful sighing.Sarah Pekkanen has written a strong debut novel, and I'm thrilled that this will not be the last we hear from her (she's already submitted the manuscript for her next book). \"The Opposite of Me\" is a compelling look at the complicated bond between sisters."}, {"userName": "Alisha Marie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1585205-alisha-marie", "userReview": "Okay, so I've got a crapload of sisters. I have two older sisters and two younger sisters (although the youngest sister is 16 years younger than me and only six so she really doesn't fit into the competitive mold), so I understood the relationship between Lindsey and Alex perfectly. While my sisters and I have all gotten over the whole competitiveness a few years ago, I still remember when it was rampant during our teenage years and it was FIERCE! So, again, I identified with Lindsey on that and that was why originally I intended to give this book five stars. But then, it turned for me.I liked The Opposite of Me for the most part, but in the beginning I thought that it was wonderful. I loved it and couldn't wait to get back to it when I put it down. I just loved Lindsey and was so curious about her relationship with Alex. But then the sob story happened. I'm sorry, but does EVERYTHING have to have a sob story?! Don't get me wrong, I don't want the very few chick-lits I read to be all fluffy and airless, it's just that that particular sob story has been done to death. I would've preferred a different sob story, one that doesn't happen in every other women's fiction/chick-lit book. And another thing: that HUGE family secret? A bit on the disappointing side and just made Alex seem more like a Mary Sue. And I don't like Mary Sue characters. At all. Also, I didn't buy that crap that Alex said (very mild spoiler here) about not knowing that Lindsey was jealous of her. No one is that oblivious.Now that I got that off my chest, I have to say that I did like some of the other aspects of The Opposite of Me. I loved the whole dating service storyline. I thought that it was actually a good way to have a dating service. I also adored Lindsey's parents. They were just so cute and hilarious. Speaking of hilarious, Matt was also great. Such a sweet and great friend. Basically, all of the supporting characters in this book were good. Plus, this book was a major (and I do mean MAJOR cause even when I was bitchin about it, I couldn't put it down) page-turner. I basically read it in one day in breaks between my classes.So, regardless of my little rant above, I did like The Opposite of Me. I thought it was pretty funny and pretty sweet if a bit predictable. However, I would've liked it more if it had been sans big sob story and a little more about the sisters dealing with their issues without that major thing prompting it."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93254-michelle", "userReview": "This book employs many hallmarks of chick lit: working gal in the big city too busy for love, a best friend/sister who is perfect (or is she?), a love interest who likes said best friend/sister, and a massive career change. There's nothing revolutionary here but it's a sweet, fast read. The writing is very conversational and \"cute,\" which I think some people would adore (I did like it) and others might not. It was pretty predictable in the way that chick lit can be (you know the ending, but you're still glad it ended that way!) and the \"big family secret\" was not as shocking as expected. Still, it was a fast and quick read and I would definitely recommend as a beach book. As a sister, and a mom of sisters, the sibling angle was very interesting to me. Although my sister and I do not have a contentious/competitive relationship like the sisters in this book, that piece of it felt very authentic. I also really liked how the author pointed out how much siblings can define a person. I think about that all the time, how different my oldest would be if she didn't have her little sister on the scene (and how much she changed once she was in the picture) and vice versa.

Determined to get noticed, Lindsey is finally on the cusp of being named VP creative director of an elite New York advertising agency, after years of eighty-plus-hour weeks, migraines, and profound loneliness. But during the course of one devastating night, Lindsey\u2019s carefully constructed life implodes. Humiliated, she flees the glitter of Manhattan and retreats to the time warp of her parents\u2019 Maryland home. As her sister plans her lavish wedding to her Prince Charming, Lindsey struggles to maintain her identity as the smart, responsible twin while she furtively tries to piece her career back together. But things get more complicated when a long-held family secret is unleashed that forces both sisters to reconsider who they are and who they are meant to be.First of all, I have to say that this book starts off very slowly. So much so that I almost gave up. But OMG...I am SO glad that I didn't because I really would have missed out on a really good book. I have to say that I am really shocked to find myself giving a book that started out the way it did 5 stars! The novel really picked up at about page 150 in the trade paperback edition. Then it took off and flew! I am excusing her slow start to the fact that this is her debut novel, but if this is the only problem then I simply cannot wait to read more of her writing as it matures.I thought that the relationship between Lindsay and Alex very real. When you have two daughters, especially fraternal twins, there is most definitely going to be comparisons and jealousy especially when one, Alex, is obviously much more beautiful than the other. Of course Lindsay is going to feel ignored and almost invisible behind the shine of not only Alex's looks but magnetic personality. This is just real relationship stuff between sisters and anyone who has sisters, and it doesn't have to be a twin, has felt jealousy at some point of the other. And it definitely goes both ways. As Lindsay finds out throughout her transformation in the book and her renewed relationship with Alex, Lindsay realizes that Alex was jealous of Lindsay's academic abilities. Alex wished she lived an independent life in New York with a high powered job in a big time ad agency, but Lindsay was so wrapped up in her own feelings to ever realize that Alex may have some of the same feelings toward her. Alex and Lindsay were so real and fully developed that I felt like they could be members of my own family. I understood exactly what they were feeling and the problems that were keeping them apart. It's was just a shame that it took such a major event to get the sisters talking again and re-inventing their relationship.One another note, I absolutely loved Alex and Lindsay's parents. They provided great comic relief during some tough times during the book. They were portrayed perfectly as an long happily married couple who bickered and fought hilariously throughout the book! They were great!The major event that got the girls talking again was a mind blower. I can't say much more because I don't want to spoil the book but it was written with such love and bittersweetness. This was when the sisters truly started to re-connect. It felt so real and it truly touched my heart.I can't say enough about this book! It was fantastic! I had my doubts at the beginning but the author redeemed herself with an excellent comeback with a wonderful story and beautiful writing with characters that were true and real. I highly recommend this book! Just stick with it if you are having trouble at the beginning. Trust me...it gets so much better. 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Liz Fenton", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2079101-liz-fenton", "userReview": "I Loved this book!

But things get more complicated when a long-held family secret is unleashed that forces both sisters to reconsider who they are and who they are meant to be.Sarah Pekkanen\u2019s debut novel came to my attention when Sarah emailed us in 2009 about signing her book deal. It sounded like a wonderful novel and I was thrilled when in 2010 Sarah sent me a signed copy of her novel to read. It\u2019s taken me absolutely ages to finally find the time to pick it up \u2013 partly due to how busy I\u2019ve been with other novels but partly because I didn\u2019t want to be disappointed by the novel. I eventually took the plunge though, and I must admit, I was very impressed with the novel. Obviously when it comes to Chick Lit there are many labels that fly around and Sarah\u2019s novel is definitely more Women\u2019s Fiction than Chick Lit. But then again, these days it\u2019s all the same, we just need to find an umbrella to cover it all (\u2019cause Chick Lit apparently isn\u2019t sufficient)!There are lots of novels around featuring twins. Well, three, that I can think of (this one, Getting Away With It by Julie Cohen and Sweet Valley Confidential). I must admit I\u2019ve always wanted to be a twin. It\u2019s a long sought after dream of mine to have someone exactly like me, to think like me, to have by my side at all times, to trust implicitly, but, er, it\u2019s not going to happen since I\u2019m almsot 21. Unless of course my parents sent my twin out to be adopted, but then again, I\u2019m not in an American TV show so the odds are slim. So obviously for the twin-less me, the next best thing is novels about twins. Not that they extol the virtues of twinhood. In fact, they make it sound downright annoying and not the fabulousness I always imagined it would be. The Opposite of Me is no different, in that despite being twins Lindsey and Alex are like chalk and cheese. Alex is the pretty twin, Lindsey is the smart twin. They don\u2019t get on, they have no twinship, and Lindsey always feels like the lesser twin.The Opposite of me starts brilliantly, introducing us to Lindsey who is super busy at the ad-firm she works at. She\u2019s a shoo-in for VP, until one catastrophic night changes that and she find herself back at home in Maryland, lying to her family and friends about losing her job. The most interesting part of the novel for me \u2013 apart from the obvious feud between Lindsey and Alex \u2013 was the friendship Lindsey has with a lady she helps when she\u2019s out shopping, May. I can understand why Lindsey was reluctant to tell her family about losing her job and her subsequent new job with May. The book wasn\u2019t what I expected, I did expect it to revolve around Lindsey and Alex but it wasn\u2019t. It obviously was a major part of the novel, but the book was about Lindsey becoming her own person, not letting the shadow of Alex ruin her life for good.I found Lindsey to be a very interesting and complex character. There\u2019s a lot to her, despite her workaholic tendencies. I can understand completely why she felt the need to work so hard \u2013 after all, when you perceive yourself as the ugly twin, you need to feel as if you\u2019re good at something, right? There\u2019s a lot of deep-seated resentment buried deep, but despote all of her issues and bitterness (it has to be said), I was really taken in by her. I thought Lindsey really came into her own during the second half of the novel as a big twist was unleashed. I did think her crush on Bradley was stupid, but again, I understood why she thought she liked him so much, mainly to get one-up on Alex, despite the fact Alex was engaged. I expected to hate Alex, and for a lot of the novel I did. Because from Lindsey\u2019s point of view, she does come across as a bit of a spoiled brat. But Alex is faced with something huge about three-quarters of the way through the novel and I saw her in a new light. I definitely feel like I misjudged her. One of the stand-out characters for me was Matt, Lindsey\u2019s friend in New York. He doesn\u2019t feature much \u2013 sadly \u2013 but he\u2019s always there and I\u2019d have loved to have seen more of him.Like I\u2019ve said, there\u2019s a fairly large twist in the last quarter of the book, it stunned me in fact. It was a real heart-stopper, and it came totally out of left field. It threw me for a loop but it didn\u2019t entirely make me incredibly sad like it should have. I can\u2019t explain why not. It was shocking, it was sad, it had all the right ingredients but for some reason that I can\u2019t pinpoint, I just didn\u2019t feel as if I\u2019d been punched in the gut. But it definitely opened my eyes and it definitely changed some relationships in the novel. The Opposite of Me was a wonderful read. From start to finish I was hooked, and I\u2019m so pleased I finally gave in and read the novel, it didn\u2019t disappoint me at all. Sarah is a wonderful new voice in Chick Lit and I\u2019m really looking forward to getting my hands on Skipping a Beat, her second novel, it\u2019s one I\u2019ll be purchasing in the near future!"}, {"userName": "Kayla Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/157272-kayla-anderson", "userReview": "I'm becoming a big fan of Sarah Pekkanen.

She works at a NYC advertising agency, where she is highly successful. Competing with the office whore for the biggest account and a huge promotion, Lindsey feels on top of the world. When she loses the account AND the promotion, she makes a huge drunken mistake by making out with one of her colleagues and gets fired.She moves back home to Maryland, where she\u2019s told her entire family that she\u2019s in charge of opening a DC branch of the advertising agency.Lindsey dreads seeing her sister Alex. Alex is perfect. She\u2019s gorgeous and always has been. She models and appears on TV regularly. All Lindsey\u2019s life, she worked hard to be the smart one to set herself apart from her twin sister Alex.Lindsey falls into a nice little routine at home. She takes up shopping as a hobby, enjoys the feeling of looking beautiful, something she always yearned for when Alex was gaining attention from every one around them. She meets a new friend who introduces her to a career as a matchmaker. Everything seems to be going great\u2026until there is an accident.Faced with a crisis, Lindsey must put her jealousy and feelings for her sister behind in order to be there for her.I really enjoyed this book. I started reading it on my flight to Chicago and before I knew it I was 100 pages in.I could relate to Lindsey. Lindsey worked in advertising. I work in PR. I could understand the need for Lindsey to be a workaholic (though I am no where near as crazy as she is!) but I understood her field and the pressure she was under. I enjoyed learning about the campaign Lindsey was working on and reading about the workplace competitiveness. I anxiously flipped pages waiting to see if Lindsey would win the coveted promotion she so deserved.I loved the story being told from Lindsey\u2019s point of view. There was a lot of internal discussion that I enjoyed reading and could relate to based on my relationship with my own sister. The core discussion that I loved about this book was the idea that from an early age, we are stereotyped within our families: the smart one, the pretty one, the athletic one, etc. This book discusses whether we can escape the \u201croles\u201d we are given from the time we are born. Do you think it\u2019s possible?My only problem with the book was the ending. While I felt like things were wrapping up neatly into a happy ending, the book ended before we fully got to that point. This leads me to wondering if there will be a sequel. Things seemed to end abruptly and there is so much more to explore. However, things did seem to end neatly enough that a sequel doesn\u2019t seem guaranteed.I was initially drawn to this book because I\u2019d heard that the writing style was similar to Jennifer Weiner (my all time favorite author!) and Emily Giffin. I would definitely agree that the ideas and inward dialogue reminded me of these two other authors, so if you like them, give this one a try!"}, {"userName": "Lydia Laceby", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3322071-lydia-laceby", "userReview": "Originally Reviewed at Novel EscapesI liked The Opposite of Me, but I\u2019m afraid I didn\u2019t love it as much as I wanted to. There are rave reviews for this debut, but unfortunately I was disappointed. Pekkanen\u2019s writing has been compared to Jennifer Weiner and Emily Giffin, and while I could see that, it fell flat with me for several reasons. I don\u2019t know if it was because of all the hype surrounding this release, but it definitely didn\u2019t blow me away as much as Jennifer Weiner\u2019s Good In Bed, but then again, not much could live up to one of my favourite chick lit novels.I really enjoyed Pekkanen\u2019s voice. It was fresh and felt like a friend was telling me a story which made the novel easy and fun to read. The first part of this chick lit tale, set in New York City, flew by and I felt the frantic life Lindsay led with her long hours and pressure to advance her career. When she moved home, I immediately felt the change of pace and thought this was very well done by Pekkanen because it was such a dramatic change. The beginning of this novel had me hooked, but it was once she left for home that things started unravelling for me. I became annoyed at Lindsay\u2019s jealousy of her sister and at times didn\u2019t understand it, maybe because we weren\u2019t shown any actual interactions with Alex for such a long time so I couldn\u2019t see firsthand why she felt this way. I don\u2019t have any sisters, so was left wondering if that\u2019s why I couldn\u2019t relate, but Kathryn does and she felt similarly. And to be fair, I actually didn\u2019t relate much to Weiner\u2019s In Her Shoes either, so maybe novels about sisters don\u2019t engage me much. This chick lit tale wasn\u2019t as predictable as I feared it might be part way through, which was nice, and I enjoyed several of the other characters, but found they were lost in the shuffle. First her parents, who I thought were charming and funny, but I wanted more from them, especially towards the end of the story when a family secret was revealed. I also really liked the friend she made along the way who also seemed to disappear from the story without a trace as well as some of her new clients. The focus shifted towards her sister, which was to be expected with the storyline, but I missed seeing these characters and I found the ending abrupt as it all wrapped up too neatly and quickly.The Opposite of Me explores themes of sibling rivalry, expectations and assumptions of oneself as well as family and I questioned my own family history and relationships with my brothers.Although I felt something missing with this novel, or whether I missed something myself, I\u2019ll definitely read another novel by Pekkanen."}, {"userName": "Shonda", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1655614-shonda", "userReview": "4.5 StarsLindsey Rose is at the top of her game. At 29, she\u2019s on the path to become the youngest VP Creative Director at her advertising firm. All she has to do is nail this top ad campaign and it\u2019s pretty much in the bag. Lindsey is convinced she has nothing to worry about. That is until an announcement blindsides her and sends her crashing on a path she never thought she would find herself on.With her career and future in shambles, Lindsey decides to leave Manhattan and return home to Maryland to live with her parents while she tries to figure out her next step. There\u2019s just one small problem: her parents aren\u2019t aware of the REAL reason she came home. She can\u2019t tell them, she thinks, as she doesn\u2019t want to disappoint them. You see, Lindsey has a twin sister Alex. Alex is the beautiful, outgoing sister and Lindsey has lived (not so comfortably) in Alex\u2019s shadow as the smart sister. Lindsey has lost her New York City apartment and status of her job, so keeping her \u201csmart label\u201d is all she has right now.The Opposite of Me is a story about Lindsey and Alex told through Lindsey\u2019s eyes. The reader is privileged to learn about their relationship through flashbacks and current events. Pekkanen does an amazing job with describing Alex from Lindsey\u2019s perspective, leaving the reader to form his/her own opinion about Alex. I have to admit, never once did I dislike Alex. I thought there would be more to her than what Lindsey thought she knew and I was happy to learn there was.Both sisters have lived their lives by a label that was placed on them. As adult women, both have allowed these labels (either subconsciously or consciously) to shape their lives. When the sisters share a life-altering event, they are finally able to rewrite the script for their lives.What I liked best about The Opposite of Me was I felt I was being told a story instead of reading a story. I easily pictured myself as one of Lindsey\u2019s high school friends and we bumped into each other on M Street in Georgetown. We grab lunch and catch up. Lindsey then proceeds to tell me about New York and why she\u2019s now back home. Early in the novel, I was lost in the story as the hours slipped by. I think fans of Emily Giffin will love Pekkanen\u2019s debut novel.Ms. Pekkanen is currently working on her second book. I do hope she brings back these characters in the future. Without spoiling the ending, I want to know what\u2019s next for them!

Not the typical \"jealous sister\" story readers might be expecting.I really wish Lindsey had just quit on the spot after the whole promotion fiasco. I don't think the snafu with her coworker was necessary or fit with the rest of the storyline. At best, the guy could have at least fessed up to his other office conquests and pointed out he had a history of such, to save a bit of face. I had a feeling about Matt......but I'm also sorry things went the way they did with Bradley... This story has a lot of \"nature vs. nurture\" in its argument. Did the \"pretty one\" skate on her looks, instead of applying herself, even though the aptitude tests showed how smart she really was? Did the \"smart one\" work harder at it because she believed she wasn't pretty? Did everyone just cop to the roles that the rest of society pressed them into? Who might they have become, if they'd been left alone? I find it ironic (and annoying) that even Alex kept steeling Alex's own thunder. First the \"pretty one\" and her engagement and pending nuptials detract from the \"smart one\" and her job issues. Then the \"pretty one\" manages to not only end the engagement, have a car accident to distract everyone from that, then get diagnosed with bad news, and one thing just continues to trump the other. She doesn't do it on purpose, but, in addition to constantly stealing her sister's thunder, one thing after another keeps stealing her own spotlight at the same time! I kind of wish the book had been more fun and lighthearted, and less dramatic and introspective, but it was still a really good read and I liked that Lindsey finally got herself figured out, at least... and Alex has started to.But I still don't think she should have gotten Bradley."}, {"userName": "Meg - A Bookish Affair", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132408-meg---a-bookish-affair", "userReview": "3.5 stars. \"The Opposite of Me\" was my first Sarah Pekkanen book. I was happy that I finally got to read something by her and I know that I will definitely be reading more by here in the future. I love stories about family ties and I especially like stories about sisters. Pekkanen tells the story of two sisters who are fraternal twins although they are not especially close. The star of this book really is the writing. The story is good but it is really Pekkanen's writing that brings the story and its characters to life. She writes really believable characters. The narrator of the story is Lindsey, one of the sisters, and she felt really real to me. You feel like she is almost talking to you, the reader, as a friend, which really pulled me into the story.I also really liked that this book took place in Maryland and in the D.C. Metro area, which I am very familiar with. It was really cool to see places that I am so familiar with in this book. I thought the author did a really good job of capturing what this area was like. I love when I can find books set in this area that aren't political thrillers (believe me, it is difficult to do)!Some parts of the book were a little disjointed. The end seemed very, very rushed. I almost wished that the big turn in the story (I don't want to give anything away) came earlier in the book so that things could be a little more resolved by the end of the book. Overall, this story was still very enjoyable to me.Bottom line: I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a really realistic voice in a story about the familial ties that bind us."}, {"userName": "Whitney Teal", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1270760-whitney-teal", "userReview": "\"Lindsey Rose\u2019s life is perfectly in order when The Opposite of Me opens: She\u2019s hours away from being made one of the vice-presidents at a large advertising firm, weeks away from owning a piece real estate in a tony New York neighborhood, she\u2019s got a closet full of designer clothes, oh, and she\u2019s only 29 years old.

Sarah Pekkanen\u2019s debut novel may sound like the beginning of a familiar chick lit story, but over the course of nearly 400 pages wades into deeper waters.Though the book is billed as a book about sisters (and it is, in a way), the central theme seems to be identity. Even the four markers that divide the book, \u201cSuccess,\u201d \u201cHome,\u201d \u201cJump,\u201d and \u201cTrading Places,\u201d suggest a stage in Lindsey\u2019s changing identity, which the heroine is comfortable with at the beginning as the successful, smart, and serious twin to Alexandra, who\u2019s beautiful, breathtaking, even, charming and popular.

Lindsey and Alex are fraternal twins with nothing in common except having shared a uterus for nine months. Lindsey is a successful marketing exec in New York, while Alex is a model and TV personality in the DC area.

When everything goes terribly wrong at work, Lindsey is forced to make changes she never imagined would happen. She moves back home to Bethesda and starts her life over, expecting to resume her high powered successul life in DC but life happens and her goals change. There are some surprising twists and turns in this story. I never had a sister so it was interesting to see these women bond over time. I don't know what that's like, but apparently they hadn't either until circumstances drove them together. Some aspects were strange, like Alex dating the guy who had always loved Lindsey - I'm just not sure that's realistic because ladies are territorial and also I think there is some level of disrespect there, but that's just me.
