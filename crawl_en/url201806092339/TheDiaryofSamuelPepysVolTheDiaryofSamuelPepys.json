However, music and women I cannot but give way to, whatever my business is.\" - Samuel Pepys, Diary, 9 March 1966In the seventh volume (1666, with 151,000 words), Pepys, having survived and reported on the  Great Plague of 1665, shows his luck and resilience by also surviving the  Great Fire of London in 1666. Ironically, the biggest struggle facing England was not the Plague or the Fire, but the sad, vicious, and negligent Court. The dysfunction of government in England makes Pepys and others afraid that within a year they could see the ruin of the Kingdom. Pepys' own fortunes, however, continue to grow, as does his aggressive groping of women (\u00e7a change, plus c'est la m\u00eame chose).

The main part I read in 1666\u2019s diary is about the great fire in London, how Pepys described it all. It\u2019s an interesting thing, since his tone for diary is definitely different from our ages. \u201cDear Diary\u2026\u201d No, his diary is more like a list, how everything happened. A special note about this 1666 diary is that he didn\u2019t really mentioned how the fire affected the people, rather he wrote the dove flew away from the fire in detail. However, personally, I think it somehow emphasis how terrible the fire is. From the movement of a tiny animal, how they left in a rush. That I think is a funny part of Samuel Pepys diary. He was not like other authors who purposely left his diary to be seen, but he wrote them down with his original idea about them."}, {"userName": "Judith Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22803003-judith-johnson", "userReview": "Only a few more volumes to go! What will I do when there's no more Sam to remind me that even 350 years ago there was still crap going on in the world of politics!!! And that our aches and pains still and always will loom larger sometimes in our thoughts, or who we're going to ask over for a slap-up dinner! I know he had his character-defects, but I'm fond of him... Once I'm done I guess I'll have to move on to Richard Burton's diary!"}, {"userName": "Ria", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/921981-ria", "userReview": "The most turbulent year in the series of diaries so far, war is breaking out with France declaring war and disastrous Dutch sea battles with the English.Add to that the state of the navy coffers is well nigh depleted and there is no more money to send ships out to sea in the coming year and still some uncertainty as to the spread of the plague.Also the biggest and most harrowing event of this year is the Great fire of London, over 13,000 homes are destroyed and London is so decimated that only a fifth is left standing. The eye witness accounts by Pepys is like a glimpse into history with its immediacy, you are transported back in time and are virtually walking the streets with him as he describes the fear of the people and animals trying to avoid the blaze.A theory is put forward that this is a plot by the French to take Britain, this is a very bold statement and i do not know how much truth there is to that or if this is just Pepys and other people wildly theorising to try and make sense of the disaster.Strangely enough maybe due to the stresses with his naval work and the state of the country in general and the great fire he seems to be slipping back to his old habits of the earlier diaries with a lot more romantic encounters, sometimes more than one in a single diary entry and also his play going is increasing though he is aware of this and self imposes fines and punishments due to his weakness for the theatre and feels shame in case anyone sees him and recognises him.All in all a big year for Pepys and also historically as there is such a sense of unrest at this moment in time."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5886434-lisa", "userReview": "The year starts with the plague still around although less than 1665 and hopes that the cold will stop it. As we proceed through the year the war with the Dutch escalates with two major sea battles in the summer that are disasters for England. There is much talk about the ineptitude of the leaders and the fact that the men are disgruntled as they aren't being paid. Then disaster strikes as most of London burns in September. This is an excellent section of the diary as Pepys first hand account describes in detail the terror of this time. Pepys meanwhile continues his womanizing ways and I keep wondering two things, if his wife is doing the same with married men and what these women think. Unfortunately sexual assault clearly wasn't a thing then, but I can't imagine getting groped was that much fun for these women. The year ends with a dismal feel about the war, the troops, the city's very slow rebuild and Pepys' accounts being lower (he's a little obsessed)."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "From BBC Radio 4 - 15 Minute Drama:Hattie Naylor's dramatisation of the 17th-century diaries.

A really great glimpse of the 17th century!"}], "description": "Samuel Pepys is as much a paragon of literature as Chaucer and Shakespeare. His Diary is one of the principal sources for many aspects of the history of its period. In spite of its significance, all previous editions were inadequately edited and suffered from a number of omissions\u2014until Robert Latham and William Matthews went back to the 300-year-old original manuscript and deciphered each passage and phrase, no matter how obscure or indiscreet.The Diary deals with some of the most dramatic events in English history. Pepys witnessed the London Fire, the Great Plague, the Restoration of Charles II, and the Dutch Wars. He was a patron of the arts, having himself composed many delightful songs and participated in the artistic life of London. His flair for gossip and detail reveals a portrait of the times that rivals the most swashbuckling and romantic historical novels. In none of the earlier versions was there a reliable, full text, with commentary and notation with any claim to completeness. This edition, first published in 1970, is the first in which the entire diary is printed with systematic comment. This is the only complete edition available; it is as close to Pepys\u2019s original as possible.", "title": "The Diary of Samuel Pepys, Vol. 7: 1666\n      \n          (The Diary of Samuel Pepys #7)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/892219.The_Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys_Vol_7", "average": 4.36, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347448485l/892219.jpg", "reviews": 7, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/191136.Samuel_Pepys", "name": "Samuel Pepys"}], "type": ["History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/892219.The_Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys_Vol_7", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/420490.The_Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys_1666", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1344984.The_Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys_Vol_VII", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2725219-the-diary-of-samuel-pepys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/420481.The_Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18623310-diary-of-samuel-pepys---complete", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24874313-the-great-fire-of-london", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/892153.The_Illustrated_Pepys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/733529.The_Diary_of_Samuel_Pepys_Vol_1"]}
