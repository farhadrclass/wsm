Reflecting, I realised that it wasn't my first encounter with this author. I read The Dream Giver whilst serving on-board a missionary ship. A friend highly recommended it so I found it in the ship library. I remember being disappointed and thinking it reminded me of the Christian hedonism principle espoused by John Piper which I don't have much time for.This book is an allegory in the style of Pilgrim's Progress or Hinds Feet on High Places but it falls short in every area by comparison. The main reason it falls short is because the underlying principle is erroneous--it is all about living our dreams in the here and now or as Joel Osteen would say \"Your best life now...\" It might be a \"nice story\" but encouraging people to focus on their earthly dreams, ambitions and successes even with God in the picture is a recipe for disaster.This book was not as offensive or dangerous as the Jabez one, I just think its focus is in the wrong place and it may distract people from taking up their cross and following Jesus. Also, what happens when the inevitable suffering and trials come or dreams fail?......let's set our minds on things above instead, then we won't be shaken."}, {"userName": "K.D.

That prayer is based on the passage from the Holy Bible (1Chronicles 4:9-10) that goes like this:Jabez was more honorable than his brothers. His mother had named him Jabez, saying, \"I gave birth to him in pain.\" Jabez cried out to the God of Israel, saying, \"Oh that you would bless me indeed and enlarge my territory! Let your hand be with me, and keep me from the evil one.\" And God granted his request.Wilkinson basically expounded on this prayer to encourage his readers to outlines his or her life and what he wants to do and raise that plan to God so it will be blessed by God.Here in this book he expound it some more: to include dreams in the plan. We all have dreams when we were kids but those dreams are probably dead now. Maybe they are not practical. Maybe they don't make sense anymore. My dream when I was a kid is to be an agriculturist. Then later it was to become a teacher. Then to become a priest. However, my father's dream for me was to become a doctor so I took up Medical Technology (a popular pre-med course) but when I finished it, he did not have money to send me to a medical school so I worked and while working finished my second degree, business administration. Now, I am an Information Technology (I.T.) career in an electronics manufacturing company. Haha.Should I pursue my dream of becoming an agriculturist even now that I am in my 50's? If I were to ask Bruce Wilkinson, his answer will be a resounding yes. Haha. Oh well, maybe ten years from now when I retire from corporate world, I'll try to go back to the province and plant crops in the farm. Or maybe I'll write (not a boyhood dream but something that I think I'll enjoy doing). One thing is sure though: I will keep on reading.Anyway, the book also gives an outline on what to do to pursue those dreams regardless of ones' age or life predicaments. Wilkinson only wants us to dream and to pursue it."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2057571-julie", "userReview": "This book came at a crucial time in my life. It is a quick, simple read, but very profound. I found this information to be helpful in this new season of transition in my life. I learned that fear is just a four letter word and it is time to move with passion to reach my dreams. Yes, I said dreams with an \"s\", because life is full of many great things to achieve. Just holding to only one dream in life is too limiting.

The author wanted to be my \"Dream Coach,\" excuse me? 'What a load of inspirational baloney,' I thought. 'This is going to be the cheesiest thing ever.'But I had a few hours to kill, and the book was thin enough and written in big print, so I gave it a shot.I think this cheesy little book of inspirational baloney has changed my life.I am so encouraged, so emboldened, and so convicted by it that I have no choice but to make a choice. There is more to life than what most of us are living, and God placed us here with the precious gift of life for a reason!I would encourage anyone to read this, and read it with an open mind. Maybe even take a break from reading it to stop and think - and pray - about what God is laying on your heart. You could easily read this entire book in one sitting and blow it off, but I would really encourage you to take some time with it and maybe even read it more than once at different times in your journey.It's very possible that in a few years' time, I will owe my happiness to this book.

At $17 for what would only be about one hundred pages if font, line spacing and margins were normal, it's pretty expensive.Wilkinson is a great communicator. His The Three Chairs and Prayer of Jabez are classics of inspirational literature. The Dream Giver however does not meet those standards.

Yet I also believe the dream inside me was planted by God and fertilized by others who love Him.

No one else can do your Dream.\" ~ Bruce Wilkinson, The Dream Giver, Page 75, Paragraph 5God is our Dream Giver and He has deposited something very special inside everyone of us. He has give us a calling, giftings, talents, abilities, etc. that He has not given anyone else on this planet.The realization I came to when studying this book was that I am the only one who can fulfill the vision or dream that God has given me and if I fail, then others will be affected as well. It made me realize that I have a lot of responsibility to fulfill the dreams and visions that God has given me. Bruce Wilkerson becomes your dream coach through this book. He starts off with a parable of man called \"Ordinary\" who wants to be a \"Somebody\", but the ordinary way of life is holding him back, as well as bullies. The parable takes you through the thoughts and actions of the character to the end of accomplishing his dream. The dream at the end of the story may surprise you. I'll give you one hint...it isn't about you, it's about taking care of others.I liked the questions that were scattered throughout this book and made every effort to write an answer them. Some of them are:* What have I always been good at?* What needs do I care about most?* Who do I admire most?* What makes me most fulfilled?* What do I love doing most?* What have I felt called to do?There is only one criticism I have for this book is that it failed to provide a practical way of accomplished your dreams. I highly recommend a book called, \"Mentored By A Millionaire\", by Steven K. Scott and using a skill he provides in this book called \"Vision Mapping\". This is one of the greatest skills that I know for reaching your dreams. Otherwise, I was greatly encouraged by this book and I think it is required reading for those who want advice about the tug that God has put on your heart - Your Dream."}, {"userName": "Valerie Caraotta", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19022887-valerie-caraotta", "userReview": "The Dream Giver is comprised of two parts with part one including a fictional story on fulfilling your dream. Part two is where author Bruce Wilkinson becomes our dream coach and answers questions people have posed, especially the obstacles, that create uncertainties about their pursuits. Additionally he reviews key points from chapters in his fictional work and tells us how to apply each stage in our advancement toward our dreams. It is God's desire and high calling that we become all we were created to be and do. You will see in the story that as we embark on the journey to fulfill the dream, we encounter obstacles along the way that will try to deter us from advancing. These obstacles can be in the people closest to us as well as things like fear, rejection, and insecurities. Although a fictional piece, you will clearly understand the process of fulfilling your calling and the necessity of the dark times- Wastelands- encountered along the way. Each step of advancing toward your dreams will leave you with choices only you can make.Shared in this book also will be five common misconceptions that keep people from pursuing their God-given dreams and strategies for how to hang on during trying times. This book is super for all ages including young Sunday school classes. The options to be creative in sharing these ideas are numerous. The sooner the younger generation can embrace destiny and position themselves the better off is all of us as a result of talents and gifts being used for the glory of God. Author Bruce Wilkinson will share his personal \"Dream Giver\" experience and how the risks of leaving a fruitful past resulted in an even better future. His life experiences bring great validity to this book's theme message."}, {"userName": "Kent Thai", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12167793-kent-thai", "userReview": "This was a very interesting book. Half of the book was a story, while the other half of the book was a lesson about life which was very religious. The story was very interesting and had a nice meaning behind it. The names that Bruce Wilkinson give to the characters are symbolic as well. The story was about a person who wanted to pursue his dream and in order to do so, he had to leave his city, Familiar, and had to face multiple obstacles such as border bullies, and giants which where representative of real-life obstacles. He eventually achieved his goal. He took the risk and did what the Dream Giver, or God, told him to do. In the end he got his goal back, and God's trust. The second half of the book explained how the author, Bruce Wilkinson, went down the same trek in real-life. As he explained his journey, he also explained how it related to the story.

This is another spiritual fill-up! Loved this book mainly because I could see so much of myself through the lens of the protagonist Ordinary. Now I don't want to spoil the fun for anyone but basically this book talks about Ordinary who lives an \"ordinary\" life until one day he is moved to go after his calling. Although Ordinary is fired up and ready to take on this challenge, it is hard for Ordinary to do this because he knows that it requires him to move out of his comfort zone. Though Ordinary faces some obstacles like fear and doubt from within he also faces some these adversities from those closest to him, he is able to ultimately push through all of the adversity and understand his \"big dream\"/ calling. Now this was a church wide study at my church \"Impact\" where my Pastor's broke down the book to make us understand the importance of this book right here! I have put together some basic conclusions/connections from my pastor's mouth and directly from the book:-God has a way of showing up in the familiar-God has a way of showing up when we think we've got it all together-If nothing is broken, than you do not believe in faith-Not only does God show up but he also shows up with a word-The word disturbs your unfamiliar-Do you want to be ordinary or extraordinary? When you choose extraordinary, you have to be willing to be set apart.-God wants to take you new places but we still carry old luggage?-There is more that God requires of us-Remember, return and reset-Where God gives vision God will also give provision-Your familiar is your comfort zone is what you know-Comfort zones are temporary --> careers, emotions, friendships, homes etc.,-What have here won't get you there-What blessed you to make it to level A will be a hinderance at level B-When you disturb your comfort zone, it disturbs others as well-The borderland is a place of transition & decision- Transitions --> Not everyone that starts with you will finish with you-Along the way expect to have a couple of funerals but don't get stuck at the cemetery (Come on SOMEBODY!!)-Decisions-->Be strong, be courageous, listen to God and he will give you what you need-Expect at your boarder to have boarder bullies aka doubters-Some of the hardest arguments and some of your biggest bullies are the people closest to you-The promise land is at hand.. The closer the promise is the more difficult your journey will become-In order to reach your dream, you need to show up to claim your blessing. God says wherever your feet touches, I'm going to give it to you-When you become comfortable, God starts to work w/in you againAgain, because I don't want to spoil the book, I'll just leave this right here: ENJOY!"}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29139967-alex", "userReview": "3.5/5 starsI think the book was a little too religious for my liking.

As a professional translator, this bothered me a bit, but I think that someone who doesn't do that for a living wouldn't really care or even notice, so I'm not too upset about it; just enough to mention it and then let it go. The overall message about following your dreams was inspiring to me. Even when there was so much God talk in it.
