I loved the story and waited anxiously for the people who checked out the sequels at the library to hurry up and return them. But Sirensong, compared to the other two books, was just not good. The characters didn't do anything out of the ordinary so I grew bored of them, and same for the plot. The parts that weren't predictable still weren't very unnerving. Like with Elizabeth. That was more like an \"oh\" moment rather than a \"whoa\" moment. And the action scenes aren't very action-y. Oh, and don't even get me started on our sixteen-year-old protagonist's reactions\u00a0to pain. But I'm being messy, so I'll take this one step at a time.\u00a0Like the first two books, I have mixed feelings about Dana. She's strong-willed and can be smart. She isn't too naive and can take care of herself. But I don't know, maybe it's just the dialogue. Some of the things this girl says and thinks just screams 'bratty' and 'childish'. I get the feeling that she's supposed to be this Rose Hathaway-esque (Vampire Academy by Richelle Mead) kind of character, but she falls much too short.\u00a0Ethan isn't the same derri\u00e8re-hole we met in the first book. The Hunt thing changed him, and he won't ever be the same. But like I said in my Shadowspell review, I still think he wouldn't have changed without that experience, even if he really did care about Dana.I don't hate Kimber, but I don't find anything in particular to like about her either. Except maybe the hot posset; I thought that was a really useless and quirky (in a good way) idea.I still love Keane. He's edgy but he's mature and he's smart. I really wish we got to know more about him though. We never even got through the first layer of his bad boy exterior. But even with the little knowledge of him, I found him to have the most personality out of all the characters. He's also the most fey. He's\u00a0just so freaking awesome, and he reminds me of Patch Cipriano (Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick).The Erlking was as manipulative as ever in this book, and I loved that.\u00a0He just makes things a lot more fun.\u00a0Still wondering why his name is Arawn instead of Oberon, but whatever.\u00a0\u00a0 The romance in this book is kind of... meh. Obviously, Ethan and Dana have something... I just have no idea what that something is. What does this beautiful fey boy see in this five foot half-human? And would this half-human still be attracted to this beautiful fey boy if he were as ugly as a troll? Also, I saw that KeanexKimber thing coming from book one, but it still seemed so... fanfiction. I don't see anything between these characters. Why does Ethan like Dana?\u00a0Why does Dana like Ethan?\u00a0Why does Keane like Dana? Why does Dana not like Keane? Why does Keane like Kimber? (Geez, this guy is fickle.) Why does Kimber like Keane?\u00a0The relationships in this book seem like normal 21st century relationships. They do care about each other but how long will that last? Because in YA books they last forever. And I really wished Dana would have had to live a life of celibacy. It would have stressed that not everything is about sex; that true love doesn't need it! Did Ethan really need it?\u00a0\u00a0 Now I am going to rant about something that It really saw as a problem in this book: Dana's reactions to physical pain. I swear this girl has a body made of steel because she deals with pain just fine actually. There are countless times in the book when Dana gets severely injured and \"it took all I [Dana] had not to scream.\" If someone is burning a tattoo off your skin, you are most likely to scream. And when she got stabbed by the inch-long thorns all over her body, of course it didn't effect her afterwards. I mean, it's not like she suffered severe blood loss or anything.\u00a0And now my opinion on the cover. My first thought was:\"She's BLONDE?! It didn't say her hair color in the first book, but since\u00a0everyone else in this book is blonde I assumed Jenna Black would want her heroine to be different but nooo. Gosh, this whole time I'd picturing Alexandra Daddario and...\"And my second thought was:\"Why does she look like Jane Randall from America's Next Top Model? (I swear it's her!) Dana's not supposed to be that pretty. That's Kimber if anyone.\"I'm alright with book covers getting the models wrong, but Dana is supposed to represent this girl who is more than she looks and blondie over there just doesn't do it."}, {"userName": "Shanan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1236813-shanan", "userReview": "Review of Faeriewalker Series collectively.In A Nutshell:Since I read Glimmerglass for the first time, I have been enchanted by this series. I loved the magical world that Jenna Black created. I loved the characters, the adventure, even the love stories. But the element I found completely unique to this series was Jenna Black\u2019s open and honest description of the effects an alcoholic can have on every aspect of the lives of people around him/her. I marvel that Jenna Black was able to fit this message into this series without it feeling preachy or moral-driven. It is fun and it is magical.Review:Sirensong seems to be the end of the series, and I have to say I will miss these characters. I found Jenna Black\u2019s world enchanting and her characters honest and memorable. However, as I looked back on the series after I finished Sirensong, it was not the magic, the faeries, Avalon, or even the love stories that stood out to me. It was Jenna Black's honest and open description of Dana\u2019s life as the child of an alcoholic, and how that affected Dana\u2019s life and decisions. I do not want to insinuate that Jenna Black wrote this series with the primary intent of presenting a message about alcoholism, but I do want to commend her on handling this issue the way she did. Originally, I questioned Dana\u2019s continued willingness to repeatedly disregard advice of her family and friends, which usually led to her putting herself in harm\u2019s way to save them. Is the best solution to sacrifice yourself? However, as I looked at this question within the context of this story and the character of Dana, I realized for Dana the solutions in the book were the best. Dana was a product of her childhood which was filled with loneliness caused by constant moves and shame caused by hiding the secret of an alcoholic mother. It affected the choices that Dana made. It affected how she related to people. It affected how Dana valued the first set of friends she had in her life. I liked the character of Dana, so it was sometimes hard to watch her make the decisions she did; to repeatedly risk her own life and happiness to save another. But that was who Dana was and her decisions showed how devoted she was to the people in her life. At the end of Sirensong, I was glad to see that Kimber took Dana to Alateen meetings. I would hope that with support Dana would learn her own value so she did not feel she should allows sacrifice herself for another. The one issue I had with the series is that the girls seemed to be very critical of themselves, while the boys were presented as near perfect. Kimber, who is an academic genius, can only focus on her mediocre magical skills. Dana, who is a wonderful singer, always feels unattractive compared to the magically attractive full-blooded Fae that surround her. However, Ethan, whose temper is part of why he ends up in the Wild Hunt, knows he is magically gifted and thinks he is almost invincible. Keane, who harbors a lot of resentment about\u2014well everything, has declined his calling as a knight. The standard of a successful girl with high self-esteem seems to be much harder to reach than the standard for the boys.Overall, I loved the series though. The magical spell that Jenna Black casts took me in and despite the seemingly unending danger, I wish I could visit Avalon and bring Dana some coffee."}, {"userName": "Kathy (Kindle-aholic)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4612721-kathy-kindle-aholic", "userReview": "[If you haven't read books 1 and 2, don't read this review! I'm trying to be vague, but don't want to be spoilery!]I thought that this was a very good end to the trilogy, and a good personal arc for Dana.We get to see Faerie, there is lots of courtly intrigue, some romance, a lot of running, and all of Dana's secrets come out. I'm glad that the love triangle never played out. Everything is also not roses there either - Dana is unsure about her future with Ethan and I find that very realistic for a teen, especially one with Dana's past. I liked the interactions with the Wild Hunt, too.Throughout the trilogy, she's been trying to save everyone - herself included. Dana has to face some hard facts in this one. She also has a lot of trust issues, stemming from growing up with an alcoholic mom. Book 1 starts with Dana running away to find her father to escape living with her mother, and in the hope that this act would shock her mother into admitting she has a problem. I really liked how the story came full circle. It is not all wrapped up in a little bow, but Dana has grown from her experiences. She's also sill a teenager - her life is not decided yet. She has learned that there are people that she can depend on, and that's one of the best parts of the book."}, {"userName": "Princess Bookie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1218813-princess-bookie", "userReview": "My Thoughts: We are once again back with Dana and her gang of family and friends. Dana has been living with her father in Avalon for a while now and there is never a dull moment. Dana and her father attend a party hosted by Prince Henry and he invites them on a trip to see the Queen. Invite is a strong word, they have go to otherwise it's disrespectful and could start a fight.Dana insists to her father that she be escorted by her friends Ethan and his sister Kimber. Her father lets them come but is a little unsure of it, but he figures Ethan can also watch her back and protect her. Of course Finn and his son Keane are also coming. I loved how much we see of her friends in this novel. I loved how her relationship with Ethan is growing and Keane is also around more. I still want to see more of Keane! But even though we know he had a crush on Dana, he is now focusing his attention more on Kimber. They start on their journey and figure they will be save with Henry's entourage since nobody would dare attack them! Of course things do not go as planned and they do get attacked. We also realize that Erlking is still around and is following Dana.Erlking is a mysterious character. We know that he looks out for himself and if its in his best interest, he'll do it. But he protects Dana a lot more than he has too. He kind of feels an allegiance to her I suppose. Even though we're supposed to fear him and loathe him, I always find myself liking him and his sense of humor. He makes things more interesting. We also see more of Dana's brother who is in the Wild Hunt.Once, they all get to the Queen's there is an attack and Dana is the one whose at blame since she's the only one who can carry technology in. So they all run, even though she's innocent. They are on the run with nowhere to go! How did the technology get in? What happens when Erlking decides he wants Dana to himself and sends Ethan after her? Will the romance ever go further with Ethan because once Dana gives her virginity up, since Erlking can step in and own her power? Is it worth it? Does Dana become a better fighter? Does she live or die? Read the book now! Overall: Loved Sirensong! I think I loved this one more than the first two. The trip to the Queen's was interesting. They are on the move a lot so lots of things happen. She sees weird things she's never seen before. When Dana is wanted by the Queen, she is quite brave and does anything she has to in order to survive. We also see her powers developing more and realize just what she can do! I loved Sirensong, I hope you do too! Cover: She's so pretty! I also love how she is leaning down on her hands.

I got really sick of the repetitiveness of issues, such as 'I can never have sex with Ethan and it's oh so hard' (or not hard at all..excuse my inappropriateness). It wasn't the fact that it was an issue that bothered me, it was more the fact that the same thing was being said over and over again. It was similar with Dana and her mother's alcohol problem. As soon as anything at all was mentioned to do with alcohol I felt like, 'oh great here we go again with another description of how Dana's Mum is an alcoholic who is in denial!'. I understand what the author was trying to do, in that she was attempting to make the issues Dana was experiencing deeper, but in my opinion it didn't work and it didn't feel as though the story flowed naturally. I also had a problem with the inappropriateness of the intimacy between Ethan and Dana, particularly when they were stuck in a hole right next to Kimber and Keane. It was just plain wrong and it made me cringe. The Erlking is another thing that really doesn't seem right. He is supposed to be some big evil tough guy, yet all evidence points to the contrary and yeah sure he is supposedly some weird creepy guy who takes the virginity from girls to steal their power but realistically there is no evidence to suggest that he actually does this. His actual voice and character just doesn't seem to match the person that he is supposed to be - but hey perhaps there is some kind of weird mysterious twist for the next book that will make it all alright! Overall I have to say that unfortunately the voice of Dana just really seemed to bug me in this one."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/298806-rachel", "userReview": "The last place Dana Hathaway ever imagined she\u2019d have to go was Faerie. With both Queens of Faerie trying to kill her, she never thought her father would accept an invitation to visit Queen Titania of the Seelie Court.Being presented at Court is supposed to be an honor, but when you are a Faeriewalker, like she is, the reason for the invitation is definitely suspect. And although they were promised safe passage and an escort, including Prince Henry himself and his Knights, traveling through Faerie is not likely to be as easy as everyone seems to believe.As much as Dana would prefer to leave her friends behind, to keep them safe from harm, knowing that they\u2019d be coming with her makes this perilous journey somewhat less frightening. And even though she and Ethan are even more at risk due to the Erlking\u2019s influence in Faerie, just having him there with her makes her feel more secure.But when a surprise attack nearly costs Dana her life and the life of her friends, the feeling of foreboding she has gets stronger. If the Queen\u2019s promise of safety can\u2019t even protect her son and his entourage, how can she possibly think she\u2019ll make it to the Seelie Court, let alone make it back to Avalon, with her life, and her secrets, intact.If Dana can\u2019t figure out how to protect herself from the politics of Faerie and keep her friends out of harm\u2019s way, none of them may ever see Avalon again. And if she can\u2019t keep her distance from the Erlking, she may become the Wild Hunt\u2019s next rider.And she thought things in Avalon were complicated.***Sirensong, the third book in the Faeriewalker series, takes readers on another exciting adventure with Dana Hathaway \u2013 this time leaving the relative safety of Avalon for the significantly more dangerous world of Faerie.The story picks up just shortly after everything that transpired with the Erlking and the Wild Hunt in Shadowspell. Dana is still living in her safe house, continuing to train with Keane and trying to figure out a way out of the bargain she made with the Erlking.As she heads off to Faerie with her father and her friends, Dana is still keeping secrets about just what happened with the Erlking, secrets that may put more than just her friendships on the line. And leaving behind her alcoholic mother, who refuses to even admit she has a problem, makes Dana even more worried about what she\u2019ll be returning home to, if she is even allowed to return.Sirensong is a bewitching story of Faerie magic, heroism, bravery, love and friendship. As Dana tries to navigate the complex landscape of Faerie, she learns more about the power of honesty, about who she is, what she is capable of, and the importance of friendship.Jenna Black has written yet another charming and completely captivating story in the series. There are a few surprises, someone new to keep an eye on, and a slightly darker turn for one of the character. And although this installment may not have quite as steamy a scene as there was in Shadowspell, there is just as much tension and a few heart-racing moments that will entice.This book is a must read for fans of the series and for readers who enjoy an enchanting adventure through the magical world of Faerie, with a bit of a mystery to piece together, a few ulterior motives to uncover, and a heroine who is brave, incredibly determined, and who has some pretty cool powers.On a personal note:This series is such a yummy distraction from reality. I absolutely love the author\u2019s writing style. It\u2019s so easy to caught up in the adventure. And this one is definitely an adventure.Finally Dana gets to go into Faerie. I couldn\u2019t wait to see how the author treated this magical place. And although I didn\u2019t get to see a lot of Faerie I loved her take and was completely sucked into the journey \u2013 Green Ladies, Brownies, Bogles and all.The author does a great job at the beginning of filling in all the pieces, so that you technically don\u2019t have to read the first couple of books in order to read this one, but I still wouldn\u2019t recommend skipping them. As much as you can get caught up with the story, you won\u2019t have developed your connection with the characters. And you won\u2019t really know Ethan, Keane or Kimber enough understand why they react as they do.If you\u2019re reading all three books in one sitting, the rehash may slow the pace, which doesn\u2019t really pick up steam until they leave for Faerie, but if it\u2019s been awhile between books it is super helpful.Once Dana arrived in Faerie I was not able to put the book down. And between her practice fights with Keane and how Ethan dealt with his jealousy, there were some seriously entertaining and laugh out loud moments.After Shadowspell, the Erlking, also known as Arawn, was my second favorite character, but now I think he\u2019s my favorite. I still love Dana, but the flawed half-mortal that she is, is really no competition for the age-old leader of the Wild Hunt. He\u2019s conniving, he\u2019s gorgeous, he\u2019s wicked cool and he seems absolutely intrigued by Dana. Maybe even a little frightened of her, though he\u2019d never admit it.Dana is still lovable, with her sarcasm, lack of interest in all things girlie, and her tough and determined streak. And I like that she seems to be getting more of a dark side \u2013 maybe it\u2019s her faerie half shining through. I\u2019m interested to see where that might lead, so I\u2019m keeping my fingers crossed for a fourth book.But as this story wraps up without a cliffhanger, I\u2019m now terrified to think that there might not be a book four. I still think there are more adventures to be had with more story left to tell, I just hope the author does too.So, in order to keep my hope alive, I\u2019ll just say I can\u2019t wait to read the next book in the Faeriewalker series.And yes, I realize that Dana and the Erlking would probably not be the best couple \u2013 she\u2019s young and he\u2019s ancient \u2013 but still, their personalities make them a great match."}, {"userName": "Shera (Book Whispers)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3167178-shera-book-whispers", "userReview": "The love square comes to an end!! Nothing brings me more pleasure when a painful love triangle comes to end, or so I thought. It brings me greater pleasure when a terrible love square ends!! It is a great thing for this series since I love it so much.What\u2019s not so great is that it\u2019s not Ethan who gets the can, no I think Dana actually loves him more. It\u2019s my dear Keane, but in this case it\u2019s OK. As a team Keane fan, I think I can speak for us all when I say he went to a better love interest. In defense of Ethan, he\u2019s actually grownup a lot. The ordeal of being under the Erklings thumb has matured him, that doesn\u2019t mean he loses those annoying-boy-wine moments. It\u2019s safe to say he still gets on my nerves, but I can deal with him now. The role of the Erkling really gets confusing in Sirensong. His actions are still pretty self serving, but he does things that make you wonder about him. Maybe deep down\u2014past his scheming and manipulative core\u2014he\u2019s a decent guy. Well . . . enough that I can say I don\u2019t feel too guilty for swooning over him. After all he killed that nasty bargain about Dana\u2019s virginity dilemma. Thank you!!Another great thing is that Dana\u2019s magical powers are used more and we get to see them develop. Her ability to make the Faye mortal is chilling, and she\u2019s started to add a little more \u201cphysical\u201d power behind it. The magic of the fairy realm also gets explored, though it stays firmly within the Seelie Court. It\u2019s pretty much the standard \u201cvision\u201d of the fiarie realm. You know lots of forests, house made to blend in, the vegetation is commanded to move and do what they want, and the Seelie court is a towering fortress. Still it\u2019s lots of fun, I for one never get tired of it.While I don\u2019t think Sirensong is as good as the second book\u2014Shadawspell\u2014it\u2019s definitely another great entry to the series. However, author Jenna Black states Sirensong is the last entry. It\u2019s truly sad. Black\u2019s series has to be one of the most unique takes on fairies in the Urban Fantasy genre. Painful doesn\u2019t even begin to describe how I feel about this series dying before it even gets a decent chance. Worse series get dragged out, and yet the publishers don\u2019t want to endorse this one. Here\u2019s to crossing my fingers that the Faeriewalker books will rise from the ashes and get a second chance. After all this book finished up enough not to be a painful end, but there\u2019s clearly more places it NEEDS to go.Sexual Content: Kana thinks a lot about sex, a lot. Dana has a few make out scenes and she walks in on someone(s) clearly just finishing up with a bedroom scene. There is elitist/family abuse in this book, at times it made me grimace.

But considering I gave it 3 stars, that doesn't exactly speak well of the books, now, does it? This series has been one of the rare ones in which I've found the good guys (male and female alike) to be largely whiny, adolescent, and altogether annoying, and the bad guys tend to be caricatures. With the exception of the Erlking, the bad guys tend to be purely evil, with no redeeming qualities that would make them seem...for lack of a better word, human.Take Henry in this book (oh, and Elizabeth? Could you possibly be any more obvious with the naming, Ms. Black?), he is a parody. It may be possible that I read too many Regencies, but I picture him as a foppish Beau Brummel type, with a pencil-on beauty mark and white powdered face, and he's written as such a jerk that really, it doesn't take a brain bigger than that of a goldfish to figure out who's behind the big mystery here.And the guys, ugh, it got so bad that I'd rather date Dana's dad out of all the other options in the book. I mean, he's a bit stiff, but he's immortal, and Fae, so looks and age are not a factor here. Plus, he's mature, responsible, and he's had a few millennia to tame all that alpha male testonerone that Keane and Ethan can't keep under control. Good god, those two. I just want them to go at it and KO each other out already; they're intolerable enough by themselves, throw them in with each other and the f-s (fists and f-cks) just fly all over the damn place. Just kill each other and be done with it. They're like Abercrombie & Fitch models; nice to look at, but you wouldn't actually want to have a conversation with them, you know?Kimber--I HATE that name, by the way, it reminds me of an overtly cheerful yoga intructionist that I just want to punch in the face when she's chirping at me to lift my ass higher as my muscles scream in protest, which actually isn't too far off from the character of Kimber herself. Oh, right. Kimber. Most annoying friend ever. I actually don't hate Dana as much now that I think of it.

I don't know how to think of his hair: Does he have curtains? Or is it parted at the side? Is it even? Or all different lengths? Why couldn't he have had nice shortish blond hair that fell into his eyes and made him look sexy? But NO, he had to have horrible long hair that probably makes him look like a pirate!Now that's out of the way. The book had a nice plot and I found my self enjoying their adventure through Faerie. There was some pretty good tension and some quality action (which I loved). I thought the book ended quite well. It didn't follow the 'And they all lived happily ever after' thing but I did kind of expect it to end: Ethan and Dana do what they do, Dana's Mum quits drinking, everybody is friends, etc. But it was nice to see that Jenna Black was being realistic!Hope to read her books in the future!! :D"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "2.5 starsMeh.

I say summoned because her father basically feels that they have no choice but to appear or else a full blown confrontation will occur. Naturally, there is danger along the way and only the sudden appearance of Dana\u2019s magic (which she has kept secret from her friends and family) and the Erlking\u2019s arrival in the middle of a deadly battle; saves her from being killed. Without spoiling anything, Dana\u2019s magic is truly awesome and makes her extremely dangerous to anyone who is Fae. She has also kept it hidden from her father, and friends for fear that if anyone learned what she can do, she would be hunted down like an animal and killed.Upon arriving at court, Dana, Kimber, Nathan, and Keane are forced to run after someone tries to kill a court princess. Dana is blamed because she is a Faeriewalker and thus able to bring human technology like a bomb into Fairie. Forced to make a choice; run back to Avalon where she is relatively safe, or return and save her friends. Dana makes the only choice she believes she can make; she attempts to prove her innocence.Sirensong, by Jenna Black, ends the 3-book trilogy called Faeriewalker. The series takes place over the course of several weeks, rather than months, or even years. Even though Sirensong is the last book of the series, it still leaves questions unanswered and an open ended finish to Dana\u2019s story. One of those questions is--was the series/trilogy only supposed to be 3 books, or was the decision the publishers to not go any further?This isn't the worse series ever made and yes it has its moments of brevity that made me continue to read all three books and not abandon it. The series was made for the extremely lucrative YA market, and thus there are things that adults may find idiotic, tiring, or even objectionable like Ethan\u2019s behavior in Glimmerglass, or Dana\u2019s overall trite behavior and pouty attitude when she doesn't get her way with her father.Me, I still dislike Ethan and am damn glad that Dana finds the inner strength and courage to say she isn\u2019t ready to lose her VeeJayJay to him or anyone else for that matter. Others, in a similar situations, would have given it up easily because that\u2019s what is expected from them. Well, not me personally, but you get my point.I enjoyed the interaction between Dana and the Erlking (Arawn) and his gamesmanship in getting people to do what he desires. At the risk of sounding trite, I was not pleased with the way that Dana gave in so easily to his bargain in Shadowspell in an attempt to get Ethan back. Then again, Dana is 16 years old and has been forced to make some difficult choices time and time again just by having an idiotic and useless mother who doesn't realize what her actions are doing to her own kid.I felt like, in the end, Dana finally realizes that there\u2019s not a lot you can do to help someone who refuses to help themselves. You just got to live your life, and hope that eventually things work out for the best. I absolutely understand Dana\u2019s hatred of alcohol and her mother\u2019s actions and choices. Trust me--I\u2019ve lived thru the same bullshite when I was growing up and it wasn\u2019t fun. Probably one of the reasons I enlisted in the military straight out of high school instead of going to college and remaining in a city where I knew I would have to live with the constant nightmares."}, {"userName": "Tonya Hardin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25059438-tonya-hardin", "userReview": "I thought it was good.

That\u2019s what Dana learns at the beginning of SIRENSONG. At least she gets to take her boyfriend and best friend with her. But she also has to take her relentless fight instructor who might or might not be transferring his affections to another, her father, and the queen's haughty son. Almost without fail, I lose a bit of interest when books with fae end up crossing into Faerie. There are the obligatory forests, nasty critters, and not quite normal phenomenons, but I always find the scenes set there\u2014regardless of the book\u2014a bit ho-hum. Sad to say it, but I found that true here too. Fortunately, the last third of SIRENSONG, even set in Faerie, is pretty great. The action, romance, and emotions all kick up ten fold.Don\u2019t expect the same amount of sexy time as in the previous books. There are a few scenes that still push the YA boundary, but they are significantly lighter and less frequent in SIRENSONG. That\u2019s not to say Dana doesn\u2019t think about sex a lot, she does, but it\u2019s in the context of knowing she will never have it and whether or not Ethan will stick around without it. I wish Dana had had more self respect to realize that if Ethan wouldn\u2019t stay without sex then she doesn\u2019t need to waste her time. In that sense, she took a step back from the strength and intelligence I admired in her previously.My biggest disappointment with SIRENSONG is the fact that it is the unintentional swan song for the series (Jenna has confirmed that SIRENSONG is the final Faeriewalker book). It is very clearly not written as the final book since many of the extremely compelling storylines threading through the previous books are left hanging. Is the Erlking secretly not as bad as he pretends? Will Ethan be able to accept the physical limitations imposed on his relationship with Dana? Will Dana\u2019s mom ever acknowledge her alcoholism and seek help? Why is Dana able to use magic when no other faeriewalker ever could? Will Dana break her vow to the Erlking with Ethan or give her virginity\u2014and her powers\u2014to the Erlking as promised? Precious few of these questions are answered in SIRENSONG.Overall, SIRENSONG is another fun foray into a faerie infused world, but there are too many questions left unanswered and too many storylines left unresolved in the series as a whole. It isn\u2019t a cliffhanger, but it isn\u2019t the true series ending either that it needed to be. Jenna has said that she is working on a new YA series and it\u2019s clear by now that she has the writing chops to make it another winner. It\u2019s just unfortunate that this series won\u2019t get the chance to end the way I think Jenna and we readers would have wanted.Sexual Content:Kissing. Scenes of sensuality.

I think. Also, spoilers from the last 2 books, so beware.I guess I liked this series, but I was never really a huge fan of it. I really liked the first book but the second was kind of a letdown, and I was a little skeptical about reading this one. But after hours of staring at the drool-worthy cover, I finally started reading it. And . . . I don't know. Some parts were pretty interesting to read, but I still was expecting more.This book starts off where the Shadowspell left off. Dana goes to an event with her father and meets Prince Henry, the son of the Seelie Queen, Titania. Dana is invited to the Seelie Court, and she's skeptical because she's aware that Titania wants her dead, but eventually they start the long and treacherous journey to Faerie. Ethan, Kimber, Keane and Finn come along as well. But trouble arrives when Dana encounters the Erlking, Arawn, again, and even bigger trouble comes when an assassination is attempted against Titania's granddaughter, and Dana is considered a fugitive.Dana didn't really change or show improvement. I guess I like her, but she kind of annoys me sometimes. She's always treating her mom so badly due to her alcoholism, but she can't seem to understand that her mother is addicted, and addictions can't just go away with a snap of a finger. It needs work.I was sad when Keane was revealed to not be a love interest anymore, because I honestly preferred him over Ethan. Instead, Keane ends up having a thing with Kimber, and at first I thought maybe Dana would show some type of jealousy, then that would make sure that Keane is still a love interest, but no. Dana didn't even show a tiny bit of jealousy. Even when it's revealed that Keane and Kimber eventually have sex.But I do admit that Ethan is a bit more likable than usual in this book, while Keane on the other hand is a lot less likable in my opinion. I'm not sure I'm either of their teams now, really.A lot of bombs drop in this book\u2500no pun intended (if you read it, you'll know)\u2500and for the most part they were interesting enough to keep me reading until I finished it. But overall I would give this book 3 or 3.5 stars. And maybe 3 stars for the series as a whole. It's not exactly one of my most favorite faerie series', but it's still pretty good."}, {"userName": "Mary (BookHounds)", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1378745-mary-bookhounds", "userReview": "***there may be spoilers here -- I tried, but may have let one or two slip***Dana is in lock down in a safe house deep in the mountain of Avalon where she pines for freedom and which she gets through the help of the Erlking's protection. Freedom always comes with a price for Dana. Her presence is requested by Titania, the Seelie Queen, where she is to be presented at court. It all sounds excitingly innocent, but this being a faerie court, there are ulterior motives especially when the invitation comes from Prince Henry who is not her biggest fan. Dana takes Keane, Kimber and Ethan along for protection and companionship. Her father's court intrigue as Titania's consort comes back into play since he replaced Prince Henry's father and Henry has never forgiven him. While traveling though the Faerie countryside, Dana makes an a couple of decisions that on the surface don't seem very important, but play a huge part in her safety. The procession to the castle with Prince Henry shows how much he despises Dana's father and even with Finn and the rest protecting Dana, there are many attempts on her life. The Erlking also makes his presence known and lends his protection, even though he really doesn't have to. I think the Erlking shows more humanity and becomes an important ally in Dana's defense. He is probably my favorite character even though he is slightly evil, he freely admits he only does things are in his best interest. (Maybe we can convince the author to spin off a series just of him maybe for us grown ups!) Dana learns that she has even more magic in her than she ever thought possible. Of course, once they do reach the castle there is even more intrigue.I thought this was the best of the series and although I believe this in the final chapter in Dana's story, I would really like to revisit the characters here again. Dana really grows in this last book and even though she still has her issues with her alcoholic mother and trusting others, she finally learns she has friends that she can lean on. You can see her despair and anger while she deals with her mother and the magical gifts she develops. It is really bittersweet at the end and will make you wish it hadn't ended quite yet."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665\u266b", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2251929-melissa", "userReview": "[the whole \"there's another fairywalker\" was just so...how do i put it?

I loved it much more that Faeriewalker and Glimmerglass combined. It was much more entertaining and a fun a quick read.I must admit that my reasons for purchasing Faeriewalker were quite random (it was the only book I had seen that originally came out in paperback and not hardback...it seemed strange and it was therefore pretty cheap, besides--the cover was pretty and we all know how much i love pretty covers) I liked both Faeriewalker and Glimmerglass, but Sirensong took the cake. Although Sirensong had a slow start like its predecessors, once the action began you couldn't put the book down. I was frequently upset while reading Faeriewalker and Glimmerglass. I felt like Dana was stupid with a lot of her decisions; however, Dana seemed to make good choices (for the most part) during this particular book. I continue to hate her mother, but whats new with that! Dana seems to be growing into herself as a Faeriewalker and I love it. I'd definitely want to be her friend.In addition, Dana and Ethan's relationship has been getting quite hot and steamy and I love it. He's so sweet and yet still a bad boy. He's one of those guys you meet and cant help but feel some sort of attraction to (and it helps that his reputation proceeds him....he is definitely a bad boy!!) I just love their relationship. Dana is the perfect balance to him.I don't want to give too much of this book away because it is so great so I will just tell you all to read it! It is truly great.

I however found that I did not enjoy the 3rd book as much. I honestly think it had to do with the ending. We find Dana travelling to Fairie to meet the Queen per the Queen's invitation. There was plenty of action throughout this entire book. We did not get to see as much of Ethan's and Dana's relationship. We did get bits and pieces but I would have liked to see it grow through out this last novel. However I did enjoy getting to see Seamus (her father) grow by showing actual emotion towards his daughter instead of being so reserved.However the ending left me wanting. It was left completely open. She wnats her father's rules so she doesn't have to face telling Ethan directly she is not ready for the next step. Seriously...she can face down forces that want to kill her and come out on top but she can't just explain to her boyfriend she wants to wait. Then we truly never get closure because at the end she states how the queen of the unseelie court may still want her dead and that she could be in even greater danger now that her power is known. Seriously what kind of ending is that. It's still a cliff hanger in my opinion. I was not satisfied with that ending.Perhaps there will be a 4th book that has not been announced and that is why the open ending so the author can take it in any direction. Or perhaps the author wants us readers to come up with out on conclusion. I like my endings wrapped up in nice little neat bows and I just feel like I was let down on this one."}, {"userName": "Sabrina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3753609-sabrina", "userReview": "Det der \u00e6rgrer mig mest ved denne bog er bagsideteksten.

Just wow. Faeriewalker series most certainly belongs with my all time favourite series. Only handful of series manages to get better with every other instalment and Faeriewalker series managed just that. Carefully building up the tension leading to some pretty amazing stuff.I\u2019ve already made a point of saying that I like the characters, the premise, the world, the urban faerie thing, the sophisticated villain, the kind of screwed up relationships, style of writing, witty dialogues, Dana\u2019s funny remarks, entertaining scenes and situations etc...Sirensong managed to preserve all that and added some pretty heavy faerie politics and magical atmosphere of the Seelie Court. It must have taken ages to find a way to untangle all that was tangled and to make it all work out while abiding all the rules established earlier. Second half of the book was never ending string of unexpected events and complicated twists.And still \u2013 when my favourite character got herself into a fatal ambush I though she has no chance of escaping (for the hundredth time) I couldn\u2019t stop but admire some kind of poetic justice of that situation and I had to laugh at the awkwardness of it.And I loved the ending that was somewhere half-way between \u201chappily-ever-after\u201d and \u201ca bunch of teenagers can\u2019t always defeat all the evil of the world and save the day along with every single innocent life\u201d.

While I enjoyed how Black pieced everything together, I'll admit to being a little sad throughout the majority of this edition. I knew in the back of my head that it was all coming to an end. Goodbyes would be said to these unique characters, wonderful settings and dynamic situations.
