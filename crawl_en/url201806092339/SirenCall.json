Eleanor seems a little lonely, or longing for something, in that first scene. After reading the first pages, I thought that the book was going to be a love story. I expected Eleanor to meet somebody, and she did. But that's where the story took an unexpected twist. It wasn't a mysterious and handsome man that she met, like I expected. In the distance, she saw a woman on the beach. And for some reason unclear to Eleanor herself, she felt mesmerized and drawn to this woman, as if she held a secret to Eleanor's life.\"Give him to me,\" Eleanor keeps hearing, and at first she is not sure if it is her imagination playing tricks on her, if it's the woman talking, or just the sounds of the sea combining themselves in this strange way.But soon, a dramatic series of events starts unfolding that gradually affect all Eleanor's loved ones: first, her dog Jasper, then her husband, then her adult son Oscar. And no matter what happens, it is somehow linked to the mysterious woman on the beach. Great plot twists and a quick read. You won't be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Sheryl Seal", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14175289-sheryl-seal", "userReview": "Based on the Greek mythological creatures, Siren Call was a thrilling read. The author Sonya Dodd cleverly blends the marital problems of Bill and Eleanor with a ghostly woman who roams the shores at their beach home in the small town of Witcombe.Will Bill be led astray or can Eleanor save the men in her family from this mysterious woman?As the story unfolds there is much more to the mysterious woman of the sea and the reader will understand her need for revenge.

As a reader who is difficult to please (because novels need to be written in a very elegant, creative style for me to truly appreciate them, and because plots need to be thick, inventive and, preferably, difficult to predict, in order for me to enjoy a novel), there are many books which I dislike, or even give up reading after several chapters. Despite the fact that I am a reader whose standards are high, Sonya Dodd wrote a novel which I found thoroughly enjoyable: its plot is intricate, its style is excellent, and it is very hard to put down, if only for ten minutes with the objective of resting your eyes, because it is such a gripping read. Another reason why I loved this novel is that Sonya Dodd accomplished a complex feat: incorporating aspects of mythology (which I adore) into a plot which is set in contemporary England. It is my opinion that mythology tends to be set in stories which took place centuries ago, and I tend to think that mythological creatures are immortal and eternal, so I have often complained about the lack of authors who weave mythological elements into contemporary tales. Sonya Dodd managed to accomplish this. Well done!I highly recommend this book to young adult and to adult readers."}, {"userName": "Gemma Farrow", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21420136-gemma-farrow", "userReview": "An unusual and intriguing story. I felt for Eleanor and her having to deal with the prickly nature of her husband. The scenery of their isolated location reflected the deepening coldness and distancing in and of their relationship. Add to this a supernatural element born of an ancient myth, there develops a story that grabs the readers attention and leaves a sense of unease in the heart.

Very eye catching! Let's be honest--cover design matters. This one is muted and unrefined. There isn't anything eye-catching about it. With such a saturated e-book market, this book would benefit greatly from a re-design. Dozens of glowing reviews won't matter if no one stops to look at it.Ok, with that out of the way...Eleanor and Bill live in Smuggler's Cottage, an isolated hideaway near the sea. As empty nesters, their marriage has become routine. But, when a ghostly woman takes sinister interest in their family, ominous incidents begin to derail their tranquility.The dynamic between timid and soothing Eleanor and cantankerous and controlling Bill is the real story here. Both characters go through intense and awkward growth. They learn that in order to survive they must be willing to evolve, to take control and to let go of it. A damaged woman, the villain is a hostile and vindictive spirit bent on forcing her misery onto others. She's a complicated and fully drawn antagonist. Everyone is this story is flawed and real.Beautifully written and with charming language, this was a pleasant read. It was insightful, suspenseful and the characters were well developed and complex. Yes, it's a fun ghost story, but it's a book about family and relationships told as a ghost story--that's what makes this a unique read."}, {"userName": "Jams Roses", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18886275-jams-roses", "userReview": "Siren Call is the first in a trilogy of novels by this author about a siren called Rachel.

The married couple are Eleanor and Bill who use their holiday cottage by the sea to get away from London and relax. Everything seems normal and calm as the couple are obviously in love and comfortable with each other, although each have their own irritating foibles that irks the other half.But the reader is soon exposed to the mystery of the woman on the beach. Who is she? Why is she there? Then the questions become more urgent. What is she? What is her purpose? Why does she want Bill?After Eleanor has an unnerving encounter with the woman while walking Jasper her dog, she rushes home and tells Bill. This is all it takes to crack the marriage wide open. Worse, Jasper goes missing.Unexplained events come thick and fast as Eleanor tries to get a handle on things, but Bill remains aloof, so much so, he leaves Eleanor and stays alone at the cottage. From there things go from bad to horrifying very fast.The chilling events are superbly written in an easy style with a unique angle to a ghost mystery thriller.This FIVE STAR supernatural thriller is a must read for all ghost fans and I highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Alan Hardy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13307914-alan-hardy", "userReview": "This is a cleverly and tightly structured story, which keeps you guessing throughout, with twists and turns continually overturning expectations. The opening section is brilliantly done, graphically sculpting scenes and themes with great skill: Eleanor and Bill, in their forties, their marriage growing somewhat stale, have a cottage by the sea; Jasper, their dog, on its walks along the shore barking at nothing, or nothing that Bill can see; a bodiless voice calling out to Eleanor, \u201cGive him to me\u201d; a face glimpsed by the window; a long-haired phantom-like figure standing by the sea, a beautiful shapely woman in silhouette, but an old fearsome hag up close, seen by some, invisible to others. Don\u2019t forget that throughout history it has been claimed that sirens lure men to their deaths\u2026 This opening atmosphere of brooding darkness and shadowy menace by the sea had me gripped. I won\u2019t reveal any more. Suffice to say the story holds one throughout, with its mix of terror, seduction, shock and suspense, until its breathless finale, as Eleanor is pitched into a life-and-death struggle to preserve her family.

Dodd is an excellent psychological thriller with a fantasy/ horror edge to it.It tells the story of Eleanor who encounters a strange woman, the siren of the title, on a beach in Norfolk and soon her entire life and family get drawn into the play of the mythical creature.The story really took me by surprise as it sets out with a fairly peaceful setting and turns into something so much darker. Eleanor tries to unravel the mystery of that woman who seems to be out to destroy her life. This is really well written, full of great suspense and hypnotizing just like a siren call.It is difficult to describe the story without giving too much away but the ending is very satisfactory and brings all the clarity that the mystery section kept so well under wrap.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Chloe Thurlow", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4843183-chloe-thurlow", "userReview": "A ghost story set by the sea offers all the tools for mist and mystery, delusion and illusion \u2013 nowhere in England is more than an hour from the sea shore and the rocky, labyrinthine coastline lends itself to drama and ambiguity.

Each of the female character studies is insightful, whether it is the predatory nature of Rachel, the siren, Eleanor the wife or her daughter, Jo. The women have one thing in common, their lives are dictated by the influence of the males around them, who are in the main, egotistical, controlling, lust driven apologies for humanity. The women are victims of male domination, in one degree or another. Rachel is bitter and twisted by her horrific, callous death at the hands of a rich, depraved pervert but by the same token, Eleanor has been moulded and shaped by Bill\u2019s suppression of her creativity and verve for life, figuratively beating her down into an image of the docile wife and mother, keen not to rouse her husband\u2019s disdain or ridicule and unable to pursue her own long-buried goals. Rachel\u2019s ability to lure away the menfolk to their death, simply by masking her decaying body with an illusion of what she once was, says more about their willing participation in the promise of temporary sexual gratification, than it does about the siren. This is a novel which looks more at the motive behind a person\u2019s actions, than the outcome of their behaviour. For men, it\u2019s all about the lure of sex, whether they are a rich playboy, a middle aged office worker or a young student. What they see in Rachel is the opportunity to satiate themselves, regardless of morality or marriage commitments and she projects what they most want to see, portraying herself as an embodiment of all their most enticing fantasies. Rachel makes a comment, that \u2018the women were always the ones who spoilt everything for her,\u2019 and that is because she cannot hide who she is from them. They recognise in her, the Jezebel spirit which destroys marriages and steals souls for her own pleasure. Eleanor turns out not to be quite such a pushover as she ends up going into battle for her children but the archetypal stereotypes are cast and while Jo settles down into a life which mirrors her mother\u2019s in an oh-so-happy way, Eleanor\u2019s son shows all the traits of following in his father\u2019s flawed footsteps.This novel drips with veiled cynicism and a sadness that is both penetrating and real. It would be a mistake to read it with detachment, because the reader would miss the subtle nuances and jaded insights which are tucked away in the character portrayals. A good author could write a novel about a ghost who preyed on men and make it work, but this is infinitely better than that. It encompasses a moral judgement on the male species in general and a study of the kind of selfishness which makes many of them tick as they lie, cheat and justify - just because they believe it\u2019s their right to do so but also because they can."}, {"userName": "Writer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18428631-writer", "userReview": "INCREDULOUS PLOT BUT AN OKAY READDo you believe in ghost? evil spirit? If you do, then this story is for you. Actually it's not as much as believing in ghost or evil spirit, for me it's as much as possessing great patience to get you through this book and finish it to the end.The first quarter of this book held a natural element of mystery, the beginning of the story piqued my interest, Eleanor and Bill are at their cottage house vacationing. The scene was at the beach with Bill and their dog Jasper taking a walk. The scene was so serene, almost like a calm before the storm. Yet somehow it holds an air of malevolence, a sense of foreboding, like great danger and impending doom is lurking around waiting to happen. What Eleanor saw at the beach and again by the window of their cottage captivated me and held me in suspense that I was holding my breath afraid of what's going to happen. Then they went home, back to London where they resume their mundane day to day living, Eleanor and Bill's life got so boring and their relationship so tedious and I'm left thinking...WTF? Where is this story going? I wasn't so sure anymore if this is really a chilling, spooky, gripping and suspenseful story as some of the reviewers captions said it would be. It just dragged on and on I had to do a lot of skimming and fast forward to the part that would convince me not to give up. I can't remember how many times I put this book down to clear my head so I can keep on reading.The pace picked up a little on the third quarter of the book, you get a sprinkling of mystery and a little suspense and you get to know a little more of the story behind the ghost, but I also got annoyed that some things didn't make sense. Even the heroine, Eleanor, had some questions to this so called \"ghost\" but were never answered. It was hard to connect to the characters especially not to Bill or Rachel, and the plot?......it was incredulous!I purchased this book based upon the 5 star reviews and strong recommendation of reviewers, I agree it has an element of a little horror, some intrigue and mystery, but I wouldn't go as far as mesmerizing, chilling or gripping and stunning like I was led to believe.

The result is an easy but layered read that lets you know and care for the characters with little trouble.One of the keys to this is also the book's limitation: its storytelling relies heavily on \"telling\" a fact or an emotion rather than fully describing it, and also on alternating viewpoints, sometimes at every paragraph. I found these barriers to being fully drawn into the mood, but it's also a reason it's easy to understand the characters so quickly. It's a simple form of older but honored styles, and if it cuts corners, it always knows which angle to twist ahead to show.Readers wanting to be chilled or seduced by smooth description may want to refuse this Call.

I think all three perspectives were necessary to the story, but I found it confusing when they shifted rapidly, so I didn't enjoy the story as much as I could have.The plot seemed predictable in places, though I admit some of my predictions didn't come true. No, I don't do spoilers, so I won't elaborate on those.I also liked that Dodd's target audience definitely isn't teenagers.
