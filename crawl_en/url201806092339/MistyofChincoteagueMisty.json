It wasn't one I'd planned on reading aloud because I thought maybe it was too old-fashioned, and the details of the wild pony round-up tradition on Chincoteague Island might be a little esoteric for present-day youth, but it worked out well; another beloved book from my childhood is now beloved of my seven-year-old boy. I'm glad it turns out you don't have to be a girl to love a book about ponies. We're heading South to visit my mom next week, and there in the basement of her house is the old collection of Breyer model horses from when my sisters and I were kids, Misty included. I think the time has come to pass her down to the next generation, chipped ear and broken hoof and all.My son was gripped by the story, and at one point during the reading, he said, \"I hope that the Phantom and Misty are still alive, so I can go to Chincoteague Island and round them up!\", and I had to gently explain to him that the book was published in 1947 and ponies generally don't live much more than twenty years. But I told him he was right in thinking that the Phantom and Misty were real. \"This is a true story\" I told him, \"and this is a special copy of this book. Look I have something to show you.\" I turned to the title page and showed him four penciled signatures. Paul Beebe. Maureen Beebe. Clarence Beebe (Grandpa). Ida V. Beebe (Grandma). \"Look, the real characters from the book signed their names here.\" If there's one thing my son does well, it's that utterly gratifying shiny-eyed \"wow\" look that makes everything worthwhile. So then I tucked him and his brother in and then went and looked up Misty on Wikipedia -- and promptly wished I hadn't. According to what I read, the real-life story was actually quite different from what's told in the book. But well now, we all know about how unreliable Wikipedia is, right? Obviously someone was messing around with that entry. I'm pretty sure the true story is still between the pages of my special copy. And now I'm off to mapquest to see how feasible a detour to Chincoteague VA is on a trip from NYC to DC."}, {"userName": "Calista", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16731747-calista", "userReview": "I loved this story. I do think it was mis-named. It should have been Phantom of Assateague Island. The story is more about the Phantom and the legend built up around here than Misty. Misty is like a secondary character in this story. I didn't know this was based on a true story. This tells the history of how the wild horses ended up on Assateague Island to begin with. It's fascinating. It was written in the 40s and some of their thinking comes through of course. Paul and Maureen are children living on a horse farm. Paul gets to go to the horse round up on Assateague. Maureen can't go. Then during the race, Paul could have let her race the Phantom and they let a wishbone decide and of course it's Paul for the win. I knew that would happen as soon as it was set up. Anyway.I loved reading about horses and their stories and the story of Chincoteague. I haven't been and now I would love to. This is a fantastic story. I think I might read more of this series. I do enjoy the prose of Marguerite Henry. Fun books. I want to see how Misty turns out."}, {"userName": "Manybooks", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2970379-manybooks", "userReview": "Marguerite Henry's Misty of Chincoteague novels present one of my all time favourite horse-based children's literature series (or rather, the first three books rank amongst my personal favourites, as I really do not at all like the fourth instalment). And as such, I have never been able (or even all that willing for that matter) to write an actual review of the first three books of the series. I did recently pen a very critical review of the fourth book, of Misty's Twilight (which was published decades after the first three novels and does not feature either Misty or the Beebes), but as I rather majorly despise said novel, it was actually not all that difficult to post not at all laudatory musings and analyses, whilst with the first three instalments of the series, with Misty, Sea Star and Stormy even writing a review, even starting a review has been and continues to be much more personally daunting. Not only am I well aware of the fact that with the first three Misty books, I am rather massively and personally positively biased, but also, like with many if not most of my childhood favourite reads, I also tend to have the personal feeling and even the nagging suspicion that any and all interpretations and analyses I might decide to provide will be, at best merely a pale and even perhaps somewhat cracked reflection of the actual work(s), of Marguerite Henry's narrative skills. However, I do think it is now time to attempt to consider a review of at least the first Misty book, of Misty of Chincoteague, and to explain, or perhaps more to the point try to explain why and how Marguerite Henry's Newbery Honour winning horse novel has always been such a sweet and evocative favourite (so much so that I still regularly reread and always enjoy it). And even though I am as an adult more than well aware of the fact that as a novel of the late 1940s, there are, of course, instances of datedness, of signs of the times, of annoying sexism, this does not and never has diminished my love of and for Misty, her horse and human family, her antics, her exploits (as an adult, I might well and increasingly see and notice instances and potential issues worthy of discussion and debate, but I still massively and lastingly simply and utterly adore Misty of Chincoteague as both a novel and as a delicate and realistic portrait of early to middle 20th century life on the Eastern Seaboard of the United States, the close family ties, the daily lives of the Chincoteaguers, whether they be horse-people, water-people or chicken farmers). While Marguerite Henry has created nuanced and realistically developed characters throughout (as even many of the minor characters who make an appearance in Misty of Chincoteague are portrayed not as simply basic stock personages but as living, breathing entities with clearly defined personalities and both laudable and not so stellar character traits), the main human protagonists (the Beebe family, Grandpa, Grandma, Paul and Maureen) really and truly do sparkle and shine. I love the sense of natural and respectful responsibility and the in many ways massive amount of freedom that Paul and Maureen enjoy (and while Maureen might indeed have more house-bound chores than Paul, when it comes to taking care of the family's ponies, and when it comes to making money in order to try to purchase the Phantom come Pony Penning, their responsibilities are not only the same, they are approached as and seen as equals by especially Grandpa Beebe). Now granted, it is indeed true (and uncomfortably so) that especially young Paul Beebe often does seem at least on the surface to be the one and main individual who displays the most blatant and obnoxious sexism (usually and especially towards his sister Maureen). But that being said, if one then actually considers Paul and Maureen's relationship as older brother and younger sister, Paul's behaviour becomes more and more like simply an opinionated and full of himself older brother lording it over or at least attempting to lord it over his younger sister (thus more a case of sibling squabbles and sibling rivalry than mere sexism). Yes, Paul often chides Maureen for being \"a girl\" but really, his little and not so little put-downs are generally and for all intents and purposes an older sibling poking nasty fun at a younger sibling (or trying to show how much smarter he or she is than the younger sibling, which in my humble opinion, usually stems from a low self esteem and a resulting desire to make oneself appear as superior in some way). At least Paul and Maureen do both have an equal (and thus a fair) opportunity to ride the Phantom in the big Pony Penning race (the fact that Maureen ends up losing, that she figuratively and literally draws the short straw so to speak is just bad luck on her part). And that only Paul is able to ride (to participate) in the actual Pony Penning roundup, while that little scenario is indeed more than a bit sexist in and of itself, it is however in NO WAY sexism on Paul's part, but simply how the roundup of the Assateague ponies is generally organised, namely that the rules stipulate that only adult men and boys above a certain age are permitted to be part of the actual penning up of the ponies (and I for one am glad that Marguerite Henry has not tried to change the at that time current cultural practices of the Chincoteague Pony Penning celebrations, such as, for example, having both men and women, both teenaged boys and girls be permitted participate in the round-up, as that would be painting a wrong, and thus a false picture of both time and place). As a person whose parents both bred raised riding horses (Trakehners, a German warm-blood breed, to be exact), what has probably always impressed me most with regard to Misty of Chincoteague is how knowledgable especially Grandpa Beebe is portrayed with regard to ponies and horses, and how gentle this often gruff and curmudgeonly man is with regard to both horses and his grandchildren (with children in general). He does not expect Paul and Maureen to use a metal bit on the Phantom, explaining to Paul that the soft plant-based wickie bridle and reins Paul and Maureen had been using are more than adequate as long as the Phantom obeys their commands and follows their directions (and Grandpa Beebe is also and happily not in any way shy about showing his intense pride in Paul and Maureen, of praising them for their care of the Phantom and Misty, for being able to actually gentle a three year old wild Assateague mare enough for her to be ridden and later, publicly raced). And when Paul finally does decide to give the Phantom her freedom (when the Pied Piper comes back for her), Grandpa Beebe both praises Paul and tells his grandchildren that giving the Phantom her freedom, allowing her to return to Assaateague is the humane and thus the right thing to do (and both Paul and Maureen do really know this as well, as both have much horse sense and had been for quite some time wondering whether the Phantom, was really as content and as satisfied with her life on the Beebe's ranch as little Misty obviously is). The ending, with the Phantom being given her freedom (and then little Misty basically making her rounds almost as if to comfort Paul, Maureen and the grandfather) is both sad and sweet, both heartbreaking and uplifting and probably one of the main reasons why Misty of Chincoteague will always have a very special and tenderly sweet place in my heart and in my soul, my being.As to the accompanying illustrations by Wesley Dennis, although they are perhaps not really necessary to understand the story itself, the actual happenings of Misty of Chincoteague, they do provide a glowing compliment of and complement to the text (and I know that my personal visions of how Misty, the Phantom and the Beebes look are based almost entirely on Wesley Dennis' pictorial offerings, so much so that I cannot even consider the Misty series without his evocative and realistically beautiful drawings).And now finally (I promise), with Misty of Chincoteague, Marguerite Henry's writing style, her narration, intensely and with the juices of life itself evocatively does glow. The ample use of Chincoteague vernacular (although I know that some readers have had issues and complaints with regard to this) gives a wonderful and truly rich and expansive sense of time and place (making the featured events much more authentic sounding and feeling than if the characters, if the Chincoteaguers had been simply depicted and described as speaking standard English). And while there might indeed be a few instances where a reader (especially a child just learning to read) might stumble over a potential meaning, most of the vernacular words utilised are more than easily enough discerned from the general context of the plot, of the text. And thus yes, I absolutely and utterly adore Marguerite Henry's Misty of Chincoteague and do recommend the novel most highly and eagerly as a glowing example of what I personally consider a perfectly lovely and in all ways wonderful horse-story for children (and for adults who still enjoy reading books for children)!"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "This was one of the earliest books I read on my own, in part because Mom read it to me until I knew it by heart. She's a horse nut & gave me my first pony when I was 5. We then lived on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, not too far from Chincoteague. We went there for the round up one year & I got to put a real place to the book. The 'Paul' in the book was in his early 30's then, as I recall & I supposedly got to meet him. I was pretty young, about 7 or 8 I guess. I was told he was Paul, anyway. I don't think we got to see Misty, but one of her foals or something. Who knows, but the plaque on the stall said so. It was a tourist trap in a lot of ways, even in the 1960s.Anyway, it was a memorable book, all my kids read them & my wife too. I haven't read it in ages, maybe parts to the kids when they were little, but that's been a couple/few decades, too. I stumbled across this audio version at the library & thought I'd see how it fared both in that format & so many years later. Just fine, thank you very much. It's a true classic.It bothered me that they kept calling foals \"colts\". Don't recall that at all & I would have thought it would have really bugged me years ago, too. I guess it's sort of like people calling horses ponies, a general term. Irritating. I didn't remember Grandpa Bebe's ear hair either. My own hair is now migrating south & my barber spends an inordinate amount of time trimming my ears & eyebrows, so I sympathize with his plight. It was kind of funny in this setting, though. Not at all where I would have expected it.Highly recommended for young & old. If you haven't read it, you should. If you have a young child, this is a great book to raise them on, so long as you don't mind buying them a pony of their own. There are worse addictions, I suppose. If they truly get the horse bug, they probably won't have the money to indulge in any others.;)"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "I had a pony as a kid & lived on the Eastern Shore of Maryland, not too far from Chincoteague.

Well written - good tension and suspense. Both male and female horse lovers have a character to relate to in the book and for an old book, (written in 1947) the girl wasn't thrust into a traditional female role! As an adult reading the book, I found myself thinking more about the rightness or wrongness of the actions and feeling more for the wild horses than for the desires of the children. I felt the rounding up of wild horses and selling off their colts was unjust and inhumane. Fortunately, as the story progressed, the author did a good job of explaining the need for the actions. The story had great elements - hard work to obtain a goal, disappointment and loss, hope deferred, compassion, etc.."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3498889-cheryl", "userReview": "More than \"just\" a horse book.Children have a chance to learn some history and about life in a small, semi-isolated community, and to see what children can accomplish with hard work and patience. I love the theme of freedom & independence. I love the dialect and descriptions that bring the setting alive. I love that it's based on reality.And I love the tidbits that are sprinkled throughout, for example Grandpa's notion that \"Facts are fine, fer as they go, but they're like water bugs skittering atop the water. Legends, now--they go deep down and bring up the heart of a story.\"I don't love the sexism, especially Paul's. All in all, this reads younger and simpler than other Henry books, and therefore is, to me, not quite as juicy and re-readable. But I do believe it's *at least* as worthy of the honor as the other selections of 1948.And I'm glad this story was recognized and popular, helping to ensure the protection of the ponies and other wildlife on Assateague to this day.And yet... I've no interest in the sequels. Have any of you read, or planned to read, those?Oh, and let's not forget the expressive, vibrant illustrations. Because of his partnership with Henry, Wesley Dennis was one of the first illustrators I knew by name and reputation, when I was a child.Oh, btw, I was neither a big fan of horses or historical fiction.

Immediately I thought of horses, and then of Misty of Chincoteague by Marguerite Henry. One of these summers my husband and I hope to travel to the islands of Chincoteague and Assateague in New England, and when we do I\u2019ll have Henry to thank.Imagine growing up on an island where wild ponies roam. For Paul and Maureen Beebe, it leaves them with an insatiable desire to have one for themselves. They even have a particular pony in mind: the Phantom. Some said she was dark like the pine trees; others said she was the color of copper with splashes of silver. When Paul catches a glimpse of her, however, the feature which most stands out is a strange white marking that begins at her withers and spreads out like the United States of America. Now that he\u2019s finally allowed to participate in the pony swim on Pony Penning Day, Paul plans to capture the Phantom. If he does, it\u2019ll be a marvelous feat, given that every other year the Phantom has outsmarted grown and experienced men. One man even had his horse\u2019s leg broken in his attempt. What makes this adventure even more exciting is that it\u2019s based on real people and real events.Every July in Virginia, the Chincoteague Volunteer Fire Department really does hold a Pony Penning Day. The event consists of a Pony Swim, followed by a carnival which includes a Pony Auction. For the Wild Pony Swim, Salt Water Cowboys round-up feral ponies from Assateague Island and drive them across the channel to Chincoteague Island. Later, at the carnival, some of the foals are auctioned off before the ponies are freed to swim back to Assateague Island. Pony Penning Day has taken place since 1925 as a fund-raiser and is now considered a national treasured event. A horse named Misty once also existed. She was even owned for ten years by Henry. As for the Beebe family, the grandparents and the children were real too. One can see photos of them (and of Misty) in Dear Readers and Riders, a question and answer book which Henry wrote in response to letters from fans.As I reread Misty of Chincoteague this week, I tried to figure out what about Henry\u2019s books brings so much delight. After all, there are a plethora of horse stories. But Henry\u2019s is one of the best\u2013I suspect because of how well she can get inside of a horse\u2019s head. When Henry writes about the wild horses, their snorts of happiness over salt grass and their whinnies of excitement over an island of their own, I feel as I am if right there with them. Later, when she tells of how they learned to fall to their knees, then sidle and wriggle along like crabs to escape deep miry mud, I can envision the scene in my head. In fact, Henry pulls me so deeply inside the heads of the wild horses, I struggle at first to accept that any of them might like to live with men. But Henry also makes me believe that at least one of them does: Phantom\u2019s colt Misty. I know this because Misty\u2019s ears pricks to hear the children sing and her lashes lower to invite the attention that brushing brings. Sometimes, Misty even nips buttons on men\u2019s coats and steals flowers from ladies\u2019 hats, when she feels left out of activities. Through Henry, I fell in love with horses.Henry also earned my deep admiration as an author. I\u2019ve read about the hordes of books she poured over in her research, as well as the reams of interviews she conducted and countless hours that she spent on location for each of her books. No matter how many times I read her biographies, however, I still find it difficult to fathom how she turned all her notes, photos, and experiences into these thrilling adventures that have endured for over fifty years. During the first pages of reading Misty, I made myself savor every last detail, which shows the quality of Henry\u2019s writing. After two chapters, though, I had to give up. I needed to badly to know did Paul and Maureen catch the Phantom, were they able to buy her for themselves, did she learn to love them, and what happened to Misty when Phantom\u2019s mate cried for her.When I started posting my teasers about Marguerite Henry, a few of my blog followers shared that they too were Henry fans. I hope that my review has brought fond memories to current Henry fans. For everyone else, you owe it to yourself to discover this wonderful author. Misty of Chincoteague is the first of three books about this beloved and renowned horse. After reading them, you might also enjoy countless of Henry\u2019s other horse books."}, {"userName": "Cindy Kubley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52260329-cindy-kubley", "userReview": "A feel good readThis is a cute story about the ponies on Assateague Island.

It certainly feels like a classic. We enjoyed listening to the narration of this book together. interesting quote:\"'Take good care of my baby,' she seemed to say.

I still remember this book in a hazy way. I remember reading it, and although I have never been a girl who loved horses, this book pulled me in, and held me in its thrall. The way Marguerite Henry described these wild horses was beautiful, and had a way of sitting me right down in their world. I don't know how this book would hold up for me now, but I sure do remember liking it when I was young."}, {"userName": "Candy Atkins", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54959549-candy-atkins", "userReview": "There are some books I wish every kid would read.

Henry writes about a time and place where I wish I could live. That Chincoteague is long past, however. It's a modern touristy place with all kinds of modern problems now. Misty of Chincoteague was a real pony. She had a different pinto pattern as a foal than as an adult (I think -- not %100 percent sure.) This is a fictional version of her early life as a foal. Despite Misty being the title pony, her dam Phantom actually takes up more space.I used to own a hardback edition with full-color plates by Wesley Dennis. I sold it years ago when I needed the cash and was a total idiot to do so. Dennis' illustrations add a whole new dimension to the story. If you are going to buy this book, do it right and treat yourself to a hardback edition with all illustrations, including full-color plates, by Dennis.It's interesting to read this and then compare it to The Pictorial Life Story of Misty, also by Henry. I have not seen the 1961 movie so I do not know how it compares."}, {"userName": "Jenny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1366775-jenny", "userReview": "I never read any of Henry's books as a child. I am not sure why, but it seems like I didn't want to be one of the girls who only read \"horse books\" and so in my mind that meant I shouldn't read them at all. Or perhaps it was because I lived in the middle of a big city and we had little money and so I knew as a child I would never really have a horse or even get to ride one. I'm not certain, but I am glad I read it now. I really enjoyed this book. It, of course, centers around a horse...or actually two. Paul and Maureen, a brother and sister on Chincoteague Island, have been mesmerized by the mare Phantom and want her to be captured and want to purchase her on pony penning day. They work and save and then Paul is actually able to help capture Phantom...and her new foal. Now they are desperate to buy both....but it seems multiple challenges arise in this process.I was pleased by the amount of action as well as the history in the story. I liked Maureen and Paul and liked the warm relationship they have with their grandparents. I liked that they had to work in order to earn enough money for the horses. I liked their genuine concern for the ponies and the gentle way they treated Phantom and Misty. In addition, the language used to tell the story was beautiful. I felt as if I had been transported to Chincoteague Island and was experiencing all of this alongside them."}], "description": "On an island off the coasts of Virginia and Maryland lives a centuries-old band of wild ponies. Among them is the most mysterious of all, Phantom, a rarely seen mare that eludes all efforts to capture her--that is, until a young boy and girl lay eyes on her and determine that they can't live without her. The frenzied roundup that follows on the next \"Pony Penning Day\" does indeed bring Phantom into their lives, in a way they never would have suspected. Phantom would forever be a creature of the wild. But her gentle, loyal colt Misty is another story altogether.", "title": "Misty of Chincoteague\n      \n          (Misty #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17461.Misty_of_Chincoteague", "average": 4.04, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1388279096l/17461.jpg", "reviews": 961, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/10652.Marguerite_Henry", "name": "Marguerite Henry"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/441088.Wesley_Dennis", "name": "Wesley Dennis"}], "type": ["Childrens", "Fiction", "Animals", "Animals", "Classics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17461.Misty_of_Chincoteague", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/861969.Misty_of_Chincoteague", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6994371-misty-of-chincoteague", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1189074.Misty_Of_Chincoteague", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3018426-misty-of-chincoteague", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1326477.The_Whirlpool", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18913125-misty-of-chincoteague", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23437324-misty-of-chincoteague", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17875788-misty-of-chincoteague", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/423156.King_of_the_Wind", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/296125.Stormy_Misty_s_Foal", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/123196.Brighty_of_the_Grand_Canyon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/79667.Justin_Morgan_Had_a_Horse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/901311.Black_Gold", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
