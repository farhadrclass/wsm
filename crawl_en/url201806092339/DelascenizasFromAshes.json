{"ratings": 26646, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Ava Oceana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5832186-ava-oceana", "userReview": "This review contains unmarked spoilers.TAKING CHANCES and Oceana are not friends.We are not friends at all.Not because that plot twist completely crushed my heart, or because the main character didn't end up with whom every one wanted. It was because I purely and truly despised that book, and for some crazy, unexplainable reason, I decided to read FROM ASHES. In all honesty, I was hoping it would be be much better than its predecessor, so I could write a nice review instead of a incoherent, angry, babbling rant. I didn't expect much, but a girl can dream.And once in a while, one shall stumble across a book that makes their blood boil and their vision red. It was unfortunate that for me, I found several books like that this year. But both of Ms. McAdam's books were near the top of 2012's fume list.SynopsisCassidy Jameson has been physically, mentally, and emotionally abused by her mother and stepfather since her father's death. It is a secret that she keeps completely under lock and key, but there is one person that knows: her best friend, Tyler, who takes care of her when she is hurt and who has been Cass's crutch for years. Tyler takes Cassidy with him to Texas when he attends college, and there she meets his cousin, Gage. It's practically love at first site for these two, but Tyler successfully keeps them apart... for a while, until shit hits the fan and blows the fuck up.RETURN OF THE RICH BEAUTIFUL WHITE PEOPLE IN COMPLICATED LOVE PENTAGONSI need my Aspirin, please.First of all, Cassidy being abused does not belong in this book. It's just a plot device to give Cassidy a problem in life since she has none, a reason to be 'broken', to let Tyler take care of her, and to allow Gage to protect her and eventually end up with her. You could have removed the parts of the book where Cassidy talks about how she's been abused, and it will not have changed in the least. Because in the end, it's not a story about a shattered character who needs some TLC. It's pure love triangle - or actually, a near fucking pentagon - and shoving in a background of abuse in this story is total crap and absolutely out of place. You know what's a real love story with a tortured main character? Pushing the Limits.Anyway, model-handsome Tyler drags Cassidy to Texas, where she meets his hotter cousin Gage (who even knew it was possible to get sexier than Tyler, right?), who, of course, is completely godly and charming and handsome and angelic and unearthly and oh shut the fuck up.You thought you knew insta-love? Hahaha, bitch, you're wrong. These two lay eyes on each other and it's a total nuclear explosion. But what attracts them in the first place? How beautiful they both are, of course! You can't have average or even pretty-looking characters in these books. They've all got to be the most stunning white people in the world.I mean, they look better together than Ian Somerhalder and Nina Dobrev!which is totally not fucking possibleSo while Cassi here is having an orgasm looking at Gage, some chick wraps her arm around Gage and Cassidy, who hasn't even, you know, talked to Gage, starts to get annoyed and angry and even thinks about plotting to destroy their relationship.Says the girl who pages before, claimed that she didn't trust men.OH MY GODS SERIOUSLY WHAT THE FUCK IS THISThis is what Gage says on page thirteen, after meeting Cassidy. HE JUST MET HER, OKAY? I don't give two shits if there was 'electricity'. Electricity my ass. \n\"... I'd already pictured her beneath me.\"\nHe goes on to say how the wind was knocked out of him when he imagined Tyler and Cassi together.THIS IS CREEPY NO ONE NEEDS SOME RANDOM FUCKER THINKING ABOUT HAVING SEX WITH YOU AND MAKING THEIRS YOURS OKAY STOP IT NOW IT AIN'T SEXYTyler manipulates Cassidy and Gage so they can never properly establish a romantic relationship - always ending up with Cassidy or Gage storming off and coming back in several months. However, Tyler blackmails Cassidy into being his girlfriend, or he'll bring her back to her abusive household and she'll loose him. Cassidy accepts.\nTHIS BITCH NEEDS A SASSY GAY FRIEND.Who the actual fuck would even want to stay with an asshole who would blackmail and threaten and manipulate you for SEX? Later, Tyler nearly forces Cassidy to have sex with him, and when she doesn't, he pulls a Travis and comes home with a promiscuous girl (who just had sex with Gage, because without Cassi he's sexually frustrated) and then KICKS CASSIDY OUT IN THE FUCKING SNOW AND SHE ALMOST FREAKING DIES BEFORE GAGE SAVES HER(but later they're friends again, don't worry)Gage beats Tyler up, Cassi and Gage get together, butterflies poop rainbows and puppies fly. This should be the end, right? It's been a long ride, anyway.NOPE, BECAUSE THESE BOOKS JUST DRAG THIS SHIT OUT. Pages and pages and endless chapters of absolutely nothing happening except Gage and Cassidy fuzzy and sexy time - WAIT I HAVE SPOTTED A DRAMA LLAMA, CASSIDY YOU STUPID BITCH, GET OVER YOURSELF BECAUSE HE HAS SEX WITH OTHER GIRLS TOO, NOT YOUR PURE WHITE VIRGIN ASS -\nFinally, Cassidy leaves Texas and goes back home because her house has burned down, killing her stepfather and mother, who left her a suicide note and an 'apology' . She also meets detective Connor Green (he's achingly handsome!), with who she has a 'connection' with.Connection: in less than two weeks, Cassidy is making out with Connor (wait, I thought she had a boyfriend?) and going on and on about how she lurvs Gage, but Connor just understands her because he's been abused too, and oh, why can't she just have the best of both?\nAnyhow, she goes back to Texas, has a lot of sex with Gage in the house that they bought together, and then Connor comes back to confess that he 'needs' Cassidy (\"I need you,\") but she brushes off the horny son of a bitch and tells him to go home. Then, like the rabbits they are, Gage and Cassi screw in more sexy places. Like on their kitchen island.Watch out, innocent children! Stay out of that kitchen!Cassidy and Gage get married less than two months later because marriage is the most important thing in the world to them, and it must be done immediately. Who cares that Cassidy isn't even old enough to legally drink a beer? NO ONE, CAUSE LOVE MEANS MARRIAGE, RIGHT?Then Cassidy gets stung by a scorpion and I finally was like HELL YES IS THIS WHAT I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR? But, alas, she survives (what else?) and it turns out she's already preggers (saw this coming from a fucking mile away) and then suddenly it's years later, and Cassidy has her baby, and another baby, and she's pregnant with her third child. You find out she and her second baby almost died in delivery - her heart literally stopped and started again.\nHey, I used this guy in my TAKING CHANCES review!But seriously? She had to almost freaking die? AGAIN? That is such crap!CharactersCassidy is like this Chihuahua I know called Fifi. She's tiny, stupid, and constantly shaking in fear for no reason. Oh, and a serious damsel in distress. I have almost literally never encountered a heroine who was just so naive and empty and freaking idiotic. I wanted to grab her by the nonexistent balls and fling her around until the parts of her brain settled into the right places. Being apparently abused is not an excuse to be such a moron, because trust me: Cassidy does not act like an abused person (nor does she think about it), and Echo from PUSHING THE LIMITS was also abused and she is far from idiot.Here she is, calling all these girls sluts and shit, and meanwhile she's playing three guys before adding a couple more to the mix. Those girls aren't sluts, but she's kind of a cheater.She is also gorgeously perfect, and beautiful, and supposed to be the girl all the guys want (there are over seven guys that wuv her). Supposedly she's delicate, sweet, and soft-spoken, ALL THE GUYS get into a fight over her, and she's constantly being saved from attempted rape or assault because of how hot she is. But there are no redeeming qualities about her except that she's a 'sandwich making bitch'.The reason for Cassidy not telling anyone that she's being domestically abused is ridiculous. It's not that she's afraid, or her stepfather and mother have convinced her that no one will listen, or that they've just plainly scarred her. She doesn't want them to 'take her away from Tyler'. \nI don't think she realizes that she is about to turn eighteen, and that they're not going to throw her in an asylum for the rest of her life. She's not going to loose shit.And then, while Tyler shoves her onto a bed and starts kissing her roughly, I'M SO SERIOUS, they're like:\n\"Tyler, you know I love you!\"\"But you don't. Not the way I love you. Romantically.\" *humps*\"Wh-what? But you only like me as a friend! I don't understand! *shoves his tongue down her throat*\"I want you!\"\"Tyler, are you okay? We're just friends, and you know that.\"*continues humping her*You must be completely STUPID to not realize they don't like you as a friend anymore. And, hey, when a guy dumps you, it's way worse than being forced to have a sexual and romantic relationship with someone, right?\n\"It wasn't like my Tyler at all, and I was surprised by how much it hurt. It wasn't anything like when Gage broke my heart, but it still felt like someone had punched me in the stomach.\"\n\nShe annoyed me to no end, and the fact that not a single person gave a shit when she went around making out with everybody infuriated me. She was so dumb and plain, I just really, really wanted to bang my head against a wall.Or, er, maybe introduce her to this guy:\nBut I'll spare you, Cassidy, because being head-desk-inducing doesn't deserve the fate you'll get with this American Psycho.Gage is such a boring, possessive piece of plank wood. The only thing he was good for was sex and telling everyone that Cassidy was his property. I have nothing to say about him except that he needs to get his dick under control, because he got a boner every chapter or so looking at her. I will never call my friends 'darlings' again, because he completely ruined it for me and I hated his character, who always needed to pick Cassidy up and save her.\n\"I could claim you as mine.\"\nWE ARE NOT SLAVES YOU ASSHOLE.Tyler is a blackmailing, threatening, manipulative fuckface and the fact that his blackmail is completely written off and forgiven is despicable and disgusting. There was nothing attractive about all the shit he pulled and I hope he gets hit by a truck and dies.Connor is boring and blah, and he has no respect for Cassidy, who already has a boyfriend. The other characters were bland and lifeless and bored the shit out of me. Cassidy's stepfather and mother were sickening people and I'm not sorry they both burned to a crisp.I didn't connect with any of the characters and the development was awful.Romance and StuffDon't even get me started on this bullshit. Gage and Cassidy are one of the fastest insta-love relationships I've ever read, and in between it's eye-rolling angst that I didn't care for.All the people falling head over heels for Cassidy got really old, really fast. She's always complaining about everyone being in love with her, and it really. pissed. me. off.\n\"How was it possible to be so completely in love with someone but have this kind of chemistry with someone else at the same time?\" Go on, Cassidy. Please. Keep on whining while you're making out with Connor. You're suuuuchhhh a likable character, so we don't mind your constant bitching!\nEveryone in the story is a beautiful rich white person, and when Cassidy didn't have any money because her mother took it, guess what? SHE GOT DA MONIES FROM THE WEALTHY-ASS FAMILY OF TYLER AND GAGE, because no white people love story can have a lack of money to do the things they want!There was not one black person in FROM ASHES, or any person that wasn't white, for that matter. And getting married in FROM ASHES is a must. It doesn't matter that they're still young and have a full life ahead of them. Marriage is the most important thing, and once that's over with, you can get pregnant and have a bunch of babies, and then you're allowed to live. Cassidy, like Harper, got pregnant before she was twenty-two, because children can't wait.WritingThe writing in this is terrible. FROM ASHES has several transitions - one page, you'll be in present time, and the next, it's eight months later and you wouldn't even have realized it. There are way too many time changes and it needs to slow down.On a scale of one to Snuggie, how unnecessary is most of the stuff in FROM ASHES?More useless than an On/Off machine.There is also so much useless, needless shit in these books that should've been taken out a long time ago. I thought this was what an editor was for? FROM ASHES should've finished when Cassidy started a steady relationship with Gage instead of dragging us by the hair for another two hundred effing pages of drama, stupid shit, and the epilogue. Leave something to the imagination, gosh! Stop giving your characters a complete future. Cassidy getting stung by a scorpion? ARE YOU SERIOUS? This should have been an extra scene edited out! It's not important to the story! I don't think McAdams realized how many times Gage's pants started tightening. It was ridiculous. That boy has some problem with his penis. It needs to be checked out. And I'm tired of hearing about Cassidy's whiskey/amber/honey/piss colored eyes. WE GET THE FUCKING POINT. WE KNOW.And remember my rant about how people's eyes don't automatically 'darken' like a fucking lamp switch? Well, way more eye-darkening here! I'm starting to think they're all closeted vampires.\nDamon Salvator, c'mon down, my sexy friend!The dialogue was so choppy and the writing itself is simple to read, yet amateur and not good at all. Complete pain in the ass.Wrap-upI hated this book with a burning, fiery passion. It angered me and I hope that no girl actually admires Cassidy's cheating behavior and misogynistic ways."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth (Liz)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5495317-elizabeth-liz", "userReview": "Review posted at: Swept Away By RomanceGenre: New AdultHeat Level: Moderately SteamyAngst Level: Angsty, but not OTT (nothing which will require you to seek a support group)Crazy-Dayzzz Drama Level: Nothing OTT Possible Issues For Peeps: Some discussion of abuse5 StarsA star was born with Taking Chances--one of my favorite books of 2012--and, with the release of From Ashes, Molly McAdams continues to shine so very, VERY bright!! Cassidy Jameson escapes a wretched, abusive existence in California with her life-long best friend Tyler by her side when he literally packs her up and moves her with him to college in Texas. They share a bond that most don't understand and many mistake for something more than friendship. Tyler and her deceased father are the only two people Cassidy has put her trust in for the majority of her life. She has absolutely no one else in her life, because she has never allowed anyone other than Tyler into her reality. Cassidy depends thoroughly and completely on Tyler to meet the few emotional needs she has and to be her sole support system. When they arrive in Austin, TX, Cassidy immediately meets their new roommate, Tyler's cousin, Gage Carson. From the first meeting Cassidy and Gage are inexplicably and strongly drawn to one another. To Gage, Cassidy is the most beautiful girl he has ever seen. She is quiet and kind, a phenomenal cook, wise beyond her years, a survivor, and he knows she carries a great deal of pain. To Cassidy, Gage is the single best looking guy she's ever met. He's equal parts city and country, has a drawl to die for, is a true gentleman, and has an amazing family. Neither understands the strength of the attraction between them. Gage has never experienced this immediate, imperative need to protect a girl, to make her his in every way. Because of her background, Cassidy does not trust easily or quickly, nor has she ever felt quite this kind of pull toward a man. Due to manipulation by Tyler, both Cassidy and Gage dance around their feelings for one another for a year and a half, both taking somewhat drastic measures to try and forget one another. However, the day finally comes when Tyler drives Cassidy straight into the arms of Gage, and both Cassidy and Gage decide they are finally ready to take a chance on being together. But, Cassidy still has a past to face and demons to fight. Are any of them strong enough to withstand the fallout? Is the love Gage and Cassidy have for each other enough to carry them through?My God, does Molly McAdams know how to tell a story! From Ashes so completely and totally sucked me in, that I literally read it front to back, through the night, WITHOUT STOPPING!! This is the second book from this author, and the second book of hers that I've read in one sitting. There is something about the way she tells a story, writes a character. I literally have yet to be able to put one of her books down without finishing it! Molly's stories are compelling, emotional, sexy, exciting, fun and twisty. From Ashes is *exactly* that, in every way. I had such high hopes for this book, and she exceeded them. I became so utterly involved with and absorbed by the story and the characters, even when I found them thoroughly annoying and wanted to smack each of them upside the head!!! I simply could not put this book down until I knew how it ended. I dare you to try!Speaking of the ending, the epilogue is FABULOUS! I love a good epilogue, I admit it. And, I've been known to pitch a fit when A) there isn't ANY epilogue and/or B) the epilogue is less than stellar. Let me assure you, at about four this morning, I was doing the most obnoxious happy dance you would NEVER want to see! My cats eyed me with complete disdain;) But, that's just how much I LOVED this epilogue!A note to those who have read Taking Chances and were completely traumatized by a certain event in that story, I'm personally giving you the all-clear for From Ashes;) You may shed some tears, because, frankly, Molly's just that good, but you will NOT need therapy after this book:)Now, for my personal plea to Molly McAdams. When you read From Ashes--and YOU BETTER READ IT!--you will meet a character by the name of Detective Connor Green. If you are anything like me, you will join me in begging Molly McAdams for the following: PLEASE, PLEASE GIVE CONNOR GREEN A STORY...PRETTY PLEASE?!?!I <3 you, Molly McAdams.

I know I said I wouldn't review it but I can't help myself. The following is only one out of the many things that bothered me though, so this'll be short. What the hell is it with McAdams and time frames? She basically DOES NOT USE THEM. It jumps from a week, to 8 months with no warning, and you're left going WTF? She really needs to work on this issue before she writes more books. There were times in the book when it jumped from one day, to 3 weeks later and it wasn't clear until halfway through the chapter. It's annoying as heck and it made me want to scream.EDIT 12/12/12: I know I said I wasn't going to write a review, but I honestly feel that I can explain this book to you in ten simple steps. Ready for it?Step 1) Innocent virgin leaves an unhappy homeStep 2) Innocent virgin meets hot bad boy Step 3) Insta-loveStep 4) Something gets in the way of their being together, Step 5) They struggle with the obstacle, but eventually their \"love\" overcomes itStep 5) They get together *insert gasp here 'cause it's totally supposed to be this big exciting thing, right?*Step 6) Innocent virgin turns into raging sexaholicStep 7) Someone dies or gets pregnant, or maybe even bothStep 8) There is either extreme grief or happiness depending on which route the author took for step 7Step 9) Another stupid obstacle that they overcome with their \"love\"Step 10) They all live happily ever after.The best part about this wonderful little formula? It seems to apply to a large amount of the New Adult books being published! Isn't that just great?I hated this book. I hated it even more than Taking Chances.

Sweet story, but wasn't entirely blown away...While I was intrigued by the premise of this story, I felt there were moments where its execution fell flat. Although From Ashes deals significantly with physical abuse, its plot largely focuses on an intense roller coaster romance, and damaged but redeemable relationships.\u00a0Cassidy and Tyler have been best friends since childhood. Tyler is Cassi's rock; protecting and consoling her for as long as she can remember. When they finally decide to flee their childhood town in search of a new beginning, its Tyler's cousin Gage who they end up sharing an apartment with.\u00a0Gage Carson\u2014you sexily and single handedly saved this book for me! Gage is fictional hero perfection at its best. Sexy and sweet, but intense and protective, as well. When Gage and Cassi first meet, their immediate attraction towards one another is electric. Normally, I like a little more build-up before characters become smitten, but it seemed to have worked here perfectly. The alternating POV's between Gage and Cassi added an intriguing depth to their relationship. \u00a0While this story was interesting and held my attention pretty securely, there were elements that frustrated me to no end\u2014namely, the colossal misunderstanding stemming from a total lack of communication between characters! I understand that this was factored in to ignite tension within the story, but it was dragged out to the point of frustration.\u00a0I would have preferred the addiction of more substantial hurdles rather than prolonging the same few that didn't seem to hold much weight to begin with.\u00a0There were also some over-the-top events that I felt came out of nowhere, (especially towards the end) and sort of hindered the story's believability. I love angst, but not when it's paired with oblivious characters\u2014and there were many instances where the characters were either in complete denial, or just entirely missing the obviousness of the situation at hand.All of that being said, this story did have an interesting cast of characters and there were various tender and touching moments. Gage and Cassi had a beautiful connection. Despite my conflicting emotions, I can see why many have adored this story. I wanted to love it, but it unfortunately just didn't happen for me.\n\nBook Stats:\n\u25aa\t Genre/Category: Romance/NA\u25aa\t Steam Caliber: Moderate\u25aa Romance: Complex.

Secretly, I was hoping that after a short break, I would actually like it. NO, I still did not like it even after it had a nice ending. That is why I am giving it a star. It deserves something because it had a nice ending and I did like Gage. Other then that, my views have not changed. Had to recover from that 1 1/2 years of misunderstanding to a bunch of other silly misunderstandings. People don't you talk??? After being friends and have feeling for each other for 1 1/2 years, don't you think you should respect each other enough to ask \"hey, are you mad at me?\" OR \"Hey, we had a nice day together, why are you telling people you don't want me here or that you are tolerating me?\" I can understand being \"shy\" about asking those questions when the friendship is new (or you are 12), but we are talking over a year of this! And then the other stuff, I do not want to even go there. Please!! Gage is a nice guy, really, you are going to go and do that????? UGH!Earlier review when I called it a DNF.12/10/12 - This one is a DNF for me. Maybe I will pick it up later in time since I did pay $2.99 for it. I hate when my money goes to waste. And FYI, I was looking forward to reading it. Started it the day it was delivered to my Kindle (pre-ordered). I just don't pre-order anything.Bottom line, I could not handle all the \"misunderstandings.\" I am calling it that since I do not want to give anything away. Let me know just say that the first few percentages, I thought the writing was great. I thought that all the \"misunderstandings\" would be over in a few pages. People would put 2 and 2 together and we would move one to more interesting stuff. But no, that \"misunderstanding\" just would not end. And then there was other \"stuff\" that I just don't find interesting in a book. I love YA books, I love YA drama :) but a good book may have a \"misunderstanding\" here and there, but we get passed it after dealing with it for 5% of the book. At 44%, where I stopped, I was ready to throw in the towel with the \"shot me now\" feeling. Yep, that is when I call it a day and a DNF on Bookshelf/Tag.11/29/12- Yep, it is official, I am a glutton for punishment because I just pre-ordered this book on Amazon. If my heart is broken, my stomach is turned and I need therapy, I am calling you Molly McAdams. Why oh why do I do this to myself?????11/26/12 - I saw this cover and noticed how similar it is to Taking Chances (also by Molly McAdams) except the three are standing not sitting and thought 'please not again.' I hope this one leaves me happy because I am still mourning after reading Taking Chances. I may need to wait and see what reviews are before I pick this one up.

I have no problem with the first half. I thought the love story was sweet and really rooted for Gage and Cassidy. I got to the halfway mark and realized that this book is very similar to the energizer bunny. It just keeps going and going and going. By the time I read 51% of this book I literally could not understand why the story kept going. The antagonists change their tune, so the author brings in new antagonists. The couple figures out that they have a communication problem and then continue not communicating! Not to harp on this point, but it\u2019s as if this book consists of the first, second and the third book in a trilogy.This book is melodramatic. I don\u2019t mean, because Cassidy was abused as a child or because the main characters are absolutely horrible at communication. This book is melodramatic, because of the dialogue, because the characters are ridiculously unrealistic and because too much happens. Honestly, more happens to these characters in a yearlong period than in the lifespan of a normal person. Halfway into the book the author introduces a new character that comes with his own set of drama. Then 75% in a new love interest is thrown in to shake things up. Why? I honestly don\u2019t understand why these characters were introduced. How is the reader supposed to be invested or even care about these new characters? They came 75% in, obviously they\u2019re not important, now you\u2019re just making us suffer through your ridiculous story. I say suffer, because very few people will quit a book after reading 75% of it. Then there are the characters. I understand why authors make their heroine\u2019s damaged and tragic. Some of my favorite characters in literature are damaged. No, I do not mind a damaged heroine; I do mind a stupid heroine. Cassidy is stupid. I get that she\u2019s had a traumatic past and has issues with trust, getting to know people and taking care of herself. That is all clear, still I found her to be incredibly stupid. The first half of this book consists of misdirection and miscommunication. There were moments where Cassidy\u2019s inability to read a situation astounded me. I could not believe how difficult it was for her to see that she was being manipulated and lied to. Having common sense really can save you grief in life and Cassidy has none of it.Then there is Tyler. Ty is an affront to best friends everywhere. At this moment there is a BFF giving their friend half of their dinner, because they know their friend doesn\u2019t have any. There is a BFF asking their parents if their abused friend can stay the night so that their friend can have a night of peace. It goes on and on. The fact that Ty could go from that BFF to the bastard he became is beyond my comprehension. It is fine that he loves Cassidy. It is fine that he wants to continue to be the number one man in her life. Everything else about this character is awful and I have to admit unrealistic. He emotionally blackmails, manipulates and abuses not only the girl he has spent his life tending, but also the cousin who takes him in. Worst of all, this side of him comes out of nowhere.Finally, the love story. Gage and Cassidy see each other and are immediately in love. I don\u2019t really believe in love at first sight, but many authors have been able to make this work. The problem is not how easily they fall in love. The problem is how quickly both characters begin planning forever, before they even speak to each other. I found all the inner thoughts of Gage to be unrealistic. McAdams really needed to talk to a few guy friends about their thought process. Gage thinks like a woman and I have enough guy best friends to understand that they do not think the way that I do. When Gage and Cassidy finally get together, there is no growth process. They do not take time to blend as a couple. They just begin thinking about marriage and babies, etc.Cassidy before the epilogue is 19 years old. She is not in school and she works at starbucks. There is nothing wrong with working at starbucks, but this is a girl without a dream, ambition or any plans for the future. She is finally free of her abusive family and it never occurs to her to make a plan? She doesn\u2019t save up money to go to school, start a business, or anything. I\u2019m not even sure that she graduated from high school. There is not even a mention on whether or not Cassidy sees her future as a stay at home mother. Everyone is different. I literally wouldn\u2019t care what her plan was, as long as she had a plan. Nope, she gets away from her abusive life, focuses on guys and that\u2019s it.This is a story without any depth. It\u2019s almost offensive that McAdams thinks that because she wrote a victim of abuse, she added some dimension. No. Victims of abuse still have dreams, they have hopes, and they want more from their lives. Sometimes they are damaged and never recover, but Cassidy doesn\u2019t have the issue of drugs, alcohol or any of the other vices people use to cope. McAdams wrote a character that absolutely could have built a life for herself, but instead the author chose to write a woman who cannot cope without a man.A love story should have romance and two people who cannot live without each other. Still, a healthy love has two independent people who have lives outside of each other."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9916227-jennifer-kyle", "userReview": "3 Stars\"Through these ashes, I pray you're able to find peace, knowing that your nightmare is now over.\" \nI was a little leary about starting this book after the heartbreak I experienced with Taking Chances.

I have to go with three. I didn't dislike the book, but I didn't love it either. I haven't read Molly McAdams' other book, Taking Chances, as I found out, by accident, what happened and it took some of the appeal away. But I do know that it was a book that seemed to cause extreme reactions. It seemed like Marmite, people either absolutely adored it, despite the turmoil, or hated it with a vengeance. So I know, when From Ashes came out, I had to read it to see what all of the fuss was about.It's true. Molly McAdams is a fantastic writer. The characters are well developed, the scenes are life like and the writing itself was addictive... but the characters drove me completely insane.It was, very distinctly, a book of two halves for me. Or more like 60/40, actually. The first 60% was, quite honestly, one of the most frustrating pieces of reading I've ever come across. It seems in the world of From Ashes, communication is a foreign language and assumption is an every day occurrence. The misunderstandings were just ridiculous at times, not to mention the over reactions on Cassidy's part.Speaking of Cassidy... urgh! I've never wanted to slap someone hard between the eyes as much as I did her. I get that was supposed to be a tortured soul, but honestly? Sometimes she was beyond stupid and just a total bitch. I did grow to like her more by the end, but she just infuriated me so much in the beginning, that it was too much for her to entirely redeem herself.And then there was Tyler. Cassidy's supposed life long best friend. I didn't get him at all! He was one of the things that was so obviously different in the two parts of this book. He was a complete dickhead throughout the first half and in my opinion, his behaviour was completely unforgivable and didn't correspond with the guy that Cassidy seemed to depend upon so heavily. And then at around 60% he changed unrecognisably and became this sweet, dependable BFF... I had real trouble making the connection between the two sides of Tyler.\n\n\"It's complicated; we really were just friends. But she needed me; I couldn't just leave her. And I'm in love with her, man.\"\n\nFor me, Gage saved the book. He was to die for. I felt so sorry for him at so many points in the book. There's no way Cassidy deserved him, I don't care how pretty her golden eyes are! He didn't put a foot wrong. He was caring, considerate, protective, devoted, mature... just gorgeous. I think his Dad should had given him a kick up the ass and told him to get over this messer of a girl, rather than encouraged him!\n\"The first night I met her, I felt her before I even saw her. It's like I had to look up at her, and when I did... I swear the world stopped moving.\"\nSo, there we go. I really enjoyed the last 40% of the book, even with the complication of Detective Connor Green (who I couldn't decide whether I loved or hated) which I think gave this book the juice it was missing, the juice that the author seemed to try and include by writing annoying miscommunication and inconsistent personalities. At least Cassidy seemed to grow some balls in the latter section of the book, and Tyler sorted his shit out. Gage, true to form, stayed as perfect as ever. *sigh*To read more reviews go to my Book Blog: http://smittensbookblog.wordpress.com/Follow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/SmittenSCFind me on Pinterest: http://pinterest.com/smittensc/Join in the chat on Facebook: http://www.facebook.com/groups/427743..."}, {"userName": "Marina", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13500406-marina", "userReview": "Just a few words on this one.It was a DNF for me.

No esperaba nada de \u00e9l, solo algo que al menos me entretuviera y fuera una bonita historia de amor, pero lo que me encontr\u00e9 fue una historia que pasaba tan r\u00e1pido que literalmente no me daba cuenta de cu\u00e1ndo hab\u00edan pasado los meses, y los protagonistas ya sab\u00edan que eran el amor de sus vidas y NO. Una vez superado eso, hab\u00edan demasiados obst\u00e1culos que les imped\u00edan estar juntos y algunos eran tan WTF, que quer\u00eda tirar el libro. Con lo f\u00e1cil que es coger a la persona y HABLAR con ella para ahorrarse todo el drama. RESE\u00d1A COMPLETA: No sab\u00eda que esperarme de esta novela en cuanto empec\u00e9 a leerla, pero esperaba algo que fuera entretenido y r\u00e1pido de leer, como lo son las novelas new adult, pero lamentablemente no fue lo que yo esperaba y por algunas razones, que explicar\u00e9 a continuaci\u00f3n no pude conectar ni con la novela, ni con los personajes, ni con la historia que cuenta Molly McAdams. De las cenizas tiene un inicio de infarto, eso no lo voy a negar. Qued\u00e9 impresionada desde las primeras p\u00e1ginas, pero desgraciadamente una vez que la historia cogi\u00f3 ritmo, para mi fue decayendo. Cassidy es una chica que ha tenido una vida muy dif\u00edcil, y su \u00fanica salvaci\u00f3n fue Tyler, su mejor amigo desde que ten\u00edan seis a\u00f1os, \u00e9l fue siempre la roca que la manten\u00eda a flote, y consegu\u00eda que saliera adelante pese a todas las duras situaciones por las que tuvo que pasar. Desde que perdi\u00f3 a su padre a los seis a\u00f1os, para Cassidy nada volvi\u00f3 a ser igual. La novela empieza cuando nuestra protagonista est\u00e1 a punto de cumplir los dieciocho a\u00f1os y junto a Tyler se mudan a Texas, pero lo que Cassidy no sab\u00eda era que ah\u00ed encontrar\u00eda al primero de su mejor amigo, y se sentir\u00eda atra\u00edda por \u00e9l desde el primer momento. Pese a que la sinopsis ten\u00eda algunos clich\u00e9s que no me acababan de gustar, pens\u00e9 que con el desarrollo de los personajes y la historia no me importar\u00eda tanto, pero no he podido conectar con ninguno de ellos. Contado bajo dos puntos de vista, conocemos tanto a Cassidy como a Gage, y aunque me gust\u00f3 mucho que la autora incluyera dos puntos de vista, no me gustaron ninguno de los dos. Entiendo que Cassidy tuviera una vida dura, muy dura, y que debido a ello no le resultaba f\u00e1cil abrirse a los dem\u00e1s, porque el \u00fanico que la entend\u00eda era Tyler, pero en muchas ocasiones me frustraba las decisiones que tomaba, y la manera en la que lo hac\u00eda.Es un libro de m\u00e1s de trescientas p\u00e1ginas que bajo mi punto de vista no tendr\u00edan que ser tantas, porque sent\u00eda que la autora segu\u00eda estirando una historia que pod\u00eda tener un punto y final con muchas menos p\u00e1ginas y debido a ello inclu\u00eda m\u00e1s y m\u00e1s obst\u00e1culos que les imped\u00eda estar juntos a los protagonistas, y en muchos casos esos obst\u00e1culos se arreglar\u00edan simplemente si los personajes hablaran, y por ello mismo no me gustaron. Tanto Gage como Cassidy podr\u00edan haberse ahorrado muchos problemas si hubiesen dejado de imaginarse situaciones que no pasaban. Otro hecho que tampoco me gust\u00f3 fue que la autora quer\u00eda escribir una novela que avanzara muy r\u00e1pido, es decir, desde que se inicia la historia hasta que casi acaba pasan dos a\u00f1os, y en muchas ocasiones no me daba cuenta de que hab\u00edan pasado meses, porque acababa de leer un cap\u00edtulo, y saltaba a otra cosa, y me quedaba desconcertada porque no sab\u00eda qu\u00e9 hab\u00eda pasado. Entiendo que Molly McAdams con ello quer\u00eda hacernos ver que no era una historia que transcurriera en meses, sino en a\u00f1os, porque desde que se inicia el libro hasta que casi termina pasan m\u00e1s de dos a\u00f1os llenos de obst\u00e1culos y problemas. Debido a esta precipitaci\u00f3n de la autora, sent\u00ed que los protagonistas ya estaban enamorados y no pude ver un proceso de ese enamoramiento, simplemente se sab\u00eda que ya no pod\u00edan vivir el uno sin el otro, y no me gustaba verlo desarrollado as\u00ed. Por el otro lado, bajo mi punto de vista hab\u00eda demasiado drama que realmente era innecesario. Entiendo que en las novelas rom\u00e1nticas es normal que haya un bache que les impida estar juntos pero es que en esta historia hay demasiados y no resultaba natural, ni tampoco real. Como la historia avanzaba tan r\u00e1pido, pens\u00e9 que al menos los personajes tendr\u00edan un desarrollo pero realmente despu\u00e9s de acabar la novela creo que se quedaron igual que al principio porque yo segu\u00eda sin ver ning\u00fan cambio en ellos, me resultaron bastante planos la verdad y lleno de t\u00f3picos.De verdad que yo quer\u00eda que me gustara la novela, porque este g\u00e9nero me gusta much\u00edsimo, y entiendo que es necesario que hayan dramas, y discusiones y reconciliaciones pero la verdad es que en De las cenizas no me parecieron reales, y resultaban muy cargantes que en menos de 200 p\u00e1ginas ya se hubiera pasado por todas las fases del enamoramiento y que los personajes supieran que quieren estar juntos para siempre. Adem\u00e1s de la rapidez de la novela, hubo una cierta situaci\u00f3n que me dej\u00f3 muy desconcertada casi al final del libro, porque parec\u00eda que la autora quer\u00eda darle la vuelta a la tortilla introduciendo a un nuevo personaje, que sinceramente no entiendo qu\u00e9 pretend\u00eda con \u00e9l. DE LAS CENIZAS de MOLLY MCADAMS fue una novela de la que no me esperaba nada, pero sin embargo fue una peque\u00f1a decepci\u00f3n, porque no he podido conectar ni con los personajes, ni tampoco con la historia que bajo mi punto de vista ten\u00eda demasiados elementos dram\u00e1ticos, al igual que tampoco me gust\u00f3 la rapidez con la que se iban desarrollando los sentimientos entre Cassidy y Gage. Pero tambi\u00e9n os digo que si os llama la atenci\u00f3n, que la le\u00e1is ya que en Goodreads tiene muy buena puntuaci\u00f3n, pero lamentablemente no ha sido una novela que yo haya disfrutado."}, {"userName": "Ashleigh", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10707481-ashleigh", "userReview": "I really thought I would love this book, but sometimes it just does not happen.

I read Taking Chances and although it was very well written, the heroine annoyed me and I hated the ending. Unfortunately for this book, not only did the heroine annoy me, so did every other freaking person involved. Apart from Gage, he was the only saving Grace in this book.I can't go in to too much detail because I will end up getting worked up over the book again, so I'll just explain my issues.Issue 1.The fact that Cassidy was apparently a walking Goddess. For a girl who has never been around any boys in her 'previous life', they sure as hell fall to their knees infront of her and she loves nothing more than falling for them too. Literally every male that seemed to come in to contact with Cassidy seemed to lose all sense and reasoning and just fell in love with her. It was crazy. This exact thing happened in Taking Chances. It's just so not believable for me. They (Harper and Cassidy) are meant to be this naive, virgin, young (mentally, really) girls who have barely experienced boys. Yet here they are playing off all the boys they come in to contact with. For Cassidy there was Tyler, Gage, Connor, even some of Tyler and Gage's friends seemed to love her. I didn't get it.Issue 2.COMMUNICATION. Seriously. I read a lot of books and yes, some of them have a lack of communication. But never in my life have I ever read a book where communicating with each other is literally unheard of. I know it wouldn't have made much of a book if they had talked, but seriously going nearly 18 months or whatever not knowing the relationship of the two people you (Gage) are living with is absurd. How would you not just outright ask them? And Cassidy too, she wanted to know what Gage really felt about her, but instead just let him go, without saying a word! Ugh. Really, nobody would talk to each other and it drove me INSANE.Issue 3.The friendship between Cassidy and Tyler. It really, really made me uncomfortable. I understand they were best friends for a LONG time but the way they were so overly touchy feely with each other was just really odd to be. They shared a bed, pretty much acted like a couple, minus the sex, but were strictly best friends? It was just odd. And realy, Cassidy asked for half the trouble she went through because of this supposed friendship. She had some double standards.I really can't rate this anymore than a 3 star. I didn't really enjoy reading it. I love a bit of angst in my books but this was too much. I literally got a headache from reading this because there was SO much happening that was just ridiculous. Kudos to Molly for pulling these emotions out of her readers (and I know a lot of people felt the same) but for me it was just too much."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3283298-jessica", "userReview": "Stopping at 58%.

Her life started out as the apple of her parents eye, the princess who never went without... and then, on her sixth birthday, that changes completely with the death of her father. Her mother... let\u2019s just say she takes a flying leap off the deep end. And Cassi pays the price. Having spent the last twelve years of her life suffering constant abuse, Cassi is quiet and reserved. Down trodden and afraid. But she still has spirit and she\u2019s trying to move on with her life. Which is how she ends up moving from California to Texas with her best friend, Tyler. And how she meets Gage Carson, Tyler\u2019s cousin.Gage Carson is consumed by Cassi from the moment she steps out of his cousin\u2019s truck. And is also warned to back off just as quickly. Cassi is Tyler\u2019s girl, or so Gage is told. But it doesn\u2019t stop him from wanting her. And it doesn\u2019t stop him from trying to protect her and be Cassi\u2019s knight in shining armor. Because, truthfully, someone needs to watch out for her. And while Tyler might have been her saving grace for the last twelve years, he\u2019s also perpetuates the problem and doesn\u2019t let her grow. And he\u2019s also manipulative and a total liar. A... crafty little spider, spinning constant webs of lies. I enjoyed the evolution of Cassi and Gage\u2019s relationship. The progress they make throughout. Seeing every step forward and back, seeing their friendship and romance from beginning to end. I like being there for it all. And Miz McAdams did a wonderful job engaging my emotions. Making me care for Cassi and for Gage. (And completely NOT care for Tyler.) I like that she gave Cassi real issues and made her struggle to overcome them and, essentially, herself. And Gage was a very understanding and supportive partner. I was rooting for them the entire time.From Ashes has a frenzy of emotions and turmoil and passion within its pages. It is full of characters that are dealing with serious matters and have a lot to overcome. If you love a story with a heroine who starts out broken and pieces herself together, a hero who will fight for her\u2014even if it means he\u2019s fighting himself, and a plot that is dramatic as well as tragic, then From Ashes is definitely for you.\nFavorite Quote: \n She nodded against me. \u201cDo you need me to do anything?\u201d I didn\u2019t need a thing from her, but I wanted everything.

It just didn't feel like those kinds of character swings were believable. I also don't really understand why Connor was even in the book. He didn't really seem to serve any real purpose. I also felt like it kind is dragged in the end. I could have happily skipped the whole epilogue (which is shocking because I'm kind of an epilogue junky ) So this was ok, but nothing that will be on my re read shelf."}, {"userName": "Holly Noelle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4189131-holly-noelle", "userReview": "[ the cheating. Cassie straight up cheated on her boyfriend. How is that sexy? How did that help the story? It made her an asshole! She just kissed him? She had an emotional affair. What's more, his family supports HER throughout this whole thing. Even though she leaves because of her black eye, which was the result of a legitimate accident (Anyone saying otherwise is an idiot), his family rallies behind her.

I've never read Molly McAdams other book Taking Chances but I read a lot about it. I honestly wasn't sure what to expect when I started this book. But man am I glad I gave this book a chance!Cassidy is finally free. After almost twelve years of being abused and feeling like she'll never have a future, Tyler takes her with him to Texas. But just because she's finally away from California doesn't mean that her past doesn't haunt her. I really liked Cassidy. I can't even begin to understand how she could have dealt with the life she was handed and it's insane how she came out of that normal. Well beyond normal honestly. She's the sweetest girl and despite always being surrounded by violence, couldn't even hurt a fly. I found it slightly annoying how every guy that came in contact with her found her insanely attractive and wanted to be with her. But honestly, it stopped bothering me really quickly.The only problem with her for me was the fact that I had love/hate relationship with some of her personality traits. Mainly her need to depend on someone. But considering her past it makes sense. Still I wish she would've learned to depends on herself more. It also pissed me off that her first instinct is to run away when things get bad. But this book is a journey for Cassidy and we really get to see her grow, make mistakes a lot granted, but she definitely changes a lot since the beginning. Tyler, the best friend. Hmm I'm still not sure how I feel about him. Throughout most of the book I really wished he would disappear. He purposely ruined everything and I couldn't even understand how someone who swears loves Cassidy could do those things to her. He thinks he has this claim over her and frankly it's kind of unhealthy. As the book progresses it gets worse to the point where he was manipulating her. A lot happens in this book and Tyler does a change eventually but honestly I still don't really like him.Gage is hands down one of my favorite fictional men ever!! From the moment he meets Cassidy, she is it for him. He's sweet, funny, handsome as hell and even a bit possessive (but not to any crazy extents). I feel really bad for him a lot throughout the book because it seems he's always getting his heart broken. He does make some mistakes though too but it's just blown out of proportions as these things do when outside people get in your business. I also really loved Gage's family as well as their circle of friends. Everyone is really nice. The book wraps up wonderfully and even though I feel like Gage and Cassidy's story is over I was left wondering about some other people. Mainly Amanda (Gage's sister) and Jesse (Cassidy's friend). Nothing was said about them so I'm hoping and wishing that Amanda and Jesse get their own story. To everyone who isn't sure if they should read this: Read. It. I don't know how Taking Chances was but this book will blow your minds in the best possible way and leave you feeling giddy and content all at the same time. I can't wait to see what this author thinks of next!*Received from Edelweiss and William Morrow Paperbacks in exchange for an honest review.**This review also appears on my blog Anna's Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Christan Stevens", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11307123-christan-stevens", "userReview": "From the spoilers, I can already tell this will be my second favorite book. Molly is genius and I can't wait for the release in December. I'm already on Team Gage!! :)What an amazing read! This book had me stressing about life and love and all around happiness. Molly, once again, has filled my heart with joy and sadness. At first, I HATED Tyler! He was selfish and possessive and I just didn't like him. Gage was sweet, and the love and admiration he had toward Cassidy was amazing! From Ashes was such a symbolic title. Cassidy's life before Texas was a living Hell but she met Gage and he was her saving grace. From the moment they both laid eyes on each other, Gage and Cassidy knew they felt something they had never felt with anyone else. But Tyler did everything in his power to keep them from knowing their true feelings for each other. Tyler was such a douche bag and little did he know, instead of protecting Cass from Gage, he was only hurting her more. But then Tyler realized that what he had with Cassidy was only the best friendship anyone could ask for and that Cassidy would never love him the way he wanted her to; she was in love with Gage. After tragedy strikes Cassidy once again, she flees from Gage, back to Tyler, without any reason but a note that says she had to go. Going back to California to that living Hell was not easy for Cassidy but it was a must and she came out of the situation with a new outlook on the demons that killed her past. Cassidy and Gage end up together with the happiest ending I've ever read in such a tragic book. Please buy and read From Ashes. You won't regret it. From Ashes is filled with many broken hearts and so many more great memories. This book is fantastic!!
