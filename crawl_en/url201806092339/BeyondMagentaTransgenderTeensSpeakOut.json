Yes, transgender issues need to be talked about more. Awareness and understanding need to be fostered. Yes, it's great to have a book that shows exactly the struggles transgender teens face in day-to-day life.However.The scope of this book is extremely narrow. Out of six narratives, five of them are from NYC and the surrounding areas - the last teen, Luke, lives in Madison, WI. I almost stopped reading after the first two narratives because Jessy would say stuff like he knew he was a boy because he liked sports, and Christina would say she knew she was a girl because she liked wearing pretty things. I have absolutely no doubt that that is truly how they feel and felt, but this speaks to a gender division that I can't understand. I wonder why Kuklin chose to start the narratives with these two. For me, they were off-putting. Would the general public find them to be so, or would they find them more comforting because they speak to society's views of what is male and what is female?Nat's and especially Cameron's stories spoke to me on a deeper level and assuaged my fears that Beyond Magenta was just going to adhere to terrifying gender stereotypes. Both Nat and Cameron identify as intersex or nonbinary, and prefer gender neutral \"they/them/theirs\" pronouns. Where Cameron's identity fluctuates on a daily basis - some days they are more feminine while other days they are more masculine - Nat prefers to present as neither gender.I would like to stress that my rating is based mostly on the poor formatting of the book, not on these teens' narratives themselves. Only interviewing six people, most of whom live in one fairly diverse city, and grouping the narratives in a strange way made for bad editing choices. I could find more diverse stories and gender identities browsing Tumblr for half an hour than I found in this 192-page book."}, {"userName": "Florian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7799840-florian", "userReview": "The idea of this book is fantastic: allowing young trans people from many different backgrounds to tell their own stories, which would then be collected and published, allowing the wider world to read about a variety of trans possibilities and experiences. The actuality of the book was incredibly disappointing. The most positive thing about Beyond Magenta is that it does strive to include the diversity of the trans community as reflected in the identities of the interviewees. There is an equal representation of two trans feminine people, two trans masculine people, and two nonbinary people. Likewise, at least half of the interviewees are people of color, and all six come from different socioeconomic and familial backgrounds.This initial diversity is stiffed by the narrow intent of the author. It is clear that this book was written about trans teens, but it was absolutely not written for trans teens. This has more to do with the author than it does with the young people interviewed. As Kuklin states in the Author's Note, she began writing thinking that \"The book was going to be about boys who realized they are girls and girls who realized they are boys. As you can see, this vision changed as I learned more.\" She did not learn enough to realize that she was framing her book in the way that many cis (for those who don't know, cis, or cisgender is a term that denotes a person who identifies with the gender they were assigned at birth.) people frame transness: as a before and after curiosity that is most intensely focused on transition and coming out. It is clear that the author asked questions about transitioning, coming out, acceptance by peers, etc. All those hot button curiosities that turn trans narratives into soap operas about fixing our bodies and overcoming tragedy. I am not surprised that the people giving this book 5 star ratings exclaim that they \"Learned so much!\" and it \"opened their minds!\" This book is written by a cis author, and appeals to a cis audience. It focuses on bodies, hormones, and battles for acceptance rather than the emotional growth of coming to terms with your trans identity, or the other facets of the lives of the interviewees. Overall, I feel that Kuklin simultaneously was too present in guiding the content included in the book and too absent in the process of supplementing the stories included with perspectives that would broaden the ideas of gender presented. The very back of the book includes an interview with a healthcare professional about very basic ideas of transness, and I feel the inclusion of more brief interviews with trans adults and trans activist leaders could have given Beyond Magenta some much needed political perspective.If this is the first book on trans issues you are reading, it may serve as a very basic trans and gender 101. The trans people interviewed deserved a better platform for telling their stories than this author provided."}, {"userName": "Romie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33510193-romie", "userReview": "Dnfed it 24 pages in, because COME ON SERIOUSLY ?!Let me explain a bit more:I\u2019m having a real problem with Jessy.

It would have been nice to see what kinds of questions teens were responding to, in order to have a sense of how Kuklin may have shaped the information given. The stories teens told were interesting and sad and funny, they spoke about how they view gender, what their childhoods were like, etc That said, this collection feels like a Dick and Jane version of a book like Gender Outlaws, mainly because of Kulin's limited scope and oversimplification of ideas. There are only 6 subjects interviewed, all living in a relatively small geographical area and given how young they are there isn't much perspective on their own stories since they're still immersed in them. In her afterword, Kuklin explains that she initially planned to write a book on 'boys who realize that they are girls and girls who realize that they are boys', but realized this was an oversimplification after much research. Despite her apparent enlightenment, Kuklin doesn't show a broad understanding of what it means to be transgender. The fact that some teens expressed derision towards certain normative gender traits rankled me at first, until I thought about how young they are and how they're still figuring out who they are while stuck in the mire of social pressure. I don't expect an 18 year old to have it all figured out, but this book would have been so much improved by an author with a more complex understanding of gender and sexuality."}, {"userName": "Wart Hill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4621717-wart-hill", "userReview": "Read this and other reviews at Things I Find While ShelvingThere is one word I can use to describe this book: snapshots.This book is a series of snapshots of people on the Trans* spectrum.

I think the grouping put this book into more perspective. No, these six profiles of transgender, genderneutral, genderfluid, and intersex teens can't possibly capture every possible experience in the trans community, but I appreciated the attempt to start. In the same way Am I Blue only really grazes the surface, allowing the possibility of acceptable difference, this seems to be the heart of the message of these narratives and accompanying photos. (Actually the one essay lacking photos made the biggest statement to me!) It is a bit didactic but it is geared toward a younger audience, one that may need to be introduced to some of the terms and definitions that will not be familiar to everyone. (I know many adults who could benefit from reading this book, honestly.)I did love how it showed the journeys, how where a person thought they'd end up was not necessarily where they started. It showed the havoc in personal relationships and the perpetual intentional misunderstanding of the transgender community by people who should know better - teachers, principals, counselors. But it also showed that acceptance is possible, not just with the people surrounding an individual, but within that individual too. And for most of the teens in this book, that became the most important part (also early access to hormones. Thank you.)As far as the banned books debate, I am just constantly frustrated by the idea that telling a person's story is some kind of agenda. A struggling teen may find comfort in this book!

It consists of six stories about six transgender, genderqueer or gender nonconforming teens, accompanied by gorgeous, honest photographs and several comments by the author. The stories are told in first person by the teens themselves, interspersed here and there by the author\u2019s brief comments and observations. The first thing that will strike any reader is a complete absence of idealization. The teens are portrayed as they are, nothing is hidden, nothing embellished. They are people with convictions, fears, and sometimes inappropriate reactions, with lives a lot more challenging than those of cisgendered people. Kuklin did her very best to cover as much of the spectrum as she possibly could by including six very different shades of the gender spectrum. The kids categorize themselves, if they want to be categorized at all, and they tell their stories with such painful honesty and openness. Beyond Magenta is essentially a book \u201cabout sex and alienation, two universal themes that have interacted in life, literature and art since for ever.\u201d (Kuklin 2016: 164) As the author herself explains, initially she meant to write about teens whose true gender isn\u2019t what they were born with, i.e. girls who are really boys, and boys who are really girls. As her research progressed, however, she discovered so many different possibilities and made certain to represent them fairly. Some of these stories are light, as some of the teens live in encouraging, empowering environments. Others face more challenges, internal and external both. Each of the stories ends on a hopeful note, though, making sure that we have something to hold on to, even as we contemplate realities and challenges so very different from ours. I can only imagine what this book will mean to other transgender and genderqueer teens all around the world. Sometimes it\u2019s enough to know that you\u2019re not alone, that other people feel exactly like you. Beyond Magenta is a Stonewall honor book, a powerful and revelatory account of lives within the transgender community. In light of recent political events, such works of hope and encouragement might be essential to surviving whatever is coming and making it to the other side more tolerant and kind than we ever were."}, {"userName": "Jae", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10514132-jae", "userReview": "I just...ugh.

And I get that the whole point is teens telling their own stories but the way most of them talk about gender is so troubling, especially considering the clearly cis anticipated audience. Trans is not the next step down the (nonexistent) line from gay. And the glossary in the back was so bare bones and very off base in a lot of cases. I can't recommend this to anyone honestly.

Kuklin gathers together stories of different transgender teenagers at various stages in their coming out process and talks with them about their lives up until this point. It's heartbreaking to read about the challenges each individual has faced and see the hate and discrimination they deal with everyday. Yet at the same time, I found myself wanting to scream at some of the things the teens were saying about the world, gender, and just life in general. Overall, I just took a few deep breaths and remembered that I was a teenager once as well and I said some pretty silly things too.Definitely worth the read to gain perspective into what it's like to grow up in a body that feels wrong around people who don't understand.

However, this book only further served to put more false information into circulation and bolstered up some of the negative stereotypes that the transgender community has worked so hard to eradicate. Furthermore the stories in the book were poorly edited with typos and grammatical errors aplenty. And that's in addition to the perpetuation of terrible gender stereotypes (which you would imagine would be the exact opposite of the editor's intention!).

Beyond Magenta has become a target of book-banners, according to the ALA, who say it's anti-family, filled with offensive language and references to homosexuality, sneaky attempts to teach kids about sex, politics, and religion, and wrong for the age group at which it's aimed. Moreover, the ALA cites evidence that Beyond Magenta has prompted some school librarians to consider pre-emptive censorship (\u201cwants to remove from collection to ward off complaints\u201d).In a separate essay, the ALA zeroes in on books about diversity, noting that while only a tiny fraction of books written for American children and students are about people of color, LGBT people, and/or disabled people, these books almost always become the targets of angry parents who want them removed from classrooms and libraries. When books about diversity are challenged, diversity itself is almost never stated as a reason; instead, parents complain of sex ... and yet hundreds of other books written for children and students contain sex and are never challenged.While \u201cdiversity\u201d is seldom given as a reason for a challenge, it may in fact be an underlying and unspoken factor: the work is about people and issues others would prefer not to consider. Often, content addresses concerns of groups who have suffered historic and ongoing discrimination.To be sure, to be transgender (or gender fluid) is to diverge significantly from societal norms, and Beyond Magenta is most likely being attacked for exploring a kind of diversity many people find confrontational and uncomfortable.By encouraging six young transgender people to share their experiences with readers, I believe Susan Kuklin's intent is to inform and educate, and also to give other young transgender people the knowledge that they are not alone. In this she succeeds. If there is any sex in Beyond Magenta, it is only at the most abstract level: two or three of the transgendered kids she interviews mention sexual preferences, but none gp into detail. Sex is not what these kids are about. Gender is, and the book makes the difference clear.Offensive language? Nope. References to homosexuality? If a biological boy identifies as a girl, and (both before and after transitioning) is sexually attracted to boys, is that homosexual? Not in the same sense in which most of us think of homosexuality, surely. Sneaky sex education? Sex is mentioned, as noted, and I guess that's enough to send some folks into a tailspin. Political and religious indoctrination? None that I noticed. Wrong for the age group it's aimed at? The book is clearly meant to be read by transgender teens at a serious turning point in their lives, and how is that wrong?I suppose I should mention that of the six young people interviewed for this book, none have had sexual reassignment surgery. Each of them, however, takes hormone treatments to develop the secondary sexual characteristics of the gender they identify as.As I mentioned, I think one of Susan Kuklin's reasons for writing this book is to offer hope and encouragement to other transgender youth. Which is good, but ... she doesn't address the negative experiences so many transgender youth have to deal with: while a few of the young people featured in Beyond Magenta talked about teasing and resistance from parents, siblings, fellow students, and teachers, each of them managed to transition and move on; some even praised parents, peers, and schools for being supportive.What, I wondered, about transgender kids who don't live in socially progressive environments, who encounter non-stop suspicion, bullying, and hatred? None were interviewed in this book, and I thought Susan Kuklin's focus too limited. Her six interview subjects seem relatively privileged, judging by horror stories I've heard. And what of older transgender people? The oldest interviewee was maybe 18; all six were either starting, in the middle of, or just completing the process of transitioning. What happens when transgender teens reach adulthood and middle age? What are their lives like? What are their concerns? What are the downsides of transitioning? Equally, what are the upsides? These questions weren't addressed at all.Finally, I have to note some LGBT reviewers have panned Beyond Magenta. Several complained that the author is not a member of the LGBT community herself: \"Yet another book about trans people but not for us.\" Some complained about the language and labels she uses to express sexual and gender diversity: \"... much of the language used around transness was really out of date.\" A few reviewers called the book sensationalistic and voyeuristic, and said it reinforces stereotypes.None of their objections occurred to me. I'm not a member of the LGBT community either, so maybe that is to be expected. My sole objection is to the book's limited scope. I want to know more."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5906372-sarah", "userReview": "This multifaceted photo book about six transgender teenagers was truly enjoyable. Blending first person accounts with portrait photography (when the teens were comfortable with it), this book profiles several diverse trans teens. Included are teens of color, trans men, trans women, teens dealing with mental illness, and an intersex teen. One of the trans women, Mariah, is bisexual and another, Cameron (pictured on the cover) is pansexual and genderqueer.Kuklin explains in the afterward how the process of interviewing and photographing was handled, and each participant got to approve their chapter before publication. The end result is giving these teens the power to tell their own stories on their own terms. Several of them talk about conservative families and the struggle to be understood as transgender by hostile teachers and peers. Some rely primarily on photography, others on their interviews. Some are comfortable sharing their birth gender assignment and birth name, some are not. But each story is unique and feels real. As a teen services librarian in my day job, I\u2019ve worked with transgender teens and I can say that this book absolutely feels true to what I\u2019ve seen. If you\u2019re looking for a book of cookie-cutter role model kids who always use the perfect word choices, never internalize cisexism, and only follow the standard trans script, this book will not give that to you. They are young and sometimes make mistakes and mis-steps like anyone their age, but they are doing so with grace under fire from a cisexist and transphobic world. For trans teens who have not been lucky to have the support of parents or community this book will be invaluable and much-needed representation. And for anyone who says that teens are too young to know they are trans, pick up this book and educate yourself.

I'm very glad this type of book is out there, I'm just sorry I didn't enjoy reading it. I wanted a more diverse cross-section of voices - 5 kids from the East Coast and 1 from the Midwest - was too limiting for me to get a real feel for the experience or a deeper understanding of transgender identity. I also found that almost all of the teens were extremely damaged and had unstable or extreme home lives. There were only 2 \"well-adjusted\" teens portrayed (one whose story was limited due to family choice and the other whose story wreaked of white privilege and was grating to me) which, although I am not well-versed in trans culture, seemed to be quite negative and I would think, untrue. In addition, there was a bit too much negative gender stereotyping for my taste (portraying women as weak and too emotional, typifying masculinity as intelligence-based). Lastly, the writing style was so simplistic that while this was couched in terms of presenting the stories as interviews with little interference from the writer, it led to most of the voices coming across as inauthentic. One final note, there is a complete medical inaccuracy in one of the stories that irritated me. Poly-cystic ovarian syndrome or PCOS is explained thusly: during a fetus' development in the womb, it is unclear whether the fetus then has testes or ovaries.

And I felt like the intersex teen was out-of-place and could have been dealt with so much more deeply. I also would have liked to know more about the counseling received and what clinicians look for when counseling people on this journey."}, {"userName": "Alexa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6260491-alexa", "userReview": "This is beautifully photographed \u2013 one might be worried that such gorgeous photographs might only encourage prurient interest \u2013 but they\u2019re so engaging they just drew me right in \u2013 \u201cOh, I want to know more about that person!\u201d The lack of analysis and the simple storytelling just feels so right!

I was glad that it didn't just include MTF and FTM transitions but also a couple of teens who did not identify with either gender. There were some wildly different experiences, as well as a range of ages within the teen demographic. it was interesting that the author did not just pick teens who were at ease with themselves or done transitioning. I can imagine (though I don't know for certain) that it would of use and interesting to transitioning teens, as well as to everyone else, for this reason. As the teens' tell their stories, you get to hear about their self exploration and interests.The best part of the book, though, was probably how it was almost entirely in the teens' own words. Kuklin really only stuck a few lines here and there to tie it together, and that was important to both the readability and the integrity of the book. Instead of being some sort of primer on transgendered teens, it was more of simply 6 people's stories. And they were certainly well spoken teens!"}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10854693-brittany", "userReview": "I felt like I had the whole range of emotions while reading this book. I held my breath during Mariah's story, but I needed to hear it. The horrors and trauma in their tale taught me a lot about how children who are transitioning may think about themselves. Cameron's story made me smile and even my eyes smiled as I looked at their photos and saw the many aspects of their personality caught on film. Nat was fascinating and I loved their voice. They were witty, yet I felt like I was talking to a kid. It felt genuine. What is so shocking is the forced interventions (psychological therapy, institutionalizations, special education services, etc) these individuals experienced. Some were very necessary, but others, others were obviously methods being used by people who truly wished to shut \"others\" away. A great, and very real, read."}], "description": "A groundbreaking work of LGBT literature takes an honest look at the life, love, and struggles of transgender teens.Author and photographer Susan Kuklin met and interviewed six transgender or gender-neutral young adults and used her considerable skills to represent them thoughtfully and respectfully before, during, and after their personal acknowledgment of gender preference. Portraits, family photographs, and candid images grace the pages, augmenting the emotional and physical journey each youth has taken. Each honest discussion and disclosure, whether joyful or heartbreaking, is completely different from the other because of family dynamics, living situations, gender, and the transition these teens make in recognition of their true selves.", "title": "Beyond Magenta: Transgender Teens Speak Out", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18166920-beyond-magenta", "average": 3.87, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1384017436l/18166920.jpg", "reviews": 519, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/190477.Susan_Kuklin", "name": "Susan Kuklin"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Lgbt", "Glbt"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18166920-beyond-magenta", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22747838-beyond-magenta", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20819181-beyond-magenta", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3466294-no-choirboy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1115448.Families", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1115452.All_Aboard_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5870373-how-my-family-lives-in-america", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/480923.Iqbal_Masih_and_the_Crusaders_Against_Child_Slavery"]}
