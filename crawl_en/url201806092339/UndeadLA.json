Each vignette, while very different, has subtle links to the last. If you're like me, you bore easily. Not a chance of that happening with this read! Undead L.A. 1 has something for everyone to captivate them.Sagliani's vivid (and sometimes disturbed) imagination flows through the pages of his writing. His love for his home town clearly comes across in his work. While I have no doubt Angelinos will eat up the extensive shout outs to their city and cultural icons, for me it was the little references that made his work so intriguing. Sagliani not only gave a nod to one of my all-time favorite books, Steinbeck's Of Mice and Men, but also my favorite band, Godsmack. Ya, buddy! Having never explored the streets of Cali personally, Sagliani helps readers to envision the landscape and local venues with ease.Fair warning, Undead L.A. contains a plentiful amount of graphic violence. But if you're a true fan of the zombie genre, it's probably one of the caveats you most enjoy. In my profession, I've seen some pretty nasty things, but the acts committed in Undead L.A. were gruesome enough to make even me squeamish. Several times I found myself wincing in empathetic pain with his victims.Two stories really gripped me and got the wheels of my brain oscillating. In No One is Watching, the once coined city of angels quickly becomes a city in ruin. When order is no more, and rules no longer apply, morality and ethics become a thing of the past. Detective Gary Wendell uses the opportunity created by the chaos to settle an old vendetta with the one who got away. Seeking out Randy, a pedophile guilty of the heinous rape and murder of several young girls, Gary delivers sweet revenge and doles out his own sadistic justice. With an animal desire not unlike the zombies that infect the city, a years' worth of built up hate and animosity for Randy has turned him into the very animals he spent his life putting behind bars.Kathleen, a woman left with no hope, faces her end at the bottom of an Oxycontin bottle in To Live and Die in LA. Polluted with terminal cancer, schoolteacher Kat visits Los Angeles as her dying wish and attends the Emmys on the arms of a hunky star.I found myself giggling by the following excerpt, specifically because I, as a member of the chick-clique, always keep a set of tweezers in my car. No, not for the chin hair, thank you very much! You just never know when an eyebrow will go rogue. \"She was surprised by how distracted the drivers around them were, texting and talking on the phone and spacing out. One car they passed had a old woman with a large beauty mirror plucking the hairs on her chin as she inched forward in traffic.\"If Kat's story doesn't stretch your heart strings to their limit, I officially declare you a cold-hearted bastard. I love where Sagliani takes this story line. Its emotion and complexity bleeds through with every word.Allow me to conclude with this: Not picking up a copy of Undead L.A. 1 would be a blunder. I challenge readers to dive into his work and not fall in love. Riddled with powerful story lines and intense characters, Undead L.A. 1 delivers its readers with a riveting roller coaster read. Keep those creative juices flowing Devan! This reader can't wait to see what you come up with next.Don't miss out on The Bookie Monster's exclusive interview with author Devan Sagliani.

Rise of the Horde\u2019 & \u2018The Rising Dead\u2019. These zombies have spawned from a virus outbreak and they spread extremely quickly. Angelinos from varied backgrounds are spotlighted as they become caught up in the chaos of the outbreak. Who will live and who will die?This book tells the stories of several different people, giving their backgrounds and developing their characters within individual short stories of this apocalypse. The zombie outbreak changes everything, and everyone reacts differently to the threat. The horror is tense and brutal each time it hits, the shocks and twists delivered expertly throughout. This is an edge of seat read, suspenseful and captivating. I knew I wouldn\u2019t be able to put it down once I started so I wisely chose to read it when I had time to sit down and savour it.The characterisation is brilliant, with each character feeling totally real and believable in their own different ways. Some of them were likeable and others weren\u2019t, but they all felt like real people. I enjoyed Kathleen\u2019s story as she fought the symptoms of her terminal illness to go to the Emmys where zombies crashed the party. I also really liked the cop Gary, who has been trying to catch a sick killer when the outbreak allows him the freedom to serve up his own brand of justice. Those were my favourites but the stories were all gripping and very different for each person.I found this mix of stories to be a unique and interesting concept that works very well and I think this book is an excellent addition to the zombie genre. I very much look forward to the next part. Highly recommended zombie horror!"}, {"userName": "Ms. Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3291712-ms-nikki", "userReview": "A zombie virus has been unleashed on Los Angeles residents and the results are fast and devastating. If you're tired of mundane zombie reads with the same old \"survivor\" theme by a single point of view, this read will be a pleasant treat. You can tell from the first page that Mr. Sagliani respects his characters and it paid off. He makes it hard to not become invested in their outcome and the finesse with which he writes the lives and emotional upheavals of the players in these apocalyptic tales make this read flow and before you know it you are at the end wondering how he wrote so many characters so realistically. Characterization can be the driving factor of greatness or a book's downfall. For Sagliani, he excelled in this aspect in my opinion. The first story introduces you to a pilot who reminisces over how he's lived his life when the virus reaches the airport.  The second, a detective who goes too far in his attempts to catch a killer and is demoted to a new position. All the while he's keeping the killer and his crimes in the back of his mind. When the virus hits, Detective Wendell sees it as the perfect time for justice to be served. In another story, Pilar, wants to succeed and be someone. She works so hard she has hasn't had time to herself. When she does find someone to spend time with, it is short-lived. And Kathleen, who's been dealt a bad hand is turned away from death even though she'll eventually die. She finds no solace in the end times. I'm going on about the characters because they are that good. They are the force, the steam, that keep this read's dynamic pacing and terrific storytelling from stalling out.I look forward to reading more of Devan Sagliani's work.You can find more reviews at www.horrorafterdark.com"}, {"userName": "Kaisersoze", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22517400-kaisersoze", "userReview": "I'm legitimately torn on this one. On the one hand, Devan Sagliani is without doubt a very talented writer. His prose is incredibly well crafted and drew me in effortlessly. There's none of those awkward turns of phrase or jarring sentences that as a prolific reader of zombie-themed fiction, I've often had to wade through. And even better than his writing style, is his ability to create incredibly detailed and intricate characters that feel, in most cases, extremely real.But that strength is also this novel's greatest weakness. I picked up Undead L.A. 1 expecting to read about zombies. What I got instead were six short stories told from the perspective of individual Los Angelians that was less about zombies, and more about their lives in the lead up to the outbreak of the infection. In some of the stories, the zombies seemed to only pop up in the last few pages, which became eventually frustrating for me. There is one notable exception - the last tale - which I did enjoy greatly. Had there been more tales like this, my rating would have been far higher.As it stands, Sagliani is clearly a writer to keep an eye on. I'm interested to see where his planned sequel goes, as presumably, it will move the action forward in time, past the initial outbreak and into the actual battle against the undead. If that's the case, consider me pre-signed up.Recommended for fans of character-driven horror-drama, especially any such person familiar with or living in Los Angeles.3 Mauled on Angelians for Undead L.A. 1."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11628794-patricia", "userReview": "Undead LA is a compilation of short-stories with uniquely different characters - yet each story is linked. NO ONE IS WATCHING is one of the best and Detective Gary could be any detective in the USA with a heart crying out for justice. How he goes about exacting 'justice' is nothing short of fascinating, and I refused to stop reading until I found out how! DOGTOWN LOCALS UNION portrays life on the streets of LA - I lived through the lives of these strong, believable young men. Another of my favorites was LA CUCARACHA, starring an up-and-coming chef with her brilliant ideas for presenting food from her LA food trucks - and how she got involved with the equivalent of an LA mob - before, of course, zombies crashed onto the scene. CAMP ZOMBIE restored my faith in our younger generation; I was intrigued with the lives they created for themselves within their camp of youngsters - and how they pit themselves against the horror to come. TO LIVE AND DIE IN LA is another story that deserves kudos for creating believable characters - people who could be your very own neighbors, such as Kathleen. I wanted to take her home with me to try and save her from the cancer eating through her body but, of course, the zombies took care of that - but not in the way you might think. Read it and be surprised! LAX took me on my own trip as I struggled along with the pilot, Edgar, and flew with him in vain. Sagliani paints visual images that burn in my brain! He is extremely descriptive in his writing and I can SEE everything he writes about! I dare you - let Sagliani grab you with his imagination."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1460100-lori", "userReview": "Undead LA 1 follows the lives of several different LA locals as they witness the z-poc and it's aftermath. Each story is unique and gives the reader a complete picture of what happened. Devan's writing has really grown since his first release: Rise of the Horde (Zombie Attack! #1), which by the ways is an awesome zombie read too. His writing is grittier. I don't know if it was the vignette style of the book, or it being a bit noir in places, it's just very, very, tough. I loved it. The writing really hooked me. But I wasn't sunk until I got to my favorite of all the stories, it's the second story in the vol. and by far the one that I connected to and loved the most. This story follows detective Gary Windell as he hunts for a serial killer, only to have the man get away. When the zombies rise, Gary decides that he should search out Randy the serial and bring him to justice. It's a heart breaking, graphic, and violent story. The gore is galore, the writing is fast, and it's deep. The gross factor is here too, but it doesn't feel too much, and done for shock purposes. Every event feels real to the story. The characters are what drives these stories. There isn't a lot of interaction in some of the stories. Yet it doesn't feel isolated or over explained. It feels like you are in their heads living these events with them. It's a very cool reading experience. The flashbacks, the exposition, it all drives the stories forward. I really felt like I got to know them and experience these things with them. When Devan describes something it's very real. Especially when it comes to violence and survival. Their struggles seem very legit. Each vignette and character brought something new to the book. It wasn't just a zombie book. It showed us that people aren't always the greatest, but they may not deserve to die, and sometimes the wrong people get to live. It's a very real, very human book. Donny trying to not connect with his moms new boyfriend, Edgar the cheating airline pilot who thinks of his wife in his final moments. Kathleen and her triumphs and life as she watches people eat her favorite celebs. Pilar, and her food truck success, and Yermo protecting his turf . It's like real life nightmares. There is literally something for everyone in this book. I highly recommend it for zombie and horror fans."}, {"userName": "Books", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6665735-books", "userReview": "While reading \u201cUndead L.A.\u201d I had the opportunity to live the end of the world - or rather the end of L.A. - six times. From Edgar, the pilot, who tries to escape the horror of the zombie infestation in an airplane, to Guillermo, a teenager who makes a stand against said Zombies with his friends, each story is a suspense laden and highly emotional experience.Every one of these extremely well crafted characters deal with the crisis in his or her own way. Gary, the detective, decides to settle an old score while Donny tries to protect his gated community. At the same time some of the characters are simply victims of this horrible apocalypse. What I loved about the characters was that they are not at all perfect, but rather thoroughly flawed; thus making them as realistic as one would ever get inside the pages of a book of fiction.The six stories in this book are varied and truly give the reader a wide perspective of how differently people and communities would react in such a situation. In \u201cUndead L.A\u201d. the reader is taken on an intense journey through the streets of Los Angeles and given a look at the vast diversity of life in the city. In the midst of the horror, even the celebrities are reduced to mere panic stricken humans who realize that this is no action movie but truly the end of everything. As the film industry is so integral to Los Angeles, I had to smile at the frequent use of references to said industry. When kids broke the rules of safety against the zombies, they were said to \"go off script\". This and a few other examples brought a light touch of humor into these otherwise dark stories. For all readers who love a book full of action, suspense, lots of blood and gore, I highly recommend \u201cUndead L.A\u201d. I must however warn that this book contains graphic descriptions of sex, extreme violence, and strong language.

I didn\u2019t read the synopsis before I started this book (I usually don\u2019t) so I was definitely surprised when I learned that it was an anthology of short stories based upon the same zombie apocalypse. Each story is about a different person, or group of people, and who they were before the shit hit the fan and how they handled it once it dropped on them.Undead L.A. 1 is not a fast-paced, heart-racing zombie novel for the most part. It\u2019s more about the characters and their lives. Don\u2019t get me wrong, there were certainly parts of each story that were gory and hellish, but it was like watching one of those movies where you learn all about each set of characters and get a glimpse of what their lives are like and what they are going through, only to find out that they\u2019re all connected in some way. Obviously in this collection we already know that they\u2019re dealing with the same issues in the end, but that\u2019s the best way I can explain it.Each story is unique and I can imagine how people will connect with different stories within the whole, whether you like a good crime novel or contemporary fiction, you\u2019re going to get a taste of it here. It\u2019s obvious that Sagliani put a great deal of time into developing these characters and their own worlds. It\u2019s quite impressive the lengths he went to in order to put this all together. I\u2019m still trying to decide which is my favorite..

All my concerns were swept aside by some damn fine writing and great character development. This is the first novel I have read from Devan Sagliani and I will be back for some more. Each of the stories in this compilation is worthy of its own novel. For me the stand out story amongst them all was No One is Watching. This was great example of what can be achieved in a short story. Over the last couple of years I have come to embrace the short story be it either as a stand alone or in compilation form.

I don\u2019t even need to mention all the titans in Zombie stories that Sagliani stands on the shoulders of to launch his tale. You know them. That kid at Walmart in his flannel pajama bottoms that you just made fun of (or are, come on bro\u2026pants up!) is wearing a shirt for the show. What the little and big screen can deliver is a visual immersion into the survival nightmare, what film lacks, Sagliani delivers with! His attention to detail makes this story great. I loved his description on a mangled zombie with French tips and a lap dog. Edgar Reynolds is an unfaithful airline pilot who wakes up in a hotel to find he is in the middle of zombie apocalypse in LA. This was a lovely short horror story and the beginning of what promises to be a great series. I like the parallels the zombie story shares with postindustrial consumer culture. Ever been on \u201cautopilot\u201d throughout your day? Sure you have. Wouldn\u2019t becoming a zombie just be a nudge a bit further in that direction? Stare at phone in line to buy this.

In a genre which has produced thousands of (largely sub-par) works in the past decade, Devan has managed to produce some of the most consistently entertaining works in an over-saturated market. His Zombies Attack! Young Adult novels are my favorite of his works but, certainly not his only ones. Indeed, I was greatly looking forward to his Undead L.A. series and am sorry I didn't get to read them earlier. The premise of the book isn't particularly original: zombies appear in Los Angeles and we follow a group of individuals as they cope with the tragedy but the success of the novel is in the execution. Devan paints a picture of a Los Angeles full of people who are rich, poor, stupid, smart, good, and evil before analyzing how they react when the world goes to hell. Written along the lines of World War Z, Undead L.A. follows the adventures of several Los Angeles residents who are trying to survive a single day before the military bombs the hell out of the city. I confess, I was surprised to realize that would be the running theme as I'm used to the military completely screwing up in containing the zombie-virus. A collection format is generally a good idea because it allows the stories to be short, sweet, and often end on a depressing note. Only a few of the protagonists are rescued or manage to escape and that adds a somber but realistic note to the storyline. The cast of characters is also fairly diverse with an airline pilot, an inner city gangbanger's girlfriend, a dying schoolteacher, a migrant worker, and a cop who doesn't play by the rules. I confess, I felt the last one was a bit of a stereotype but once I thought of him as Al Pachino's character from Heat, I had to say his story rocketed up to the top of my favorites. Los Angeles has always been a setting for Noir fiction, ironically because it's the exact opposite of the dark and rainy cities the genre was created in. Los Angeles is a beautiful city on the outside but home to countless stories of sex, crime, corruption, and abuse. Devan Sagliani draws from this genre for many of his stories and quite a few are more than halfway over before the zombies show up. For those who want to watch people struggling through zombie-infested hell, this book is probably not for them as the zombies are more of a coda that brings an end to the stories rather than the driving force. It may not be for everyone but I think this nicely differentiates the collection from others in the genre. The zombies here are the inevitability of death and while one story deals with survival, it's a bait-and-switch since survival is an illusion because we know the city is going to be reduced to rubble soon. Of the stories within the book, I'd have to say I probably enjoyed the police officer's tale the most. Detective Gary Wendell is a archetypal cop chasing after a serial killer who is eluding the cops thanks to his high priced lawyers and a lack of evidence. The end of the world should mean more than this but it's also an opportunity for justice: but does that accomplish anything and can it really be justice if killing a monster prevents Gary from helping others? Lots of interesting questions there and while there were a few contrived coincidences in the story, I still think it was great. I also enjoyed the story of Edgar Renyolds the Airline Pilot, who is a complete ass and one who probably deserves to be eaten by zombies but you have to admire the tenacity of. I found the story of Kathleen the school teacher also effecting as she doesn't have much time left but deserves to spend it better than in this hell. Not all of the stories were 100% to my tastes and some of the endings made me mad but, overall, I very much enjoyed this novel and recommend it to all zombie fans.9/10"}, {"userName": "ari", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13178608-ari", "userReview": "A couple weeks prior to this review, I received a request from author Devan Sagliani -- asking if I would like to read his adult zombie-apocalyptic book. It was the beginning of October and I had been on a hunt for a zombie-based book, so I decided the timing was perfect. UNDEAD L.A is a book filled with short stories that in some way relate to one another. Everything you thought you knew about these rabid killers \u2013 their ways \u2026 their behavior, throw it ALL away. Devan Sagliani takes zombies to a WHOLE new level; they are faster, lively (hah, the irony), and gives the living a smaller chance of making it alive. This, this is what I was looking for! With this genre done so often, it is hard to be original with anything. Every film or books with zombies in them, I always had wondered why make them the main deal \u2013 hunter of the plot when they can\u2019t even move fast enough to take down their prey. Where is the thrill in that?As much as I love zombie-apocalyptics and enjoyed this book (most parts), I have a weak stomach and was never one to handle graphic-gruesome images well, and this book had a lot of that. I should probably mention again ADULTS ONLY please! It was during the second story - further into the book, I was disgusted with the characters, especially Randy. He was sick (if I were one to curse, I imagine I would have A LOT of bad words ready for him); just thinking about it now \u2026 it is disturbing. If you are not one to handle such graphics well, I suggest stay clear from this book. However, it did not mean I did not enjoy the other stories. In a book with more than one story it is likely that you will lean towards one, more than the other. And that\u2019s just how it was for me. One of my favorites was with Kathleen-a girl who is fighting cancer and the very first story with the pilot, Edgar.I felt chills as I read this book and because of Devan Sagliani\u2019s descriptive and detailed writing, I could even form the image of the neck torn apart and livers gushing out (yeah, gross!). Horror, thriller, and even some humor, If this is your thing, your element, please give UNDEAD L.A. a read. And to my younger followers I will be reading Devan\u2019s YA zombie book, and will tell you all about it (I haven\u2019t forgotten you)! 3.5/5 stars, because I enjoyed parts of it and I thought the idea of the whole structure of the book was unique. I had to deduct 2 stars, because of the graphics (I am a weakling!) and there were a story or two that I couldn\u2019t really get into. Other than that, a book fit for the upcoming holiday of Halloween. Enjoy!Thank you Devan for the ARCs and seeking me out!

Several perspectives show the varying responses to what could be the last few hours these individuals have left. Revenge, love, suicide, fighting back, becoming one of the undead. Each story is unique and each Los Angeles citizen finds their own way through the zombie apocalypse.This was honestly my first zombie novel, I've always watched zombie movies (and always will) and I enjoyed reading about zombies more than I thought I would. I never realized I could get the same frighteningly awful zombie experience in all their bloody awesomeness through written descriptions. Sagliani did a great job providing details of blood thirsty hellions tearing, ripping, biting, and bleeding across the pages that had me laughing at my own squeamish responses.

As an avid reader of zombie books, having the opportunity to read what happened during the start of a zombie apocalypse from different perspectives was interesting to me. However, as I read on, it became apparent that the stories seemed less about the zombie outbreak and more about what happened in each person's life leading up to the outbreak. More often than not, I got lost in the reading and ended up forgetting I was even reading a zombie novel!Though the writing was good and I loved the attention to detail of each character and how every story connected with the next one, I was disappointed in the book as a whole.

I love dystopian novels but have mixed feelings when it comes to short stories. After reading it, I can't see how this book could have been better.Each story, though short, was incredibly in depth. Readers have time to get to know the characters and what makes them tick. We learn their history, strengths, and weaknesses. We are able relate to and become invested in them. Though each tale is unique, the zombie outbreak ties the book together and we experience it through different eyes and see how reactions vary from person to person. I think the author's ability to take a plot that does not change and leave readers feeling as if they've been treated to a different full-length novel with each story is nothing short of amazing. I highly recommend this author and look forward to reading more of his work!"}, {"userName": "Patti", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16427962-patti", "userReview": "Good idea, lousy implementation.Sagliani tried too many tricks, which had me rolling my eyes a quarter of the way thru. Characters motivations came out of nowhere, women were seen as weak, willing, and/or bitches. I gave up around the halfway mark when the cop who despised his female partner decided she tracked him down because she wanted him and he indicated he was receptive to that.Not worth it."}, {"userName": "Brandi Garza", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42869199-brandi-garza", "userReview": "Eh not spectacular but not horribleI chose this rating because the book left more questions than it answered.

I would definitely read something else by this author."}, {"userName": "Adam Geise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22614077-adam-geise", "userReview": "Vignettes of the outbreakinteresting take and format for the genre. separate vignettes of different aspects and lives of Angelenos during a zombie outbreak.

Half of it features Eddie's flight history as a pilot, life story, seeing a rapper hit a photographer in the airport, bitchy comments about the girlfriend he cheats on his wife with, the girlfriend's sexual partners, checking into the hotel, his married life woes...that was all very boring. It did improve when the zombies finally arrive and he has to escape the airport on his plane, but all the dumb waffle leading up to it wasn't needed. I decided not to read on after other reviews suggested the same format for each short story."}], "description": "On September 20, the zombie virus was released into the dense population of transients on Skid Row in downtown Los Angeles.
