In a barely fictional California coastal town - that's about two hours from where I live and, to the writer's credit, I feel pretty sure I've been there - the locals of a sleepy tourist town prepare for Christmas. A handful of middle-aged divorcees, lonesome loners, curmudgeons, and crazies bitch and bumble their way through a hair-(and more)-raising couple days. A celestial visitor scares the bejesus out of the local constable, who's got his hands full sorting out a town's worth of mischief and mayhem. Do all of Christopher Moore's books include angels and a undercurrent of Christianity? I've only read two Moores so far, but I'm two for two on the jesus and god shit. I should probably look for titles without \"gospel\" and \"angel\" in them. This isn't as funny as I'd hoped. In fact, neither of his books lived up to the hype I built up after reading a few reviews. I got a snort or two out of The Stupidest Angel, but generally I find his humor to be dated and easy, as in, he goes for the easy gag. There were a few insightful satirical jabs, but not enough to make me feel it was worth the read."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "This is another Christopher Moore book I have enjoyed reading, and they have all been hilarious.Very funny and it had that Christopher Moore kookiness, even some returns of fun characters.

This novel is not the type of book I normally read. The plot was quite thin but there were tons of funny scenes that made me giggle and snicker (it wasn't funny enough to make me laugh out loud). However I got bored with this book pretty quickly. The humour in this book is very \"in your face\" type humour. The humour was just so repetitive that it started to get on my nerves after a while and the jokes just stopped being funny. I didn't like the second half of the book as it just got too far-fetched and stupid. I really struggled to finish it. I don't think this sort of book is for everyone and I'm not sure that I'll ever read another book by Christopher Moore. He's the type of author I would get bored of very easily.

But this is not that kind of Christmas story, so here in not too many pages, someone is going to dispatch the miserable son of a bitch with a shovel. That's the spirit of Christmas yet to come in these parts. Ho, ho, ho.The Stupidest Angel is anything but the normal Christmas tale. Christopher Moore has revived the residents of Pine Cove, and some other characters from his other novels, with all their silliness and insanity and added an angel that is one part the Terminator and two part Jim Carry from Dumb and Dumber. This rather short novel has more one-liners than a Henny Youngman convention and more laughs than a barrel of tea party congressmen. I especially loved the return of Roberto T. Fruitbat from Island of the Sequined Love Nun but you do not need to have read any of Moore's other novels to enjoy this one.

C'mon, washed-up female-battle-warrior cult movie star whos totally nuts (in a friendly crazy neighbor sort of way) married to pot smoking sherrif. DEA helicopeter subcontractor helps woman he's never met clean up a crime scene, and introduces her to his pet fruit bat. Oh, yeah, and then there is the stupidest angel, and the sherrif's biologist friend who's doing some pretty wierd stuff with conditioning rats that just might work on him too... something about batteries and electrodes and underwear models... a little \"goy\" kid and his ruminations on whos got better holidays, and what's gonna get him on the bad list at the north pole. Kinda throws believable out the window before you even start the book.

I saw the movie Zombieland this past weekend and that might have just put me in the right frame of mind for this book.Humor in literature is a very subjective thing. What makes one person laugh his butt off is just dumb and annoying to someone else. I love the humor of Connie Willis and I am amused by the Thursday Next series by Jasper Fforde. I've had quite a few laugh-out-loud moments reading Jim Butcher's Dresden Files series. Personally, I just didn't find The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy or the first book in the Discworld series, The Color of Magic, funny at all, but a lot of people I know love these books. So, if you read The Stupidest Angel and hate it, don't blame me. We just might not have the same taste.I don't know why I haven't read any of Christopher Moore's work before.

Raziel seeks to rectify the matter by raising Santa--and every other corpse in the graveyard--from the dead on Christmas Eve. Chaos ensues, said zombies ultimately subdued--hacked back to death--by retired B-movie actress Molly, reprising her signature role of Kendra, Warrior Babe of the Outland complete with sword.

My husband and I have gotten into a habit of listening to audiobooks in the car when we travel to and from work, and when we take little road trips.Christopher Moore's books seem to be the most addictive for us even with the sometimes dark humor and harsh content. The Stupidest Angel is no exception.The book is set in Pine Cove, Calif., where the Archangel Raziel is set upon Earth to grant a Christmas wish to one child. That child is Josh Barker. Unfortunately, Josh has no idea what is in store when he asks the angel to bring Santa Claus back to life.With characters like a Warrior babe named Molly, a pot-smoking constable--her husband, a DEA helicopter pilot, and a evil developer, among others, there was nothing to do but sit back and laugh at the follies, misunderstandings, and interactions between these characters. Of course, there had to be a speaking, sunglasses wearing, fruit bat named Roberto! These characters stumble around in their relationships with one another, insulting their spouses and their friends, only to make up in the end, but the ride is raucous.It gets even crazier in Pine Cover when Molly goes off her medications and starts hearing the narrator in her head, giving her direction. She wonders off into the woods naked and carrying a Japanese sword where she meets Raziel who only wants to eat the marshmallows out of the cocoa packets. Meanwhile, zombies are raging war against the townspeople at the Lonesome Christmas celebration in the local church.
