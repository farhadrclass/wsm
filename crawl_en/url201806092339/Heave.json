She bolts from the church leaving pieces of her gown in the door, crying and laughing, runs through the town and all the way out a country road to her parents home. She takes refuge in an outhouse, one of several that her father has collected and placed around the property.From there, \"Serrie\" looks back over her life - her stint in rehab, her sudden and unexplained flight to England, and the time she spent in an asylum - trying to figure out how she got to this point in her life. We learn about her mother and brother, her gentle father, her grandmother, a practical woman with a sometimes scornful and always pointed way of sharing her opinion (my favorite character in this book), and her best friends Dearie and Elizabeth. The characters are all as quirky and hard to fathom as real people and are what make this book tick, far more than the plot.On the cover of my library copy a reviewer says this book is \"a wildly energetic debut\" and another calls it \"astonishing\" and \"gorgeously fun\". I didn't find it wild or energetic, astonishing or even that much fun, but I did the like beautiful Nova Scotia setting and the wonderfully flawed, so very human characters. I didn't like some of the language, the fairly creepy cover or the way the book ended. Actually it didn't feel like an ending to me at all. I was left thinking \"Ok....so then what?\".So...I liked \"Heave\" to a point, but not enough to recommend it. I chose it because other reviewers talked about the rural N.S. landscape and the endearing small town characters; it just turned out to be a little grittier than I'd expected. It certainly has it's good points; it just wasn't what I was looking for."}, {"userName": "Cheryl Davis", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29931303-cheryl-davis", "userReview": "Wonderful book written by my former creative writing teacher."}, {"userName": "Theryn Fleming", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3792352-theryn-fleming", "userReview": "My Heave post."}, {"userName": "Sally Edsall", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59775414-sally-edsall", "userReview": "I picked this book up on a visit to Nova Scotia in February 2003, and I am most impressed. Set mostly in the Annapolis Valley, and partly in Halifax, I felt Conlin drew word pictures of the area and its people that rang very true. The student life in Halifax came to life, as I enjoyed the vibrant and youthful pub scene in Halifax (I am old enough to be those students' parent but the scene was so age-mixed it was very welcoming).Like most early novels, this one seems to have more than a touch of autobiography. Apart from the truthfulness of the setting, Conlin has really got to the heart of the depression and aloneness of the young who stand somewhat apart from the mores and values of theur family. The tensions within family, where there is often unstated, but overwhelming love which somehow just isn't adequately communicated, was painful, raw, and honest.A growing-up story by a young writer who is a real talent. Melancholy (as I find much Canadian literature to be) but ultimately a book of hope."}, {"userName": "Pooker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4254245-pooker", "userReview": "Christmas booty - One of the 2011 Canada Reads top 40I've never been to Nova Scotia, so I don't know if Lupin's Cove, Bigelow or Foster are real or fictional places. It does not matter; I want to go there. I want to go to the world that Christy Conlin created for me in Nova Scotia. I want to walk (or even run) Lupin Cove Road. I want to smell the salty air of the Bay of Fundy and the pine and the stinky fish. I especially want to see Cyril's outhouses and sit in #9.Cyril, Seraphina Sullivan's father, reminds me a bit of my own dad and his crackpot, yet somehow wise ideas.In fact Seraphina Sullivan's family reminds me of my own family, of every family really and yet like no other.I love books about family and the relationships in them. Serrie's family is full of eccentric characters. But then don't we all think of our own families as a little bit odd, a little embarrassing and yet, when it comes down to it, so so special? I howled with laughter (in cahoots with Serrie's friends, Dearie and Elizabeth) and mortification (for Serrie herself) when Serrie goes shopping for a bathing suit with her Aunt Gallie and \"the great-bargain-maple-leaf suit was purchased.\"As I read I loved more and more the relationship Serrie had with her friends Dearie and Elizabeth. They are best friends for ever and ever no matter where any of them might be or what warts and short comings they had. So too, I loved Serrie's relationship with her brother Percy, each of them seeming to know what the other was enduring, there for each other. And with her father in his gentle, slow witted way. As for Serrie's mother, I saw her as hardworking, devoted and loving, although in a somewhat understated quiet way. The best of course is Serrie's (and the whole family's) relationship with Grammie. Grammie is not understated in any way. It is Grammie who holds the family together and \"pushes [it] through\" the hard times.I think I loved Serrie the most, although she was perhaps the hardest for me to understand. Perhaps that's why. Why was she crazily fleeing her wedding? Why did her hard but not overly unusual childhood end up with her becoming a troubled drunk as a teen? Why did she describe her family as \"a house full of ornament people in danger of falling over and shattering\"?The ending of this book took me by surprise and I found I had to reassess some of the things I thought I knew. And so I hearkened back to Grammie's advice, \"...there was always an adjustment period, where you just have to go about your business, even if you felt bad, and let things settle, allow life to find a pace and a routine.\"A wonderful book!"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4972715-chris", "userReview": "Oh this was a hard read, the kind where you want to smack most of the characters upside the head and say, \"Stop self-destructing!\" But of course that never works, not in real life and not in good literature. Heave is one of the more realistic portrayals of modern rural Nova Scotian life I've read. It ain't your great-great grandmother's Valley, that's for sure. Its brilliance is its characters, who are charming yet often spiteful, nasty people with bitter pasts, psychotic family dynamics and bellyfuls of anger keeping them from making good choices. And that includes the protagonist, Serrie. I became attached to her despite her flaws and my stomach knotted whenever I saw new troubles coming at her, which was pretty much in every chapter, right to the awful end. And this was done despite some unusual, and somewhat distracting, flitting between second and first-person narrative. But the story was strong enough to hold me through that and Serrie's downward spiral - not your typical junkie-does-bad story - will stay with me for some time."}, {"userName": "Meghan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14613561-meghan", "userReview": "This book made me homesick for Nova Scotia so badly. Conlin captures the valley and Halifax so well, the characters using just the right amount of Nova Scotia vernacular to make it believable without becoming caricatured. The story is slow to start off and quite dense for the first few pages. Characters are sometimes thrown in with formal introductions being made a hundred pages later (like Gordie). But the story really starts to take off somewhere around page forty, where if the reader has persevered through what seems to be impenetrable stream-of-consciousness drunken ramblings, you are treated to an engaging picture of life on the east coast.The ending, however, much like the beginning, is unsatisfying. The last ten pages or so feel rushed and so much happens so quickly that it is disappointing to get so far only to have so much fall apart with what it seems to be a mad dash to the finish, leaving as much emotional carnage in its wake as possible."}, {"userName": "Eugene Lakinsky", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36878090-eugene-lakinsky", "userReview": "This book is a remarkable source of information for all those who are interested in Nova Scotia\u2019s culture and everyday life. As for the novel itself\u2026 Well, all the characters are alive and well-developed. So, we do care for Serrie. The plot is interesting to follow. Why have Serrie fled to London? Will she find a right boyfriend? Will she return to the university? Etc.However, the author tries to describe every single detail in every single scene, as well as every single thought, feeling and association. And it\u2019s a little bit too much: it may take Serrie some 2 pages to drink a cup of tea, to eat a sandwich or to walk 10 meters. Sometimes, it\u2019s simply difficult to follow the story."}, {"userName": "R.

I must say I was somewhat unprepared for the heaping helpings of human unhappiness and tragedy captured so unsparingly in its pages. I did think that one of the tragedies was a bit on the gratuitous side. But there is no denying Conlin's very large talents. I look forward to reading her new novel Memento at some point."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6304999-beth", "userReview": "The jacket promised a female version of Catcher in the Rye, and I found I liked this book more for that concept than for its actual execution.

Serrie\u2019s got a nasty secret. It\u2019s festering inside her, because in the gothic Annapolis Valley, hey, that\u2019s what you do \u2014 you never show and you never, ever tell.As she dashes from her wedding altar on the run of her life, ardently wanting to understand what has brought her to this moment, Serrie sweeps us up in an exhilarating and poignant journey from rural Nova Scotia to London bars, to strip clubs by the docks, through mental hospital wards and rehab centres, back to quiet verandahs and porch swings in serene Lupin Cove. Along the way we meet a delightful array of off-beat characters including Serrie\u2019s best friends, Dearie and Elizabeth: Dearie, the anglicized Acadian who wants to go to New Orleans to find her Cajun relatives, and Elizabeth, who would like nothing better than to spend the rest of her life picking strawberries.Heave explores the joys and agonies of family, of what one generation inherits from the next, and of how past and present are inexorably linked. Memories weave through the book as Serrie searches for equanimity in a life that intoxicates her with its beauty as it knocks her to her knees.", "title": "Heave", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1169937.Heave", "average": 3.56, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1181603003l/1169937.jpg", "reviews": 15, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/571424.Christy_Ann_Conlin", "name": "Christy Ann Conlin"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Contemporary", "Humor"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1169937.Heave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1169938.Heave", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29858044-the-memento", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9867815-dead-time-shelter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13274147-listening-to-the-island"]}
