Dick. The comparisons to Vonnegut\u2019s Ice nine from Cat's Cradle will be inevitable, but the distinction is one of procedure rather than substance.Vonnegut used Ice nine as a plot device, whereas Ballard\u2019s crystals are a metaphor for our unavoidable demise, our inescapable mortality. The novel\u2019s protagonist Dr. Sanders\u2019 specializes in the treatment of leprosy patients in rural Africa, and several connections are made between the spread of leprosy and the strange crystallization. Also evident, though somewhat muted, is Ballard\u2019s search for faith and questions about the crystallization as a symbol for Christianity.Visually, this is impressive and mesmerizing. The world Ballard creates, his pulsating description of the crystals and jewels in the jungle sunlight and making strange silhouettes of the characters is dazzling, as if he had painted a portrait.First published in 1966, a reader may ask of what sort is this speculative fiction? Science Fiction, fantasy, magical realism? Was Ballard stoned out of his mind? Do crystals look cool in the glow of a lava lamp? And of what importance does Ballard make to the diamond mines trapped in irony amongst the crystal jungles?Ballard answers many questions, but leaves many unanswered in this hypnotic but puzzling tale. Ultimately satisfying and demonstrating the author\u2019s great imagination and ability, this nonetheless has locked up in its basement the muffled howling of the absurd. Samuel Beckett and Eug\u00e8ne Ionesco fans take note, there are crystals in the forest."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "What do I think of this novel? I already got a glimpse of it amidst several of the first half of the complete short stories of Ballard, so I knew what to expect before sinking my teeth in it. Time flowers leads to these crystals. The Illuminated Man himself was drawn into the theme of the Crystal World. There's a lot of great imagery going on, and surprisingly, it isn't just the descriptions of the the world being consumed by a time-reversed (or rather, collided time with anti-time) semi-liquid crystals that shine with their own internal light. There's a dialog about religion and survivalism, an undercurrent of revenge and guilt, acceptance and futility. People do say it's a sci-fi equivalent of Heart of Darkness, but I think it's more than that.I like to digest some of the deeper currents in the work. Discover how it truly applies to the crystallizing world. After all, the tortured priest discovered that God is inside everything that has been transformed. The world is becoming eternal and obviously much more gorgeous than it had ever been. The very images are showing us that things are not dark, but the exact opposite. Yes, the world is dying, somewhat, or at least becoming something that normal people cannot touch without becoming a part of it, but it is definitely not clear that those who'd succumbed are now unhappy or dead. This isn't just a thoroughly exacting tribute. I think it's more of a refutation."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "Ballard novel: subject, end time.

Ballard\u2019s third apocalyptic work in which he destroys civilization, the other two being The Burning World (1964) and The Drowned World (1962). It seems he likes the elements, having employed floods, draughts, and now crystallization. The process somewhat resembles Ice-9 in Kurt Vonnegut\u2019s Cat\u2019s Cradle (1963), but there is no ironic humor to be found in this book as far I could tell. In The Drowned World, the flooding of the world was used as a metaphor for diving deep into the collective racial memories of the Triassic-age, when dinosaurs ruled the Earth. This time, Ballard posits a mysterious crystallization process in the forests of Gabon, which slowly transforms everything around it into organic crystals, including plants, minerals, and living creatures.The crystal trees among them were hung with glass-like trellises of moss. The air was markedly cooler, as if everything was sheathed in ice, but a ceaseless play of light poured through the canopy overhead. The process of crystallization was more advanced. The fences along the road were so encrusted that they formed a continuous palisade, a white frost at least six inches thick on either side of the palings. The few houses between the trees glistened like wedding cakes, white roofs and chimneys transformed into exotic minarets and baroque domes. On a lawn of green glass spurs, a child\u2019s tricycle gleamed like a Faberge gem, the wheels starred into brilliant jasper crowns.He had entered an endless subterranean cavern, where jeweled rocks loomed out of the spectral gloom like marine plants, the sprays of glass forming white fountains. Several times he crossed and recrossed the road. The spurs were almost waist-high, and he was forced to climb over the brittle stems. Once, as he rested against the trunk of a bifurcated oak, an immense multi-colored bird erupted from a bough over his head, and flew off with a wild screech, aureoles of light cascading from its red and yellow wings. At last the storm subsided, and a pale light filtered through the stained-glass canopy. Again, the forest was a place of rainbows, a deep, iridescent light glowing from within.The main character is Edward Sanders, a British doctor trying to reach a leprosy facility deep in the jungles of Africa. Surprise surprise, he takes a journey upriver and encounters various dark natives as well as some corrupt white men intent on pursuing their own agendas. Does this sound at all familiar? It\u2019s an overt tribute to Joseph Conrad\u2019s Heart of Darkness (1899), but unfortunately The Crystal World does not add anything to that seminal symbolic journey. Dr. Sanders repeatedly questions his own motivations to join his friends at the leprosy facility, wondering whether his intentions are truly altruistic, or whether he is strangely drawn to the disease. As he encounters parts of the forest that are starting to crystallize, he sees that some of the lepers are drawn to it as a way to slow the progress of the disease and to cheat death. Other characters, even though outwardly healthy, seem to also embrace this process due to their repressed emotional lives. Ballard juxtaposes the opposing forces of leprosy (representing decay and entropy) and crystallization (stopping time and death, a symbol of eternity and perfection). He then expounds on a mind-bending and probably incoherent description of time, matter, anti-matter, and distant universes to explain the mysterious crystallization process:But it is still only a year since the Mt. Palomar astronomers discovered the first double-galaxy in the Andromeda galaxy, the great oblate diadem that is probably the most beautiful object in the physical universe, the island galaxy M-31. Without doubt, these random transfigurations throughout the world are a reflection of distant cosmic processes of enormous scope and dimensions first glimpsed in the Andromeda spiral. We now know that it is time, time with a Midas touch, which is responsible for the transformation. The recent discovery of anti-matter in the universe inevitably involves the conception of anti-time as the fourth side of this negatively-charged continuum. Where anti-particle and particle collide, they not only destroy their own physical identities, but their opposing time values eliminate each other, subtracting from the universe another quantum from its total share of time.It is random discharges of this type, set off by the creation of anti-galaxies in space, which have led to the depletion of the time store available to the materials of our own solar system. Just as a super-saturated solution will discharge itself into a crystalline mass, so the super-saturation of our solar system leads to its appearance in a parallel spatial matrix. As more and more time leaks away, the process of super-saturation continues, the original atoms and molecules producing spatial replicas of themselves, substance without mass, in an attempt to increase their foothold upon existence. The process is theoretically without end, and it may be possible for a single atom to produce an infinite number of duplicates of itself, and so fill the entire universe, from which simultaneously all time is expired, an ultimate macrocosmic zero beyond the wildest dreams of Plato and Democritus.Despite the languid, hallucinatory descriptions of crystallization, time, and space, the events that occur to Dr. Sanders as he journeys up the river have a curiously flat, empty quality to them. Because Ballard\u2019s stories are not filled with excitement or sympathetic characters, it is difficult to become engaged unless you allow the imagery and limpid storytelling to creep into your unconscious mind. That\u2019s why, when I first listened to both The Drowned World and The Crystal World on audiobook, I was somewhat disappointed. But because they are both under 6 hours, and because David Pringle praised both profusely and selected them for his Science Fiction: The 100 Best Novels (1985), I listened a second time to give them my full attention. I found The Drowned World to be much better, and I was duly impressed.On the other hand, even after a second listen, The Crystal World left me cold and detached. Although his descriptive writing was still impressive at times, Ballard spent far too much time on the pointless interactions of the main characters. It\u2019s interesting to note that in Ballard\u2019s personal life, between the publication of The Drowned World in 1962 and The Crystal World in 1966, he suffered the tragedy of suddenly losing his wife to pneumonia in 1964. It\u2019s impossible to know exactly what affect that had on his writing, but it must have impacted his life profoundly, since he was then left to raise their three children on his own. It\u2019s always tricky to speculate how an author\u2019s life is reflected in their work, but I certainly detected an emotional detachment in the character of Dr. Sanders, and his involvement with other people.Notably, Ballard began to write the experimental \u2018condensed novels\u2019 in 1965 that were collected as The Atrocity Exhibition (1970), a book that was so controversial that Nelson Doubleday had the entire first US printing destroyed out of concerns for legal action, since stories had titles like \u201cPlans for the Assassination of Jacqueline Kennedy,\u201d \u201cLove and Napalm: Export USA,\u201d and \u201cWhy I Want to Fuck Ronald Reagan.\u201d Suffice to say he was working through some major issues through his writing, but I suspect that it was more the events of the time, namely the assassination of JFK and the Vietnam War, that were foremost on his mind.Nonetheless, The Crystal World remains an interesting read if you are interested in New Wave SF from the 1960s, but for my money I preferred The Drowned World. Since it seems somewhat fitting, I\u2019ll end with Robert Frost\u2019s famous poem Fire and Ice: Some say the world will end in fire, Some say in ice. From what I\u2019ve tasted of desire I hold with those who favor fire. But if it had to perish twice, I think I know enough of hate To say that for destruction ice Is also great And would suffice."}, {"userName": "RandomAnthony", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/721021-randomanthony", "userReview": "JG Ballard\u2019s The Crystal World is a mindbending book that, by the last page, I was glad to end. The premise is fascinating; out of nowhere jungles across the globe begin to crystallize. The crystallization slowly spreads, enveloping everything in its path, including animals, buildings, and people. Ballard is enamored with describing the silent, alien landscape inherent in the crystal zone, definitely to the point where the jungle becomes a character and possibly to the point of overkill. The novel focuses on a doctor from a leprosy clinic searching for his former lover who may or may not be caught in the crystal zone. He meets a journalist, a strange priest, and, uh, an adventurer-type (not sure what else to call him) just outside the forest and connects and disconnects with each as he delves deeper into the jungle. The Crystal World reads like Ballard\u2019s version of Heart of Darkness except the jungle appears to balance on the cusp between crepuscule* and blinding light. Characters dwell in the same regions (symbolically too, of course) and can get lost in either area. My main problem with the book was the fact the crystal jungle is so overwhelming the characters can seem stock and half-drawn. At one point a couple characters just\u2026fuck. I would probably not have noticed if they didn\u2019t reference the act later. I could see why Ballard wanted them to fuck but the sex seemed more like a plot device than anything authentic. Oh, and Ballard includes cool space/time metaphysics that flew way over my head. I can see why people like Neil Gaiman and William Gibson love Ballard. He writes tight, detached prose that fits his subject matter. I\u2019ll read more of his material, probably Crash, this spring. Tadpole says The Crystal World isn\u2019t one of Ballard\u2019s major works and I\u2019m curious enough to delve into his other books.

I wondered if this was all a metaphor for wanting to fuck one of my literary heroes. \"You know, overall, you're not really that great of a writer.\" \"Yes,\" he said, \"But I can describe like a motherfucker.

Ballard advised that a writer shouldn't write too many books. I took this to mean that a person can expend their reserve of creativity and end up becoming a pale imitation of themselves. I also gathered that this advice came from Ballard's personal experience.I haven't read most of his material, but I have dipped into examples from numerous points in his career, and while I agree that his later offerings were rather flat, the problem of diminishing returns can be seen as early as his third apocalyptic novel, The Crystal World, wherein the very Earth around us begins to turn to glass.The concept of our planet spontaneously transforming to crystal is potentially compelling. The decadent morbidity of it is enough to inspire any writer stuck behind a typewriter. However, Ballard was in the position of having already imagined two other kinds of apocalypses - one brilliantly rendered, the other less so, but both pulsing with lived experience and a perverse desire to journey into the dark.With The Crystal World, he seems to have exhausted his insight into the threat of human extinction. That leaves him with the surreal imagery of his Daliesque catastrophe to keep the reader interested. Ultimately, it felt like a bit of a superficial affair, with not enough drive behind the characters actions to keep me interested.Can a writer write too many books? I know that Ballard bounced back from this misfire.

Ballard is one of the few writers I've encountered who can utilize descriptive language to its full effect, without sounding like he wrote with the thesaurus open on his lap, and without sounding kitschy. The prose mesmerizes.Like his other novels, Ballard is concerned with the effects of modernization on humanity, and how it dehumanizes society by driving us toward our most base, anti-social instincts. The Crystal World illustrates a world where individuals separate themselves from time and each other, through the slow, replicative process of crystallization, and, of course, the individuals of this novel (cardboard cutouts mostly, as that is Ballard's way, in order to exaggerate the anti-social consequences) are drawn even deeper into the jungle and their own crystallized solace, most often exemplified in the wearing of sunglasses, the push-pull nature of relationships, and the twinned relationships of some of the characters.Much like Conrad's Heart of Darkness, this novel is uncomfortable in the way it uses Africa as a setting to demonstrate the inhumane nature of imperialistic culture, which is never signaled or winked at to demonstrate awareness, so, without prior exposure to Heart of Darkness, some readers might not realize what he's doing. That said, it is fair to criticize Ballard's tendency to use Africa (and race relations) in this way, especially when it often feels like he is both reaffirming stereotypes, and othering/dehumanizing the primary population of the setting."}, {"userName": "\u039c\u03b9\u03c7\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7253517", "userReview": "\u039f Ballard \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b7 \u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7, \u03c4\u03bf \u03af\u03b4\u03b9\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc.\u03a5\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b9\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae, \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03c0\u03b1\u03b8\u03b7\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03c7\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03ba\u03c4\u03ae\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c1\u03b3\u03b7 \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03c0\u03c4\u03c5\u03be\u03b7 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1\u03c2, \u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03bb\u03b9\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2.\u039a\u03b1\u03b9 \u03cc\u03bc\u03c9\u03c2, \u03cc\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03c1\u03cd\u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b4\u03ac\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u03c5\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03ad\u03c1\u03b3\u03bf \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b5\u03b1\u03bb\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03b8\u03b1 \u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1 \u03bf\u03bc\u03bf\u03c1\u03c6\u03b9\u03ac \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ce\u03c2 \u03bf \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b2\u03ae\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b8\u03ce\u03c2 \u03cc\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c7\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1 \u03ad\u03be\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac \u03bc\u03b1\u03c2, \u03ad\u03c4\u03c3\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae \u03c3\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b4\u03af\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ae \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c7\u03b7 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c1\u03b3\u03ac, \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b5\u03c4\u03ce\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03c8\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1."}, {"userName": "Shawn", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1697111-shawn", "userReview": "Probably the best of the Ballard \"elemental apocalypse\" quartet (or it ties with The Drowned World at least).

(yeah, I\u2019m a dick)) discusses with a priest how the light \u201cis always like this, very heavy and penumbral\u2014do you know Bocklin\u2019s painting, \u2018Island of the Dead,\u2019 where the cypresses stand guard above a cliff pierced by a hypogeum, while a storm hovers over the sea?\u201d (11), which means that this picks up where Zelazny\u2019s Isle of the Dead leaves off, as both build their scenes specifically from the painting. (It is a cool painting, even if the Z book is godsawful.) Principal events occur however deeper in colonial space, \u201cthis isolated corner of the Cameroon Republic,\u201d which was \u201cstill recovering from an abortive coup ten years earlier, when a handful of rebels had seized the emerald and diamond mines,\u201d as \u201ca French military mission supervised the training of the local troops\u201d (10).Doctor\u2019s fame precedes him: \u201cno one could be found to share a cabin with the assistant director of the Fort Isabelle leper hospital\u201d (13). He is accordingly one of Foucault\u2019s technicians from Discipline & Punish, and notes, very weirdly, that \u201cthe world was not without those who, for their own reasons, wished to catch the disease\u201d (id.). (Huh?) (Difficult to resist the impulse to quote Foucault at length on leprosy and juxtapose those comments with Coke\u2019s comments on heresy\u2014but am resisting the temptation.)Forest where principal events occur is a \u201clandscape without time\u201d (14), wherein physician might \u201cbe free from the questions of motive and identity that were bound up with his sense of time and the past\u201d (15). Some suggestion in this connection that \u201chis reasons for serving at the leper hospital were not altogether humanitarian, and that he might be more attracted by the idea of leprosy, and whatever it unconsciously represented\u201d (17). That\u2019s all because he was having an affair with one of his colleagues, of course (id.). Plot is set into motion by her letter to him, \u201cwith its strange and ecstatic vision of the forest\u2014in maculoanesthetic leprosy there was an involvement of nervous tissue\u201d (id.), causing him to seek her out. In any other novel, this might be a decent enough premise for a story: I go to rescue my lover from the leprosarium amid colonial space and its chronic peril. But because it\u2019s JG Ballard, that\u2019s not good enough. No, we need an apocalyptic confrontation; we don\u2019t get out of bed unless the world is ending in the JGB, yo. It fits the normal JGB story, which is deproletarianized: \u201cthere is hardly anyone there at all. Most of the workers have left\u201d (24). What\u2019s left then, as in High Rise, say, or The Drowned World, is an apocalypse for the professionals and proprietors. (Dude summons the spectres of these texts with comments on how \u201cmy belief that this illuminated forest in some way reflects an earlier period in our lives, perhaps an archaic memory we are born with of some ancestral paradise where the unity of time and space is the signature of every leaf and flower\u201d (74)\u2014dunno if that\u2019s some kinda ugly subornost-type thesis or other pre-modern proto-fascistic insistence on illiberal unity of atavistic tribes or what\u2014but JGB just can\u2019t stop himself.) Am not sure if this means that in JGB only the upper class is a worthy subject of analysis, or, more precisely, if in JGB the apocalyptic only happens to the elite\u2014if so, it\u2019s almost as though this is a corollary to the standard robot narrative, wherein slave laborers have a revolution against the humans. Here, the slave laborers simply absent themselves and the world ends. Both are variants that fear socialist revolution, which is encoded in Marxism as their Gotterdammerung. Hatless shrugged, I guess. Despite the repeated insistence that various areas are \u201cdeserted\u201d (e.g., 50, 65, &c.), the text thinks however that the apocalypse is progressive vitrification, which is drawn into concordance with leprosy: \u201cthis business here and your own specialty are very similar. In a way, one is the dark side of the other. I\u2019m thinking of the silver scales of leprosy that give the disease its name\u201d (58). Dubbed \u201cthe Hubble Effect,\u201d progressive vitrification of Earth is \u201ccloser to a cancer than anything else\u2014and about as curable\u2014an actual proliferation of the sub-atomic identity of all matter. It\u2019s as if a sequence of displaced but identical images of the same object were being produced by refraction through a prism, but with the element of time replacing the role of light\u201d (59-60). Get that?Sadly, \u201cthe real crisis is long past\u201d (75). Everyone ignored the marginal news of \u201cthe sighting of another \u2018double galaxy\u2019\u201d at the Hubble Institute (id.). Somehow, \u201cwithout doubt, these random transfigurations throughout the world are a reflection of distant cosmic processes of enormous scope and dimensions, first glimpsed in the Andromeda spiral\u201d (id.). Without doubt! It\u2019s not really intergalactic invaders, but more that time is the villain: \u201cThe recent discovery of anti-matter in the universe inevitably involves the conception of anti-time as the fourth side of the negatively charged continuum. Where anti-particle and particle collide they not only destroy their own physical identities, but their opposing time-values eliminate each other, subtracting from the universe another quantum from its total store of time\u201d (id.). Somehow this causes a depletion of time on Earth (?), \u201cso the super-saturation of matter in our continuum leads to its appearance in a parallel spatial matrix,\u201d i.e., the \u201ccrystalline mass\u201d (75-76). But it is \u201csubstance without mass\u201d (76), and it is apparently possible for \u201ca single atom to produce an infinite number of duplicates of itself and so fill the entire universe, from which simultaneously all time has expired, an ultimate macrocosmic zero beyond the wildest dreams of Plato and Democritus\u201d (76). Okay, that\u2019s kinda cool, and, in some ways, the setting\u2019s process is something of a parmenideanization of the world, the unchanging aletheia come to Earth to destroy its heraclitean polemos: indeed, \u201cafter the endless glimmer of the vitrified forest the trees along the road, the ruined hotel and even the two men with him appeared to be shadowy images of themselves, replicas of illuminated originals in some distant land\u201d (107-08).All this stuff is just leprosy, though, which, \u201clike cancer, is above all a disease of time, a result of over-extending oneself through that particular medium\u201d (77). Settng\u2019s mystery settled halfway, the remainder of the narrative is the standard JGB traipsing off into barbarian space to hoard women. Here, mine owner has some other dude\u2019s wife set up in his chateaux, \u201cfearing that she might die, he preferred this half-animate immolation within the crystal vaults to her physical death in the world outside\u201d (102). Sanders\u2019 own love interest at the leprosarium upon their reunion has \u201ca facial rictus caused by the nodular thickening of the upper lip,\u201d with \u201cnodular lumps all over her face and in the lobe of her left ear,\u201d the \u201cso-called leonine mask\u201d (113).Sanders\u2019 anagnorisis comes late, when he realizes that \u201cby some optical or electromagnetic freak, the intense focus of light within the stones simultaneously produced a compression of time, so that the discharge of light from the surfaces reversed the process of crystallization\u201d (134). It was \u201cthis gift of time which accounted for the eternal appeal of precious gems\u201d (id.). I guess this makes the novel an advertisement for Blood Diamonds. That snark aside, it leads novel to its best insight: Their intricate crests and cartouches, occupying more than their own volume of space, so seemed to contain a greater ambient time, providing that unmistakable premonition of immortality sensed within St. Peter\u2019s or the palace at Nymphenburg. By contrast, the architecture of the twentieth century, characteristically one of the rectangular unornamented facades, of simple Euclidean space and time, was that of the New World, confident in its firm footing in the future and indifferent to those pangs of mortality which haunted the mind of old Europe.(134-35). It\u2019s not everyday that someone actually invokes Lovecraft\u2019s non-Euclidean architectures and provides a fairly plausible explanation. I can almost understand what Lovecraft means now, sorta\u2014so this novel works also as a gloss on Lovecraft.Recommended for readers joined together in the last marriage of space and time, those who are neither animate nor inanimate, and persons in an armor of diamonds."}, {"userName": "Mark McGinty", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3900446-mark-mcginty", "userReview": "SpellbindingThis is an interesting piece of literature, not quite a fantasy story, but not quite within the bounds of reality. The characters are normal people, the setting is a small town with nothing special about it, except that it is beside a jungle where jewels grow out of the ground like weeds, and as a tumor, overtake anyone or anything in their way. If you can find your way out, before becoming a frozen statue of gems, the crystals melt away as you cross an invisible threshold. It's mesmerizing, and out of this world.What I liked most, is that Ballard never offers an explanation for this garden of jewelry. The rather simple story takes our characters on adventures in and out of this jungle, where some move swiftly enough to make it through with only a thin layer of \"frost\" on their clothes, while others find themselves trapped, and eventually buried under a rising ocean of diamonds and sapphires.The prose is simply wonderful. Ballard is a master of language. It is a joy to find yourself tangled in the elegance of his wording, so simple and so fluid, yet as enchanting as the jewels of his strange, dreamlike jungle.If you are looking to read a story with a clear, structured plot, where event A leads to event B and is resolved by event C, then avoid this book. This does not build up to a climactic revelation, and the mystery is not solved by a dramatic courtroom confession. But if you're hoping to find yourself lost in another world, then imagine the possibilities of a place where you can fill your pockets with opals and rubies, and where lepers grow emerald limbs glazed with topaz!

So many things are wrong with this book. In it, you'll find the sexism and racism you'd expect from this era and this genre. The main character is a dull block of wood with no personality, almost a complete lack of motivation, and no visible character arc. The supporting cast are all one-dimensional. It even fails as science fiction: the main idea is that somehow (?) some kind of time crystals are forming in a jungle somewhere, the author waves his hands about this representing some primordial something or other, and the whole things ends with almost no purpose except to make the main character say some \"poetic\" things. As science fiction, this reads like a rejected Star Trek script.That's the final straw: the main draw for this book seems to be its prose and the poetry in the description of the \"crystal world\", and I'm here to tell you that it's not any good. I never thought being led through a forest made of crystal and jewels could be so boring.At some point the author drops any attempt to convey theme through the events of the book and has our main character make a half-hearted attempt at finding a vague theme of duality in the events of the book.

Man facing various disasters and apocalypses is a common theme Ballard visits again and again but never are we ever able to effectively fight against nature, to overcome its inexplicable shifts. For Ballard, it is more about how we come to terms with change, how we come to accept nature and our place in it.For all that, there is something about his writing that doesn't sit well with me. I am never be fully at ease with the way he writes, never quite gel with his style. I can see why many people like him a lot but I guess it is something personal, a kind of barrier.

Some may think that makes me seem uneducated or simple; people who feel that way can continue to feel that way because their opinion is irrelevant. When I read an author that is trying this hard to use impressive language at the expense of even halfway-decent storytelling? That's a wrap. And honestly, nothing happens in this book. There's not even any internal monologue. Ballard may as well be describing, in extreme depth, a trip to a supermarket. Yeah, the idea of areas in the world slowly transforming into crystal is a novel one, but it's one that would be better executed as a short story with a really good editor.
