Read this book. Love wild, mind-trip movies like Inception? Read this book. If you\u2019re looking for a smart, entertaining, and psychologically hard-hitting novel, this is what it looks like. READ THIS BOOK.Touch was, in a word, fascinating. \u201cHave you been losing time?\u201d I don\u2019t think I can ever hear or read this phrase again without getting a shiver down my spine. Imagine, if you will, a group or species of near-immortal people (they call themselves \u201cGhosts\u201d) that can jump from body to body, taking their hosts over and seeing through their eyes, feeling what they feel. They can choose to be anyone they want, live any life they want\u2026and all it takes is a single touch \u2013 and JUMP. Whether the possession is for two seconds, two days, or twenty years, the hosts won\u2019t remember after the Ghost jumps away to another body again. Have you ever looked at your cellphone and see a call you don\u2019t remember making? Or found yourself somewhere, without knowing how you got there? Have. You. Ever. Lost. Time?Our protagonist is one of these Ghosts, given the name \u201cKepler\u201d. The story begins with Kepler dying in her/his latest body Josephine Cebula, gunned down in a Turkish Metro station by a man who is clearly aware of Kepler\u2019s nature and unique abilities. Kepler jumps bodies in pursuit of the mysterious killer hoping to get answers, and ends up wearing the killer\u2019s body itself. Someone or some organization has been hunting down and destroying the Ghosts, and Kepler is determined to find the truth and avenge her/his beloved Josephine.This book is getting lots of love from me based on the inventiveness and ingenuity of the premise alone. It\u2019s especially a great read if you enjoy what-if stories and thought experiments, though imagining possible scenarios based on the theories in this novel might take you places you don\u2019t want to go. Imagine being an unwilling victim of a Ghost, waking up having no idea where you are, with these people you don\u2019t know who claim to be your children, finding out it\u2019s suddenly twenty years later, and the last thing you remember is shaking hands with a stranger \u2013 a lifetime ago. Imagine the violation and trauma of knowing someone else had been in your body, using it doing God knows what. Imagine the memories and experiences you\u2019ll never get the chance to have, because precious time was stolen from you.Some Ghosts give very little thought to their hosts but Kepler is different, having cherished her/his hosts through all the centuries he/she has been jumping bodies. But everyone, even Ghosts, have their limits when pushed, and will do anything it takes to stay alive. At times, Kepler might come across as selfish and callous, but these situations only arise when he/she feels threatened and cornered. Small consolation for the victims who lose their lives because of Kepler\u2019s actions, perhaps, but it does make me think slightly better of her/him.This book reads like a mystery for the most part, relying on the unknown and strategically dropped hints to keep the plot moving evenly along, though it also has a handful of the most memorable action sequences I\u2019ve ever read. Claire North makes good use of a Ghost\u2019s body-jumping talents, almost taking them to gimmicky heights, to write some insanely good gunfight scenes. Just think about it. Yes, they are as awesome as you can imagine.Of course, it also wouldn\u2019t be such a unique book if it didn\u2019t present its own set of potential problems. There will be moments of confusion, and it can\u2019t be helped. The narrative jumps around a lot because of the constant body switching. There are flashback chapters that help us understand the main character, but they can also break up the pacing and slow things down. The story builds and builds and gets so complicated at times that it stumbles over itself. But for me, all that is a small price to pay for such an incredible and original story. As always, YMMV!All told, Touch was a delightful surprise. Above all, I adored the concept and I think this would make an excellent movie, if only someone could pull it off (quick, someone send a copy to Christopher Nolan!) Thrilling, imaginative and entertaining, this book kept me reading well into the night."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "This book deserves five stars for originality alone. I suppose from the author who created the blue electric Angels and who wrote about a man who had fifteen lives I could have expected something equally bizarre and fantastic. And I certainly got that and more. I am not sure what to call the entity which is the main character but I know I want to be one. His/her (it depends) ability to switch bodies is just delightful and the author has the details all sorted. Little things like how you deal with objects such as your room key when you can't take it with you made me smile. Touch has everything I like in a book, likeable characters, humorous dialogue as well as fast paced action, some supernatural effects and excellent writing. Loved it."}, {"userName": "Ferdy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4596358-ferdy", "userReview": "SpoilersHated this. Crap story, crap characters, crap relationships, crap everything. What I loathed most about Touch was the main character (Kepler), he was a complete an utter bitch, everything he said or did or thought pissed me off. -I was intrigued by the premise of 'ghosts' who no longer had a body of their own and could only live by jumping from one person to the other. For some reason or another I expected loads of depth, ambiguity and complexity, but I got none of that. The characters were flat, their wisdom and experiences were super cheesy, and the story had no layers, twists or turns. All of it was ridiculously boring and repetitive.-It was never revealed whether Kepler was male or female, to me he came across more as male as he occupied male bodies more/for longer, and the way he died before he was a 'ghost' suggested that he may have been a man. Hence, why I'm referring to Kepler as he.-So Kepler turned into a 'ghost' when he was on the verge of death and he reached out to his murderer so he wouldn't die alone (rolls eyes) and somehow touching him caused Kepler to jump into his body. It was never properly explained how Kepler became a 'ghost', apparently it just happened because he died violently, there was no satisfying explanation to it, it was nonsensical. -In the 250 years as a ghost Kepler jumped around in whatever body took his fancy and lived their life, sometimes he asked their permission and sometimes he just stole hours/days/weeks/years off of people. I suspect Kepler occasionally asking permission to borrow bodies was meant to show how much he cared about the bodies/people he wore, but if anything it just showed what a vulture he was because he only ever targeted vulnerable people who he more or less blackmailed into saying yes. So his whole I-care-and-love-the-bodies-I-use-and-abuse felt like a lie. He didn't do anything useful in the bodies, he didn't really help people or try to make the world a better place, he just did what he wanted and then left and went onto his next victim. For some bizarre reason Kepler genuinely seemed to think he was some sort of upstanding guy and he happily judged and lectured everyone around him like he himself was a saint. I really didn't feel anything but hate for him, he was nothing but a parasite, him banging on about his love for other people didn't convince me otherwise.-The book started with an assassin (Coyle) shooting Kepler (who was in the body of a prostitute called Josephine). Naturally, selfish Kepler escaped into another body and watched Josephine get shot at again and again until she died. I found it funny how Kepler claimed he loved Josephine when he did absolutely nothing to help her when she was being shot at, he just hid and saved himself and then whined about her dying. He didn't feel guilty or sorry that she was dead because of him, it was always someone else's fault. Anyway, he then jumped into Coyle's body and traveled all over Europe/Asia, whilst dodging bad guys and bitching about other countries/cities/people. The prick.-There was so much travelling and descriptions of random places, every chapter seemed to take place somewhere new. The majority of the book was just Kepler/Coyle travelling here, there, and everywhere - there was more page time on transport and whatever new city Kepler/Coyle found themselves in than actual story. I didn't care what Kepler thought about Berlin or L.A or Tunisia or wherever, especially when most of his remarks were condescending and smug. Parts of the book felt more like a bloody travel memoir than anything else, it was ridiculous.-Absolutely hated Kepler, he was a thoroughly unsympathetic character, not to mention extremely dull. I can't remember the last time I hated a character as much as I hated this fucker. Was I meant to be rooting for him?! No fucking way. He was a selfish parasite who robbed people of their lives, destroyed bodies and caused nothing but death and chaos wherever he went. It was bad enough when he was possessing people who agreed to it and knew what the score was, but him jumping into bodies without permission was unforgivable. He stole years from people and never felt any guilt or remorse for taking things he had no right to or for putting them in danger. I especially hated when he mentioned possessing students who were starting their first year of uni, he acted like he was doing them a favour by stealing their education and university experiences. According to him they would have half-assed it anyway and ended up with an STD. Even if that was the case it still didn't make it okay to steal such an important part of their lives. Also, who was he to assume anything? How did he know they weren't passionate and excited about learning and being away from home? What a fucker taking something so life changing from someone just because it was easier to possess a student who was away from home than anyone else. Then there was him marrying and having families in someone else's body, there was no care for what the person would do or how they would feel when he left and they 'woke up' without any memory and found they had kids and a whole life they knew nothing about. There was no thought for anyone but himself. Ugh, I wouldn't have minded Kepler as much if he wasn't written as if he was the good guy but because he was written that way, I couldn't stand him.-I don't know why Kepler thought he had a right to live when his very presence ruined multiple lives in a ton of different ways. Anyone he came into contact with suffered in some way or another, but even that didn't make him stop or change his ways, he just swaggered about like he had a right to everything and everyone. He was utterly vile.-One thing that really bugged me about Kepler was him acting like he was the person he was possessing, he kept saying he was so and so whenever he occupied a new body, when in actual fact he was just himself and the person he'd taken over was no longer there. His delusion that he was the person who he possessed was just a way for him to absolve himself of stealing other people's lives.-I didn't buy Kepler's mission or determination to track down Josephine's killers. He acted like he loved her and that he was oh so angry at what happened her, but that was utter bullshit when he happily left her to suffer and die and jumped out of her body the first chance he got all so he could save himself. He was a total coward, and it was hard to believe he cared about her when he only really remembered her when he was trying to punish Coyle and guilt him for his actions, he mostly forgot about her otherwise.-It irked me how Kepler played the victim when he was responsible for so much death and hurt all so he could selfishly live more than the 250 years he'd already lived. He never once apologised for the mess he created, if he was really as nice as he claimed he would have sacrificed himself long ago so he could stop ruining lives. But nope, he carried on like normal despite knowing he would wreck more lives in the future. He was judgmental, self righteous, dangerous and hypocritical, yet he banged on and on like he was some kind of tortured hero. It was infuriating how he managed to dodge death so much, it was clear we were meant to root for him but I sided more with the bad guys than him. I was rooting for Kepler to be killed painfully and slowly, I was hoping that would happen by the end, but the fucker escaped leaving behind loads of death and chaos. Ugh.-Really liked the Antonina/Duke memory Kepler recalled, that was actually quite moving. All Kepler's other memories of taking over other people's lives were hollow, selfish and dull.-Galileo's character was beyond ridiculous, he was so one note and over the top with his cliched brand of craziness. He still managed to be more likeable than Kepler though, at least Galileo didn't pretend to be a good guy. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone, it was absolutely rubbish in every way. One of the worst books I've read this year."}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "I think I've found my next go-to artist for must have reading material.\"Do you like what you see?\"This is like an ultramodern retelling of a vain girl's obsession with appearance versus what belongs solidly beneath the veneer. Of course, how else could you see life when you're without a real body, except those that you steal on contact and flit from norm to norm?Kepler was truly devoted to doing right by her hosts and loved them in her best way, but she (or he) was always superficial. Janus, on the other hand, eventually moved away from his (or her) obsession with outward beauty to dive right into what really matters deep within, but still failed to get it right.Galileo, on the other hand, never desired or understood the journey, and made a pure mockery of the outward form, eventually becoming northing more than a child that throws away people (in murder) as a spoiled child would mutilate her dolls, with as much care.The characters are deep and change throughout the novel, and I love them all, but especially our heaviest soul, Kepler. I simultaneously enjoyed the repetition of the need for revenge and got very tired of it. The feel of the novel needed the reminder every once in a while, certainly, because it might have been lost in the everyday progression of survival in the middle of running, but even if I believe it could have been handled better, I damn well don't have a better suggestion beyond what was already done. I still liked every aspect of this tale.Cole really grew on me, as did the Aquarius group, even if the group was never particularly likeable. The snippets of past and history made me believe, from my deepest heart of hearts, that our dear author is a great student of history.I fell into the flashbacks as if I were in the ocean, made to ride the waves of time like the gentlest susurrations of water and motion. I really enjoyed the way I was pushed back and forth, and that's high praise because I never really enjoy flashbacks at all.This novel is a success. If you come into it wanting to have a F/SF tale of love as can only be told by separate embodiments of a mind/body dichotomy, then you're going to get a real treat.There are no real similarities in plot and historical exploration in regard to The Fifteen Lives of Harry August, but a bit deeper below the surface, it's easy to tell that she's in the same zone. Relationships with others are super important, even when the sense of alienation is paramount. These are damn full of non-repeating discussions of it, and I am left in awe at the damn polished prose.

Claire North is brilliant ok?Kepler is a \"ghost\", an entity that can inhabit humans and supplant the existing intelligence to \"wear\" them. It can stay for seconds, days, years or a lifetime before moving on, leaving bewilderment behind. Ghosts seem to be able to live forever by just moving between bodies, and their personality is varied, from mostly ethical as Kepler is today, to morally dubious as we see in flashbacks to earlier lives, to outright insane in the case of some of the others we encounter in this book.The story starts with the attempted assassination of Kepler and his current host, which is very unusual. The story of the deep relationships between Kepler, the people trying to kill him/her and the other ghosts that get involved is fascinating and ranges all over Europe and the US. All broken up by details from Kepler's previous lives (a bit like the structure of The Lives of Tao, but snappier, and like all of North's writing, beautifully done.Kepler's complex and evolving morality, that of essentially a parasite, is fascinating. One illuminating point is that unlike other ghosts, Kepler doesn't call itself that. That's a name given to it by the assassins chasing it, and it really doesn't like it. The name it always goes by is the name of it's current host. There's also the claim constantly made that it loves its hosts, and it's clear that it considers them beautiful even if that beauty can be hard to find.Beyond the fantastical elements, and the morality play, this is a brilliant take on the fugitive story, with both special quarry and special hunters. It's also action and tension-packed.Highly recommended and possibly my favorite from this author to date (but I always say that)."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma", "userReview": "3.5 stars.

Basic questions \u2013 name, age, father\u2019s name, mother\u2019s name, university \u2013 can be answered by any well-informed inhabitant, but it takes a matter of minutes to probe a little deeper.\"Kepler is a ghost. Kepler is a thief. And Kepler has worn many, many lives.Once, Kepler had a name and a body \u2013 but at the point of violent death so many centuries ago on the streets of London, Kepler is one of the few souls that takes solace in the names and bodies of others. Like other so-called ghosts, one touch of the flesh, and Kepler assumes a host\u2019s identity \u2013 their bodies, their time, their lives.And Kepler has stolen many, many lives.Over the years, Kepler has been a medical student and a prominent politician; a prostitute and a model. Kepler has been young, beautiful, elderly, male, female, healthy, and diseased. Kepler has taken bodies by force and with the willing consent of its host \u2013 in Kepler\u2019s latest incarnation, the host is a willing young woman named Josephine, with a hard past. But on the crowded platform of a train station, Josephine is shot twice in the chest, once in the leg, with bullets meant to kill the ghost. An assassin is hunting Kepler and Kepler\u2019s kind \u2013 an organization bent on eradicating ghosts, with detailed dossiers on the lives Kepler has assumed\u2026 and the supposed murders that Kepler has committed.On the run, desperate for answers, for justice for Josephine, for the right to live, Kepler tracks down its hunters \u2013 and finds that nothing is what it seems.\u201cI walk through people\u2019s lives and I steal what I find. Their bodies, their time, their money, their friends, their lovers, their wives\u2014I\u2019ll take it all, if I want to.\"Thought-provoking. Existential. Poignant. These are all words that describe Claire North\u2019s luminescent Touch. This is the second novel from North (a pseudonym for author Catherine Webb, who also writes urban fantasy under the name Kate Griffin), following her incredibly well-received and much-loved 2014 book The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August. Like Harry August, Touch\u2018s Kepler is an immortal, unique protagonist \u2013 and it is largely because of Touch\u2018s protagonist that the novel truly works.I was drawn to Touch because of the novel\u2019s premise \u2013 the idea of an untethered soul, jumping and stealing the consciousness of any body is fascinating and comes loaded with important, complex questions of free will, identity, and the fundamental essence of self. It\u2019s not a new conceit or a particularly unique one \u2013 from vampires, to demonic possession, to body-snatching aliens, North employs familiar horror tropes here.1 But Touch stands out because of its careful, beautiful prose, and its cautious, monstrous, yet wholly sympathetic protagonist.\"You must travel light when you wear another\u2019s skin.Everything you own belongs to someone else.Everything you value you must leave behind.It is not I who made a family.It is not I who have a home.It is someone else, whose face I borrowed for a little while, whose life I lived and who now may live the life I lived as I move on.\"Let\u2019s talk about Kepler.2 A ghost who can hijack a host body in an instant, Kepler is unequivocally, unapologetically, a monster. In order to live, Kepler must assume a body; Kepler makes no excuses for choosing to live. The sympathy in Kepler\u2019s character, however, is that we see this ghost has a kind of code. Through North\u2019s skillful prose and alternating present-past life flashbacks, we learn that Kepler is not the mass murderer or serial killer that the Aquarius Group believes it to be. We read of a ghost who is cautious, measured, and calculating; one who, when the situation is right, even attempts to make the lives of its hosts better (however misguided and immoral that decision may be). For Josephine Cebula, this is enduring the withdrawals from intravenous drugs and offering her a chance at wealth and a fresh start; for Maria Anna Celeste Jones, a different woman from a different time, it is offering a chance of revenge for the rapes and abuses wrought by a corrupt and powerful politician. Make no mistake, Kepler is no saint and every transaction comes at a cost \u2013 but beyond basic, even the \u201cgood\u201d deeds the ghost plants are rife with questionable morality. When one is a body thief, stealing the time, the identities, the very lives of its hosts, it\u2019s hard to moralize or support the rationalizations of the thief. When one such as Kepler takes on the role of \u201cestate agent\u201d and does the dirty work for other ghosts, so that they can easily slide into the bodies, lives of their dream hosts, it\u2019s even harder to sympathize with such a character.Somehow, however, North pulls it off.Perhaps this is because we, as readers, are exposed to other ghosts in the course of Touch. We read Kepler\u2019s horror and pain at losing Josephine, Kepler\u2019s outrage at the injustice of that unnecessary death. In contrast, we are introduced to other ghosts: Janus, who seemingly flits from pretty, rich, privileged body to body. Aurangzeb, the childish, whining ghost who yearns for fame and glory. Galileo, the true murderer, driven mad over the millennia. North\u2019s ghosts are fickle, capricious, god-like creatures who play with the lives of mortals not just because they can, but because they have no other choice. It is the way the ghost interacts with its mortal audience that makes all the difference. This is Kepler\u2019s story, and Kepler\u2019s strength.\"We fall in love too easily, ghosts such as I.\"There is little not to love in Touch. The writing is beautiful, the questions it raises about mortality and morality are striking. Although the book\u2019s ending tends towards overly-sentimental, there is no doubt in my mind that Touch is one of the best books I\u2019ve read all year. It\u2019s a contender for a top 10 book of 2015, and I\u2019ll be rushing out to get my copy of The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August immediately.Absolutely recommended, for the monster in all of us."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36549125-william", "userReview": "Brilliant, imaginative, unusual! A wonderful and terrible monster deeply examined and presented. Claire North has again (after Harry August) proven her vision and originality, and her discipline in bringing such unusual characters to vivid life. The rhythm of her prose is marvellous. It was so good to sink into her writing again!Here, her immortal monster-parasite struggles between the fear of death and the cost to others of her life. So many aspects of life as such an entity are deeply examined by North. To be such a creature stealing moments or minutes from people's lives is to be a thief. To live as a monster stealing months or years is the most cruel of assaults, a kind of murder. Indeed, we see one victim whose entire adult life has been stolen for decades, leaving him a broken old man. Truly monstrous. North's careful examination and consideration of these issues is the very best aspect of this book. Wonderful!The pacing is very good and twists in the story are clever and satisfying. At only one point did I feel that a plot shortcut was pressed on the reader, but it was brief and only a bump in the road.The action sequences are wonderfully confusing, as the viewpoint switches at a maddening pace. Just as in Harry August, North again imagines an ancient daydream of human minds and brings it to vibrant, fascinating life!Well done!"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23841736-sarah", "userReview": "Wow, this book was every bit as brilliant as I remembered! It's very fast paced and I got so caught up in the momentum that I simply could not put it down. I had to tell the world to shut up and go away for half an hour. North is particularly adept at describing the transitions from person to person and her descriptions of the hundred or so people Kepler lands in focus on minutiae that would not be noticeable to someone who was existing in the body. Kepler feels a great deal of love for the skins she wears and given the way that the people are described each time, you get an excellent sense of just how much Kepler loves humans in general.The story starts with one of Kepler's skins being murdered by someone who is trying to kill Kepler. She begins to investigate what is going on and over the course of the story we get a look at the many lives she's lived over many years.

Solid 5 stars through and through.So brilliant, so beautiful, and absolutely breathtaking. I have no words for what I am feeling right now after having just turned the last page. And now that this book is over, I am utterly lost. Why couldn't it be longer? Why isn't there more? And yet it ended on such a perfect note. I haven't read a plot coming together this succinctly in a while, so I am currently basking in the brilliance of all the pieces falling into place.An immortal entity called Kepler has the ability to jump from body to body and take over it completely. He becomes that person for a period of time and lives their life--works their job, interacts with their friends and family, drives their car, wears their clothes, spends their money--and then he jumps to another body when he's done with that life or gets bored. And he's been doing it for centuries. He's lived a multitude of lives, as men, as women, old, young, rich, poor, and everything in between.And then one day, while in a new body and enjoying the novelty of the new body, he is gunned down on the street. Right after he is shot though, he jumps into this killer's body and takes it over. What follows is an intense, white-knuckle race across Europe to find out who is out to kill him. To do so, he has to work backwards starting with his killer's identity and working back to his associates and all their tangled connections and then all the way back to the person who hired him. Each leg of the journey reveals something shocking about himself, all the lives he's lived, all the people he's known, and the person who's after him.Kepler is... hard to define and not a character you could easily root for. He's also a lot of things, but at the core, he is selfish. He wants to live and continue living, at the expense of the people whose lives he takes over. All his actions and motivations are aimed at this simple truth: he wants to live. This precisely why I find him totally believable as an immortal. He may be selfish, but at least he's honest about his selfishness and will to live. He makes no excuses because he has this need that drives him to live life to the fullest and experience all that life has to offer, even when it's someone else's life and he is just borrowing it for the moment.Most of the immortals in books I've read never achieve this level of selfishness or honesty. They were all too human in their wants and needs. Some even went as far as giving up their immortality for love. (Yes, for love... and that's\u00a0totally believable because... reasons?) Kepler though is utterly, single-mindedly a glutton for life, and he lives in such a way that makes you want to life your life to its fullest potential.Aside from brilliant, this book is also slippery, difficult to grasp and even more difficult hang onto. It took over\u00a0my every waking moment for the past week and a half and yet it feels like no time has passed at all. It feels like I inhaled a whole new world in one sitting, and now I am slowly returning to mine and feeling as though something is missing, as though there is a hole the exact shape of this book missing from my life and it's a weighty kind of absence. The remedy for that is to read more Claire North, and I will soon, but not just yet. I'm not ready to move on away from this book yet. This book hangover needs to linger and work itself out before I can move on.Claire North is a genius, which comes as no surprise to me since I know her from her Kate Griffin days with the brilliant and brilliantly satisfying urban fantasy series Matthew Swift. But this book is something else altogether. Very different, very unexpected, an all-consuming experience I was not ready for. And yet, it has Kate Griffin's fingerprints in the details. So familiar and welcoming, it's like coming home again. No one can make cities, lifetimes, and urban magic come alive like she can.Meticulously written, beautifully executed. Every word, every line has a purpose. No space wasted. No time wasted. I loved everything about this book.\u201cNothing is ever quite enough.

No matter who you are, there\u2019s always something more to be had, which could be yours if only you were someone else.\u201d Feeling a bit perplexed...On one hand, I absolutely loved this novel, especially the idea at its core of 'ghosts' inhabiting people's bodies as skins, jumping from one person to another on a whim. Not only is it gripping, catching your attention pretty quickly on, but it raises many questions too (identity and gender the most obvious), such as what makes these entities 'tick' when nothing that we value is relevant to them. Considering all this, North succeeds in portraying Kepler and indeed the others in a very effective way. The thriller aspect is very well handled too, with a break-neck race through Europe, actions scenes, but also slower, more reflective and poignant sections.However... I did find it sometimes really hard to connect with some of the skins and their stories, which is weird because they were all interesting. I guess having a main character that doesn't just inhabit a person, but takes on their attributes, can be confusing? I'm at a loss.Anyway, on the whole a very good read :O)"}, {"userName": "Robyn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25037254-robyn", "userReview": "An innovative concept (though I was enjoying comparing it to The Lives of Tao), and extremely fast-pacing make for an enthralling novel.

She was brilliant when she did her reading, came across incredibly well, and she made me want to buy her book instantly...so I did. I got the audio version of this one because after hearing her read aloud from the story it was clear that this would be a book that would work so much better in audio form because of the vast range of people and characters that the main character encounters and becomes.We follow Kepler, a ghost, an entity, someone who has lived many, many lives over. Kepler has an ability where they can transfer their consciousness into other bodies just through touch, and they are able to live as little or as long as they want to inside that person, provided they can build anew or learn the life that person has. There were so many elements of this book that worked so very well for me. It's exciting, it's fast, it's chaotic and yet, there is a real sense of longing and love as a deep undertone to the story. We follow Kepler, but we also follow all of the hosts that Kepler encounters. Each person has their own story, their own life, and way to live it. The raw ability to suss things out about the hosts, or the interesting ways that Kepler discovered things, was a constant source of interest to me. It was a thoroughly interesting concept that kept me guessing.I have to say I think the power that Kepler and the others of its kind possess is deadly. It's SO powerful because it's easy to hide, easy to change, easy to swap into another person. Some of the chase scenes and buy traffic rush hour scenes in this book worked brilliantly because we experience the people that Kepler meets in flashes and emotions rather than as individuals. I honestly feel like this was such a good writing technique and t really fleshed out the complexity and destructive capabilities of the power. The story itself is probably a thriller with SFF elements if I was to give it a 'genre'. It would certainly appeal to a wider audience than just genre readers, but it's also bringing something incredibly new and fresh to the world of SFF. Personally, I think the pseudonym of Clair North (actually Cat Webber who also goes by Kate Griffin) works incredibly effectively here to broaden the appeal and break out of genre norms.There are plenty of little quirks that I liked a whole lot. The idea of Estate Agents who had to do all the back story researching on the bodies that entities may have to inhabit was very well considered. I feel lie it's a fantastically crazy but brilliant power... you could literally rule the world and yet everyone would think that you were just being you, so long as you do your research. I think that the story of this book is pretty exciting too. We first meet Kepler inside the body of Josaphine, a young woman who has agreed to share her body for a price and a set amount of time. Josaphine and Kepler's relationship is unique and different, and when Josaphine/Kepler is shot and Josaphine is left for dead whilst Kepler transfers to a new host and lives, it leads Kepler to a quest to uncover who is hunting them and why...I feel like this is a book I could definitely recommend to a whole lot of people. I think it would certainly appeal to most, and it's a quick, fun and easy read. I gave it a 4.5*s in the end and I am very keen to experience more of North's work in the near future as I do own The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August and I anticipate buying many more of her works soon.

It just feels pretentious, and I soon got bored of superficial action and the novelty of the narrative. Give me plot, conflict, characters, stakes! Not just cheap thrills.Initially, I found it confusing. It\u2019s not just that the character jumps from body to body, but the narrative jumps around too so that it\u2019s hard to find north. The first few chapters almost refuse to introduce the story. Instead, a confusion tactic is deployed in the hopes that the more lost you feel, the more intrigued you\u2019ll be. That\u2019s a cheap trick. Interesting? Maybe in bits, but not without effort and you can forget the full picture. I started to think maybe the book would never take on the qualities of an actual novel. It starts to take form after a while, but it still never makes it to a point where I could actually enjoy it.There were parts that just didn\u2019t seem logical to me. At one point the main character knows a person is going to get attacked so they jump into their body and then makes a comment akin to \u2018Why are they even attacking me?\u2019 Well, it\u2019s because you decided to jump into a body which was about to be attacked.

Are they still them or do they just sleep for a longer than usual time?The perspective changes were fascinating to me and the sense that part of your physical nature drives your personality. After centuries of experience, Kepler seems to slip into character by gaining clues from the physical situation he finds himself in (yes I think of Kepler as male), has the body been taken care of, does it wear nice clothes, what are in the pockets/purse/briefcase? I loved the surprise he had when he left a certain body that he had used to speak Arabic based on his outward appearance and other clues, only to find that the person spoke fluid French.Are the ghosts more important than humans because of their wealth of knowledge and experience or are the humans more special and unique because they have fewer choices?

Principally more thriller than fantasy, North engages in a thought experiment about what the existence is like for an entity that can only exist by inhabiting the physical bodies of humans (skins) and can only experience the senses (sight, smell, taste, touch, hear) through these bodies. These \"ghosts\" are born through vicious acts of violence upon their corporeal bodies and they live for hundreds of years by transferring from body to body by touching skin. They only way for them to perish is by the body they inhabit dying before they can transfer to another.\u00a0North explores some very interesting concepts including the nature of love, the nature of our soul, what makes us who we are? Is it our appearance, our physical bodies, our personal philosophies and perceptions of morality? Of self? Of others? How important is beauty and our perception of beauty to our internal make-up? Is the pursuit of our concept perfection what drive us? How close we come to attaining that what makes us happy? All of these ponderings are wrapped up in the format of a chase thriller in which it would seem after years of existence, these entities/ghosts too can go insane.I enjoyed this story which (in general) was a different kind of book for me. I'm not quite convinced that North was as successful in her exploration of the philosophical concepts. I thought the novel was both too long and not long enough. I think some depth was sacrificed for the thriller aspects of the novel. Frankly the thriller parts were becoming tedious while I found myself longing for deeper, more meaningful explorations of the concepts of love and beauty. Still, this novel was extremely thought provoking and I will definitely be reading more from North.

The entity known to his/her/its enemies as Kepler has been around for quite some time. And Kepler is not the only entity of this type: a ghost who can move from body to body by touch. Carefully done, this can happen with minimal disruption to lives; of course, long term hosts will find their lives much changed, although Kepler tries to leave them significantly better off. But just as Kepler is settling into a mutually beneficial arrangement with Josephine Cebula, she is shot and killed in a Turkish Metro station, by a gunman who is clearly watching for where Kepler will go next. Who is trying to kill Kepler, and why? This is a fast-paced thriller that spans over two centuries, and at least three continents. The plot is highly original, taking several turns before reaching a spectacular climax at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. North gives the reader characters who will charm or, in some cases repulse. Their flaws and foibles are realistic and may well have the reader wondering about their own reaction to this sort of immortality. Their dialogue is natural, and the banter between Coyle and Kepler is often snappy and amusing. North gives a whole new meaning to the concept of \u201cestate agent\u201d, and her description of the chase through the museum conjures the image of a Mexican wave. This latest offering by Claire North is clever and often funny, and readers who enjoyed The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August will not be disappointed.

Like The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August, it takes a classic idea \u2014 in that case a kind of immortality, in this a body-hopping entity \u2014 and explores it almost to destruction. It doesn\u2019t always work 100% for me, here, but it works better for me than Harry August, and the pace is a lot more thrilling. There is something about the narrator that seemed similar, though; I kinda hope I don\u2019t find that same tone when I go back to Mirror Dreams, Claire North\u2019s first book back when she was Catherine Webb. I remember loving the tone of those books, the personality of the narrator; it\u2019d be a little sad to me if that\u2019s more about the author\u2019s style than about the specific character.Nonetheless, this is fun, and the bit that works the best is the love Kepler has for the bodies he inhabits. The way you come to understand his absolutely genuine love, which at first seems impossible, then perhaps monstrous. It makes you care about him because, okay, going for the pun here \u2014 he gets into your skin. And it\u2019d be a little intoxicating to be loved by Kepler, to have him make the best of you and give you a wonderful life because he loves you.

The First Fifteen Lives of Harry August was a spellbinding, original and inventive read and Touch is another novel of a similar ilk, focusing around a different protagonist but nonetheless incredibly entertaining, sending us into the guise of Kepler, a man who can possess bodies at whim, seeing lives through the eyes of their hosts for minutes or lifetimes, it doesn\u2019t matter. It starts with his death, and explodes from there.The prose is incredibly well written and at the same time, Touch moves along super fast, balancing the character development with story and action very well. The premise is instantly appealing, with the ability to jump between characters at will, including between both females and males. When Kepler is possessing a woman named Josephine Cubla who gets killed in a Turkish Metro station by someone who knows what Kepler can do, the book turns into a hunt for answers that takes place across a vast span of locations. As the curtain is peeled back we start to learn more about Kepler and the fact that he\u2019s being hunted by someone or something who knows what he can do, adding an element of intrigue which really works.The interesting development of the characters comes when you look at the Ghosts themselves. Most don\u2019t really care what happens to their hosts, and why should they? They can just move onto the next one at a whim, but Keplar is different and protects his inhabitants well throughout the centuries. It\u2019s an interesting motivation for the character and provides for the spark of mystery and intrigue to kick off. Yes, there is a lot of body swapping which could present some confusion, but if you pay attention you shouldn\u2019t get too lost. The blend between flashbacks and present narrative could have easily been a jumbled mess and whilst it may be overly complex to some, I very much enjoyed Touch. It\u2019s original, smart and richly compelling with a powerful prose.The concept is the main drawing point of the novel but the characters are equally fascinating and the premise holds up well. As a standalone science fiction novel, Touch doesn\u2019t disappoint, making it two out of two for Claire North books that I\u2019ve read and enjoyed.

Nowadays they tend to be far more considerate of their bodies, entering mutual agreements and making friends or 'gofers' to aid them move smoothly through life. Kepler is not quite the dispassionate 'estate agent' of people as they are in the flashbacks we read. Just as Kepler has to contend with each body's identity, they are forced to confront the way they themselves have changed in personality and behaviour. This is what leads us to the series of events in this book.Kepler is such an interesting protagonist to read about. Unconstrained by gender, race, age or body, Kepler prefers to assume the identity (or imagined identity) of the body they are inhabiting. At the same time, they stand apart, knowing that they have a life outside of this temporary one. Wondering if they have a job they should be at, a family they should be returning to. This is probably why, as others confirm, Kepler prefers to reside in bodies of prostitutes or thieves, leaving them at the end of their term with a better, often wealthier life.It's a fascinating read, one that far exceeds the clumsy praise of my review. I highly recommend it to anyone interesting in a good thriller, and/or is willing to consider what it means to be 'me'.Then like Kepler and Galileo ask yourself; \"do you like what you see?\"Disclaimer: I received a free copy of this little gem from netgalley and The Little Brown Book Group.

He had been attacked in a public street by a robber and killed - at least, his body was killed. He had reached out as he bled out - and boom! He was inside the robber; correction, he WAS the robber! Then he was the policeman who came, then he was the passerby, then he was the prostitute, then he was the shopkeeper, then he was the tourist...And so on, virtually immortal and able to take over the body of anyone it touches.Over time, it develops rules to limit the damage it causes. When it lives inside a possessed body, that person does not remember what the entity does whether the possession is only of one second in duration or for twenty years or until death. It lives with the body's wife or husband or parents or friends, in the person's job or life or it simply walks the body away to disappear for a few days or forever. Sexual identity is of no consequence or importance - only access and lifestyle matters. Unfortunately, the entity does not know what the original person knows, and neither does it pass on what it intellectually learns or any memories of what it does to the original person's life while in possession. When the entity was young, terrible things sometimes happened to the host which often were the fault of the entity. But now the entity, who calls itself Kepler, makes an effort to improve the lives of those it takes over. Kepler even falls in love with the people it uses as a vehicle. It especially likes using prostitutes and blue-collar workers. One day, Kepler finds out by accident there are more of its kind. They cannot occupy the same body without destroying the body. When two of them try to occupy a body, the person begins to have blood vessel ruptures everywhere. Yikes! But soon Kepler learns about the other different entities - all with differing personalities, preferences, likes and dislikes. Some never care much about the damage they cause to their 'vehicles', others, like Kepler, like and love some of their possessed humans. Kepler develops a moral code because the only way he can live is by possessing people and taking over their bodies, for which he feels grateful. If the body dies with Kepler in it, it will die with the body. So Kepler and the other entities leap and leap and leap from person to person through the centuries, traveling over the world.The entities are like immortal gods - immature, irresponsible and pleasure seeking. They do not really spend a lot of time together. However, Kepler makes an enemy of one of the other entities. The other entity, which has taken the name of Galileo, wants to kill Kepler, so Kepler avoids Galileo and it hopefully solves the issue. Kepler has moved on and into a woman he loves, but then its lovely life is suddenly disrupted. The woman is shot! Kepler goes on a run through many bodies. He learns other entities have been attacked and many have died a true death with their vehicle. How are they being tracked? Kepler discovers there now exists an international organization whose sole purpose is to kill the entities. Omg! Kepler is in a war not of its choosing. Whatever. Kepler is going to fight back.Some readers who wrote reviews I noticed became bored by the parade of possessed people - literally hundreds of characters whose details are briefly described in a few sentences, information which is mined from wallets and purses, as our 'hero' Kepler tries to take care of them as he passes through, disrupting what they were in the middle of doing -allergies? aches and pains? hungry? children waiting? The huge cast of characters amused me as much as if I were having lunch in a Starbucks and was people-watching through the window! There also are questions about whether Kepler is a good or bad person. It is clear it is a living being intent on surviving as well as enjoying its life. It is a parasite, imho, nothing more, nothing less. It has the choice of acting good or bad as do we all, but it obviously feels its first duty is to its own survival. Of course, an entity like Kepler which has become insane would be a real monster!This is such a fun book! The plot is exciting and interesting, with thought-provoking themes and ideas."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul", "userReview": "The first time that Kepler discovered that he could jump from one body to another was when he was first murdered.

There he lives their lives, experiences their feelings, sometimes for a few moments, sometimes for a whole lifetime.

On top of that, there is a reasonably plotted thriller with fast pacing and good twists. I particularly liked the way that she used the concept of amnesia to explain how the hosts couldn\u2019t always explain what had happened when the presence departed. It can get a little confusing as they flit between each body so very quickly and I didn\u2019t really get why there were parts of the story that took us back in time to past experiences, it was enough to keep up with the regular characters.

Claire North writes with a wonderfully touching style that is almost matter of fact but gets across a real sense of feeling and emotion.On top of that there is a great \u201cthriller\u201d aspect to this story \u2013 as Kepler comes under threat there are some heart stopping moments \u2013 Add to the mix other great characters, some like Kepler, some solidly and often scarily human and you have one heck of a good yarn. I will not say more \u2013 this is a book to dive into head first and enjoy every second of.I like a novel that pushes the boundaries \u2013 Claire North does that here in a captivating way, with a cutting edge writing style and a truly remarkable protagonist and as such this gets a Highly Recommended from me.Never have I been so pleased that I missed out on a debut \u2013 this is Claire\u2019s second novel, her first, \u201cThe First Fifteen Lives of Harry August\u201d somehow managed to pass me by but I have it on my shelf now and I\u2019m dying to get to it \u2013 if it is anything close to as good as \u201cTouch\u201d I am in for a treat.Happy Reading Folks!"}], "description": "Kepler had never meant to die this way \u2014 viciously beaten to death by a stinking vagrant in a dark back alley. But when reaching out to the murderer for salvation in those last dying moments, a sudden switch takes place.Now Kepler is looking out through the eyes of the killer himself, staring down at a broken and ruined body lying in the dirt of the alley.Instead of dying, Kepler has gained the ability to roam from one body to another, to jump into another person\u2019s skin and see through their eyes, live their life \u2014 be it for a few minutes, a few months or a lifetime.Kepler means these host bodies no harm \u2014 and even comes to cherish them intimately like lovers. But when one host, Josephine Cebula, is brutally assassinated, Kepler embarks on a mission to seek the truth \u2014 and avenge Josephine\u2019s death.", "title": "Touch", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22314178-touch", "average": 3.8, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1415977617l/22314178.jpg", "reviews": 1017, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7210024.Claire_North", "name": "Claire North"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Thriller", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22314178-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26173919-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24383348-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28472279-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23561557-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25038154-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23401156-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20706317-the-first-fifteen-lives-of-harry-august", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25746699-the-sudden-appearance-of-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31408829-the-end-of-the-day", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25210813-the-serpent", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25210814-the-thief", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9409759-powers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38213061-leviathan-wakes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
