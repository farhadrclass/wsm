Just wow! I was pulled into this book right from the beginning. I couldn't put it down all day. This book put me on an emotional ride. A book about strength, and never giving up. A father who openly shows the love he has for his daughter on the journey to find her, where other fathers wouldn't even give it a second thought of when it came to their daughters; it would be one less mouth to feed. It's sad to think that child trafficking happens everyday in this world, and I hope one day it will stop."}, {"userName": "Becky \u2661The Bookworm\u2661", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29318167-becky-the-bookworm", "userReview": "It took several chapters for me to really get into this story. I found the writing to be very simple. It could easily be understood by a very young reader, but the subject matter is more mature in nature. The author appeared to have done a lot of research. I'm not a world traveler, so I can't speak to the accuracy of the Chinese culture reflected in the story, although most of it was fascinating. Other cultural differences left me feeling equal parts outraged and horrified. I found it sad that girls born into more traditional Chinese families could potentially face the futures mentioned in this book. Chai is one of the lucky daughters. Her father, Jun, adores her, feels blessed to have a healthy and intelligent daughter, and strives to open her horizons with books and education. He is not rich and works extremely hard to provide what little he can. I loved the bond between this father and daughter and the way Chai relied on past conversations to keep hope alive after she was kidnapped with her best friend Josi.\n\u201cOur families will find us, Josi. Baba always told me that people are connected to those who are supposed to be in their lives by an invisible red thread. We might be a little off track right now, but I promise we\u2019ll find our way back to where we are meant to be.\u201d\nThe way the girls stuck together and held each other up was very special. They were deeply connected by their friendship and the tragic circumstances only cemented that bond. In short, they became inseparable and were stronger in the face of their challenges because of it.Overall, I enjoyed reading the book. At times it brought tears to my eyes, or angered me deeply at the injustice of what was happening. The author does have an important message to impart to her audience. I understand this particular story is fiction, but I've watched other news reports on television about stolen brides. I've read articles about missing girls in poverty stricken China (or other parts of the world) who never find their way back home. It is a real issue. This book isn't the most elegantly written story I've picked up, but the story touched my heart. If by reading it and putting up a review I can help shine a spotlight on the problem, then I'm getting a lot more out of my time than the enjoyment of reading a decent book.I give it my recommendation with a trigger warning for attempted rape and violence."}, {"userName": "shannon  Stubbs", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38311546-shannon-stubbs", "userReview": "Really enjoyed itI really enjoyed this story. I read it with my 8 year old daughter. It opened up a conversation about going e with strangers, no matter how they look and act, could be dangerous. The story was about these two girls who were kidnapped to be child brides for families in a fishing village. The emotional journey of the two girls, and one of the fathers, had me wanting to wAnt to know what happens next. There were many parts in the story where I was in tears over sadness and happiness. It was a really good book. It was so good, I had to check to make sure it wasn't a true story. The author did a good job discussing human trafficking that goes on right now."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "Had an interesting premises. Two modern-day Chinese girls are kidnapped and sold to a fishing family who wants one of them for a bride for their son and the other is used as a servant. The father of one of the girls carries on a search for them. Unfortunately, the pace of the book was slow and I just couldn't get into the characters at all. I felt no commitment to them or anxiousness over their situation. I was surprised to find that this is one of many books by Ms. Bratt. I thought it might be a first effort and as such showed some promise of development. Others might be able to connect to this story and the failure might be more in the reader than the writer in this instance."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/894835-heather", "userReview": "A well written book that explores the terrible realities of being poor in China.

My only complaint is that it was almost too happy. Everything works out perfectly in the end and no one is hurt. This just seems unreasonable for a book about child kidnapping, and children being sold to families for labor & wives. Otherwise it was really uplifting and great to have an older man who didn't believe in the gender norms of China."}, {"userName": "Kathi Olsen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1864661-kathi-olsen", "userReview": "Although this is fiction it is based on a problem in many countries. Stealing children for slave or sex (not in this book) trade. Stealing two girls for the intent of grooming one for a bride for the oldest son. The main character was fortunate enough that her father was progressive in teaching her that a female has worth even in China. The author ends the book with her experiences dealing with this subject. A worthwhile read and an opportunity to admire the characters."}, {"userName": "Nance Roepke", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62982201-nance-roepke", "userReview": "Wanted to like it but didn'tThe concept of two teenage friends being taken from their families and hoping to find their way back home could have and should have been suspenseful and exciting but wasn't.

If that is so, the fates of Chai and Josi are weaved together and tied with a knot that cannot be broken.Chai has been the self-appointed protector of her best friend, Josi, since their toddler days. Their lives are as far from extravagant as can be imagined \u2014 but they don\u2019t need material things to be content. Their carefree childhood comes to a screeching halt when they are snatched together and sold as house help, and possible future brides, to a family far away.This novel chronicles the girls\u2019 struggle to adjust to their harsh new realities once the comforts and security of their old lives are stripped away. While Josi and others around them in the same situation have reluctantly accepted their new roles, Chai\u2019s warrior spirit cannot be broken. She remains strong and refuses to give up hope of finding a way home.Due to the infamous gender imbalance in China, thousands of females are trafficked every year to be sold as brides in remote villages and cities. Because of the lack of family resources, and the minimal efforts of the government to break up these criminal rings, many of the girls are never heard from again.
