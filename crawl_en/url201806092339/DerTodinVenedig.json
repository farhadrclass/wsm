In many ways, a work of considerable genius.Unfortunately, the story itself felt ho hum and left me cold and rather unenthused. Given this considerable dichotomy, between the me that was significantly impressed by Mann's obvious talent, and the more emotional, \"enjoyment-centric\" me left wanting more by a narrative that seemed dry and lifeless, I\u2019ve resolved to revisit this work in a few years (it's only 150 pages) for a follow up. Hopefully, at that point, one of me will hold sway. For now...both of me will straddle the fence of wishy-washy indecision. However, regardless of whether my future interactions with the story add to or subtract from my first impression, there\u2019s no denying that there is much to admire, even be amazed by, in this slim, tightly compacted work loaded with full-bodied ideas. I just wished for a deeper connection to the characters and the tale. PLOT SUMMARY:It\u2019s the early 20th century, and in a decaying Europe that is drifting towards war, an austere, deeply repressed author suffers from a severe bout of writer's block. To clear his mind and get his creative juices flowing again, Gustav von Aschenbach takes a holiday and winds up amidst the beautiful decadence of Venice.\n This was Venice, the flattering and suspect beauty--this city, half fairy tale and half tourist trap, in whose insalubrious air the arts once rankly and voluptuously blossomed, where composers have been inspired to lulling tones of somniferous eroticism.\n While there, von Aschensbach becomes infatuated with the striking, classical beauty of a teenage boy named Tadzio. Slowly, the writer begins to lose control of his emotional austerity as his long-bottled passions avalanche over him. Despite never acting on his impulse of having any contact with the youth whatsoever, von Aschenbach's infatuation descends into a destructive obsession that leaves him unhinged and adrift from his rationality.Meanwhile, a deadly cholera epidemic is stealthily spreading through the city, and von Aschenbach, though he can feel the onset of symptoms, is too enthralled to make his escape. Eventually...a death occurs...in Venice. THOUGHTS:Despite being written by a German author about a Prussian author, and set in 20th century Italy, this story has Greek tragedy written all over it. Mann's story is steeped in allusions to mythology, and is strongly influenced by Plato's The Symposium and ]Phaedrus, carrying forward their central arguments regarding the man\u2019s struggle between passion and wisdom.Having not read either of these works, I'm sure there are some references that strolled right past me without me having a clue they were even in the room. Nevertheless, I don't think a familiarity with these texts is essential to enjoying this story, though it could certainly enhance it.In keeping with the Greek sympathies central to Mann\u2019s novella, the relationship between von Aschenbach and Tadzio (the boy) is clearly a reference to the platonic ideal of erotic love described by Plato and Socrates. Additionally, Mann includes a whole host of mythological allusions to highlight our protagonist's psychological and physical demise, beginning with von Aschenbach\u2019s gondola ride into Venice that mirrors the journey of many a Greek hero into Hades. At its heart, this is a cautionary tale regarding the danger of extremes, and the need to maintain a sense of balance in the conduct of one's life. Mann shows us someone who has lived a carefully controlled, passion free life in the pursuit of moral, intellectual art. When we first encounter von Aschenbach, he is an emotional corpse existing in the extreme state of pure reason and utter sensual denial. Mann shows us this not as an ideal, but as one end of the spectrum to be avoided. Now, when confronted with the exotic, sensation-filled atmosphere of Venice, von Aschenbach\u2019s suppressed desires bubble to the surface, and his carefully constructed, intellect-driven world crumbles in the face of the onslaught. <>\"His head and his heart were drunk, and his steps followed the dictates of that dark god whose pleasure it is to trample man's reason and dignity underfoot.\" Swiftly, our protagonist finds himself at the other extreme, a slave to his passions, the object of which is encapsulated in the character of Tadzio. Excessively rigid morality exchanged for unrestrained passion\u2026reason abandoned and moderation impossible, von Aschenbach's world deteriorates under the weight of his unchecked desires. It is his falling from one extreme to another, and his inability to achieve a balance, that leads eventually to his self-destruction. My biggest problem with the above is that understood it without feeling it. I would spot an allusion that Mann was incorporating and think how impressive it was\u2026but it never translated into an emotional connection to the story. Thus, I was kept at a distance from the story, and this left me feeling less enamored with the work as a whole, than its prodigious technical achievements might otherwise merit. Still, as I mention above, there is much to love about this work, and part of my tepid reaction to the story may be my unfamiliarity with some of the source texts that Mann draws upon for inspiration. I intend to visit Plato\u2019s The Symposium and/or Phaedrus, and check back in with this work further down the road. For now, an impressed 3.5 stars.

But there is reason this is still so widely read today (curious how, unlike LOLITA, the subject of this book isn't as important as the theme when it comes to criticism): the writing. Mann's marvelous turns of phrase carry the day and his ruminations on the nature of creativity stand in wonderful counterpoint to Marcel's more spiritual realization near the end of LOST TIME. Consider:\"Nothing gladdens a writer more than a thought that can be come pure feeling and a feeling that can become pure thought.\"and\u201cSolitude favors the original, the daringly and otherworldly beautiful, the poem. But it also favors the wrongful, the extreme, the absurd, and the forbidden.\"and\"Like any lover, he desired to please; suffered at the thought of failure.\u201d These lines spill out as the aged writer Aschenbach begins getting more extreme in his behavior, stalking young Tadzio, the boy he loves, through the diseased streets of Venice. Here, Mann achieves something extraordinary: he unlocks the close correspondence between creativity and obsession, between the propriety of making art and the tremendous improprieties that can be side-effect of leaving yourself open to the making of art. Tight in on Aschenbach as we are, morality barely enters into the novella. Instead, in an autobiographical turn by Mann, we see the that repression and beauty often work in counterpoint.As the book accelerates toward its (extremely foreshadowed) ending, we get an especially good scene, as Aschenbach, who derides men who attempt to be younger than they are at the beginning of the book, dyes his hair and gets slathered in make-up in an attempt to please Tadzio. It's a gorgeous moment of pathos, the clown at midnight (soon after a night sequence with a clown), and it will stick with me.DIV is humorless, but you know that going in with Mann. This translation seemed good to me - I have the earlier one as well and when I compared them it wasn't particularly close. Nowhere near the heights of MAGIC MOUNTAIN, which is one of my favorites, but worth your time."}, {"userName": "Seemita", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34622220-seemita", "userReview": "As long as we breathe, we live. We do not possess the power to embrace death at will. So, we live. And for living, we cling to a purpose. The purpose may be clear or clouded, animate or inanimate, expressed or hidden, stable or fickle but we have it nonetheless. Even the person accused of leading a purposeless life is surviving on the shredded purpose of vagrancy.So it doesn\u2019t come as a surprise that even Gustav Aschenbach, notwithstanding the fame and dignity safely held in his bag of accolades, gropes for purpose in his new found state of ripe mind. Nothing is a bigger curse for a writer than to have hit a plateau from where all the previous works appear a distant dream and the present air leaves nothing for the fertile imagination to latch on. In search of this elusive purpose, after declaring many destinations unfit for ideation, he halts at Venice at a quaint hotel and opens the window of his room to the sea, inviting both its calmness and ferocity to wash his rusted mind panes with inspiring waves.And the sea obliges, in the form of the ethereal Tadzio, who happens to be a guest of the same hotel as Gustav. The stunning beauty of this young Polish boy of golden skin, flowing locks, delicately-crafted ribs and carefree demeanour, first catches Gustav unawares and then, slowly like a persisting rain, fogs his mind panes with sensual dew. His senses, in a natural gesture, follow Tadzio\u2019s movements like a sunflower follows the sun\u2019s trail. From the day he sets his eyes on Tadzio, he gets transported to a new world where he increasingly finds just the two of them, talking about art and beauty, exchanging life wisdoms and sinking in the loving companionship of each other. But does this throbbing one-sided passion render a purpose to the debilitating parchment of his life or relegate it further to insurmountable lows? Hold the hand of Mann to find out. And yes, he has a lot to say in this compact work.He softly pits intellectual beauty against corporeal beauty and questions whether attaining the fulsome body of the former, can, in any way, deride the necessity of the latter\u2019s blossoming. He also nudges us to consider the propriety of actions taken under the influence of relationships which, in the safety net of sanguinity, can deluge the delicate fabric of morality. He also presses us to weigh the artistic liberties in the light of societal approvals and take a stand.For the striking questions and delicately coherent wordplay, I was about to give this work a rating of four. But Mann snatched the solitary star from my hand by playing this masterstroke: A dream where Gustav has donned the garb of Socrates and Tadzio, of Phaedo and the former is giving his life lessons to the young warrior of tomorrow.\n\u2019Because beauty, Phaedo, is the only thing that is divine and visible at the same time, and so it is the way of the artist to the soul. But do you believe, my dear Phaedo, that the one who reaches the intellectual through the senses can ever achieve wisdom and human dignity? Or do you believe (and I am leaving this to you) that it is a lovely but dangerous road that leads nowhere? Because you have to realize that we artists cannot take the path of beauty without Eros joining us and becoming our leader; we may be heroes in our own way, but we are still like women, because passion is what elevates us, and our desire is love\u2014that is our lust and our disgrace. Do you see that poets can be neither sage nor dignified? We do not like final knowledge, because knowledge, Phaedo, has no dignity or severity: it knows, understands, forgives, without attitude; it is sympathetic to the abyss, it is the abyss.\u2019\nAn artist is able when he can turn thought to emotion and emotion to thought with equal finesse. But he is legendary when he can turn a non-artist, artist. And I know Gustav, in the end, did both jobs well."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\u201cSolitude produces originality, bold & astonishing beauty, poetry. But solitude also produces perverseness, the disproportionate, the absurd, and the forbidden.\u201d \u2015 Thomas Mann, Death in VenicePortrait of the artist as an old man.I've been intimidated by Mann. He's a mountain. I own a bunch of his works, in various translations, but keep finding reasons to walk another road, skip ahead, fall behind. For me he has sat waiting like a distant leviathan or like death. So, finding myself in a position where I really felt I could delay no longer, I started with his shorter work - Death in Venice. First, the introduction by Michael Cunningham is a fantastic introduction of the difficulties associated with translation. All fiction is a translation. All works differ, since they all are impacted by writer and reader. Both imperfect, both carrying their own history. Even the same work, read by the same reader at different times (think King Lear) will be interpreted anew, feel different to the reader at different stages and ages. So, it is with translations. Different translators are going to experience Mann's Death in Venice in different ways. Gustav von Aschenbach will appear the fool to some or an artist gripped by obscession and passion by others. There is no exactly right answer.This book was probably a 4-star book for me, but I added the star because I really did like the Cunningham intro (so extra-credit, why not?). So, how was this translation? I don't know. I don't read German and have only read ONE translation, but I loved Heim's take. I love the idea of Aschenbach's obscession overtaking him and ultimately (perhaps?) destroying him. We all would be so lucky if our passions destroyed us, perhaps. So, perhaps, I am ready for Buddenbrooks: The Decline of a Family."}, {"userName": "Traveller", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3145526-traveller", "userReview": "[ Achenbach deliberately does not tell Tadzio's mother about the epidemic in order to avoid the outcome that Tadzio's family would leave the resort; which would remove Tadzio from the older man's proximity.

The work presents a great writer suffering writer's block who visits Venice and is liberated, uplifted, and then increasingly obsessed, by the sight of a stunningly beautiful youth. Though he never speaks to the boy, much less touches him, the writer finds himself drawn deep into ruinous inward passion; meanwhile, Venice, and finally, the writer himself, succumb to a cholera plague.The boy in the story (Tadzio) is based on a boy (W\u0142adzio or Tadzio, nicknames for the Polish name W\u0142adys\u0142aw or Tadeusz respectively) Mann had seen during a visit to Venice in 1911.The main character is Gustav von Aschenbach, a famous author in his early fifties who has recently been ennobled in honor of his artistic achievement (thus acquiring the aristocratic \"von\" in his name). He is a man dedicated to his art, disciplined and ascetic to the point of severity, who was widowed at a young age. As the story opens, he is strolling outside a cemetery and sees a coarse-looking red-haired foreigner who stares back at him belligerently. Aschenbach walks away, embarrassed but curiously stimulated. He has a vision of a primordial swamp-wilderness, fertile, exotic and full of lurking danger. Soon afterwards, he resolves to take a holiday. ...\u0645\u0631\u06af \u062f\u0631 \u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0632 - \u062a\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0627\u0646 (\u0646\u06af\u0627\u0647) \u0627\u062f\u0628\u06cc\u0627\u062a\u061b \u062a\u0627\u0631\u06cc\u062e \u0646\u062e\u0633\u062a\u06cc\u0646 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0634: \u0645\u0627\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0631 \u0633\u0627\u0644 2002 \u0645\u06cc\u0644\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0645\u0631\u06af \u062f\u0631 \u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0632\u061b \u062a\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0646\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0648\u062d\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0646\u06af\u0627\u0647\u060c 1379\u060c \u062f\u0631 159 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9646736238\u061b \u0639\u0646\u0648\u0627\u0646: \u0645\u0631\u06af \u062f\u0631 \u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0632\u061b \u062a\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0627\u0646\u061b \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645: \u0645\u062d\u0645\u0648\u062f \u062d\u062f\u0627\u062f\u06cc\u061b \u062a\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0646\u060c \u0627\u0641\u0642\u060c 1393\u060c \u062f\u0631 141 \u0635\u061b \u0634\u0627\u0628\u06a9: 9789643699468\u061b \u0645\u0648\u0636\u0648\u0639: \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0627\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0622\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0642\u0631\u0646 20 \u0645\u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u0635\u0644\u06cc \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0627\u06cc \u0633\u062a \u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a\u0646 \u0646\u062f\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0628\u0647 \u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u0645\u06cc\u0631\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u062f\u0631 \u0622\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0639\u0627\u0634\u0642 \u067e\u0633\u0631 \u062c\u0648\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u0627 \u0622\u0646\u06a9\u0647 \u0647\u0631\u06af\u0632\u06cc \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062f\u0648 \u0628\u0627\u0647\u0645 \u06af\u0641\u062a\u06af\u0648\u06cc\u06cc \u0646\u0645\u06cc\u200c\u06a9\u0646\u0646\u062f \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0639\u0634\u0642 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u062d\u0627\u0644 \u062f\u06cc\u06af\u0631\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0647\u0627\u06cc\u06cc \u0648 \u0627\u0639\u062a\u0644\u0627\u06cc \u0631\u0648\u062d\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0631\u0633\u0627\u0646\u062f. \u0628\u0627 \u0647\u0645\u0647\u200c \u06af\u06cc\u0631\u06cc \u0648\u0628\u0627 \u062f\u0631 \u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0646\u06cc\u0632 \u0628\u06cc\u0645\u0627\u0631 \u0645\u06cc\u200c\u0634\u0648\u062f\u0646\u0642\u0644 \u0627\u0632 \u0645\u0642\u062f\u0645\u0647 \u0645\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645 \u062d\u0633\u0646 \u0646\u06a9\u0648\u0631\u0648\u062d: \u0645\u0631\u06af \u0622\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0627\u062e \u062f\u0631 \u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0632\u060c \u0622\u0646\u06af\u0648\u0646\u0647 \u06a9\u0647 \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u0627\u062b\u0631 \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0645\u0627\u06cc\u0634 \u06af\u0630\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0645\u06cc\u0634\u0648\u062f\u060c \u0627\u0632 \u0639\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641 \u0648 \u0645\u062a\u0646\u0648\u0639\u06cc \u062a\u0631\u06a9\u06cc\u0628 \u0634\u062f\u0647\u060c \u06a9\u0647 \u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u062f\u0631\u06a9 \u0635\u062d\u06cc\u062d \u0622\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645\u0647 \u06cc \u0639\u0646\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0631\u0627 \u0628\u0647 \u062f\u0631\u0633\u062a\u06cc \u0634\u0646\u0627\u062e\u062a\u060c \u062f\u0631 \u0627\u06cc\u0646\u062c\u0627 \u0627\u0632 \u0631\u0626\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u0645 \u0648 \u0646\u0627\u062a\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u0645 \u06af\u0631\u0641\u062a\u0647 \u062a\u0627 \u0627\u0645\u067e\u0631\u0633\u06cc\u0648\u0646\u06cc\u0633\u0645 \u0648 \u0633\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0644\u06cc\u0633\u0645 \u0648 ... \u0647\u0645\u0647 -

That howl - more distress than joy. Mania, frenzy, delirium; a Dionysian letting go. This is the mental picture that furnished my mind as I read of Gustav von Aschenbach. Aschenbach is the eminent artist of disciplined control, he has based his whole career on fame, he has achieved recognition through hard graft, a hundred little inspirations that have accrued, that have been beaten out and formed into a burnished oeuvre of classicist grace and clarity. But the machine begins to whir out of control, that motus animi continuus, the very heart of eloquence, continues to spin its wheels, refuses to be regulated by the measured rhythm of Aschenbach's daily routine afternoon snooze, spins, spins, whirs on, he must out to quiet the beast.Very swiftly the stage seems to darken into a dream-like state. The tram stop deserted, the streets bare, a stranger suddenly, inexplicably, at the portico of the mortuary chapel - and Aschenbach experiences an opening of his soul, a sudden unrest. Wanderlust, he calls it. Really? This nightmare vision of a primordial wilderness of the dank and decaying, this jungle of greenery with the glowering eyes of a tiger? A vision so stark that he has to shake his head to rid himself of it? But Aschenbach has always been aware of the need for travel as a hygienic necessity, the needed (earned?) escape from work, that \"rigorous, frigid, and ardent duty.\"Aschenbach lives his life with a tightly clenched fist - but on his journey to Trieste, then Pula, then Venice, he gradually begins to relax that grip, the fist opens, the arm hangs loose. He is carried on the water, he is rowed by a menacing gondolier who takes him further than he wants to go, warning him that he will pay, he will pay. And pay he will. But he is delivered safely to the very edge of the civilised world, and there, at the next table in his hotel, waiting for dinner, is a family of young Poles, amongst them a boy of around fourteen. \"With astonishment Aschenbach noticed that the boy was perfectly beautiful.\" Vollkommen sch\u00f6n.Beauty. Kant calls it \"interesseloses Wohlgefallen\" - disinterested pleasure, an echo of Plato's ideas. According to Plato there is a realm of ultimate ideals, where goodness, wisdom, truth exist in changeless perfection. A vision of these ideals is planted into our souls, but man is a forgetful creature, and loses the sharp focus of that vision. Reason, Justice, Virtue cannot be perceived by our senses, but there is one perfect ideal which is visible, and that is Beauty. An earthly image of Beauty reminds us with a frisson of shock of that Absolute. Thus physical beauty here on earth points to a higher reality, a purely spiritual abstract concept. Ah but. There has to be a but. Beauty is a sensuous pleasure, and can provoke a purely sensual response. To have, to hold, to possess, to enjoy. That is not the entrance to a higher sphere. Disinterested pleasure, remember.Aschenbach has to be given the opportunity to enjoy this perfection as a high ideal: surely that is why Tadzio is a prepubescent male, the incarnation of the unspoilt perfect body, no unsightly sproutings or eruptions, smooth, slender, harmonious. It ought to be, has to be possible to leave carnal desire out of the account, to admire this creature as divine ideal. And indeed Aschenbach starts quite well, with transcendental thoughts over dinner about the relationship between the general and the particular in human beauty \"from there to think about the general problems of form and art and eventually found his thoughts and findings to resemble certain apparently fortuitous ideas in a dream, that on closer inspection reveal themselves to be completely stale and unworkable.\" And the next morning there is a putrid smell in the lagoon.Ah but Aschenbach battles. He tries to see the Greek statue, the perfection, himself as a fatherly figure: \"And a fatherly awe, the complete devotion of the one who tries to create beauty to the one who is endowed with it filled and moved his heart.\" He strains to remain the disinterested artist, sees the analogy between his work and this example of youthful perfection, his hewing from the marble of language and this perfect form, are they not similar? \"His eyes embraced that noble figure at the bounds of the blue, and in enthusiastic rapture he believed to embrace beauty itself, form as a thought in the mind of God, the one and pure perfection living in the human spirit and of which a human image and analog was erected here for worship.\" But this is intoxication, 'Rausch', the frenzy of self-deceit. He believes his own poetic musings - but wanton desire is the worm in the rose. Tadzio is no ideal, he is all too human, and it is no longer beauty as such that Aschenbach worships from afar. He wants, he desires human contact. A look, a smile. Recognition.Well, we know how it ends. Aschenbach, no longer named, but given epithets; the one who is led astray, the confused, the intoxicated, the infatuated, is no longer able to resist, either his own infatuation or the cholera that is infiltrating the whole system. 'Eine sittliche Fabel' Mann calls this, a moral tale. Those artists who give up the dignity of a social position and go in pursuit of beauty will come to disaster. Aha.But it's never that easy, not with Thomas Mann. He delights in undercutting himself, building ambiguities into the work, puzzles for the reader to mull over. What kind of artist is Aschenbach? Are we to admire his mastery and classicizing style? Most of the novel is in free indirect speech, so are we to assume that the narrative voice is Aschenbach's? Those false little classicizing flag-ups at the beginning, a spring afternoon in the year 19.., like Goethe or Kleist, or that over-precious sunrise that Aschenbach sees from his hotel window: after a wing\u00e9d word brings a message from Olympia, we are treated to plenty of references to Eos, Cleitos and Cephalos and Orion and then we get this rather recherch\u00e9 description: \"At the world's edge began a strewing of roses, a shining and a blooming ineffably pure; baby cloudlets hung illuminated, like attendant amoretti, in the blue and blushful haze; purple effulgence fell upon the sea, that seemed to heave it forward on its welling waves; from horizon to zenith went quivering thrusts like golden lances...\" Well, you get the picture - that's the DH Lawrence translation, he really gets that rococo style parody that sloshes into the sentimental. So Aschenbach's claim to be an artist might be seen as doubtful. And we've seen that he equates what he does with Tadzio's beauty, we are constantly told that Tadzio is beautiful, but again, what kind of beauty is this? His teeth are rotten, he's weak and cosseted, the family pet, not at all the athletic Greek God ideal. Effete. Over-pretty, like Aschenbach's sunrise. So is this the story of an artist in pursuit of true beauty, or is it the story of an artist whose artistry is never convincingly portrayed, in pursuit of a beauty that mirrors his own corruption, complaisance and self-mockery?A play of illusions."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237469-miriam", "userReview": "How did I not know that Mann lived in California for a decade? http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ger..."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4542979-kim", "userReview": "I find this a difficult work to review. On the one hand, I\u2019m awed by the complexity of the narrative, its haunting imagery, the richness of the symbolism and the layers of meaning which Mann was able to give such a short work. On the other hand, a plot involving an older man becoming obsessed with and stalking a beautiful young boy is designed to make 21st century readers feel uncomfortable. Or at least, it\u2019s designed to make me feel uncomfortable. I have difficulty seeing the Ancient Greek practice of paiderastia - the socially acknowledged erotic relationship between an adult man and a teenage boy - which is part of the inspiration for the work, in positive terms. I also have difficulty with the idea that a young male is \u2013 or should be - the personification of ideal beauty. However, Mann didn\u2019t write this novella to make readers comfortable. There is painful self-reflection, passion and truth in his writing. The themes he explores - artistic choices, the meaning of beauty, the struggle to accept the inevitability of decay and death - are confronting, challenging and ultimately deeply moving. As I listened to the audiobook I regretted once again my lack of a classical education. I know little about Greek mythology, allusions to which are an important part of the narrative. Not being familiar with the stories to which Mann refers didn\u2019t lessen the intensity of the experience. Familiarity with them would have added an extra dimension to it. Images from this work will haunt me forever. And I\u2019ll never think of Venice in quite the same way again."}, {"userName": "Kyriakos Sorokkou", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL":

precis for this canonical work. Gustav von Ascherbach, literary lion in his sixties, wanders about his home town of Munich while struggling with a recalcitrant new story. His chance encounter with a weirdo, though no words are exchanged between them, ignites in Herr von Ascherbach the need to get out of town, to get himself to the delicious fleshpots of the South. An abortive stay in Illyria (now Bosnia or Montenegro or Croatia, no knowing which since we're not given much to go on) leads him to make his second journey to Venice. Arriving in the sin capital of the early modern world, and even in the early 20th century possessed of a louche reputation, brings him into contact with two life-changing things: A beautiful teenaged boy, and cholera. I think the title fills you in on the rest.My Review: I know this was written in 1911-1912, and is therefore to be judged by the standards of another era, but I am bone-weary of stories featuring men whose love for other males brings them to disaster and death. This is the story that started me on that path of dislike. Von Ascherbach realizes he's in love for the first time in his pinched, narrow life, and it's with a 14-year-old boy; his response is to make himself ridiculous, following the kid around, staying in his Venetian Garden of Eros despite knowing for sure there's a cholera epidemic, despite being warned of the dangers of staying, despite smelling decay and death and miasmic uccchiness all around, because he's in love. But with the wrong kind of person...a male. Therefore Mann makes him pay the ultimate price, he loses his life because he gives in and falls hopelessly, stupidly in love. With a male. Mann makes his judgment of this moral turpitude even more explicit by making it a chaste, though to modern eyes not unrequited, love between an old man and a boy. Explicit references to Classical culture aside, the entire atmosphere of the novel is quite evidently designed to point up the absurdity and the impossibility of such a love being rewarding or rewarded. It's not in the least mysterious what Mann's after: Denial, denial, denial! It's your only salvation, faggots! Deny yourself, don't let yourself feel anything rather than feel *that*!This book offends my sensibilities. Gorgeously built images and sonorously elegant sentences earn it all of its points.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Oh so tragic and rather melodramatic...or maybe I'm just remembering the 1971 Luchino Visconti movie version?A man longing to regain the vitality and vigor of youth, goes on holiday and turns ghoulish at the sight of a young Adonis. Death in Venice walks the line of appreciation and pedophilia. Having no problem with homosexuality, but not being down with the man-boy love thing, I cringed more than once. \"Don't cross the invisible line!\" I may have shouted in my head more than once while reading, definitely while watching.But if you can move beyond the physical, and I did, Death in Venice truly captures the essence of an old, decrepit man trying to recapture the essence of youth. I understood the meaning when I read/watched this as a early 20 something. As a middle-aged man with my aches, pains and regrets, I truly understand the main character's \"desire\" deep down in my soul.

Writing had overstimulated him and he needs clarity. As with many German intellects of the early 20th century, his mind had been feasting on the classicism of his surroundings, when he came across a displeasing red-haired man. A strange emotion stirred within him, an emotion he pondered on before he later identified it as a desire to travel. He had been too preoccupied with the duties imposed on him by the collective European psyche. He needed change, so heads to Venice.Venice was not enshrined in sun when the ferry docked, a disturbing insult to his aesthetics, and Aschenbach's mood was not improved when a contumacious, red-haired gondolier imposed his services on him. Quite naturally his thoughts turned to death. And death really pays as the main theme here, He disembarked at the Hotel on the Lido and was reassured to hear the sounds of all the major world languages. And Polish. As he was waiting for dinner he spotted three austere, expressionless girls with their extremely beautiful 14-year-old brother. He went to sleep in a transport of delight and entered a dreamland where he was a great deal more active than he ever was awake.Aschenbach would spend the rest of his stay, studying with passionate observations, the boy, Tadzio, in all his god-like physique, he is fascinated by the boy's dashing good looks, watching on in a state of euphoria, while a calm washes over him. He has never felt so in love.But by his forth week's stay, rumours are circulating there is sickness in the city, he doesn't want to leave. He starts to follow Tadzio more openly, he learned there was a cholera epidemic but still he could not bring himself to tell Tadzio's mother, but can't tear away from his burning infatuation. He started to feel ghastly on the beach whilst gazing across the sand at Tadzio, Was he beckoning him?. Crushed by the weight of the symbolism, he wouldn't rise again.This by Novella standards is quite rightly regarded as a classic of German literature, reading the second time around didn't strike me as much as the first, so have knocked a star of my rating,but it's very well written, and I don't understand the criticism, but then no one book is going to please everybody. 4/5"}, {"userName": "Bram", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1797553-bram", "userReview": "I bet someone could write a masterpiece by taking this book\u2019s premise and elongating it into a fuller exploration of the child-adult love taboo. Oh, really? Oh.This book really does read like a Lolita written 40 years prior with Lo\u2019s gender switched and a premature ending just before things get really interesting (if you know what I mean). Death in Venice is equally engrossing and sports a protagonist, Aschenbach, who\u2019s as well developed, far more relatable, and nearly as interesting as our dear Humbert Humbert. The novel does feel cut-off though, as if Mann were afraid to explore the tale any further, and it also includes a not-so-faint whiff of moralizing that\u2019s rather absent in Nabokov\u2019s version. Aschenbach\u2019s portrayal as a driven, successful, and now weary late middle-aged writer is so convincing that I was surprised to learn that Mann wrote this in his mid-30s. The characterization\u2019s so good, in fact, that I was sure it had to be mostly autobiographical. Maybe, maybe not. Either way, it\u2019s damn good writing that\u2019s on display for too few pages.

This famous/infamous novella is about a writer in his 50s who falls in love with a 14 year old boy who is staying in his hotel whilst he is on holiday in Venice. The story is highly descriptive and internal (Gustav von Aschenbach, the writer, is not a talkative chap, he doesn't even speak to his beloved, Tadzio).Mann himself wrote that he wanted to portray the passion as confusion and degradation and he does this very effectively using the symbolism of Greek philosophy; especially Apollo and Dioysius in opposition; Apollo representing the intellect and repressed emotion and Dionysius representing passion and the opposite of reason. Aschenbach has lived in the realm of intellect and reason; unreason intrudes (the red haired man at the beginning of the book) and Aschenbach travels to Venice to holiday. He appears surprised by the intrusion of passion and struggles to understand and cope with it. As Aschenbach becomes more obsessed his decline is described. Early in the book he sees an older man with a group of younger men; the older man is heavily made up to look younger and revolts Aschenbach. He later becomes what he is revolted by. The symbol of cholera ravaging the heart of Venice, secretly, is mirrored in the destructive passion and in the obsession leading to Aschenbach staying in Venice and dying of cholera (it does feel like Mann really does not like Aschenbach). The influences of Freud and Nietzsche are clear and there are lots of Platonic references. This is a powerful portrayal of doomed and distorted obsession. Mann got the idea when he was in Venice with his family and saw a young Polish boy with his family. He was also a fan of Mahler, who died very suddenly just before Mann conceived the tale. The analysis of passion is stark; Aschenbach gains nothing from it, he becomes ridiculous, diseased and increasingly self-deceiving. Aschenbach does not realise there is a sexual element to his desire until a vivid dream towards the end of the book; that realisation does not lead to direct action on his desires (he still sits on the beach and watches or follows the family at a distance around Venice), but more directly to the onset of the disease and decay. Contrast with the horrific current revelations about Jimmy Saville; he acted out all of his fantasies with no repression. I cannot imagine Aschenbach having an epitaph on his grave saying \"It was good while it lasted\" like Saville did (Unfortunately we now know what he meant).This novella is well worth reading for Mann's analysis of destructive passion and it is very thought provoking."}, {"userName": "J.G.

Mann's succinct and powerful images are always reversed: the raw and brutal emotion herein is become feral, mitigated only by how it twists back upon itself as only such a morally indistinct, labyrinthine mass may so twist.Eminently pleasing and disturbing, this battle between the barely-restrained Epicurean and the resignedly Absurdist meets the latter's comic fruition in the former's faux-tragic inaccessibility."}, {"userName": "\u0641\u0647\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0647\u062f", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5008212", "userReview": "\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u062a \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0642\u064a\u0629 \u062a\u0648\u0645\u0627\u0633 \u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0626\u064a\u064a\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0646\u062a \u0623\u062a\u0647\u064a\u0628\u0647\u0645\u060c \u0631\u0628\u0645\u0627 \u0644\u0623\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0636\u062e\u0645\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0623\u063a\u0644\u0628\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0644\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0648\u062c\u062f\u062a \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u062e\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u063a\u064a\u0631 \u0644\u0647\u060c \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0643\u062a\u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u062a\u0623\u062b\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0628\u0632\u064a\u0627\u0631\u0629 \u0642\u0627\u0645 \u0628\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0639 \u0632\u0648\u062c\u062a\u0647 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0642\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0644\u0627\u062d\u0638 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0624\u0644\u0641 \u0648\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0639 \u0628\u0635\u0628\u064a \u0628\u0637\u0631\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u063a\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0629\u060c \u0623\u064a\u0642\u0638\u062a \u0641\u064a \u062f\u0627\u062e\u0644\u0647 \u062d\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0646\u0627\u0646 \u0648\u0631\u063a\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0646\u0635 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u062d\u0638\u0629 \u0648\u062a\u062d\u0648\u064a\u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0647\u0643\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u0628\u062a\u062f\u0639 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0626\u064a\u0627\u064b \u0645\u0634\u0647\u0648\u0631\u0627\u064b \u0628\u0627\u0633\u0645 (\u062c\u0648\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0641 \u0622\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0627\u062e)\u060c \u064a\u062a\u0648\u0642\u0641 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0641\u064a \u0644\u062d\u0638\u0629 \u0644\u0645 \u064a\u062e\u0637\u0637 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u062a\u062d\u062a \u0645\u0631\u0623\u0649 \u0631\u062c\u0644 \u0631\u062d\u0627\u0644 \u0639\u0646 \u0631\u0648\u062a\u064a\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0627\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645\u064a\u060c \u0648\u064a\u0642\u0631\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0641\u0631\u060c \u0647\u0643\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u0632\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0642\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0644\u064a\u0641\u062a\u062a\u0646 \u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0628\u0635\u0628\u064a \u0628\u0648\u0644\u0646\u062f\u064a \u064a\u062f\u0639\u0649 \u062a\u0627\u062f\u0632\u064a\u0648\u060c \u0644\u064a\u0641\u0642\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631 \u0639\u0642\u0644\u0627\u0646\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0641\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0628\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u064a\u0636\u0631\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0642\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0648\u064a\u0641\u0642\u062f \u062d\u0633\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0644\u064a\u0645 \u0641\u064a\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0628\u0649 \u0643\u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0635\u0627\u0628\u0649 \u0639\u062c\u0648\u0632 \u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0647 \u0622\u0634\u0646\u0628\u0627\u062e \u0648\u0627\u062d\u062a\u0642\u0631\u0647 \u0623\u0648\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u0648\u0635\u0644 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0642\u064a\u0629\u060c \u0625\u0646\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0627\u0641\u062a\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0627\u0644 \u0645\u0627 \u064a\u062c\u0639\u0644 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u0626\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0646\u0636\u0628\u0637 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0627\u0641 \u064a\u062a\u0631\u062f\u0649 \u0648\u064a\u0641\u0642\u062f \u0630\u0627\u062a\u0647 \u0648\u0631\u0648\u062d\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0646\u062f\u0642\u064a\u0629"}, {"userName": "Rowena", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena", "userReview": "I would probably give this book a 3.5 star rating.

My main impression of the relatively recent translation by Michael Henry Heim (2004) is that it preserves the author\u2019s long-winded and intricate sentence structure. Unpacking Mann\u2019s sentences is one of the challenges of reading his books. Stylistically, therefore, the translation is quite authentic. As I read the novella, I looked for clues supporting the literary analysis I remember from my class discussion so long ago. They were not hard to find. Death in Venice is autobiographical to the extent that it reflects Mann\u2019s own parentage. His father was an austere, disciplined northern German, while his mother had a southern European heritage and a passionate nature. In fact, J\u00falia da Silva Bruhns was born in Rio de Janeiro and was the daughter of a plantation owner with a Portuguese background. Mann's father, Thomas Johann Heinrich Mann, met her in Brazil because the grandfather had established an export business there. (Source: Philipp Hauer, Herkunft und Lebensverh\u00e4ltnisse der Eltern und Gro\u00dfeltern der Br\u00fcder Heinrich und Thomas Mann, October 29, 2007, http://www.philipphauer.de/info/d/elt...).Thus both the author and the protagonist in Death in Venice, Gustav von Aschenbach, experienced continual tension between both sets of inherited traits\u2014the Apollonian and Dionysian ideals embodied by the parents. The interplay between these conflicting tendencies gave rise to a successful artist, who combined an appreciation for Dionysian joys and sensitivities with Apollonian respect for structure and hard work. It is worth noting that in the novella, von Aschenbach is an author, whereas in the film he is a composer.Venice represents physical decay and personal dissolution. As his life nears its end, von Aschenbach loses his self-control, as he finally yields to temptation and long-repressed urges. During his fateful sojourn in Venice, he nevertheless manages to produce a short essay about beauty. Of course, the readers do not suspect that the inspiration for this work is the elderly and sickly man\u2019s infatuation with a 14-year-old boy.A few excerpts follow.About the decision to go on vacation:\u201cYet he knew only too well the source of the sudden temptation. It was an urge to flee\u2014he fully admitted it, this yearning for freedom, release, oblivion\u2014an urge to flee his work, the humdrum routine of a rigid, cold, passionate duty.\u201dAbout lineage and art:\u201c\u2026a strain of more impetuous, sensual blood had found its way into the family in the previous generation through the writer\u2019s mother, the daughter of a Bohemian bandmaster. She was the source of the foreign racial features in his appearance. It was the union of the father\u2019s sober, conscientious nature with the darker, more fiery impulses of the mother that engendered the artist\u2014and this particular artist.\u201d\u201cWishing to bear on such frail shoulders the burdens imposed by his talent and wishing to go far, he had great need of discipline, and discipline was fortunately an inborn quality he had inherited from his father\u2019s side of the family.\u201d\u201cAschenbach did not care for pleasure. Whenever and wherever he was called upon to let his hair down, take things easy, enjoy himself, he soon\u2014especially in his younger years\u2014felt restless and ill at ease and could not wait to return to his noble travail, the sober sanctuary of his daily routine. It was the only place that could enchant him, relax his will, make him happy.\u201dAlso worth noting is that von Aschenbach tries to leave (escape from) Venice and its temptations, but instead decides to stay behind due to a coincidence: a trunk with his possessions is shipped ahead to Como instead of a resort near Trieste, where he had planned to resume his vacation. This fortuitous turn of events foils his attempt to return to a balanced life of self-abnegation and artistic production, but the dissolute old man is secretly overjoyed because he can continue to devote himself to his obsession. Venice has entrapped and ensnared him. This same theme of entrapment reoccurs in Mann\u2019s similarly autobiographical later novel, The Magic Mountain, which is set in a sanatorium in Switzerland. Visitors there contract tuberculosis and therefore must remain for treatment. Mann\u2019s wife stayed at such a facility in Davos."}, {"userName": "Parastoo Ashtian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22635681-parastoo-ashtian", "userReview": "\u0628\u0631\u0627\u06cc \u0622\u0646\u06a9\u0647 \u0645\u062d\u0635\u0648\u0644 \u0647\u0646\u0631\u06cc \u06af\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0642\u062f\u0631\u06cc \u0622\u0646\u0627 \u062a\u0627\u062b\u06cc\u0631 \u0648\u0633\u06cc\u0639 \u0639\u0645\u06cc\u0642\u06cc \u0627\u0632 \u062e\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0647 \u062c\u0627 \u06af\u0630\u0627\u0631\u062f\u060c \u0628\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0627\u0631\u062a\u0628\u0627\u0637\u060c \u0628\u0644\u06a9\u0647 \u062a\u0648\u0627\u0641\u0642\u06cc \u067e\u0646\u0647\u0627\u0646\u06cc \u0645\u06cc\u0627\u0646 \u0633\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc \u0622\u0641\u0631\u06cc\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647\u200c\u0627\u0634 \u0648 \u0633\u0631\u0646\u0648\u0634\u062a \u062c\u0645\u0639\u06cc \u0646\u0633\u0644 \u0645\u0639\u0627\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0648 \u0648\u062c\u0648\u062f \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a\u0647 \u0628\u0627\u0634\u062f.\u0627\u0632 \u0645\u062a\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628"}, {"userName": "Vanita", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4120893-vanita", "userReview": "Despertei a vontade de ler este livro por causa de um filme com a Marion Cottilard que nada tinha que ver com a trama de Thomas Mann.

Mas, vamos ao que interessa, e a hist\u00f3ria?Ora bem, todos sabemos que isto da beleza \u00e9 altamente subjectivo. Mas, quantos de n\u00f3s n\u00e3o ficaram j\u00e1 - talvez algures no passado - fascinados com a ideia de Veneza? Uma cidade italiana feita de canais \u00e9 quase imbat\u00edvel no que diz respeito a cen\u00e1rios para deixar a mente deambular. Agora imaginem que a escrita de Thomas Mann, estranhamente, vos leva ao colo, com a destreza de um ser invis\u00edvel, e vos faz viajar pela ang\u00fastia que tudo o que \u00e9 belo nos provoca. Deixem-se enlevar no feiti\u00e7o com que a perfei\u00e7\u00e3o nos encanta e vistam a pele de um velho \u00e0s portas da morte, deliciado com a \u00eaxtase da beleza ef\u00e9mera. \u00c9 isto \"A Morte em Veneza\".H\u00e1 quem veja este livro como a descri\u00e7\u00e3o de uma rela\u00e7\u00e3o homossexual plat\u00f3nica. Eu acredito que \u00e9 tudo menos isso. Para mim, Thomas Mann reflecte sobre o encanto da juventude - a passageira juventude - nos \u00faltimos momentos de vida de um velho que nunca pensou algum dia ver-se encerrado num corpo fl\u00e1cido e idoso. A beleza da cidade contrasta com o cheiro putrefacto da doen\u00e7a, numa alus\u00e3o \u00e0 hist\u00f3ria que une estes dois seres. L\u00ea-se num piscar de olhos mas fica para sempre.
