They're so beautiful. I cannot wait to get my hands on this book!! :)___This series always seems to somehow entrap me in its pages. I read Taken At Dusk in a matter of hours and I loved every moment of it. We are back at Shadow Falls and Kylie is still trying to process everything that has happened to her with the vampires. Things are never quiet for Kylie though, soon a women who cannot seem to remember who she is, is stalking Kylie and bringing a grave warning. And with that warning eerie things are beginning to happen. With the boy situation... how do you chose over two amazing, and sexy, guys who love you? Well, Kylie decides to give Lucas a chance but, his pack may stand in their way. Other than that chaos, Kylie is desperate to figure out who she is and she just may be getting closer. But when some truths are revealed will Kylie be ready to hear the answer?Taken At Dusk is full of thrills and some twists that I honestly didn't see coming. I simply cannot get enough of Kylie's reality. I love how C.C. Hunter made her supernaturals and each lore that goes along with them. For some reason, a lot of characters really stood out for me in this installment. I found myself adoring Della and her wittiness. And, Perry... oh my gosh that boy can make you laugh. Even the new character, Ellie. I wanted to hate her and at first I did. But, she grows on you so quickly, and I ended loving the role she played.And finally the boys. I've been constantly on the fence (even though I leaned toward Lucas), and I have to say I think I'm still sitting on that fence! I don't know how C.C. does it! But, there are things about both boys that you fall in love with and things about both boys that you want to kick them for. I must say, I was extremely happy with what happened with Kylie and Lucas in this one. I found myself enjoying their story line. But, Derek is still there and the things he does just make you want to root for him too. I am so excited to see what C.C. decides to do with these two fine fellas, because I love them both.I always get so pulled into these stories that I feel completely sad when they're over. These books make you laugh, they make your stomach drop, overall they have an ease of trapping you in the story from beginning to end. I just want to know what happens next! I want to know what Kylie completely is! I want to laugh more with Della, Miranda, and Perry! I want more sexy times with Derek and Lucas! All I know is that C.C. Hunter definitely did not disappoint with this one! And I cannot wait for Whispers At Moonrise!!"}, {"userName": "Krissysch", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47371791-krissysch", "userReview": "Bisher mein Lieblingsband der Reihe!"}, {"userName": "Lalaine *myficbookreviews*", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4972017-lalaine-myficbookreviews", "userReview": "\"Life's hard. Love's harder.\" I was so excited when I finally was able to read this book early, and as always, CC Hunter never fails to amaze me with her story-telling, I just loved this series. And I liked the new characters and mystery she added that has kept me more interested. So the story deals with Kylie, who is trying to figure out what she really is and trying to fit where she really belong in this new world she found. Kylie seemed to grow more through out the story which is really really good. But her feelings for these two hot guys - charming fae Derek and badass werewolf Lucas- are still floating. Well if you ask me, dunno who to pick! I'm crazy over Lucas but I'm also fond of Derek. He grew on me from the second book so its kind of difficult to choose for Kylie right now. We will see how it goes, lets hope that CC would really pull this one up neatly. I also loved the side characters around Kylie, CC really did a great job creating a story that doesnt only revolves with our protagonist(self-discovery) but also extended to her supporting characters. Oh, and I really really think Della(the vampire) is a kickass. I loved her!The plot twists were intriguing, there were a right amount of mystery, tension, laugh out loud moments, romance and emotional scenes. Overall, I really really liked this book, this is the kind of book/series that every teenagers should read, Kylie is really a great protagonist, although flawed, but great. There are more questions that needs an answers so cant wait for the fourth installment!Lines I loved:  \u201cThing is, those two sort of go hand in hand.

No one is perfect.\u201d \u201cAnd what if you can\u2019t?\u201d Kylie watched a bee buzz past her. \u201cWhat if I can\u2019t ever really forgive him?\u201d \u201cThen you let go,\u201d she said. \"There are no guarantees,\u201d Kylie countered. \u201cNot with love or with life.

She repeated that same sentence over in over in the second book and now it's Derek fault because he couldn't stand watching her always thinking about Lucas or because he didn't stood by her side so she could keep hurting him and pushing him away?

Get ready for the spoilers.So we now know what Kylie Galen is. She is a\u2026wait for it\u2026yup, here it comes, oh God it\u2019s still so damn funny\u2026 A\u2026C-H-A-M-E-L-E-O-N! Yes! You read that right! She\u2019s a freaking lizard! Oh God! It actually took my brain a few seconds to come around the fact that what I read was the word \u201cchameleon\u201d. So jokes aside, it does seem to be the perfect name for her kind. She just realized from Red whose real name was Robertson that she is a different kind of supernatural that has the potential to change brain patterns and become whoever the hell they want. Red could become a vampire, or a werewolf or could shape-shift and his pattern could look all human like. But, that said, he wasn\u2019t all powerful as Kylie would be because he wasn\u2019t born at midnight like she was. So I guess her being born at midnight makes her a healer and a ghost-whisperer too. So, ummm, that was the main plot. There were a few deaths and I really wanna know whose ghost has decided to haunt her now, when the ghost is of a person who hasn\u2019t even died yet. So does that mean that she could get a glimpse of future and know who was gonna die? Well, now I should start mentioning the things that I actually liked. I liked how Burnett and Holiday might have made up in the end. I liked how that Jane Doe aka Heidi Summers happened to be Kylie\u2019s real grandmother. I feel that a real big fuss was created about the fake grandparents visit in the beginning of this book. The old man was truly her real grandfather! Although it still remains in question that how the hell did they disappear? And why did they go to the lengths of stealing and lying? Did he want to be sure about his son\u2019s death or the life that he thought his son never had cause his own wife had lied to him about it? That seems most likely to me. Anyways, what else did I like? I guess that\u2019s about it.Now, the things I didn\u2019t like. *cracks knuckles*Firstly, Kylie and her whining and talking about both Derek and Lucas pissed me off. She was less annoying than the previous books. At least she had the sense to focus on the current problems rather than only swooning over Lucas\u2019 kisses or thinking about Derek\u2019s betrayal. But mind you, there was still a lot of it. Secondly, Lucas was like this overly possessive guy who gets his way by barging into a girl\u2019s room and asking her for forgiveness by showering her with flowers or kisses. That might be the idea of romantic for some girls, but hey, a girl needs her space! And Lucas sure as hell didn\u2019t give that. Maybe he gave Kylie some sort of peace but then he didn\u2019t even understand her or her feelings and the way he got all jealous over Derek only when she took his side was just unacceptable. I didn\u2019t give him much thought in the previous books but then in this book, he downright annoyed me.Thirdly, Della and Mirinda are just shallow bitches with big foul mouths. I don\u2019t even like them. They might be all good in the heart or whatever, but I seriously don\u2019t see it. Della does seem to hate everything cause of how unfair life has been to her but I really don\u2019t take it up as an excuse for her behavior. Mirinda is just a hopeless case. I mean why did she have to make poor Perry suffer for that long? I wish Perry had a crush on someone else. Fourthly, I disliked the lack of action in this book. The secrets kept on building and it was like stocking up crackers for the fireworks but then instead of a bang in the end, it was nothing but a dying fizz. There wasn\u2019t much that happened in this book if you come to think of it. Derek was kept in the sidelines whereas in the second book and most of the first he was made out to be the real deal. There was not much meaning to Lucas and Kylie\u2019s relationship other than sucking faces as Della so kindly puts it. Kylie finds out about her real grandparents. A new character comes and dies. Red comes up and becomes the hero. Kylie finds out that she is a lizard. Still hilarious, I know. Nothing significant, now was it? So I\u2019m not sure if I wanna rate it 3. I guess I\u2019ll go for 2.5."}, {"userName": "Gigi Hudson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2890138-gigi-hudson", "userReview": "(This review features spoilers.) I really hate this series. I'd hoped that it would get better, but it hasn't. The writing is awful at best and the plot line is either her gushing about a guy, her moaning about her life, or her not being able to make her mind up. Sometimes all at the same time! No but really this book series is abysmal. She just started saying about how her mum should forgive her dad for cheating on her. Quite simply, fuck off. The fact that she couldn't forgive the guy she flirted with a bit for having sex with his ex girlfriend when he saw her again, despite the fact that he was not dating Kylie at the time, or indeed ever had dated her, is just fucking ridiculous. THEY NEVER DATED.THEY JUST HOOKED UP A BIT.THEN SHE IGNORED HIM AND BLANKED HIM FOR NO REASON.THEN HE LEFT.THEN HE HAD SEX WITH HIS EX GIRLFRIEND.NOW SHE WON'T TALK TO HIM AND IS ANGRY....what. And yet she thinks that her (step)dad, who carried out an affair with a very young intern behind her mothers back, should be forgiven? No I'm sorry Kylie, you don't need to come down from that high horse, you need to be DRAGGED. And not to mention her old best friend was DYING OF CANCER and even though she thinks she's cured her, she couldn't be assed to even check? Really? Class A bitch act you've got going on here. And I genuinely cannot even talk about the boy situation here, she is utterly ridiculous. If a girl acted like this in real life both guys would dump her ass and move on. And if a guy did this to her she would be \"heartbroken\" and angsty as fuck. Stop with the damned double standards. Really to summarise, I gave the first book a chance. It was bad, but had potential. I figured it was a debut novel and the sloppiness/lack of talent would be things improved by experience and finding a decent editor. Instead, the writing went downhill. Oh. The second book was awful in the extreme, with random plot lines springing into action put of nowhere and disappearing again. The other characters have NO backstory what do ever, and the lack of physical descriptions is just disgusting. The characters, with the SOLE exception of the main one, (and her two love interests), feel like 2D cardboard cutouts. Even the love interests, Derek and Lucas have not been given much detail. Derek doesn't have a last name or a general physical description (what the fuck is his hair colour?) and Lucas doesn't have an personality besides dominant and overbearing. Literally, she doesn't know anything about either of them really. Expect that \"their hugs are wonderful and they are like soooo buff!\" And on the subject of hair colour still, the author regularly reminds us of Miranda's coloured hair, but the thing is...she never mentions what fucking colours are in her hair. Or whether it's all over coloured or just highlighted. It's confusing and whilst the story is not all about the characters looks, of course, being able to actually build a mental picture of the main characters is rather a prerequisite. So overall, this is a real failure in the publishing world."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5449940-wendy", "userReview": "HURRY UP AND RELEASE IT!!!!"}, {"userName": "\u2018Jennifer | Wortgetreu", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31890936-jennifer-wortgetreu", "userReview": "Ich kann keine Sterne daf\u00fcr vergeben, da ich das Buch abgebrochen habe.

Quite a few things were going on but because there was so much focus on Kylie's boy drama and on her moaning about what sort of supernatural she was, I just lost interest after a few chapters.Kylie was dull \u2014 she spent all her time moaning about Lucas/Derek and her powers/identity. She also spent a lot of time bitching about Derek and Lucas' ex's and calling them sluts just because she was a bitter, frigid bitch herself.Worst of all, Kylie was a Mary Sue - she had no less than 3 guys declaring their love for her, her powers were speshul and everyone thought she was a speshul snowflake. There was nothing speshul about her except that she was a speshul kind of stupid.Lucas was a controlling, secretive fucker. I don't think he even likes Kylie all that much he only wants her because she's forbidden since his pack/family don't want him dating anyone but a werewolf and she just so happened to be the only girl dumb enough to swallow all his bullshit. I hated Lucas a lot - I don't how anyone could think he's a good guy when he had sex with Fredericka once and then basically told her to piss off \u2014 he knew Fredericka had feelings for him and wanted to date him but he thought it was cool just to use her for her sex and then throw her aside like she wasn't good enough for him. He didn't care about her feelings and wasn't bothered that he hurt her \u2014 he's a dick and a douchebag yet he goes around acting like a decent, caring, respectful guy.Derek was a weak bastard \u2014 he couldn't handle that Kylie had confusing feelings for Lucas so he dumped her, then abandoned her, then he slept with some other girl a few days later and then he came back and was all over her again..WTF?! He made his decision to fuck off and have sex with his ex \u2014 he has no right to interfere in her life again.Kylie's relationship with both Lucas and Derek lacked chemistry, Miranda/Perry's and Holiday/Burnett's relationships made more sense and were far more engaging.Kylie thinks all her love interests ex's are sluts because they had sex with them. She looks down at her best friend because she enjoys sex, she looks down at Ellie for sleeping with Derek even though they were single and had a history together and she had no idea Kylie even existed, she looks down at Fredericka because she had sex with Lucas even though Fredericka was in love with Lucas. She doesn't think Lucas was a slut for sleeping with Fredericka when he didn't have feelings for her and she didn't think badly of Derek sleeping with Ellie when he still had feelings for her. No, her boys can do no wrong when they were the ones who shouldn't have had sex in the first place since they felt nothing for the girls they slept with, yet she thinks Fredericka, Ellie and Sara are the evul whores. Boring plot, rubbish characters and ridiculous romance = A disappointing read. Most of all, I'm sick of Kylie's frigid, Mary Sue, judgmental attitude \u2014 she needs to get over herself."}, {"userName": "Khelsey Jackson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5126519-khelsey-jackson", "userReview": "Kylie Galen has been though a lot and she is getting tired of it.

She takes on quite the roller coaster ride in this book. With the ghost that is warning Kylie that one lives and one dies, to the FRU's 'tests', to the mystery behind who keeps saving her, leaves you with a very exciting read!It was so nice to finally get some answers. Not as much as I would have liked, but hey answers are answers. I'll take any at this point, whether their jaw dropping or not.You see a lot more in the relationship department in this book then you do in the firs two. It was AWESOME! I'm so glad that Perry and Miranda are finally starting to pull it together. It's about time that's all I've gotta say, they were driving me crazy! Kylie's still got her huge dilemma trying to choose between Derek and Lucas. Even though it seems that she's chosen Lucas, Derek's little confession at the end makes me think things are going to be quite interesting in the next book. Personally I'm rooting for Derek. He such an amazing guy. I think Kylie would be lucky to have him. Lucas is good too, but he's just a little too controlling for my taste. And, of course, how could I forget Burnett and Holiday!

C.C. Hunter does not disappoint with the next novel in the Shadow Falls series. I enjoyed the sense of mystery throughout Taken at Dusk and I\u2019m glad that although Hunter definitely answered several of my questions (which I\u2019ve been desparately asking for) she left me with some more to be answered in her next novel. After a long, but exciting wait we finally find out what Kylie is! (Yay!) I think my favorite part about this book is that we finally see some of the relationships from the previous novels develop and begin. I highly recommend picking up the previous novels to this series and reading them before Taken at Dusk. Although it\u2019s a great book I don\u2019t think readers will understand or appreciate certain aspects of the story without reading them. I wasn't surprised when I couldn\u2019t put this book down, it was addicting and another great addition to the series! I was thrilled to see more of Lucas and I loved that his character really opened up in this book. (Yeah, I\u2019m Team Lucas!) No need to worry about Derek! Readers will be pleasantly suprised to find out about another surprise involving him. Overall, I think this paranormal series is one of my favorite ones. Kylie is a great example of a real, complicated, yet intriguing character. Hunter does a fanastic job not only building primary, but also secondary characters throughout the novel.

Pretty much. It's not like we got a clear definition, but at least we have a label of sorts. It's unexpected (because, I assume it's a completely made-up by the author thing, but I could be wrong), but it's something. We get some real action and some real life and death stuff, there seems to be a definite upping of the ante. Kylie now has a direction to focus in so there is real hope for faster paced plot progression in the future. I hope.The Bad: Kylie needs to swear off dudes. She's an awful person when it comes to dating. It's not that she can't decide between the two guys, it's that she gets one and then only wants the other. Then she gets the other and only wants the first one. And because of this manufactured boy drama, she can't be bothered to spend her time alerting adults to her issues, learning how to harness her abilities or protect herself from danger. The world revolves around her easily-bored heart and it's one of the single most annoy things I've ever read."}, {"userName": "Suzanne ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5952567-suzanne", "userReview": "4.5 starsAbsolutely brilliant :)\"I'm in love with you, Kylie.\" He looked almost embarrassed by the admission.

Taken at Dusk is the third book in this intense series and was as thrilling as usual. Taken at Dusk might be my favorite in the series so far.  Kylie is still in the dark but what kind of supernatural she is. Problems arise in Shadow Falls between the campers (soon to be students) and outsiders continue to cause problems. Taken at Dusk continues where Awake at Dawn left off. Kylie is still in love with Lucas and Derek, unable to choose between her two lovers. I really loved Holiday and Burnett in this book they are such a great couple and add so much to the story. Della was also fantastic in this book she was as funny as always.  C.C. Hunter is an amazing writer and keeps you clamoring for more Shadow Falls. I seriously am so happy that I have an ARC of Whispers of Moonrise because that cliffhanger killed me. I need to know more about Kylie's paranormal status. Fans of the previous Shadow Falls books certainly won't be disappointed. I am upset that soon Shadow Falls will be over but am excited at the perspective that C.C. Hunter has another upcoming series!4.5/5 Stars!"}, {"userName": "Kim Smiley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2242962-kim-smiley", "userReview": "It seems so long ago that I read the 2nd book in this series, I forgot the storyline with Kylie and her love triangle with Derek and Lucas. I guess I wanted her w/ Derek, but in this book I was wavering. Kylie still doesn't know what she is, and in this installment she is being visited by a woman with a shaved head with a huge scar on it, who is sometimes pregnant but doesn't know her name or what happened to her. her only message is \"one will live and one will die.\" So that's the big mystery of the book.That and Kylie needs someone to shadow her everywhere she goes because of strange things happening to her when she is alone. Like an eagle swooping down to grab a rattlesnake before it strikes her, or a deer running in front of her just as a bolt of lightning would've gotten her. Kylie is very much interested in finding out exactly what she is and also who she wants to be with. We do finally get some answers in this book, but wait! There is another in the series.This was a decent read and I'm sure I'll pick up book 4. I just wish they were a little more exciting for me to consider it a real page turner. I mean, I turned the pages, but with less eagerness and not so much of a \"i've got to know know\" feeling."}], "description": "Step into Shadow Falls, a camp for teens with supernatural powers.
