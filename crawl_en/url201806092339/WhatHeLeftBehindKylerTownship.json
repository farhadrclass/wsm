It was self-published without a proof-reader or editor. So for all things considered, I say good job Philena. I look forward to reading more of your stories. You put your heart into your writing."}], "description": "A profound tale of true heroism during a time of war and how one person's integrity actually outlives the words spoken. Thomas Cade wasn't just a soldier that lived and died by a code of honor. He was also a man that lived and died by his code of Christian honor. The book explores how he touched the lives of others in ways that had no end.", "title": "What He Left Behind (Kyler Township, #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17983189-what-he-left-behind", "average": 4.0, "cover": "", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6654111.T_M_Payne", "name": "T.M.
