I am appalled, angry, sad but also filled with admiration for this inncent man on death row for over thirty years, who managed to retain hope and love. Not that he never got angry, he did, but he still hung on, didn't give up. He had a best friend, Lester a childhood friend who never missed visits, a mother to whom he was her baby boy, always asking him when he would be coming home, and he had his faith in God. His first lawyer incompetent, fighting against a system prejudice that despite evidence to the contrary, would do anything for a conviction. He would also, eventually have Bryan Stevenson, the author of Just Mercy and his lawyers in the Equal justice initiative. In fact, Stevenson writes the forward in this book.That the criminal justice system in this country is evident just from what we see on our televisions. It seems always weekly men who have been in prison, serving long sentences are found innocent and released. This book makes this point perfectly clear. Even when the evidence was found to be faulty in his first trial, Hintons case was passed from Court to court. The amount of years this happened was beyond ridiculous, to me it was unconsciousable. During his time on death row, he started a book club, daydreamed his way out, to travel, pretend, allowing him the opportunity to escape mentally if he couldn't physically. Many books have left me teary eyed, but reading this book affected me so much I had tears running down my face more than once. All the things this man missed, the sorrows he endured, on being released the realization that the world had moved on in technology, and in other ways. Yet, he never lost his humanity, held on to his faith, but what he lost is beyond measure."}, {"userName": "Jennifer ~ TarHeelReader & Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32340179-jennifer-tarheelreader-traveling-sister", "userReview": "5 inspirational and unforgettable stars to The Sun Does Shine! \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f \ud83c\udf1f Anthony Ray Hinton was convicted of murder and spent 30 years on Death Row in Alabama. His cell was close enough to the execution block that all his senses knew when someone\u2019s time had come. Hinton\u2019s public defender was incompetent and so was the star witness in ballistics who happened to be blind in one eye and asked for help in doing his job. Add to that a district attorney with an axe to grind, an all white jury and judge, and racial tensions in Alabama, and Hinton was convicted of a crime he did not commit. While each day and year ticked by, Hinton never lost hope, and he was able to convince well-known attorney, Bryan Stevenson, to represent him. After jumping through all the hoops of our justice system, and several years later in doing so, the Supreme Court overturned the false conviction. At the very heart of this book is Hinton\u2019s merciful, steadfast spirit. In prison, he was known for his kindness and ability to make others laugh. Outside of prison, he spends his time advocating so that this doesn\u2019t happen to anyone else. If you need to feel uplifted, Hinton indomitably delivers. Thank you to Anthony Ray Hinton, St. Martin\u2019s Press, and Netgalley for the ARC for this inspiring book.

Strike that \u2014 it\u2019s a must read for everyone.The Sun Does Shine has a foreword by Bryan Stephenson, but it is written by Anthony Ray Hinton, an inmate who was on death row in Alabama for 30 years. Hinton was sentenced to death for murders he did not commit. He is black and was too poor to afford a lawyer who could properly represent him. And it took thirty years before he was able to convince the US Supreme Court that his first trial was unfair and hadn\u2019t allowed him to present clearly exculpatory evidence.What makes the book worth reading is Hinton himself. He is a force of nature. In his foreword, Stephenson mentions that even the guards were supportive of Hinton\u2019s plea for a new trial. And it\u2019s easy to see why. Despite being on death row, Hinton found a way to make the best of a terrible situation. He took the high road in difficult circumstances and looked for the humanity in everyone, including his fellow inmates. As just one example, he started a book club that led inmates who could barely read to talk about race and justice and other topics. He even became friends with the son of a well known white nationalist who was on death row for killing a black man.Hinton is very self reflective, and his book doesn\u2019t just share his story, but many of his thoughts about faith, his love for his mother and close friends who stuck by him, how to stay strong in difficult situations, the failures of the criminal justice system and the inhumanity of the death penalty. There is also a fair amount of humour in Hinton\u2019s book. Hinton clearly does this on purpose, at one point explaining that starting with humour is often a good way to put people at ease and get them to listen. Hinton is now 60 years old. He had a lot to say. His book is well worth reading. I don\u2019t share the depth of his religious faith, but it clearly has kept him going and fuelled his admirable ability to look forward. I listened to the audio version, which was really well done. Hinton doesn\u2019t read it, but it\u2019s read in a voice that is full of life and expression."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28397995-nancy", "userReview": "Last year I read Bryan Stevenson's book Just Mercy. It was crushing to read about a justice system based on convictions and political gain at the expense of innocent men. It led me to read I Can't Breathe by Matt Taibbi about the death of Earl Garner and also to Michelle Ko's Reading with Patrick. Each book is a moving account of the stories behind the Black Lives Matter movement. So when I saw that one of the Death Row inmates represented by Stevenson had written his own book I had to read it.Ray Hinton had a record and had paid his dues. He was working in a guarded facility when a murder took place, but an enemy in romance told police that he had seen Ray at the crime scene.Ray was poor. Ray was black. Ray had a record. With lousy representation, a partially blind expert witness in munitions, and the system stacked against him, he was convicted and sent to prison for murders he did not commit. The Sun Does Shine tells of his struggle for justice, his decline into anger and hatred, and how he found hope and acceptance. He became a model prisoner, befriending the other inmates and working to improve their lives. He asked for their food to be covered to keep out dust and insects. He asked for books to keep the inmates from dwelling on their problems. He started a book club. He kept up morale.Ray changed lives. A former KKK member who killed a black teenager called Ray his best friend.It was the continuing love of his mother and support of his best friend that kept Ray going for thirty years. Even after his mother passed, he heard her inspiring voice to keep fighting. Ray knew he had what many others on Death Row had lacked: a loving family and abiding faith.Bryan Stevenson was overworked but took on Ray's case. They had to fight the Alabama court system that would not accept the evidence that would prove Ray's innocence. When Ray was finally released he had lived on Death Row longer than he had been free. It was a shock; the world had changed. The first night of freedom he slept in the bathroom because the bedroom was too large and strange. He was given no compensation. He had no Social Security or pension or savings built up. He would have to work to support himself the rest of his life.I was devastated and I was inspired by Ray's story.

It is hard to describe the gamut of emotions I felt as I followed Anthony Ray Hinton\u2019s incredible story of having to spend 30 years on death row for a crime he didn\u2019t commit. Disgusted, appalled, angry, outraged \u2013 none of these words seem to be sufficient in relaying my feelings towards the blatant miscarriage of justice that was described in this book as well as towards a broken criminal justice system that goes out of its way to protect corrupt, prejudiced officials who have no qualms about convicting and putting innocent people to death not based on hard evidence, but rather based on the color of their skin. Facing a system that treats \u201cthe rich and guilty better than the poor and innocent,\u201d Hinton fought for decades to prove his innocence, encountering one setback after another, until finally, with the help of his attorney Bryan Stevenson, they were able to get the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the original conviction and grant him a new trial, after which the local district attorney in Alabama decided to drop the charges. Throughout his harrowing ordeal, Hinton was sustained by his faith in God, which helped him maintain hope, but most importantly, he was blessed with the unconditional love of his mother -- a remarkable woman who was the center of his universe and also his most steadfast cheerleader \u2013 as well as the unwavering support of his best friend Lester Bailey, who, for 30 years, never missed a single visit, driving 7 hours every Friday down to the prison to sit with Hinton and make sure he had everything he needed and also helping to take care of his beloved mother. Channeling the love he received from his family and friends, his own unique sense of humor, and also everything his mother taught him about life, Hinton was able to develop true friendships with his fellow inmates and even with some of the guards at the prison. Hinton\u2019s ability to forgive those who wronged him and, despite the circumstances, try to better the lives of his fellow inmates through humor and genuine compassion were nothing short of extraordinary. Most people in his situation would not have found the will to survive, but Hinton was different \u2013 his strong resolve and unbreakable spirit were essential in helping him survive the misery of his situation. Also, it must be said that I have nothing but the utmost admiration and respect for Hinton\u2019s attorney Bryan Stevenson \u2013 an extraordinary man who has dedicated his entire life to fighting for justice and equality for those who are poor, underprivileged, marginalized. In Hinton\u2019s case, Stevenson fought the courts tirelessly for 16 years, never giving up even when one court after another refused to admit the evidence that would exonerate Hinton, never backing down even in the face of blatant bias from the judges and prosecutors. Even now, as Stevenson continues to battle with the State of Alabama to get compensation for Hinton, it continues to be a struggle, this time with semantics, as the same inherently prejudiced bureaucratic system maintains that Hinton should not get compensated because the charges being \u201cdropped\u201d is not the same as an official declaration of innocence. This is one of the most powerful memoirs I\u2019ve read in a long time. Hinton\u2019s story is unforgettable, inspirational, and is one that I know will stay with me for a long time to come. Since his release, Hinton has become a motivational speaker and works with Bryan Stevenson\u2019s Equal Justice Initiative traveling around the world, going wherever he is invited to share his story, bringing awareness and also pushing for changes in this country\u2019s justice system in the hopes that this doesn\u2019t happen again to anyone. One of the saddest moments in the book was when Hinton\u2019s mother passed away from cancer in 2002 \u2013 this was a woman who had been his rock throughout his ordeal, the love of his life, someone who meant more to him than life itself, the one person who, from the moment her son was arrested, never wavered in her belief that her most beloved baby boy would return home. A bittersweet reunion in the end, as Hinton walked out of the jailhouse finally a free man, grateful that Lester and his family were there to greet him, but also knowing that the mother he adored did not live to see that moment. Despite what Hinton went through and knowing the deeply ingrained societal struggles with racial bias in that state, Hinton still chooses to live in Alabama, in the same house that his mother worked hard her entire life in order to buy so that he would have a home to go back to. Hinton\u2019s special bond with his remarkable mother was one part of his story that moved me deeply.Remarkable, inspiring, eye-opening, and ultimately uplifting, this is a memoir that EVERYONE needs to read, and urgently, given what is happening in our country currently. Bryan Stevenson puts it best in the Forward to this book where he writes: \u201cReading [Hinton\u2019s] story is difficult but necessary. We need to learn things about our criminal justice system, about the legacy of racial bias in America and the way it can blind us to just and fair treatment of people. We need to understand the dangers posed by the politics of fear and anger that create systems like our capital punishment system and the political dynamics that have made some courts and officials act so irresponsibly. We also need to learn about human dignity, about human worth and value. We need to think about the fact that we are all more than the worst thing we have done.\u201dReceived ARC from St. Martin\u2019s Press via NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3060349-karen", "userReview": "An incredible story! My heart hurt for Anthony Ray Hinton, an innocent man with extraordinary patience who sat on death row in a 5x7 ft cell for 30 years. This man missed half his life due to an unconscionable travesty of justice in Alabama\u2019s court system before finally being exonerated and set free in 2015 at 58 years old after a ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court. I don\u2019t know if I will ever be able to forget Ray\u2019s story. Surely, the Alabama Senate will find it in their hearts to compensate this man as a small token to right this egregious wrong?The fix was in from the start for Ray, a hard-working young black man living in racially charged Alabama. It infuriates me that people today use the \u2018racist\u2019 card when a behavior doesn\u2019t suit them and have no idea what true racism is. Anthony Ray Hinton can educate them on that. \u201cYou know, I don\u2019t care whether you did or didn\u2019t do it. In fact, I believe you didn\u2019t do it. But it doesn\u2019t matter. If you didn\u2019t do it, one of your brothers did. And you\u2019re going to take the rap,\u201d said District Attorney of Birmingham, David Barber as he interrogated Ray.The cards were stacked against Ray - a white witness carrying a grudge, a white district attorney, a white judge, a white jury. Nobody cared about the truth. Mix in an incompetent public defender and a ballistics expert blind in one eye who had trouble working the microscope and asked for help doing his job who would be crucified on the stand by the prosecutor.30 years in a cell nearby the room where 53 death row inmates were executed, I cannot imagine the psychological effects of being exposed long term to this barbaric practice, hearing anguished pleas, smelling burning flesh and urine\u2026simply beyond comprehension. I was overwhelmed just thinking about it and the strength it must have taken to survive 30 years of this! I recently saw an interview of Ray, who seems to have no hate in his heart or carry a grudge. I am so inspired by his amazing spirit yet grieve for his loss of everything he\u2019s missed out on over the years since back when Reagan was president including the love of his life, his mother, dying while he was still in prison.Attorney Bryan Stevenson is a shining star, a man who for years has steadfastly dedicated his life to the less fortunate and incarcerated and who fought for decades with his staff to get Ray his freedom.

His crime? Nothing more than being born black and poor in Alabama. He was convicted of the robbery, kidnap and attempted murder of one man, and the brutal murder of two others in a short period of time. Similar robbery killings continued after he was locked up, but no one cared. All but the fact that he had an excellent alibi for the night of the crime that he went to trial for. He was locked in a warehouse surrounded by a 15' fence topped with razor wire, doing jobs with other men, mostly driving a forklift. They had a guard that signed them in and out, miles away from the crime scene. This book is a tough story of a long struggle yet filled with inspiration at the same time, as Anthony finds ways to remain strong during his time on death row.

Despite the fact that he had a solid alibi, and was in fact innocent of all charges, Hinton was found guilty and sentenced to death in Holman State Prison. Hinton was only twenty-nine at the time and believed that soon his innocence would be proven. But year after year passed and he was no closer to reclaiming his freedom back. With the help of his dear friend Lester Bailey and attorney Bryan Stevenson, Hinton finally was freed after spending thirty years on death row. This is his incredible journey.I have no words. This book is just phenomenal. My emotions all over the place. Anthony Ray Hinton was on death row for as long as I have been alive. His crime? Being Black and poor. Hinton was tending to his mother's garden when he was arrested. Unaware of the charge, Hinton went with the officers and did not come back home. Accused of shooting a restaurant manager and of killing two others, Hinton denied any wrongdoing. Providing an alibi for the most recent attempt, that he was 15 miles away working in a secure facility, did nothing to sway the officers. With a white prosecutor with a chip on his shoulder, a white judge, a white jury and an incompetent lawyer Hinton was convicted. It did not matter that the gun found in his mother's home had not been fired in over two decades. Before there even was a trail, he was already guilty. Hinton spent the first 3 years behind bars in silence but the remaining 27 as one of the most vocal and beloved inmates (even by the officers). With wit and humour, Hinton soon established a rapport with his fellow prisioners. He knew that many of them were guilty of the crimes they were charged with but they became his family. His spirit was not crushed. Hinton never stopped believing in God or in the redemption of the human soul.One of the most profound and moving chapters for me was when Hinton described the book club. In discussing books with heavily charged race themes, he talks of the white and (former) KKK member that had lynched and killed a Black teen boy. This man was in a room with 6 black men \"with nothing to lose\" and yet all that happened was a deep and meaningful discussion. I did not expect to get emotional when this former KKK inmate was executed but the way Hinton tells it, it really touched me, made me shed tears. Hinton's greatest asset is his ability to forgive, quite a feat considering that people literally conspired against him to put in jail to die. I have to mention Lester Bailey, Hinton's best and most dear friend. Lester deserves an award. He never missed a visit, he looked after Hinton's mother and never turned his back to his friend. And what to say about Bryan Stevenson? He worked tirelessly for 15 years to free Hinton. I have so much respect for these three men. Do not walk, run to get this book. Intense, gripping, powerful, impacful and ultimately hopeful this is easily the best book I have read thus far this year. I know that I will not be forgetting it for a long time.

Anthony Ray Hinton was falsely convicted of two counts of murder in a travesty of justice in 1985. Subsequent appeals were further abortions in the courts. Why? Anthony Ray Hinton was a young, poor black man, who had broken the law before so in the \u201cwisdom\u201d of the Alabama judicial system, he was sentenced to death by electrocution. Almost three decades of his life was spent on Death Row, in spite of compelling evidence that proved he could not have been the killer. Almost three decades of the life he could have had were lost forever, the children he could have fathered, the love he could have shared, any potential for contributing to society at large, gone. Who knows, maybe he would have fathered the child who grew up to cure cancer or who led the world to true peace?What Mr. Hinton did was just as miraculous, he changed himself, he sought peace of mind, he sought knowledge and he brought people together in the name of hope and justice. He also found a man brave enough to say, I believe in you and I will fight for you when Attorney Bryan Stevenson took his case.Today, Anthony Ray Hinton is a free man. Today he advocates justice and forgiveness and he believes in a God who never gave him more than he could bear. He has written of his grueling journey to freedom so the world will not forget what hatred and injustice are. He has written a book filled with undying hope through all that was lost.

Anthony 'Ray' Hinton was happy living his life - caring for his mother, attending church, working a job he did not mind, and appeasing for the wrongs he had done as a young man. His only crime was being a black man in Alabama in the mid 80's. Ray was wrongly convicted of robbery and the murder of three men, with a gun that had not been fired in 25 years. This book, written by him, was his journey through the unjust Alabama justice system, his many lawyers and appeals and his confinement for 30 years on Death Row.

Anthony Ray Hinton was put on death row at age 29 for crimes he was completely innocent of. Eventually, he got Bryan Stevenson to work on his case. It took years of work and filings and pleadings, but eventually the Supreme Court reversed his conviction.What was so stunning about this book was how positive an outlook Ray had.

I seriously can not find any other words to express how I feel after reading this book. And even that doesn't do it justice. When I saw this book on here and read the description, I knew I had to read it. The Sun Does Shine is about a man, Anthony Ray Hinton, who was charged and arrested with two counts of capitol murder in Alabama. Anthony was only twenty-nine years old at the time. Hinton was stunned and confused. The only reasonable and logical explanation for this accusation was a case of mistaken identity. Hinton strongly believed that the truth would prove him to be innocent and would then set him free. But from the beginning, I knew that wasn't going to be the case. Hinton was a poor black man that had no money, lived in the South, and was living in a poor and unfair justice system. Due to that, Anthony was sentenced to death by electrocution. Anthony spent his first three years on Death Row at Holman State Prison. Anthony describes in his book that he felt how each prison was feeling while they were walking to their death. Not only that, but he felt angry and rage towards everyone that sent an innocent man to prison. But that didn't stop Anthony from living. He found a way to help others, himself, and just be a better man. One of the most heartbreaking things that I had to read in this book was that most of the men he helped \"transform,\" were eventually executed only a few feet away from. That broke my heart. A man worked so hard to help others for them only to be executed. But in 2015, from the help of civil rights attorneys and an author named Ryan Stevenson, he was released. This book shines light on so many important topics. For example, how the justice system was in the South for a black man. Not only a black man, but a poor, black man. It tells that story about a man who came out on top and came out a better man after his imprisonment. This is truly the most inspiring story I have ever read. Ands probably ever will read.

I cannot even begin to put to words how i feel about this innocent man who spent 30 yrs on death row for a crime he did not commit. It should never have happened, but sadly there's no doubt that there are more innocent people currently behind bars. Makes you wonder how many. I am so grateful that here in the UK we have no death penalty. The Jury system does need to change, even here in the UK. I would highly recommend this book, which was very well written.

If you believe in the need for a death sentence, I also suggest you read it with open eyes and ears. Actually, everyone should read Hinton\u2019s memoir, because it is in my opinion a necessary read on how broken the US justice system really is. And more: it is the story of how an innocent man spent nearly 30 years on Death Row in Alabama, and continued to fight for freedom when most people would have given up. Hinton is a true hero, a man who lived through hell year after year after year, and still manages to see so much positive in everything.Anthony Ray Hinton, Ray, was arrested and convicted of a crime he could not have committed, by a prejudiced judge, jury, and court-appointed attorney. The details of the case are abhorrent: no jury should EVER have deemed this man guilty of the crimes the police said he had committed. On top of this, his appeals were continuously thrown out, the state of Alabama obviously not interested in admitting that they had sentenced an innocent man to death. It wasn\u2019t until Bryan Stevenson started to work with Ray that things started to look up, but even then it took many more years for Ray\u2019s conviction to be thrown out the court and for him to be released.The Sun Does Shine is a memoir of 30 lost years, of absolute darkness, but it is also ultimately a story of hope, of love, of friendship and of forgiveness. Hinton\u2019s innate need to care for others is absolutely uplifting, and his ability to navigate through darkness to see the light in everything is remarkable. I don\u2019t believe that we have the right to sentence anyone to death, no matter the crime, and The Sun Does Shine has me all the more convinced that we need to fight so much harder to get it removed.As Ray mentions at the end of the book, we should assume that every 10th person currently on death row is innocent. Should we be able to live with that?The Sun Does Shine will be published by St. Martin\u2019s Press on Marc 27th.

It was moving. Hinton took advantage of the awful moment to tell those trying to convict them that he loves them and was praying for them. Every moment that Hinton spoke of his mother was touching. He loves and respects her greatly. I cannot speak highly enough of this book and of Hinton. He owns the things that he has done wrong, and does not allow his conviction to break his soul.

Somewhere in the middle of Ray's story about his 30 years on Alabama's death row, I realized he'd been wrongfully convicted while I was still in nursing school (1985). While he survived and watched 54 prisoners walk past his cell to be electrocuted, I graduated with a BS, worked a 20-year career, raised my kids, married again, built a house, and traveled. Ray stayed in his 5 x 8-foot cell 23 hours a day and fought for the truth. The enormity of the injustice is staggering. Convicted of two murders on false testimony, trumped-up ballistics reports, and underrepresented by a court-appointed lawyer, 29-year-old Ray was sentenced to death. It is only because of who he is as a person and an incredible lawyer who believed in him that the prosecution eventually dropped the charges. But it took the Supreme Court of the United States to make them do it. They have yet to apologize or compensate him for the lost years. While incarcerated Ray, at first filled with hate for everyone involved, learned to forgive. He became a model for others, formed a book club, and practiced compassion for others. The way he survived those endless days and nights is a most extraordinary tale. At the end of the book, there is a list of men sitting on death row in the United States as of March 2017. As Ray points out, statistics show that one out of every ten of them is innocent. The list is long. Too long. Read them all, he says, and pause at every tenth name and say\u2026\"innocent.\" I'd also like to give a shout out to Lara Love Hardin who helped Ray tell his story.

I have a weak spot for memoirs, and Anthony Ray Hinton's story is without doubt one that will be able to catch your attention straight away. I knew right from the start this wasn't going to be an easy read, but it is almost impossible to wrap your head around all that the author has had to go through during all that time. Powerful, infuriating, heartbreaking and with a dose of hope and forgiveness... The Sun Does Shine is one of the best true crime memoirs I have read to this date, and his story will stay with me for a long time. Why did this memoir have such an impact on me? Let's see if I can explain my reasons... In a nutshell, this memoir is about the life of a man who had to spend thirty years on death row despite being innocent and having a solid alibi. His crime? Being born poor and black in the South (Alabama), a place where he ended up being judged by the color of his skin and the money in his pocket instead of the simple fact he was guilty or not. This fact alone will be enough to enrage you, one infuriating detail of his case after the other causing sparks and making you want to scream and pull at your hairs. How is it possible that in 1985 things like this still happened? Incriminating an innocent man with a solid alibi, discriminating him and denying him his rights? It made me want to travel back in time and just tell those persons involved in his case what I really thought of them.\u00a0The Sun Does Shine talks about the author growing up as well as the difficulties he has had to face during his entire life, even long before he was wrongly convicted of a crime. Racial segregation and discrimination is an important element in this memoir, and even though Anthony Ray Hinton never points a direct finger at the guilty and even stresses he forgives them, it shows us readers just how wrong the system was and still is in Southern Alabama. It's a topic that has always touched me, and it is very well described in this memoir.But this memoir isn't just about injustice and racial discrimination. Like the author stresses, it is also about hope and forgiveness, which shines through in his writing and underlying message. His experience during all those years on death row is fascinating to read, as well as describing his personal relationships with fellow inmates and how the experience truly changes men. While I believe in punishment for those who have committed crimes, I don't think death row is a solution. Like Anthony Ray Hinton said, who are we to judge who is innocent and who deserves to die? And then I'm not even thinking about possibly innocent men and women killed because of a mistake during their trials. Anthony Ray Hinton's case shows us just how wrong things can go, sending an innocent man to spend thirty years of his life on death row. I'm truly impressed and inspired by his view of life and ability for forgiveness. I can recommend this memoir to everyone; it is a true eye-opener.In 1985, Anthony Ray Hinton was arrested and charged with robbery and two counts of capital murder in Alabama. Hinton was working the night the last robbery took place and had a solid alibi, so he knew it was a case of mistaken identity and believed the truth would soon set him free. But the fact that he was innocent didn't mean anything to those in charge of the trial, and with no money and simply being a poor black man in the South, he was sentenced to death soon after. He spent the first three years on Death Row at Holan State Prison without speaking a word to anyone except those who believe in his innocence. His initial anger and despair of being sent to his death as an innocent man changed when he realized he had to accept his fate, and he was determined to not only survive and prove his innocence, but also find a way to live on Death Row.Powerful, inspiring, infuriating, heartbreaking, but also full of hope and forgiveness. The Sun Does Shine shows us how racial discrimination and prejudice helped send an innocent man to death row and keep him there for thirty years despite solid proof of his innocence. The pure injustice of it all makes you want to scream, but both his case and experience is very well documented in this memoir and makes for a painful, but inspiring, intriguing and very powerful read. I'm truly impressed by his views on life and his ability to be able to forgive the unforgivable. Highly recommended!

Reform is necessary. I think the author raised wonderful questions worthy of discussion and attention. He drew attention to the holes in our justice system and those who seem to be railroaded by it.

I was wowed by his determination, his love of family, and his indomitable spirit. 5 stars for all of that. So why 3 stars and not the full 5? There was a lot of repetition in this.

Hinton's firsthand account of wrongful imprisonment which landed him on Death Row in spite of his innocence is an important read for us all.While the book can be an uneven reading experience due to the inclusion of legal documents and transcripts, I believe Hinton's story to be incredibly important and I'm so glad I was able to read it.Anthony Ray Hinton is one of the longest-serving condemned prisoners facing execution in America who was proven innocent and eventually released. He was arrested in 1985 and finally released from prison on April 3, 2015. He proclaimed his innocence the entire time and when you read about the case, there can be no dispute to that fact.\u00a0Hinton's\u00a0only crime was being born black and in Alabama. The people who sentenced Hinton to Death Row, from the witnesses who lied to the cops who arrested him without concrete proof to the DA and judge who decided his guilt before the trial even began, even his pro bono lawyer who kept asking for money, made me furious. This was racism in action and downright evil.Time and again the state repeatedly denied his petitions and blocked evidence. It didn't seem to care that he was innocent or that there were real issues with the case. Or that, you know, they'd essentially let a murderer go free.\u00a0Can you imagine how Hinton felt that whole time?Reading Hinton's experience gave me a much better understanding of what Death Row prisoners face and the reality was horrifying.During his time in prison, he watched 54 men walk past his door on the way to their execution. The execution chamber\u00a0was 30 feet from his cell. Hinton describes the smells, the sounds, the visceral experience of watching guards leading someone to their death knowing you might be next. Every time someone is taken to execution chamber, they bang on the bars and scream to let the person know they're not alone.\u00a0Hinton understandably feels a variety of emotions over his injustice. He spent the first three years in silence but eventually starts reaching out to fellow prisoners and realizes he can't let the state of AL steal his soul or humanity. He eventually was able to start a book club and that led to all prisoners being allowed to have two books.Hinton shows us the humanity of his\u00a0\u00a0fellow prisoners, who are \"so much more than what we had been reduced to\" p. 133.\u00a0When a prisoner's parent died, Ray passed him a cup of coffee and prisoners passed down candy and whatever food they had from the commissary. It was their way of expressing condolences. He doesn't deny there were men there who had done terrible things but he also has a lot of wisdom to share regarding how we view our fellow human beings regardless of what they've said and done.The Anthony Ray Hinton who went into prison is not the same man who emerges. My heart broke as he candidly discussed his fears about something like this happening again and the way he grappled with the men who did this to him.\u00a0He forgives McGregor, Perhacs, Acker, Judge Garrett and every attorney general who fought to keep the truth from being revealed, which is more than I would be capable of, especially because I'm sure Hinton was not the only person of color they did this to.If not for Bryan Stevenson's involvement, Hinton would either still be on Death Row or dead and all for a crime he never could have committed. If this does not convince you our criminal justice system needs a serious overhaul, I don't know what will.The Afterword includes a list of the men and women who sit on death row as of March 2017. He invites us to read each name and know statistically one out of every ten of them is innocent. I urge you not to skip this. I urge you to read Hinton's story and take his words to heart.\"The death penalty is broken, and you are either part of the death squad or you are banging on the bars.

Highly recommended as a book flight with Just Mercy (could read them in either order, as they approach the story from two different sides). Anthony Ray Hinton is not a perfect man, but he is sent to death row by a racially-biased judge, jury, and prosecutor for a crime he didn't commit. There is no evidence linking him to the case, the gun evidence is fabricated, and his own ballistics expert (the only one the state could afford to give his appointed attorney) is blind in one eye. Basically, it's a total clusterf*ck. Hinton is on death row for thirty years before being exonerated (this isn't a spoiler, as it's part of the introduction) and has to figure out how to live life in a small cell with death literally just a few feet from his door. This book is emotional, filled with faith, suffused with joy and hope, and just amazing on so many levels. There's an emotional hangover in it for you, if you're up for it, but even if you're not, it's worth putting on your shelf.

The tragic true story of Ray Hinson\u2019s conviction for a crime he didn\u2019t commit and the subsequent 29 years he spent in a 5x7 cell on death row in Alabama before he proved his innocence and won his release, however, will force society\u2019s eyes wide open. And it will be easy to do so, because Hinson tells an easy to follow, compassionate, shocking tale of what happened to him and how. Whether you come to this book with a curiosity about the injustices Hinson suffered or about the grace that he found and the faith that he followed, you\u2019ll come away impressed and transformed. This is a book of suffering, of violence, of broken hearts - and one of resilience, the power of love, and the meaning of faith as well. That Hinson was able not only to survive 30 years feet from a death chamber, but also thrive and transform many of the men he met during his incarceration speaks to this man\u2019s great good soul and tenacity. He fights not only for his innocence, but also for the reality that he and his peers are people: men of intellect, emotion, vice, and virtue. He unpacks and reframes the narrative of hate that dominates so many of the lives that end up on The Row. He refuses to judge his fellow inmates, and even his guards. His story speaks to multiple narratives: the experiences of young black men in the post-integration era South, the crippling legacies of racial apartheid and hate, the ways in which even the most open and powerful justice system in the world has been corrupted and repurposed for agendas that have nothing to do with justice. There are subtler stories, too - the difference between the southern black experience in 1985 vs 2015, the ways in which education and loved experience has grown flimsier and more brittle in many ways over the last 40 years, the shifting demographics of death row. There\u2019s anger and injustice in this book, but hilarity and love and hope, too. Despite spending much of his life in a 5x7 cell, Hinson offers his readers both an unfamiliar story and a thoroughly human one. Everyone should read this book. This is America writ small in 2018: a place of shame, hate, grace, complexity - and legacies that have yet to be decided."}], "description": "A powerful, revealing story of hope, love, justice, and the power of reading by a man who spent thirty years on death row for a crime he didn't commit.\n\n\"An amazing and heartwarming story, it restores our faith in the inherent goodness of humanity.\u201d\n- Archbishop Desmond Tutu\nIn 1985, Anthony Ray Hinton was arrested and charged with two counts of capital murder in Alabama. Stunned, confused, and only twenty-nine years old, Hinton knew that it was a case of mistaken identity and believed that the truth would prove his innocence and ultimately set him free. But with no money and a different system of justice for a poor black man in the South, Hinton was sentenced to death by electrocution. He spent his first three years on Death Row at Holman State Prison in agonizing silence\u2014full of despair and anger toward all those who had sent an innocent man to his death. But as Hinton realized and accepted his fate, he resolved not only to survive, but find a way to live on Death Row. For the next twenty-seven years he was a beacon\u2014transforming not only his own spirit, but those of his fellow inmates, fifty-four of whom were executed mere feet from his cell. With the help of civil rights attorney and bestselling author of Just Mercy, Bryan Stevenson, Hinton won his release in 2015.  With a foreword by Stevenson, The Sun Does Shine is an extraordinary testament to the power of hope sustained through the darkest times.
