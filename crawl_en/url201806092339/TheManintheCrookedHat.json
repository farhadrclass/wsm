Set in Detroit, Jack Pellum is an ex-cop whose wife Olivia was murdered. The reader, but not Pellum, knows from the first chapter that Olivia's murderer was Michael Underhill. The story is a search for the reason behind that murder. Pellum is now spending most of his time putting up flyers searching for a man in a crooked hat who he suspects is the killer. His suspicions lead him to several other crimes that might be linked to the man in the crooked hat. There is a pretty high body count in this book, but by the end each killing had been logically explained. Underhill has an interesting back story and I understood perfectly why his first murder was committed. I even agreed with him. Pellum is also an interesting, obsessed character and a good detective. I can see him continuing in other books if the author decides to make this into a series. I had never heard of this author before but, since I liked the writing style and the twisty plotting of this book, I will probably read more by him. I received a free copy of this book from the publisher."}, {"userName": "Allie Bock", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77159359-allie-bock", "userReview": "The Man with the Crooked Hat\u00a0sounded like an excellent read. It\u2019s about a detective trying to solve his wife\u2019s murder. He thinks it was done by a serial killer. The story follows him as he unravels the clues to confront the murderer. It is a psychological thriller, which is not my usual genre. In all reality, I was left disappointed at the ending.The writing was hard to get into. The author tended to write in short choppy sentences, and it felt disjointed to me.\u00a0\u00a0I had a hard time getting into the story. He wrote from both the detective\u2019s perspective and the murderer, which I don\u2019t really care for. So I knew who had killed the wife, it was just a matter of figuring it out why she was killed. I just couldn\u2019t get into the characters.

This was a first read of this author for me, but it will certainly not be the last! Dolan's writing is clever, his plotting serpentine and his characters intriguing, making for an addictive read.Jack Pellum is a former police detective. When his wife is murdered, Jack goes off the rails. The case remains unsolved after two years, but there is a clue that Jack is sure will lead him to the killer. The man wears a crooked hat. A recent murder finally lends credence to Jack's belief. The man with the hat is also sighted at this latest scene..... Jack is a great character, well fleshed out in both personality and personally. I liked his voice. Dolan gives him snappy dialogue, but also an introspective internal look at grief, loss and love. Jack is juxtaposed with Michael Underhill. Yes, we know the name of the killer and he too has a voice. A frightening one, as he can justify everything he's doing and has done. \"This is as much on you as it is on me. I'm not going to feel bad about this.\" We get to see inside Underhill's personal life as well.The plotting of The Man in the Crooked Hat does not follow a straightforward path - instead it is, well, crooked. We know who the killer is - or do we? Dolan's plotting is delightfully complex, with minuscule clues that need to be connected.

The Man in the Crooked Hat was another well-written addition to his repertoire. An added bonus: the story should appeal to readers who are not strictly mystery fans, as there was more depth and heft to the story than say, a typical thriller or action-based mystery. Another reviewer included that the book was more 'literary' and I'd agree with that. The only reason I gave the book 3 instead of 4 stars is I'm not overly fond of books that go back and forth between different narratives and characters - although I can understand why the book was laid out in this fashion. I wouldn't let this stop anyone from reading this book however - and to try other books written by Mr. Dolan as well.I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review - thank you to the publisher and Goodreads for providing me with this opportunity."}, {"userName": "Gloria Feit", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6469333-gloria-feit", "userReview": "From the publisher: Jack Pellum is a Detroit detective who left the force after his wife was murdered in a random attack. But Jack never bought that theory, and the case was never solved. Eighteen months later, Jack is working as a part-time private investigator while continuing the hunt for an elusive person of interest in his wife\u2019s murder: a man in a fedora who Jack is convinced could break open the case. When a local writer\u2019s cryptic suicide note suggests the man in the fedora actually exists, Jack picks up the thread he\u2019s certain will lead him to his wife\u2019s killer. He never imagined it would also unravel twenty years of secrets and unsolved crimes or make him the target of a psychopath trying to erase his own past. In the early pages of the book, Jack meets Paul Rook, 26 years old, whose mother was killed nine years earlier, and who shares a similar obsession, trying to find a man in a fedora who he thinks killed his mother. When Jack asks him what he thinks the man\u2019s motives are, the reply he receives is \u201c\u2019He kills people. He doesn\u2019t have motives.\u2019 He tells Paul that he has been doing his own sleuthing, and that he\u2019s \u2018found sightings of him. Some of them go back years. The earliest one I\u2019ve found was twenty years ago. It happened about thirty miles from here, in a town called Belleville. I think the man in the hat got his start there\u2019 . . . Paul had told him about more than a dozen murders - - each one with a witness who claimed to have seen a man in a hat. The sightings took place at different times, sometimes on the day of the murder, sometimes in the days before. Never at the scene of the crime. \u201d Jack then is told about another boy who was killed, about a month later, in a town six or seven miles from the scene of that murder.Jack is relentless in his search, and at times I must admit it became a bit too much of a slog for this reader. But the tension and the suspense mount, and almost before one realizes it one is caught up in the investigation almost as much as its protagonist. In the very first pages of the book we meet Michael Underhill. It is over 70 pages later before we meet him again. But surprisingly, that doesn\u2019t lessen the suspense. Even when we learn \u201cwho,\u201d the \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhy\u201d are absorbing, and the resolution is very satisfying.

Jack leaves the police force and working as a private investigator peppers the streets with flyers of a crude drawing of a man in a crooked hat. As fate would have it, a suicide leads him to the first of a handful of unsolved murders. Was his wife's murder random as it appears these were? Or are they all connected to the man in the crooked hat, making Jack's search more than what many think is a desperate man's hopeless obsession. The story works its way backwards, alternating between Jack's investigation, the murders, and the killer's rationale, if you can call it that for the murders. As the storyline comes full circle and the pieces of the puzzle fall into place, the killer makes one final threat that aims too close to home.

My instinct says \"thriller\" following with \"never mind\". But fortunately, Man in the Crooked Hat has changed my mind, at least in the case of Dolan. Highly intricate. Lots of characters. But the pace is measured until the pace itself heightens the tension. Jack Pellum, the protagonist, former cop, with a murdered wife. A father that keeps trying to fix Jack's life and has the money and political connections to do just that. The murderer at work in the first chapter, by name. As the characters move in and out of focus, they do so with the slightest tinge of unreliability. Or with a genuine ability to love. Or not, when love is expected.Well done.

That\u2019s a good thing, in my mind, in that it gives the book a literary depth well beyond the typical mystery or serial PI series. That depth, however, does slow the pace a bit. That\u2019s not a criticism in any way; just a warning, depending on what you\u2019re looking for. It reads like a novel.The best PI\u2019s in literature are always brooding, brilliant, and a bit lost. They\u2019re the big-hearted under-achievers that are always on the outside looking in on a normal life but the man or woman you want to have your back or be your friend. Jack Pellum, the protagonist here, is just such a man.A former detective, Pellum\u2019s wife is murdered and the police are without a suspect. Pellum, of course, carries the burden of finding her killer to the point of obsession. He ultimately uncovers the truth, but it is a complex and serpentine path of criminality that makes \u201cthe butler did it\u201d look childish in its simplicity by comparison. Jack is the son of a very well connected federal judge who is over-bearing and meddling, but that tension never gets fully developed. That doesn\u2019t detract from the story but I was left with some anticipation that never quite got fully satisfied. Perhaps in a future work.The book itself is not set in New York, Palm Beach, or Los Angeles, which in and of itself sets it apart. The plot unfolds in Detroit, a city of rich contrasts. Once a bustling metropolis that boasted an architecture and cultural scene that rivaled cities many times its size due to the wealth created by the automobile, it is a city struggling, with some success, to reclaim its lost glory. It is both a bit magnificent and gritty at the same time.There are plenty of twists to the plot, mostly unforeseen, and none goes so far as to risk crossing the line that holds the suspended disbelief intact. The writing is excellent and the dialogue, in particular, is crisp and efficient, but remains human, as you would expect in a good literary novel. Dolan is a first-rate storyteller and a first-rate writer and the two qualities together make for an outstanding read. I have no doubt that this author will continue to build on his past success. It is richly deserved."}, {"userName": "Barb Lie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6827714-barb-lie", "userReview": "The Man in the Crooked Hat by Harry Dolan is a standalone murder mystery. Jack Pellum, an ex-cop, is our hero. Two years ago, Jack\u2019s wife was murdered, and he is obsessed with finding the murderer, which eventually cost him his job. Even his detective friends try to get him to move on. But Jack can\u2019t rest, and uses every moment to put up flyers about a man with a crooked hat, which was his only clue to the killer. The main difference in this murder mystery is that we know from almost the beginning, who the murderer is. Michael Underhill has finally found his life coming together. He was a beautiful girlfriend, who loves him, and makes him happy; this is the life he wants badly, and he will let nothing change that.After awhile, when Jack begins to weaken his resolve, he gets a message and meets someone else looking for the man with the crooked hat. This will bring Jack to a small town, which will lead to various clues of previous murders that maybe related, even as far back as twenty years. The mystery is chilling, as there are many twists that will reveal a cunning murderer, and several deaths that are remotely connected. Jack being an experienced former detective, as well as driven by his wife\u2019s death, is probably the only one who can possibly to tie the strange pieces together.What follows is an exciting story and at times early on, a bit confusing. It was also an amazing in depth mystery, that involves several crimes, with various people, deaths that occur over the years, and those that had no real relation to each other. Slowly, with a POV of mostly Jack, but some with Mike Underhill, we learn the consequences that lead to Jack\u2019s wife\u2019s death, as well as some other recent deaths. I do not want to give spoilers, and this is a difficult review that telling too much more would ruin it for you. The Man in the Crooked Hat was an excellent murder mystery that kept me turning the pages, especially in the last half, which started to make more sense with each revelation. If you enjoy murder mysteries, a flawed but great leading character, in depth storytelling, very good secondary characters, a conniving murderer, and many twists and turns along the way, I suggest you read Harry Dolan\u2019s The Man in the Crooked Hat.BarbThe Reading Cafe"}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3446463-kathy", "userReview": "4.5 stars.In Harry Dolan's The Man in the Crooked Hat, an ex-cop haunted by his wife's unsolved murder follows a string of seemingly disparate murders in hopes of unmasking a clever murderer.Jack Pellum refuses to stop looking for his beloved wife Olivia Makinnen's killer and he is hopeful a new lead will finally provide the answers he is searching for. He is certain someone he spotted near their apartment right before Olivia's death, a stranger wearing a hat, is the person who murdered his wife. When his ex-partner tells him about that Danny Cavanaugh, who recently committed suicide, left a cryptic message about a killer who wears a crooked hat, Jack immediately starts investigating the puzzling lead. A friend of the recently deceased, Paul Rook, is another link to a possible murder by the man in the hat. Even more promising, Paul has a file of unsolved murders that stretches back decades and provides Jack with a new place to begin his investigation:Danny's brother Alex's never solved homicide. Thus begins Jack's latest quest in his eighteen month hunt for Olivia's killer.Jack is tenacious and determined to find the person responsible for murdering his wife. He spends day after day putting up flyers in hopes that someone will recognize the man in the hat. Danny's suicide is the first concrete information that the man in the hat might just be real, but finding the connection between the dead man's message and his wife's killer might be impossible. That is until Paul shows up with a stack of unsolved murders that also mention the man in the hat. Jack knows tying these deaths together with take a herculean effort but he is definitely up to the challenge.While Jack has no idea who killed his wife, readers know from the very beginning that Michael Underhill is Olivia's murderer. What no one, including Jack, knows is why Michael killed her. As Jack begins untangling the very complicated threads that might tie Underhill to the other murders, readers are provided with intriguing peeks into the life Michael is building with Anna Haley. She has no idea what the man she loves has been up to nor does she have a clue how far he is willing to go to ensure her happiness. With Jack gaining traction in unraveling the complicated trail of unsolved murders, will he finally find justice for Olivia?The Man in the Crooked Hat is an extremely clever and well-executed mystery. In a refreshing change of pace from the typical tech-laden investigations, Jack mainly relies on good old fashioned detective work to unearth clues and follow the evidence he uncovers. With plenty of unexpected twists and turns, Harry Dolan brings this brilliant novel to an exciting conclusion that completely wraps up all of the story's various threads.

It is rare to have an author introduce such a complicated premise with a high body count, and yet make everything make sense. I loved the author' delivery style because he made Jack's story very personal; I felt very sympathetic towards Jack and I wanted him to get what he wanted. In the beginning, it really did feel like a wild goose chase because the initial clues seemed so insubstantial. And I think that was the point; every character in this novel points out how fixated Jack is on these clues and the author wants the reader to also see that crazy side. But as the story starts to come together, and the narrative and clues begin to make sense, the author starts to make you rethink. As I mentioned before, there is a high body count and that worried me in the beginning because I really didn't want the author to just throw out some weird tie-in or conclusion. But the author didn't do that. Instead, he broke apart the murders and made it all make sense. There was logic in this story, and it was something I was really happy to see because it honestly doesn't happen very often. I also liked all of the characters the author created; even the minor characters had enough development that the reader could form a connection or opinion\u00a0 about them, which was really nice. Overall, this was a very good mystery and I cannot wait to read more by this author!

Honestly, I still can't, so here goes.The creepy man in the hat is in the deep background of many murders and suicides through the years, so deep, that the cops usually aren't even told. A brother may have seen him the day before his sibling's bicycle accident that took his life, days before his wife's death, the main character, Jack Pellum, saw a man in a hat that caught his eye in the crowd and for some reason, his presence made Jack uneasy to the point that even two years after his wife's death, he still thinks that man has something to do with it. Jack's powerful dad financially supports his son and helps him when he gets into legal messes, but pities him for his loss and thinks he needs to move on, both from his loss and this obsession with this man in the hat. The Jack meets someone that has tied other deaths to the man in the hat tangentially so Jack goes in search for answers. Answers that others may not like and definitely cause upheaval in the lives of those that thought they had moved on from their own losses, some over twenty years ago.It's slightly creepy and sad and full of dead ends for Jack and scary and a million things at once while you're reading. I won't say if there is a man in the crooked hat or not but will leave you with this, whatever the cause, grief sucks, leaves a hole in the life of everyone it touches, and ultimately, those left must find a way to move forward and that way won't be the same way they'd planned."}, {"userName": "Jenna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60147587-jenna", "userReview": "4.5 starswhile waiting in line at the book shop, i perused their in-store magazine. this was listed under best new mysteries of 2017.

I was like, \"where is this going?\" then i read the last sentence of the first chapter and i was like \"whoa! where did that come from?\" By the 2nd page of the 2nd chapter I was now drawn into the story. And a pat on the back to myself, b/c i used a ton of self-control not to peek ahead to the ending. I was glad didn't b/c there were many surprises along the way that i would have missed. (nor did i see coming)It is a bit of a darker story so may not appeal to people who prefer a more lighter mystery/detective.But i highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get drawn into a enthralling can't put down mystery story. Even though the killer's name is revealed early on, it becomes engrossing to read about his background and also the parallel story of the p.i. on his trail trying to solve the mystery of who & why which is the main narrative of the story."}, {"userName": "J.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4688889-j", "userReview": "Two years have passed since Jack Pellum\u2019s wife, Olivia Makinnen, was murdered. He can\u2019t let it go, primarily because the case remains unsolved. Another reason is that, at that time, he was a detective in the Detroit Police Department. As a matter of policy, he could not be allowed to participate in the investigation. And there is where his life began to unravel. Now, he is off the police force, is estranged from his parents and has used up just about every favor his friends will give him. He spends his time passing out flyers bearing the indistinct likeness of a man wearing a crooked hat, a man he saw loitering near his apartment just before the murder. As his hopes, and that of his parents and friends, reach a new low a suicide reveals that someone else saw a man in a crooked hat just before another murder many years before and miles away. It is a lead that will put Jack on the track of a serial killer and endanger all around him.There are lots of words that describe an abruptly changing course: serpentine, convoluted, sinuous, circuitous, twisting, etc. All of them can, and many have been used by others, to describe the often-changing path of the story in \u201cThe Man In The Crooked Hat.\u201d The first of these abrupt changes in direction blindsides the reader. But that is just one of many reasons to read this story. The characters are vivid, their the dialog is realistic, the plot and pace lead irresistibly to the next page, and then just one more. Suffice it to say that Dolan has a gift that other writers probably envy. This novel was a joy to read, and I highly recommend it to one and all.G.P.

If he can solve one of these murders, he can solve them all, he hopes--but the motivations behind all the deaths he gathers are more complex than they seem. The second point of view is of Michael Underhill. It's clear from early on that he killed Jack's wife, but not why--in fact, it takes most of the story to unravel why he killed her, a chain of events that seems inevitable once explained. While Jack is focused on his past and his loss, Michael is focused on his dreams of the future--a new house, and new life with his girlfriend. He'll do terrible things to protect that dream. Only one of these men can have what they want, and their clash draws larger and larger as the story progresses.I'm not so fond of stories told by killers, but Michael, for all he is lacking human feeling, has a tolerable voice. And he offers hints at a bit by bit pace that keeps the story moving, as you try to puzzle out what happened--knowing who is just a small part of the story. The why is complex, and intriguing. And the end has a little hope in it, so it isn't all grimdark. A good read for fans of twisty murder mysteries."}], "description": "\"A new master mystery writer emerges.\"--Forbes MagazineOne cryptic clue leads a desperate man into a labyrinthine puzzle of murder in the electrifying new novel from national bestselling author Harry Dolan.There's a killer, and he wears a crooked hat.Private investigator Jack Pellum has spent two years searching for the man who he believes murdered his wife--a man he last saw wearing a peacoat and a fedora.
