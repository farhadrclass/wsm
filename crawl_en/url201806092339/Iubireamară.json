Though I wasn't as drawn in at first by the narratorial voice here as I was with that of \"Days\", I ended up feeling much the same about both. They are not novels I can say I've enjoyed as they are so unsettling, but each has gotten under my skin and stayed there. Here too are abandonment issues: an anxious child unreasonably (perhaps) fearing that the better parent will leave her; the bad parent feeling abandoned by those he'd terrorized, including the anxious adult the narrator Delia has become. An abusive, controlling husband and a obsessive lover (or is he?) are not the only ones Ferrante seems to indict. The \"casual\" misogyny is horrifying too: men who stare at, or even rub up against, girls and women on public transportation; men who follow teenagers on errands in their working-class neighborhoods, drawing close to the frightened girls to hiss obscenities, and laugh. Delia has heard these obscenities since she was a very young child and can no longer tolerate her local dialect, preferring to speak formal Italian instead, which in turn makes those in her hometown uncomfortable.Though I feel anxiety doing so (I think this is what is termed an addiction), I've just requested The Lost Daughter from the library ...*Miscellaneous:I'd thought I was reading Ferrante's novels in publication order, but I discovered that this (1991) actually came before \"Days\" (2002). I've noticed the same quirks in both books: instead of semi-colons, commas mostly are used to join complete thoughts; and the word \"definitively\" is used rather often.*Updated (Feb 11):I'd wondered if the first 'quirk' I noted above was due to the translator's trying to get a sense of the Italian into the translation. This is from the translator herself: '... what we would think of as a run-on. But of course Italian can do that, I mean, for one thing there are genders, so you can have an adjective not near its noun, because you know from the ending that it goes with that noun, but in English you can\u2019t do that. Things have to be closer together or connected by clauses, like, \u201cwho is,\u201d \u201cthat is,\u201d \u201cthat was,\u201d whatever.

Somewhere in this infusion of memory and psyche wrapped in a blanket of refined language, are hidden clues and a mystery to be solved. Somewhere in this mother-daughter relationship is a meshing of two generations of women and one quickly realizes that this is not only a story about the mother, that there are two stories occurring simultaneously. Memory is fragile, and oftentimes the past intertwines with the present and childhood recollections blends into a story told by an unreliable narrator. Sometimes it takes a visit from the past to bring forth truths and in this case, the story unravels as Delia seeks answers to a traumatic incident from her childhood, even if that incident is told in a fleeting paragraph that the reader must follow closely to uncover, even if that incident is hidden by the overriding story of a childhood with a father who was abusive to her mother. Things aren't always what they seem and as is her style, Ferrante elucidates a mood through stark imagery that at times is chilling. Yet unlike the structured messiness of The Days of Abandonment, the story arc here is a bit muddled, the inner workings of this narrator somewhat littered; however, if you want the brutal delivery of desire and emotion, this is it."}, {"userName": "Fiona MacDonald", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2417021-fiona-macdonald", "userReview": "Elena Ferrante has such a beautiful and lyrical way of writing.

Even from her very first published novel, Ferrante seems to be so sure of what she has to say\u2014or at least confident in approaching touchy subjects and asking big questions. This book hits on a lot of major themes that resurface in Ferrante's later works: mother/daughter relationships, the male gaze, female bodies, identity crises, etc. And while it was a bit rough around the edges, literally and figuratively (Ferrante doesn't avoid 'crude' topics), Troubling Love\u2014in Italian, L'amore Molesto, a very apt title\u2014is thought-provoking, intense and riveting. Perhaps it is easier to appreciate after having read later works by the author, but nonetheless it's an impressive debut and Goldstein's translation is flawless."}, {"userName": "Rae Meadows", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3184-rae-meadows", "userReview": "Readers of Ferrante's other books will recognize familiar themes in her first novel--estranged yet intense mother/daughter relationship, violence in the home, violence in Naples, poverty, lascivious and aggressive men, disassociation from self, the body, the body, the body, particularly a woman's body. This book definitely suffered for me having read all her other work and seeing the themes better developed in later work. Delia's mother has drowned in an apparent suicide, and Delia goes back to Naples in search of her mother's essence, the mystery that surrounds her final days, her later life that may or may not have been spent with a (lewd) man from the old neighborhood who courted her forty years before. As in The Days of Abandonment, Delia is coming undone, so the reader never quite knows what is her warped perception and what is actually the case. Men are violent, abusive, disgusting, and sexual predators who spew crude filth in dialect, but Delia is no victim. (After a sexual encounter with a man she'd known as a child: \"But at the same time I was grateful for the small dose of humiliation and pain he had inflicted on me.\")Ferrante is never far from the \"uneasiness of bodies\" in this book (and in all her work). A memory Delia has of her father and mother:\"Once he was certain that a man in the crowd had touched her. In front of everyone he slapped her: in front of us. I was painfully astonished. I was sure that he would kill the man, and I didn't understand why, instead, he hit her. Even now I didn't know why he had done it. Maybe to punish her for having felt in the fabric of her dress, on her skin, the warmth of that other body.\"\"Our father did not appear to us at all exceptional, slovenly as he was, fat, bald, unwashed, his sagging pants smeared with paint.\"On poverty and her mother:\"Once, the sewing-machine needle pierced the nail of her index finger, came out the other side, went up and in again, three or four more times. Well, she stopped the pedal, then started it up, but just enough so she could get the needle out, bandaged the finger, and went back to work.\"I'm tempted to bump the review up to four stars because of Ferrante's singularity alone, but I can't say I loved reading this book.

It took me a week, partly because of content.Good: the prose, even translated, is a relief from the easy patterns encountered in so much genre storytelling, but at least genre books, even with pedestrian prose, don't leave me feeling degraded and weary.Dispiriting, degrading, wearying, dreary, and sordid, about sum up the reading experience here.

The drowning death of her sixty-three year old mother, Amalia, sends Rome cartoonist, Delia back to her hometown of Naples for the funeral. The circumstances of Amalia\u2019s death were a little strange: overdue for her monthly visit to Delia, she was found on the beach that was their childhood holiday destination, dressed only in an expensive bra. Suicide is assumed. Back in the town she fled years ago, the surroundings, events and people she encounters force Delia to re-examine her childhood and adolescence, and reassess her memories of that time. Ferrante is described as one of the great novelists of our time, and she certainly has a talent for rendering powerful images and ideas (\u201cAmalia had the unpredictability of a splinter, I couldn\u2019t impose on her the prison of a single adjective\u201d), but one does not read this author for pleasure. In this, her first novel under this pseudonym, her characters are wholly unappealing: a flirtatious mother who takes her young daughter along to her assignations; a violent, jealous and insecure husband and father; an arrogant lover; an old man with a soiled underwear fetish. Their dialogue is occasionally difficult to follow, the intended meaning and significance of their words obscure. Ferrante sets her story in a male-dominated culture, where sexual harassment is commonplace, verbal abuse is the norm (\u201cIn fact, they had produced in unison a tumult of insults in dialect, a long list of words ending in consonants, as if the final vowel had been thrown into an abyss and the rest of the word were whining mutely in displeasure\u201d), and domestic violence is routine.Readers may well wonder just how reliable Delia is as a narrator: Was she really molested at age five by the grandfather of her playmate? Was Amalia really an adultress? Delia is difficult to identify with: she provides bizarre intimate details of her life, and the reasons for some of her actions, incomprehensible: \u201c\u2026I was grateful for the small dose of humiliation and pain he had inflicted on me\u201d. Sometimes her thoughts are quite convoluted: \u201cMaybe I couldn\u2019t tolerate that the most secret part of myself used that solidarity to give weight to a hypothesis cultivated with equal secrecy: that my mother bore inscribed in her body a natural guilt, independent of her will and of what she really did, and yet readily appearing as needed in every gesture, in every breath\u201d.

A Lot.\"Not sure how a 139 page book can seem so long and unnecessarily convoluted, but this one managed. It is the story of Delia, daughter of Amalia. Amalia drowns in the sea wearing only a beautiful lace bra, an item of clothing she would never wear. Sounds good so far, right?And that's where the good part ends. The rest of the book is a mish mash of Delia trying to determine what has happened to her mother and flashbacks to a past riddled with domestic violence and other abuse.I love a good dark story, but this book was just not good.- First, it is laden down with description. I love beautiful prose, and maybe this prose is beautiful in Italian. In English, the amount of description just overwhelmed the story. Honestly, I didn't find it was helping me visualize the scenes well, and isn't that the whole point? Some of it was well done, but it was just too copious! The book felt like all it did was tell me things . . .it is all narrated and nothing comes alive. With the exception of one sex scene between Delia and a former childhood friend that is just kinda gross.- Second, I didn't give a rip about any of the characters . . .I chalk that up to poor character development, and for me, if you don't get that right, the book generally is a failure.- Finally, and worst of all, it is difficult to tease out what is memory, what is fantasy, and what is reality in this book. I guess that's the point, but I never felt as certain as I wanted to be about what was going on.It is as though the writing was designed to obfuscate. And I can see why because the ending is truly not satisfying. This book is not written as a mystery where suspense and tension build and the end culminates in satisfying way. It's more of a psychological study of a mother/daughter relationship, but not in a way that you care about either the mother or the daughter.This book had echoes of Atonement from a plot standpoint except Atonement was done about 20x better. And some would argue that Atonement isn't that great either. Stylistically, this book was far inferior to me, but it had a similar plot driver and also kept the reader at arms length.I gave the book two stars because I think the idea of it had potential and because some of the description was very good even if there was way too much of it and much of it bored me.

Either way, Delia is haunted by the mysterious events of Amalia's final days, and soon enough, we are too.Delia's narration is not unreliable, it's prismatic and refractive. We meet a mysterious man named Caserta only to find out that Caserta's name is not Caserta. One character turns from no-nonsense professional to pitiable son to pervert to innocent to pervert to cipher before fading into the diaphanous piecework that is as close as Delia will get about the truth that happened to her mother, which is the same thing as the truth that happened to them all.As much as our perceptions of events and characters continually change throughout the book, looking back once one has finished, one can't say that Delia is ever misleading.

The story has remained entangled in certain spaces of the city, in the dialectical voices through which it took shape. The woman comes into the labyrinth of Naples to capture it, put it in order, arrange space and time, finally tell her own story out loud. She tries and in doing so understands that, if she succeeds, she will also succeed in finally adding to herself her mother, her mother's world, her wrongs, struggles, passions consummated or imagined, inhabited energies and those which expanded within the few accessible channels. That's all. Even the mystery of her Amalia's death slowly becomes irrelevant for Delia; or rather it becomes a minor part of her and her mother's story.Elena Ferrante on Troubling Love in an unsent letter to the critic Goffredo Fofi, 1995, eventually published in La frantumaglia.L'amore molesto was the debut novel of Elena Ferrante, published in 1992, but only translated into English, as Troubling Love, in 2006, after the translation of her second, novel I giorni dell'abbandono (Italian 2002, English: The Days of Abandonment 2005).The story starts with Delia returning from Rome to her home town of Naples after the death by drowning, likely suicidal, of her mother Amalia, who is the days preceding her death had made several odd phone calls to Delia. The body was found wearing only an upmarket bra of a type Amalia would not have owned, let alone worn. I saw the body and, faced with that livid object, felt that I had better grab onto it in order not to end up in some unknown place. It hadn\u2019t been assaulted. It showed only some bruises, a result of the waves that, though gentle, had pushed her all night against some rocks at the edge of the water. It seemed to me that around the eyes she had traces of heavy makeup. I observed her for a long time, uneasily, her legs, olive-skinned and extraordinarily youthful for a woman of sixty-three. With the same uneasiness I realized that the bra was very different from the shabby ones she usually wore. The cups were made of finely worked lace and revealed the nipples. They were joined by three embroidered \u201cV\u201ds, the signature of a Neapolitan shop that sold expensive lingerie for women, that of the Vossi sisters. When it was given to me, along with her earrings and her rings, I sniffed it for a long time. It had the sharp odor of new fabric.Searching for the truth behind her mother's death, Delia is sucked back into a world she had left years before, of searing heat, squalid surroundings, lascivious menfolk and Neapolitan dialect, all described by Ferrante, via Delia, in unsparingly visceral prose. Delia slowly tries to untangle a complex story involving her uncle, her father, who separated from her mother over 20 years earlier but still remains violently jealous of her, a third man, Caserta, a former business partner of her father until he was accused of an affair with her mother, and who now, decades later, appeared to be re-wooing Amalia, and Antonio, Caserta's son and Delia's childhood friend.The set up suggests a form of mystery but that isn't Ferrante's intention at all. As her own take on the novel suggests, exactly what happened becomes increasingly unimportant (and is never truly resolved, although there is one related revelation as to a key lie told by Delia as a young child which poisoned the relationship between the other characters ever since). Rather, Delia's journey enables her to better understand her mother's life and her own and indeed how they are interlinked. Delia's father is a for-hire low-budget portrait painter, and one crucial moment in his relationship with his wife and his business partner came when he switched to painting variations on just one picture, a nude gypsy whose body was modelled on his wife (the face was left to be filled in to the purchaser's taste):I didn't understand and perhaps there was nothing to understand. How was it possible that my father could hand over, to vulgar men, bold and seductive versions of that body which if necessary he would defend with a murderous rage? How could he place it in lewd poses when for an immodest smile or look he became a wild beast, without pity. Why did he abandon it on the streets and in the houses of strangers, by the tens and hundreds of copies, when he was so jealous of the original?The various characters are rather overwrought, with characters abusing each other in Neapolitan dialect at whim, for example when Delia first meets Caserta, who she doesn't recognise:I was hit by a stream of obscenities in dialect, a soft river of sound that involved me, my sisters, my mother in a concoction of semen, saliva, feces, urine, in every possible orifice.The Iowa Review points out that the original Italian word translated as concoction is frullato, which would be used for a milkshake or smoothie, an even more deliberately repulsive image.Dialect is key to the novel, but generally this is actually not something lost in translation, as even in the Italian original, Ferrante does not use the dialect on the page: The sound of obscenities uttered in dialect - the only obscenities that could fit together sound and sense in my head in such a way as to make concrete a sex that was troublesome in its aggressive, pleasure-seeking and sticky realism: every other formula outside of that dialect seemed to me insignificant, often light-hearted, pronounceable without repulsion - softened in an unexpected way, becoming a kind of rustling against the roller of an old typewriter.We see a taste of the two very different worlds of women in Naples, the traditional and that of the newly rich: the Vossi sisters shop is now run by new management and caters for a very different clientele to that Delia remembers from her youth (there is a clear echo of the world to which Lila is originally drawn in My Beautiful Friend):It wasn't the clientele I had imagined. They seemed women whose men had got rich suddenly and easily, hurling them into a provisional luxury that they were compelled to enjoy, and whose subculture was like a damp crowded basement, with semi-porn comic strips, with obscenities used as refrains. They were women forced into a city-prison, corrupted first by poverty and now by money, with no interruption. I realised I was getting nervous. They behaved with that man the way my father imagined women behaved, the way he imagined his wife behaved as soon as he turned his back, the way Amelia too, perhaps, had fore her whole life dreamed of behaving: a woman of the world who bends over without having to place two fingers at the centre of her neckline, crosses her legs without worrying about her skirt, laughs coarsely, covers herself with costly objects, her whole body brimming with indiscriminate sexual offerings, ready to joust face to face with men in the area of the obscene.At times the sentences, at least in the English translation (and I suspect from other Ferrante novels, the original) get a little lost in their own complexity. The sort of prose that have led some to dislike Ferrante's work. E.g. talking of her Uncle, her mother's brother, who nevertheless sided with Delia's father after he separated from his wife, Delia comments:Maybe I couldn't tolerate that the most secret part of myself used that solidarity to give weight to an hypothesis cultivated with equal secrecy: that my mother bore inscribed in her body a natural guilt, independent of her will and of what she really did, and yet readily appearing as needed in every gesture, on every breath.Overall, one can see why the novel made such a stir when published and launched Ferrante's reputation, particularly in the way it tackles female sexuality and male chauvinism in such a excruciating way. But, and unlike The Days of Abandonment and The Lost Daughter, it comes across as more of a prototype for her later works and less a fully accomplished novel in its own right. So recommended to those who have read her other novels, but I would not start here.The novel concludes:Amalia had been. I was Amalia."}, {"userName": "Kornet", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38869747-kornet", "userReview": "Jag \u00e4lskar elena ferrante s\u00e5\u00e5\u00e5\u00e5 mkt!!!

Although there are many unanswered questions in the end, I guess the ambiguity is part of the package as those are not what the author wanted to leave to her readers. The truth about the death of the mother is simply left open for interpretation just like how the relationship of the mother to her daughter is in the first place: cold, indifferent and distant. Just like many other situations I encountered from reading fiction, reading this book is like threading in an uncharted territory as all of the mother-daughter relationships that I've seen in my 50 years on earth are full of love, warmth and respect.The story revolves around Dalia the daughter of a woman who has just committed suicide on the beach in Naples, Italy where they used to go on outing when Dana is still a child. Dalia has gone to attend the funeral so she has to travel from Bologna. In her return to Naples, the memories of her childhood come back that helps her to remember the pivotal events in her life, most of them sad and painful, including the rocky marriage of her parents that affected her psychological make up especially on how she deals with men. What makes this book every interesting to read is the prose. It is direct, blunt, almost ascerbic and in total contrast to the mushy title. When I ordered this from Amazon a couple of years back, I had this, along with a number of other books, delivered to my mother's seniors' apartment in National City, CA and I even suggested that maybe she should read this first. Good that she did not because this is about difficulty and harshness of married life and the sometimes strange ways mothers and daughters relate to each other. In short, this having this title, the chicklity cover and being written by a woman looked like a melodramatic novel for me.It is not. There is even a rumor that the reclusive Elena Ferrante is actually a man and I now know where is that rumor coming from. It's in her prose."}, {"userName": "Marcello S", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38785158-marcello-s", "userReview": "L\u2019Incipit finisce dritto nella categoria \u201cse lo inizi in libreria difficile che non te lo porti a casa\u201d.

I admired the writing (or the translation, rather) but didn't feel like I ever got engaged with either the characters or the subject matter. The book opens with the suicide of the narrator's mother and goes down from there. I think the title is apt -- all the love described in this slim volume is troubling in nature, love being loosely defined. Perhaps it just struck me as too dark and unhappy for the mood I brought to it but I had trouble following along at times and also found myself distracted and bored. If it was supposed to be suspenseful, I never cared enough to go along for the ride. Yet, I'd give her another try -- there are moments that are startling and brave and make you want to see how she might develop as a writer (this was her first novel).

As she narrates, however, there are hints of all sad possibilities. She had a father whom she hated and who hated her; he who may have loved her mother too much; a mother who had loved them all but who may have had another lover apart from her husband; a childhood sin which made a martyr out of her own mother; memories of events that explain everything and nothing. The prose blows into your face like a harsh, dry, merciless desert wind. What was she feeling towards the end? Guilt? Remorse? Fear? Loneliness? She saw her mother in herself.

Acho que s\u00f3 agora consegui entender boa parte da estranheza que ela prop\u00f5e e como \u00e9 dif\u00edcil montar o quebra-cabe\u00e7a criado pelo enredo. E \u00e9 um livro \u00f3timo para discutir, ali\u00e1s, \u00e9 bonito como os livros de Ferrante provocam esse sentimento para fora, como se fizesse parte da experi\u00eancia de leitura falar \u00e0 exaust\u00e3o a respeito deles. F-errante, parece que o movimento dos livros dela \u00e9 o (de) vagar.A rela\u00e7\u00e3o m\u00e3e-filha \u00e9 o assunto principal de Um amor inc\u00f4modo e \u00e9 o livro em que ele \u00e9 mais explorado. Penso muito no que Contardo Calligaris diz sobre isso: nem toda rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre m\u00e3e e filha \u00e9 horr\u00edvel, mas as que s\u00e3o, s\u00e3o muito horrorosas. Entre Delia e Amalia \u00e9 horrorosa porque n\u00e3o houve uma separa\u00e7\u00e3o. A grande quest\u00e3o em jogo, a meu ver, \u00e9 a simbiose entre os corpos das duas. Delia n\u00e3o sabe o que \u00e9 ser uma mulher separada do corpo da m\u00e3e, tanto que as identidades das duas se confundem quando a m\u00e3e morre. Sabe-se pouco sobre quem \u00e9 Delia antes dessa morte, basicamente s\u00f3 que ela seguiu uma profiss\u00e3o relacionada a quadrinhos. O processo de luto vai envolver lidar com a perda mas principalmente saber o que fica nela que foi da m\u00e3e. Ao mesmo tempo, Delia n\u00e3o sabe quem foi Amalia. Esse duplo aparece o tempo todo no enredo e fica muito claro quando se fala nas roupas. Delia convive com a culpa por ter fantasiado que entregou a m\u00e3e \u00e0 viol\u00eancia do pai quando era crian\u00e7a e isso a impediu de saber um pouco mais sobre Amalia. O tom de suspense que o livro adquire \u00e9 mais pela tentativa de Delia agora explorar quem era a m\u00e3e do que a descoberta dos acontecimentos em si. Mas, a\u00ed vem novamente a dicotomia, ela sabe, desde a sa\u00edda, que \u00e9 imposs\u00edvel saber quem era a m\u00e3e porque suas mem\u00f3rias de inf\u00e2ncia s\u00e3o trai\u00e7oeiras.A forma como Ferrante vai construir sua obra j\u00e1 se encontra presente em Um amor inc\u00f4modo e \u00e9 impressionante como esses temas sempre surgem de forma circular mas nunca repetitiva. Algo que \u00e9 pr\u00f3prio desse livro \u00e9 a forma on\u00edrica como ele \u00e9 contado. Eu sou uma pessoa normalmente distra\u00edda e muitas vezes me perdia durante a leitura porque \u00e9 como se Delia realmente estivesse em um movimento de ser levada pelos acontecimentos e as \u00fanicas formas de autonomia que visualizamos \u00e9 em rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0s suas mem\u00f3rias. S\u00f3 que elas n\u00e3o d\u00e3o nem sinal de quando v\u00e3o aparecer e a releitura foi muito proveitosa nesse sentido, perceber como um fato do presente levava a outro do passado que sempre tinha a ver com viol\u00eancia. E \u00e9 evidente que Ferrante estava muito influenciada pela teoria da sedu\u00e7\u00e3o e o conceito de fantasia em Freud.

The writing is far too involved with itself, to the point of reading sentences that are too caught up in their own ornamentation that they are confusing. One sentence I underlined mentions a father who belongs to a generation that could not imagine waste. Now, interpretively, this passage can go two ways: (1) the father is so repulsed by the concept of wasting materials that he saves everything; or (2) the concept of things \"going to waste\" is something he is so blind to, or so oblivious of, that he is extraordinarily wasteful. These types of sentences abound in Troubling Love, where the furious neuroses Ferrante has for the prose to be crafted causes a distraction from some of the fundamentals, namely, clarity.Troubling Love gets flak for its purposeful ambiguity but I actually found the mysteries to be revealed well, and clearly (at least when it counted), but the pacing at which they occur is stilted. Ferrante's momentum oscillates rapidly between some haunting set-pieces and some eye-rolling attempts at aiming for the rafters through some tried-and-true psychological horror (yawn, another appearance of someone who died, yawn, sudden appearance of face in mirror). Forward acceleration becomes marred with the novice writer's preoccupation with rhapsodic descriptive writing. Action is suspended for preoccupied treatises on sugared almonds, as if the new writer needed to take time to prove every muscle that can be flexed. The metaphor of fabric here is very apt, often beautiful, but comes at the cost of being somewhat tortured by the narrative's end. Ultimately, it is an unusual book that became a movie, and, as you visualize the text, one realizes how it could be made into an Insomnia-style piece. Ho hum. It's fun to read it as \"the book Elena Greco first wrote\" in the Neapolitan books, but I cannot recommend it on its own, and the Neapolitan novels are still an absolute treasure without needing to arrive at this place. Good enough for completionists like me, though."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2744544-robert", "userReview": "Call me biased but when an Italian author shows up on this list I always break into a smile. Usually I can relate to these books more as Malta is very similar in both environment and people and the translations are very good as Italian is a relatively easy language to convert into English. However I am going to say that I have some mixed feelings about Troubling Love.Delia discovers that her mother, Amalia, has committed suicide by drowning and further inspection finds out that the only thing she was wearing was a very fancy bra. Delia is puzzled on why her mother would do such a thing and decides to return to Naples and uncover the secrets of her mother\u2019s past.In the process Delia begins to discover that her mother did actually have a secret life and she wonders if it has anything to do with the past so Delia reminisces about childhood events and friends. Eventually she remembers why her parents split, Amalia\u2019s close friendship with her father\u2019s business partner and ultimately her own relationship with Amalia. All which lead to a startling discovery about herself.On the whole the Troubling Love is a deeply psychological novel and also a sensuous one and there were a great many passages which I loved reading but I felt that it didn\u2019t hold together as well as it should , something was lacking.

I'm going to classify it with the works that dig deep into the dark side of men and women. The story is about the struggle of Delia, a middle aged woman, with the death of her mother, Amalia. Delia has fled her home town Naples in an attempt to break radically with her mother and (the separate living) father. But after the death (suicide?) of Amalia Delia tries to unravel the mystery around the life her mother has led. She finds no really satisfying answers, but instead is confronted with a lot of troubling experiences out of her own past. The quest Ferrante describes not only presents a staggering image of the seamy side of Naples, but above all it illustrates the devastating effect of morbid jealousy, of the inability to really communicate, and of the inability to come clean with the past. The Italian Ferrante uses is a bit above my capabilities, but the very cinematic atmosphere makes the story rather easy to follow.
