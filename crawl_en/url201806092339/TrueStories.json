En nydelig diktsamling der ca halvparten er et antall ekstraordin\u00e6rt f\u00f8lelsesrike kj\u00e6rlighetsdikt (som oppleves s\u00e6rdeles selvbiografiske, men kanskje ikke er det?) og hvor resten av diktene sentrerer seg rundt menneskets up\u00e5litelige oppfattelse av seg selv og verden rundt. Ikke minst \"sannhetene\" vi forteller oss selv for p\u00e5 en m\u00e5te \u00e5 gi oss selv en f\u00f8lelse av identitet p\u00e5 v\u00e5r sv\u00e6re klode. Anbefales s\u00e5 absolutt. Favorittdelen - om jeg kan kalle det det - var definitivt kj\u00e6rlighetsdiktene."}, {"userName": "Mark Valentine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51505757-mark-valentine", "userReview": "I read this book a couple of decades ago and had forgotten so. When I picked it up today, knowing that I liked her poetry, I was enthused and excited to re-discover my favorite poem, \"Variations on the Word Sleep.\" The final stanza resonates within me: \"I would like to be the air/that inhabits you for a moment/only. I would like to be that unnoticed/& that necessary.\" To me, this shows the elegance and simplicity of genuine love."}, {"userName": "laRose", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9084110-larose", "userReview": "margaret atwood's approach to language is intelligent & precise. so her poems appear neat & perhaps plain, but are cutting! this 'plainness' i think acts an anesthetic, so you might not realize at first just how sharp her poems are, or how deeply they have cut you until you look down & see all this blood.i enjoyed this very much"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38396393-laura", "userReview": "I like this author more and more as I read more of her work beyond her novels. This is poetry how I like it with visceral, descriptions that are so precise yet leave space for you to find yourself in them."}, {"userName": "Sarah Ansani", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7295207-sarah-ansani", "userReview": "I loved this book, from its beginning where touch and color are questioned through shape and light to its end where death is in the height of spring, among the chicken eggs. It is a book of the author's truths; reminders that the world is just the world and it's not there to be poeticized. \"...the sea is as blue/every morning as it always/was.\" Atwood searches for sincerity in all things. The landcrab's persistence and ignorance of its own beauty as it makes a beautiful life out of cold hardness. Atwood speaks to \"you\" which often seems like a child or lover that the desperate narrator keeps trying to will into existence. And that fight between that desired non-existing and the unquestionable facts of life: \"There's a cooked bird, a sharp knife:/that's real/and to be dealt with,\" she says to \"you\" who are not there with her. Who she desires. \"Is this really your fate,/to enter poetry and become transparent?\" And how saddened I was by this line where she chooses to accept the truth of that desired non-existing thing: \"Let's believe/you know your way\". And, \"...the only way is through.\""}, {"userName": "Alexa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6260491-alexa", "userReview": "A beautiful collection of poetry, spanning love, politics, and death, in a way that spoke to me much more than her previous poetry has. This feels to me like a more mature Margaret Atwood, one who writes of the vagaries of love within a committed relationship rather than the agony of young and uncertain love, one who isn\u2019t afraid to let her political opinions show, and one who is living through the death of earlier generations. This is very, very rich in a beautiful way! This is worth returning to again and again."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1933175-helen", "userReview": "Good stuff when she writes about solid things like the sea and crabs and seagulls. The oft quoted line \"a word after a word after a word is power\" comes from a poem in this collection. But the words poem and poetry are overused in these poems and poetry. Ars poetica works best when it's subtle, unwordy. Her fiction is better than her poetry. But both have merit."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3502519-julie", "userReview": "I wasn't a huge fan of the love poems, but it's rare for me to like those no matter how well-written, and all of these are wonderfully arranged and evocative. The center of the book was my favorite, and it made me sad that those same horrors continue around the world. She expresses the exact frustration and despair we feel at the hopelessness of making a difference."}, {"userName": "Johanna Haas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22180864-johanna-haas", "userReview": "The first third are personal messages to people I don't know - perhaps her husband, daughter, mother, or friend.
