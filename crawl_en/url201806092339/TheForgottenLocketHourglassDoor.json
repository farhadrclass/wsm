Like, \"There is this huuuuge problem! The world is going to end. How about I pull an illogical answer out of thin air and try it? Oh, wow! It worked! Because I'm SPECIAL!\" Lather, rinse, repeat. And seriously, this is the end of the book: \"I made a wish, and I knew in my core it would come true. So I wished that all of our problems would disappear and everything would be perfect. And of course it worked, the end.\" If I had to map this plot out on one of those plot graphs they had us do in Jr High, my head would explode. There is no rising and falling action, it seriously ALL CONFLICT. My biggest beef is that this book didn't need to be written... there was so much filler (that added nothing, in my opinion) to get to the resolution, I kept asking myself why it couldn't have all been done in one book. It seems like it was a trilogy for trilogy's sake, more to make extra money than anything else. And there are way too many adjectives in this series. It didn't bug me so much in the first book, but by the third, I was wishing I had an editor's pen in my hand."}, {"userName": "Kari", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6135943-kari", "userReview": "I'm so relieved this series is over! I pushed through this last one and was just saddened by so much wasted potential. The author really has a way of illustration so you feel like you are there and you can vividly see the imagery in your head. Her writing can be beautiful. Also her particular concept of a river of time and traveling to the bank of the river was new and original to me. I felt she really could go far.However, I was left frustrated by too many connections she made without explanations - like you were supposed to just accept it without wondering how or why, even if it didn't make sense at all. And I kept thinking move on move on, lets get back to the point, while I was reading. There was too much drama going on to make it exciting rather than wrapping it all together. I found myself often forgetting what Abby and Dante were even supposed to be doing because so much was unexplained that I was confused as to why what was happening was even important. I felt that if Mangum would have kept the reader more aligned with the main plot-line and explained the connections better, rather than presenting the same imagery of the river over and over - no matter how beautiful, I would have enjoyed it more. As it is now, I just lost focus and interest.I will say the ending was better than I thought it would be, but I still just felt a monumental relief that I made it through."}, {"userName": "Erica (daydreamer)", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2835464-erica-daydreamer", "userReview": "The Forgotten Locket is an incredible, beautiful ending to the Hourglass Door Trilogy. With the ending of The Golden Spiral, I was more than anxious to read the sequel, to see what would happen, and finally have everything come together. Lisa Mangum created an intricate, timeless tale with her story of Dante and Abby. It flows with the breath of time, circling into my mind, taking root, becoming one with me. She created the possible out of the impossible, by using the echoes of time, the chime of the past and future, Mangum crafted a story that is at once confusing, as it is readily believable. With this conclusion of Abby and Dante\u2019s story, their lives come full circle, ending where it began, with a promise of a bright future, with their past behind them, but still a part of them. In the beginning of this novel, they travel through time to Dante\u2019s past, and there begins the end, where they fix what has been unraveled, save what has been lost, and ultimately, binding their hearts together in an unbreakable bond. The entire concept of this trilogy, of time travel is so intriguing, and it boggles my mind. But as I felt before when I first read The Hourglass Door, Mangum makes it so easy to believe, and I was left with no confusion or doubts. It\u2019s incredible really, how she does it, and how she ties everything together, taking the reader into the future by going to the past, watching things unfold that will lead to the future events in The Hourglass Door and so on.When I read her books, I can feel time like Abby does, the flow of it, the in between of the words and moments, can feel their lives intertwining and mixing with time. The rhythmic cadence flows smoothly through Mangums writing as she weaves her tale of darkness and light with characters that just breathe life onto the pages. Each character was built with such finesse, given the time to ease into their true roles that Mangum envisioned. Orlando may be my favorite character. I love his strength and love, I love how Mangum created his story and background that shows us the man he will become in The Hourglass Door, and I loved how the Lady of the Light came to be. It was actually surprising what he felt towards her, but it makes sense that he would. And this created that timeless bond that formed between them, that let them trust each other completely and to honor their vows. And Abby and Dante\u2019s love is beautiful, everlasting, shining though and beyond time where it will never end. True love, that made their whole journey and triumph possible. The cover of the oval locket doesn\u2019t make sense until the end, and after understanding what it was and what it meant, the story became that much more meaningful to me, putting that last perfect touch to the start of Abby and Dante\u2019s life together. I am blissfully satisfied with the way this story ended. And while their story for us may be over, it will still live inside me showing what love is and what it can accomplish, and how time surrounds us, breathing music and possibilities into us, daring us to seize the time we do have, and make the most of it with what we can."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/738409-sarah", "userReview": "This isn't really a review because I just don't have the energy to think about and articulate everything that was wrong with this book.

She and Dante continue to try and save the river of time, which Zo has changed and broken. If they are not successful time will break completely.[return][return]This book just didn\u2019t do it for me. I just wasn\u2019t able to get a cohesive sense of how the story connected. It didn\u2019t seem that there was a strong plot arc, where every piece would eventually connect to form the story. It was more like interludes of running away from Zo and then chasing Zo and then something bad would happen and they would have to try and recover from that as well and then hope for the best. Then some how it was all supposed to work and make sense. Well, it didn\u2019t work for me. [return][return]Another irritation; I don\u2019t really like when a character doesn\u2019t understand their powers and continues to make last ditch efforts to save things and they work simply because good must triumph over bad and the main characters must win. It felt like this story had a lot of that. The chemistry between Abby and Dante was flat, mostly relying on their past history together. Overall I was disappointed by this series."}, {"userName": "Carie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2187401-carie", "userReview": "3.5 for this one. It\u2019s better than the second book, but not as good as the first. I guess it\u2019s a satisfying ending for the series, but I was bothered by a lot here. First, there were lots of convenient bending/breaking of rules with the river/bank that confused me. Also, way too much garbage with Zo and not enough interaction with the past IMO. And, there seemed to be some weird inconsistencies in this series--with weird resolutions (or non-resolutions) in this book (e.g. the Sofia thing was oddly resolved (see SPOILERS section below)). I did enjoy the interaction with Dante\u2019s family and there were some incredibly tense \u201chow will they get out of this?\u201d moments. I have always liked the characters--especially Abby, Dante, and Leo, so it was good to have resolution for them. Overall, I\u2019m glad this series is finished and I was generally happy with the ending and some aspects of this book, but I thought the first book had such great potential and I ended up feeling like that potential never came close to what it could have been--which was really disappointing\u2026 **SPOILERS**: Something that REALLY bothered me: I thought there should have been more coordination with Abby and Dante\u2019s wishes/decisions at the end because they came across as seeming kind of selfish to me--like they both chose to possibly ditch the other person to an eternity of loneliness so they could personally be healed (since neither knew the other had made that wish/decision when they did). Yay for true love!! I\u2019m glad it worked out for them, but it seemed strange that they\u2019d do something that would ultimately separate them and make things so ghastly sad for the other person--if they truly loved the other person. Unless somehow Abby knew from looking into the future that it would work out the right way? But, if so, that wasn\u2019t conveyed well at all! Also, just because she knew doesn\u2019t mean Dante did. Weird!!Also INCREDIBLY irritating: Why didn't Abby have more interaction with the past? Why didn\u2019t she meet Da Vinci?! And, I really wanted more interaction with past Dante--him falling in love with Abby in the past. This would have better explained his interest in her in the first book. (This is the idea I had at the beginning that I\u2019ve hung onto throughout the entire series and I am very disappointed that it didn\u2019t pan out\u2026 I really think the whole series would have played out better if it had progressed along these lines instead. )Regarding Sofia, I really thought she was a past girlfriend from the way she was discussed and I didn\u2019t understand making her a possible child instead. Or was Dante trying to secretly name a future child after an old girlfriend? Yuck! Also, wasn\u2019t a former \u201clover\u201d mentioned for Dante at the very beginning of these books? Why wouldn\u2019t she have been a factor in a trip to the past? (I always assumed the lover--Sofia--was Abby (following my idea). So, if not her, than who was it??).And the locket thing seemed really stupid on Dante\u2019s part--particularly when he saw that Abby had lost her memory. Why not say, \u201dLet me keep that safe for you until you get your memory back\u201d and hold onto it himself? Really dumb!Finally, I was really confused about the time travel with Abby. How was she able to return to her home time so easily (and without a return door)? I thought that was the big issue in the first book with Dante, Zo, etc. that they couldn\u2019t return to their original time without the return door\u2026 Another inconsistency? Or did I miss something\u2026? I really never understood the river/time travel in these books anyway--how they could just fall into the river and end up at an exact and ideal place/time. Sometimes it seemed modifiable--other times not."}, {"userName": "Jessica (Books: A true story)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1113710-jessica-books-a-true-story", "userReview": "This book is also reviewed on my blog Books: A true storyI think the best way to describe The Forgotten Locket was melodramatic. \u00a0Meaning that it felt so dramatic that I was disconnected from it. \u00a0It was more entertaining when I read it in my head with a super dramatic voice.I was honestly kind of bored while reading this. \u00a0Abby is rescued from her problems too quickly so they didn't seem that dire to me. \u00a0It was also painfully obvious how things would resolve since the really big threats were taken away too fast. \u00a0There seemed to be no rules and if there were rules they quickly found ways to \"break\" them to do the \"impossible.\" \u00a0So everything seemed possible and it made it feel like there were no problems because there will always be a magical solution. \u00a0Not only that but EVERY problem was completely solved with a very nice bow on top.I hated that most of the world building was unexplained. \u00a0\"Impossible\" things happen (though since the rules are extremely loose a better word than impossible would be \"new\"). \u00a0And the explanation for events was mostly \"who knows just cuz.\" \u00a0That was the answer more often than I allow for a story to be interesting. \u00a0This world kind of feels like it was made up as it went along.\u00a0And I could have driven a DeLorean through all those plot holes in the way time travel worked.\u00a0I felt like I didn't have to think or imagine for this whole book. \u00a0This whole series.And oh the romance. It was nice I guess to read about a guy who always stood by his girl and did the right thing but it was highly unrealistic. \u00a0They never fought. Ever. \u00a0Except maybe about who loved the other person more. Gag.I know one star is a harsh rating and I usually only give it for books that I didn't finish, but I really should have put this one down and walked away. \u00a0I knew exactly what was going to happen so the only reason I finished is because of my need not to quit on books. \u00a0 I know a lot of people liked this series but it was really not for me.Overall, poor world building and an extremely predictable ending really dragged this story down.Wow that conclusion had plot holes so big I could drive my delorean through it.

When she does, Dante is prevented from answering by a convenient distraction. In this book it's revealed that Sophia is Dante and Abby's imaginary daughter that Dante made up to tell his parents about in letters after they went back to the future. Aww, isn't that sweet, and how evil of Zo to twist it all around and make it sound like Dante had another girl back in the day . . . except the Dante that made up Sophia was future time-lord-or-whatever Dante, NOT original-timeline Dante. When Abby asks him who Sophia is back in the first book, he hasn't made Sophia up yet. Which leaves us with two possibilities: first, the glaring, gaping plot hole of Zo telling Abby to ask about Sophia when there's no way for Zo to know about Sophia because she doesn't exist yet OR second, the shoddy attempt to cover said hole - but if Zo knows about Sophia before Dante makes her up that means that Dante must have named his and Abby's pretend daughter - and, presumably, the real daughter they'll have sometime after the end of the series - after some old flame.

I'm also 9 months pregnant so my mind is probably a little more sensitive than normal. On the positive side, these books were a great fictional read. At first I was worried it was going to turn into a \"twilight-esce\" book. I was happy to discover it was not about vampires. I was intrigued to discover it was about time travel. It is another young adult fiction series, which sometimes makes me hesitate. However, I appreciated the development of the characters and their relationships. It wasn't too sappy, too high-school, or at all inappropriate. I liked that. It was more focused on telling a great story. I also liked the different settings in this series. I was fascinated when they travel back to Italy 1501. How cool that would be. The ideas in this book are fun, even if far fetched. If you want a quick, simple, fictional book, you may enjoy his series.On the negative side, I really struggled with the details. Sometimes the author would be describing a scene or a moment, and I found myself completely lost in descriptive words that I had no idea what was going on. The author describes things with so many senses that often I just didn't get it. It's also very difficult to follow the time (river) vs. timelessness (bank), and understand how the characters could manuver to and from, and in between. I found it strange that the characters could summon magical healing powers, drops of sunlight, by focusing on a word, a poem, or a song. Ultimately, at the end of the series I was happy with the way it ended, I just didn't walk away actually understanding much of it - but c'mon, its time travel. Who actually understands that, right? I couldn't explain it to someone if I tried. I'd really be interested in other peoples point of view on this series. It was recommended by a friend of mine.

The first book was good and had so much potential but unfortunately the author forgot that truly remarkable books have truly developed characters and relationships. Instead, the last two books focused on the weird \"bank\" and river. But even though the author spent so much time describing these areas, as well as the antagonist, Zo, they were quite forgettable in the end. The \"magic\" didn't quite feel real because there were almost no limitations to the magic. Limitations and rules that govern magic are what make the magic believable. But Zo seemed to be able to do anything and go anywhere. Whereas, the others characters were inept, confused or stuck in some ambiguous part of the bank. Which leads me to my biggest frustration with these series... the complete failure to develop Dante as a character. Dante had the potential to be the most interesting and lovable character and hero. But in the last two books he is pushed to the background and we hardly see him. We read that he and Abby \"love\" each other so much. But there is absolutely no basis for their deep love. Are we supposed to believe that him seeing her once, briefly, in some dark dungeon is the foundation for his \"deep\" love for her?! I kept waiting to read about how Dante met and got to know Abby in his time, before he was imprisoned and went through the door. I kept hoping we would see how Dante fell in love with Abby there so that we could understand his devotion to her in her time period. I kept waiting for the kiss that would happen to explain why Dante told Abby she was the one that taught him how to kiss her. But in the end I was disappointed and left with a sense of what should have been.In the end this was a forgettable and unremarkable series because I was not attached to any of the characters."}, {"userName": "Cydnie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742779-cydnie", "userReview": "Reading the final book of this series was like going on a long awaited vacation - you plan for it, you wait, you enjoy every minute it, and then when it's almost over [if you're like me...] you start to get a little sad and a bit depressed because it's coming to an end! I almost didn't want to finish the last few chapters because I didn't want it to be done - yeah, so I'm a dork!I have enjoyed the development of the story over the course of the three books. One of my favorite characters is still Valerie - she is crazy, but 'sees' what others can't or don't. I enjoyed meeting the young Leo/Orlando. I am always amazed at authors who are able to weave storylines and characters throughout a series of books so well that while you are reading you keep saying, \"What does that mean? Why did they do that? Etc...\", but after reading the series everything makes sense and my questions are answered. I tend to read neurotically and have a hard time waiting for things to make sense. I actually wrote the author after The Hourglass Door and listed my questions. She was sweet enough to write back and basically say, \"Be patient, they will be answered later.\" [Although my original questions about the dates on their wrist not being correct is still off - but not mentioned in the subsequent books]There was a couple of moments during the book that I thought, \"Hmmm, this is weird/confusing\", and I quickly read over it to get to the next part.

How did they moved on with their lives?I felt like she changed some things like in the first book The Hourglass Door Dante said that he had a lover and her name was Sophie. Now in this book Sophie is the name of his daughter? That was a problem for me. Next who was this Giovanni that was mentioned in The Golden Spiral? When did he go through the Time Machine? Was that part about how to developed photographs the old way was something she through in just to make The Golden Spiral a bigger book, there wasn't a real point to that, or did she deliberately changed some of her rules? I loved how she wrote Zo's character; brilliant. He is possibly the best antagonist that was ever written. Valerie's character was also brilliantly written. Showing her one way, then having her loose sanity. Valerie's new character, her insane character was just brilliant! I didn't liked the love triangle. At the end of this book Mangum had a choice, she could have let Valerie stay with Leo in the past. Leo and Valerie was forming an attachment, but she chose to keep them friends, little disappointed there, but not much. I also didn't understand why Dante and Abby would throw-a-way his heart.

If we can follow the story of several characters being doubled up, why can't they just follow their own? The fact that even though they looked down the river (Dante's gift??) . . . they couldn't see what Zo saw? To be able to plan ahead like he did? And the ever obvious ... If Zo could go back in time (as a Time Master) and obliterate/change upcoming events to obliterate people/change history . . . Why can't Dante(also a Time Master)? Couldn't Dante have just gone back to Zo's cell and killed him before he went into the machine? Then Abby could appear before Dante, he goes into the machine . . . and all is well. Right?

The constant metaphors for \"darkness\" and \"pain\" are distracting (\"as dark as eyes closed as midnight\", or \"...a sharp pain racing from my hip to my ankle, like someone had stretched a rubber band next to my bone and then lit it on fire.\") What??Additionally, after reading the entire trilogy, I STILL don't understand all the business with the \"river of time\" and the \"bank\" and how some people are \"tied to the bank\" and others can't go through the \"black door\" again. It's very convoluted, and never seems to be explained very well. And the things that Abby is able to do with time in this book?

And then, once he is no longer tied to the bank, you don't hear anything more about him."}, {"userName": "Amber", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14073835-amber", "userReview": "A happy ending! I love it when everything works out in the end. I wasn't positive that it all would end up ok. Our hero was in peril for most of this book, and it seemed that the villain had the upper hand. But our heroine... nothing can stop her! At one point she looked at all of the work ahead of her to defeat the bad guy and put everything to rights, and she broke down. She lost faith for a minute because it seemed to be an insurmountable mountain to climb, but the consequences of her giving up were too much to pay. I thought that it was a really great life lesson. Even though this is a work of fiction, and I doubt that anyone will ever have to hunt down a bad guy that is intent on destroying time, I think it is definitely something worth teaching. No matter how dull the immediate future looks, no matter how much work it's going to take, it will be worth it in the end. You have to put in the work to make your future better. Great lesson, and great story! Five out of five stars to The Forgotten Locket!"}, {"userName": "Shelby", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5410237-shelby", "userReview": "[ With Dante losing his power of time, he can share his life with Abby all nice and well.

Personal taste, totally subjective, but again, I am a logically-driven person. If it's too far away from anything resembling logic (this was) then I have trouble thoroughly enjoying it. I sincerely hope Mangum will write something a *little* more mainstream next. I hope she stays in fantasy as she is fabulous, but this book, well, I felt like the first 3/4 of the setting was in the same room in the Apothecary shop. It felt so stagnant, even though plenty happened. I think the whole story was extremely ambitious for a first-time writer and I applaud her efforts.The other thing that put a huge damper on my ability to enjoy this book, was the way she resolved it in the end. I'm sorry, but I just couldn't appreciate the \"all-magical mysterious time power\" of Abby's that magically fixed everything in the end. There are about 100 other ways that I could have thought to fix the story that didn't involve inventing something pinch-hit-like at the end. To name a few:1. DO SOMETHING TO ZO'S PAST. If he can kill Dante back in time, why can't Abby do the same to Zo's past? If not she herself, have DANTE do it!? So silly. This was the #1 obvious choice on fixing the timeline. But whatever.2. PREVENT ZO GOING THROUGH THE DOOR THE SECOND TIME. This was still never EVER logically explained away. Why it was better to have him GO through the door. I mean, come on, if you're going to write a time book, what is the point of a time travel story if you CAN'T go back in time and change anything. Change Dante getting blinded, Change V getting killed by Zo... THERE'S SO MUCH to fix and change that she never even threw that in as a possibility. Yes they went back in time, but they changed things by accident and as the opportunity arose--not due to intention. So.. inevitably, she painted her plot into a corner and the only way out was Abby's magical powers. Uh huh. I can't express enough my disappointment. I really wish she would have explained better how one determines WHEN in time one travels when going through the door. It was implied that this was done through the Roman Numeral tattoos on the wrists. But Abby never had those tattoos. Perhaps that was why she went to the beginning of when the door was built, but she didn't exactly, she only went as far back as when Orlando RETURNED through the door--how he did that we never found out either. In the end, I found this a very engaging, interesting read, but the 2nd two books were so irritating to me that I don't intend to read them again. I think I will quite enjoy reading Book 1 again now that I know the entire story. Extremely creative no doubt, but time travel suggests logical puzzles that CAN'T be solved. I should've known better. Oh yeah.. and the title was totally silly. Has absolutely nothing to do with the mass of the book. A better title would've been something like \"Fixing the River\" or \"Murky River\" or \"The Unraveling Bank\" or \"Closing the Loop.\""}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1009204-cindy", "userReview": "The Hourglass Door Trilogy has slowly become one of those series I couldn't wait to read the next book in. When I read the first novel, The Hourglass Door, I was a little taken aback. I loved the characters and the plot but there were some elements, mainly the time traveling and river, that left me a little confused. Jump ahead to the second book, The Golden Spiral, and things really picked up. There was action, adventure, and the characters continued to grow and develop right before my eyes. The one downside? It ended in a cliffhanger and like every fantasy reader cliffhangers just make me want to read the next book immediately. So now, we've come to the end of the Hourglass Door Trilogy and I have to say that The Forgotten Locket is the perfect ending to a wonderful and amazing series. Lisa Mangum absolutely knows how to take a story, develop it right before your eyes and wrap it up with no loose ends. Everything that I loved about the previous two books, mainly the characterizations and plot line, continued throughout The Forgotten Locket. Abby, Dante, Zo and Valerie continued to become fleshed out characters that are multi-dimensional. So many authors get wrapped up in ending the series that they forget to let the characters continue to grow. Luckily for readers, Lisa Mangum seized the opportunity to let her characters grow while finishing the series. The Forgotten Locket is just as much a page turner as the previous books in the series. However, I did start to feel the novel drag a little towards the end but this could be because things were wrapping up and the plot was starting to come full circle. One of the elements that I was still a little confused about, the river of time, really did come together in the end. After reading all three books it makes sense. It still might be a little confusing if you just take it at face value in the first or second book, but when you put all three together it just fits. While I really enjoyed the characters and plot development, what I absolutely loved about The Forgotten Locket was the way that Lisa Mangum tied everything together. Little clues that were dropped in previous novels are brought back and explained in further detail. I thought this was a nice touch and a great way to acknowledge the previous novels without rehashing everything for the readers. Overall, I thought this was a perfect way to end the series. In fact, I couldn't think of a better way to end it if I had written it. There was just the right blend of sweet romance between Abby and Dante, and heart pounding action between Dante, Zo and Abby. I really believe that because this series bares the stigma of \"YA romance/fantasy\" it is overlooked by many people who would enjoy it. Lisa Mangum is an amazingly gifted author who really hit the fantasy scene with an outstanding debut. While the door for this series comes to a close, I really can't wait to see what new door opens for Lisa Mangum as I am almost certain that this will not be the last we hear from her."}, {"userName": "Christy LoveOfBooks", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390723-christy-loveofbooks", "userReview": "The Forgotten Locket is the final book in The Hourglass Trilogy. Instead of having to wait a year between each book, I was able to read all three in the span of three months, so my memory of the books were still fresh. After reading The Spiral Staircase (book two), I was hoping the Author would pull everything together in this one, and she pretty much did. I don't think I could say that I liked this book better than the first two. Honestly, the second book is the best in the trilogy, in my opinion. Mangum writes beautifully, and I love the use of songs and poems in the book, but it seemed like the majority of the book was filler. It just kept going on and on with Dante and Abby saving each other - back and forth. It wasn't until maybe the last 6 or 7 chapters that it actually got to the point of why they were there (I won't say exactly where). Even though everything connected to the first and second book, there was something that was never really explained. I wanted to know who Sofia was so badly, because she was mentioned a few times mysteriously in the first two books. When she was mentioned in this book, I thought finally it will be explained, but no... all I got was an indication of who it might be and then they shrugged it off. AND if it's who they kind of suggested it could be, then that doesn't even make sense with what was said in the first two books. That kind of stuff annoys me.Something I really liked about the book was how all the characters who went through the hourglass door had their own unique abilities. For instance Abby could speak the language of time, Dante could see the future in the river of time, and Valerie had the ability to see how peoples' stories would play out depending on the choices they make. Valerie was my favorite character - what can I say, I like them a little crazy. I also love how Orlando refuses to make wishes because he feels like they are just reminders of what you don't have.So... I liked the book because it ended the story and brought closer to the first two books, except for the blasted Sofia issue. As for the trilogy, overall... it was pretty good. I'm glad I read them."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4343865-cindy", "userReview": "Absolutely amazing!! I have loved this story from the first book. It just keeps getting better and better with each book, if that's possible. I love the premise of the story, time travel through a time machine made by Da Vinci, brilliant! The world that Mrs. Mangum creates on the bank of the river and the river it's self was wonderful. I could picture this amazing river, flowing and rumbling with the pictures of time. Now however the river of time is in danger and Abby, and Dante need to heal it and close the circle of time. This final book in the Hour Glass series takes us on the complex journey of saving time, and all the things that our favorite characters; Abby, Dante, Orlando,Val, Lorenzo(not so favorite/with wrong goals in mind, he is a great villain I have to admit) will go through and what sacrifices they will make to accomplish their goals. From the first page I was riveted and so anxious this story just plows through were it left off. I love Abby and Dante's love and caring nature for each other, the author does a great job showing us how much they love and care for each other. Abby is still that strong and vivacious, girl willing to do what ever to save those she loves. Dante is strong, confident, amazing, and gentle with Abby so swoon worthy. They have the love that dreams are made of. Orlando was great in this story too, and some things are revealed to help round out his character and fill in the lope holes or questions I had about him. Great description throughout story as well felt like I was there for all these wonderful and anxious moments that happend. I am actually sad to leave these characters that I enjoyed so much! I loved how it all ended,it was wonderful!

There were some major problems for me in this book, though. First, I felt like she did some foreshadowing in the first two books that were never answer in the final book. For instance, why spend so much time and heavy emphasis on taking pictures to preserve time in the second book when it barely receives one or two lines of attention in the 3rd book. Also, she kept mentioning Sofia int he first two books. All that came out of that is a one-liner that indicates Sofia is a future daughter. What's with that?Because these books were so different, I really felt like I was reading after-thought sequels rather than one compelling story that was broken into three different books. The books had the same characters and kind of the same story, but the plots were so vastly different. It seems to me that she thought up the stories as she went along rather than knowing the whole plot line at the beginning. That leads to very disjointed work.If authors insist on writing sequels, they still need to do the work of making one complete story line before they ever publish the first book."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/904176-beth", "userReview": "This book had so much wrong with it, I'm not sure where to start. But I feel that a one-star rating deserves some explanation, so here are a few of the lowlights: - A plot that runs in meandering circles with no sense of momentum or direction - A main character that seems to lose personality as the series goes on instead of develop one - A villain that is seemingly all-powerful, but spends most of his time in clich\u00e9d evil banter - A world and system of supernatural that is confusing and inconsistent - A hero that is nauseatingly perfect - Numberless descriptions of long looks and special kisses - The unexplainable tendency of everyone to fall in love with the main character - A writing style that lacks emotional connection or clear directionI know many people have rated this book much higher, and I'm sorry to be so harsh.

I was glad for a couple of scenes that through off the predictability of the storyline. The premise behind the locket itself was pretty interesting, though I would have liked to have had more explanation on several things. Like how exactly the locket was Dante's heart, and how music and the river were connected. The idea of gifts given through those that went through the door was also interesting, but I would have liked to understand that better as well. Not a stand-alone book.

When the hero's on the verge of death more than once and the heroine comes to the rescue yet again it becomes a little anticlimactic.
