I could not have chosen better. This story was suspenseful, educational and deeply emotional. With an age range of 5 years-old to 88 years-old in the car, this book managed to hold all of attention.Like most readers, I've read plenty of books set during the WWII era. Some were graphic and shocking in their descriptions of the horrendous acts that took place. Others, like 'Number the Stars' go a far more subtle route, choosing to leave much to your imagination, while providing just enough information so that the reader can figure out exactly what is going on. With two children in the car, subtle and less graphic was an obvious benefit. However, I was amazed by the depth of understanding my 9 year-old had of the story that unfolded. I was incredibly impressed by the way the author was able to craft a story that appealed to such a broad audience. Set in a German-occupied Denmark in WWII, 'Number the Stars' tells the story of a teenaged Annemarie Johansen. She and her family helped rescue her best friend, Ellen Rosen, and her family. The two girls had grown up together. Like their daughters, the parents were best friends also, having been neighbors for years.When the German occupation becomes increasingly hostile, the writing is on the wall for the Jews. The Johansen's are ordinary people that took extraordinary risks to stand against injustice in the only way they knew how. They become active in the resistance movement, helping to smuggle targeted groups of people to safety.I don't want to give too much away, because this is a story that I believe should be read and experienced by everyone. I will say that it was deeply sentimental and thought-provoking. There was plenty of action and suspense to keep you on the edge of your seat, but nothing too terrifying or gory for children. This is the first WWII book that I've read about the Danish resistance movement. I greatly enjoyed learning about the Danish culture and the role that Denmark played in WWII. The stories about the King of Denmark were especially inspiring. Mostly, this story was inspirational. It is about everyday people that do incredibly courageous things when backed into a corner. It is about the strength of the human spirit. This is the kind of book that makes you reevaluate your values and what you consider important in life. Everyone needs a reminder every once in a while, especially as the holidays approach. I loved every minute of this story. It is another one that should probably make the \"mandatory reading\" list for school-aged children, lest we forget the lessons of the past. The audio was fabulous as well. I highly recommend this book to everyone."}, {"userName": "stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86145-stephanie", "userReview": "i read this in hardback, when it first came out, and i'd say it was probably the reason i became addicted to WWII/holocaust literature/history at such a young age. i think it helped that i was so young when i read this, as imagining a ten year old standing up to nazis was something remarkable, but imaginable for me. i loved annemarie, i identified with her in ways i can't really explain. i read this book again and again, and it never changed. there are scenes burned into my memory: the fake funeral, the ripping of ellen's necklace, annemarie with the special packet, the idea of all the jews packed into uncle henrik's boat. and annemarie running, running fast like she did at school when she beat all the boys, running with a basket and a red cape (only later would i figure out the clever little red riding hood allusion), her blond hair trailing. it also helped that i had great-grandmothers who remembered the war, a swedish au pair who told me about seeing denmark from sweden, and an insatiable curiosity about things like this - so i was looking up things on maps and reading about german shepherds and the \"scent rags\" and. even when it was card-catalogs and old books, i was a cross referencer. i have notes somewhere of my favorite quotes from the book. i also love the ending - because it doesn't condescend. the ending, unlike the book, is ambigious in its ending. we know the war is over, we know annemarie survived - but what does that mean for a little girl, after all?"}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this beautifully written Historical Fiction story which I believe was written for children and yet adults may well find it such a worthwhile and enjoyable read as wellThe evacuation of Jews from Nazi-held Denmark is one of the great untold stories of World War II. On September 29, 1943, word got out in Denmark that Jews were to be detained and then sent to the death camps. Within hours the Danish resistance, population and police arranged a small flotilla to herd 7,000 Jews to Sweden. Lois Lowry fictionalizes a true-story account to bring this courageous tale to life. She brings the experience to life through the eyes of 10-year-old Annemarie Johannesen, whose family harbors her best friend, Ellen Rosen, on the eve of the round-up and helps smuggles Ellen's family out of the country. A short book will just enough historical detail to educate a young (and not so young reader) and interesting and likeable characters, I loved the bravery and courage of Danish people and how they looked out for their neighbours. Its a beautiful story full of hope and suspense and I certainly enjoyed every moment. I look forward to reading some Non Fiction books about this time in Denmark's history.I listened to this on audible and at under 3 hours its such a great book to escape with back to a different time."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1300229-jennifer", "userReview": "I know- I can't believe I'm just now reading this. What kind of a children's librarian am I?This is a nice little story about a family who smuggles some Jewish friends out of Denmark during the Nazi occupation in 1943. I always avoided reading this because it looked depressing, but it wasn't. It wasn't a light story, but it didn't have the horrible scenes that fill most holocaust books.However, the author's note at the end affected me deeply. I don't know a lot about my Danish heritage- I've always thought it was a sort of boring one. Most people I've known are descended from Danes, or some Scandinavian mix. Other than the Vikings, there's never seemed to be much of interest there. I've always envied my non-Scandinavian friends' more (in my mind) exotic backgrounds.I was amazed to read, though, of the courage and kindness of the Danes during WWII. The afterword spoke of the weeks in 1943 when the Danes smuggled almost their entire Jewish population out of Denmark- nearly 7000 people- to save them from the Nazi death camps. Astonishing. It makes me want to learn more about where I came from."}, {"userName": "Chris Horsefield", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14058695-chris-horsefield", "userReview": "Lowry doesn't waste a word in NUMBER THE STARS, starting with Annemarie and Ellen's frightening run-in with German soldiers in the opening chapter. In quick strokes, Lowry establishes the setting and characters and foreshadows Annemarie's subsequent encounters with soldiers, each of which increases the tension. The symbol of stars weaves in and out: When the crowd of escaping Jews gathers, they are comforted with the words of Psalm 147: \"O praise the Lord ... he who numbers the stars one by one.\" \"How can anyone number the stars?\" Annemarie wonders.My favorite part of the book is when Ellen and AnneMarie are looking out over the bay and they say that's Swedan over there. The fact that they talk about Swedan shows me that they are hopeful, curious, and anxious.Anyone who is interested in the Holocaust or the lives of Jewish families and their friends should read this book. I think this is a book I will always remember. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone who is looking for a good read."}, {"userName": "Werner", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/903390-werner", "userReview": "C. S. Lewis famously wrote something to the effect that a children's book so bland and simplistic that it could appeal only to children probably has nothing of much real worth to offer to a child reader, either. He was right; the best and truest (in the sense of Mary E. Wilkins' Freeman's comment that \"All fiction should be true\") stories written for children speak just as profoundly to adults. This book is a powerful illustration of that reality. At 137 pages (counting the Afterword) of fairly large print, it's a quick read, which I blazed though in three days; and the language and diction, while not dumbed down in any sense, is simple enough for readers as young as the 10-year-old protagonist to understand. But the depth of meaning in a story isn't determined by the length of time and verbiage it takes to tell, and the very simplicity of the tale heightens its impact immensely. (It's the perfect length for the effect Lowry wanted to create.) Like all great fiction, it's set in a particular time and place (here, Nazi-occupied Denmark in 1943), and happens to a viewpoint character with particular demographic characteristics --a little girl-- but it leads all of us, of whatever age, gender, and nationality, to identify with her in the universal human issues and experiences that lie behind the particulars.The Holocaust is a subject that's inherently harrowing. Until now, I've avoided Holocaust fiction (and read very little nonfiction devoted to it, except for The Hiding Place: The Triumphant True Story of Corrie Ten Boom), simply because I already know what happened and don't want to drown myself in stark tragedy. This book, however, manages to bring a ray of light into that dark time: it's fictionalized, but it focuses on the real-life rescue of virtually the entire Jewish population of Denmark, smuggled by the Danish Resistance to safety in Sweden. (This isn't a spoiler, since the jacket copy provides that information.) It remains a story that looks human evil full in the face; incidents large and small drive home to the reader the ugliness of the Nazi's treatment of both Jews and Danish Gentiles. And even for readers who've read the jacket, Lowry conjures a palpable atmosphere of gripping tension and danger, especially in Chapters 8-15. But ultimately this is a story of the triumph of the human spirit and of human decency.Lowry's messages are about toleration of differences between people, about cross-cultural and inter-religious friendship, and about the obligation of \"ordinary\" people to find the stuff to be heroes and heroines when circumstances call for it --lived out here in the object lesson, especially, of a small girl who's believably called upon to face enormous danger, in the face of her own fear. (The plot is excellently crafted.).Lowry (1937- ) has twice won the coveted Newbery Award, once for this book. (IMO, that award was well deserved.) She's writing here of events in her own lifetime; but because she's going back to the time when she was an even smaller child than Annemarie here, and lived through World War II in the U.S. rather than in Denmark, she didn't grow up knowing the background of this book, and had to research it much as she would have a historical fiction novel. (The Afterword tells how she came to be inspired with this project, and what aspects of the book are factual --and a LOT of it is.) She did her homework well. I'd recommend this book to readers, young and old, who like World War II historical fiction, as well as general fiction; but really, to every reader. And this late-in-life first introduction to Lowry has definitely whetted my interest in reading more of her work!"}, {"userName": "Presley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/468484-presley", "userReview": "Number the Stars \t\t\t Bantam Doubleday Dell,1989, 152 pp., $5.99Lois Lowery \t\t\t\t ISBN 0-06-447073-3\t\u201cAnnemarie looked up, panting, just as she reached the corner.

Young Annemarie Johansen\u2019s life is drastically altered, between her disappearing neighbors, rations on food and Nazi soldiers on every corner. When the invasion in her neighborhood begins to progress and get serious, Annemarie learns that the war is effecting her a lot more than she ever imagined it would.

By the end of the story she knew that there needed to be change and she would help in any way to make that happen.

I\u2019m happy I chose this classic children\u2019s story \u2013 it left a positive and lasting impression on many for a good reason. It mainly focuses on Annemarie Johnansen and her parents helping another family during the dreadful Nazi period in 1943. Apparently her uncle is part of an underground support group for Jews in the area as well. Despite it being such a dark period in history, reading about the experiences \u2013 especially with people who make a difference \u2013 are interesting. The author keeps it relatively short due to the age group, but a full fledged story happens in the 137 pages. The beauty of the title is tied into scripture verses relating to the stars, as the main character sits in wonder and asks herself how it would be possible for someone to be able to number the stars. The drugged handkerchief helping throw off the scents from hunting dogs was a new one by me.The simplistic writing style fits well with children\u2019s fiction but the author has a healthy hand with foreshadowing and putting a lot of hope into the words. Not everything is realistic but that\u2019s not unusual with Historical children\u2019s fiction either. It may inspire blurry eyes a time or two, but it\u2019s not overly depressing - there\u2019s a redeeming hope.

So this drug was made of rabbit's blood and cocaine, the dogs used to get attracted to blood and with the cocaine's smell they'd loose their sense of smelling and couldn't find the suspected person.

I suppose a lot of that comes from her age, and the fact that this was written for children, but as I read it I felt that I would have absolutely loved this when I was younger. (As it is, I still found it highly enjoyable)!One thing I loved was the fact that the story takes place in Denmark. I honestly knew next to nothing about Nazis outside of Germany, so I actually learned a lot by reading this.Also, I felt as if I was stepping right into Annemarie's world. All the little bits were there\u2014all the little things that bring color to the world in your imagination. The scenery, the characters, family history, names of cities and streets, small phrases in German, the food (or lack of), the fact that electricity was rationed... and I found the backstory of Lise and Peter, and Peter's ultimate fate, to be sweet in the saddest way. And also, can we just talk about Annemarie's little sister Kirsti for a minute?? That child was something else. xD She added a certain spice to the book that I enjoyed. I also liked seeing the Danes band together and help their Jewish neighbors at risk of great personal cost, as well as learning more about the role Sweden played. I may be a little biased, but I found myself thinking, \"Aw yeah!\" whenever Sweden helped out. (I'm 1/8th Swedish).The only reason I didn't give it five stars (and this might sound petty), was the fact that it didn't quite swallow me up the way good books usually do. I enjoyed reading it, 100%\u2014I learned a lot, and was really invested in the characters' lives by the end\u2014there was just a certain something missing in that department.The final verdict: I was super excited to find this book in Goodwill one day, and I was not disappointed!"}, {"userName": "Mulligan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1431592-mulligan", "userReview": "Number the Stars by Lois Lowry takes place in Denmark during World War II and the Holocaust. The story begins with an introduction to the cruelty of German soldiers who are occupying Denmark, the story's heroine, Annemarie, her younger (and more bratty), and her best friend Ellen Rosen. From there, this young adult novel tells a tale of bravery.Soon after the beginning of the story, the Nazi soldiers begin attempting to take Denmark's Jewish citizens away to concentration camps (read: starvation and eventual death). As this happens, other Danish citizens and members of a secret movement, the Resistance, protect their Jewish neighbors and begin smuggling them to safety in Sweden. Eventually, Annemarie's family smuggle Ellen Rosen, a young Jewish girl, to their relative's house near Sweden. It is there that the story unfolds and the suspense begins. One of the best things about Number the Stars, for me, was the way Annemarie demonstrated quiet bravery in the face of danger. Her character showed that it doesn't take brute strength and power to be a hero. Because of that message alone (and maybe also the simple, but beautiful writing), I would highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Yoda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7508449-yoda", "userReview": "Story takes place in 1943, Nazi occupied Denmark, we follow story of ten year old Annemarie and her best friend, Ellen, who is jewish.

What if you read this twenty years ago and have had two kids and subsequent serious sleep deprivation since then??Well, I can't remember items on my shopping list while I'm at the store, but I remembered a surprising number of details from this book once I started reading: the whole first scene of the three girls being stopped by Nazi soldiers on a Copenhagen street corner, the image of the Star of David charm imprinting itself on Annamarie's hand, the climactic walk to the fishing boat and being stopped by the soldiers with dogs. The scenes that had been subconsciously hidden in my mind for years unearthed themselves as I turned the pages -- indeed, it is a memorable book.The story is a courageous tale of fictional ten-year-old Annemarie -- and of the real citizens of World War II Denmark, who swiftly united to smuggle their Jewish population to Sweden, which was well worth learning about. Additionally, the writing is superb: somehow, Lowry manages to weave detail and plot together in a way that enriches young (and old) readers while not overwhelming them.

The cover doesn't represent it very well, so I was a little surprised. I expected it to be dramatic and maybe even a little scary. And yes, it was a bit frightening at times and it was intense, but ... it was also really sweet. Annemarie's voice was quite adorable.Overall, this was a great book that I really enjoyed. It was too short, though! *sighs*~Kellyn Roth, Reveries Reviews"}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307208-lucy", "userReview": "I love Lois Lowry. The Giver is one of my all-time favorite books. She has a way of explaining a complex idea or lesson in a simple, but not at all dumbed down way. Lowry's story of a young girl living in Denmark during the Nazi occupation, and trying to understand who the Nazis are and what their presence means does just that. When Annemarie Johansen's best friend, Ellen Rose,who is Jewish, moves in with her family and pretends to be her dead sister because her parents are forced to go into hiding in order to avoid being \"relocated\", the questions that arise about why the secrecy is necessary becomes a perfect first exposure to a young reader not experienced with the brutality and horror of the holocaust. Lowry doesn't shy away from any of the fear, cowardliness, bravery, anger, deception, confusion, or strength shown by those who lived through this dark time in history. However, she unfolds the story through the eyes of ten year-old Annemarie so the story is appropriate for that age group. I think this is the very best of young adult or children's literature. Compelling, honest, well-written and important. Highly recommended."}], "description": "Librarian's Note: For an alternate cover edition of the same ISBN, click here or here.Ten-year-old Annemarie Johansen and her best friend Ellen Rosen often think about life before the war.
