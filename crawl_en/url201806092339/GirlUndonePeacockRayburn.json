It only got worse from there. The characters were poorly constructed. I didn't need two or three descriptions of someone's outfit. Once was enough, thank you. There were places where the wrong name was used when referring to characters. Sentences either repeated words or simply omitted them. I'm starting to wonder if Editors even exist anymore. There were too many mistakes, not just in the writing but in the storyline as well, for this to be considered worth a read. FYI: Ms. Madison, JR will have to be portrayed as a genius if you choose to take this farther since he's only one and on a developmental level of a two or three year old. Child development was probably your easiest research and you failed on that too."}, {"userName": "Ju Haghverdian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8257586-ju-haghverdian", "userReview": "[2.5 stars] This story was a mess of discombobulated weird events.I have not read the other books but I have a feeling I would be very disappointed if I had read the previous 2 and got to this one to find out it was more of a continuation of events that should have been resolved/closed on the previous book, and more.. the end had a cliff-hanger that leads to a conclusion that the crime was still not resolved.I felt like the writer did not know where to focus on. TJ was hired to find out what happened to Rina's niece who disappeared for a few days and showed up drugged at a mall... ok this is one story.In parallel a crime blogger is being harassed by a possible copycat who is killing women and wants his killings to be publicized. It was just too many events and too many people out of nowhere that made the story hard to follow and uninteresting."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7035327-denise", "userReview": "I really wanted to like this book. The plot started off decently,\u00a0 but I quickly found myself struggling to keep up with the multitude of characters introduced. None of the characters were likeable either. The author's style of writing was frustrating, in addition to the various grammatical and formatting errors. I guess there's a reason it was free on bookbub.\u00a0 I also didn't see the point in the main character dropping the g's on her words,\u00a0 especially when 1. None of the other characters spoke like that and 2. She was the only character clearly described as a person of color \ud83e\udd14Too many unanswered questions at the end and no desire to read anything else from this series or author."}, {"userName": "Marsha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9084927-marsha", "userReview": "This was a good, fun book. There were several plots twisted around each other, and when one was done, it didn't conclude the others! I would have given the book of fourth jar, but the format was pathetic! Another proof-reading would have added immensely! Tenses and misuse of pronouns was the least of it. When \"it\" gets used for \"if\", it changes the entire meaning! I am known to be picky about my grammar, but I don't think that was the problem entirely! Work on punctuation, spelling, usage, and grammar in general!!"}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6772332-shannon", "userReview": "Story was hard to follow - very convoluted. A lot of different characters introduced in the very beginning which made it hard to keep them straight. Harder still when the author sometimes referred to a character by first name & sometimes by last name. There were gaps in the story. Often I would be starting a new chapter and feel lost like I had missed something. I finished the book still not sure how everything related. Only finished this one for the sake of finishing."}, {"userName": "Dawn Raker", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62982521-dawn-raker", "userReview": "Girl Undone by Marla MadisonI received this book for free because of a giveaway on Facebook!This book was well written and keeps you turning pages from beginning to end!

There are two storylines (= an unlikely tale of stolen embryonic eggs from a young girl's body, and the stalking of a blogger by a character who may or may not be a serial killer) which then overlap towards the end of the novel. Several typos, the mystery of who the 'girl' of the title is supposed to be, and the (for me) irritating use of initials for the private investigator and her son make this a crime series I won't be continuing reading!"}, {"userName": "G.G.

The typos and missing words were distracting for one.

One moment Marla Madison makes you think that you got it, you figured it out and right after it you sit dumbfounded, who could ever think that it may turn this way? These are precious feelings which make a crime story worth reading. The main characters of this novel - TJ Peacock, a private investigator, and Lisa Rayburn, a psychologist - try to catch a serial killer whose hunger for celebrity is so huge that he makes a popular criminal blogger to write about him in his blog. Finally the blogger asks TJ and his colleague for help, fearing for his life. When all the characters gathered in one house, not knowing who the murderer is and who the next victim is, I remembered the feelings that I had reading Agatha Christie\u2019s \u201cAnd then there were none\u201d. The tension so high, million thoughts swarming in my head I tried to solve the puzzle that glorious Ms. Madison had given. And I\u2019ll tell you what \u2013 don\u2019t even bother if you are not a Sherlock Holmes of our times. The twists and turns, billion details, characters.. the author knows how to bewilder the reader.Marla Madison is a revelation for me, and I\u2019d happy to continue the acquaintance with her works."}], "description": "TJ and Lisa are hired by a woman whose niece disappears under mysterious circumstances.
