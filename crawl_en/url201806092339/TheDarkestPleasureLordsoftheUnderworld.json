I'm making Reyes the newest addition to my harem. I'll treat him well.Long ago, twelve immortal warriors opened Pandora's box, unleashing the demons from inside. As punishment, the warriors were forced to house those demons inside themselves. Violence, Pain, Death, Disease, Disaster, Misery, Doubt, Promiscuity, Defeat, Lies, Secrets, and Wrath.Reyes had once been a warrior, whose duty it was to protect the gods. He was now a Lord of the Underworld, possessed by the spirit of pain. \nDanika has lived a sheltered existence- until she takes a disastrous trip to Budapest that forever changes her world. (yeah crazy shit happens in Europe) Now she must depend on her wits and resourcefulness for survival.\nShe learns how to defend herself.\n Every day of that week she and Gilly had taken self-defense lessons, learning how to kick, hit and yes, kill with lethal precision. Besides her family, those lessons were the only thing Danika lived for anymore. She would never be helpless again. Reyes' troubles never seem to end. Ever since he first saw Danika, he'd been enchanted with her. She sees him a threat, even a monster. Yet she can't deny the attraction to the Lord of the Underworld. Reyes mustn't get too close to the woman he desires, for fear of hurting her. \nI love love Reyes. He treated Danika with utmost care and respect. He put her needs first, her safety more important than his own.  Monster, she reminded herself. He\u2019s a monster. \nI'm stopping here because I don't want to spoil any major plot points. \n \u201cYou came for me,\u201d she said. Part of her had hoped for just such a thing; part of her had feared it. \u201cYes,\u201d he repeated. \u201cWhy?\u201d\u201cI have a feeling I will always come for you.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Blacky *Romance Addict*", "userReviewDate": "Jul 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8310179-blacky-romance-addict", "userReview": "[Cameo, in the last two books they were spending a lot of time together and even laughing!!

This is one of my favorite instalments that, not only has likeable MCs but also introduces us to a few new characters that will play important roles in the future. It also gives us an inside on how the Titans operate and what Cronus really wants.Reyes and Danika, as a couple, truly work in my opinion. I think they\u2019re very compatible and they bring the best out of each other. Danika shows Reyes the good and kind and the love and Reyes does the same but he also gives her a bit of the darkness they both can tolerate and enjoy and that\u2019s great. I didn\u2019t have a single issue with them nor with the plot. I also liked the rest of the Lords and William and Ashlyn and Anya. I never once doubted their role in the book and I\u2019m thirsty for some girl-bounding, man. Paris, Aeron and Sabin were the ones that developed the most in this book and it\u2019ll be interesting to see how the author will make them grow.I\u2019d say this book is one of the strongest of the series because it gives what it promises. It accomplished exactly what it meant, closed the deal with the main couple and helped the plotline as a whole and I\u2019m very intrigued by Danika\u2019s powers. I can\u2019t recall if they\u2019re explored later in the series but she might as well be the most powerful of the artifacts because, if she could incapacitate a god, she could transport them to hell, right? I\u2019ll be extra careful from now and see if they mention something like that."}, {"userName": "Michelle ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23450274-michelle", "userReview": "3.5-4 Cut Me Deep Stars!This is the third book in the Lords of the Underworld PNR series. The story of Reyes and Danika. Reyes has the pain demon inside of him. The only time he feels any kind of pleasure is when he hurts himself. That is until he meets Danika in book one.Aeron the keeper of the wrath demon has been summoned by the king to kill Danika and her family. The brothers took matters in their own hand and locked Aeron up so he couldn't do as the king requested. This leaves Danika and her family on the run. They spit up and never stay in the same place for long. Danika is working at a diner. Hunters know Danika was captured by the Warriors and they want to know what she seen while there. Danika puts up a fight and she kills one of the hunters. While packing up her few belongings to run Aeron finds her. Of course Reyes is there to stop him and tells her to run. Reyes then chains Aeron up far in the ground. Aeron is so close to hell that he makes a friend. Legion is a demon minion. He/She loves to play games with Areron. Legion also seems to calm the wrath demon. I loved Legion! While on the run Danika is captured by the demon hunters. They want to use her as bait to get information from the demons. Danika is confused with what to do because she can't stop thinking about Reyes. How he saved her. The hunters finally convince her to help them after filling her with lies. Does Danika help the hunters or does she finally admit to herself that she has feelings for Reyes? Does Aeron break free from his chains again and succeed at killing Danika and her family? Why not a five star you say? Well...there was a lot of re-telling of the two previous books in this one. I skimmed a lot during the first 40%. I'm sure it would of been a great thing if you were reading these when they first came out. It would of been a nice refresher for you after a long wait. But me...I was bored with it because everything was still very fresh in my mind. I wanted to get to the good stuff. Haha! I love how in each book we get chapters on the other warriors. My heart is breaking for Paris! I had tears in my eyes when he had a decision to make. Then I was yelling yay!!!The ending in this one seemed a bit on the perfect side to me. But also left me wanting more. I'm happy to say I will be moving on to the next book. I can't stop now. lol They are off to Egypt!! I can't wait to see what's in store for the fierce Sabin the keeper of doubt! His story is next:))"}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "Although this series had a shaky start, I am really loving it. Heck, I'm a sucker for Greek mythology, so that helps. Throw in a tortured hero, and the battle's practically won. But, really, these are good stories, and I could tell that Gena Showalter is finding her groove. This series is much darker than her Atlantis series, and quite violent. But then, it's about Immortal, demon-possessed warriors. Comes with the territory. These books are also very steamy. Not too steamy, though. Reyes was very tortured. I mean, what a curse! To have to hurt oneself to feel pleasure, or to maintain one's sanity. In a way, it was almost sickening for me, to see him carving himself with knives and hurting himself, relishing being horribly wounded by others. There was a bit of an ick factor there for me. Having said that, I was okay reading this story. I think that this was an iffy story, but the execution was well-done. I'm so not into that painful/pleasurable sex storyline, but I kept reading. I was glad that Ms. Showalter managed to keep most of that out of the sex scenes. Otherwise, oh, I would have been way out of comfort zones.I loved how tender Reyes was with Danika, even when I didn't think she deserved his devotion. I tried really hard not to judge Danika, knowing that she was just being a human who was in a rough situation. But, I thought I would hate her forever when she started working with the Hunters. I was crying, \"No. That's so wrong.\" In my mind, it was. The Lords didn't hurt her at all. They let her family go and protected her. Yes, Aeron was off his rocker, but it was clear that they were going to do their best to protect her and her family. So, I was on the edge of hating poor Danika. It was a see-saw with me. I was glad that Reyes was aware that she was considering betraying him. With his eyes open, I felt better about his willingness to show her such loving, selfless devotion. A girl can only be so lucky. In the end, I was okay with Danika, although I much prefer Anya and Ashlyn. Reyes loves her so much, I can't hate the girl, after all. And, I ended up liking the reveal when it came to what Danika truly was.This series is building nicely. I am eager to read about the other Lords' stories. My heart goes out to poor Paris. I hope he is able to get a happy ending. It was great seeing Lucien and Anya, and Maddox and Ashlyn in their gushy lovey-dovey-ness. I loved all the smart alecky comments and sarcastic quips from the gang, as well. Anya makes me laugh, her and William. Lucien is sigh-worthy. I just love him. Gideon cracks me up with his lies! Sabin made me want to slap him in some scenes, and feel very sad for him in others. I hope she writes a story for poor Cameo. Maybe there will be a man who can love her despite the misery she inspires in those who hear her voice and see her face. The Hunters got on my ever-living nerves. Initially, I didn't like them as the main villains at all. But it turned out to be a solid source of intrigue, especially with the developments with a former Lord. I liked that Ms. Showalter took the Greek mythology and took it in a novel direction by focusing on the Titans.Honestly, this would have been five stars, were it not for my intermittent dislike of Danika. Otherwise, it was an enthralling read that I found hard to put down. After this one, I'll take a break and read something else, so I don't run out of these books. But, I'm excited to continue this series."}, {"userName": "Pavlina Read more sleep less blog\u2764\u2764  ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6603203-pavlina-read-more-sleep-less-blog", "userReview": "I loved it!!!One of my favorite books!!There was a lot that I liked about this book!The plot,the characters and generally the world Genna creates.In this book, we focus on Reyes and Danika.Reyes is the keeper of the Demon of Pain and Danika is on the run from Wrath who has been commanded by the Titans to kill Danika and the rest of her family.

We've been waiting since book 1 to see Reyes's unrequited love for Danika reach its foregone conclusion and Showalter doesn't disappoint.As in past books this is an ensemble piece, involving the continuing stories of past immortals and their now mates, as well as those Demons yet to have their stories told. Rather than distracting I found all these characters only added to the story in a very `Brothers' living in the mansion kind of way. I love the bantering between the warriors who at the same time respect each others torturous curses. This dysfunctional family unit continues to change and grow, all the while maintaining their constant search for Pandora's Box and fighting off the ever threatening `Hunters.' Reyes is kinda sexy but he's been cursed with the demon of pain. To avoid hurting others (and feel some pleasure himself) he must satisfy the demon by either releasing it during a fight or self inflicting pain. I.e. cutting or stabbing himself, although he has also been known to jump off the roof of a building just to feel his bones break and hear the demon purr. Reyes was introduced to Danika Way back in The Darkest Night and he's never been able to forget her. She unfortunately was targeted by Cronus the new King of the Titans and along with her family sentenced to death. To make matters worse it was Reyes's best friend Aeron ordered with upholding the death sentence and the longer he's kept from this task the more bloodthirsty his own demon Wrath has become. In fact Aeron's become so crazed that he's been locked in the dungeon where he's trying to chew off his own hands to escape the shackles. Reyes can't bear to see his friend like this but he can't allow Aeron to kill Danika either and will fight him to the death if need be. Meanwhile Danika remains on the run, now separated from her family she fears that they may all be dead and in an attempt to find and protect them strikes up a deal with the `Hunters' allowing herself to be used as `Bait' against the immortals. Once inside the castle walls however her resolve starts to fail. Something draws her to Reyes, this man who warms her skin and haunts her dreams. He has shown her nothing but safety and kindness and she has come to desire him, demon and all. Reyes in turn is pretty much useless, unable to concentrate on anything except getting Danika into his bed and keeping her safe from the bloodthirsty Aeron. Now if only he could figure out where Danika's loyalties lie and why Cronus wants her dead they could all live happily ever after. This was a great read and anyone invested in the series won't be disappointed. Besides the love story there are some excellent sub-plots. (Paris's story is getting progressively heartbreaking *sigh*) My only regret here would be the surprisingly mundane love scenes. Given the subject materiel I guess I expected a little more, I mean pain=BDSM right? Unfortunately (or fortunately?) Reyes wants to keep things gentle and not exploit Danika's dark, kinky side.

I very much enjoyed \"The Darkest Pleasure\" and found the expansion of the storyline pretty fascinating. It's easy to see after reading this one that Showalter and Harlequin have big plans for this series. We finally meet the shadowy leader of the Hunters, and his identity is quite the surprise. We also find another of the artifacts needed on the quest to find Pandora's missing box. We learn a little more history and a little more about the scope of the battles to come. But mostly we learn about Reyes and Danika.Reyes' past was very difficult. Learning about the history behind his efforts to leash Pain was, well...rather painful (no pun intended). The lengths he was willing to go to in order to spare humans-just wow. All he wants is a respite from Pain, a little peace where he doesn't have to leash his demon. He finds that in Danika, but fears that having Danika will expose her to the taint of his demon, and he's very unwilling to do that. So he can't keep her and he can't let her go either.Danika always wanted to be normal, but she never was. She can't seem to come to grips with that and I disliked her intensely for almost half the book. But I can say that she redeems herself beautifully and I think these two are a perfect pair.Neither trusts the other and each of them apparently betrays their loved ones at some point in this book. I really didn't like that. However, haven't we all betrayed someone we love in some way in our lives? I guess that's just part of being fallible and it's nice to know that sometimes our heroes and heroines are fallible too. In all, I think the progression of their relationship was just as it needed to be. Without all the missteps, misunderstandings, and mistakes they would never have gotten to such a strong ending. And the ending of this book is worth missing a few hours of sleep!Now for my rant. I'm ticked that I have to wait 16 months, yes folks that's November of freaking 2009 for book 4. Books 5 & 6 are scheduled to follow in Feb and May 2010 respectively. Come on already...a year is understandable, but almost a year and a half? Why publish the current releases now? Why not delay their release a couple of months each? I'm actually a tad (!?@#) pissed at Harlequin for this and would be interested to hear their marketing strategy. It would have to be a really good one to risk alienating fans with such a long wait when there are plenty of competitive paranormal series out there without such a long gap between books."}, {"userName": "Felicia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia", "userReview": "God, what to say.

Reyes, Keeper of the demon Pain, has suffered immensely because of his need to constantly cut himself. He hates that his demon finds pleasure from slicing a blade through sinew and bone. Where others would be shocked and disgusted to witness such a thing, Pain finds bliss. From the very beginning, I was very intrigued with Reyes because of his demon and the fact that he isn\u2019t the friendliest of the Lords. What can I say? I love a tortured hero.On the other hand, the heroine, Danika Ford has become one of my favourite women in this series. Danika possesses a quiet strength. Though she may think herself as helpless and scared, she has proven her courage and strength in many ways. I loved the fact that she still cares deeply about her family. Typically, once a romance begins, all other storylines are placed in the background where the focus is on building up the relationship. But in this case, the relationship between Danika and Reyes grows stronger because of Danika\u2019s ability to love. Her ties never sever from her family even though they are kept apart. And her link to Reyes doesn\u2019t waver either.We find out that Danika is the All-Seeing Eye, one of the artifacts that the Lords and the Hunters have been desperately seeking. Dani has the ability to see into the depths of hell and witness the gods in heaven. With this unique talent, she has become a very valuable possession that others would kill to obtain. But somehow Reyes realized how valuable Danika was even before he knew of her ability. One of my favourite parts of the book is when Danika finds the art studio that Reyes had set up for her. It was such a kind and considerate gift that shows how much he cared for her. Naturally, I was expecting some BDSM because Reyes reacts to pleasure and pain in equal measures. But I think Showalter managed to keep things interesting without going down that route. Because Reyes fears that Danika will fall into bloodlust as his previous lovers had, he keeps himself distanced from her in an attempt to prevent her corruption. However, they both find a way to enjoy each other without the hurt. But if Reyes needs to relieve himself, he should get a hold of the Brotherhood and ask Vishious to teach him a thing or two. Or call UGH (1-800-SHADE) to borrow some gags and flogs.I just want to mention how happy I am that Paris chose Aeron. It was such a selfless thing to do and shows just how much the Lords care for each other. I hope he gets his HEA soon because he deserves to be happy. Also, Aeron suffers a lot in this one too. Despite his demon clamouring around in his head, Aeron found the will power to stop himself from rendering the killing blow on Danika\u2019s grandmother. I can\u2019t say how much I enjoyed this book. It\u2019s one of my favourites of the series and I can\u2019t recommend it enough!"}, {"userName": "K\u00fcbra Ya\u011fmur", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36997724-k-bra-ya-mur", "userReview": "Her yere ad\u0131n\u0131 kaz\u0131mak istiyorum REYESSSSS.Ama \u00f6yle b\u00f6yle de\u011fil kanl\u0131 kanl\u0131, ac\u0131l\u0131 ac\u0131l\u0131.

She morphed from sweet and innocent to believing--with a few courses in self-defense--she could kick the demons butt (Aeron) that was after her. The constant love/hate that went on between the h/h was annoying. Danika's agreement to act as Bait for the Hunters' had me not liking her. Reyes wants her, but afraid he'll ruin her/won't let her go/but keeps her at a distance/can't wait to see her...all this turns me right off a book. Black hair dye does not wash out in two shampoos! I hated the fact that Reyes had to have pain to experience pleasure. Big (BIG) sad face on that alone. His demon was pain. He jumped off a building to experience the pain of shattered bones while the others joked about hiding his internal organs--like they did an earlier time. Yuck.Top all that with the author using filler to re-tell what just happened was annoying, imo. The author did a fine job refreshing events in earlier books. I've read a \"few books\" since and it was good having the details again. But, there was no need to re-explain what I just read in this book. Argh!Throughout most of The Darkest Pleasure, Paris (demon: promiscuity) story gets set up. For me, doubtful I will continue this series. I'm so burned out on paranormal books that they really have to be exceptional to hold my interest and a book about a man who can't have sex with the same person twice (male/female) is a another big turn-off for me.

Even an immortal warrior, who can only find pleasure in bone-wrenching pain. Reyes is one of the Lords of the Underworld. Each immortal carries within him a demon which escaped from hell. Reyes carries Pain, and longs to hurt himself and others. He cuts himself, breaks his own bones, whatever it takes to cause pain and soothe the beast inside of him.We knew Danika was the woman for him back in The Darkest Night. But he resisted his feelings for her because he was afraid his demon would taint her. Well, that and the fact that his best bud Aeron is fighting a Titan-induced compulsion to kill her. But three books later, Reyes is finally giving in to his desires. Danika's life has been turned upside down since she came under the Lords' radar. She's been on the run, hiding from Lords and Hunters alike. She's been forced to harden herself, to live in poverty. And in the end, it's not enough. Hunters catch up with her and that leads Reyes back into her life, because he must save her.The couple is thrown together, as Reyes vows to protect Danika and she works to find the rest of her missing family. And even though they're both fighting it, their attraction is undeniable. Now, I know there are a lot of people out there who find pleasure in some degree of pain. And skirting that line can be a turn-on. It just isn't for me. And that put a big damper on the book, because, obviously, Reyes IS Pain. There is one particularly disturbing scene in the bathroom with Reyes and a knife... Suffice it to say, it icked me out.And yet, despite this, it was a good book. Even with the pain thing, the book was rich in sexual tension, which Showalter plays like a violin. The great world building continues. I felt so much anguish for Paris... sympathy for all the lonely Lords, each with such burdens to bear. These books are sexy romances, but they're also more. In short order, Showalter has helped us grow emotionally invested in this immortal family.

HMMMMMOkay, this story has been played somewhat in the other books. It just delves deeper in this book. Reyes is the demon of Pain. He has got to hurt all the time to satisfy his demons needs. Danika has had nightmares since childhood, horrid nightmares. After she has them she paints what she has seen in her dreams.Aeron, Keeper of Doubt, has been ordered by Cronus, King of the Titans to destroy Danika and all of her family.This story has to deal with trust, love, friendship and sacrifice. From Reyes to Danika, to Aeron to a female demon by the name of Legion, this book tells a great story. The sacrifice that Paris makes for them all is great and hurts him to the core.If the rest off these books are as good as the first 3 I will be hoping for a movie or a TV series, something to further the stories. Just great writing and great characters"}, {"userName": "Suzanne (Under the Covers Book blog)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3575839-suzanne-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "Another great installment in the LOTU series! Reyes and Danika were a cute couple and I am glad they finally got together. Although Reyes isn'y my fave Lord he is still a great hero, I only put him under hero-i-want-to-hurt cos I know he will like it!Apart from the Danika and Reyes parts I also liked the glimpses into Paris and Aeron's mind as well. My poor Paris! I can't wait to see how it plays out with him."}], "description": "Reyes is a man possessed. Bound by the demon of pain, he is forbidden to know pleasure.

For months she's eluded the Lords of the Underworld, immortal warriors who won't rest until she and her family have been destroyed. But her dreams are haunted by Reyes, the warrior whose searing touch she can't forget.
