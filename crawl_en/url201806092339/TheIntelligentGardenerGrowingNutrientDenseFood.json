You won't get information on many aspects of growing nutrient-dense food, like variety selection and time of harvest, out of this book. What The Intelligent Gardener does provide, though, is well worth the price.I've been nibbling around the edges of learning about soil testing for the last couple of years, but this book turned my understanding into a full (and nutrient-dense) meal. Solomon's work is based largely on Albrecht's studies of the optimal ratios of cations (calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium), with a lot of updates from the more modern work of Astera. Solomon breaks it all down into simple worksheets that anyone can fill out with a calculator able to multiply, add, and subtract.A second warning is due --- you'll need to put quite a bit of cash into Solomon's method if you have a large homestead. Solomon's math only works if you do a Mehlich 3 soil test, which is about $20 per sample from a few select labs; then, you'll probably be committing to adding several hundred dollars' worth of amendments (like gypsum) to get your soil back in balance.Even if you don't want to go the scientific route, though, this book is worth it for its explanation of the chemistry of soil. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16086956-robin", "userReview": "Reading the other (glowing) reviews, I wonder what I'm missing here. I did not love this book. The author actually implies that the AMA blatantly disregards knowledge of poor soil fertility leading to human disease to further it's own monetary interests in treating those diseases. Um, no. I can get behind assuring our soil is appropriately mineralized to grow nutrient rich food - I'm going to test the soil of our veggie plot and amend the beds appropriately. I can even believe fertilizer manufacturers would have farmers believing that traditional commercial fertilizer is all they need. But a conspiracy by doctors? Give me a break.And the microbiologist / geneticist in me reels at his assertions that the plague ( and other bacterial or genetically-influenced disease) only affects those eating food grown from nutrient poor soil. I'm sorry, but being \"already convinced\" *without* a study being done is ridiculous. Sure, just make totally unfounded assertions and call yourself intelligent. Gah. This book drove me crazy."}, {"userName": "Kathely", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6252035-kathely", "userReview": "Too complicated.

Solomon, in my opinion, has long been ahead of the pack as evidenced by his books \u201cGrowing Vegetables West of the Cascades\u201d and \u201cGardening When It Counts.\u201d Through his early gardening experiences and from starting the Territorial Seed business he devised his Complete Organic Fertilizer (COF) which was an attempt to balance garden soil. COF is still a good way to go for people who don\u2019t wish to go any farther and the formula is easily found on the internet. (Also in The Intelligent Gardener pps. 84-85).In the last half dozen years through association with Michael Astera\u2019s Nutrient Dense Project and a re-study of the work of scientists like William Albrecht and Victor Tiedjens, Steve Solomon has become a convert to the concept of \u201cnutrient dense.\u201dThe concept of nutrient dense food is pretty simple. The gardener works over time to balance the soil with the proper mix of minerals. The result will be soil that encourages the life forms (worms, bacteria, etc.) that help with soil symbiosis and soil that provides the nutrients plants need to grow properly. Balanced soil will mean healthier plants, resistant to pests. Balanced soil will result in food that is nutrient dense, providing us with the vitamins and minerals we need to be healthy.Steve Solomon spends a lot of time debunking the concept promoted by J.I. Rodale that compost would solve all problems and that by continuing to heap organic matter on a garden a garden would only get better and better. This is not the case as Solomon explains in detail in a chapter titled: SAMOA (The Shit Method of Agriculture). More important is bringing calcium and magnesium into proper balance. When garden soil is properly balanced, according to Solomon, the garden will create its own nitrates.Balancing calcium, magnesium, potassium, sulphur, sodium and other minerals is the key to nutrient dense food. Getting this balance correct begins with a $20 soil test. Then, with a copy of The Intelligent Gardener in hand, one can use the worksheets provided to come up with a prescription for a custom fertilizer designed for one\u2019s own garden. Solomon\u2019s colleague and co-author, California gardener Erica Reinheimer has developed a website where you can find copies of the worksheets found in Steve\u2019s book. On this same website you will find a link to \u201cOrganiCalc\u201d which allows you, for a small fee, to compute your custom fertilizer prescription on line."}, {"userName": "S\u00e9bastien", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12221895-s-bastien", "userReview": "\"Le Batterie de Cuisine\"! Really? Batterie is a feminine noun so it requires a \"la\" not a \"le\". People use French just to make it seem more sophisticated. Nothing sounds worse than mixing the masculine and feminine. This coming from an author who proudly names his book the \"Intelligent Gardener\". In other words, he's saying \"organic gardeners\" are stupid. Well, this author belly-flopped right after self-declaring his high intelligence - and that even before page number one!Aside from this blunder, there seems to be more science and fewer organic mantras. It is practical and rich in information but what the....le batterie? I pick up this book, eagerly start reading about cations, then I come across \"le batterie\" so now I want to throw this book in the compost!"}, {"userName": "Tad Hussey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27166576-tad-hussey", "userReview": "My only complaint is that he downplays the significance of the soil food web and nutrient cycling in the rhizosphere in my opinion.

Solomon presents a workbook (and points to the digital alternatives) that breaks down this process step-by-step, and spends most of the book explaining the importance of each step, caveats, and alternatives. He also shares the recipe for a \"Complete Organic Fertilizer\" based on this information. The source of this approach is author's interpretation of the Albrecht-Kinsey hypothesis of soil mineral balancing, a compelling alternative to conventional \"sufficient levels of available nutrients\" approach recommended by most university extension offices. I find this book especially valuable because it comes from the perspective a long-time organic grower and author who through personal experience over the years has become convinced that this soil test-based approach can improve upon conventional compost-focused backyard organic gardening. The author has changed his mind several times over the years based on new information, and admits to it, which I find honest and refreshing."}, {"userName": "Jean-marie Prevost", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23372629-jean-marie-prevost", "userReview": "Coming from a bunch of purely permaculture/organic gardening books and experiences, it was very interesting to get this sort of \"in between\" opinion that highlights some glaring weaknesses of various methods.What I personally didn't like about this book is that while accusing some organic gardening's myths and faulty reasoning, the author is guilty of some pretty \"bad science\" himself, jumping to conclusions from his own experiences as if they were facts a few times throughout the book. Nothing major, and mostly when the author speaks of stuff outside the scope of this book.Speaking of the scope of the book, as it's subtitle clearly states, it is all about growing nutrient dense food. It's not about general growing tips, growing lots of food, it's not necessarily about being the most organic you can be or about permaculture (though there are some interesting ideas on the subject); the main goal is growing food that has the highest nutrients vs calories."}, {"userName": "Rob", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41538467-rob", "userReview": "Hard book to review. This is a five-star book if it is scientifically accurate, and a one-star book if it's just a bunch of pseudo-science. Assuming that the truth is somewhere in the middle, and that the author has drawn a mixture of true and untrue conclusions from his (few) sources, I give the book three stars for being interesting, offering a fresh perspective on home gardening, and at least making an effort to sound scientific. I guess there isn't any harm in accepting the author's word as gospel and making some soil fertilization changes, but it's probably worth confirming some of this stuff w/ local horticulture departments and soil science graduates."}, {"userName": "Simone", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4922077-simone", "userReview": "Eccentric and repetitive but he makes some very important points.

Solomon goes beyond simply giving practical, common sense advice and looks to the science behind plant growth to give the whys and wherefores along with the hows. He has made be a believer in the soil test and, mea culpa, I will get one before next Spring. Though he can be preachy and at times acerbic, Solomon writes a good gardening book. Thankfully his tone has mellowed over the past decade. While I agree with much of Solomon's science and practical advice, I strongly disagree with his insistence that almost all health problems are caused by poor nutrition. While there is truth to the fact that nutrition is a big part of health, saying that a host of ailments can be cured by more nutritious food verges on magical thinking. Second, Solomon completely discounts \"Big Ag\" agricultural science, often to his detriment. Nevertheless, I recommend The Intelligent Gardener to anyone who grows food, albeit with a grain of salt or a pinch of ag lime."}, {"userName": "Mitch Allen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18861631-mitch-allen", "userReview": "Steve Solomon is a master.

As a result, the broccoli you consume today may have less than half of the vitamins and minerals that the equivalent serving would have contained a hundred years ago. This is a matter for serious concern, since poor nutrition has been linked to myriad health problems including cancer, heart disease, obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes. For optimum health we must increase the nutrient density of our foods to the levels enjoyed by previous generations.To grow produce of the highest nutritional quality the essential minerals lacking in our soil must be replaced, but this re-mineralization calls for far more attention to detail than the simple addition of composted manure or NPK fertilizers. The Intelligent Gardener demystifies the process while simultaneously debunking much of the false and misleading information perpetuated by both the conventional and organic agricultural movements. In doing so, it conclusively establishes the link between healthy soil, healthy food, and healthy people.This practical step-by-step guide and the accompanying customizable web-based spreadsheets go beyond organic and are essential tools for any serious gardener who cares about the quality of the produce they grow.Steve Solomon is the author of several landmark gardening books including Gardening When it Counts and Growing Vegetables West of the Cascades.
