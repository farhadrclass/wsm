I felt this book is a rare gem that few people know about. It was like listening to a wise grandma casting her pearls of wisdom that are still very applicable today. The thing I loved the most is that I think anyone could relate to Eleanor Roosevelt! She was an extraordinary woman, yet so ordinary(like you and me) at the same time.This is one that I will definitely read again."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "This is a great book that discusses what we should seek in a politician. Eleanor Roosevelt's control and calm is what I admire most. She was comfortable in her own skin by the time her husband and her best friend, Tommy, died, when she wrote this book. She was well situated financially, but it was more than that: she gives examples of people who never did learn, in all their years, how giving is more rewarding than taking, and sharing is what a good life is all about. And she ought to know. Eleanor Roosevelt became a force and a celebrity in her lifetime despite suffering in childhood from great shyness. She wasn\u2019t pretty and she was inexperienced, and in the man\u2019s world of the time, she was often underestimated. She learned early that discipline gave one some breathing space in a confusing and fast-paced world. This is a personal book, but because she was a public figure from marriage, she includes observations about public life as well. Many of the difficulties that are crippling us as citizens now were already apparent when she wrote this in the late 1950\u2019s. \"If people come up the financial ladder but still maintain a low educational standard, with its lack of appreciation of many of the things of artistic and spiritual value, the nation will not be able to grow to its real stature.\"This is true for our leaders as well. Not only do we need boldness in our leaders, we need a lack of corruption, and values that elevate the chores we must undertake to allow states their individuality at the same time they add heft and stability to the group we call a nation. \"Nobody really does anything alone.\" Our greatness, if we have any, is ever only displayed in relation to, in concert with, our fellow citizens. Like happiness, greatness means nothing in solitude. The last chapter of this book is called Learning to be a Public Servant. Our consciousness has been raised lately and we are much better aware of what we think constitutes a good public servant, so reading this chapter refreshes for us what kind of person we are looking for to lead us in government. The first thing E.R. notes in this chapter is that few people begin their careers planning to run for office. Politics provides an uncertain future because one\u2019s position comes up for reassessment every couple of years. And secondly, politics is not generally as remunerative as other careers. A competent person will be generally looking for stability and security in a career so that politics, if it comes up at all, is an accidental or situational possibility. If a person decides to run for office they must be sure they have enough money to do so: that is, they must be able to take the risk of losing the job again and therefore not be forced into compromises that tarnish either the candidate or the office.The family of the prospective politician must be thoroughly onboard with such an uncertain life in the public eye. And the politician must truly love people and his/her constituency to be able to spend all the time one needs to do the job well on their behalf. He/she is the conduit to introduce the particulars of his/her own state to the nation, to the world, and at the same time bring the world and the nation\u2019s interests back home to his state, explaining on both sides and seeking agreement between needs. E.R. talks about \u2018timing,\u2019 and how important it is for a politician to sense the best time to propose, the moment one can be assured one\u2019s attitudes will be rewarded with agreement and compliance. The politician must be able to move people towards new ideas and grasp the moment that is auspicious for general acceptance. It helps, she says, for a politician to be able to draw people to himself/herself. The only reason E.R. did not talk more about women in politics, she says, is because women seem to be more sensitive to criticism than men, and therefore take themselves out of the fray. Even that holds some truths for us today.We live in a world in a state of flux, she wrote in 1960\u2026\"The problems are new\u2026To meet these new challenges we look for new ingredients in our public servants, an elasticity and flexibility of mind that enables them to change to meet changes; an alert and hospitable intelligence that can grasp new issues, new conditions, new peoples. We look especially for a man who knows that he thinks and can make his views clearly understood without ambiguity or hedging\u2026It is no longer possible for us to look back over our shoulders if we are to keep abreast of our world, let alone maintain leadership. We cannot say \u201cNothing has changed,\u2019 or \u2018The old ways were best.\u2019 The point is that the old conditions are gone and we are left confronting the new.\"What is so very interesting about Eleanor Roosevelt is that she says she is an optimist but does not believe \u201ceverything will have a happy ending.\u201d She writes that she had seen too many examples where this was not true. Instead, she is congenitally hopeful, in part because she believes that we can remake our world when things get out of whack. And most instructive of all is what she says of youth:\"There is no human growth without the acceptance of responsibility and I think it should be developed as soon as it reasonably can be\u2026it is often people who refuse to assume any responsibility who are apt to be the sharpest critics of those who do\u2026Nearly every one of us, at some time or other, thinks what a great waste and pity it is that the older generation cannot teach the younger generation, cannot share their experiences, cannot save the young their mistakes\u2026and yet it is possible this is the best way. After all, so much that the older generation learned is wrong! And perhaps they didn\u2019t always learn as much by their experience as they thought they did.\"Most of the chapters begin with a strong statement, for instance: \"Happiness is a by-product, not a goal.\"The rest of the chapter is a casual, articulate discussion of the topic with examples from her life. It must have been the crowd she hung with, but juvenile delinquency referred to drunken brats from wealthy families making no effort to involve themselves with important themes and jobs. The poor, she theorizes, see how important they are to the cohesion and survival of the family group so they do not have similar problems.Look how things have changed in fifty years, that the poor see no future for themselves and so can sometimes set themselves at cross purposes to that of the larger society. This, and drug abuse rather than alcohol, have changed the dynamic. The wealthy have not as much security as before, so must continually scramble, besides the fact that the ceiling has been lifted on wealth. No longer is it crass, crude, and criminal to flaunt one\u2019s wealth in the faces of, and obtained at the expense of, those with less.E.R. is so grounded and unfussy, so kind and humble that we wonder if such a person could exist today. Much of what she says I recognize as the attitudes of earlier generations of women in my family. Those women are all dead now, but there is some comfort in reading someone articulate where they got their firm views about what is expected of individuals and citizens. This was a comforting, insightful book to read at this time, to give us perspective, and hope."}, {"userName": "Melissa Yael Winston", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1835423-melissa-yael-winston", "userReview": "In this book, Eleanor Roosevelt outlines eleven actions that each person must take in order to lead a fulfilling life. They are as follows:1. Learning to Learn--This first key makes the others possible. A fulfilled person must be curious and must learn to use his or her mind as a tool to understand and influence the world. Roosevelt insists that beyond discipline and training, a sense that life is an adventure makes people not only willing but passionate to learn about themselves, their fellow human beings, and the world. Interests cultivated by the curious mind beget new interests, which beget new interests, and so on, until the interested person is the fulfilled person.2. Fear, The Great Enemy--For a woman whose husband intoned, \"We have nothing to fear but fear itself,\" this key does not surprise the reader. \"Fear has always seemed to me to be the worst stumbling block which anyone has to face,\" Roosevelt writes. \"It is the great crippler.\" Roosevelt's suggestion for overcoming fear is self-discipline--once one has faced certain fears, the strength and confidence gained from those experiences foster the overcoming of new fears. On the flip side, not facing one's fears makes one weaker, and when one is weaker, one has a harder time facing other fears. \"Do the things that interest you and do them with all your heart. Don't be concerned about whether people are watching you or criticizing you. The chances are that they aren't paying any attention to you. It's your attention to yourself that is so stultifying.\"3. The Uses of Time--As someone who never feels like I'm productive enough, I was especially interested in Roosevelt's ideas on the subject. One statement, credited to a deceased relative, sticks out: \"We have all the time there is.\" Roosevelt solves the problem of the best way to use time in three ways: 1) achieving an inner calm that allows for one to function contentedly in a stressful environment, 2) concentrating on the task at hand (TAKE THAT MULTITASKING!!!), and 3) arranging the day so that certain tasks are completed at certain times, planning for everything that must be done, and remaining flexible enough to handle the unexpected. Roosevelt also stresses the importance of maintaining good health in order to facilitate the other methods. But these steps are secondary to having something to use one's time for. \"The most unhappy people in the world are those who face the days without knowing what to do with their time. But if you have more projects than you have time for, you are not going to be an unhappy person.\" One must decide what one's life (i.e. time) is going to count for, and then make it count.4. The Difficult Art of Maturity--Self-respect and self-knowledge as well as an understanding of one's limitations and the limitations of others are all crucial components of maturity. Another important factor is an awareness that as people, we are interdependent. Roosevelt stresses that teaching children as early as possible how little they can do alone is key to helping them become happy, productive adults. Being able to take and use criticism and evaluation are also indicators of maturity. At the top of the heap comes an awareness of one's own values. \"To be mature you have to realize what you value most.... Not to arrive at a clear understanding of one's own values is a tragic waste. You have missed the whole point of what life is for.\"5. Readjustment is Endless--Here is an interesting observation on Roosevelt's part: She states (correctly, I believe) that women have the advantage of being expected, to a greater extent than men, to make adjustments throughout their lives. The key to handling life is to adjust when necessary; happy people tend to be happy in spite of their circumstances, not because of them.6. Learning to be Useful--\"Happiness is not a goal, it's a by-product.\" One achieves fulfillment by having a sense of purpose. \"Usefulness, whatever form it may take, is the price we should pay for the air we breathe and the food we eat and the privilege of being alive.\" Roosevelt touts the importance of volunteer work, pointing out that needs exist for all kinds of people to do all kinds of work. One should express one's appreciation for living on this earth by helping others, regardless of monetary rewards.7. The Right to be an Individual--Roosevelt posits that in order to be fully human, one must assert one's individuality. Human nature is all about an innate drive to be oneself and to achieve self-actualization through various expressions of that self. \"It is a brave thing to have courage to be an individual; it is also, perhaps, a lonely thing. But it is better than not being an individual, which is to be nobody at all.\" Roosevelt lauds what she calls social conformity, which is basically the kind of behavior that allows people to co-exist in society, while decrying conformity to \"alien\" standards in order to go with the proverbial flow and achieve a level of acceptance by denying one's true self. Roosevelt refers to the keeping up with the Joneses as \"the real menaces of this country.\" (And, as we have seen in the years since she wrote this book in 1960, it's also a menace to our environment and the world.) Not only will one never reach the status of the Joneses, one will lose oneself in the effort. \"You can get rid of your neighbors, but you cannot get rid of yourself, so you are the person to be satisfied.\"8. How to get the Best out of People--Very little can be accomplished alone. A truly happy, fulfilled person will come to accept, learn from and use the strengths and weaknesses of others as a part of life. Roosevelt identifies two qualities one must have: one must be a good listener, and one must be able to empathize with others. People share more commonalities than they do differences; being able to see oneself as a member of the human race and learning to work with others in that race is crucial.9. Facing Responsibility--One statement in this chapter jumped out at me more so than others: \"I have often thought that so much attention is paid to the aggressive sins, such as violence and cruelty and greed with all their tragic effects, that too little attention is paid to the passive sins, such as apathy and laziness, which in the long run can have a more devastating and destructive effect upon society than the others.\" Passivity is a far graver and more insidious enemy in that it enables aggression, but it also gives people an excuse not to take responsibility. Is to abstain from building gas chambers the same as to fight for human rights? And at the same time, if the gas chambers are built, outfitted and used while one passively looks on, is one not responsible in some part for their existence? To be responsible, one must not only monitor one's behavior, but one must have the courage to speak out when others are doing wrong. But before any of that can happen, Roosevelt maintains that one must have the courage--and take the responsibility--to decide for oneself what is right and what is wrong.10. How Everyone Can Take Part in Politics--Bad news. Voting is a minimum, according to Roosevelt. Not only must one vote, but one must be educated about whom to vote for and what their stance on issues means in terms of its implications for the future. Challenging the \"If you lie down with dogs, you wake up with fleas\" argument, Roosevelt maintains that the only way to instill any sort of integrity into the dirty business of politics is to actively involve oneself in it, and, using integrity, reform it.11. Learning to be a Public Servant--If one chooses to be a public servant, the challenge comes in understanding, first of all, what that means. A public servant must serve, first and foremost, and be empathetic to the needs of his (and Roosevelt sticks to this pronoun) constituents. At the same time, a good public servant must not rely on his position for his livelihood; only a public servant with some other means of income can truly make the best decisions. Public servants must also have an ear for the suggestions of others but not get so bogged down in public opinion that they never do anything worth the effort for fear of offending someone.A good read, though I would have preferred more concrete examples from Roosevelt's own life and fewer anecdotes about those in her acquaintance."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12233359-sarah", "userReview": "I was surprised that I didn't enjoy this book more than I did.

If you fail anywhere along the line it will take away your confidence. You must make yourself succeed every time. YOU MUST DO THE THING YOU THiNK YOU CANNOT DO.\" Eleanor also discusses the uses of time, how to be a mature person, readjustment is endless, and learning to be useful. She shares her story of being with Harry Belafonte visiting 2 children's hospitals. \"The next afternoon I again saw him give of himself in the same way. Moving among the hospitalized children, making their eyes shine and their faces light with smiles because he gave them a word of encouragement. For a moment the braces or the cradle in which they lay was forgotten. They were well in their bodies because he satisfied their little souls.\" The remaining chapters in the book are: the right to be an individual; how to get the best out of people; how everyone can take part in politics, learning to be a public servant, and facing responsibility with this quote:\"We all create the person we become by our choices as we go through life.In a very real sense, by the time we are an adult,We are the sum total of the choices we have made.\"So much in this short book.

She found each person, conversation and experience a teacher, thus never being bored and certainly never being boring. My favorite quotes from it include: \u201cYou gain strength, courage and confidence by every experience in which you really stop to look fear in the face. You are able to say to yourself, 'I have lived through this horror. I can take the next thing that comes along.' You must do the thing you think you cannot do.\u201d As I am in my 30's and have faced personal struggles that I couldn't imagine getting past in my 20's, I realize how true this is. Anytime I have had something difficult, I keep thinking of the hardest things I weathered and I feel encouraged. I like that she didn't hear no and give up. \u201cWhat counts, in the long run, is not what you read; it is what you sift through your own mind; it is the ideas and impressions that are aroused in you by your reading. It is the ideas stirred in your own mind, the ideas which are a reflection of your own thinking, which make you an interesting person.\u201d This encouraged me to spend more time in reflection on what I am consuming and not just moving on immediately to the next thing.

It's a very short, easy read."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3471523-michelle", "userReview": "Some great bits of wisdom if you overlook the sexist bias of the times."}, {"userName": "Kelli", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1562368-kelli", "userReview": "The overtones of her political progressiveness were a bit hard to swallow.

According to my handy Kindle stats, I highlighted 62 passages (in a mere 212 page book) if that gives a sense for how much this book resonated with me.The lesson above all that I've continued to dwell on is that we are responsible for our own growth. We should teach children and ourselves the power that comes with learning how to learn, for \"why was your mind given you but to think things out for yourself?\" The ability to search a database worth of knowledge in an instant has in many ways crippled our ability to problem solve, to wrestle with ideas, and to bring our own experiences and insights into a resolution. What's beautiful about Mrs. Roosevelt's words on this topic is that they're 60 years old. This phenomenon is not new just because we have Google and iPhones and social media. My generation is not the first to neglect the hard work that comes with attaining knowledge, but we will cease to be interesting, relevant, and contributing members of society if we rest on our laurels.Highly recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3828046-susan", "userReview": "Eleanor Roosevelt was so wise!

She recognizes her own shortcomings with such honesty. Her attitude about learning and growing in all situations is so admirable and something that took her far in life. I especially liked it when she talked about what she learned from her husband and her position as First Lady. The final chapters about civic responsibility and public service were honesty and of particular interest to me given our current political situation. I highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Kayla", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23942385-kayla", "userReview": "I really enjoyed the beginning of this book, but at least half felt less relevant and even boring, which is unfortunate. There was definitely some class differences- she was talking about knowing what you want when your decorator comes or how sometimes the parties she went to were really dull. I\u2019ll turn on my highlights when I get the chance, because there really were some great parts in the beginning."}, {"userName": "Megan Helmer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49893255-megan-helmer", "userReview": "3.5 Stars - she wrote this in 1960 so yes, it\u2019s simple but it\u2019s also written in a very timeless manner.
