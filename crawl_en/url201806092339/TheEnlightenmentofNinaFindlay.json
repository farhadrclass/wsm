The novel describes her lifelong close friendship with Luca, her husband's brother. After Luca's wife dies, things fall apart. In Greece, at the opening of the novel Nina is hit by a bus, and hospitalized. Her life gets more complicated with a third man pursuing her. Although this sounds like a romance novel or chick lit, the construction of the novel kept me turning pages, and finding it hard to put down. Nina is an emotionally fragile soul, and rather than a train wreck, I found her a compelling character. The New York Times had an excellent review, but I was glad I hadn't read it because it revealed far too much of the story. I vastly prefer coming to a book without preconceptions or knowing too much of the story before I dive in.My computer shut down (it's never done that before) while I was writing this review earlier."}, {"userName": "Cleo Bannister", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3162627-cleo-bannister", "userReview": "Nina is hit by a bus in Greece and after surgery is taken to a small island hospital where she begins telling the story of her life to her under-worked doctor, Christos. She talks at length about her marriage to Paulo, her neighbour and friend since early childhood. Paulo has a younger brother Luca and all of their lives have been entangled throughout adulthood. Now twenty-five years after their honeymoon, on the same Greek island, Nina\u2019s support structure has crumbled and she needs to learn the lessons from the past to start afresh.Although the roots were in childhood Nina only married Paulo when Luca marries Francesca and the two couples spend time together although in the telling it appears that poor Francesca\u2019s position is slightly outside the early shared experience of the other three.The characters are well described and although I felt some sympathy with the young Nina her actions later on had me shaking my head at the fool-hardy way she behaved and made me feel that the endless adoration she had received from both brothers meant that only now, all these years later does she reflect and begin to learn from her actions. Does she succeed? Well you'll have to read the book to find out.This book is rich with fluctuating feelings as the book travels backwards and forwards through time, detailing in particular the shared bond between Nina and Luca and by default the impact that this has on Nina\u2019s marriage to his brother Paulo.For anyone who read Andrea Gillie\u2019s superb debut The White Lie, this is a very different type of book so comparisons are hard to make. What I can say is the writing is just as evocative, although the description of the Greek Island more muted due to the fact that Nina spent most of her time in the hospital, but the range of feelings, often contradictory were exceptionally well described.Underlying themes of loss, guilt and the transient nature of even the most powerful feelings means this book would lend itself well to a book club read but the intensity of the subject matter and the style of writing means that this could not be categorised as \u2018chick-lit\u2019"}, {"userName": "Victoria", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3049657-victoria", "userReview": "I think that this is a difficult novel to categorize. On its surface description, it sounds no different from many chick-lit novels, but its execution is not as frivolous. It is a novel that is constructed upon love triangles, some that take a while to be fully developed. And yet, it is a very engaging read. The tale is mostly from the titular Nina's perspective, but other characters also have their moments to share their thoughts. While on holiday, Nina breaks her leg and starts a relationship with her doctor as she tells him all while her broken leg heals. Nina very carefully examines her life and her motivations in relations with others and the narrative covers decades worth of time - more even than her twenty-five years of marriage. And though the book does move slowly, it is surprisingly easy to keep the pages turning.All of the characters here feel very genuine - and Gillies does a wonderful job with the patterns of choices and the sort of rippling effects of their repercussions which only make the characters feel all the more real. She nicely covers the long time frame of the book and it is a very thoughtful read and certainly one that I think will work well in book discussion groups. The ending, though, is not completely satisfying, as I had hoped for something far more definitive. Ultimately, though, I am not sure that any other ending would have felt as genuine."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3721149-carolyn", "userReview": "Do you have one of those female friends who thinks that every man is attracted to her, and walks around oozing sexuality, but in fact, really looks ridiculous. This is usually the friend that people tolerate when she discusses all the \"boys\" she is with. (We're in our 40's, if we are dating \"boys\" we have a BIG problem). I have a friend like this, who shall remain nameless, but I refer to her an my `insufferable friend`. I love the word `insufferable`. it brings to mind Victorian era women, for whom being courted by eligible bachelors are their `raison d`\u00e8tre`, and can not speak about ANYTHING but all the eligible bachelors courting them. There is a ridiculousness and foolishness to all this feigned evasive distress over the opposite sex these women spend their time considering. Well...this book is exactly that; INSUFFERABLE. I got to about 70 pages in, and lord help us if not every man this woman comes across is attracted to her and falling all over themselves wanting to be with her. Enough. I can`t continue. It is foolish and unrealistic. This is my silly friend, but in book form. UGH."}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "More Like EndarklementIt starts well, you can say that for it. \"When the minibus came round the sharpest bend of the descent, trundling along in poor light on the stony dirt road, its driver failed, at first, to see the woman standing taking photographs. He didn't see her until just before he ran into her.\" The woman, Nina Findlay, a forty-something Scottish visitor to this small Greek island, is absent-mindedly humming a song. \"It was a song that was meaningful to her and her situation. It wasn't about her husband, who'd reacted stoically to the news that she wanted a divorce, but about her husband's brother, a man who had loved her and whom she had loved.\"Well, there you have it. There is a spectacular crash, but miraculously nobody is really hurt except for Nina, who breaks a leg. As a result, she has to stay an implausibly long time in an implausibly pretty hospital under the care of the implausibly attractive Doctor Christos, who seems to have nothing better to do than to listen to Nina telling him the mess she has made of her life. As she develops a crush on the doctor, who of course studied in America and thus speaks perfect English, I could see we were descending rapidly into mid-life chick-lit. Good for a beach read, perhaps, but really too emotionally incestuous even for that.Most of the book is back-story. Nina grew up near Edinburgh next door to an Italian family with two sons: Paolo and Luca. Luca was her best friend, but she married Paolo. It is immediately clear there have been some indiscretions, though the author is an infuriating tease about revealing just what they are. At one point, Nina tells Christos that she has a big confession to make; a dozen pages later, he asks her if she has made it yet, because nothing she has said seems all that earth-shaking. All right, she loved two brothers at the same time in different ways, so what? So Andrea Gillies complicates the back-story still further, throwing in Nina's parents, Luca's wife, and a couple of deaths that will make everybody feel guilty. But it is just too darned incestuous, as I say, too willfully engineered. There are a few surprises towards the end, a kind of self-deluding-narrator thing that will please some readers. But to reach Enlightenment do you really have to go through Endarklement first?"}, {"userName": "Nene La Beet", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2557032-nene-la-beet", "userReview": "I liked this book a lot, probably better than I liked the previous one. Several reasons for that, I think, one being that I'm not much for thrillers, generally, another that Nina Findlay and I have a lot in common - not least our gender and age.This book takes issue with two important things, closely related. It looks at how women past menopause become invisible to the world in many respects. And it looks at how this affects the women's perception of themselves. These are important issues and I think about them and struggle with them every day.About the book and the story: It has some unlikely plot twists, but I really don't mind. Some of the very best novels and films have completely inconceivable plot twists, but they are there to let the author tell us something important, and I value that far above plausibility.Nina Findlay is a woman on the brink of a divorce - a divorce from her husband and his family (quite important in this case) and a divorce from her former self. To come to terms with all this, she goes to Greece, to a small island, where she went with her husband many years ago for their honeymoon. Not a damn clever choice if you ask me!She has many profound discussions with herself and with the local doctor when she is hospitalised after an accident. These conversations and flashbacks give us the various bits of the puzzle that constitute the story of Nina. It's cleverly done.I enjoyed this book very much, but not so much due to the clever plot as to the acute description of the trials and tribulations of being a middle aged women.Disclaimer: I've known Andrea through Twitter and Facebook for quite some years and have even had the pleasure of meeting her IRL once, here in Copenhagen."}, {"userName": "Bonnie Hawker", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30532134-bonnie-hawker", "userReview": "An interesting read and just about a 'couldn't' put down.

They were inseparable growing up, even as their relationships evolved over the years. While a series of definitive events led Nina to marry Paolo, it was Luca who always seemed to be her soulmate and the only person who truly understood her, the focus of her life it seemed at times. The story actually begins years later when Nina finds herself at an all-time low point in her life, estranged from Luca and separated from Paolo, alone for the first time. She retreats to a remote Greek island where she honeymooned with Paolo 25 years before. On her vacation, Nina is struck by a bus and ends up spending several weeks in the hospital, where she develops a meaningful attachment to her doctor. During this time Nina reflects on the events of her life that have led her to her current state, coming to terms with the reality of her struggles with her family and loved ones. Nina wonders whether she's ever been truly happy. It turns out that being hit by the bus saved Nina's life.In addition to the love triangle she's always been a part of with Paolo and Luca, Nina was always a trio with her parents as well. She was always close with her mother while her father was distant and aloof, but only later, through reading her mother's journals after she passed away, did Nina learn just how much her mother truly loved her, and how this became a barrier for the love with her husband.Nina has been deceived by everyone she ever truly loved. Her mother had secrets, which Nina later discovered through the journals, and Luca betrayed her. She never really allowed herself to love Paolo, at the time believing that he was really in love with her mother all along, but finally allowed herself to open up and welcome a new view of him after detaching herself from Luca.\"The point is that you think you'll only love once, or one person at a time. Isn't always so.\"\"I find myself in the past and in the future, going from one to the other and back. I use the past to speculate forward. I'm barely in the present at all.\"\"There were other people I pushed away who stayed away, people who proved to be easily deterred. Close friends, people I'd always thought were close friends. I told myself I was happier not having to deal with people, but I wasn't happier.\"This is a story about perceptions. The events in relationships and friendships can often be interpreted vastly differently between the parties involved, leading to hurt and misunderstanding. It's also a story about the heart, and love, and whether or not we can choose to love someone.Nina lives with deep and painful regret about what her life could have been, but after her accident she is able to forgive, discover hope, and embrace her future."}, {"userName": "Malinda Lawrence", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16832004-malinda-lawrence", "userReview": "\"In some ways, hope is the worst thing; whenever there's fresh hope there's also something new to lose.\" (p. 44).\"Passion, on the other hand...there are feelings best kept in our heads, out of harm's way.

I read The White Lie that I enjoyed so much that try to keep a watch out for Andrea Gillies novels. I personally found it so very hard to close this new novel from Andrea Gillies. It seems that in The Enlightenment of Nina Findlay that Andrea has been even more dedicated to all the characters you can really relate to them all. All the scenery is so well described you can see the vision of all the places which is an added bonus to the story. Andrea has adapted a very good opening page that puts tears in your eyes. Nina is in on holiday in a tiny Greek Island where she had gone to 25 years earlier on her honeymoon. While Nina is taking in the views and taking photographs she is involved in a disastrous accident. A driver Andros is peering through his windscreen driving his minibus round the sharpest bend on the stony dirt road. The minibus was coming right at Nina. Questions were being asked Why he driving without lights? and was he driving too fast?.Nina is taken to hospital with her leg was snapped jagged between her ankle and her knee. Nina is glad that she has an English-speaking doctor to explain what has happened to her and what the doctor has had to do to her leg..Nina wanted a divorced, but her ex husbands brother who had loved her and whom she had loved.

I get that it was so back and forth because it was a story telling / full of flashbacks but the way it was done was kind of confusing. And there are so many details and parts of the story left out that you feel one way about certain characters the majority of the book and then in like the last 100 pages there's all this new unexpected information that's thrown at you and it makes you question everything you've just read / everything gets all jumbled. I get there are supposed to be plot twists and turns but this was just ridiculous. Also, the ending annoyed me. This thing that is so huge and important to the plot is revealed in the last 30ish pages and leaves you with so many unanswered questions and you have to go back and reconnect all the different points and things you just consumed.

Discussion of the word \"love\" - especially the notion there should be a different word for the love between partners, versus a parent and child - was particularly poignant and totally on the button. Gillies' prose is lyrical and deeply romantic, yet also bitterly harsh at times; I'm not sure how she's done that, but Gillies is a talented writer.

But when her sister-in-law becomes gravely ill, the triangle that Nina's depended on becomes catastrophically unstable. The life she's known begins rapidly to unravel, and odd things begin to happen which those around her insist are all in her mind. Separated from her husband, she goes on holiday to a tiny Greek island, the honeymoon island of 25 years earlier, and is involved in a serious road accident. There, while recuperating, she becomes close to her doctor, who's also on the point of divorce. A new relationship seems possible - but what's real in the situation, and what's imagined? Pressed in at all sides by other people's truths, how can Nina be sure of identifying her own? A diary that was her mother's proves to be a turning point. Perhaps romantic love is always a kind of undiagnosed madness. Face to face with the facts behind her assumptions, the time has come for Nina to unravel the taut knot of her past.", "title": "The Enlightenment of Nina Findlay", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24115323-the-enlightenment-of-nina-findlay", "average": 3.06, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1421371292l/24115323.jpg", "reviews": 45, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2953360.Andrea_Gillies", "name": "Andrea Gillies"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Literary Fiction", "Contemporary", "Relationships", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24115323-the-enlightenment-of-nina-findlay", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22889871-the-enlightenment-of-nina-findlay", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21000618-the-enlightenment-of-nina-findlay", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25483159-the-enlightenment-of-nina-findlay", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22955251-the-enlightenment-of-nina-findlay", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12388177-the-white-lie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8442497-keeper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6742108-wine-guide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6742107-gillies-guide-to-world-beers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34270172-good-beer-guide-1989"]}
