This story covers the college years of Patricia Miller Mauro as she struggles to make end meet, help her family and better her future. From a life of poverty to an abusive stepfather and drunken mother. Young Patti struggles to get through school and help her mother and younger sister. I loved the how the author describes the different situations she came across. They were very honestly portrayed. You can really get a good feel for what she went through. You can empathize with each struggle-emotionally, mentally and spiritually. From scrapping food from cafeteria leftovers, to praying for others compassion. Each trial has you yearning more and more for her success. This was a short read at only 138 pages but each chapter was filled with heart-felt moments. The writing was easy and enjoyable to follow. Once I got into the book, I could not put it down until I had finished.*Per FTC Guidelines-I received this book as a Free copy from the Goodreads First Reads. Thank you Patricia Miller Mauro for sharing your experiences and offering up a free copy of your book."}, {"userName": "Chrystal Mahan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4804161-chrystal-mahan", "userReview": "Everyone has a tale to tell, a story about the past that made them the person they are today. For some, like me, it is a horrible tale that you often wonder if it is really your life. I have spent much of my life feeling very alone. We often look to others for strength, support and sympathy. It is hard sometimes for someone who has never been through anything like you have to really understand the type of support you need. Although I hate that these are the types of things that bring people together, I have to admit I get a great sense of satisfaction from reading someone else\u2019s tale of a horrible past and making something wonderful out of their life. Reading a story such as this will make you think about all of those horrible things you only see on television or read about in the newspaper. So many times people look the other way because they do not want to think about the terrible things that are happening in their own backyard. Those who have lived through such an ordeal are glad to be survivors, but not many write a book about it.I am. And she did.Patricia Miller Mauro\u2019s Safe from the Past: A Story of Hope, Faith and Determination struck a chord inside of me. It gave me hope and I know it will give others hope as well, whether they are a survivor or not. Good people still do exist in this world.Mauro came from a poor, single parent family. She got on the right path by obtaining a job through the federal funded Summer Youth Employment Program. Most would have begged and pleaded with their parents to NOT have to work on their summers off. Instead of complaining, she was looking forward to getting food for her mother and her sister. After reading that I knew Mauro was a special woman. She made the best of every situation. Doing her job through SYEP the best she could resulted in her getting a promotion from back room clerk to Secretarial Assistant. Through the course of her life, Mauro took every change she could to build on her resume, knowing someday that was going to help her get out of this poor situation.Things went from bad to worse when her mother married Bill, the raging alcoholic who beat his wife and her children. Once Mauro was able to go to college, despite every obstacle that came her way, she never lost faith and she never quit trying. There were times throughout her college career she had no more than two pennies to her name. She prayed day and night. What would she do? She would \u201cworry about it later\u201d and keep moving forward.In college her English professor set her up with word processing training. In those days, not many were educated in that department. To her advantage, by the summer of her junior year she had landed a job at Chase Bank in New York City. Senior year landed her at Merrill Lynch. After graduation a short stop at a temp job landed her at DTC (Depository Trust Company) right in the heart of NYC\u2019s financial district for 13 years. Not too bad for a girl who grew up poor, with an addictive mother and alcoholic step father. Although there is much more to the story in terms of what happened with her sister, her mother, the step father and even her father, I can firmly say that Patricia Miller Mauro wants you to know that just because you feel helpless you still have the power to change your life. \u201cHer book is a continuation of that tribute (in regards to a published article about her mother\u2019s recovery from addiction) and serves to spread the message that good news is on its way to those considering higher education but who are afraid to dream.\u201dI feel everyone, no matter what they are going through in life can benefit from reading this book."}, {"userName": "Freda Mans-Labianca", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2967441-freda-mans-labianca", "userReview": "Now I know why some people are so strong... it's what they live through.Patricia's story is a fine example of just that. Her life made her stronger, and made her make wiser choices.I couldn't imagine being forced by my parents to attend college, and then leaving me there alone with no help. It would also force you to be resourceful, or bad things would happen. Patricia used what life experience she had to help get her through it all. In the end it was the wisest thing she did.I really enjoyed this book, maybe due to my brother's recent death I need something inspirational to pick me up. It makes me want to be stronger and keep going in my own fights I fight."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379520-kyle", "userReview": "I was a First Reads winner for this book.

ALL young adults should read this memoir so they can learn what this author has lived through because her mother, a single parent, had no college education. Today, a college education is the only way to be able to obtain any type of job to be able to support one\u2019s self, or even a family. It is vital to life today.Any young adult not wanting to obtain a college degree should know their future will be limited. Their future will not allow them the opportunities that they \u2018could\u2019 have had. They may suffer through life with jobs that don\u2019t pay enough money to be able to support themselves, much less a family, and end up having to get two jobs to make ends meet. She made this point extremely well known by telling us how her life was growing up.She knew a college degree would allow her to work in the field of her choice. This allows for enjoyment of working at a job to enjoy, and a meaningful life to be lived. Without that piece of paper, she would have been stuck working at jobs that do not allow for any of that, much less allow her to be able to provide for herself, or a family.Today, a college degree is the only way to obtaining your dreams. Usually employers ask this question first. It is required for almost every job out there, besides manual labor.Sure, the author still lived through extreme poverty while going through college, but her end dream of obtaining that piece of paper will allowed her to get away from that horrid lifestyle of extreme poverty. No longer will she rely on anyone else, now or in the future, to hold her back.Where many people would give up, even while this woman (the author) came upon \u201cmany\u201d dead ends while trying to get through college, such as not having a penny for food, she held on. She held on for dear life. Why? She was bound and determined to complete college no matter what. She refused to continue to live the life she had, living in extreme poverty. She no longer wanted to live that way. She knows life does not have to be that way and took every possible step to change her life. She knew getting a degree from college was her \u2018only\u2019 ticket to freedom from extreme poverty, and to be able to do whatever \u2018she\u2019 wanted to do in life. I highly recommend this book to our Youth of today. This book make such a point. Without college, you may have nothing. With college, you can have everything.I received this book from LitFuse Publicity by The P3 Press, through their Book Reviewers Program in exchange to read the book and write a review about the book.

Her mother was always struggling between jobs to provide for their family. Patricia\u2019s real father wasn\u2019t ever around growing up. Her mother eventually remarried and married Bill. Patricia felt she has to watch out for her sister. Bill and her mother would often drink and fight with each other. Patricia vowed to escape that life somehow and someway. Her mother always told her to follow her dream and go to college. She didn\u2019t want her to end up in poverty like she was before she met Bill. Patricia had to pay for college all by herself. She decided to attend Muskingum College.Reading Patricia Miller Mauro\u2019s book, I have seen that she had a tough life. She had to overcome a number of obstacles to achieve her dreams of a better life. She had to choose to never give up. It showed me that if she can get through college and make it, I can too! She had a number of doors that closed on her but she kept looking for that window to climb thru. If you believe you can accomplish your dreams, you can do it! It may take a lot of hard work and determination but you will get through it better than before. It can only make you stronger. Patricia was always in fear that she didn\u2019t belong in college. But she eventually saw the light and believed she could actually earn a degree.I would recommend this book to anyone who dreams of a better life and wants to accomplish your dreams. Even if the roads are rough around the edges you can do anything if you believe you can. You have to never give up on your dreams. They will be tough times but you can always come out of them stronger. This book will show you you\u2019re not alone in feeling hopeless and helpless sometimes you have to stand on your own two feet. Because really you aren\u2019t alone someone else has faced what you\u2019re going through and they survived. They made their dreams become reality.\u201cI received this book for free from Litfuse Publicity Group for this review\u201d."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2291555-donna", "userReview": "\"If you are ever afraid of doing something because you don't think you can do it, think of this: if it's a true and noble desire in your heart, and you do everything in your power to achieve the unachievable, people will stop and take notice. In a lot of cases, they will even help you. But you must have hope; you must have faith and you must have determination. The rest is magic.\" pg. xviTo say that Patricia Mauro had a difficult, bitter road to travel is an understatement. There was poverty and food stamps, a step-father who promised security, but that hope went out the window with nightly drunken fights, and the road to college that was anything but easy. But, through it all, Patricia kept her mother's words, \"You don't want to end up like me,\" in mind. Through it all, she kept planning to bring her mother and sister into financial freedom with her. The bright spot in this book is that she continually worked hard and became a conqueror.I enjoyed the candor Ms. Mauro used to write this book. It couldn't have been easy to live her life, much less write about it, but her hope and inspiration kept me turning the pages. If you are looking for a book to help you be strong or to gather hope; if you need to help someone else with problems and struggles, this book will help. It is a story I won't forget.

It was a quick, though not easy, read, that can be finished in an afternoon.The story is set up in an interesting style, the years flying by swiftly, sometimes to a fault. We see the author\u2019s domestic problems, the terrible ways she and her sister managed to survive through years of alcoholic parents. The way that Ms. Mauro manages to find strength in her mother\u2019s words to forge ahead on her plan to attend college is wonderful to read. Not many of us would have that will to make things work for us. The book would have benefitted from a slower pace, from a more detailed description of her school years, to give us a better sense of the way her life improve or didn\u2019t. We are left wondering. The writing itself could have been better. There are quite a few run-on sentences, and other uncomfortable grammatical structures. There are a number of clich\u00e9s repeated over and over, which is a fault in which many of inspirational books fall. It is not horribly painful to read, but many times it had me skipping paragraphs to avoid a gag. All in all, I do recommend it, mainly because it is someone\u2019s life and these kind of experiences do benefit everyone who reads them.

It was a quick read (or would have been if I weren't already reading other books), inspiring, and just plain good. Only a couple of things bothered me, one being the author's repeating of her hardships. A lot. I do understand that her life was pretty horrible, but she repeated herself almost every chapter. Maybe it's because my childhood & parents weren't that great either, or maybe because I live in Memphis and am surrounded by that kinda stuff, but it seemed over exaggerated at times. The other thing that kinda bothered me was that Patti thought that a college degree would solve all the problems in her life. But the last few chapters cleared that up anyway. Oh, and I would have liked there to be more about her personal life. It read as mostly just facts, but the friends she made in college, memories and stories from childhood, that kind of thing would have been really interesting to read about as well. This was a sweet, inspiring book about a woman trying to make a better life for herself, and succeeding in a pretty heart warming way. :)If you'd like to hear more of my babblings, please visit my blog, Veni, Vidi, Legi"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2521894-laura", "userReview": "Title: SAFE FROM THE PASTAuthor: Patricia Miller MauroPublisher: P3 PressSeptember 2010ISBN: 978-1-933651-84-2Genre: Self-helpPatricia Miller Mauro\u2019s parents divorced when she was very young, and she was forced to go hungry when food stamps ran out.

Patti was glad to leave home for college, but she worried about her sister and about how to pay for college. SAFE FROM THE PAST is a remarkable story of courage and pluck. Patti had the courage to take her life by the horns and to do what it takes to survive. I don\u2019t know of many in her situations that would do what she did.

Safe from the Past is an inspiring story about hard word and determination. Patricia Miller Mauro just shows that no matter what your past, you can do anything you dream of. You can either follow the path of self pity or overcome obstacles and find success. In order to build a future however, you have to overcome your past. I like how she awknowledged her past, learned from it, and refused to follow in the same foot prints as her mother, and was able to overcome every obstacle to achieve her dream. This book is a very quick read, and the only complaint I have about it, is that it could have been a tad more personal. I would have liked to have read more stories of her childhood in order to truly understand how horrible it was, as well as her struggle in school being penniless and almost forced to leave.
