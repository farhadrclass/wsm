The plot twists are just...very cool. And (this is the one great thing about losing your ability to retain information) that ending still managed to surprise the hell out of me.And if you haven't read this one yet, it'll shock the shit out of you, too.I promise.Original Review 2012I was skeptical of the Calvin and Hobbes artwork that started this volume off, but eventually it worked for me. Blending innocent art with the sinister going-ons in the plot definitely brought it up a notch.Again, this was excellent. Excellent! I can't even...And the ending? What?! How could you do that to me, Joe?! Gah!

Ty got smarter (as one ideally does during the course of adolescence and after some rough experiences) and Kinsey got dumber (as one probably does after artificially removing parts of one's mind with a magic key).

I have the day off work and am blissfully binging on the terrifying thrills and spectacular adventure that is Joe Hill's Locke & Key series. I'm madly in love with this wicked crazy gothic modern fairytale about a sprawling, mysterious house with forbidden secrets hiding behind locked doors and a cast of unusual keys with the power to open them. This story works not just on a fantastical level that blows all the circuits of your imagination at once, but on an emotional level where you care and worry about the characters and grip the pages white-knuckled in total abject fear for their safety. Little Bode Locke stole my heart from the opening pages of  Welcome to Lovecraft and I've come to adore the sweet, precocious brat even more as the series has gone on, gathering steam and momentum and magic along the way. Tyler and Kinsey are great older siblings acting as stabilizing forces to Bode's youthful uncontainable exuberance and transgressions. But even Tyler and Kinsey have made mistakes that have put the entire family in the worst jeopardy. Where do we go from here? What happens next?What is the Omega Key? And what lies behind the black door?Eeek! 2012 review:Outstanding!!!! I cannot wait for more! This series continues to get stronger with every installment.

The first chapter has a nod to Calvin and Hobbs it appears. The art is great and it can also be gorey. In this book, ever chapter has a new key that does something. It still feels like Zack is always ahead of everything and he's going to win. Yet, Bode seems to be catching on. There was a huge cliff hanger at the end. I mean I need to find out what is going to happen. Just like with other volumes, characters die, it looks like the Locke children might get ahead and it seems that Zack is ahead.

He targets an old girlfriend of Rendell\u2019s (the Locke kids\u2019 dead dad) who recognises him, and he continues to torment Rufus, the son of the woman he\u2019s living with. Then it\u2019s a waiting game until something resembling a plot emerges in the final act. It\u2019s not really plot-driven - it\u2019s not really character-driven either! Locke & Key\u2019s \u201cstory\u201d just kinda\u2026 floats there. Maybe this is a detail I\u2019ve forgotten from previous books, but I don\u2019t get why Zack - if he can change his sex on a whim - doesn\u2019t adopt a different face from the one he\u2019s worn for decades? You know, the one that attracts unwanted attention and damningly appears in old photos? Or why he even has a lip-ring, an easily identifiable marker? Surely everything would be easier for him if these two things were gone altogether? Amid the waiting around, there\u2019s some clumsy social commentary on the double standard in society for whites and blacks, and some corny melodrama with Tyler\u2019s girlfriend Jordan - the kinda crap that doesn\u2019t happen outside of bad fiction. Joe Hill\u2019s also just not very good at pulling off real emotions. One scene has Tyler suddenly sobbing about his dead dad that comes out of nowhere and is unexpectedly funny! Gabriel Rodriguez\u2019s art is fine. There\u2019s a cute Bill Watterson tribute in the first chapter where Bode becomes a sparrow, and I liked the Jester Key design. Generally his art is good. But, wow, what a lot of filler! A whole heckuva lot of watching the characters putz about doing nothing for page after page! I guess the fans of this series must really like the Locke kids for them to think this book is all that and a bag of chips? Not me. I was bored for much of it and only mildly interested once Hill decides to start doing things in the final 20 pages or so. I have the whole series so I\u2019ll finish the remaining two books but this fourth volume is slow and uneventful for the most part - a tedious read that feels like Hill and Rodriguez milking their cash cow for as long as possible."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "The series just gets better and better. In  Keys to the Kingdom  I feel the need to remark on the daring use of unconventional storytelling and experimental graphic settings. The opening issue,  Sparrow is a particularly well executed homage to my all time favorite artist Bill Waterson and his newspaper style of small panel stories. The choice of Bode as a stand-in for the subversive Calvin is obvious to anyone familiar with the personalities of the Locke children. Here\u2019s a gem from the mouth of the adventurous kid: @#&%!Teenagers!What the heck is wrong with them?!Just when you\u2019re about to get a good snowball fight going, they have to ruin it by talking about \u2018relationships\u2019! Left to his own devices by his teenage siblings, Bode discovers yet another magical key, one the opens to him the kingdom of beasts. An amazing flight of fancy that ends in blood and tears as the Adversary of the Locke family is still plotting to bring them down.In the next issue,  White  Kinsey and Bode investigate the past mysteries of their father\u2019s generation, with the help of another magical key, one that allows a person to change his/her appearance. The premise offers good material for an exploration of racial prejudice and identity issues.Issue no. 3,  February , is built on a calendar template, with each panel representing a day in the winter month. We have Tyler trying to fit in on his school\u2019s hockey team, Bode discovering new and dangerous keys, a little highschool romance drama with Kinsey playing the rebelious girl and hesitating between the dark and hansome Zack and her geeky class mates while Tyler wins and loses his girlfriend attentions in the space of a few days. I\u2019m starting to lose track of all the new keys and abilities among creeping sharp vines, rusty chains, mesmerizing mechanical dancers, sword wielding squirells and strength enhancing amulets. The three Locke scions find out among other things that playing around with magic and bringing their friends in on the secret can have unforeseen and painful consquences. Casualties  is using a classical comic template, I believe from the 1970\u2019s, from some military themes series that I\u2019m unfamiliar with. Bode is assisted here by the boy Rufus, and together they discover that their make-believe game of toy soldiers is mirroring the larger conflict between the Locke family and their Adversary. The autistic Rufus has his own magical abilities of perceiving the supernatural manifestation in the mansion, among them the ghost of Sam Lesser, still haunting the halls and corridors looking for revenge against the Adversary. Detectives , parts I and II, bring about a timely and surprising major development in the plot, so I will talk less about them. Suffice to say, I felt it was about time for some revelations and a game changer from the interesting but repetitive experiments with new keys.Overall, the quality of the writing and the graphical excellence show no signs of faltering after four albums, and I have high hopes from the following albums."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15797955-leah", "userReview": "From 5 stars to 4.

And there in lies the problem - how do I differentiate between the volumes when so far the are all so good.So there is the challenge how do I (or more likely fail to) pick out aspects of one book to the next which makes this review any different to the volumes either side of it.Well what can I say. the series is now past the half way point and as you would know from the earlier volumes the story is now heading towards its confrontations and conclusions and in Keys to the Kingdom we start to see the major shifts in the storyline start including a massive shift at the end of the book ( remember no spoilers).

The fourth volume \u201cLocke and Key: Keys to the Kingdom\u201d is an Eisner nominated book by Joe Hill that proves to be the huge turning point for this series as Zack Wells, who turns out to be Lucas Don Caravaggio in a new body, starts showing his true colors! \u201cLocke and Key: Keys to the Kingdom\u201d is a brilliant volume that will definitely turn the tides for this series!There are a total of five chapters in this volume and here are the chapters:\nChapter One: Sparrow:\nIn this chapter, Joe Hill makes a tribute to Bill Watterson\u2019s famous comic strip \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d by detailing a story where Bode tries to make new friends but there appears to be a key that can turn anyone into a wolf and Zack happens to obtain the key to transform himself into a wolf and attack Tyler and Kinsey! Meanwhile, Bode is able to transform himself into a bird and has crazy adventures in his bird form!\nChapter Two: White\nWhen an elderly woman named Erin Voss started acting crazy every time she is near something white, Kinsey encounters the subject of racism, while she is curious about how Erin Voss knows about her father Rendell. So to approach Erin Voss, Kinsey finds a key that allows her to change the color of her skin. But what secrets is Erin Voss hiding?\nChapter Three: February\nDuring this month, the Locke kids go through so many supernatural activities where they are attacked by various monsters. Meanwhile, the kids try to tell their friends about the keys, but they end up facing the consequences of their actions.\nChapter Four: Casualties\nWhen Rufus, Coach Whedon\u2019s son is visited by the ghost of Sam Lesser, he finds out that Zack Wells is not all he is cracked up to be and Rufus must find a way to warn the Locke kids about Zack.\nChapter Five: Detectives\nWhen Tyler discovers something foul about Zack Wells, he goes to find out more about Zack Wells and his connection with the murders in the town. Unfortunately, Tyler will soon realize that Zack might be up to some sinister tricks that could endanger his family!Oh my goodness! Did I mention before that this series just keeps getting better and better every time I read them? The fourth volume in the \u201cLocke and Key\u201d series is definitely no exception to this as it serves to be a huge turning point for our favorite Locke kids! Joe Hill has once again done an excellent job at balancing the supernatural nature of this story with the everyday problems that the Locke kids have to face after the death of their father. I loved the way that Joe Hill portrayed the relationships between Tyler, Kinsey and Bode as they all care about each other and it was great seeing them protect each other from any danger that comes towards them. I also loved seeing the relationships that the Locke kids have with their friends, especially Kinsey with Jamal and Scot as they are extremely close with each other and I loved the dialogues that Joe Hill sets up between the three of them as they are extremely funny and thought-provoking to read. I also loved the tension that Joe Hill builds up with Zack Wells as it seems that his true nature is beginning the show in the most terrifying way possible (there was one scene where Zack seems to do something to a person that made me really cringe \u2013 you have to read it for yourself!) Gabriel Rodriguez\u2019s artwork is as always truly dramatic and gorgeous to look at as all the coloring is dark which fits the gloomy feel of this story and I loved the way that the characters look semi-realistic which really gives the story a more mature feel. I also loved the way that Gabriel Rodriguez was able to portray the Locke kids as characters from \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d in the first chapter \u201cSparrow\u201d and the artwork in that chapter truly portrayed the spirit and humor that came from the \u201cCalvin and Hobbes\u201d comics.As with the majority of the \u201cLocke and Key\u201d series, this volume has extremely strong language and many violent and disturbing scenes that would cause anyone who is not used to gory images to feel uncomfortable. I have mentioned before that there was a little scene where Zack does something horrible to another character and it might disturb many readers (it definitely disturbed me a bit, although the artwork was fantastic for that scene). Overall, \u201cLocke and Key: Keys to the Kingdom\u201d is a brilliant volume that really turns this series to a new direction and I cannot wait to see what will become of the Locke kids at this point! Now, I am definitely excited for the fifth volume \u201cClockworks!\u201dReview is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon", "userReview": "What more can I say that I haven't already said about this series? I've been singing its praises for the past 3 volumes and with this 4th installment, it shows no signs of slowing down.Rodriguez really shows off in this collection. He clearly isn't satisfied in sticking with the artwork that has made this such a great story. He takes a bit of a risk within the first chapter and transistions to a style similar to Calvin & Hobbes, which despite the darker subject matter, still works.While more than a few things happen in this volume, the story never seems cluttered and nothing feels unnecessary. The introduction of 3 more keys lead to several twists and turns as well as some pretty awesome scenes. Probably the biggest twist in the story happens near the end of this book causing me to salivate for the next release.I'm hoping that when this comes to an end (a sad day, indeed), they decide to group this into one massive trade. As of yet, there are no weak points or bad developments. In my experience, it's rare that a 4th volume is just as strong as the first. It takes a great duo (writer & artist) to pull this off.

While this comic overall was dark, the \"Calvin and Hobbes\" sections were filled with the wit that made the latter so loveable."}, {"userName": "Edward Lorn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn", "userReview": "2.5 stars rounded up because ice-skate violence is the best violence.At this point I was really hoping to find out more about the keys but instead I'm beginning to feel like I'm watching a television show that doesn't know how or when it wants to wrap things up. (Can you say The Walking Dead, class? The. Walk. Ing. Dead. Good job, class. Soda pops and arsenic tablets for everyone!) Every time they need a filler issue we're introduced to a new key and BOOM! just like that we have more story, or something that resembles story progression, anyway... yay...whoohoo...FML... This volume was all over the place in the most haphazard ways. Pure chaos. No rhyme or reason beyond needing to tie up some loose ends. Thing is, these loose ends could've been tied up in a single issue. Instead of that we're given an entire season of filler. Ladies and gentlegerms, meet Scooby Doo's baby-daddy's cousin Whoopity Doo!The first issue in this volume was radical, with the birds and dogs and shit, and then everything went to hell in a flaming sewage truck. It wrapped up with a silly-as-fuck ending, but at least that ice-skate scene exists. Still, I closed the book thinking, \"Come on! How much longer are they going to prolong this ending???\" The art is still good, as is the dialogue and the writing, but the story is moving along at a snail's pace. In summation: Really thought I would like this series more than I do at the moment, which blows because Volume 3 was so goddamn good. Not sure what happened here, but I hope Volume 5 drags the story back onto the rails and we can finally progress with the story instead of filling in the blanks in the most chaotic fashion imaginable.Final Judgment: Make like a herpes-ridden cock and WRAP IT UP!"}, {"userName": "Javier Mu\u00f1oz", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47879363-javier-mu-oz", "userReview": "La cosa empieza a ponerse seria, como siempre Joe hill consigue atraparnos con la vida cotidiana de los hermanos Locke al tiempo que va avanzando en la historia principal poco a poco, dejando semillas de tramas que m\u00e1s tarde se explorar\u00e1n o recuperando otras que se dejaron a medias. La forma de manejar los tiempos narrativos de Joe Hill me parece excelente, no se cae como en otras colecciones en la tentaci\u00f3n de meter episodios de relleno... todos los episodios avanzan la trama principal aunque sea s\u00f3lo un poco, todos los episodios muestran aunque sea peque\u00f1os detalles en la progresi\u00f3n de los personajes principales, los episodios individuales funcionan bien por s\u00ed s\u00f3los y al mismo tiempo se integran en la trama de una manera perfecta, as\u00ed como los distintos vol\u00famenes, muy bien pensados para que se puedan disfrutar tanto en conjunto como por separado.... esto hay guionistas de comics que no lo consiguen en toda su carrera y Joe Hill hace que parezca sencillo.En este volumen hay un personaje que simplemente muere, otros que est\u00e1n a punto, otro que aunque no muere se convierte en esp\u00edritu y otro que aunque muere est\u00e1 m\u00e1s vivo que nunca, llaves nuevas que se nos presentan sin demasiada ceremonia, Sam Lesser volver\u00e1 a intentar jug\u00e1rsela a Caravaggio/Zack/dama del pozo, Kinsey demuestra que no hay que jugar con ella, giros argumentales y sorpresas por doquier y acabaremos con un cliffhanger que nos dejar\u00e1 con ganas de empezar el siguiente volumen seg\u00fan acabemos este.

Perfection. Give me the next volume in my hands now! Or somebody get a hurting... I kid. Or am I...Uh yeah, pretty much my favourite series. Only thing wrong with it is that it only has 6 volumes and I need more in my life. I am almost done, with the fifth just coming in the mail now, and that makes me a very, very sad panda."}], "description": "Joe Hill and Gabriel Rodriguez's Locke & Key unwinds into its fourth volume in Keys to the Kingdom.
