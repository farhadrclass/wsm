It is also part of the Arcadia Valley Romance series and is a wonderful warm read.Meeting up with familiar characters meant I felt right at home. People bond over food and there were some deliciously tempting moments.God is at the centre of lives. He longs to hear from us. Sometimes life is confusing and we have no words to say. We are \"trying to find the words to pray, thankful... that the Holy Spirit knew her [our] heart.\"At times there are no words, but we can turn our worship into prayer. \"Worship music... when she needed to pray but couldn't find the words.\"People and family are important. We need to have correct priorities and not be job focused and money driven. \"Take your time to sit on the porch and enjoy the people you love.\" We need to make time for the things that really matter.Life is not always easy but \"God doesn't promise us easy. He promises to walk beside us.\"We need to take care of the earth's resources. The Arcadia Valley series concentrates on local sustainability and is all for reducing the carbon footprint.Love hurts. Sometimes we wall up our heart but we need to begin to live again by trusting others and letting them in to our lives.The novel deals with divorce, infertility, adoption and premature birth. We never know what life will throw at us. We need God and good friends and family to get us through.I adore Elizabeth Maddrey's books. They are full of warmth, life lessons and relationships with God. Her books always leave me smiling and I cannot wait for her next book to tempt me. More please Elizabeth Maddrey.I received this book for free. A favourable review was not required and all views expressed are my own."}, {"userName": "Beth Erin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40899796-beth-erin", "userReview": "Full review on Faithfully BookishI am a big fan of family-centered\u00a0series and the Baxter family has earned a special place in my reader heart! In this third and final installment, readers are treated to a storyline involving all the Baxter siblings and a couple of unexpected secondary\u00a0characters as well.Jonah Baxter has thus far been the epitome of patiently impatient in love. Jonah isn't perfect and he honestly makes some boneheaded mistakes but he's faithful, loyal, and has a heart of gold.Gloria Sinclair has a secret and it's pretty huge. When her past unexpectedly impacts her present, the quiet life and relationships she has spent years\u00a0building are suddenly strained. This series is one yummy romance after another and I highly recommend it! Although this series is part of the larger Arcadia Valley Romance collection, it can be read and enjoyed apart from the other series as well.I received a\u00a0complimentary copy of this book from\u00a0the publisher and was under no obligation to post a review. The opinions expressed are my own."}, {"userName": "Phyllis", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20954624-phyllis", "userReview": "\u201cEvery good love story starts with a certain amount of stalking.\u201dWhen Jonah decided to bring Kenia to Micah\u2019s wedding, I wanted to yell, \u201cYou can\u2019t do that!\u201d From reading the previous books in the series, I knew that Jonah and Gloria belong together. Whatever Gloria\u2019s secret was, it couldn\u2019t be so bad it would keep them apart, right? Right?As with most of this author\u2019s books, the story was a combination of humor, sweet romance and slightly uncomfortable situations that make me think about what the right thing to do is. She sprinkles Christian teachings throughout as a fine chef spices his food.Speaking of chefs, (like how I did that?) Jonah has been so fun to read about through this series. He is a talented chef and baker who loves to experiment with various flavors of donuts. He is kind and loyal, but certainly not perfect. Both he and Gloria needed to learn to be willing to talk instead of assuming things, and they both needed to learn to be vulnerable so they could be open to receiving God\u2019s best for them.I think my favorite part of the story is where Gloria was in church and realized that she had never allowed herself to fully open up to God and trust Him.There was a part of her that wondered how much she held back from God the way she tried to hold pieces of her heart back from the people she loved.I love the way Elizabeth Maddrey ties the books in her series together, and yet allows them to each stand on their own. The Baxter Family Bakery series books are all by Elizabeth Maddrey and intertwine more closely than the Arcadia Valley Romance series and so for the fullest enjoyment, I recommend you read them all.This review was originally posted on Among the ReadsI would like to thank Elizabeth Maddrey for giving me this item. My opinion and review were not influenced by this gift."}, {"userName": "Margaret Nelson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32582749-margaret-nelson", "userReview": "Elizabeth Maddrey's final work in her share of the Arcadia Valley stories is well done. I'd love to read more about the Baxter family in the future, but she does wrap up a lot of loose ends. The story will keep you on the edge of your seat, with plot twists, miscommunications, plans that go awry, and so on. I'd wondered what Gloria's secret was, and I had not guessed it ahead of time! At one spot in the story, I quit reading for the night because I knew a plot twist was coming, and didn't want to read it just before bed. Well, there was a plot twist, but it was totally different than what I expected!"}, {"userName": "Lyndon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5730242-lyndon", "userReview": "Well-rounded conclusion to the Baxter Family series (set in the shared world of Arcadia Valley - 18 books by 6 different authors, including Maddrey's trilogy). Donuts & Daydreams weaves together a nice balance inspy romance elements - misdirection, comedy of errors, competing love interest, budding romance, tension/crisis, Christian themes, and of course a happily ever after resolution. If you lean at all toward clean romance, check out not only this set of Baxter bakery novels but the whole multi-author series."}, {"userName": "Renate", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51444728-renate", "userReview": "A well crafted page turning romance with likable characters and setting, contemporary topics of premature births, infidelity, and hiding from an abusive spouse. Mouth watering bakery treats and restaurant entrees. Sad to see the Baxter Family Bakery Arcadia Valley Romances come to an end. Elizabeth Maddrey satisfactorily brings closure to her delightful bakery series. Each book can be read as a stand alone."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23009683-debbie", "userReview": "Gloria and Jonah\u2019s story is truly wonderful.
