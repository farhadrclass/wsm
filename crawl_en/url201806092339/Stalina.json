So she takes a job as a maid in the Liberty Motel, working for Mr Suri, an Indian gentleman whom she comes to admire and like. The motel is situated in Berlin, on the outskirts of Hartford, Connecticut.The \u2018motel\u2019 makes its rooms available to couples who have nowhere better to go. Payment is by the hour. Mr Suri is given to watching the clock and one of Stalina\u2019s duties is to phone the clients fifteen minutes before their time is up. Stalina takes her work seriously. Given the nod by Mr Suri, she turns her attention to interior design, turning the rooms into fantasy destinations and marketing them as \u2018rooms for the imaginative.\u2019 Some of these designs are described in detail. Though I found them unattractive the clientele make frequent repeat visits.But Mr Suri\u2019s plans for the development of the motel, together with Stalina\u2019s success in marketing the rooms, proves too much for the local mob who are also in this line of business. So they \u2018buy him out\u2019. Stalina is sad to see him go but is retained by the new owners to run the motel and makes a success of it.The story is told in the first person. It is always interesting to see how an author handles that. Some go for an educated person, a professional or academic, who can be counted upon to be as articulate as the author. A few choose someone less articulate who nonetheless has insights to offer, however eccentric their expression may be. And some have used for their narrator a person who, while telling the story in an interesting manner, also reveals a great deal about his or her character without realising it. John Galt was a master of this technique (the Scottish novelist of that name, not the fictional character in Atlas Shrugged).In this case, the issue is complicated by the fact that Stalina, though a professional, is Russian and is therefore recounting events in a foreign language. But her father, a poet, had been fond of English literature and so her knowledge of English had begun in childhood. Though reference is made to her heavy accent, it seems that over the years she has acquired an excellent command of English. The author\u2019s use of first person narrative works well. Stalina has a voice of her own, not only in the way she expresses herself but also in her attitude to life. She is always direct and businesslike. 'Life was so different at the Liberty Motel. I\u2019ll now take a moment to describe the d\u00e9cor of my room designs.' ( Page 44)'The next bit of my story will explain how my life in Berlin, Connecticut, and in the world, suddenly and completely changed.' (Page 126)Just as she is direct with the reader so she is forthright with those she has dealings with, be they friend, acquaintance, customer or foe. Her US destination was chosen because her friend Amalia had gone there before her. However, she learns that Amalia has been ripping her off by selling some of the Russian brassieres that she, Stalina, had brought with her to supplement her income. The confrontation between the two is very sharp and Amalia becomes an ex-friend. Despite this, Stalina takes Amalia\u2019s cats, Shosta and Kovich, when Amalia leaves the area. She likes animals and observes their behaviour closely.Stalina is open to life in all its variety. She is not a censorious person and accepts the wide range of behaviours she comes across at the motel much in the spirit of a human zoologist. She notes but does not deplore. For example, speaking of two of her favourite clients she says: 'I wanted to ask them why they were not together like a regular couple. They could love each other and take care of each other. The rest of the world would just have to understand.\u2019 (Page 85)At its extreme this attitude to life might be questioned, and never more so than when a woman is found hanging in one of her rooms. Stalina phones the police at once, as the reader would expect, but the police are in her pocket since some of them frequent the motel. There is no interest at all in whether the woman hanged herself or someone did it for her. Was this only because she was a known prostitute? I don\u2019t think so. \u2018We\u2019ll call this a suicide. No worries \u2013 we\u2019ll take care of the body. You can go back to work.\u2019The other officer said, \u2018No need to mention this to anyone, Ms Folskaya. We\u2019ve got your back.\u2019 (Page 189)Most people would recognise a big difference between suicide and murder but in this case no one, including Stalina, seems to care. One strand of the narrative concerns the death of the young Stalina\u2019s pet dog and the disappearance of her father to the Gulag shortly after. This is subtle and handled very well. A connected strand of the story involves Nadia, a bossy girl Stalina knew as a child. To discover many years later that this same Nadia fronts the local mob which takes over the Liberty Motel stretches credulity. How likely is it that two girls from Leningrad end up as competitors in the sex business in Berlin, Connecticut? This is an enjoyable book. Stalina comes over as a real person and one you like. I feel I have met someone new, as I would when she has spoken to me with such candour over two hundred pages.Small pointsThe book under review is \u2018an advance reader\u2019s copy, an uncorrected proof.\u2019 I can\u2019t think there is much to correct. The only sign of it I could see was this.The was is pulling up worms from the ground. (Page 87)Readers outwith the United States may be disturbed by a couple of past tenses. It seems that in the US the past tense of the verb \u2018to fit\u2019 is also \u2018fit\u2019. I have come across this many times, for example in John Irving, but still find it strange. But here I also find \u2018spit\u2019 used as a past tense despite the fact that the verb \u2018to spit\u2019 is an irregular verb where the root vowel changes in the past. I can\u2019t help wondering if this past tense is common in the States while hoping that it isn\u2019t."}, {"userName": "Daphne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3837312-daphne", "userReview": "There are many delightful moments in this odd and entertaining novel.\tNamed after the man whose many victims include her own father, Stalina Folskaya embodies the ambiguity of so many Soviet citizens toward their country and its communist past; her mother named her for the leader she both \u201cworshipped and feared\u201d out of reverence as well as protection\u2014necessary for a Jew in Russia. And so at the start of this quirky novel, Stalina, like so many Russian Jews in the early 90\u2019s, leaves her country for the United States, where she makes a modest yet happy career for herself at the Liberty Motel, a by-the-hour place outside of New Haven, Connecticut.\tDespite this surely seedy setting and a plot that involves the Russian mafia, the story and its narrator remain obdurately jolly; even with the many sad stories in our narrator\u2019s past, we sense that no one will come to real harm. But that is part of the charm of this joyful book, which, though it at times tends toward farce, embraces the many bizarre and sorrowful truths in this world.\tSetting the tragic absurdities of Stalina\u2019s life in Soviet Russia against the peculiarities of the capitalist USA allows the author\u2019s great sense of humor to shine. (For instance, stepping out of Kennedy Airport upon arrival, Stalina is disconcerted to immediately hear Russian being spoken\u2014by the taxi and limo drivers waiting for their fares.) Stalina is admirably good-natured\u2014self-confident, outgoing, mischievous\u2014and her observations are spot on: \u201cEverything is potentially a drama. I noticed that holidays here always coincide with sales in stores. In Russia we have parades.\u201d\tStalina embraces her new life in \u201cConnecticut, USA\u201d whole-heartedly and with optimism, finding the world a curious and amusing place. Her spunk and resourcefulness make up for a storyline that relies a bit much on coincidence, and while the book could use some editorial shaping, what it lacks in plot structure it makes up for in wackiness, including a stray cat raised by a crow, revenge via crematory ashes, and a crime boss whose dream \u201cis to have Berlin, Connecticut become the short-stay capital of the East Coast.\u201d \tThere were many moments where I laughed out loud and many moments where I thought, That is so true. The author respects the often harrowing histories of her Russian characters and, most importantly, is true to human nature, to our weaknesses and superstitions, to the strengths and frailties of our friendships, and to the baggage of the past that we bring with us no matter where we go. As Stalina proudly says of the various betrayals, both horrible and petty, that motivate much of the action in this novel, \u201cIt was all very Russian.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2291692-heather", "userReview": "I have to admit that the first thing that led me to select this novel was the fact that much of it takes place in Connecticut. Not too many books are set in this location and as that is where I was born and raised I have an affinity for good old CT. I also have read very, very little on Russia, so I was interested in that setting as well. The story shifts back and forth between Stalina in the present, 1990\u2019s-2000\u2019s, in Connecticut to her past in Russia. I also loved that it was set in a \u201cshort stay\u201d motel \u2013 mostly for the cast of characters that would come through the establishment and the crazy things that happened to them.Through the shifts back to her past in Russia we get to see some of what it was like to live in Stalinist Russia. We also get to see what effect that early life has on characters that immigrated to the United States. Stalina comes into contact with several friends from her homeland while in the States \u2013 which initially felt a little far-fetched, but I guess it is possible.The story is told in the first person with Stalina talking to the reader. She tells it like it is and doesn\u2019t mince her words. Through the prose you get the feel that this is being told by an individual whose first language is not English, which adds to the believability of the story and the character of Stalina.This was certainly not a heavy read and was more of a fun romp. It isn\u2019t very plot driven, mostly centering around characterization. It focuses primarily on the motel that she is working at with the historical thrown in here and there \u2013 but that is not to say that I did not learn anything, like this tidbit:\u201cHe was holding up his right hand showing a mangled index finger. In his youth it was common for young men to chop off their trigger fingers or shoot wax into their leg veins to make them varicose to escape serving in the czar\u2019s army\u201d (pg 31)All in all a quick and enjoyable read. You could likely devour this in one sitting.This book was received for review from the Amazon Vine Program - I was not compensated for my opinions and the above is my honest review."}, {"userName": "Anya", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2215821-anya", "userReview": "I was intrigued to read Stalina because in the free kindle sample I found out that she (the main character and the narrator) came to the USA in 1991 \u2013 a year before I arrived here, and her mother was born in 1935 \u2013 which would make her just a year younger than my mother is. I realized that it\u2019s not a memoir, but fiction, and yet, I was looking forward to finding similarities to my former live in the USSR and my mother\u2019s many memories. I was disappointed by many cultural inaccuracies strewn around the heroine\u2019s recollections. For example, when describing the \u201ctourist breakfast,\u201d Rubin said it was made of reeking fish, when in fact it was cooked from meat and tasted something like the American spam; cooking with rosemary there was not heard of, etc. These seemingly small inaccuracies and the absence of hardly any references to her pre-departure years (surely Stalina was not asleep through Gorbachev\u2019s years filled with changes), make this immigrant tale unauthentic to someone like I. The fact that Stalina was supposedly fluent in English even before arriving in the NYC because her father read to her in English forty some years prior to that, is completely ludicrous, which did not add to the feeling of plausibility either. The heroine comes across as one-dimensional and curiously immature for her age. Even the ending is totally unremarkable and flat."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2696085-barb", "userReview": "Just OK.

I would have liked a bit more about her reasons for leaving, especially as she left an elderly, demented mother behind in St Petersburg. However, we meet her as she is preparing to leave and so assume those thought processes are behind her. Arriving at Kennedy Airport, she makes her way to Hartford, Connecticut, where she stays with her childhood friend, Amalia. As is all too common in the emigre experience, her chemist's qualifications are of no value in her new land so Amalia finds her work as a maid at a local 'short-stay' motel. Stalina settles into this new way of life and persuades the proprietor to allow her to decorate some 'theme' rooms. Her Gazebo room and Roller Coaster room are an instant hit and The Liberty Motel adds 'Rooms for the Imaginative' to its motel board. Strangely, though she thinks about decorating other rooms, nothing happens for several years. Unfortunately, I thought the novel collapsed in on itself at this point (about 2/3 through). Suddenly the motel ownership changed, 'suits' were on the scene, and Stalina breaks up with her closest friend over a thieving incident. I don't want to spoil the story for prospective readers so I can't fully explain why I lost patience with the book at this stage, but all these events occurred with no build-up or back-ground and my star rating plummeted from a good 4 stars to only three. A love interest in America would have been good too. There were some really nice touches too though, particularly the relationship between Svetlana, the kitten, and Zarzamora, the crow. The flash-backs to Stalina's life in Russia were also interesting and the episode with the ashes made me smile.

Stalina leaves behind her elderly, alzhimeric, mother and her past. As a trained chemist, Stalina is quickly disillusioned about her bright future prospects and becomes a maid at a short-stay motel.Stalina convinces her boss to let her design some of the fantasy rooms and business skyrockets.\u201cStalina\u201d by Emily Rubin is a well written novel, but I had varied thoughts about it. While the story was certainly interesting the book had very little in the way of plot and no ending.The characters were certainly well developed. Stalina is very engaging, her circle of friends was interesting and her circle of acquaintances was also intriguing. Ms. Rubin certainly knows how to build a scene and explore relationships. The father/daughter relationship which Stalina relishes thought the novel is heartwarming and sad. Stalina\u2019s father, a poet, was taken by the Russian government never to be seen again.As someone who had to learn English as a second language, the notion that Stalina spoke fluent, or even passable English because her father read to her in that language was a bit of a stretch. There are plenty of people who hear English everyday (via songs, radio, TV, movies, etc.) yet cannot converse. I can watch Telemundo all day long yet still not be able to hold my own in Spanish. Learning a language takes dedication, time and practice.As appealing as the character of Stalina was and as interesting as her point of view is I still felt as if the book was a collection of short stories all revolving around a central character.Certainly not a bad thing.Please visit my bookish blog at http://www.ManOfLaBook.com"}, {"userName": "Yolo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2827387-yolo", "userReview": "My feelings for this novel are mixed. On one hand it\u2019s a well written book but on the other hand it\u2019s not quite there for me. It was as if the book had no plot or rather no climax.I did enjoy reading the narrator\u2019s description of Russia post Soviet Union. However, I wasn\u2019t sure if the details were facts.For the most part the characters were well-developed and the author did a good job of painting a visual picture of the scenes. I also enjoyed exploring the relationships of the characters. My favorite character was Stalina\u2019s mother. Her mother liked to curse and y\u2019all know I like people who curse\u2026 Shhhhh! I also enjoyed reading about her father\u2019s love for American literature. I think it was her me wanting to know more about her father at-times that kept me interested.On the other hand, I didn\u2019t like some of the criticisms the narrator made about America. I\u2019m one of those people who believe in the mantra, \u201cLove it or Leave!\u201d I\u2019m okay with comparing differences between America and Russia but I caught myself telling the narrator, \u201cLeave then!\u201d Maybe it\u2019s the American in me.So for the most part this a well told story but I just felt like it was missing something.

A shorter book, means you can read it before that Russian ethos overwhelms. I found it hard to relate to Stalina or the other characters, but I liked the author's descriptive style, the subtle plotting of the story line ( this is a creeping plot but works in a short book). The setting of short stay hotels in Connecticut really made this story much more interesting. The plot is mostly set in mid-1990's Connecticut with flashbacks to various scenes in Stalina's life growing up under Stalin and his successors -- the flashbacks are just the right balance. The best scenes in the book involved Svetlana the Kitten and the crow feeding her. This is certainly a more cerebral and literary read than one packed with adventure and there are many chuckles amid the heavy Stalinist feeling in the book. See what happens with Stalina's mothers' \"revenge\" for one such scene, and some of the short stay guests as well.
