That is what I found in this quirky \u201ccozy mystery\u201d from renowned author Rene Gutteridge. It tells the story of a woman named Jules whose life is something akin to that of a recluse following the tragic death of her law enforcement husband. Instead of keeping in touch with her friends and family, Jules spends her days reading and blogging about said books with an occasional routine trip to the grocery store. When a normal trip to the market leads Jules to meet her favorite author, things get sketchy when the next thing she knows, Jules wakes up in a unfamiliar surroundings with a captor. Very unusual to her routine, Jules disappearance leads her concerned father to reach out to his son-in-law\u2019s former partner, Chris to find and return his daughter safely. Whoever nominated this book in the 2014 INSPYs, you deserve a shout-out. That nomination ensured I actually read this \u2013 and I\u2019ll admit that while it did sound fun, it wasn\u2019t a book I was prioritizing \u2013 but boy, am I glad I did. Anyone going into this expecting the tradition of Dani Pettrey or Lynette Eason will be disappointed. This novel is a simpler mystery that\u2019s more \u201ccozy\u201d than breath-catching. It\u2019s not so much the adrenaline rush as it is a \u201cneed\u201d to continue reading in order to piece together the puzzle (a mental stimulation) of why Jules in in the predicament she is \u2013 and more importantly, what point her kidnapper is trying to make. Because of this the story may read \u201cslower\u201d than the average mystery, but let me tell you, I was riveted. This is one of those books I didn\u2019t want to see end and rarely, if ever, came across as ill-timed or poorly plotted. If you like mysteries that don't use the same ideals or are comfortable being \"stuck\" in a formulas, check this one out. It's quite memorable and contrary to what you might think, I can assure you, the topic has nothing to do with my positive review. I promise. *wink* Thanks to the publisher for a copy of this novel in contemplation for the 2014 INSPYs."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5862081-jessica", "userReview": "The story as a whole was good. I really enjoyed how the book shifted to right after the kidnapping so that the reader was on the same footing as the characters in trying to figure out what had happened. I liked the fact that the bad guy wasn't a homicidal maniac. Sometimes those are fun books, but the characters in them are often so unrealistic it's difficult to feel invested in the story. This book wasn't about what new tortures the bad guy could think up, but rather what was going on in his marginally-sane mind. The main woman character seemed realistic as well, balancing trying to do and say what she thinks her kidnapper wants and erupting in frustration. She was braver than I in some of her outbursts.I've never read a Christian suspense/mystery book and wasn't expecting it. I felt most of the Christian aspects were forced. Some seemed natural, like a widow wondering if her husband would still be alive if she had prayed for him. Almost every other time when religion was brought in, it seemed out of place in that the conversations and the religious doubts the characters had are nothing like those of real nonbelievers. This issue even extended to word choice: I have never in my life heard a nonbeliever refer to God as \"the Creator\" or \"the One\".The book lost some of its appeal at the end. Suddenly, events become stereotypical and unrealistic, with near deaths every other page. Characters who have been severely wounded are running around like they only sprained a wrist. What was a long dangerous road to navigate while in perfect health is suddenly no problem for someone gravely wounded and repeatedly almost passing out.Finally, unrelated to the content of the book at all, I really loved the cover.

I read Misery Loves Company in one sitting. Page after page I turned into the early morning hours. In my opinion, a book that causes me to keep turning the pages, until there are no pages left to turn, is exceptional and quite excellent.I found a lot of similarities between me and Jules, more than I would have ever imagined. It was as if someone had been watching me and wrote a store based on me and my life, that is how similar the character of Jules was to me and my own real life. Truly amazing!In addition to Jules, I also felt a deep compassion for Patrick. Patrick and Jules are two people I did not want to depart from or say \u201cGoodbye\u201d to when the last page was reached.Within these pages are people who may not have truly known God and the peace that He gives. However, they learn to give in and cry out to God. By doing so they see His grace, power, and peace envelope them and their situation.It has been such a long time since I have read fiction. I usually gravitate towards the non-fiction titles. However, this time I am so happy that I made the choice to step into the fictitious world which Rene Gutteridge has made with Misery Loves Company.

The first novel I read by her was Ghost Writer which was about an author receiving anonymous pages by someone writing in great detail about his life. I love those things that have some insight into the writing world and putting twists on them is great fun.Misery Loves Company is Misery (by Stephen King) in reverse and I wonder if the title is a play on that book's title!You should stop reading now as this review might contain spoilers. A book reviewer suddenly pops up missing. Involved in her disappearance is a well-known author. Just why he's taken her becomes the real crux of the mystery. Does he have information on why her police husband was killed in the line of duty?I really did like this book but some things kept me from loving it. The villain was just never consistent vacillating between fatherly and mentally ill. It really felt like he was more misguided than evil especially when his goal for taking her seems to be to pass the baton of his writing career to another and he was never punished for his crimes at the end of the book.

Terrify me.Filled with grief, Jules Belleno rarely leaves the house since her husband Jason\u2019s death while on duty as a police officer. Other than the reviews Jules writes on her blog, she has little contact with the outside world.But one day when she ventures out to the local grocery store, Jules bumps into a fellow customer . . . and recognizes him as her favorite author, Patrick Reagan. Jules gushes and thoroughly embarrasses herself before Regan graciously talks with her.And that\u2019s the last thing she remembers\u2014until she wakes up in a strange room with a splitting headache. She\u2019s been kidnapped. And what she discovers will change everything she believed about her husband\u2019s death . . . her career . . . and her faith.Misery Loves Company by Rene Gutteridge was an excellent novel that was incredibly deep and realistic and left me almost literally gasping for breath as I reached its end and clawed my way out its storyline. As I sit down to write this review, it is an odd feeling because writing book reviews is what Jules in this novel does every day, and it is partly because of this activity that she finds herself in a hidden cabin, kidnapped by her favorite author, Patrick Reagan. An odd feeling indeed. Aside from that, I found Misery Loves Company to be a wonderful read that had a perfect mix of suspense, mystery, murder, revelation, and truth seeking. The plot line was spectacular, and I highly enjoyed the interactions between Patrick and Jules as Patrick taught the Jules the undercurrents of what lies within a true author and his novel, and Jules discovered the truth about Patrick, her husband, and what real faith in God is. The narration of the novel alternated between the perspective of Chris, Jules' husband's best friend and partner on the police force, who is bending every rule to try to find Jules and figure out how Jason died, and the perspective of Jules as she tries to understand what Patrick wants from her and why he has taken her captive. Both perspectives were necessary to the plot line of the novel, and they kept the reader informed about what was happening at the cabin and out in the rest of the world during the investigation to find Jules. The characters of Misery Loves Company were engaging, realistic, and well developed. I was surprised by the secrets that Patrick held, and I was enthralled as he demonstrated the art of writing to Jules and as he shared his deepest scars and troubles with her. Jules started out as a depressed, lonely, and shy young woman who had lost everything and had no faith, but as the novel progressed, she began to understand the truth about herself, her husband, and her Heavenly Father. Jules' father also experienced change throughout the story as he realized the effect that his lack of relationship with and his alcoholism had had on his daughter. Chris had his own journey of faith and finding the truth as he sought to find Jules and to understand the God that Jason had always talked about. Chris did not have nearly as much overall development as Jules and Patrick did, which I thought took away from his personality slightly, but I did understand that it would have been hard to have the two character scenarios completely balance as one was more central to the overall plot. As a whole, however, I was blown away by the intricate storyline, realistic characters, and important topics that this novel contained. This novel was a wonderful mix of some of my favorite ingredients, and the final concoction was spectacular. I would highly recommend this novel to any reader that likes a suspenseful thriller that digs way beyond the surface of a normal thriller into the raw emotions and gritty details of real life. I look forward to reading more of Rene Gutteridge's novels.

Terrify me. That\u2019s Jules\u2019 advice in her review of her favorite author\u2019s latest novel. After a successful writing career, Patrick Reagan\u2019s last three books don\u2019t live up to par, in Jules\u2019 opinion. After the death of her husband, Juliet Belleno lives in seclusion. Her life is scheduled and structured down to the last minute. Her only interactions are through her blog where she writes her reviews, social media, and her father\u2019s visits.Suddenly, Jules wakes up and is held in a locked bedroom in a cabin in the mountains. She looks up to read a scary, yet familiar message written on the ceiling. The last thing she remembers is her weekly Tuesday trip to the grocery store where she excitedly ran into Patrick Reagan. Where is she and who has taken her from her home? Chris Downey promised Jason Belleno to watch after his wife if anything should happen to him a few weeks before he was killed in the line of duty. However for the most part, Chris has left Jules alone. She made it clear that she prefers her solitude. When Marine Lt. Colonel, Juliet\u2019s father, approaches him to tell him that Juliet is missing, he feels personally responsible. There is no sign of struggle in her home, and the captain of police thinks that Jules left on her own accord and isn\u2019t offering him any help. Secretly investigating Jules\u2019 disappearance, he finds out interesting information on Patrick Reagan. The more he digs the larger the situation becomes, and it\u2019s not clear who can be trusted. \tI realize that it\u2019s very ironic right now that I\u2019m writing an online book review about a woman who writes online book reviews. I promise that this is my honest opinion, even if I will be looking over my shoulder for the next couple of days. If I had to describe this book in one word, I think I would pick \u201ccomplex\u201d. I love stories that have such a complex structure, that you are sucked in and feel like you are experiencing the same situations as the characters. The relationships are multidimensional; there is so much history with them. They are realistic in that there are ups and downs with every single relationship. Their personalities clash, but they still like or love each other. Sometimes, you just have to learn to exist with them to keep the peace. Since they are so realistically developed, I can relate to them. It\u2019s like going to Thanksgiving at Grandma\u2019s house every year.The spirituality of the story is very subtle. Yes, there are talks of God and how he reveals himself, but it didn\u2019t come off as preachy at all. I think each character has a genuine motivation to engage in the acts that they do. Many times we aren\u2019t sure what the motivation, as it\u2019s to be revealed with the mystery, but the reader is sure that there is a reason why someone is acting like they do. There is no generic explanation for the motivations and I could tell they were carefully created and worked into the plot and history of the story. If you\u2019re a reader who enjoys plot twists and surprise revelations, you\u2019re going to like this book. There were plenty of times where I was genuinely shocked when a piece of the puzzle clicked in to place. It drives the story right up to the major resolution and made for an engaging, fast paced read."}, {"userName": "Deanna Gottreu", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5365853-deanna-gottreu", "userReview": "Misery Loves Company by Rene Gutteridge is a very intense story that grabbed my attention on the first page and with each following chapter the story became even more intense. Jules Belleno lives in seclusion since the death of her policeman husband and spends her time writing book reviews on her blog and posting comments on FaceBook. She only leaves her home to make short trips to the grocery store. On one fateful day when she is at the grocery store, she meets her favorite author and that is the last thing that she remembers. Jules wakes up in a strange bedroom and sees written on the ceiling the exact words that she used in a review of a book written by her favorite author, Patrick Reagan. She realizes that she has been kidnapped by Patrick and everything that happens in the days that follow causes Jules to question her husband\u2019s death, to question her life in general, and to even question her faith in God. Colonel Jim Franklin, Jules\u2019 father, and Chris Downey, her husband\u2019s best friend and fellow policeman, are the only two individuals that take her disappearance seriously. Chris even goes against authority in his search for Jules and as a result he uncovers things that endanger his own life as well as the life of Jules.The author did a very good job of keeping the reader hanging on every word and wondering what was going to happen next. The characters were extremely well developed to the point that I could feel Jules\u2019 pain and almost feel sympathy for her alcoholic father. During the entire time that Jules was in the cabin with Patrick, I felt as if I were right there in the room with them for the author did an excellent job of portraying the emotions of both characters. There were many twists and turns in the plot line and just when I thought I had everything figured out the author would surprise me. As all the action was taking place in the last half of the book, I could feel the tension in the air and the danger lurking behind every corner. The author\u2019s description of all the scenes were very realistically done and while reading I could picture everything in my mind and see and feel exactly what was happening. I wish that the author had written exactly how Jules was kidnapped rather than just writing that she was at the grocery store talking with Patrick Reagan and that was the last thing she remembered. But I am sure the author had a reason for not elaborating on the kidnapping. I really like the way that the author kept God foremost in Jules\u2019 life and how she was able to influence others.I highly recommend this book to anyone who like a very suspenseful Christian novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what is going to happen next.For anyone interested in information about the author visit this Tyndale site or check out the author\u2019s webpage.Tyndale House Publishers provided me with a complimentary copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

Everything is safe and quiet, until one moment she wakes up from a foggy stupor to find herself kidnapped and held captive by the last person she ever thought to even meet \u2013 her favorite author. The connection? Her negative book review she'd posted on his latest book only that morning.Pros: There are authors who write well and then there are authors who's writing fills every crack and cranny and grants your mind the knowledge that you are left in the hands of an expert craftsman. Such is Rene Gutteridge. I was already a believer in the talent that Rene Gutteridge has shown so effectively through her previous works and in Misery Loves Company, that talent is once again showcased in brilliant form. I found the synopsis of the story, being kidnapped by an author following a negative review, to be a truly unique story and one that I found myself engaging with, being as how I'm a book review blogger myself. Cons: I found there were times where Misery Loves Company began to drag (perhaps that \u201cChapter 17 syndrome?\u201d) but even in this I feel inadequate to give this negative opinion, seeing as how due to my schedule, I was reading most of this books a few pages at a time over a period of a week or more. Any story read in small segments can begin to feel dragged out, especially for me, seeing as how I usually finish a book within 48 hours of starting it. So perhaps it was just me losing the flow of reading that I'm used to? Either way, I did begin to feel somewhere in the middle that circles were being made and nothing was being revealed or developed for the climax. The ending was a little different than I had imagined it would be, but I think that was the exact goal of the author. I had expected more \u201cdrama,\u201d more danger and perhaps, a bit more of an intense ending that we got. I mean, being kidnapped by your favorite author and being held captive by him alone in a remote location is just ripe for all kinds of deliciously frightening story sequence, right? With a catch phrase of \u201cDon't tell me it's terrifying. Terrify me\u201d used throughout the book, I was rather expecting just that \u2013 to be terrified. But I wasn't and I don't think that, at the end of it all, that was the intent.

She hasn\u2019t been quite herself since her husband Jason\u2019s murder and it is reflected in her writing. One day, she is shopping for groceries and bumps into Reagan; then everything goes black. She wakes up in a stranger\u2019s house and realises that she has been kidnapped. Her captor is no other than Patrick Reagan, her favourite author. He claims that he is keeping her there because he wants to give her a \u201cwriting lesson\u201d of sorts and believes that, after reading her less than pleasant review of his latest book, she needs to learn more about him and why he writes the way he does. Meanwhile, back in Jules\u2019 small town, her alcoholic father reports her missing and her late husband\u2019s partner, Chris, begins an investigation which leads to some very surprising and tragic discoveries. This is quite an unusual book - I would say that the best way to describe it would be \u201cCastle\u201d meets \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d. It is obvious that the author is a big fan of \u201cCastle\u201d - the murder mystery subplot felt like it was written by Andrew Marlowe - the writer of the show. However, the book is primarily to remind us of the beauty and miracle of writing. Gutteridge uses religious undertones in order to show the parallels between God and a writer. She says that the reason writers \u201cplay God\u201d is because sometimes, the only way to escape, to show that you care about someone and that it gets better for that someone is to write; the writers usually work things out for the good of main character. Clearly, some of Gutteridge\u2019s favourite works is where the protagonist has accomplished more than they thought they ever could. I just loved the way she talks about it, and the line about the main character \u201ccontinuing on into the white space of literature\u201d and living there happily ever after has really gotten to me and made me think about how many times all of us just dreamt of being a character in a book. Perhaps, subconsciously, one of the reasons we want that is literary security, i.e. knowledge that we shall live forever, on the pages of a literary masterpiece. In my opinion, this book is a must-read for most writers and bloggers, particularly if you like detectives and mystery novels. Although Juliet\u2019s character development could have used a bit more work, I really liked Patrick\u2019s journey and development and I feel that it makes up for the rest of the characters which are rather two-dimensional compared to him. My rating is 7.5/10"}, {"userName": "Bluerose's  Heart", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3723392-bluerose-s-heart", "userReview": "This is now the 3rd book of Gutteridge's that I've read, and they've all been very(very) different from each other. (Of course, 2 of them were co-authored, with 2 different authors, so I'm sure that made some difference.) Either way, I think it's safe to say I'm now officially a fan of hers, especially since I've been on the hunt for more of her works.Misery Loves Company is one of those books that you need to go into, like me, without any clue what will happen. Just let the story unfold as you go! I'm not even going to put a description anywhere in my \"review\", because I sincerely believe that's the best way to go with this story.Misery Loves Company is a story that has really made me think. After closing the page, I didn't leave the story behind. It's made me think about the way I read books, what kind of books I read, my blogging, my reviews, and social media, in general. In many ways, it was a wake up call for me, which I need regularly. (sadly) I'm not eloquent with my words, and I don't always have to right words to describe my thoughts and feelings, but reading this book has challenged me to try harder. (even if there was a moment or two when I wanted to shut down my blog and hide in shame) Really, there are multiple layers within the pages of this book. There's the story itself, but so much more underneath. It's a unique read in the world of Christian fiction! I know without a description all that probably makes no sense, but maybe that will make you curious enough to give it a try. ;)Just a few things to note. This is NOT a romance. It is a bit suspenseful at times, and a bit mysterious, yet it wasn't too much for me(and I'm a wimp). There was one point I thought I was going to have to put the book down, because of my tendency to get scared and have nightmares. I was too far invested, though, and kept reading. I'm glad I did!The only negative I'm left with is concerning one of the main characters. I'm still a little confused, maybe just undecided, concerning him. There were definitely some issues that needed taken care of with him, but he leaves the story in somewhat of a shadow.Overall, I greatly enjoyed this book, and I have no hesitations whatsoever recommending it to y'all! It would make an excellent book club pick, in my opinion! If I ever join one in \"real life\", I think Misery Loves Company would be my first pick!*Thanks to my local library for lending me an e-copy!"}, {"userName": "Victor Gentile", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528881-victor-gentile", "userReview": "Rene Gutteridge in her new book, \u201cMisery Loves Company\u201d published by Tyndale House Publishers introduces us to Jules Belleno.From the Back Cover: Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s terrifying. Terrify me.Filled with grief, Jules Belleno rarely leaves the house since her husband\u2019s death while on duty as a police officer. Other than the reviews Jules writes on her blog, she has little contact with the outside world.But one day when she ventures out to the local grocery store, Jules bumps into a fellow customer . . . and recognizes him as her favorite author, Patrick Reagan. Jules gushes and thoroughly embarrasses herself before Regan graciously talks with her.And that\u2019s the last thing she remembers\u2014until she wakes up in a strange room with a splitting headache. She\u2019s been kidnapped. And what she discovers will change everything she believed about her husband\u2019s death . . . her career . . . and her faith.If someone were to kick you exceptionally hard in your shin then you might have a bone bruise. The bone doesn\u2019t break or fracture but it does bruise. Now here is the interesting part, the outside skin will heal within two weeks, bone bruises take much much longer. My point is that the outside is healed but not the inside. That is the way with trauma. After a while we heal visually to others but on the inside we are walking wounded. That\u2019s the way it is with both Jules and Patrick. Jules suffered trauma from the death of her husband and Patrick has his own traumas. Jules shrinks from the outside world while Patrick resorts to kidnapping. Jules really didn\u2019t care much about life after the death of her husband but when her own life is at stake then she pushes aside her pain and feels the need to survive and live. \u201cMisery Loves Company\u201d is how you define exciting! \u201cMisery Loves Company\u201d is a thriller with all kinds of excitement and danger.

Occasionally, she walks to a grocery store. On one of these excursions, she disappears, kidnapped by her favorite author, Patrick Reagan. Apparently, Patrick hasn\u2019t been pleased with recent reviews of his books.Police Officer Chris Downey was the best friend of Jules husband, a fellow officer murdered in the line of duty. Chris\u2019s efforts to help Jules are rebuffed as she draws deeper into her shell.Egged on by Jules\u2019 alcoholic father, Chris begins searching for her after her disappearance. Slowly, he uncovers clues she may have been taken and by equally reclusive author, Patrick Reagan.During Chris\u2019 investigation, he uncovers information that there is corruption in his department. Corruption that may have directly contributed to the death of Jules\u2019 husband.While Chris continues his search, putting his own career at risk to save the wife of his best friend, Jules is also on a journey and what she discovers about her abductor will change everything she believed about her husband\u2019s death, her life, and her faith.This is one of the most exciting, keep-turning-pages books I\u2019ve read in a long time. Rene Gutteridge has written a mystery thriller that sucks you in on page one and doesn\u2019t let you go until the last sentence.The twist on Stephen King\u2019s Misery is very clever and maintained throughout the story.Ms. Gutteridge does an awesome job of making Patrick Reagan just nice enough for the Stockholm Syndrome to be believable yet creepy enough that we never quite trust him. As the story unfolds, we do develop empathy for him and what drove him to such drastic action.Beneath Jules Belleno\u2019s vulnerability is a strength of character I don\u2019t think she knew she had. It is revealed as she battles with her abductor psychologically and emotionally. She grows throughout the story, overcoming the demons that have tormented her since her husband\u2019s death.By the end of the story, all the clues the author has so cleverly planted come together in a very satisfactory ending, including final twists that are surprising but believable in the context of the story.A definite 5 star read."}, {"userName": "Jasmine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14933619-jasmine", "userReview": "An emotionally gripping suspenseful tale!OK, so what got me interested in reading this book was the title. I just loved it! I then read the summary of the story and it sounded really good so I decided to try it. And I was right, it was very good!This book grabbed my emotions in ways I can't even explain. The author takes readers on a whirlwind ride of emotional turbulence. After the death of her husband nothing is the same for Jules, the once outgoing woman becomes a near recluse and when she is kidnapped the game changes once again.All of the main characters have their own reasons for being on their emotional roller coasters. Each one harbors their own grief, guilt and fears, will the answers they find ease the burdens?The author is very adept at her craft. Reading this book was a bit like watching a movie completely surrounded by screens. The reader is so immersed in the story and it is so vivid that when the real world interrupts it takes time to adjust. I was so caught up in the story that I didn't even seem to turn the page anymore, it simply flowed on without thought to time.As a book reviewer with a blog, Misery Loves Company struck a chord since the main character, Jules, does the same. The story left me wondering what authors think when they read reviews of their books on my blog? How many authors actually read reviews on people's blogs and online retail sites? The insights into the process of writing, at least for one fictional Patrick Reagan, are fascinating! As a reader, not a writer in any way, the peek into the life and work of an author was fun and enlightening. I almost yelled \u201cWow, finally someone else!\u201d when I read the section where Patrick says he doesn't read his finished work, when it's done it's done.I am new to Rene Gutteridge's work but after reading this book I am going to remedy that ASAP. I absolutely love reading Christian Suspense and Misery Loves Company is what the genre is all about. So find a copy of Misery Loves Company, sit down, make sure you have plenty of time, and read it!(I received this book from Tyndale in exchange for my honest review.

Her favorite author is Patrick Reagan, and Jules is disappointed when his latest bestseller leaves her with an unfavorable impression. She shares the following thought with her readers: \"Don't tell me it's terrifying. Terrify me.\"When she wakes up tied to a bed with her own words scrawled across the ceiling, Jules can't believe it. Patrick Reagan has kidnapped her and intends to take her up on her challenge. Tucked away at his remote writing cabin, will the world even notice that this near-agoraphobic woman is missing?Police officer Chris Downey, former partner of Juliet's husband, is called to investigate Jules' disappearance by her father, but his alcoholism makes him a questionable source of info at best. There's no evidence that Jules did anything besides perhaps take a trip out of town. Feeling he's failed his partner by not keeping a better eye on his widow, Chris digs into matters beyond his official capacity and begins to run into strange roadblocks which only pique his curiosity further.As the days pass, Jules is trying to figure out the mind games Patrick is playing with her. Why is he asking her to critique the novel he's working on? Why does he have inside information on her husband's murder? What does the yet-unpublished debut author Blake Timble have to do with anything? The layers of plot kept me quickly turning pages to unravel the mystery.If you've followed me at my book review blog, you might know that this is not the kind of book I usually pick up. I'm not a fan of any kind of scary suspense. However, someone assured me that this story wasn't creepy, and as a reviewer myself I was highly intrigued to see the story Rene Gutteridge would weave around one of my kind, as it were. I thought it was well done! She also did a good job bringing faith into a desperate situation where neither of the main characters knew much about Jesus to start with.

I was sucked in when I saw a book blogger was the main character. Little did I know this book would rock my world.We all have either read Stephen King's Misery or seen the movie adaptation of the book. This has a similar story line, except it's brought into modern day with the popularity of book bloggers. Instead of a crazed fan kidnapping an author, you have a crazed author kidnapping a book blogger because of a review she wrote. It's kind of scary if you think about it. Granted, not that many people read my blog and I don't feel like I have a huge influence over the book community, but I could see this happening in real life. What a great story line and even more intense that it is so realistic.This is an absolute page turner (or cd changer if you listen on audio book as I did). I could not get through this book fast enough. It was one of those that even with an hour commute to and from work, it just wasn't enough. I wanted and needed more. I may have even just sat in my car to listen.... maybe.... don't judge me. You'll do the same. The tension starts shortly into the book and remains throughoutMy favorite line in the book comes from Jules' blog: \"Don\u2019t tell me it\u2019s terrifying. Terrify me.\" That's a great line for a blogger and I absolutely agree.... but I'll be paranoid to ever use it!!I give Misery Loves Company 5 out of 5 bookmarks and HIGHLY recommend it to anyone in search for a good thriller."}, {"userName": "Hayley", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19193191-hayley", "userReview": "Review copied from my blog: http://ineedthatbook.blogspot.comThis book threw me off for the first few chapters; a blogger who reviews the odd book gets kidnapped not long after posting a negative review\u2026 I really don\u2019t want any authors who read my reviews to get inspired from that little idea. So yes, I was a little thrown off but luckily I don\u2019t need to write a negative review for this book. I have tagged this book as a piece of Christian literature, mainly because a few characters in this book question their faith throughout the course of the plot leading to a few mentions of God, Jesus and Heaven. The references aren't too heavy though, I'm not a Christian myself and I didn't feel like the book was trying to preach to me which can sometimes happen when a book has characters who find faith important. I don\u2019t want to go too deep in reviewing the plot as it would be so easy to give something away, the author keeps adding little points that may or may not be important to the main plot. For example; was Jules kidnapped because of that bad review or was there something else behind the kidnapper\u2019s actions.I\u2019d like you to trust my judgement on this one rather than listen to me ramble on and on about the description and strength of the plot whilst trying not to give anything away. I gave this book a 3/5, meaning that in my opinion this book was above average but was a fair way off being my perfect read. I found some of the switching between scenes a bit unnecessary and almost distracting at times, usually I seeing the story through the eyes of different characters but sometimes the writer changed character in a way that was far from smooth leaving me feeling like maybe I\u2019d missed a paragraph out somewhere. That\u2019s not to say that the book wasn't enjoyable, it was, there were interesting concepts and as a Psychology student I do enjoy looking at how authors take on mental health. Here Gutteridge takes on grief and shows us people reacting to it in different ways, we get to see how the characters\u2019 development is affected by their mental state while still treating the matter delicately."}, {"userName": "Lindsay A.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31997073-lindsay-a", "userReview": "Wow! I've never read a book like \"Misery Loves Company\"! The setup of the story is unique in the fact that by the third chapter, one of the main characters has already been kidnapped and you know who did it, but neither she nor you has any clue as to WHY (a question that is slowly answered over the course of the story). The mixture of omniscience and ignorance was unique and very engaging, to say the least.One line that comes up often in the book is: \"Don't tell me it's terrifying. Terrify me.\" and Rene Gutteridge did an incredible job of that! As I read the book, in abject fear and absolutely creeped out at times, I found myself comparing it to an M. Night Shyamalan movie: a psychological thriller in which there's not necessarily anything obviously scary happening \"visually\", but you're still terrified out of your mind. I don't ever gravitate towards horror or really scary books, but I was very captivated by \"Misery Loves Company\" and I enjoyed the thrilling read.I hesitate to go too much into the storyline, because there are so many twists and turns, with curveballs that just make your head spin. Additionally, there are layers upon layers in this story, like one of those Russian dolls, where you keep unearthing more and more to the plot, and I'd hate to give anything away beyond the simple synopsis you'd find under the \"Book Description\" on this website. (I will say, if you're a writer or aspire to be one, you'd learn a lot from the way in which this one is written and the literary styles that are described even in the plot.)I'm giving \"Misery Loves Company\" 5 stars because it lives up to and surpasses what it promises and does what every good book is supposed to do: transport you to another world in which you're so immersed, reality and fiction are blurred, and as a bonus, teaches you a few things along the way. :)"}, {"userName": "Kate (The Shelf Life)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3616293-kate-the-shelf-life", "userReview": "Misery Loves Company by Rene Gutteridge did not go where I thought it would go! After readying the synopsis, I thought, OK, I have an idea. Nope, I was wrong. The story kept me guessing, then when I got comfortable in the story, there was a little shift and moved it another way. I loved that! Even with my horrible habit of reading the last page or two right after I start reading, I couldn't figure it out.The two main elements of this book were well done. Writing and criminal investigation. I love both and they were portrayed very well. The first half of the book focused more on the writing aspect, while the last half focused on the criminal investigation. It was a good balance.The characters in the book were developed well. Jules Belleno, you just want to reach through the book and give her a hug. She deals with the biggest fear any first responder, or military family hopes they never have to go through, a loved one killed in the line of duty. She turns her grief inward and becomes almost reclusive. There are times in the story, you can feel the pain of loss. She is so set on order and predictability and she finds out that routine, is not the safest thing as an adult when someone wants you.Patrick Reagan, he is a very complicated character, it is interesting to dig into his life through the eyes of Jules. What he wants from Jules is not what you think. He is complicated and in his mind, he knows what he is doing, and he does it well.The twists and turns of the story kept me hooked and had me up late trying to see what all happened.I will say one small thing about the cover, I'm not a huge fan of \"book art\", but it is very fitting for the this book.
