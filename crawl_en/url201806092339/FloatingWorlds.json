It said \u2018If you don\u2019t like the mafia, why don\u2019t you join it and change it from the inside.\u2019 At the time, I felt like the election had forced people into a binary decision with no acceptable option, and this meme captured that feeling pithily. What is the rational response of someone who feels this way? How were defeated Spanish anarchists to feel about the second world war? What was a M\u00e9lenchon supporter supposed to do when LePen ran against Macron? And were Sanders supporters supposed to swallow their crushed faith in the system and support Hillary, throw a Trump grenade into the system or push for a doomed third way?This book puts its main character, Paula Mendoza, in this situation, and her reactions are an eloquent exposition of the anarchist ethos. If you get stuck on the mercenary, politically-incorrect way Paula uses sex to get what she needs, like several reviewers of this book, then you miss the author\u2019s larger point. That point (I imagine) is that you lose your identity and relevance when you cede your individual agency - An important message now when people seem keen to identify with groups of every kind.The book\u2019s political sophistication is deceptively subtle, and the story is so well crafted and executed that elements forming its moral subtext often seem like incidental window-dressing.Another neglected gem the Gollanscz SF Masterworks series has resurrected."}, {"userName": "Fx Smeets", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3577268-fx-smeets", "userReview": "Cecilia Holland is not a science-fiction writer. Any person familiar with the genre will notice her lack of grasp on some of the fan's favorite science-fiction features, mainly the scientific and the gadget sides. The novel use of paraphernalia is ridiculously poor and stamps it irremediably from the seventies: if we were to believe Holland, videophones and air buses would be the only technical innovations humanity could come up with in almost 2,000 years !This aside, Floating World is a powerful evocation of the female condition - one that makes the best possible use of a utopic / dystopic Solar system. All planets from Venus to Uranus have been populated. In the most remote ones lives a mutated human population, organized in a male-based, extremely hierarchic, fascist society. This society happens to control the biggest source of energy of all the Solar system. This is not the only feature reminiscent of a Saudi Arabia-like civilization : in Uranus too polygamy is a men-only privilege, in Uranus too their wives have to go veiled in public.Paula Mendoza is a small black woman who grew up on Earth. There, like on any other planet of the Solar system, humanity lives in bubbles. Pollution has rendered the atmosphere unlivable to human beings. Under the massive globes of glass covering London or what is left of New York, Earth's society evolved to a form of pacifist egalitarian anarchy : people are poor, social bounds are loose, passions are low, life has little prospect to offer other than one of chilled-out, low-key survival.But Paula is ambitious. She wants wealth. And where to find it other than in Uranus ?The shock between the small, black, anarchist, ambitious, incredibly resilient Earth woman and the big, sur-human, machist, fascist leaders of Uranus echoes throughout the 630 pages of the novel with a strength that never weakens. Ten pages from the end I found myself still entrapped into the action and unable to guess what the final situation would be. The only reason why I wouldn't give this book the 5 stars it deserves in so many aspects is the writing itself: dry, quick, factual, unemotional, it misses opportunities to develop landscapes promising to be stunning -the quick glances we get at the outer planets, at the cities of Uranus, made me long for more ; their dark, monochrome beauty deserves to be put in pictures, in a form or another-. However, regardless of how much my romantic French soul suffered from poetry starvation, I can see how the dryness of the style serves to reflect the harshness of Paula's condition. The novel covers most of her adult life: kidnapped, beaten, \"harem-ed\", enslaved, raped, constantly despised, hated, bullied, she earns every single atom of respect she gets the hardest way. Paula's survival through constant struggle is her victory - the victory of the resilience of the oppressed, of men over merciless gods, of Anarchy over dictatorship."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1012597-paul", "userReview": "Amazing! This deserves its reputation as a lost classic. Written in the style of the late 70s socially conscious scifi epics (leguin, russ, delany, et al), this tells the story of a women from a largely ruined but wholly anarchist earth who, in her effort to negotiate a truce with a race of imperialistic aliens, the Styths, of human-ancestry, bears the children of one of their leaders and integrates into their society. All of the other humans who live with the styths do so as their slaves, so Floating Worlds becomes a sort of view of the other by the other, all wrapped up in an epic interplanetary drama. This book rules."}, {"userName": "E.J.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1080606-e-j", "userReview": "There was a recent article about the top ten best unknown SCI-FI titles of all time and this was one of them. Having never heard of Floating Worlds or its author, Cecilia Holland, I decided to give it a read, not knowing it's a modestly large book at 600+ pages. The novel is set 2,000 years in the future in which colonies are spread throughout our galaxy and earth has been reduced to a few people living inside domes because they've destroyed the enviornment outside. One woman, an Anarchist (one of the ruling parties) decides to meet with the violent race of the outer planets because she speaks the langauge. She ends up having sex and having a child with one of their great warriors and takes a position in his clan to help outline a treaty for their mineral ore. Like Ursula Le Guin's material, Floating Worlds is elusive in plot, but heavy in alien atmosphere. The alien world and their culture comes across well-thoughtout and fully realized. But I only care so much about atmosphere. Like many readers my age, I want a little plot with my novels. Unfortunately, that's what I get with Floating Worlds, very little plot. The story spends the bulk of its time following one woman as she trapes around the galaxy, playing politics with all involved. She's cunning and shrewed and makes for an interesting character, but by definition her being an \"anarchist\" means she has no personal stakes in anything, so her random actions never have any grounding or reason. In the end, I didn't really care for her or her plight becuase of this. Holland can clearly write and was probably on the forefront of the sci-fi genre in 1976 when this book was completed. She certainly was one of the first to have such detailed sexual activity in her genre book. Overall, the story was mildly interesting, but there's only so long you can go without caring about any of hte characters before you tune out. That was 2/3rds of the way through the book for me. Kudos for imagination and atmosphere, but without better plotting or characters, it's easy to see why this one is relatively unknown."}, {"userName": "Ruby  Tombstone [With A Vengeance]", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5973086-ruby-tombstone-with-a-vengeance", "userReview": "It has been two months since I first started the book, and three days since I finished it, and I am still trying to figure out what just happened. I can only tell you three things about this book...Floating Worlds has a very detailed and well thought out futuristic universe, complete with technology, political systems and alien races. Of course, being written in the mid-70s, it feels all a little dated - not just in terms of technology, but in socio-political terms as well. You get the impression that this vision is very clear in the mind of the writer though.You never know what the characters are thinking, feeling or planning. The author tells us what happens, but not why, what it means or how anyone feels about it. Perhaps this is because the author wrote historical novels, this being her only science-fiction novel. There are facts, just the facts and nothing but the facts. In a way, this almost works. It provides a blank canvas from which you can draw your own conclusions. The problem is that I doubt this was an intentional literary device. By the end of the book, I still didn't know why the main character embarked on this adventure to begin with.There is a lot of raw material for deep and thoughtful analysis about cross-cultural issues here. The central character is a female bi-racial human being amid a world of giant black-skinned, male-dominated, physically aggressive, fascist aliens. She gets pushed, punched, kicked, raped and called \"the n word\". A LOT. She also chooses to live this way, and due to the writing style, we will never know why she chose this life. It's an infuriating missed opportunity.Was it unique? Yes.Was it intriguing? Yes (but ultimately unresolved).Was it well written? No.Did it go anywhere? No.I'm just...... so confused."}, {"userName": "Iain", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7127461-iain", "userReview": "What a book! 600-odd pages covering the life and turbulent times of a woman of the distant future. It's the single SF work by a well-known historical novelist, so as a seasoned SF reader I kept a wary eye open to see what kind of book it would really turn out to be. And I couldn't crack the code. It's something of a historical mashup, sure\u2014Viking raiding parties, bloody tribal rituals, Yakuza families (hence \"floating worlds\"), backstabbing in the senate\u2014but no single element dominates, and the sum is pure gritty SF.The protagonist, Paula Mendoza, is a woman of few advantages living in a crapsack solar system of squabbling petty empires. She's smart and creative; surrounded by people motivated by hatred, fear, or lust for power, she yearns for happiness in some vague sense she can never define. She kicks against the restraints of society, takes risks, has sex with all the wrong people, is ruthless when she needs to be and loving at unexpected moments. After some absolutely horrific experiences, she's weary but undefeated. She's like a cat who refuses either to come in or go out, but insists on sitting in the doorway. She doesn't necessarily leave the solar system a better place. I didn't find this exactly a pleasurable read, but definitely compelling.The writing is stripped-down, unadorned. There's no direct explanation of the future history, and lots of names and places get flung about with little emphasis. The overall effect is of intense reality\u2014it's up to you whether to pay attention, or just let it wash over you. And time passes unexpectedly. Without any big leaps in the storyline, we suddenly realise to our surprise that a character has aged ten years. When did that happen? It's been happening all along, in small steps, no special emphasis. This is as good and rounded a portrait of a complete life as I've seen in SF.Holland has been compared to Ursula Le Guin and Joanna Russ. I also find her reminiscent of early Vonda McIntyre; like McIntyre, she doesn't necessarily give you a vivid feel for vast gulfs of time between then and now, but she does get the texture of the future right\u2014centuries of layered history and tradition, drifting far away from our own.Why only 4 stars? I didn't quite love it, perhaps because it's so relentlessly downbeat.

At the time, sex in SF was practically non-existent, so this book was exciting for its explicit sexuality. However, rather than being a feminist approach, I found the cultural aspects more reactionary. It seemed to me that the heroine was bowled over by the warrior culture's \"manly\" approach to sex and so succumbed to the alien's dominance and was willing to be limited and circumscribed by his culture just so she could get really good sex.As a feminist myself, I say \"Faugh!\""}, {"userName": "F.R.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1309606-f-r", "userReview": "I liked the amusing opening idea that anarchists would have their own committee to make sure that the anarchy didn\u2019t get out of control.

For me, it struggled to get going, was overly long and petered out with an ending that left you wondering why you bothered. Don't get me wrong, it certainly had it's moments. Most of the time I was fairly gripped, wanted to find out what would happen, where it was going. And for a while, I thought I knew, until the ending let me down. The dialogue took some getting used to too, always at cross purposes, talking past each other.Paula Mendoza was an interesting, complex character who was full of contradictions. She is both an idealist and a pragmatist, dispassionate yet often guided by her passions. She is rigid in her ideals as an anarchist, feminist and pacifist yet chooses to live in a rigidly hegemonic, patriarchal and imperialistic society in order to pursue her nebulous ends. At one point she is violently raped and yet is mystifyingly quick to forgive (something that a male author certainly could not have gotten away with).The low rating for this book belies the fact that there is much of interest in here.

Sadly, it's about as readable as the Worm Ouroborus. Leaving aside the style and aversion to using proper nouns, it's incredibly frustrating to read because it jumps around so much. There is no exposition, repeat, no exposition. There are no periods where the characters discuss their options, or even work out where they are and what they're doing there. It's simply assumed that you know how this world works, and no attempt is made to explain it to you.That's great on one level, because it's exciting and they're moving and everyone seems very decisive and intelligent.

Ugh. Phew. That was gigantic. I need someone to talk about it with. Agh. I need someone to digest that all with! Are there essays about this book? There should be.So much! So much is happening! I picked this one up for a bunch of reasons. It's a Strong Female Protagonist (weak Monty Python yey). It's social/political sci-fi, similar to (and loved by, apparently?) Ursula Le Guin and Kim Stanley Robinson, two authors I greatly admire. It's a \"lost classic\", which is always appealing (pretty obscure; hipsterfood).And just, wow. I feel a little emotionally exhausted. The story is set in the Medium-Far Future, where the solar system is way different from how it is today. Most of the planets are colonized, and radically different. Mars is a consumerist-Fascist dystopia that kinda felt like a creepy Miami/Malibu to me - or like Mars from Total Recall. Earth is a giant anarchist commune, and also an eco-disaster (so people live in domes). The moon is a theocratic dictator state. And Uranus, Saturn and Pluto have this kinda Mongolian, kinda old-fashioned hill tribe thing going on, where the people there - \"Styths\" - have mutated/evolved due to Unexplained Future History stuff. They now live in interesting-sounding domes, and are a Mighty and Warlike Race blah blah. Also, they have claws. They're basically Klingons. Am I the only one who saw them as Klingons? The hiro-protagonist of the story is Paula Mendoza, this tough-as-nails lady from Earth. Paula starts the story unemployed and dating this mansplainy jerk named Tony (TONY! *fist shake*), but then - through bizarre and interesting anarchist-commune labor-rotation stuff - gets a job with the Committee - the commune's semi-somewhat government stand-in thing. Which is, incidentally, run by extremely Machiavellian types! Paula is tasked with drafting an interplanetary treaty between the Styths and Martians, who hate each other. Wow, responsibility. But I guess that's how anarchists swing? Anyway, because she read that one paper by Paul Krugman, she writes an awesome treaty leveraging cool trade stuff. She also gets impregnated by one of the Klingons, and decides to go live in Stythsville for, like, ten years.A war happens at one point. Shit gets really intense. Work camps, despair. I despaired. Spoiler? Whatever.The book definitely carries very strong Le Guin and Kim Stanley Robinson vibes. It's Le Guin-ish during the whole Styth Living section; where we have the outsider visiting a far-off planetary culture that resembles a mash-up of Earth cultures (the Styths are apparently based on Genghis Khan et al.?) and is all about anthropology and development economics and racism. It's Robinson-ish because every character is SO. DAMN. POLITICAL. To the point of feeling just cruel, dude. Also, like Robinson, Cecila Holland (the author) kills people off pretty mercilessly. Overall, it was gigantic, and I generally loved it. It's definitely a missing classic, since the scope is vast and I could pick apart the feminist themes forever. (Like, dude, Paula is a super-independent anarchist lady who spends 75% of the book under the heel - sometimes literally! - of her \u00fcber macho Genghis Khan husband.) The writing style is also brilliant, in that it's completely spare, journalistic, telegraphic. There is NO exposition, and very little feeling. This is especially awesome when something very strange and alien is being described; Holland lets you fill in the blanks. Space flight was described with a vividness I've never seen in sci-fi, film or book. And the flights over Uranus were psychadelic, mind-bending. It was kinda like a very trippy Hilary Mantel at times (and Hilary Mantel is already pretty trippy - imagine it in a gas giant!). I loved (and was disturbed by) the moments when Holland opened up her already weird universe to a potential even freakier: the allusions to civilizations beyond this solar system; or the ambitious Styth, Tanuojin, and his freaky healer hands. What! Some stuff I loved less: despite it being like 90% awesome, I did find a couple things tedious. The characters, as written by Holland, were ambiguous, complex, weird creatures who behaved unexpectedly. Cool. BUT! It felt like some of her secondary characters were very briefly sketched out, and mostly caricatures. I especially wasn't into the fat-shamey portrayals of one prominent Committee politician, and one of Klingon Dude's other wives. Seriously, stop describing the rolls of fat and how appallingly fat these two women were. It's getting old. I also spotted a few other repetitive phrases, but I'll live. Despite these relatively minor flaws, it is a pretty brutal, mind-opening epic, and should rightly sit aside Frank Herbert's Dune and the like."}, {"userName": "Mira", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5352133-mira", "userReview": "I'm my own worst enemy.

I had no clue what was going on a lot of the time. There is a lot of political rambling. There's a lot of unexplained stuff about a special kind of alien that doesn't add a lot to the overall journey.

Of course, the writing style is completely the opposite, very matter-of-fact and even terse, but still good. I think the main personalities were well-developed and Paula was an interesting if infuriating heroine. I also appreciated that Holland spent a lot of time treating the social and political environment of her imagined future and not too much on invented gadgets (which is the reason I usually don't enjoy space travel SF). However, what still bothers me is that Holland managed to create this intricate and very dramatic plot in a future galaxy while barely explaining that galaxy. Right from the beginning, the cover says it's set 4,000 years in the future, but the starting date is 1852, and she never writes anything to account for the new enumeration of the years. The gas planets, inhabited by a mutant people called the Styth, are a fascist male-supremacist society which keeps human slaves - and even though Paula comes to Neptune as a human woman, I didn't feel that there was enough about the lives of the actual Styth women. While Holland wrote in much detail about the males' physical appearance, social rituals, peculiar prejudices, and personal bonds; about the women she only gives that they're dependent on the men and must be veiled to go out in public. Styth men can have multiple wives, but it's not clear whether it's normal for all the wives and children to live together or not. Furthermore it's a polygamist society but the morals surrounding relationships are almost as strict as if it were monogamist - one of Saba's wives seems jealous of his affairs, and they look down on Paula for living as Saba's lover without a formal marriage. I would've liked more explanation of that. Also, some things just plain didn't make sense - the Styth somehow mutated to have intensely pigmented skin from being on planets that got significantly less sunlight than Earth? Evidently Holland is primarily a writer of historical fiction, so I suppose she's used to readers having a frame of reference for the events of her book. It would seem she assumed this same frame of reference for her invented world despite the impossibility, leading to many baffling references. In the end, I thought it was a good story, but there were significant chunks of it that I didn't understand."}, {"userName": "Nigel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5020684-nigel", "userReview": "This is a rough and at times even grating read. There's a female protagonist that makes no concessions to likeability. There's a solar system populated by hedonists, fascists and people so committed to anarchy that operating without laws is a point of pride as well as principle. Then at the far edge of the system there are the mutated humans, the Styths: violent, misogynistic, racist slavers out to build an empire. Paula Mendoza is an anarchist from a badly polluted Earth. Anarchists seem to thrive on badly polluted Earth - their individualism means that communal cleanliness is haphazard at best, so personal slovenliness is represented by global environmental collapse on the macro level - basically why should anyone bother to clean up if they don't have to and there's nothing in it for them?) Nonetheless her hard-nosed pragmatism and personal recklessness cause her to become the one link between the Styth and the inner worlds. Despite their obvious flaws, the Styth are curiously attractive. They're intelligent and driven and energetic even as they' re murderous pirates and slavers - basically a Mongol horde. She builds a life for herself in their Floating Worlds while maintaining a treaty that keeps trade and peace viable, but inner world xenophobia and Styth ambition mean that conflict is inevitable.Though there is much to admire about them, the Styth are horrible and only Paula's anarchist beliefs allow her to set aside any sense of personal safety, dignity, honour, freedom and autonomy to work her way through the maze of Styth society. The rest of the societies in the solar system aren't much better despite their pretensions at civilisation, especially when it comes to dealing with the Syth. So it's hard to be sure exactly what Paula should be doing and who or what she should be trying to save, if indeed she is capable of saving anything, even herself. So a bracing read with a heroine who is uncompromising in her willingness to do anything to to achieve her goals, including survival, but who ultimately reamins true to herself in the face of devastating loss."}, {"userName": "Andreas", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7588030-andreas", "userReview": "C\u00e9cilia Holland erschafft fantasievolle Welten mit tiefgr\u00fcndigen Bewohnern.

Apathisch l\u00e4sst sie sich durch die Geschichte treiben, manipuliert die Personen in ihrem Umfeld hier und da, fast immer mit katastrophalem Ergebnis. Nur sich selbst bleibt Paula in ihrer widerborstigen Art treu. Ich habe schon lange keinen Roman mehr mit einer so unsympathischen (weil egozentrischen) und zugleich bedauernswerten (weil chancenlosen) Protagonistin gelesen. Paula Mendoza intrigiert ohne R\u00fccksicht auf andere und m\u00f6gliche Folgen. Welches Metaziel sie \u00fcber die kleinen Einzelschritte hinaus erreichen m\u00f6chte, erschlie\u00dft sich mir auch nach dem Ende dabei kein bisschen. Obwohl die Geschichte, inklusive Ausgang, ein einziges R\u00e4tsel bleibt, bin ich dennoch davon fasziniert. Vielleicht, weil die Hauptfigur ein durch und durch eigenst\u00e4ndiger Charakter ist. Dass sie Andersdenkenden und besonders M\u00e4nnern gegen\u00fcber absolut kompromisslos und verstockt (re-)agiert, nimmt der emanzipatorischen Geschichte aus heutiger Sicht etwas von ihrer \u00dcberzeugungskraft. Geschlechterkampf pur, der in seiner passiv-aggressiven Weise mittlerweile recht altbacken wirkt. In ihrer zerst\u00f6rerischen, v\u00f6llig unkonstruktiven und Ich-bezogenen Art kann die Protagonistin heute nichts mehr zur Genderdebatte beitragen. Es fehlen die gestaltenden Aspekte, die einen Wandel in der Gesellschaft vorantreiben und ein Umdenken bewirken k\u00f6nnten.

It is The Future. Earth has been devastated by pollution and radiation, and humankind on Earth live in arachistic, domed communities. Not anarchistic in the sense of chaos, but the sense of no central government. There are well-establised colonies on Mars, which is caucasion and racist, and the Moon, which is paranoid, security mad and ruled by a religious Tyrant, and the Styth now occupy the outer region of the solar system, living on Uranus mostly, and in spaceships. The Styth were human, originally, changed for deep space and cold.The Styth are an aggressive, space-pirate people, who now wish to rule the solar system by right of strength. So far, so good. I seem to remember the book has a very down-beat ending for Paula - Finally finished. I had forgotten the war, but remember the love. Just goes to show...And yes, Paula's end is downbeat. But somehow it fits.Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Jacob Barker", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40303539-jacob-barker", "userReview": "Considering this book made it into the Sci-fi Masterworks range i had high expectations. However, despite my determination to read it, I hated this book from start to finish, especially the main character. Paula seemingly had no stable character and constantly seemed to shift. The story itself was uninteresting with almost all of the characters being two dimensional, with little variation between say, the citizens of the middle planets, all portrayed as weak, rich snobs, religious zealots and xenophobic elitists. Every time an overweight bald man from mars turned up who couldn't fulfill their job description to save their life, either meekly giving in or shouting a lot, ignoring everything being said in a haze of self importance, I had to set the book down and go and read something that wasn't appalling. The book was not without it's cliches too, such as a 'prison break' scene where two characters manage not only to escape a military headquarters, but to find their way to the person in charge's office and loot it, without any sort of suspense etc. They just walked out of their cell, into the office, and then out of the building, supposedly filled with trained soldiers from a semi-militaristic society. It was good to know they were never in any sort of real danger from people like that. Basically I thought the book was poorly written and the story was awful, with a massive conglomerate of convenient cliches."}, {"userName": "Tyler", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3938670-tyler", "userReview": "Floating Worlds by Cecelia Holland - I was pleasantly surprised that I picked a book up without any prior knowledge of it, and it turned out to be a good read.It\u2019s set a couple of thousand years in the future, and much of Earth is uninhabitable due to over pollution, Mars is colonised as are the outer planets by a mutant humanoid race. The protagonist Paula Mendoza from Earth becomes a diplomat to the aggressive and dominating mutant Styth race.The best part of this novel is the fiery and unpredictable Styth race \u2013 7-8 feet tall, pitch black skin and impressive strength. The way their customs and culture differs from us is also done quite well. There\u2019s little hard science in the book; it\u2019s very much focussed on the main characters and their interactions.That said, a noticeable thing I found was that there was very little delving into the emotional state of the characters. The writing style was also unusual \u2013 many short sentences and little use of adverbs, which made the novel flow quickly but also made it seem a little cold and lacking in something, but otherwise it was an interesting story.I noticed most of the reviews are either very low or very high; I can see both points of view but would probably rate it 3.5/5; it\u2019s still a bit of an undiscovered gem and definitely above average."}, {"userName": "Caroline Mersey", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17722556-caroline-mersey", "userReview": "Floating Worlds is an interesting novel, and somewhere in there I'm sure there is a plot struggling to get out. Like the \"floating world\" school of Japanese art mentioned briefly in the novel, this book exists very much in the detail of its moments, all of which seem to exist outside any conventional sense of narrative structure. There are long tracts where nothing much happens, apart from exquisite descriptions of furniture and the feel of mud between Paula's bare toes. But then all of a sudden - and without much in the way of traditional foreshadowing - massive events fundamentally change Paula's world and life.At its heart, this is a story about three people - the anarchist Paula, who drifts through life as a detached observer, reacting to the events around her; the warrior-hero Saba, who becomes the leader his people crave; and the outsider Tanuojin, the power behind the throne who ultimately takes the limelight himself. Without any direct connection to Paula's thoughts, dreams or emotions (at most she seems to feel irritation and dislike) this is a difficult and at times quite frustrating book to read. But the beauty is in the detail. Like the metaphorical butterfly on the other side of the world, the small changes that Paula effects on the worlds around her have huge consequences."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/248667-christy", "userReview": "I see that a lot of other people liked this book, but I had to force myself to finish it. I didn't care about a single one of the characters, the plot of meandering, there was no clear narrative drive or arc, and the writing wasn't very good, either. Plus, there's a scene where a couple of desperate people eat puppies. Basically, the protagonist, Paula, gets a job she doesn't really want and gets herself into dangerous situations doing it, but before you know it she's no longer really doing that job because she's gotten pregnant by a Stythian man (a mutant from Uranus) and is going to live with him there, where she proceeds to live as a wife/slave/spy for nearly a third of the book. Finally, she gets to do more of the kind of thing she was hired to do and go back to Earth, but then fullscale war suddenly breaks out and she winds up on the run with a guy she used to work with and didn't really get along with, but now they're sleeping together (I don't know why). And then--again, suddenly--the war's over and the mutants are back. And then, and then, and then.... It's one crazy thing after another and there's no real preparation or climax to any of these things.I didn't absolutely hate the book, but there wasn't really anything redeeming about it and I definitely wouldn't recommend it."}, {"userName": "L.

Why? Because the writing is flat (Sentences that fall like lumps of lead, excess description of mundane activities), the setting of \"anarchist\" earth is uninteresting, and the protagonist is the flattest of all. Who is she, what is her background? I have no idea. She is supposed to negotiate with the Styth, a race of brutal interplanetary pirates who resemble the Klingons. They push her around, act like boors, threaten her. She never feels any emotion, although she does somehow end up in bed with one of them. (He's \"good\" in bed.) I have never felt less identification with a character. This is a top professional SF author, not an indie, and everyone gave it Rave reviews. I can only say Huh???And guess what, I decided to snoop on the last few pages. Someone correct me if I\"m wrong, but there doesn't appear to be an ending. If this is another end-less Book One, I'm taking away a star from this rating.UPDATE, I did not finish this book.

This one is a certainty. In the first few chapters it equaled many of the greats by providing an insight into a political system which I previously thought unworkable. Essentially when you read 'The disspossed' you get to the end and think 'hmm communism what a good idea, when you read 'starship troopers' you get to the end and think 'facism what a good idea.' When you read floating worlds you think 'anarchism what a good idea!' But that is just the first couple of chapters. In later chapters you get an insight into a clearly human but brutally different culture of the styths. The interplanetary politics rivals that of dune. Thrown into the mix you also have survivalist thriller and undertones of the advanced future of humanity as well as space battles and intrigue. The book is not a short one but you would be hard pressed to fit this much story into anything shorter.The only downside to this book is it is Holland's only sci fi novel!"}, {"userName": "Raluca", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8988257-raluca", "userReview": "I just couldn't finish this book.

Albeit, the main character is a hispanic (if there is still a racial division in that time) bisexual woman who seems to know what she wants but actually doesn't, but the Styths are a pretty borring warrior race, what is left of Earth is an Anarchy (and I'm just curious how that works out but that little detail is not important to the story, apparently, the writer is more interested in the Muslim based-off world of Styths) and the story has no freekin purpose.

The antagonist is more than real and the worlds seem a thin veil on the happenings between the people in the story. Her own unique style of writing appealed to me and gave me inspiration. Her plot and characters illuminated deeper insights into my own thoughts and feelings about the world and my own place in it. Sci-fi can do that sometimes. I love it. This book was amazingly good but I'd say there were 2 weaker qualities. I'd give the pacing and the ease of reading a 7 out of 10 but as you can see, those are not low scores.
