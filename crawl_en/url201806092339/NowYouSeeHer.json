After the match, there's an accident, the two girls swap bodies, and one ends up in a coma. The remaining girl, in the wrong body, has to solve the mystery of what happened and how to get them switched back. I love body swap books. I've read a lot of them, and think this one could have been even better. Read all my thoughts (and a list of body swap books)  HERE on Jen Ryland ReviewsAlso, I was thinking that something about the authors sounded familiar to me. A sister team of writers named Lisa and Laura ??? Remember The Liar Society trilogy by Lisa and Laura Roecker? (I think I read the first book.) Well, these are the same author-sisters (this time going by their married names.) Read more of my reviews on JenRyland.com! Check out my Bookstagram!

Pacing was solid for a mystery, the mystery itself was intriguing and it kept me guessing. Characters were so-so, a bit cliche. But all in all, it was a solid, no hustle type of book. A beach read, for sure."}, {"userName": "Meghan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34016213-meghan", "userReview": "I received this book as an advanced reader's copy for our young adult collection at the library. I could not put this book down. The character development between Amelia and Sophie and all of their friends were easy to relate to because they were so close to real-life actions. Just when you thought the story was going one direction with the plot, it takes an unexpected turn and you can't help to find out what happens next. Young Adults these days need more compelling, edge of your seat type of reading material and Now You See Her defines that exactly. Wonderful read that deserves infinite stars but I can only give it 5. 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1329108-julie", "userReview": "two girls who both like tennis and one gets into a coma.

A stranger offers to help and attempts to abduct her. She gets away and runs into the road, trying to signal down an oncoming car during the torrential rain, but is hit instead.When she wakes up she is stuck in the body of Sophie, the most popular girl in school and her tennis rival. Amelia goes through confusion and shock over the transformation and has to work her way through her memories to try and figure out who attempted to abduct her before they go after her little sister.Despite being very excited to read this, I was disappointed in the slow pace, repetition, and unnecessary details. There were also huge errors regarding the plot. First off, the weather conditions were so bad with torrential rain, lightning, and wind that Amelia was barely crawling on the road since she couldn\u2019t see anything. She had to pull her car over and wait the storm out because it was that bad. So why would Sophie be flying down the road during a thunderstorm when she can\u2019t see where she is driving? The weather conditions are detailed multiple times, referencing how scared Amelia was when she couldn\u2019t see the road in front of her.Amelia ends up in a coma with stitches all over her head and face and suffers broken bones and bruising. As someone who actually has been struck by a car while jogging, you don\u2019t suffer injuries to that extent unless you\u2019re hit at a fast speed. That\u2019s why it doesn\u2019t make sense that Sophie was speeding down the road in the middle of a storm when the rain was creating zero visibility. In actuality, Sophie should have been barely moving, like Amelia, and all that should have resulted was a small bump.For a while I thought that maybe Sophie was speeding to get away from something, and we would find out what that something was when Amelia went back to her own body. Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case. Sophie stupidly decided to have a joyride in the middle of a storm and obviously didn\u2019t care that she couldn\u2019t see anything out the windshield. So she strikes Amelia and somehow knocks herself out. Nothing was explained after this point so I\u2019m assuming she swerved after hitting Amelia, hydroplaned off the road, and crashed into some trees. Henceforth, Amelia wakes up in Sophie\u2019s body in the hospital after Sophie\u2019s physical body had been passed out for a few days (doesn\u2019t that qualify as a coma?) and had suffered a major concussion. I suffered a severe concussion after being struck by a car. I was ordered not to attend university classes, complete homework, study, drive, watch TV, read, text, etc. You\u2019re stagnant after suffering a concussion because you need adequate time (weeks to months depending on the severity) for your brain to heal. If you happen to ignore the rules, then there\u2019s a chance your brain won\u2019t heal properly and you\u2019ll forever be stuck with side effects, like me. Amelia-in-Sophie\u2019s-body drives Sophie\u2019s car and jumps right back into school, classes, and homework three days after suffering a concussion and never suffers any side effects. The only issue she had was her memories getting mixed up with Sophie\u2019s.Other than those two issues this was an okay read. I had hoped for some suspense and mystery, but there wasn\u2019t any. When I got to the end it seemed like there wasn\u2019t many answers to the questions presented at the beginning and we never learn why Amelia wakes up in Sophie\u2019s body in the first place.I received an ARC from Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Kathy Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3122948-kathy-martin", "userReview": "This twisty mystery starts at a tennis match, moves next to a car accident, and moves to a hospital where one girl wakes up in another girl's body. Amelia has just found out that her family - her mother, her sister, and herself - are getting ready to move again. This will be their eighth move in fifteen years. Amelia has given up on making friends but she hasn't given up playing tennis. That is one thing that she has been doing since she learned as a six-year-old. She tries a little magical thinking and hopes that winning the match will convince her mom to let them stay. Sophie Graham is the town's golden girl with bunches of friends and a life lived on Instragram. After defeating Amelia in the tennis match, she goes to drive home in a raging thunderstorm. Amelia has had her car break down and had someone creepy stop to help her. When she runs from him into the middle of the raod, Sophie hits her. Now Amelia is in intense care and not expected to recover and Sophie wakes up convinced that she is Amelia. Somehow Amelia woke up in Sophie's body. She doesn't recognize her father. She doesn't know why this happened but she knows she can't tell the Grahams. They just want everything to be normal again. Amelia tries to slip into Sophie's life and is regaining some of Sophie's memories which is rather terrifying since she feels she is losing Amelia's memories. However, she needs to find a way to convince her mother and sister that someone is after them. Luckily, she has Sophie's best friend Janie and boy next door Lance to help her unravel the mystery as long as she doesn't tell them that she is really Amelia.I enjoyed the characters in this one. I thought the mystery was well-developed and interesting."}, {"userName": "Celia Daughter)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28320113-celia-daughter", "userReview": "This book was a wild ride and I loved it. Though I picked up on the clues right away, it was still enjoyable to read. The dialogue felt a bit stale at time, but nothing that prevented me from not finishing it. The characters were also something I feel like I've seen hundred times before. Still, nothing too serious there.The ending seemed a little rushed and I hoped for something a bit better. It read very easily and I finished quite quickly since I couldn't really put it down. If you're looking for mystery and fun, this book it for you."}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5600312-natasha", "userReview": "It started out very promising and I was surprised that the body swap happened so quickly. At first, the two girls seemed so different but little clues are dropped along the way hinting at that supposed connection. I was a bit disappointed about the conclusion which appeared a bit too anti-climatic and was resolved way too easily. Could have been better."}, {"userName": "Dreaday", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10512221-dreaday", "userReview": "This book was so much fun! I\u2019ve been getting kind of burned out on reading lately, but I got super sucked in to this one. I started it, kept thinking about it, and then couldn\u2019t stop thinking about it! It was just a fun read- suspenseful and interesting, it kept me guessing until the end, which surprised me with a little extra twist at the end. I can\u2019t wait to sell this, and if this pair writes anything else, I will be PUMPED to read it, too!!"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13844522-laura", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to get an ARC of this novel in a contest that Lisa and Laura hosted on Instagram (Very Sophie Graham of you ladies!).I'm not going to post any spoilers, but it was so good and had even more twists that I imagined it would. I loved the two characters - Sophie and Amelia - and how the body swap allowed them to see into the other person's life. I teach high school and I think that this idea - that what we think is a perfect life or a not perfect life really isn't what it seems - is one that is so valid and important for us to realize and show to teens. Do yourself a favor, go check out this book when it's published in June. You won't be able to put it down!"}], "description": "AMELIA has always felt like a happy life is just out of reach.
