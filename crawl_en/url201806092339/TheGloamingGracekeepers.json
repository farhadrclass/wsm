Logan achieves the feat with her world building that is sufficiently nebulous and ambiguous in giving the reader the path of seeing and interpreting the novel as they wish. The narrative focuses on the issues of identity, what it is to be a woman, loss, grief and love with Logan drawing us in with her sublime atmospheric prose and descriptions. On a remote Scottish island, the Ross family reside in a ruined home that resists efforts to improve it. The parents, Signe and Peter, have backgrounds respectively in ballet dancing and boxing, both physically demanding and brutal occupations that have left indelible scars on their bodies.Signe and Peter have three children, Barra (Bee), Mara and Islay, who have grown up on the island where no-one dies, but a person becomes petrified, turned to stone on the cliffs looking out towards the unforgiving sea. The forces of nature are indomitable, uncompromising, making its presence felt on all islanders. Tragedy beckons and in its wake comes a new arrival on the scene. Pearl is a mermaid, both mysterious and alluring to Mara. A love story blossoms, and the two of them leave the island, only to return as Peter and Signe begin to turn into stone. A strong element of dripping sadness pervades the text of this coming of age novel. Providing you take the time to become immersed in the twin of elements of magic and reality, this is a wonderfully imaginative book on the difficulties and challenges of life, folklore, selkies, and being a woman. A powerfully woven spellbinding story from Kirsty Logan.

The arrival of part-time mermaid, Pearl, ignites the ashes of a passion inside Mara. This passion is a desire to see what would happen if she would dare to take a step off the island, and enter the chaos of reality that lies beyond it. But the island has its own particular allure that is harder to shake than she might think.The interwoven realistic and fantastical elements of this story made this a delightful and whimsical read, throughout. The enchanting elements, rather than detract from the real-world issues and the darker subject matters that were broached, heightened the emotional elements and threw them into stark relief. There was a clever juxtaposition consistently created that saw each scene oscillate between tender embraces and sudden deaths, compassionate moments and fits of passion, delicate features and iron wills.The almost otherworldly backdrop was another example of Logan's careful creation and seamless blend of the whimsical with the every-day. The setting fitfully grasped at recognisable aspects of contemporary life as well as abstract concepts and fairy-tale imagery to create a landscape I could never fully imagine and yet felt entirely at home in. This was a world that was both known and yet one dually longed for.The power of this novel also lay in its quiet moments. There is so much said in so few words and so much broadly hinted at with nothing bluntly delivered. Logan has penned a story and yet allowed the reader to become the architect of it. The ungraspable elements that have dogged every part of this makes it feel like a novel created by both reader and author. This element, however, is one that ensures everyone can find exactly what they are looking for in this novel. Just like I did.I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

That sadly bored me to tears. No matter how hard I tried I could not engage with these characters, I found reading a chore. Sometimes a book just doesn't fit with a reader because of circumstances outside of everyone's control. I feel this is one of those times. The storyline was so magical, so ethereal... The mix between reality and folklore should have worked for me. The beautiful exploration of the feminine should have worked... This was a novel all about women and how the world affects us, how we deal emotionally with the occurrences of life. But I'm here feeling somewhat confused. Mara, who appears to have been the main character just never left off the page and grabbed me. I spent so much time confused between Mara, her sister Islay and their mother Signe... No one identity truly felt complete to me. This is a book about the intangibilities of life, about myth and magics, but to me the book needed a stronger MC to anchor the storyline, to give it an earthier feel among all the ethereal characters. I would have loved to have understood Pearl in particular as a character. I really wanted to know about her relationship with Mara from Pearl's viewpoint. Perhaps it would have helped me to fully connect with them as a couple. Signe, the mother, to me was the most interesting of the female characters. Her actions and motivations at times were confusing to me but because she had this inner complexity unlike the other characters I was fascinated by all she did and said. And I really did love the completion of her character arc. Another point I did enjoy was this idea of a stony grave. Of people slowing down over time to complete stillness but still somehow not being apart from the living, this idea that they were still waiting for something even after the end.... It was very beautifully written. The prose was rather odd to me. It was beautiful but then at times it seemed a little crass. It's not that there were that many swear words used or indeed that it was ever offensive. This book certainly isn't. I just found the use of swear words juxtaposed in a rather unsettling manner with what I was expecting from this style of book. I guess I was searching for something a little more traditionally poetic. I did try to like this book. But ultimately I struggled greatly with it. I found it to be too slow moving and I just was not a huge fan of how the majority of the characters were written.To me it's somewhere between 1 and 2 stars. *An e-copy of this book was kindly provided to me by the publisher, Random House UK Vintage Publishing, via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Sonja Arlow", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow", "userReview": "3.5 starsI wish Netgalley had made it very clear that this was a prequel to The Gracekeepersas I think the story would have had an even deeper meaning for me had I read that book first.But this story had its own merits and charm. The writing was at times mesmerising making you feel like you are coming up for air when you stop reading.The story is not permeated by magical realism except for one little detail. Once a person reaches a certain age they slowly turn to stone, finally make their painfully slow way up the cliffs surrounded by their family and friends, and right at the last moment take their place among the statues. I thought the idea of this type of departure was beautifully depicted. The phenomenon was never explained, it felt like just a part of life on this island.The main character is Mara, she lives with her sister Islay and brother Bee in an old ramshackle house with their parents. Growing up the island is a treasure-trove of discovery and delight but after the family suffers a devastating loss they start to fracture. Islay leaves the island and Mara draws into herself until she is almost invisible. That is until Pearl arrives, she is the spark that brings life back into Mara\u2019s eyes (and bed).This is a tale about the effect of loss, but it is also about the magical pull of love, family and roots. And like all good magical realism books there is a hint of darkness underneath everything.An easy recommendationARC Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4004839-heather", "userReview": "A gorgeously, luxuriously dark follow up to Kirsty's debut.

A large, pink-ish and abandoned mansion makes for their new home; however, despite their feigned efforts, it will never be completely renovated. Truthfully, it will never be anything but a house in ruins. Come hell or high water, the Ross family seeks desperately for a place to stay grounded. Mirroring the family's desire, the nameless island fights continuously against the dominant force of the sea. When its residents are about to die, they climb up a hill where they will become statues forever. Finally, they reach stillness, a place where their roots can cling to the earth.The Gloaming is a story about hope, growing up, love and grief. Angela Carter\u2019s influence in this book speaks volumes, offering that unique twist to fairy tales, those stories that talk of ferocious beasts, maidens with hacked-off toes or mermaids that kill children. Logan explores the real meaning behind these fairy tales; more specifically, gender roles, the oppression of women and the idealized concept of love. A fairy tale does not necessarily suggest a fairy-tale ending. Does happiness mean staying in the same place and fighting for what you love? Is there any happiness in abandoning and getting back to your old self? The Ross sisters had been exposed to sugar-coated fairy tales while growing up, and only their turning point occurs when they finally experience that suffocating feeling from a love that consumes everything, even your own identity. The fisherman snatched the selkie's skin to force her to stay; however, no matter how much you give the selkie in return, she will always long for the sea.Furthermore, the Ross family is inevitably involved in a constant struggle between stillness and change. The false sense of balance that they are striving to hold can lead to a relentless storm, whose force sweeps everything on its way, while also returning everything to its place.How are these stories different from real life? Read the book to find out. You will be surprised to discover how a story full of fantastical elements conveys such a real message.\u2014**I received this book free from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Helen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51266809-helen", "userReview": "This story is a fantastical meld of folk/fairy tales and magical realism. I have read very little magical realism before so found it a little hard going to begin with but the story itself was captivating and I became so invested in the characters that I couldn't put the book (Kindle) away and had to stay up late to finish it off (within 24 hours).We follow the Ross family through a tragic accident which affects each family member in a completely different way. We go back in time to the meeting of the boxer and the ballerina, then up to present day, with an 18 year old girl, just discovering who she wants to be, and her meeting with a part-time mermaid!Kirsty Logan has created a completely believable world with stunning prose - this is a beautiful literary fiction novel. Yes, it's true that some of the characters could be a little more developed or 'fleshed out' - this could easily have been a much longer book and would still have been as captivating but, for me, I loved this read and would recommend it wholeheartedly."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50370833-emma", "userReview": "First of all, I'd like to thank Netgalley and the publisher for providing me with an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review.This is the second Kirsty Logan novel I've read, and The Gloaming reminded me of The Gracekeepers in a lot of ways - good and bad.Let's start with the good: Logan's prose is gorgeously evocative, conjuring up wild landscapes, dreamy tenderness and all-too-human awkwardness with equal ease. This is definitely a fairy tale of sorts, and her writing style is perfectly suited to the task of bringing the strange magic of the island she's created to life.However, despite the fact that her writing style seems perfect for this novel, it never really felt like Logan was truly leaning into the story's full potential. While the island's magic and nature's wildness had an undeniable influence on the narrative, they always felt somewhat limited in scope; the themes of family, grief, leaving and returning were constants throughout the book, but it never quite seemed to figure out what it was saying about them; and the scenes between Mara and Pearl were usually beautifully written, but they never actually gave much sense of who they were as individuals (especially Pearl) or how they fit together. In fact, in some ways it felt like the character I understood best at the end of the story was Signe, even though the main character was ostensibly her daughter Mara.Despite my occasional frustration with it, this is a lovely novel and I quite enjoyed it! I have to say, there was a wonderfully poignant twist at the end which I really liked, and I appreciated the use of stories and folklore (and Scots language!!) throughout. I just always kind of felt like I was waiting for something more - more cohesion, more character development, more enchantment. But I'm certainly glad that there's one more magical novel about women who love women in the world!"}, {"userName": "Moray Teale", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7270869-moray-teale", "userReview": "On the island where Mara and her family live people don\u2019t die, the go to the cliff where they remain, gazing out to sea with the waves crashing beneath, their presence a haunting reminder of what is to come for the islanders. And Mara\u2019s family is haunted by many things, long-ago decisions, new desires and a devastating loss that has scarred Mara inside and out. A new arrival seems to finally offer the chance to move on but the budding relationship brings challenges of its own. I\u2019ve been waiting for this book from Kirsty Logan. So far I have read everything she\u2019s published and so far I\u2019ve always felt that there was some essential element missing so that, despite the boundless potential I could see in her writing, I was always left dissatisfied. Here her bewitching prose and wicked humour finally fully combine with the grim(m) fairy-tale properties to create something rich and dark and emotionally resonant. I think the difference is in the characters. In her previous work I felt a distance to her characters that couldn\u2019t be overcome by the gloriously dark imagery but Mara and her family felt less like props for Logan\u2019s imagined world and more like real people occupying real (if fantastic) space.Themes of transformation, transience and permanence are perfectly modeled by the overriding medium of water which is a constant, inescapable presence within the family \u2013 selkies, mermaids, the ocean as a constant force that outlasts all else \u2013 the power of nature to give and to take.

However, it\u2019s long on atmosphere, imagination, and a charming lesbian love story. Islay, Mara and Barra have grown up on a tiny Scottish island, after their parents, Signe and Peter, brought them there when the two eldest girls were very small. Signe and Peter have compelling backstories of their own; Signe was once a professional ballet dancer, reaching the pinnacle of her career in Swan Lake, while Peter fought as a lightweight boxer. Logan emphasises the physicality and brutality of both these vocations: we might be unsurprised by the depiction of Peter\u2019s damaging fights, but we also read about the physical toll of Signe\u2019s work: \u2018On the first day of rehearsals, Signe\u2019s feet were a size 5 1/2. After a few weeks they were down to a size 5\u2026 She taped her toes before every show, but it wasn\u2019t enough. The skin on the knuckles of her toes was all sliced off, and she danced too often for it to heal. Most nights she bled right through her pointe shoes.\u2019 Signe\u2019s suffering recalls the original Hans Christian Andersen story \u2018The Little Mermaid\u2019, where the little mermaid can only gain human legs through feeling as if she\u2019s walking on knives.Logan\u2019s first novel, The Gracekeepers, demonstrated that she\u2019s one of the few contemporary writers who understands how to handle folktale, and this talent is on full display in The Gloaming. Whether she\u2019s weaving familiar folktales about selkies and mermaids into the narrative, or writing her own myths about concubines in towers, Logan gets what makes folktales work, and isn\u2019t tempted to distort them. However, she also tells a slight but absorbing plot about the love story between Mara and Pearl, a mixed-race girl who comes to the island and keeps an old bus filled with books. Mara and Pearl leave the island together to perform as mermaids on cruise ships and in other glamorous settings, capitalising on their talent for holding their breath. But they are ultimately pulled back to it when they realise that, like many other islanders, Peter and Signe are gradually turning to stone.The Gloaming felt more widely resonant to me than The Gracekeepers because it is even less rooted in a particular world \u2013 whether that\u2019s the real world or a speculative, parallel version. The island feels figurative in a way that\u2019s difficult to pin down. Is it, as Islay speculates, a place that people go to die, a kind of halfway house between life and death, in the same way as the gloaming is halfway between night and day? Or is it actually the only solid place, which explains why Islay, Mara and Pearl\u2019s adventures in the world outside are deliberately sketchy and unformed? \u201cThings off the island \u2013 they\u2019re not real,\u201d Mara tells Pearl. 'All those hours under the water with Pearl,' she thinks. 'Their bright wigs and their shimmering tails\u2026 But Mara knew now that they\u2019d stayed under the water too long\u2026 \u201cIt\u2019s just too hard. It\u2019s too much. I don\u2019t want to drown.\u201d' Mara and Pearl seem to have lived out the bulk of their relationship in the space between one breath and another, and are now coming back to earth.The slipperiness of the world-building in both Logan\u2019s novels is simultaneously a strength and their weakness. At times, I wished that she would take firmer hold of this world and expand on its possibilities, think about why certain islanders are turned to stone, and if there really are selkies in the sea surrounding Mara\u2019s island. In short, I wonder what would happen if she made her fiction more firmly speculative, rather than staying in folktale territory. I liked some of her short stories in The Rental Heart precisely because they had to have neater edges. But on the other hand, I can see that The Gloaming works partly because there are no clear rules. It\u2019s an eerie and magical book, even if I\u2019d love to see Logan dive off in a new direction for her next. As for the actual mermaids of 2018: we might have to wait for Louise O\u2019Neill\u2019s The Surface Breaks to meet them.I received a free proof copy of this novel from the publisher for review."}, {"userName": "Christina Reid", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66496256-christina-reid", "userReview": "Anyone who loved Kirsty Logan's previous novel, The Gracekeepers, should also enjoy this.

It was a gentle, dreamy sort of read, but there was a darker undercurrent which kept me intrigued.Mara, Islay and Barra are the three children of Signe and Peter, who have come to the island to set up a bed and breakfast in a ruined old mansion. Their lives are pleasant and magical, but then tragedy strikes and their lives are changed forever. Later, Mara meets a mysterious young woman named Pearl - a mermaid who performs in exotic hotels. Nothing on the island is what it seems. When people die, they don't die - they walk up to a cliff where they become stone statues. It is implied that there other magic at work but it's not explicitly shown. Instead, the book focuses on grief, love and loss of many kinds, presenting a compassionate and delicately written portrait of its characters.There were many things I really liked about The Gloaming - there is a lesbian relationship which is always nice to see, and I loved the tone of the writing and the quirky characters. It started a bit slow and took me a while to get into, but I didn't really mind as I felt it suited the story. It's very different from The Gracekeepers but at the same time, similar.

A lot of the feelings and the little moments that I could tell were supposed to be symbolic and powerful and show me something just went over my head. I just didn\u2019t get it.I didn\u2019t get Pearl, I didn\u2019t get the mermaid stuff, I didn\u2019t get the island magic that was just there, unexplained and not really magic and I didn\u2019t get the transition into first person or the flashbacks and anecdotes or just \u2026 any of it.This is not to say this is a bad book, not at all - it was beautifully written and there were parts that really spoke to me like when Mara experienced a revelation as a reader toward the beginning, which I had experienced as a writer a few years ago.\u201cOver that winter she read a hundred deaths \u2013 and when the book ended, she could turn to the first page again, and the death was undone.\u201dFor me it was the weird power of writing \u2013 you create a character, control their lives, create them in every dimension and way, make them real to the reader and then in just a few short words, take them away as if they were never there to start with.

Although\u00a0The Gloaming\u00a0has chapters from other points of the view, the primary focus of this novel is on Mara, a middle child, and her life upon the island she was raised on for the latter half of her life. Then tragedy strikes. Magic returns to her life upon meeting Pearl, another woman living on the island, bringing even more change along with her arrival into Mara's life.There is something beautiful about\u00a0The Gloaming. But there is also something incredibly solitary about the characters that echoed in my reading experience, making the journey even more personal. Although this book has multiple points of view, it focuses mainly on Mara, and her life upon the island she grew up on. It is about loss and, like I mentioned, loneliness; about finding someone who understands you, and the magic of home, as well as the suffering it will cause you.Despite the magical undertones (and overtones) of this novel, through the actions of characters and the stories they tell themselves and others, there is something incredibly normal about the characters. They have aspirations and anxieties that I could relate to, and I found that very grounding as I read this, such as the fears Mara had in her relationship with Pearl, or the anger Islay has for her home. Kirsty Logan manages to retain the magic of the island without making the characters into untouchable beings. Pearl became more human the longer Mara spent with her, but it was because of this I grew to love her and Mara's relationship, as well as the parts of Pearl that seemed just a touch unreal, although it never really becomes clear if Pearl really\u00a0is\u00a0human or not.Unfortunately, the further I got into this novel, the more annoyed I got at the changing points of view. I loved whenever Pearl and Mara were the main voices of the chapter. However, when Islay, or Mara's parents, took over, I tended to lose interest and skim read. It was interesting reading about them at first, but the chapters began to feel repetitive. Generally all her parents did was praise Bee, which, while I understood it at first, began to just annoy me as that seemed to be all they did in a majority of their chapters, and became even more annoying after some revelations towards the last 60 pages of the novel. Islay mostly grated on me as she was a very selfish character. There didn't seem to be any love there at all for her family, which didn't seem justified, as they never really did anything to directly harm her, and her character really only grew on me in the last 60 pages as well.\"Fuck them. Let them stare at the angry scarred girl. She smiled so wide that her face twisted into a mask.\"I think what I really loved about this novel was Pearl and Mara's relationship. It was refreshing, and heartwarming; however, it was also realistic, and seeing the conflicts within their relationship, while difficult to read as I loved them so much, was also enjoyable. And I mean that because I think it's rare to see conflicts that are actually realistic, as they are less about miscommunication- which I'm used to reading in so, so many novels- and more about their life and desires, difficult to solve. The two are also very fleshed out- Mara becomes harder after tragedy, but around the more hesitant and careful Pearl, lets herself soften and also discuss her own worries with her. Their relationship was\u00a0healthy, and I loved that.\"The book ended with these lines: 'They didn't live happily ever after, like a couple in a story. But they were happy for a while, and perhaps that's all we can ask.'\"The Gloaming\u00a0is very easy to read. Kirsty Logan writes beautifully, and having the focus of the story so much on Mara made the chapters I didn't like slightly more bearable as I knew what I had to look forward to. Although the characters experience upsetting losses and have to learn to cope over time, they also learn to love and move on in their own ways (although some don't). I really recommend this book, and I'm looking forward to reading\u00a0The Gracekeepers\u00a0and any future novels Kirsty Logan releases!"}, {"userName": "Eleanor Ward", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76059803-eleanor-ward", "userReview": "I thought this was a really beutiful, tender story, about the growth one girl goes through on her odd island (I loved the island by the way!!)

This unusual match somehow triggers nature and becomes something very special. Signe soon falls pregnant, but of the three babies, only one, Islay, survives. After they had their second daughter, Mara, they move to a remote Scottish island into a huge house. This is where their third kid, the long awaited boy, Bee, arrives. Yet, the forces of nature demand donations and soon the rough sea catches young Bee and leaves the family devastated. Islay flees the haunted island as soon as she can. Mara remains there with the parents not only grieving but also deteriorating more form day to day. With the arrival of Pearl, the chance for Mara to have a more positive look on life suddenly opens up. But Pearl is mysterious and she, too, has a close connection to the earthly forces.\u201cThe Gloaming\u201d is an outstanding novel. It is not exactly fantasy, nor can it completely be classified as a kind of fairy tale. It is somewhere in between the reality as we know it and hardly palpable forces that come from the earth. They are not supernatural, quite the opposite, they are natural and thus guide the characters and decide on what happens. It is somehow close to very old cultures, old folkloristic sagas and beliefs that revive and are called back to the people\u2019s memory. What I liked best about the novel was the way Kirsty Logan created the atmosphere. Throughout the novel, you have the feeling that there is something about the island or the house, something beyond the characters\u2019 control. It is spooky somehow and gives you the creeps at times. On the other hand, there is a sadness and melancholy which weighs especially on Mara and with is often hard to support.There is something magical in the novel, yet, it wasn\u2019t exactly the kind of book I love to read."}, {"userName": "MRIDULA", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67269664-mridula", "userReview": "Read full review @https://ecstaticyetchaotic.wordpress....The gloaming by Kristi Logan is a book that transports you to an island which is both mystical and dark.

Its a calculative mix of fairytale, magic, and folklore, with a lot of dark mysteries. Peter and Signe, a boxer and ballet dancer respectively, live in a house that refuses to be taken care of. They have three kids- Mara, Islay, and Bee. And then a crazy accident happens, that throws Mara off balance. She has lost all interest in life and then she meets Pearl- a mermaid dancer.

An absolute must read for fans, but also a good start into Logan's writing if you haven't read any of her works yet. Personally, I couldn't spot any specific connections between the novels, though it's been a while since I read the first one. What I did notice: small connections linking this world to her short stories, and I liked that a lot \u2013 to think that all those little, magical elements are part of the same world. But you don't have to have read any of those stories and can jump right in with \"The Gloaming\". (Though, in retrospect, there are some connections even I noticed: queer, loving women, the beautiful, unrelenting sea as a big part of the story, the calm narration, the lyrical writing.)I don't know yet if I'm generally a fan of magical realism, but I'm certainly a big fan of Kirsty Logan's. The little elements that make her world not quite like ours after all, but close enough that it could be ours. So much really, that sometimes you can't be sure what really is magical or not. Are there really selkies? What happens to the dead? Is the sea willing to bargain with us? There's a beauty, another magic in not quite knowing that makes the book all the more enjoyable.It's necessary, too, since this a rather quiet story \u2013 in a way. Much is happening, the plot spans over years, and for some: lifetimes. But it's a creeping narration, slowly edging closer to the end, engaging nonetheless. We see life and death, happiness and regrets, the isolation being stuck brings with it, how sadness can infect the mind. Those almost-or-fully-magical elements bring a light with them that are much needed for both the characters and the reader.In the centre of it all is Mara, though she's not the sole focus. The story keeps jumping \u2013 between characters, between times. Like the sea does to the land, the narration chips away layer after layer, revealing new depths, secrets, sometimes just the past, sometimes horrible yet human thoughts. It was fascinating to see how Logan managed to create a harmonious, organic whole without ever making the story too jumpy. How she connected such different characters such as Mara's parents, a boxer and a ballerina; Mara and her sister Islay, one stocky and scarred, hiding, the other conventionally beautiful, demanding and almost cruel at times; the sisters and their little brother Bee, two loved and one adored; Mara and her lover Pearl, one drawn to this island and one drawn to the sea, to freedom.Speaking of lovers, I also have to give props to Logan for the sex scenes in this book. They're graceful without ever getting flowery or wishy-washy. And can I just say how nice it was to see two queer women exploring and loving each other? Fair warning, their relationship is not without its issues. But especially in the beginning, there was a playfulness there that was very satisfying to read. __________Whether you're already a fan of Kirsty Logan or not, as long as you like a little magic and love the sea in all it's cruelty and beauty, as long as you're happy to be whisked away to a stormy island, then you should absolutely pick up \"The Gloaming\"."}, {"userName": "Daisy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18015815-daisy", "userReview": "Quality Rating: Four StarsEnjoyment Rating: Five Stars\u25c6 Thanks to Netgalley for this ebook for review \u25c6Oh, for the love of fairytales. This is a story made for lovers of books, of the sea, of fairytales, of love stories and of magic. It's halfway between a fairytale and a literary fiction novel itself, and it sucked me in straight from the start.It's not exactly what I would call magical realism - at least not in the literal sense. Which is ironic because no one can quite define magical realism. We have mermaids that turn out to not be mermaids, and curses that are more or less imagined, but we also have people turning to stone (or do they?). As much as the genre frustrates a lot of people, I have to say I love the way the interpretations belong to their readers. I read The Gloaming from he magical perspective but I'm sure you can read it more from the realist one and enjoy it just as much.This is simultaneously a book where not much happens, and yet you're constantly waiting for the next thing. Logan's writing is enchanting in and of itself, but by following four or five interweaving characters, there are patterns and clues that you pick up from each one that connects everything. From what I remember of The Gracekeepers, there was a similar sort of structure; multiple players jumping around the main plot as they travel around together. The Gloaming is more isolated geographically but builds it characters up bigger I think.It's a beautiful story, but damn it's sad. There's obviously a commentary on modernisation, growing up in general and love. That's not to say it's an unhappy ending. On the contrary, I felt a somewhat cathartic joy when I finished it on the train. I think it's really important we have stories that have tough topics but also representation that end well (the lesbian romance is some of the best representation of its kind I've read). Not all struggles have to end in misery, especially not in fiction.I almost want to study this book. The recurring symbols, the metaphors, the little retellings. It's as rich as something you'd read in school but so much more creative. I hope Logan continues to receive recognition and will hopefully be able to give us more soon."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31482329-laura", "userReview": "Hauntingly written The Gloaming by Kirsty Logan follows the life of the Ross family in their tatterdemalion guest house, practically falling in to the sea, on an unnamed island somewhere in the Scottish Hebrides. It\u2019s an island where no one really leaves, figuratively or literally, with some strange magic drawing every wanderer back and every death is not a death but a slowing down, slowing until the islander turns to stone on a cliff facing the sea.The Gloaming is an awkward book to review as so much, whether thematically or structurally, that giving away a little can give away a lot. There is some magic though you\u2019ll be hard pressed, apart from the petrified islanders on the cliff, to spot it for certain. That is part of the book, and magic\u2019s, charm but towards the end the charm began to rub off. Where I thought there would be a climax the story circled back and left my emotions feeling deflated. I recognise that this was the point, to deny the reader a resolution since a key theme (at least that I identified) is how, like the gloaming, nothing lasts forever and we are all stories that are continuing to unfold and change; however, such endings work only when there has been a sign of growth, we go on but not exactly as before, otherwise what\u2019s the point? I think some of my frustration comes from a sense that Logan didn\u2019t \u2018lean in\u2019 on the magic or folklore elements. The narrative dips its toe but shies away just as it gets interesting, and then repeats the process a few chapters later. It ended up leaving a lot more questions than answers, though yes, I know, we don\u2019t always want to know how the magician does the trick. For me it would have helped if the story settled in to Folklore adaptation (I did get some flashbacks to the film Song of the Sea/Amhr\u00e1n na Mara) or Magic Realism. I have read other reviews that suggest The Gloaming takes place in the same universe as The Gracekeepers so perhaps it\u2019s my own fault for not reading that first.I also found it difficult to engage with the characters. There are six key characters, Signe and Peter Ross, former ballerina and boxer, raising Islay (pronounced Eye-la), Mara and Barra (Bee), then later Pearl, Mara\u2019s girlfriend. Oh, yes, this is an LGBT+ friendly book, and no, Mara\u2019s story does not revolve around pain or tragedy caused by being gay! To be honest, I would read it for that alone. Anyway! Something tragic happens which I won\u2019t mention upfront for fear of spoilers but lordy lord I wanted to shake these characters something fierce. It could be taken that the family\u2019s arc is them coping with grief, in which case as someone who has climbed that hill already, I can confidently say none of them have healthy coping strategies. This made reading hardest for me because I couldn\u2019t empathise with them, when they were wilful (e.g. Islay leaving the island) I wanted to smack them with the arm of one of the petrified islanders, and when they were human their idiosyncrasies were so watered down each character melted in to the other. There were a few scenes, especially if all four women were together, where I could lose track of who was speaking or doing what. Once again, what I felt like enough questions weren\u2019t answered about the characters for me to really dig in.However, the language is beautiful. Logan is at her best when describing a physical or emotional experience, or giving personality to the sea shore or inside of a run-down old mansion. There were a few points where she would code switch but it didn\u2019t detract from the pace or sense of the scene or chapter. It reads especially well for fans of Jen Campbell, it was no surprise to see her name in the acknowledgements.All that said, I did like the book. And lesbian selkies is definitely a sub-genre I want to see more of.*full disclosure: I received an uncorrected proof ebook through NetGalley for free in exchange for a review.

Apparently the island is evil. or maybe the sea. or the dead?

So if you're looking for cute, funny and fluffy or even an actual love story then this isn't the book for you.
