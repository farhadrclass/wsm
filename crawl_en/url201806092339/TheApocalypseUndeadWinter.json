T.M. Williams does a wonderful job capturing each character's emotions; be it fear, helplessness, or even raw joy. Through the various accounts of despair, tragic beauty, and blind hope, the reader will have a hard time putting this book down. The Apocalypse - Undead Winter is a refreshing and unique account of mankind's struggle with an uncertain future."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Zwolsky", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31389099-elizabeth-zwolsky", "userReview": "This is not your typical \"Zombie\" story,this gave me nightmares on how this version of the un-dead could really happen.Thank you T.M Williams for making me finally fear the Un-dead."}, {"userName": "Ronald Tobin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7836439-ronald-tobin", "userReview": "Perhaps you have read many zombie stories. If you have, you likely also have a certain expectation of how the zombies are going to behave. You know, just a bunch of shambling, decaying reanimated bodies bent on eating brains (or simply live human flesh) to sustain their mindless undead existence. They can generally be killed via head shots or decapitation. If you get bit, then you will turn into one unless you get your brains blown out prior to the change. Some stories do have some interaction between \u2018normal\u2019 humans and zombies, however the pattern is not strayed from too far\u2026usually.With THE APOCALYPSE, T.M. Williams takes the zombie apocalypse story in a very different direction. These zombies are not slow moving, brainless shambling undead. Oh no, these zombies are the very essence of what nightmares are made of. These zombies are smart. They are quick. They are preternaturally intelligent and they have no moral compass. Even more frightening, they actually evolve. Yes, there is plenty of blood and gore to be found between these pages, it is definitely NOT for the squeamish. This book is for those who appreciate also having to THINK while they read and watch out for the subplots, as this book certainly has them. Paying attention is vital, not a single scene can be legitimately regarded as superfluous or redundant. This book frightened me often, something that rarely happens.The novel takes place in the very near future. Starting in a FEMA camp. Yes, the government played a very large role in bringing these zombies into being and in creating the conditions for their evolution. To find out just HOW, well you will need to read the book. Suffice it to say I doubt this novel will be popular in government circles and yes, I can see the government doing all the things that happen here. In that regard it is coldly sobering.The novel has several well developed characters. The two that I found the most fascinating were the First Lady of the United States and Danny Ruiz. As to an actual favorite? This a very DARK novel. What many may find unsettling as they read it is that it is often difficult to decide who is \u2018right\u2019 and who is \u2018wrong.\u2019 As such it really keeps your attention. I read it over the space of three days and when I was done I spent a few days really digesting it.So who prevails? How does the story close? For that you will need to read it, and it is very much worth doing so.Kudos to the editor, the book has no major typos, nothing happens that will toss the reader out of the story, and that I appreciate.T.M. Williams can write a story that nightmares are made of. This surely proves that. If you enjoy horror that will make you THINK, then grab this book!"}, {"userName": "Talon Smith", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28982659-talon-smith", "userReview": "I received this book in a giveaway and was a bit apprehensive about another zombie story, but hey I signed up for it. Boy was i thrown for a curve when I discovered the immensity of this life-like zombie apocalypse. In the beginning everything seemed normal for the world, just an outbreak of some new virus. No big deal. But then when it was realized as an airborne contagion, chaos ensued as the masses became infected. The first group was ravenous and bloodthirsty, primal. But slowly as time passes a second breed arises, this one more cunning, lethal, intelligent, yet still not without a certain feral undertone. This new breed begins a plan for world domination; only the strong(or second breed) survive, the weak(first breed) are to die off. The story is told form the perspective of those immune and those freshly infected with the second virus. It begins with the tales of several people who have not been infected yet, but were living their daily lives until the actual infection began to spread. Then you get to see the urges that the virus causes, come out in the Undead as they search for the living. Many of the immune decided to hide themselves, trying to stay alive, but after a time they begin to give up on life, observing that there is no reason to go on when there is no hope left.The story escalated nicely(which I am grateful for, because when a novel is so slow that chapters don't push the story along, I feel like giving up on them) and the characters stories were very well planned and thought upon. I have to admit I was a bit confused in the first chapter, but it quickly dissipated as I continued reading. I love the idea of this virus and the realistic nature about it, like this could actually happen. It was a refreshing story with all of the casual brand Zombie novels they publish today. I can honestly say I loved this book and will always, as it is an inspiration to me. I've had a itching sensation to read it again. All-in-All this books deserves the 5/5 I gave it and I would like to thank Mrs. Williams. I did thoroughly enjoy the ride."}, {"userName": "Toadfist32", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54480696-toadfist32", "userReview": "I bought this book on whim, on a recommendation from a friend. After all, she knows how much that I love zombies. I put them off for a few months\u2014too much to do. But I finally cracked it open and barely got a few pages in before I felt a massive headache starting. This book is now kindling for my next barbeque. I\u2019ve read better fanfiction written by 14 year old, hormonal teenagers. This honestly makes Stephanie Meyer\u2019s poor grasp of grammar seem better by comparison!If you want my advice, read some King, Koontz, or Heinlein to see some actual GOOD writing. Hell, LJ Smith is a goddess of fine writing compared to this trash. Smith was able to make a good series without needing to retort to rape scenes! And she even got her stuff on TV!I have read some BAD things in my 30-some years of life, but this\u2026 this takes the whole god-damned bakery! I literally can\u2019t understand why literally none of the reviews on here have said next to nothing of both the poor grammar and the rape scenes."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30094728-stephanie", "userReview": "Not the typical zombie story at all! I love that the characters that are infected in this book are not brain dead bodies in search of nothing but human flesh. There is an actual story that is enticing and exciting to read. The characters are very interesting, and it's great that each chapter focuses on a different person. Everyone in the book are somehow connected, so there are no loose ends to tie up. The epilogue was also a great way to get more in site on how the infection started and spread. I am very happy with this book. It's so refreshing to see a different take on zombie/apocalypse type books. This is a definite page turner that keeps you hungry for more."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20225008-nikki", "userReview": "I have been looking forward to this book for quite some time. Definitely worth the wait. There is a zombie apocalypse. The world has basically ended. Where do we go from here? Undead Winter The Apocalypse brings you into a world of despair, where if you aren't infected yet, it's only a matter of time. A world of hope, to a point. Is there an antidote?

There's a reason it's called 'chronoLOGICAL'. Not that there is a lot of plot to begin with. This book has got rape, incest, necrophilia and some weird anti-vaxx propaganda - and no-one knows why. Neither of these things add anything to the story besides \"Oh, so the zombies are evil. Got it.\" Maybe it would shock me more if I knew the characters better. But I don't because most of them are featured in 2-3 chapters - written in their POV, even - before being randomly killed off for no apparent reason.Lastly, and this is something that could be avoided by using Google every once in a while, the whole thing is poorly researched, especially when it comes to geography, politicians and human medicine. You cannot set a story in 2021 and not refer to events and people that have happened resp. existed in 2014."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33192114-jen", "userReview": "I received this book through Goodreads First Reads and I have to be honest, I didn't love it but I didn't hate it either. The Good: Ms. Williams writes well in her prose and descriptions and her take on the apocalyptic zombies brought as sense of horrifying realism. While there were some graphic scenes, they served a purpose in the story and not just there for the sake of being there which is always a plus. I imagine that fans of World War Z will like this one too. The Bad: Truthfully, if I hadn't felt obligated to give an honest review because I received this through First Reads, I wouldn't have finished it. That said, it's not a bad book and when I did finish it, I did like it. So why wouldn't I have finished it? There are a lot of characters and the story doesn't move chronologically so it was very confusing. Despite this book's length, it is not a light read by any means. Overall, The Apocalypse: Undead Winter is worth a read, especially if you have a love of zombies."}, {"userName": "Nicolette", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800517-nicolette", "userReview": "First off, thanks to the lovely folks at Goodreads and the author for providing me with my first reads copy!I am going strictly by the actual rating system here. It was...okay. I know I'm in the minority with not being completely enamoured with this book, and I'd probably give it more like 2 and a half stars. I wanted to like it. I really, really did. I absolutely adore the premise, but the execution...just kind of didn't do it for me. The exposition was vague at best until the timeline at the very end (which actually helped a whole boat-ton), the characters all kind of started to mesh together for me (with the exception of the First Lady, who was kind of awesome in her own evil way), and I kept getting knocked out of the story by the grammatical errors, something I try not to complain about too much, but they were really, really jarring to me.I dunno.

Dark, addicting, and a \"could this be real life?\" factor. This isn't your average \"zombie\" book, not at all! These aren't the zombies that you see on TV and in the horror movies; no, these are the Undead...big difference. T.M. Williams wrote this in a way that kept you paying attention. Every now and then I would have to look back to remind myself what had happened previously, and I loved that -- I don't want to just read a book \"numbly\" to get it over with.

This was so creepy!!! This book has your typical mindless, brain-eating, zombie. That's not what's creepy. What's creepy are the totally with-it zombies who know exactly what they're doing when they bite into your soldier, eat your flesh, and drink your blood. They're sadistic, animalistic and they want you. They want to cause you pain and revel in it.
