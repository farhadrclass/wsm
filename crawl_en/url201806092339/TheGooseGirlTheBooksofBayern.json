The characters are really likeable (esp. Geric- I don't think there was enough of him. Every word he said would make a girl smile) I'm classifying this book as strong female because I loved the fact that when Geric wrote Ani off, she was upset and angry, but her world did not collapse (contrast that to Bella in New Moon who did not want to live after Edward left her because that was her sole purpose for being on this earth, please!) I loved that Ani was upset, but had more important things to do than sulk over a guy that didn't work out (like save the Bayern kingdom from a dishonest queen and the Kilendrean kingdom from an impending war!) I think she was more upset about losing her horse than losing Geric. This book has a little bit of everything- suspense, adventure,self discovery,romance, friendship, loyalty, magic, and a happy ending. Ani discovers how powerful she really is, and that she has been all along. My favorite line in the book is a statement about true friendship. When Ani confides to her friend Enna about her true identity, Enna says \"When you get tired of worrying and mourning your horse and trying not to be afraid, tell me and I'll do it for you a while so you can shut your eyes and sleep peaceful.\""}, {"userName": "Sara \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/155288-sara", "userReview": "December 21-22, 2015This book is sooooo fantastic! I love it!June 17-19, 2014I freaking love this book!!!December 24, 2010 - January 2, 2011Not sure what else to say about this book beyond, \"Wow! It's awesome!\". I mean, I've read it SEVERAL times now and just bought it for my sister-in-law for Christmas... I love it!March 9-10, 2010Errr... ditto to what I said before. And now I'm REALLY excited to read Enna Burning just as soon as it gets here through ILL!!April 3, 2009In an Austin Powers voice: \"One million stars...\"It's been a really long time since I added a book to my favorites bookshelf. (It takes quite a special book to earn a spot there, after all... thought it may not LOOK like it to the casual observer...) But I didn't hesitate before adding this one.This is what I think about the book:If someone had told me before I read this book, \"Hey, Sara! You should read this book! It's about a girl who can talk to birds!\" I would have (1) tried really hard not to roll my eyes, (2) smiled and nodded, and (3) never ever picked up the book. Things like that are just.... CHEESY, you know? \"Oooh... Animal whisperer...\"But this book SUCKED me in. Like a really powerful vortex that even the Starship Enterprise could never get out of... (And Captain Janeway got them out of a really bad-ass vortexy-type thing one time.) Usually there's kind of a \"boring\" part of a book\u2014at the beginning.... somewhere in the middle, when it starts dragging... But this book had nonstop suction. (Wow. It sounds like a vacuum cleaner!)ANYWAY, the book sucked me in. It was just so interesting, with its mythology-type stories/legends at the beginning, and then really quickly, she starts her journey toward Bayern... And all along the way CRAP keeps happening to her. Usually books that make you tear-up do so near the end, you know? But this one... it was like 50 pages into the book, and I'm on the verge of tears. The mere fact that I cared enough about the characters only 50 pages in to cry over stuff that's happening to them REALLY speaks highly of the writing, I'd say.So ALL THIS CRAP keeps happening to her, and I'm like, \"Uhhh... Shannon.... I read your Austenland book, and it had a happy ending... If this book doesn't start turning around, I might go jump off a bridge!\" (Nevermind that there aren't any bridges in Bryan other than overpasses...) Parts were just so sad. But it all turned out pretty all right in the end, I'd say. (I can't stop grinning, so that's an understatement...)I was going to say something else... what.... character development. Ani/Isi shows REMARKABLE character development through the course of the book, which is fabulous! From shy, timid, and with an I'll-never-be-as-good-as-my-mother attitude to what she ends up as.... It's great. Just wonderful.Anyway, go read the book. The audiobook was AMAZING!! Produced by Full Cast Audio. It had a different reader for every character! It was fabulous! Like listening to a movie with a narrator!The library's copy of Enna Burning is checked in...

Ani is a young princess with a unique gift, she can speak animal languages. From a very young age she learned to speak to the swan\u2019s in the pond and forged a beautiful connection with a horse foul, Falada. When her father, the king, dies, Ani learns from her mother that she is to be sent off to a neighboring kingdom to be wed to their prince. Along the journey, Ani\u2019s handmaid Selia leads a coup and gets half of Ani\u2019s soldiers to turn against her. Ani flees for her life, and when she finally reaches the kingdom she finds that Selia has assumed her identity, and has all of the guards on her side. Ani becomes the palace goose girl, and she hides in the castle hoping to earn enough money to return home\u2026This book started out very slowly, I had to work hard to get to the point where the plot was moving quickly. It took about 100 pages in until the plot became clear as to where it was going. Once Ani reaches her new kingdom is where the story gets really interesting. She is placed in a new land without any allies and must figure out how to survive. Through the kindness of others, Ani manages to get healthy again, and find a job where she makes new friends. This is a heroine who perseveres when bad things kept happening to her instead of falling apart. Ani is a great role model for young girls because she learned from her experiences and did not give up, she was kind to other people even when they weren\u2019t that nice to her. When finding herself destitute she got a job and earned money instead of turning to others to do it for her or by other less honorable means. This story is a classic case of the good girl wins and the spoiled misbehaving girl loses, a message meant to teach children to be kind and tell the truth and good things will come to you. The romance was sweet and very clean, but not the central point of the story. The most important factor was Ani\u2019s journey of self-discovery and how she became her own person once her princess title was stripped from her. A great fantasy book, and perfect for tween girls.Thanks again to Feifei for all of the great tween recs! :)"}, {"userName": "Tyler", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1453777-tyler", "userReview": "Wow, is all I can say, just plain old flat out wow.

I can't say the same thing for the first half. While reading the first half I felt very bored. I wasn't engaged with the story and honestly thought about dnfing it... but I am glad I did not to that. I do have another problem. I had so much trouble believing that the characters just somehow believed that Ani was who she said she was. Like when she told Enna who she really was Enna didn't doubt her, she instantly believed her, and the same can be said about the other characters except the scene in the end of the book.

I guess if Disney hasn\u2019t already adapted it, I\u2019m more or less clueless when it comes to fairy tales. ;-)That comes in handy, though, when reading a new story \u2014 I figured that Princess Anidori-Kiladra (a.k.a. Ani; a.k.a. Isi, the Goose Girl; a.k.a. the Yellow Lady \u2026 there\u2019s a lot about disguise and identity in this story, if you can\u2019t tell) would live happily ever after \u2014 the heroines always do in fairy tales. Still, I flew through the pages to see what would happen in the meantime. (In a non-spoiler summary, she\u2019s not spared from sorrow, but things still work out for the best.)Hale\u2019s prose is terrific \u2014 poetic and lyrical, easily creating a world where it\u2019s entirely believable that strange and almost-magical things could happen. I loved one of the major themes of the book: that Ani\u2019s unique talents (or even Ani\u2019s so-called \u201cweaknesses,\u201d for she didn\u2019t have the talents which seemed natural to a princess) could be a boon once they were developed. It sounded a lot like a Young Women\u2019s lesson (which probably isn\u2019t too far off, really, as some research revealed that the author is LDS).Great read."}, {"userName": "Lucy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/307208-lucy", "userReview": "Poor Shannon Hale. I think the most frequent comment I've heard about her as an author is, \"She's LDS and like Stephenie Meyer, doesn't write LDS fiction.\" I'm not sure it was a good enough reason to check out her book, Goose Girl, but I did it anyway. My sister, Jen, liked this book and that was one more reason, but a good enough one for me.It was a nice break from some of the meatier stuff I've been reading. It's not meatless, exactly, but written as a fairy tale in the voice of a young princess so it's about as meaty as Chicken Noodle Soup. There are some worthwhile themes throughout the book. Ambition, gifts, honesty, work. The princess, whose name was blessedly shortened to Ani for most of the book, lacks the power of persuasion that her mother, the Queen, possesses. The author calls this gift \"People Speaking\" and while Ani doesn't possess that particular gift, she does possess the rarer, and less esteemed \"Animal Speaking\" and later \"Nature Speaking\" gifts. She can talk to swans, as a girl, and later, while in hiding when her lady-in-waiting pulls a coup during their journey to meet her betrothed, learns to speak to the geese she keeps. Ultimately, she uses these gifts, especially her ability to talk with wind, to restore her place as Crown Princess, leaving us with the lesson that we can rely on the gifts we possess to accomplish what is necessary. I think. At least, that's what I'm taking away from it. A la....To Thine Own Self Be True without all the fancy talk.Those elements create the fairy tale, as well as all the prince and princess stuff, but this felt surprisingly modern to me. There were times the dialogue seemed appropriate to the time of the story, but most of the time, I heard the voices of young, spoiled American teens in my head, especially when the ruthless Selia spoke. In any light, Goose Girl is an easy read, with some sound moral backbone - as fairy tales usually have, but isn't incredible literature - as fairy tales usually aren't. But sometimes, it's nice to simply read a good story. Goose Girl is that."}, {"userName": "Flannery", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/652877-flannery", "userReview": "At first, I was only mildly interested in what was going on in this retelling of a classic fairy tale. However, once the action got started, I really enjoyed listening. The cast was perfect--voices, ages, gender; every voice seemed correct. I think this was/is especially true in terms of the emotional aspects of the characters--I could totally hear it in their voices, which was refreshing.In terms of the story, I really enjoyed the character of Geric. His relationship with Ani, especially when she was the goose girl, was very realistic and I liked the humorous note that Hale wrote into their conversations. Another of my favorite characters was Enna. I am excited to read more and see what happens to her after these events. Though I haven't read the blurb on the back of the second book (I think I'll probably listen to that one too, if it is available), I hope she and Finn get together. ***SPOILER ALERT***A few things that annoyed me about the book:1. Imagine you need to tell someone something. Something that could mean you live or die--how would you go about it when you were facing them and surrounded by people? Would you shout and scream \"Please! Let me say something! Please!\"? Or, perhaps, would you JUST SAY WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY AND STOP YELLING STUPID CRAP? Yeah, I thought so too.2. Imagine you're in the process of discovering that you can hear voices, whether they are from animals or nature. Regardless, if you heard a voice that told you you dropped something in a stream, would you just walk away? Neither would I.3.

However, I was pleasantly surprised to learn that I really loved this story and the characters.Since I am a huge fan of fairy tales, I was worried that Hale wouldn't have done a very good job at writing out a story that was inspired by the fairy tale of the same name. I found that I fell in love with the characters, the story line, the storytelling, and the way the book was written. It was definitely magical to see how Hale managed to breathe life into a fairy tale.I definitely enjoyed going on this adventure with Ani.

Given all the fanfare about Hale, I was sorely disappointed in this novel. The premise is interesting, and the opening chapters are breathtaking. No doubt about it, Hale can write some gorgeous prose, and the story sparkled with possibilities. However, the characters and plot just didn't really develop, in my opinion. It's hard to say much without creating spoilers, so I will say only that I think that, in Hale's mind, Ani (the Goose Girl) developed and grew and changed and came into her own a lot more than was apparent to me. The secondary characters, for the most part, seemed one-dimensional. I was also disappointed in the seeming lack of use of Ani's ability to talk with geese, etc. I guess it just promised a lot, and every time I'd start a chapter I would think, oh, yes, here we go, NOW we are going to flesh out so-and-so character or NOW we are going to see the fruition of Plot Point A...but, no--instead we'd get some repetition of other points. Like a flower bud, there was all the potential but then it never really blossomed. Perhaps since this was Hale's debut novel, she has honed her skills--indeed, I would suspect so since she has since won the Newbery Honor Award. This just reminded me of a first draft of a talented author's novel--it's all clear in the author's head and she thinks she is developing the points well enough, or perhaps really wants to make one point clear and then focuses on that to the point of exhausting it to the detriment of other points. It's not a bad story--I enjoyed it well enough, but I found myself bored and frustrated more times than I was pleased and engrossed. Even so, I think Hale does have a way with words and I will look forward to reading one of her more recent works to enjoy what I imagine will be a more maturely developed story.NOTE OF CAUTION: Although this story is very old-fashioned and seemingly innocent, parents and sensitive readers should be advised that there are a few passages that quite surprised me with their violence--one involving an animal killing and another a story that touches upon rape of village women. It's still a very PG-13 sort, but even so it seemed grossly out of place in this tale."}, {"userName": "C.B.

Ani was always a strange child, she didn\u2019t open her eyes for the first three days after her birth, and her aunt taught her to speak with birds. It\u2019s no wonder her mother didn\u2019t feel that someone who could be considered a witch should sit on the throne. So off Ani goes with her Lady-in-Waiting Selia to be married to the prince of Bayern, in order to bring peace to the two neighboring kingdoms. On her journey, Ani is betrayed by Selia and soon finds herself alone in a foreign land, with Selia\u2019s guards hunting for her and her former Lady-in-Waiting stealing her name. Taking a job as a goose girl (a girl who cares for the king\u2019s geese) puts a roof over her head and allows her to save up money to return home and tell her mother of the betrayal. That is, until she finds out war\u2019s coming and she no longer has time to return home, but must instead take back her name and her heritage to protect her kingdom.This is the first Shannon Hale book that I\u2019ve read, and I now understand why everyone\u2019s been singing her praises. The story was well-crafted and captivating, and I immediately wanted to go out and buy the next two books that take place in this world. Happily, she\u2019s the not the kind of author who feels the need to rehash a finished story, and the other two books are about secondary characters from The Goose Girl, and I look forward to reading them.Here\u2019s another fine book with a strong heroine who didn\u2019t exactly ask for her position, but rose to it none the less. Ani as the Crown Princess never really felt like she could fulfill that role\u2014she simply thought she would have to. When she loses her role as the next ruler of Kildenree, she finds herself unsure of who or what she will become next. Even though she\u2019s betrothed to a prince, she knows she\u2019ll never be the ruler, just the wife of one. Still, she doesn\u2019t really think about all of this until she finds herself alone in the woods without her name or royal identity. She redefines herself, becoming a goose girl and finally stepping up and becoming a princess in action, not just in title. The magic in this book is well worth mentioning. Instead of traditional \u201cwave a magic wand\u201d or have a fairy godmother appear magic, Hale crafts a world of people-speaking, animal-speaking, and nature-speaking. These rare magics allow Queens to command attention and for Ani to learn to talk to the wind. It\u2019s great to see such unique magic woven into an already excellent story. The animal talking was also well crafted; Hale stayed true to the way animals would talk, not letting Ani have long conversations with them, but more getting ideas and things like \u201cdanger\u201d or \u201cgood grazing land\u201d across. The geese were especially well-written, as anyone who\u2019s been around geese knows that they\u2019re both truly evil and incredibly loyal animals. A goose would make a good attack animal for an evil overlord, now that I think about it.Read the rest of my review at Bookwyrm Chrysalis :: YA Fantasy Book Reviews"}, {"userName": "seak", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1805180-seak", "userReview": "This wasn't my typical fare, but I have a friend who loved it and it came highly recommended. She wasn't wrong. The stars I gave it show I liked it, I feel like some people mistake a 3 star rating for disliking a book, but that's ridiculous in my opinion. I'll leave it there.Anyway, I really thought this was a fun and exciting story. The tension was palpable in parts and had me glued to the ... earbuds. It's a clever and fun take on an old tale (apparently, it was new to me). It's full of great characters who are fun to root for with a tense plot that even threw a few surprises at me. This was read by a full ensemble cast, but I'm finding that more and more a full cast isn't for me. There were too many characters that were acted poorly, which really slaps you in the face when you're listening to a wonderful narrator, who does the majority of the narration (Cynthia Bishop = possibly my new favorite narrator). I mean, there was one point where someone literally had one line to read and flubbed it; awkward pause and half-reread of the line and all. And that's not really the problem, just an oversight I'm sure. It was just that there was too much poor acting, including the voice of the main girl, who was only reading the dialogue not the majority of the book luckily. The main issue I had, besides the cast of readers, is that this world doesn't get all that fleshed out. It's so focused on the main girl, the Goose Girl, that it misses any kind of depth with the rest of the world. Now, I understand there had to be reasons for this. It's YA, and fast-paced, and focusing on the world would definitely slow it down. However, I feel like it would have done a whole lot for the hollowness that I was left with in the story. Even an epigraph here and there to shed some light on the rest of the world or a couple more lines here and there to really open up this world would have helped.Overall, I had a great time and it was well worth what little time was required.

The world that Hale has created has that, and more.Imagine a world where you could learn the speech of different animals. You can communicate with them and practically have animal friends. No, it isn\u2019t like talking animals on TV; it\u2019s like, for example, you would understand what a certain bark means, or a honk of a goose. You would understand their body language. And in return, you can talk to them back in their language.Again, imagine that you can hear what the wind is saying. The wind talks about what it has seen and where it is going. You talk back by telling it where to go. IS THAT NOT AMAZING? There is a downside, you see.People-speaking.This is where a person\u2019s words are persuasive to the point that you just agree with them because you \u201cknow: it is right.That is what Anidori-Kiladra Talianna Isilee, Crown Princess of Kildenree has to deal with.Her most trusted friend and hand-maiden has this tricky speech, and wants to take Ani\u2019s crown..And she will do anything to get it.

It seems nothing can beat a true hard-won HEA fairytale style with a nice dramatic showdown."}, {"userName": "Ronyell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1169488-ronyell", "userReview": "\u201cThe Goose Girl\u201d is another brilliant story created by Shannon Hale, who is well known for her first graphic novel book \u201cRapunzel\u2019s Revenge\u201d and it is a much more extended retelling of the classic Brothers Grimm tale \u201cThe Goose Girl\u201d (same title!) that tells the story of how Ani, the true crown princess of Kildenree, is betrayed by her lady-in-waiting and Ani must figure out a way to regain her true name while posing as a goose girl. \u201cThe Goose Girl\u201d is a truly an inspiring story that anyone who is a huge Shannon Hale fan will love for centuries.Wow!!! When I first started reading this book, I thought that it was going to be boring because I must admit that the beginning of this book did have a slow start with little action going on with the main characters. However, when I started reading more into the story, I just started to love this book immensely as the story got more exciting and more emotional as I read through this book. Shannon Hale has done an excellent job at making the characters extremely memorable, especially the main character Ani, who was at first a very passive character who would do anything that anybody told her to do, especially as she easily tries to accept the responsibilities of royalty in Kildenree without thinking about the secrets of her kingdom. However, when Ani\u2019s life is threatened by Selia and Ungolad, Ani becomes a stronger character as the book goes on as she realizes that she is on her own and she must figure out a way to convince the king that she is the real Crown Princess without the aid of her mother. Now, many people may think that Ani is a bit too passive as she easily will do anything that anyone tells her to do, even during her moments of bravery and I do agree to some extent that Ani can be too passive towards other characters. However, when Ani realizes the possibility of having a manipulative person like Selia as princess, Ani goes out of her way to protect the people she love while revealing her own identity about herself that she has never known existed inside of her. I find this revelation that Ani makes about herself extremely reassuring as many people in real life sometimes have problems trying to discover who they truly are and Ani\u2019s character has done a great job at explaining the trials that many people would face whenever they are trying to pluck up the courage to say what is really on their minds. What I loved the most about this book was how Shannon Hale made this book extremely dramatic and exciting at the same time as the audience can feel tension for Ani\u2019s safety and how she is nearly captured by Selia and Ungolad many times in this book. I must admit that there were times that I actually thought that Ungolad, Selia\u2019s guard, would be very close in capturing Ani, even though Shannon Hale makes sure that the audience knows that Ani does everything in her power to escape her captors.\u201cThe Goose Girl\u201d is truly a fantastic book about the power of courage and discovering who you truly are on the inside that many people who also want to discover the courage to stand up for what they believe in, can easily enjoy for many years.Review is also on: Rabbit Ears Book Blog"}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/446509-ann", "userReview": "I think this is going to be a very difficult review to write. I did enjoy the book - in parts - but overall I was underwhelmed and left feeling that the book could have been so much better.At times, Hale's writing was very poetic, painting a vibrant picture in her unique and fluid style. At other times, it felt redundant, and time was spent on unimportant descriptions.I liked the characters, but wanted more from them. I liked the plot, but felt all \"the good stuff\" was never explored. I felt as though I understood where Hale was trying to take the story, where the intent was meant to lead, but I felt I had to take myself there, and it was up to me to fill in the gaps. Also, the story itself is really cute in parts: a defiant goose who adores Ani? Sweet! A loyal horse who understands Ani's inner feelings? Enchanting. But some of the story is really quite unnerving and, though the descriptions aren't really gruesome, I felt they didn't fit with the rest of the story. Like I said, I did *like* the characters, but more for what was implied than actually written. I believe we were to understand that the characters grew, became stronger, more assured, but I never really saw much of it. And while I think each character was supposed to be unique in their own right, there wasn't much that separated one from the other.But, I still feel the story is worth three stars because, for whatever reason, I was always curious to read the next chapter, always curious to see what exactly would transpire. It's just that, more than not, the book didn't live up to my hopes. It felt more like a great first draft that needed further development. But, it is a fairly unique twist on a fairy-tale-ish story, and I give Hale credit for her ingenuity. I just would have liked even more. And, I am curious to read the sequel, and other of Hale's work.*****Here's goes! I've been really anxious to read this:)"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "The Goose Girl (The Books of Bayern #1), Shannon Hale"}, {"userName": "Alexandra Bracken", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2276707-alexandra-bracken", "userReview": "This book is impossibly sweet and wonderful.

Shannon Hale has created a detailed world in which some of the odd details of the original fairy tale are reworked and make much more sense.

This book. Beautiful. Magical. I don't even know where to begin, or what exactly I adored the most about it. I finally narrowed down my thoughts into 5 points as to why I loved this book so much.1. I loved how the lovely Miss Shannon Hale chose to adapt one of the  lesser known of Grimms' fairy tales  - to be honest, I had no idea there  was  a fairy tale called the Goose Girl until I read this book - but this tale is such a dark and yet uplifting one, it truly deserves to be shared with more people. It's also just such a breath of fresh air to not read yet another Cinderella or Snow White retelling. 2. The magic system of this world: The gifts of people-speaking, animal-speaking, nature-speaking - I can't even form words, it was so unique, so  beautiful  to read about, it was just delightful, honestly. 3. The characterization - Ani's transformation throughout her journey, and the people she met along the way, all of them were flesh-and-blood characters in their own right, unique, and with a story to tell. 4. The writing in general was  wonderful . Beautiful. Haunting. Hopeful. Magical. I'm gushing, I know, just let me. 5. Finally (although I'm sure I could keep on going) Falada. I just. I loved this character so much. His role in this tale added a depth that was just breathtaking. This. BOOK. Guys - do yourself a favor, and read it. It truly touched my heart. I recommend it to everyone."}], "description": "When an imposter takes her place at the royal wedding, Princess Anidori Kiladra of Kildenree struggles to regain not only her crown, but her very name.", "title": "The Goose Girl\n      \n          (The Books of Bayern #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1870748.The_Goose_Girl", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347714314l/1870748.jpg", "reviews": 9176, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/49177.Shannon_Hale", "name": "Shannon Hale"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Fantasy", "Romance", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1870748.The_Goose_Girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179064.The_Goose_Girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2689941-the-goose-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2986869-the-goose-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31450673-the-goose-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/444323.The_Goose_Girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1332982.The_Goose_Girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/85990.Princess_Academy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248483.Austenland", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248484.Book_of_a_Thousand_Days", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248482.Enna_Burning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/248470.River_Secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
