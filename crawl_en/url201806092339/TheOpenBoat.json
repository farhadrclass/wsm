Crane addresses the existential crisis of man in such a poignant manner, that it's difficult to let go of the overwhelming and conflicting sensation of being understood and still being helpless that this story resonates.We are so small. We are so ignorant. Does our insignificance outweigh our importance? When facing nature, our greatest adversary, who do we rely on but the brotherhood of mankind? In just a few pages of irony and metaphors, Crane gives one of those stories that will stay- because this story so eloquently addresses both the shortcomings and strengths of man and the eternal question that haunts us when we are most awake: what is the point?I guess this story really lights up one of the most important reasons we read: to know that we aren't alone. Crane's message about the gift of society actually renders true here then. I want to hug him.Also, Crane gave me a quote to obsess over, cry about and cherish:\"When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important,and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him,he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeplythe fact that there are no brick and no temples.\"Wow."}, {"userName": "Amina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5079848-amina", "userReview": "This is the story of four men, a wounded captain, an oiler, a correspondant and a cook who spent three days in icy waters in a ten-foot tall dinghy after a shipwreck .

Crane (1871-1900) is not a \"Buried\" writer, but he is a forgotten, neglected one, which is a pity. His simple, objective --  detached  -- writing influenced Hemingway. Did anyone remember Crane when Hem published in the '20s ? (No!) ~ Clearly, Crane is a key American voice, but I wonder if he's even read in college lit classes today --such being the fickleness and dumbness of academia. (Just scan some GR reviews). In less than 50 pages, Crane captures the loneliness, desperation and trauma of being \"lost at sea\" -- with land in sight. As a reporter Crane himself was enroute to Cuba (yes, there are always problems  there ) when this happened to him. He keeps you in the dinghy: there's no exposition or \"back story\" for the 4.This story, along w others, can be found in a Collected Crane x Dover...but the print is crammed together and I refuse to take an eye test while reading anything. I bought as a single. Crane is another American Original like Jack London. We haven't had any in over 50 years. His story here is a metaphor for the Ordeal of Life. Some survive.

Four men are at sea in a lifeboat after the floundering of their ship, a captain, an oiler, a cook and a correspondent. We follow their efforts to get to shore after they have spotted land but while being kept offshore by a reef that blocks their entry. There is sorrow, fear, frustration, and desperation. The indifference of nature to their situation and the feeling that they are just specs in the ocean, unimportant to anyone and to God, grows as they continue to struggle against what seems to be their fate.\"IF I am going to be drowned -- if I am going to be drowned -- if I am going to be drowned, why, in the name of the seven mad gods, who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?\" Some of the things I believe Crane wants us to contemplate when we read this story: Why do we live? If death is the ultimate, unavoidable consequence of life, why do we live at all? Do we matter in the scheme of things? If we are so insignificant, what importance can our lives have? How cruel is hope in the face of the inevitable? Is it better to see a shore you cannot reach or to die searching for it? And, finally, who deserves to survive? Why do some of us arbitrarily endure while others, just as deserving, perish?Finally, the correspondent recalls a poem he recited, with complete indifference, in school.A soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,There was lack of woman's nursing, there was dearth of woman'stears;But a comrade stood beside him, and he took that comrade's handAnd he said: \"I shall never see my own, my native land.\" For the first time, he contemplates the soldier as a man, as a person losing his life on a foreign shore, a man just like himself; and he feels the connection, the connection to everyman. One cannot imagine that he will resume his indifference to the fate of others. Perhaps the meaning of this experience is the rare opportunity to see yourself as part of a whole, as one, but as one of many."}, {"userName": "Paloma Meir", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36085050-paloma-meir", "userReview": "If I am going to be drowned, if I am going to be drowned, if I am going to be drowned, why, in the name of the seven mad gods who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees?That was some powerful writing I just read.

But after reading \"The Open Boat,\" it seems I'd forgotten exactly how powerful a writer Crane really was.I've never quite shared in the ultimate philosophy of writers like London, Conrad, and Crane yet they perpetually rank among my favorites, mainly I think, because the masculine vocabulary and narrative of \"naturalist\" deism (and sometimes atheism) speaks so well to those like myself who are or have been in constant contact with the dangers of outdoor life and work; those who know that their fate rests primarily in their own hands; those who know that one slip-up could cost them not simply their daily meal but their very lives. The \"naturalist\" relies upon the observation that although there may be a \"grand architect\" behind all that we see in this world, he/she/it is indifferent to our cares. It is not an agnosticism, but really that the idea that revelation, miracles, or any type of divine relationship between man and his creator is nonexistant. It is the belief that in nature, we are at the mercy only of our own abilities. How Crane came to hold such views, especially at such a young age, I can't comprehend, yet they are very evident in \"The Open Boat\" and it makes for extraordinarily beautiful though lonely sentiment:\"...During this dismal night, it may be remarked that a man would conclude that it was really the intention of the seven mad gods to drown him, despite the abominable injustice of it. For it was certainly an abominable injustice to drown a man who had worked so hard, so hard. The man felt it would be a crime most unnatural. Other people had drowned at sea since galleys swarmed with painted sails, but still --When it occurs to a man that nature does not regard him as important, and that she feels she would not maim the universe by disposing of him, he at first wishes to throw bricks at the temple, and he hates deeply the fact that there are no bricks and no temples. Any visible expression of nature would surely be pelleted with his jeers.Then, if there be no tangible thing to hoot he feels, perhaps, the desire to confront a personification and indulge in pleas, bowed to one knee, and with hands supplicant, saying: \"Yes, but I love myself.\"A high cold star on a winter's night is the word he feels that she says to him. Thereafter he knows the pathos of his situation...\"Crane does not entirely discount that miracles happen, just that they are rather rare natural turns of luck that few men are fortunate to witness or partake in. Near the end of the story, when rescue is at hand, a wave carries the \"correspondent\" over the capsized boat, he makes it a point to call this \"a miracle of the sea.\"However, Crane does give some hope in the story that even if we are at the mercy of nature, we are still worthy of survival because in the end we are capable of saving each other. For there are men, like the captain in the dinghy, that can still exhibit a duty toward other men as regards their cold station in life, and he paints a near messianic picture of his selflessness as he stood in the water with \"a halo on his head\" and shining \"like a saint.\"I never did nor will I agree with the basis of deism/naturalism but it makes for incredible literature. 4.5 stars and another look at Stephen Crane."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31533844-sarah", "userReview": "\"If I am going to be drowned-- if I am going to be drowned-- if I am going to be drowned, why, in the name of the seven mad gods, who rule the sea, was I allowed to come thus far and contemplate sand and trees? Was I brought here merely to have my nose draged away as I was about to nibble the sacred cheese of life?\"When I was going through the majority of Stephen Crane's works a few months ago, I somehow never read this even though I probably had the opportunity. I think I got tired of him after a while. So about 15 minutes ago, I was sitting at my computer thinking about Crane and realizing that I had never read \"The Open Boat\", which is undoubtedly one of his most well-known short stories. So, you know what? I just read this and I do not regret it. I never thought that I could come across another work by Crane that is as marvelous as The Red Badge of Courage- since he disappointed me with some of his other works, I never thought that this could work for me. But it did, and I'm really glad about that. Sometimes, reading on a whim pays off.More than anything, \"The Open Boat\" is a psychological exploration of four men who are stranded in a faulty, leaky boat. Interestingly enough, the tone is jovial enough (with some pretty damned funny quips- that stuff about the sacred cheese of life is so funny) for the first portion of the story, but as time goes by, more and more anxiety, fear, and acceptance of death come into play, finishing off with the shock of not actually dying. The plot merely seems to revolve around the psyche of the characters and the tension of the situation, so it is simple and pliable. This formula is one that could fall apart at the drop of a pin for some authors, but Crane seems to be a master at really getting inside the skin of fictional characters. As a final note, I have actually heard that \"The Open Boat\" is actually based on a real near-death experience that Crane had, which just makes it all better for me. In comparison to Red Badge, which is based on n event that Crane never had to experience, \"The Open Boat\" is based on real feelings and real fears, which may just make this my new favorite work by this particular author."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9862202-sarah", "userReview": "So elegantly written.

Throughout the whole book I felt like there was no point to the entire book overall. The only time anything that happened actually mattered was at the end. Glad that it was just a short story.Plot: Men are sitting in a boat. The waters are very rough. Two men are stuck rowing, The Oiler and The Correspondant. The Captain stands defeated and broken because the whole trip looks like a loss. He holds hope long enough to see a lighthouse in the distance. This gives all the men hope to push through the waves. They did not want to make it this far to just die. Characterization: The Captain felt completely defeated at the beginning of the story. It seemed as if the entire ocean is working against them. He tried not to let his men see his loss of hope. Seeing the lighthouse in the distance made him change his whole lookout on their situation.Recommendation: It's just another short story.

When they come to a barrier of fallen trees and branches they notice spear points protruding from the tangle. Slowly the face of Wang appears as the spears retract into the jungle, but Wang is holding a gun, Heyst's gun. No understanding can be made between Heyst and Wang and Wang slips back into the dark jungle and the spear points slowly emerge once more from the jungle.What does that scene have to do with this story by Crane? Nature's indifference to man, even in the face of crisis. Crane writes \"A high cold star on a winter's night is the word he feels that she says to him\", but what does this mean? Who is \"she\"? How is a cold star also a word? This is a very unusual sentence but it almost perfectly explains how indifferent nature is, how impossible it is to find meaning in the universe, how far away the light is (metaphorically and literally), how lonely and insignificant we are in the totality of the universe, how nature isn't actually telling us anything but rather we are just observing something totally indifferent to us and trying our best to interpret it. This is the sort of sentence Joseph Conrad would have written, and it's why it reminded me of the scene in 'Victory' which makes a very similar point.And nature is brutal, too. As Werner Herzog says in the film \"Grizzly Man\", \"And what haunts me, is that in all the faces of all the bears that Treadwell ever filmed, I discover no kinship, no understanding, no mercy. I see only the overwhelming indifference of nature.\" Crane also explores this brutality with the shark that swims below the boat, always circling, and always ever seen by just one of the men at a time - though they are all aware of its presence. But Crane also recognizes that even this brutality is beautiful, just as Treadwell in 'Grizzly Man' saw beauty in the bears. Crane describes what we can see of the shark as \"a gleaming trail of phosphorescence, like a blue flame\", and earlier he paints the color of the ocean as \"changed from slate to emerald-green, streaked with amber lights, and the foam was like tumbling snow\".Finally there is a similarity with Tolstoy's \"The Death of Ivan Ilyich\" in that we get in both stories characters that question the point of all this suffering. Tolstoy writes, \"'Why these sufferings?' And the voice answered, 'For no reason -- they just are so.'\" and here Crane writes \"Was I brought here merely to have my nose dragged away as I was about to nibble the sacred cheese of life?\"But unlike Herzog and Conrad, Crane and Tolstoy seem to be somewhat more optimistic. Ivan Ilyich comes to find peace in the end and Billie, the corespondent, believes that after his terrible ordeal that he has a better understanding of life and death, he feels he can interpret the voice of an indifferent nature (a high cold star) to those of us still living and looking for meaning but who cannot yet comprehend universal indifference. And what we can find is some comfort among each other that way. This is a remarkable story, beautifully written, frightening in its theme, and dramatic start to finish."}, {"userName": "Riah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68273795-riah", "userReview": "I think The Open Boat was a nice story.

It's mostly straightforward, and doesn't have much plot, and that's why I didn't love it. I am a teen, and lots of teens like plot. I'm sure this book has many literary aspects that I don't understand because I'm not an English teacher. However this was a quick read, and didn't waste much time at all, so it's pretty good. Plot Summary:There's a correspondent, an oiler, a captain, and a cook. They start off on a tiny boat, and need to find land. The people on the boat were part of a crew. After making a sort of sail with an overcoat, they see some land. Later, they see a guy waving to them with his jacket. However, they didn't know what he was trying to tell them, and just set sail for another land mass. Once they have expelled a large amount of energy trying to find more land, they finally do. It takes a large struggle to do it, but eventually they get onto the shore and get help.Recommendation: I would recommend this book to somebody who needs to read a book in school for an assignment or something. It doesn't take long to read, about an hour of your time. As for the demographic that reads this type of literature, I do not know.

Eventually they make it to shore, all but one who dies while they all swim for the shore."}], "description": "Four men struggle for survival after escaping from a sinking ship and into a small open boat.", "title": "The Open Boat", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1778663.The_Open_Boat", "average": 3.65, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1329146523l/1778663.jpg", "reviews": 157, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/19879.Stephen_Crane", "name": "Stephen Crane"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Classics", "Fiction", "Literature", "Academic"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1778663.The_Open_Boat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23569310-o-salva-vidas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13815568-the-open-boat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19404860-the-open-boat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6078125-the-open-boat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21505530-the-open-boat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35220.The_Red_Badge_of_Courage", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2918374-the-red-badge-of-courage-and-selected-short-fiction", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/208977.Maggie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40209.Maggie", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/179073.The_Open_Boat_and_Other_Stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
