The time period of this novels covers a bit of World War I, then the years between the wars, and then World War II. (So many wars!) So in a sense it is partly a prequel to her great novel Suite Francaise but also a continuation of it. It is set in the same village outside of Paris as was Suite. Surely she is one of the absolute best writers about war \u2013 not in the sense of the \u2018front\u2019 \u2013 there are no battle scenes \u2013 but in terms of how war impacts the home life of the women, children and old men left behind. The first men called up and the first deaths of men in the village were a big thing; then people got used to it. I\u2019m reminded of a scene in The Rebels by Sandor Marai when the first bodies of war dead returning to a town in Hungary by train were met by a village band, priests, a political committee and speeches; toward the end of the war they were met by two men with a donkey cart to take the body to the cemetery. There is a lot about the terror of the generation that fought WW I, truly believing it to be the \u201clast war,\u201d survived the depression that followed, and now realize their error and wait for WW II to start. \u201cEveryone waited for the war to start the way people wait for death: knowing it is inevitable, asking only for a little more time.\u201dThe plot revolves around social class. A man owns the only factory in town and employs most of the townspeople as workers. He rules the factory and the town with an iron fist. He is the 1%. He has hand-selected a young man from a \u201cgood family\u201d to marry his daughter and inherit the factory and his wealth. But the young man breaks the engagement and marries his true love instead, earning him the perpetual ire of the old man. The old man\u2019s daughter takes over the management of the factory and she is seeking revenge. The plot gets even more complicated a generation later when the old man\u2019s granddaughter (daughter of the spurned lover) falls in love with the son of the man who spurned her. And the old man is still around spewing his hate! Of course WW II punctuates all this; the town is destroyed by the Germans; the factory has to be rebuilt; the would-have-been son-in-law is wounded in the war. There is a lot about traditions and class. After autos arrive, the rich don\u2019t walk after dark, so they take a car to neighbors across the street.Sometimes women didn\u2019t see their husbands or sons for 30 months. Letters were intermittent, so you never knew\u2026 I\u2019m reminded of a scene in Dreams of My Russian Summers by Andrei Makine where his grandmother received an official letter telling her of the death of her husband in a battle. A year later she received another letter telling her that her husband died recently in another battle at another location. At that point she simply KNOWS he is alive --- this is just bureaucratic bungling \u2013 and she\u2019s right \u2013 he comes home at the end of the war! A bit about the oddity of the translation of the title that is talked about in the introduction. Long story short: I think it should be translated as \u201cThe Good Things of Life\u201d because that is the point of it --- carrying on and surviving and enjoying life despite wars and deaths of loved ones. The author tells us that as men get exhausted in battle they lose their individuality and come to feel that what is important is that the good things of life will carry on even if THEY themselves will not be around to enjoy them. Some passages I liked: \u201cThey went through the motions of living, without truly believing they were alive.\u201d\u201cThe whiff of danger excites the elderly, imbues them with strength; except when it doesn\u2019t have the opposite effect of killing them with anxiety.\u201d\u201cOnce the ceremony [a funeral] was over, everyone went back home, back to the warm fire and set table with that feeling of comfort and joy you have after a long walk in the rain, or when you\u2019ve buried someone whose life and death are equally meaningless to you.\u201d Life and love go on despite war. That is the message of this book. If only Irene Nemirovsky had lived to see the end of the second war. She was murdered at Auschwitz in 1942 when she was 39.top photo of a village in Brittany from fodors.comphoto of the author from Wikipedia"}, {"userName": "Maria Clara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46308842-maria-clara", "userReview": "Sinceramente, no s\u00e9 qu\u00e9 le ha faltado para que no le d\u00e9 las cinco estrellas.

Read this review anyway.All Our Worldly Goods feels contemporary and Tolstoyesque all at once. The characters are sketched rather than painted in oil, and the humor is gorgeous and easily missed if you read too quickly. For instance:Sitting comfortably, without her corset, her arms and legs bare and relaxed, out in the fresh air, in the sunshine, she felt extremely peaceful; she felt happy, as if she had everything she could wish for. She had a husband she loved, the best son in the world. The paper factory was flourishing. Her mother-in-law was dead. Pierre was making an excellent marriage.How gorgeous to slip in that next-to-last item like that.The same bluntness permeates the book in brilliant gems of sentences like this one: She had reached the age where you recoil at the idea of any kind of change, as if it were an omen of the greatest change of all: death.I should have loved this book. And I did. But I also had a hard time reading it.What made this book difficult for me is that it's exactly what its cover claims: \"a novel of love between the wars.\" Nemirovsky writes as if she were simply an exceptionally observant, sharp-witted French woman sketching out the lives of a couple who are required to witness two wars. The novel ends as World War II begins. Germany has just begun to occupy France. And yet the book ends on a beatific note: She had gathered in all the good things of this world, and all the bitterness, all the sweetness of the earth had borne fruit. They would live out the rest of their days together.Fair enough. But Nemirovsky was killed in the war she never mentions in her novel, the other war being waged by the Germans: the war against the Jews. She finished this book in 1940; in 1942, she was murdered in Auschwitz. Nemirovsky saw herself as a French writer. France and Germany saw her as a Jew. She and her husband, far from living out their days together, died separately in the Holocaust. Their two very young daughters narrowly escaped the same fate.Given how eagerly France worked with the Nazis to murder their own citizens, it was wrenching for to me to read a \"French\" novel by one of their victims. It's not Nemirovsky's words, but their context, that make this novel strangely terrifying."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78921-heather", "userReview": "This is a sweet, sad, nostalgic, and unexpectedly uplifting tale of love in the turmoil of the two world wars. It put me a lot in the mind of William Trevor\u2019s Fools of Fortune \u2013 although this book was, I think, significantly less tragic, it shares a lot of the same themes of families that seemingly can\u2019t help but be entangled by births, marriages, and deaths, and of people \u2013 particularly young people \u2013 whose lives are swept up by forces they cannot control. Reading this book, you feel the horrible and wonderful sweep of history and fate. Wonderful in that love, however embattled, seems to find its home over and over again in this book (lovers find each other, children are born, people are forgiven) \u2013 horrible in that the modern reader knows the devastation of each world war looming around the corner. Knowing, too, that Nemirovsky herself was a victim of the holocaust \u2013 she died in a concentration camp in 1942 \u2013 I felt her own death looming as the events of the book marched steadily towards the second world war. The reader feels the weight of the war and its impact not just on the main characters, but on the world \u2013 or at least on France. But even as such huge, sweeping events set the tone \u2013 and much of the course \u2013 of the book, Nemirovsky\u2019s writing is still tenderly evocative of the individual experience.The author has a substantial gift for understanding people and writing convincingly and compassionately about their emotions and experiences. Even with characters that are selfish, or cruel, or dishonest, Nemirovsky writes with an understanding eye. It\u2019s easy to present the big brute of the family who rules the roost; it\u2019s not easy to show the reader why they are the way they are, and even make you sympathize with them a little.Nemirovsky uses simple language to capture the strange core of life and love \u2013 one favorite passage, though short and simple, is Charles Hardelot\u2019s titular line:\u201cI place the happiness of these children in the hands of Providence, but I know how fate defines happiness, in its divine wisdom: worry, anxiety, endurance, our worldly goods\u2026\u201dI\u2019m not sure in this passage if Charles means that worry, anxiety, endurance, etc become a necessary part of love, because they are a necessary part of life, as love weaves itself through hardship \u2013 or if happiness and love cost \u201call our worldly goods.\u201d Or, as T.S. Eliot would say, \u201ccosting not less than everything.\u201d I haven\u2019t read Suite Francaise, but I feel that All Our Worldly Goods definitely stands on its own. I\u2019m excited to own this book and look forward to rereading it, especially reading it aloud with my husband. I can\u2019t recommend this book enough."}, {"userName": "arcobaleno", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9951082-arcobaleno", "userReview": "Un\u2019altra guerra.

This novel was absolutely beautiful as all of her works, with its lyrical mood of France caught up between the two wars and the setting that just comes alive in front of your eyes. Married against their parents\u2019 will, Pierre and Agnes are a perfectly happy couple, but the times, just like the rigid mindset of the ancestral town from which they come, will do seemingly everything possible and impossible to ruin their happiness. Irene Nemirovsky is known for writing the most beautiful and profound family sagas, and this novel was not an exception. Each character was presented with incredible vividness: the patriarch of the family with his obsession of lifestyle that is slowly slipping away from his grip; a vindictive former fianc\u00e9 who still holds a grudge against her former beloved; a son who nearly kills himself after his mistress leaves him for another man, and many more. The mood of war-torn France is delivered with painstaking precision, just like the traditional family mindset that ruled over many households in the beginning of the 20th century. The new generation and their ideas create the contrast, through which another brewing war is shown - a more vicious one. If you love historical fiction you should definitely pick up Nemirovsky\u2019s books. I have two more on my list and I can\u2019t wait to get to them.

Il fragore, il frastuono delle guerre si spegneranno. Il resto rimane... Per me o per qualcun altro?\u00bb descrivendo \"in presa diretta\" l'invasione tedesca e quell'esodo di massa delle popolazioni francesi dalle loro case, esodo che lei stessa aveva vissuto in prima persona, ma gi\u00e0 parlando di ricostruzione e mai, mai una sola volta, di odio o di rancore; con uno stile pi\u00f9 misurato, meno tagliente del solito, ma ugualmente diretto e avvolgente, forse necessario a creare una sorta di equilibrio interno con quanto stava vivendo, senza dimenticare di ricordare che, per la prima volta in un suo romanzo, forse anche in conseguenza della sua contingente conversione al cattolicesimo, non erano pi\u00f9 solo l'autodeterminazione e il libero arbitrio a guidare - in questo caso - le azioni delle famiglie di Pierre Hardelot e di Agn\u00e9s Florent in un romanzo corale che intreccer\u00e0 le vite dei due protagonisti con quella di Simone Renaudin, attraversando tre generazioni e due guerre, ma anche l'intervento della Provvidenza, cui Ir\u00e8ne sembra affidare non solo la vita dei suoi personaggi, ma anche se stessa e il destino della Francia. Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky ha il dono e la capacit\u00e0 di sublimare con la sua prosa ogni singola frase, ogni pensiero, di far sentire chi legge al centro della storia, ma soprattutto di farlo entrare in sintonia con i suoi personaggi, ai quali attribuisce, senza filtri, anche quei pensieri che noi, talvolta, censuriamo in noi stessi.Non riesco pi\u00f9 a leggere Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky senza legare ai suoi romanzi gli eventi della sua vita, a provare una tristezza infinita per la sua fine, a pensare con quanta frenesia abbia cercato di sollecitare la concessione della cittadinanza francese per s\u00e9 e per il marito, a come fremesse di rabbia per le limitazioni imposte alla propria attivit\u00e0 di scrittrice, a come si sia ingegnata per aggirare le restrizioni e pubblicare ad ogni costo e \"ovunque\" quello che scriveva, a come non si sia rassegnata all'inerzia e abbia combattuto fino alla fine, animata da una forza interiore pi\u00f9 simile al furore che alla paura.Chiss\u00e0, forse avr\u00e0 pensato che anche per lei, come per Agn\u00e9s, sarebbe arrivato infine, non quello che molti definiscono \"il lieto fine\" del romanzo, ma quella lieta fine che le avrebbe permesso finalmente, senza pi\u00f9 dolore n\u00e9 fatica, di godere dei doni della vita. \u00abMa Agnes non avvertiva pi\u00f9 n\u00e9 dolore n\u00e9 fatica.

Then again, I had a similar impression from Nemirovsky's Suite Francaise, and that one I read in print.However, in spite of the bleakness, the story is a worthwhile read. I haven't read anything about WWI and WWII from the perspective of a civilian living in or around Paris, so close to the battlefronts and so accustomed to having their town destroyed and rebuilt and destroyed and rebuilt. I had also not really considered what it would have been like for fathers who fought in WWI to see their sons go off to WWII, it was only 20 years later. And how hard it would have been that this second time around there were no false hopes, no flowers and cheers for the departing soldiers, because after growing up on the dreadful stories of the first war, they knew too well the awful reality that was before them.On a human level, the petty quarrels of a provincial town are not especially entertaining, and yet they are very human, and in her characters Nemirovsky manages an objective balance between the human capacity for contrariness and selfishness and also for generosity and magnanimity.I am happy to have read this book which has broadened my perspective and helped me understand more about what the generations before me went through.

A Jewess, born in Russia at the turn of the twentieth century, Irene's family fled from Russia and resettled in France. Falling in love with France, Irene converted to Catholicism and considered it her home. She became a famous author, writing powerful and successful novels. All of this would not be enough to save her from the Nazis. During World War II, she was arrested and sent to Auschwitz, where she died.I fell for her writing when I read Suite Francaise several years ago. Written during the war and published posthumously by her daughters, Suite Francaise describes life for the French during World War II. She is a talented writer with a gift for creating absolutely honest and believable characters. It's almost as if she is simply telling the reader about the neighbors she watches out her kitchen window. Yet, rather than just the voyeuristic reporter, she also understands and conveys their truly human desires, flaws and strengths.I was anxious to read another novel by Irene Nemirovsky and was delighted to have the privilege to read and review All Our Worldly Goods. Published in French, the novel has been translated into English and is now being published in the United States.As with Suite Francaise, in All Our Worldly Goods Nemirovsky again writes an elegant and beautiful book. Pierre and Agnes fall in love with each other in spite of the marriages their parents have carefully arranged for them. Breaking tradition and risking falling out of favor with family, they decide to marry each other. In brief snippets, Nemirovsky tells a family saga and how their brash and yet passionate decision will affect the generations. Her story and plot are so carefully planned that it rings absolutely true. The love between Pierre and Agnes will survive two wars. Nemirovsky is at her greatest when describing the emotions of the French as they must evacuate their cities, yet again, as they are defeated by the Germans in the early years of World War II. Since she personally lived through this experience, she is in the unique position as observer and reporter. As I read the novel, my heart ached for the discouraged people who couldn't believe that they would see two great wars in one lifetime. Who simply didn't believe they could go on.Yet, in all the pain and depression of the war, Nemirovsky shows in her novels that life continues--people are born and die. They love and they live.Tragically, Nemirovsky was killed. We should be thankful that her powerful and beautiful work lives on."}, {"userName": "Saretta", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3547950-saretta", "userReview": "Gli eventi narrati ne \u201cI doni della vita\u201d coprono il periodo da prima della 1\u00b0 guerra mondiale fino all\u2019invasione dei tedeschi in Francia negli anni \u201940.L\u2019autrice \u00e8 riuscita a raccontare alcuni grandi eventi della storia tramite gli occhi \u2013 e la vita quotidiana \u2013 di alcuni abitanti di un villaggio francese.E protagonista di questo romanzo \u00e8 la vita quotidiana: fatta di sentimenti ricambiati, di gelosie, di litigi, di svaghi e di doveri.

In both books Nemirovsky's writing is incredibly beautiful and gracefully poignant. Though the original French must be even better, these translations by Sandra Smith are wonderful.Nemirovsky was killed at Auschwitz before she could finish Suite Fran\u00e7aise, but All Our Worldly Goods is a complete novel. It's set in France from 1911, just before the start of WWI, to 1940, shortly after the beginning of WWII, and it tells the tangled story of three families from a small village. Pierre Hardelot's family owns the village factory and at the opening of the book he is set to do what his family wants and marry Simone Renaudin, an orphaned and wealthy heiress. To the shock of all he breaks off this engagement to marry for love. Agnes Florent's family were only brewers, so while the Florents and the Hardelots are friendly no one expected them to be united by a wedding. Pierre's rejection of Simone and devoted love for Agnes start a family feud whose ramifications continue as the world is upended and their village is destroyed by war, painstakingly reconstructed and then razed by war again.All Nemirovsky's characters are well-drawn rounded individuals, sometimes selfish but deeply loving, neither heroes or villains. They have had to rebuild their lives before, so while the novel ends with WWII still raging the tone of the book is more hopeful than despairing."}, {"userName": "Kiki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/612857-kiki", "userReview": "My Amazon review, ARCI know this book was originally published in 1947, but it is completely new to American readers. If you loved any of Ir\u00e8ne N\u00e9mirovsky's other books (I've read and loved Suite Francaise and Fire in the Blood) you should also LOVE this beauty of a book.If Ms N\u00e9mirovsky had survived the war, I imagine she would have become a most powerful writer. Her observations of life and love, especially in times of hardship and distress are very astute and well crafted. I'm sure this also has something to do with the excellent work of translator Sandra Smith, who should be given credit for translating the poetic prose of N\u00e9mirovsky into a lovely English language novel, yet still true to its author's intentions, I'm sure.The story is of two French Provincial families, and they truly embody the meaning of the word \"provincial.\" Before the start of World War 1, the Hardelot and Florents families both lived idyllic and worry free lives. Their biggest concern was marrying off their children to just the right person: arranged marriages were still attempted, but in the case of these families from the small town of Saint Elme, the arrangements fall through. The elders of the families struggle to regain the control they have exerted over the children, but war and passion rip anyone's control of their quiet lives away from them.N\u00e9mirovsky's character studies are contemporary and universal, very appealing.

In the town of Saint-Elme, Pierre escapes his family-approved engagement to Simone in order to marry his true love, Agnes. Pierre, Agnes, and their son, Guy, are disowned by Pierre's grandfather, the town's rich and powerful factory owner, but they make their own lives. Pierre survives fighting in WWI to return to Agnes, only to see history repeated when WWII breaks out as Guy comes of age.

It is a complete novel, unlike SF, which was never finished, and it is beautifully crafted and written. It follows a small village in France, a couple and two interconnected families from just prior to WWI through to the commencement of WWII, and provides deep insight into the minds, mores and lifestyles of the French bourgouise class at that time. It is a scathing condemnation of the French upper/middle class in many ways, delivered with a velvet touch by Irene Nemirovsky, a native Russian Jew who grew up in France and died in Auschwitz. I was also reminded of what I recently read in Jeff Shaara's \"To the Last Man\" about how war was perceived as glorious and noble prior to the horrors of WWI; this book captures the French civilian mindset at just the time when that perception was being brutally overturned.

It spanned several decades (yes, as told in the book description), but I was disappointed when each chapter found the characters in a new year, a new situation...but without necessarily finishing up what had happened in the previous chapter. Too jumpy.For being a tale of love between Agnes & Pierre, I found an in-depth look at these two characters lacking. I felt that there was much more focus on their families and the trials & tribulations they were going through, as opposed to what Agnes & Pierre were feeling. Brief glimpses into the main couple's love and emotions were not enough for me, sorry.Worth the read, but wish it could have been longer/more in depth, or something.
