What a fresh character and what a fresh middle grade voice!On the outside, Molly is struggling to deal with a long-distance mom, a vulnerable younger brother, and a best friend in danger of moving away. But on the inside, she's struggling with something much more difficult. And scary.Because if she can't keep every single little thing in order, her whole world will devolve into chaos. And she'd better keep that struggle to herself or everyone will think she's weird. Or crazy.FINDING PERFECT is not only an engaging middle grade read, but also an important book that spotlights OCD and its painful effects.

So many feelings!Main character Molly will tug at your heartstrings right off the bat. She's incredibly sweet and well-intentioned and I spent most of the book wanting to give her the biggest hug on the planet. I think so many people - kids and adults - will be able to relate to Molly and her struggles. Throughout the book, she feels 'crazy' for various reasons but isn't able to open up to close friends/family members because she's scared of what they'll think. Though not everyone can relate to having OCD, I think many people will be able to relate to that feeling, to that stress and fear of sharing something deeply personal for the first time, even if you're sharing with someone who will love you no matter what. Five enthusiastic stars for this wonderful, wonderful book!"}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6483009-melanie", "userReview": "In FINDING PERFECT, twelve-year-old Molly is the kind of girl that I could be.

That there isn\u2019t always a \u201cright answer.\u201d That sometimes you\u2019ll work towards that ideal solution that fixes all the problems, while knowing that it doesn\u2019t really exist, and it\u2019s all just a matter of perspective. In Finding Perfect, 12-year old Molly Nathans might seem like she\u2019s perfect to her friends and classmates. She certainly strives for it in her grades, organization and appearance. But she\u2019s also struggling with other problems that are out of her control: the prospect of her best friend moving away, her parents\u2019 separation, her mother\u2019s new out-of-the-country job, and her own brain\u2019s increasingly frustrating tendencies that might be obsessive compulsive disorder.By linking that \u201cillusion of perfection\u201d theme with Molly\u2019s OCD, author Elly Swartz manages the brilliant feat of finding the universal in the specific. Readers who haven\u2019t experienced the feelings of uncertainty from separated or absent parents or the exhausting tension of daily life with OCD will certainly feel it here. From the very start, Molly is a vivid and incredibly relatable main character because we\u2019re eased into her head with logical thought patterns and we\u2019re shown the comfort that comes from planning, organization and stability. As we follow her journey and her problems grow, we feel every subtle change in her voice. The anxious places her mind goes during conversations with her friends. Her frequent tangents to wash her hands again and again. The impulse to count that slips into her thoughts (and narration), making us read faster with a rising panic in our gut as she tries to keep her problems a secret. Finding Perfect is both intense and intensely satisfying because of its authenticity. The details\u2013in everything from Molly\u2019s hyper-focused thoughts to her compelling relationships with her siblings, parents and friends\u2013will suck you in. And the refusal to trivialize or magically solve these issues will have you avidly reading to that touching and well-earned ending and keep you thinking about it long after."}, {"userName": "Nicole Otting", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5725499-nicole-otting", "userReview": "Elly Swartz has done a beautiful job with her debut novel.

Perfect grades, perfectly attired, top place in slam poetry competitions. And let's not forget her perfectly tidy room, with her glass animal figurine collection, each animal evenly spaced from the next. But beneath that perfect lies a secret: ever since Mom left (ostensibly for a job in Toronto, but it felt like leaving, period), Molly's been overcome by fear. She worries nonstop about terrible things happening to her little brother Ian. The only thing that helps is counting by fours and keeping everything in perfect order. But how long can she keep everything in perfect order, really?In this heartfelt debut novel, Swartz explores Molly's growing understanding of her own problems -- and the coping mechanism that doesn't keep them in line -- as all of it spins out of control. Molly isn't alone in any of this -- she's surrounded by well-intentioned friends and has a caring older sister -- but there's an isolation that comes from thinking you're crazy, one which Swartz deftly communicates. My heart broke for Molly, who tries so hard to be strong, but who cannot single-handedly solve this problem. OCD is a very misunderstood disorder, one that many refer to jokingly -- \"I'm a little OCD\", etc. -- in a way that minimizes its real harm, but one that thankfully can be treated.I loved getting to follow Molly's journey toward an understanding that \"perfect\" doesn't really exist; it's a myth. I think this story will speak to a lot of tween readers, especially in communities where this elusive \"perfect\" feels like the end goal."}, {"userName": "Mrs. Montjoy's Class", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56010531-mrs-montjoy-s-class", "userReview": "Finding Perfect catches the perfect moment at the perfect time and makes it so real to the readers.

Molly is also great at writing poetry, and participates in her school's poetry slam contest. Winning this contest is all part of her plan to bring her mother home who left for a job in Canada.

I've heard so many wonderful things about Finding Perfect that I was really excited to read it. I was drawn into the story almost immediately. The main character, Molly, is a girl that we've all known in our lives. She's the kind of girl who seems to have it all together: good grades, good friends, good looks. At first, the neatness and insistence on organization and cleanliness seem kind of quirky, but not beyond what you would expect. As the story develops, you see the situation slide from somewhat eccentric to troubling and unhealthy. The plot really pulls the reader into Molly's downward spiral so that one can begin to understand what an anxiety condition like OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder) feels like.I love that readers can learn so much from a book that is also very engaging and well written. You often hear people talk about OCD, and I had a vague notion about repetitive actions, like hand washing. But this book shows that this condition affects people from all walks of life and in all sorts of ways. I think it's great that this book is available to kids who might be experiencing some of the same worries as Molly, or know someone who does. And even if this condition hasn't affected you personally, this book will certainly help build empathy for people who need help. This is an awesome book, especially for kids in middle and high school."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22720974-dana", "userReview": "My book club (#bookquest) received an ARC from the author to share. From the second page of this story, I was hooked. Molly's mother leaves for a job in Toronto, promising to return in one year. As Molly's family copes with this change, Molly feels more and more responsible for her little brother's well-being. With the added stress and fear that Mom is not coming back, Molly's develops an increasing number of OCD tendencies.What I found most powerful about this story was the internal conflict Molly had. Her tendencies and her fears kept isolating her from the rest of the world, but she also felt that the \"old Molly\" was slipping away. The author crafted this feeling in such a realistic and heartbreaking way, it was easy to put myself in Molly's place. However, this story isn't only about Molly. Each character, friends and family, has a different way of coping with losses or struggles. It brings to light the different ways people react to adverse situations.As a third grade teacher, I feel like it may be difficult for some to understand, but it would certainly open the door to conversations about OCD, coping, and empathy. The teacher's guide has excellent suggestions and ideas for classroom discussions.

She's talented! Yet as we begin reading her story, there are a few hints that \"hidden\" Molly is not telling. She lines up a glass animal collection in her room with a ruler, ensures it \"feels\" right before she can leave. She almost purchases another animal, but realizes that would make 45 of them, a \"terrible\" odd number. She washes her hands four times and lines up her colored pencils per the Roy.G.Biv rainbow line-up. Her best friend Hannah and little brother Ian notice a few things, but Molly tries hard to keep all these needs to herself.  Molly's mother has recently left for a new job in Toronto, says it's only for a year. Things do not seem right, however, and Molly is certain if she manages to do the poetry slam perfectly, she can entice her mother back to the celebration banquet. Then all will be all right, really perfect. The progression of this illness through Molly's thoughts is shown to be frightening. To be perfect, certain criteria had to be met, then Molly could move on to the next task. But things, even best friends, get in the way, her mother doesn't always call, and her father is working hard to meet his own deadlines. I love that Elly Swartz showed how out of control OCD can become, and that there are professionals that help along with support groups for all ages. I also loved that it was shown that all the characters indeed were not perfect, had their own quirks, which made us readers sympathize. The challenges Molly had were that her illness worsened, and she was terrified that if she did not do some of the things, her little brother Ian would die of some illness.
