Lo and behold a week later it went onto the Kindle Daily Deal and I snatched it up. It\u2019s almost like Amazon knew (eyes dart back and forth quickly). I originally had this idea of the molasses/cornflake lava that they used in the old Godzilla movies\u2026 I had no thought of a tidal wave bearing down on people at speeds of 35 miles per hour.Ok. I have now stopped and started writing this review three times. I\u2019ll say this: reading about the Molasses Flood, the Cascade Avalanche, and the Hinckley Forest fires is really making me reconsider my stance on corporate freedoms vs. government regulation. In the end I don\u2019t trust anybody, I think we need business to watch government, we need the government to watch businesses, but MOST importantly we need an actively involved citizenry watching both of them. There, please keep trolling to a minimum. It\u2019s hard to read through history and not realize that man, really shitty people are often in charge of things, damn that Peter Principle and the Bottom Line. It\u2019s also great to read through history and realize how many notable and amazing people there are in each generation, that are just trudging ahead with life until extraordinary circumstances call on them to be more. There were three things about this book that really hurt its rating:  1)The captions on the photos (which were excellent finds) almost always gave away what was going to happen in the chapter. Now, I know its history, but this is the only book on this subject, it\u2019s relatively hard to find out information on it, so there is some amount of mystery as to who dies, how the court rules, etc. That mystery was destroyed by the fact that a chapter would start with a picture, and the caption always gave away the ending. No spoilers please, even in history books. 2)It was repetitive. I was really interested in all the stories about the Italian immigrants, but at several points the author restated the same statistic twice, or nearly the same paragraph as in a previous chapter, and it sort of felt cumbersome in the beginning. 3) The book didn\u2019t start with a clear thesis. I don\u2019t normally care if a history book starts with a clear thesis, sometimes I enjoy being taken along for the ride, but with the plentiful side stories about anarchists, WWI soldiers, etc., and thesis clearly tying these thigns all together in the beginning would have been beneficial. Yes, by the middle of the story it was entirely clear that the author was describing the Anarchist turmoil because they were blamed by USIA (eyeroll) for the bombing of the tank, BUT in the beginning, that could have been more clear and would\u2019ve made the initial chapters on the subject seem more coherent.Still I learned an extraordinary amount- the Anarchist reign of terror was something I\u2019m not very familiar with, nor was I familiar with the antipathy towards Italian immigrants (there are strong correlations here between Italians and the assimilation of our modern day immigrants), and really, outside of cooking I had no idea about the practical and industrial applications of molasses. For all its weaknesses, it\u2019s a very interesting book. The author\u2019s strength is in the retelling of the damages and the loss of the low-wage earners in the area. He can write very compellingly of their trials during and after the flood. You sure to learn an unexpected amount.'And finally I leave you with this.

He disregards direct pleas from people who work at the structure and feel that it is dangerous, insisting that he, the middle manager, knows better. However, the middle manager is sufficiently concerned to order the tower painted the color of molasses, so the extent of the leaking is not so obvious. When disaster inevitably strikes and innocent (also: poor, foreign, powerless) people are killed, the manager's organization goes into full spin-control mode, wrapping itself in the flag and blaming shadowy foreign terrorists. (Insert your own rueful comment about more recent world events here.) Meanwhile, the organization acquires the services of the best lawyers and experts that money can buy, just in case.Descriptions of this incident often contain the word \u201ccurious\u201d, because we're not used to thinking of molasses as being as dangerous as, say, water or fire. Water looks harmless in the glass, and fire seems fairly friendly at the end of a match, but we've all seen evidence of the power of these elements \u2013 if you're fortunate, only on You Tube or in the movies. The few souls who have witnessed a wall of molasses several stories tall devouring a whole neighborhood have passed away, so the rest of us are free today to envision molasses as a vaguely ridiculous gelatinous substance oozing harmlessly from a tiny jar. So cute! Not at all like a nightmare of brown sludge pounding down the city streets with the velocity of a speeding car, drowning people and pulverizing structures unfortunate enough to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. One of the unlikely heroes in this book turns out to be Hugh Ogden, the Boston judge for the subsequent court case against the owners of the tank. On first examination, he seems like the type who might be sympathetic to the foreign terrorist argument, meaning, he was a strict law-and-order patriot and veteran. Lawyers for the owners attempted to appeal to Ogden's presumed political bias. I speculate that Judge Ogden realized that getting at the truth of the case, even if it contradicted his political sympathies, was the best service he could do for his country. This he did, finding for the families of those killed and injured. I hope that his spirit continues to live on in judges today.Recommended in The Given Day by Dennis Lehane."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3229870-wanda", "userReview": "I liked, but not loved, this accessibly written book. I had no idea that there had been such an event, and the thought of it was pretty horrific. For all neo-cons, this is what happens when industry and corporations are left to regulate themselves. There is a reason for inspections and oversight of big business. To think of the corners that were cut in the name of saving money and profit at the expense of lives is completely deplorable. Also, the cost of the clean up must have been astronomical -- the corporation should have been charged for every penny!So, why did I give it 3 and not 5 stars. First, as a history this is really flawed. Puleo continually gets into the heads of the people who were involved in this tragedy and imagines their thoughts, feelings, and otherwise makes attributions that are just that -- imagined. That is not history; it is historical fiction. Second, as a historian, he should be a bit more of a fact checker. To cite one example, he talks about a victim whose hair turned white overnight as a result of the accident. Heeeellllooo. This is physiologically not possible. It is a myth. Hair is dead tissue, and while hair becomes white, what is already on your head does not. Third, he moralizes and inserts his opinion a bit too much for a historian in my opinion. He makes assertions regarding Italian Americans and their reluctance to organize, a stance that changes as a result of this tragedy. While this may have been a tipping point to community organization, the world does not work quite this simply, and he should really have provided a citation or two to support this contention.While this was somewhat melodramatic historical fiction, it was by no means a history in the true sense of the word. Read it for entertainment, but read with a big grain of salt."}, {"userName": "Newport Librarians", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2111755-newport-librarians", "userReview": "Did you ever hear of the \u201cgreat molasses flood\u201d in Boston? I grew up hearing about this event \u2013 probably because it took place in and around Boston\u2019s North End, and we had ties to and visited the North End frequently. But even I took the reality of this event with a grain of salt.But it actually happened. Around noon on January 15th, 1919, a fifty-foot-tall tank FILLED with over 2 million gallons of thick, black molasses collapsed \u2013 creating a massive tidal wave (fifteen feet high, some say) that traveled at a speed of over 35 miles per hour and transformed Boston\u2019s North End into a disaster area. Twenty one people were killed, many animals were destroyed, and the injury and destruction left in its wake were devastating.Dark Tide by Steven Puleo is a fascinating story \u2013 not only of the tragic flood, but of the social and cultural drama that led up to the tragedy \u2013 from the tank\u2019s construction (in 1915) all the way through the inevitable lawsuit that followed. Mr. Puleo is an award-winning newspaper reporter and his style is highly readable.

In 1919, on the eve of Prohibition, a storage silo in Boston's North End was being filled with molasses which was about to be shipped off to be turned into alcohol. In the cold of January the tank was half filled with nearly a million gallons of molasses. The tank had been leaking for years. Children from the neighborhood came daily with their buckets to collect the leaked molasses for their mothers to use in their cooking. The watchman had complained often about the leaking and the solution the tank owners came up with was to paint the silo brown so the leaks weren't as noticeable. On this particular morning a ship loaded with molasses had come up from Puerto Rico following the Gulf Stream and unloaded over a million gallons of warm molasses into the cold molasses. The rumbling and grumbling inside the tank began as the warm molasses caused a chemical reaction with the cold. The tank burst open flooding 2 million gallons of molasses through the Boston streets. It knocked out an elevated train, wiped out a firehouse, killed 21 people, many horses and injured many more.This story is so well told -- the lead up to the explosion, the catastrophe itself and the aftermath that it reads like novel.

It also made me wish I knew all history, every single interesting event that ever happened. So, in 1919, there was a gigantic molasses flood in Boston, which is interesting enough. Add in the political climate of the times, with anarchists in every doorway, a changing Federal climate, corporations more concerned with profit than safety, and a bunch of hard-working people doing their level best to keep their families afloat while the economy was in a slump... and it's a lot like today, only with horses and steam engines.

I had heard of the disaster (in which 21 people lost their lives, hundreds were injured and multiple structures destroyed). But, I had absolutely NO IDEA of the events tied in with the event...like Sacco & Vanzetti and the anarchist movement, World War I, the rum/slavery/molasses triangle trade. Having connections in the North End helped keep me interested during the descriptions of the legal ramifications in the mid-end of the book.  I found it particularly interesting when the book described how the Italians were discriminated against, yet they insisted on keeping to members of their own community, didn't try to become citizens or learn the language. This played a big part in the ability of the company to build the structure in the North End to begin with. Unlike the Irish, the residents took no part in the city government, etc. and thus were considered irrelevant. Somehow, similar themes continue in society today.

What struck me most was the fact that Stephen Puleo gave the molasses flood a number of human faces. The majority of the book is narrative by and about the people involved in the flood. The rest of the book is a chronicle of the time period. A huge part of this book is about showing the world of the mid 1910s and into the twenties, spanning the anarchist and labor movements, World War I, the rise of big business, and prohibition. Many of the quotes in Dark Tide resonate today on topics from white flight and xenophobia/racism to the growing divide between the haves and the have nots. I'd highly recommend this book to anyone who'd like to learn more about American history, uncommon disasters, corporate greed, Boston, or just an interesting read about human nature. I read this from cover to cover and would highly suggest the paperback. In it, the author shares a letter that a reader sent him from her step-father.

Puleo is a powerful historian, weaving together a wide context of political movements, changing views of big business, and military technologies into a hammock in which to rest this one event of 1919. He draws from contemporary newspaper accounts, personal correspondence, and thousands of pages of trial transcripts to present well-documented portraits of the major players, and while he makes a number of value judgments along the way about right and wrong, he backs up his opinions with clear facts and fair reasoning. Puleo's background as a journalist also contributes to the success of this work, as he shares slices of life (with details down to the smells and sounds) that bring his characters to life.The book follows a three-act structure. First, Puleo describes the events leading to the molasses flood, with a description of the importance of molasses to the development of the United States, a view of the daily lives of those who would most directly be victimized, and an exploration of the anarchist movement and xenophobia that bubbled like two million gallons of fermenting molasses in a tank. In the second act, Puleo goes step by step through the events of the tragedy, quoting eyewitnesses and compassionately recording the last moments of men, women, and children as they were crushed or drowned by the brown sludge. In the third act, Puleo delves deeply into the civil suit that resulted from this tragedy, using extensive quotes directly from the trial transcripts. The structure is completely effective and a perfect way to show readers the importance of what happened on one January day in 1919. The only real complaint I have with the book is likely the fault of the editors. This book has a fair number of photographs, from city scenes while the molasses tank was still standing, to shots of the destruction during the flood, to a portrait of the man hearing the civil suit. This last portrait, though, has a caption that I do not believe Puleo would have written, as it unnecessarily reveals the outcome of the case. Puleo's words carefully draw out the dramatic tension for dozens of pages, surely intending to keep the reader guessing as to which way the judgment will go, but because of this stupid caption at the beginning of the third act, Puleo's careful efforts are for naught. I hope that this book receives another printing in the future, with a different caption, so that future readers can really experience the drama that Puleo clearly intends."}, {"userName": "George", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1021218-george", "userReview": "INTERESTING, ENTERTAINING, INFORMATIVE.\u201cSo that this steel reservoir contained on the day of the accident a weight of molasses equal to 130 hundred-ton locomotive engines\u2026or thirteen thousand Ford automobiles.\u201dHistory, mystery, and courtroom drama, with the singularly bizarre circumstance of, as my goodreads.com friend, Newengland so well phrased it, \"death by molasses.\u201d Oh yeah, and along with a major disaster, there's a World War, the Great Influenza Pandemic, the onset of prohibition, and bunches bomb throwing anarchists all rolled into the mix.

However this was not fiction, this really happened in January of 1919 and the gush of molasses caused tremendous damage to homes and businesses, as well as the lives of about twenty people. This is an excellent work of well researched nonfiction that chronicles the establishment of the tank that functioned to hold the molasses until it could be processed nearby into alcohol for munition purposes and the WW1 effort. The surrounded counter-culture of anarchists was also explored for this ended up being the argument for the defense as to the cause of the tank's collapse, that an unnamed anarchist bombed the tank, instead of the more likely scenario of the tank's shoddy construction.

You can write a book about a local historical event, and miss the bigger picture; or you can write a historical book that is almost all historical context but which ends up with no meat on the actual bone (I'm thinking of the recent Henry Hudson book, Fatal Journey); and too often the history bookshelves are choked with one or the other. But it's always a joy to find a book that tells a specific story, but ties it to the bigger world stage, in an interesting way.This is one of those. It tells a local Boston story: of a huge tank built in 1915 to hold molasses fresh from arriving ships, for later shipment to an industrial alcohol distillery; and of the collapse of this tank in 1919, killing 21 people and injuring 150, and destroying many buildings. It tells a bigger story: America's complex relationship with World War I, with anarchism and a wave of terror far more extensive in the US than we see today, with Italian immigration and their resistance to citizenship, with Big Business, with our legal expectations regarding corporate liability, and more. It is both well researched, and personal. This is the kind of history that tells about events that your grandparents were in, and then didn't talk much about; and it's often the task of historians to bring these stories back to the surface so that families can know them. (There's a touching extra afterword in my edition that shares some of these family encounters, including an eyewitness account in a family letter.)I'd heard about this event, which is almost a history trivia item, but had not realized the scale of the thing. When I saw the book, in a recent trip to Boston, I decided to get it, and then learned it's the ONLY book on the subject.My one quibble is that the book elects to employ one of the techniques of Creative Non-Fiction: the fictionalization of internal thoughts and feelings that are not testified to by history. When I'm told what a character is thinking and seeing and smelling at a particular moment on a particular day, I feel that I'm being lied to, and it throws me out. It's so easy to suggest the same thing, rather than to state it outright, but Puleo is clear in the back of the book that he used this method (and gives an example), so it's one of those choices. I don't like it, but he keeps it mostly under control.I'll end with thanks, because I know several historians and writers and librarians and researchers who plow similar fields of study, and tend the same vines. It takes an enormous amount of work and study and care and attention to tell a story like this. It was worth telling, and I'm glad somebody (supported by a host of others) took up the challenge and carried it, so successfully, to the end."}, {"userName": "Robert Beveridge", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/766524-robert-beveridge", "userReview": "Stephen Puleo, Dark Tide: The Great Boston Molasses Flood of 1919 (Beacon Press, 2003)When I finished reading this book, there was still snow on the ground. Here we are enjoying a string of ninety-plus days that has stretched on seemingly endlessly. It's been four months and a few days, to be more precise. I've been mulling over what to say about Dark Tide ever since. I don't know why I haven't come up with anything; I enjoyed it quite a bit, and if it's not still as fresh in my memory as it was the day I finished, I still remember a good deal of it, more than usual when it comes to straight history books. And yet I still can't find all that much to say about it. But if I just say \u201chey, you need to read this\u201d, that's really not much of a recommendation, is it? Certainly not as much as this book deserves.The Great Molasses Flood of 1919, when it is remembered at all, is usually a halfhearted punchline more than it is a remembered event. How could a flood of molasses have been an event? But remember, this is Boston, where a few boxes of tea started a war. Think about the idea of two point three million gallons of molasses. (You know those one-gallon containers of milk at the supermarket? Imagine if they were the supermarket. Not only all the stock, but the bricks, the shelving, everything. Now imagine two or three of those.) Now imagine two point three million gallons of molasses packed into a steel tank fifty feet high and ninety feet in diameter. Imagine if that tank was shoddily built, with every possible corner cut, so that the tank constantly leaked molasses when even a third full. Now imagine what would happen if all that molasses fermented... if the picture in your mind involved a fifteen-foot-high wall of molasses capable of derailing an elevated train, leveling local tenements, and killing twenty-one people, then you're dead on. Puleo takes the docudrama approach to part of this story in order to build tension, but we won't count that against him; this is a tale of corporate corruption, quotidian heroism, and delicious all-natural sweeteners par excellence. Meticulous research combines with a raconteur's flair to make this a solid, and solidly-grounded, read. ****"}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16122955-chris", "userReview": "Dark Tide is a well-written history of the collapse of a 2.3 million gallon molasses tank that occurred in Boston in 1919. The book encompasses the events from the inception of the molasses storage tank (Part I), through the tank\u2019s collapse (Part II), to the ensuing litigation (Part III). The book is well-researched and well-written. Puleo clearly knows the subject matter. Aided by, among other thing, thousands of pages of court transcripts, he is able to effectively bring the people connected to the disaster to life.The book does have flaws. In Part I, and to a lesser extent in the beginning of Part III, Puleo introduces subject matter with seemingly no connection to the book\u2019s topic. In particular, Puleo discusses the activities of anarchists operating in the region at the time, yet he offers no insight into the reason for this subplot. Not until the start of the litigation in Part III does it become clear these activities are central to the defense\u2019s claim that anarchists caused the disaster by means of an explosive device. By leaving readers in the dark about this for two-thirds of the book, Puleo treats the story as a mystery or historical thriller instead of the straight-up history it should be. Most of the readership is unlikely to be aware ahead of reading the story that the tank owners claimed that explosives were the cause of the disaster. Furthermore, the Prologue and the tone of Part I clearly lead the reader to believe, correctly, that this was a simple structural failure. Puleo would have done well to include an introduction that explained the breadth of the topic. In a brief Author\u2019s Note in the front, he does allude to wanting to put the story in the context of world events, but his allusion is too subtle, and does not account for how these events relate to the disaster. The seemingly random insertions of anarchist activity are brief, though, and ultimately only slightly detract from this very good book."}, {"userName": "John-Paul", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37315324-john-paul", "userReview": "Like the vast majority of the American public, I had only heard faint reports of this event in the early 20th Century, and most of the time what it sounded like was some kind of urban legend. Did it even happen at all or is it just a clever story to tell the Boston tourists? Well, after reading this excellently researched work by Stephen Puleo, I can say that it did indeed happen and it was most certainly a tragedy, not the least because it didn't have to happen at all. Just as in another of his books (The Caning) Puleo does a masterful job personalizing the story and making the characters almost jump right off the page. Rich or poor, immigrant or not, all the stories and memories of this disaster are given equal footing for the reader to make their determination (though I would be hard pressed to find another reason for the tragedy than that of gross negligence).Puleo weaves his story slowly, showing first the conditions around which the molasses tank was built, its brief history and finally, its tragic failure. He shows with sensitivity how many people's lives were forever changed (and in the case of several, ended) by carelessness and deceit. He also indicated the climate in America at this time with regard to our emerging international presence as well as the rise of anarchist activity. Far from being a freak accident that is relegated to the dustbin of history, this tragedy should be seen as a clear product of its time and the beginning of the concept of corporate social responsibility...something that could probably still be worked on today!"}, {"userName": "Carter West", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8605557-carter-west", "userReview": "Boston's Great Molasses Flood of January 15, 1919 sticks [sic] in popular consciousness mostly as a risible curiosity, a freakish event best relegated to one of American history's sideshows. Stephen Puleo has rescued it from that sorry fate, lifted it up for study, and transformed it into a mirror of early 20th century American society. High-handed and shady dealings of industry; fervid dreams of anarchists; divisions of class and ethnicity; gaps in governmental regulation -- all these factors and more played a part in unleashing the brown viscous wave that tore up Commercial Street in Boston's North End that warm winter day. Puleo does an admirable job of balancing these forces along the beam of his narrative. Nor does he stint rhetorical force in describing the horrors of the flood itself: the buckled elevated track, the houses turned to kindling, the agony of death by asphyxiation. True, he allows himself too many redundancies, paragraph by paragraph: the book could be 20 to 25 pages shorter. But that frustration is a small price to pay for the opportunity to color in your mental map of Boston -- and American -- history with a picture so surprisingly helpful in illustrating our society's panorama. Well recommended."}, {"userName": "Blakely", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2056623-blakely", "userReview": "This is an entertaining and immensely readible book. Puleo does a great job in making the events and people involved in the 1919 Boston Molasses Flood come to life. He follows the construction of the molasses tank in 1915 through the end of the court case in 1925. The key point in the story is (obviously) the day the molasses tank broke, spilling 2.3 million gallons of molasses in one of Boston's busiest neighborhood killing 20 and injuring hundreds. Puleo also tries to put the molasses tank in historical context, highlighting many of the problems of the early 20th century in the book so not only did I learn a lot about the Molasses flood, I also learned a lot about the place of molasses in history and the political and economic strife taking place from 1915-1925.The one weakness of this book is that Puleo spends a bit too much time on the troubles of the era prior to the tank collapsing. The first third of the book is much less interesting than the last two thirds and - while I wouldn't recommend this - could be skipped entirely. The first third of the book does put a lot of the events of the last two thirds of the book in context and is worth reading, it just drags on a bit too much.I highly recommend this!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/140130-rebecca", "userReview": "If you aren't aware of the Molasses Flood of 1919, you are likely, as I was, to chuckle just thinking about the Boston waterfront coated in the sticky stuff. But Stephen Puleo's narrative of this event is terrifying, heartbreaking, dramatic, yet never seems sensationalist. He opens the door to reveal a history not just of an isolated terrible tragedy, but the ongoing struggle between corporate power, politics, and ethnic/class stratification. This book isn't just about the fifteen foot high wave that killed over 20 people (according the legal ruling) and injured multitudes of others, but is about what justice really means when an unexpected tragedy takes center stage against the backdrop of society's everyday tragedies. Beautifully written and extensively researched, this is one of the most riveting historical accounts I've ever read."}, {"userName": "Eva Nickelson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2502971-eva-nickelson", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book, even with its dark subject matter. Cut into three parts (construction, flood and aftermath, civil court case), the book truly tries to relate everything that was happening in that time surrounding the flood. While it can be repetitive at times, it recounts the history as stories and fragments taken from primary sources. It doesn't try to hoist emotions on the key characters, instead Puelo invokes what the reader would feel if placed in a certain situation.I spent a good portion of this book thinking about how this would be handled today and what kind of answers a full simulation could provide. It is a very intriguing book, and it brought the North End in the early twentieth century alive."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8082262-diane", "userReview": "This book was an eye-opening look at an event which profoundly changed America, that hardly anyone knows about. An above ground storage tank of molasses collapsed and killed people. Molasses was used to create munitions during the first world war, as well as rum. So huge quantities of it were necessary. There were simply no regulations on storage tanks, where they could be located, or how they needed to be built. This book creates Boston in the early decades of the twentieth century and tells about the business climate of the time. Even though regulations were beginning to be standard, as muckraking journalists and progressive politicians worked together, this story helps us remember why regulations are a good idea. On a personal note, this is the first ebook I bought."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1241721-lisa", "userReview": "This book was so interesting, I found myself doing research on some of the historical details referenced (League of Nations, Sacco and Venzetti, prohibition). Puleo uses the story of Boston's molasass flood to paint a picture of life in Boston (and America) from WWI to prohibition. It was a formative time in this country's history, for industry, politics, morals, industries' relationship to their labor force and citizens' relationship to their government. Puleo touches on all of this in his telling the story of the flood. A quick read that is chock full of fun facts - I recommend it to anyone who is interested even just a little bit in American history."}], "description": "Around noon on January 15, 1919, a group of firefighters was playing cards in Boston's North End when they heard a tremendous crash.

A third firefighter jumped up from his chair to look out a window-\"Oh my God!\" he shouted to the other men, \"Run!\"A 50-foot-tall steel tank filled with 2.3 million gallons of molasses had just collapsed on Boston's waterfront, disgorging its contents as a 15-foot-high wave of molasses that at its outset traveled at 35 miles an hour.
