Unfortunately this wasn\u2019t really it. It is a novella, almost a short story and easily readable in one sitting. It revolves around four medical students who share digs. The story is written my one of them and is found by his family after he dies many years later. Two of the group are interested in experimentation with the end of life and bringing back the dead. They have the truly daft idea of capturing the last breath, which they think has potency, and using it to bring someone else back to life. It takes a while to get going, isn\u2019t really scary as a good story in this genre should be and the ending is truly silly. Not up to Hill\u2019s usual standard. Back to M R James I suppose. There were also a couple of silly typos."}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "In 1983, Susan Hill wrote a decent ghost story called The Woman in Black that was turned into a brilliant West End production. Since then she\u2019s been coasting on her reputation as a horror writer, churning out extremely dull ghost novellas every now and then that nonetheless sell quite well due to the Woman in Black\u2019s success. So it goes with Printer\u2019s Devil Court, which is the worst thing by Hill that I\u2019ve read to date.Set in some time that could be the Victorian or Edwardian era, Hugh Meredith is a med student living in crappy digs in Printer\u2019s Devil Court with a couple others. His flatmates are a bit mad and, after talking about Lazarus one night after dinner, they reveal to Meredith that they can bring the dead back to life \u2013 sort of. That sounds like a passably interesting plot, no? Susan Hill doing the Frankenstein thing? So why is it subtitled \u201cA Ghost Story\u201d? Because Susan Hill is best known for ghost stories, which sell. The reveal of the supernatural thing in this story is total garbage. Is it a ghost? Is it some kind of resurrected body/semi-conscious zombie? What was the point of resurrecting the dead again? Horror doesn\u2019t work if you don\u2019t know basic things about what we\u2019re supposed to be scared about and why. Instead of working on the feeble \u201cstory\u201d, Hill instead does her usual trick of writing extensively about the atmosphere. If there\u2019s one thing I hate reading, it\u2019s descriptions of weather and the background, but Hill positively revels in this kind of extraneous crud so the pages are padded out with images of dark, foggy London, fireside chats, and oh god I\u2019m falling asleep just recounting it. Hill doesn\u2019t have a clue when it comes to originality. She adopts the clich\u00e9d \u201cstory within a story\u201d approach that the Victorians favoured: a framing device of the \u201cpresent day\u201d, with the main story taking place years in the past, usually via a just-discovered manuscript. The drawings included here are unremarkable and add nothing to the story, clearly serving to add to the page count only. The whole thing looks like a weak facsimile of a bad Victorian ghost story. It\u2019s not much of a book anyway \u2013 it\u2019s essentially a short story that\u2019s been stretched out to 100 pages long through large font size, corny pencil drawings, lots of blank space between chapter endings and blank dividing pages. Shockingly, there are a ton of typos in this short story (\u201cPrinter\u2019s Devil\u2019s Court\u201d) which makes it clear this was rushed out to make the publishers a quick buck. Was there even an editor on this thing, either to pick up obvious typos or perhaps focus the story? Doesn\u2019t look like it. Printer\u2019s Devil Court is a piss-awful \u201chorror\u201d story that doesn\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a ghost story or a weird Frankenstein/zombie thing, and it has the least satisfying ending ever. Susan Hill is a vastly overrated horror writer \u2013 she\u2019s in fact an utterly appalling one. Put simply this book is 95% nothing, 5% might-as-well-be nothing. It\u2019s certainly not scary and might be the most pathetic excuse for a ghost story I\u2019ve ever read. For great horror short stories, I highly recommend reading Shirley Jackson instead."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "Part of the Kindle Single series, Printer's Devil Court is a brand new short story from Susan Hill. In the tradition of her well-known historical ghost stories, the most famous of which is The Woman in Black, it's a spooky, atmospheric tale set predominantly in early-twentieth-century London. Against a backdrop of impenetrable fogs and bleak winter storms, a young trainee doctor becomes unwittingly involved in a devilish scheme devised by two of his acquaintances, which will come to haunt him for many years afterwards. Despite its extreme brevity, I found this tale more fully realised and satisfying than Hill's two most recent longer-length ghost stories.

I found that I didn\u2019t really care about any of them, even Meredith. Their experiments are suitably horrific enough, but if I want horrific experiments, I know I\u2019ll stick to Shelley in the future. Frankenstein portrayed the horror of morality in science far better than Printer\u2019s Devil Court has. I know Susan Hill is supposed to be masterful at ghost stories, but truly? I\u2019m not seeing it here. All I see is a jumbled mess of characters and half-baked ideas. If only Hill could have properly meshed them together. Perhaps then it would have been suitably gripping."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17629329-leah", "userReview": "A young medical student has taken rooms in Printer's Devil Court in London, sharing them with three other medical men. One evening, the four men have a discussion as to whether the story of Lazarus could possibly have been true \u2013 is it scientifically possible to bring someone back from the dead? Two of the men hint that they have been carrying out experiments on the subject and ask Meredith and the fourth man if they would like to join in. The fourth man considers the whole idea to be blasphemous and refuses, but Meredith's curiosity wins out, and he agrees to be a witness to the experiments \u2013 a decision he will regret for the rest of his life.Susan Hill has written this very much in the style of a Victorian ghost story although it's set in the 20th century. It feels very much like working to a recipe...1 notebook revealing a terrible secret1 creepy street name4 medical students2 or 3 graveyards to taste2 corpses1 late night adventure in a mortuary1 man racked by conscience and haunted for the rest of his lifeMix all together with a wooden spoon until smooth, and bake for 1 hour and 40 minutes.Unfortunately, the resulting cake is somewhat bland \u2013 a Victoria sponge without the jam perhaps. One feels that a vital ingredient has been forgotten...1 generous splash of essence of horrorThe quality of the writing and storytelling is quite high \u2013 it's just that it's a story we've all heard so often in various forms and Hill brings nothing new to the recipe. I felt she was so busily ensuring that she got it to sound authentically Victorian, which she succeeds in doing very well, that she lost sight somewhat of the fact that a ghost story ought to be scary, and in order to be scary it must have some element of unpredictability. I kept hoping there was going to be a twist that would turn expectations on their head, but I'm afraid it ran along too smoothly from beginning to end without deviating from the obvious route. And there's no added ingredient to make up for the lack of the scare factor \u2013 no great moral questions are raised, there's no element of humour. The most effective bits are the mortuary scene and the first graveyard scene, in both of which the quality of the writing does manage to create a chilling atmosphere, but from there on the story meanders on, not really going anywhere at all, until it reaches a completely anticlimactic end. I listened to the audiobook version which has a running time of 1 hour and 40 minutes. The narrator Stephen Pacey does a good job with the material available, but I'm afraid that my spine remained untingled and my hair unraised.NB This book was provided for review by Audible UK via Midas PR.www.fictionfanblog.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew", "userReview": "So here we are with the last (that I am aware of) of Susan Hills \"ghosts stories\" and I must admit this one though no great shocker did catch me out hence the high review.So another short ghost story in the classic - British fireside story - if it was in another season I would almost be tempted to call it a Christmas Ghost story. This one is typically atmospheric and perfectly illustrated, instilling a perfect sense of time and place. The story - and here it gets tricky without giving away spoilers - at first feels predictable, the characters, the location and even the subject matter. This is sense of familiarity is not dispelled as you carry on reading. For me it was more a case of enjoying the scene, as if I was watching a play unfold before me. However the final reveal, the conclusion to the story really caught me out and although neither shocking or disturbing was a creative twist I didn't see coming which I will admit on some stories is far from the case. Now I am sure many can provide titles of stories which have a similar twist but for me this is the first and for that it will stay with me (reading many Stephen King short stories have a similar place in my memories).So I have said it once and I am sure I will say it again - Susan Hill has a deft skill at weaving familiar and yet disturbing stories which defy the normal and as such will long remain in my mind, something I am and keep being impressed over."}, {"userName": "Cathleen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1297014-cathleen", "userReview": "I was looking for something spooky, atmospheric, and ghostly for Halloween reading.

The tale starts of well with Victorian doctors conducting experiments in the hope of successfully resurrecting a cadaver. The premise, although not original, promises a gripping ghost story in the Victorian Gothic tradition. Unfortunately, it doesn't deliver on that promise. Any ghost story worth penning needs a chilling twist, the kind that raises the hairs on the back of your neck, but the climax to this story is disappointing. I have been led to believe that Susan Hill deserves the hype surrounding her fiction, so I'm willing to give her another chance. Please tell me which of her ghost stories I should read.

He is drawn into a mysterious enterprise set up by fellow students Walter Powell and Rafe McAllister, namely bringing a dead person back to life. The results of witnessing the experiment come literally to haunt him in this novella by Susan Hill. The question I asked myself is, does this short story (a little over 100 pages) live up to the reputation that the author\u2019s ghost tales have established for her?The answer, surprisingly and disappointingly, is no. This is a rather humdrum fiction, devoid of suspense or horror and confusingly told. The frame is the re-appearance of a notebook bound expertly by Dr Meredith but of \u201cno commercial value\u201d, returned by a bookseller to the beneficiaries of the late medic. This tells his stepson what had he had refused to believe from previous telling, but still finds incredible. Frankly, the process by which the life essence of a just-expired destitute is transferred to another just about-to-expire destitute is unconvincingly envisaged, and the physical complications arising from donating and receiving bodies being of different genders is clumsy and illogical. The descriptions of subsequent hauntings in St Luke\u2019s churchyard and later in the West Country lack any power to chill, unfortunately.Matters are further confused by the inclusion of several Victorian engravings which give the impression of a 19th-century setting when the text soon makes it clear that time period of the tale is the 20th, with the Blitz occurring sometime between Meredith\u2019s training and his retirement from general practice. Perhaps the illustrations suggested a possible narrative which the author later transferred to a modern timeframe.Originally published in 2013 by the author\u2019s own company Long Barn Books in a Kindle Edition, this hardback edition by Profile Books a year later is bedevilled by printing errors in the first few pages, presumably transferred wholesale from the first edition. When Walter Powell becomes Walter Power, \u201cits\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s\u201d are confused and quotation marks are omitted I wondered if these were deliberate nods to the name of the London court where some of the action (such as it is) takes place \u2014 a printer\u2019s devil of course being an apprentice in a printing workshop \u2014 should one innocently assume the phrase refers to misprints and spelling mistakes that might inadvertently slip through the editing process. Luckily the rate of error swiftly decreases and the devil in the detail is largely absent thereafter.The hospital and churchyard which feature in the novel are entirely fictional, but Hill seems to have amalgamated several London institutions to create Printer\u2019s Devil Court and its environs. Fleet Street of course is still synonymous with newspaper publishing, though the huge printing presses have long since gone. St Luke-by-the-Gate and its nearby hospital for paupers might well be based on the real-life St Luke\u2019s Hospital for Lunatics, founded in 1751 and then rebuilt north of the City of London. The site was sold during the First World War to the Bank of England, becoming St Luke\u2019s Printing Works and producing banknotes for several decades. Thus printing, church and hospital may have coalesced to form the miasmic background of Hill\u2019s ghost story.http://wp.me/s2oNj1-court"}, {"userName": "K.B.

I\u2019m a pretty slow reader but I read this in a couple of hours. Printer\u2019s Devil Court is home to four medical students. One night when they are gathered around the fire talking the conversation takes a sinister turn. The narrator, Hugh, soon finds himself being drawn into some dark goings on in dark corners of basements and disused mortuaries.There are obvious overtones of Mary Shelly\u2019s Frankenstein in this book and it reminded me slightly of the 1970\u2019s film \u2018The Asphyx\u2019 The book is also illustrated, which does give the feel of a Victorian/Edwardian book. Currently it\u2019s only available in hardback or Kindle versions. I have the Kindle version but the book cover looks very nice and it probably looks beautiful as a hardback; but for a book with such iffy reviews I couldn\u2019t justify the rather unappealing \u00a37.49 price tag, essentially just for a pretty cover. I enjoy Susan Hill\u2019s writing style; she has a knack for descriptive language which really helps you settle into the mood and atmosphere of a story. Where this story fell down for me was in the same place that \u2018The Mist in the Mirror\u2019 did, the end.I have been accused of being ambiguous in the endings of some of my own ghost stories; but ghost stories are supposed to be ambiguous. It isn\u2019t necessary for us to understand the mechanics of how someone returned from the dead or how exactly they got their revenge in a locked room unseen by the reader, off screen as it were. However, there is a crucial, and perhaps subtle, difference between an ambiguous ending that leaves scope for the reader\u2019s imagination and a frustratingly open and unnecessary ending.I can see that Hill is most likely trying to maintain the tradition of the twist ending. But if there is a twist ending in all of your books, surely the element of surprise is lost? Now, instead of catching you by surprise you\u2019re reading the book waiting for the twist. I wouldn\u2019t object to this if the twist was satisfying, but I didn\u2019t feel as though it was in this case. It read as though she reached the end of the book and realised she was a few hundred words short so tagged on a completely random scene that wasn\u2019t well enough explained to allow you to speculate over it properly. Other people may find that the explanation was obvious, but to me, although I have a couple of vague ideas what she might have been trying to suggest, I didn\u2019t really feel I had enough information to go on.That\u2019s what felt wrong in this book. It did a great job of creating the right atmosphere but it was light on plot details. I felt this especially when one character, who presumably is only there at all as a counterpoint to the other in the early pages, was written out with no further mention, presumably because he had fulfilled his purpose. Then there were moments when the narrator kept asking what two other characters were doing when they had just told him what they intended to do; It occasionally made it feel a little contrived in places. All in all not a bad book, some good classic gothic themes and imaginative take on the ghostly aspect of the story; but I personally would have enjoyed it more if it had ended before the epilogue, which didn\u2019t really work for me. Either that or had a more substantial epilogue."}, {"userName": "G.R.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1515960-g-r", "userReview": "Susan Hill's latest spooky offering, Printer's Devil Court, was published by Profile Books in 2014. At a little over a hundred pages long, I shot through it in no time, and I enjoyed it a great deal. It's perfect reading material for these cold, wet, gloomy winter evenings.Following the death of Dr Hugh Meredith, a hand-sewn manuscript is sent to his stepson by the London solicitors dealing with his estate. The small book, entitled 'The Wrong Life', contains the late doctor's account of certain experiments which took place during the early days of his medical career, the effects of which haunted him for the remainder of his life...In his first year as a junior doctor, Meredith takes lodgings in a house in Printer's Devil Court, which is also occupied by three other doctors: Walter Powell, James Kent and Rafe McAllister. One foggy November evening, the four doctors have eaten dinner together and are enjoying a glass of Port before an open fire when the discussion turns to the subject of raising the dead. Walter and Rafe, after swearing Meredith to secrecy, explain that they have been conducting secret experiments and need a helping hand to continue. Out of curiosity, Meredith goes along with his two housemates, but suspects that the whole thing is just a jape. Suffering from bronchitis, Meredith is sent away to his family home in Norfolk to recuperate over Christmas and thinks little more of the doings of Walter and Rafe, until he receives a telegram: 'Enterprise critical stage. Urgent you return and witness'. The effects of what he does witness, in a little used room in the basement of the London hospital where he works, haunt him for the rest of his life.The story is well-paced and very enjoyable and, as always, Hill's descriptions of the narrator's environment are excellently atmospheric. While reading this story, I was reminded of Daphne du Maurier's 'The Breakthrough', which also deals with the idea that it is possible to trap a person's life spark at the moment of death; though, in du Maurier's case it was with a computer and for a different purpose."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13802541-jess", "userReview": "I like Susan Hill. I first came across The Woman in Black when I was about 15 and it scared the life out of me. When it comes to the traditional ghost story, Hill is up there with the best. Sadly, this story really disappointed me.I hadn't realised Hill had released a new ghost story until I stumbled across it in my local library, and as Halloween is approaching I figured now would be the best time to borrow it. I'm a big fan of Gothic Literature that deals with themes such as re-animation and medical advancement gone wrong, like Mary Shelley's Frankenstein and Robert Louis Stevenson's The Body Snatcher, so I was excited to read Printer's Devil Court and be thoroughly creeped out.Sadly, it just didn't work for me. I didn't find the story spooky in the slightest, though there were some parts that made me a little sad. For the most part I was just bored. It isn't a long story at all, and yet it took me two days to get through it because I didn't feel like I had to know what was going to happen next. In fact if it were any longer I probably would have given up because I found the narrator so dull - he could have been any narrator from any story and I wouldn't have noticed the difference - and there was also the unfortunate inclusion of the \"beautiful dead woman\", which is a trope I am so tired of seeing in stories. Especially stories with male protagonists. It's creepy, and frankly if I saw someone dead or almost dead my first thought wouldn't be to mention that they're hella cute.On top of that the edition I read had quite a few mistakes and typing errors throughout that just threw me off. I don't expect to find so many mistakes in so little a book, especially not when it's been published. That's more the editor's fault than anyone else's and I know it doesn't really affect the story in any way, but I found it distracting.Sadly, it just wasn't for me but I'll still read more Hill in future."}, {"userName": "Dave Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48420769-dave-taylor", "userReview": "Having previously read and reviewed Dolly and been a little unimpressed by it, I decided to give Printer's Devil Court a go. Mainly because I don't like to give up on a writer without comparing their other works, but especially not one with such an extensive back catalogue as Susan Hill. I'm glad I tried this book, like Dolly (and most of Susan Hill's novels) it is classed as a 'chiller' but, much like Dolly, I found that it wasn't really scary it just had more suspense to hold my attention.Without giving anything away this relatively short novel is about mans never ceasing quest to subvert the laws of nature, with a slight nod toward Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly's 'Victor Frankenstein'. With both these books (and hopefully her style doesn't change much), the author writes in what could be said to be a style reminiscent and evocative of Edgar Allen Poe, H.P. Lovecraft, Bram Stoker and/or Mary Wollstonecraft Shelly. More recent writers with this sort of Victorian sparseness to their work, in my opinion were: Roald Dahl (in his Tales of the Unexpected) and, to a certain extent Ernest Hemingway. They used descriptive language without added embellishment. All these writers had the same thing in common, they managed to write in such a way that you feel that you are there, living the scenes yourself.Susan Hill has this ability in spades."}, {"userName": "Holly", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4717304-holly", "userReview": "I really love Susan Hill's writing. This is the fourth work I've read by her, and I'm excited to read more.Printer's Devil Court is a Victorian ghost story in the vein of M.R. James or Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu and the plot is reminiscent of Frankenstein. The story's overall tone is very Victorian, so if you have a problem with slow, old-fashioned pacing and style, you may not want to pick this one up (I can see that many other Goodreads reviewers weren't fans!) Printer's Devil Court is not as good as The Woman in Black, but it's comparable to Dolly or similar Hill stories (though I have to say that I preferred Dolly). If you're only used to modern horror stories, you may not like this one! If I had half stars, I'd probably give this a 3 1/2 out of 5."}, {"userName": "Charlotte", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4732637-charlotte", "userReview": "I was very impressed by this short story. Hill's prose is completely evocative of Victorian London, and the characterization is superb given that there is very little room for description in so few pages. The story is told via a book written by a doctor entitled 'The Wrong Life' that has fallen into the hands of his stepson. It tells of the doctor and his peers that all lodged in the same house. Two of his housemates began engaging in some strange research and the protagonist was witness to a very disturbing and eerie experiment. Over the years he tried to forget about what happened, and moved to the country to start a family and work as a rural doctor. However, one day he returned to the hospital at which the experiment occurred and that night he is confronted with a horrifying vision in a church graveyard which causes him to question everything. A really spooky read with a great sense of atmosphere, it would be perfect for a stormy winters night."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8624680-paul", "userReview": "I enjoyed this. A quaint little ghost story that was quite Dickensian in its telling.It was a neat little read, easy on my repairing brain, and I suppose in terms of length it must fall into the novella/novelette range. Susan Hill left a lot up to the reader's imagination in her telling, and this is most refreshing.As a ghost story it was cute. Lots of questions and no real answers (which I like) as it keeps you thinking after you've finished. If you're looking for a book that's not taxing but is equally quite interesting then give it a go. If I could, I'd give it 3.5 stars.I think you'll enjoy it as a bitesize read."}, {"userName": "Damaskcat", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6945307-damaskcat", "userReview": "Dr Hugh Meredith \u2013 country doctor in the West Country \u2013 leaves his step-son a manuscript which reveals some very shady goings on from when he was doing his medical training.

In the cellar of their narrow lodgings in Printer's Devil Court and a little used mortuary in a subterranean annex of the hospital, they have begun to interfere with death itself, in shadowy experiments beyond the realms of medical ethics. They call on Hugh to witness an event both extraordinary and terrifying. Years later, Hugh has occasion to return to his student digs and the familiar surroundings resurrect peculiar and unpleasant memories of these unnatural events, the true horror of which only slowly becomes apparent.", "title": "Printer's Devil Court", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23348593-printer-s-devil-court", "average": 3.22, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1431488234l/23348593.jpg", "reviews": 215, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/18874.Susan_Hill", "name": "Susan Hill"}], "type": ["Horror", "Fiction", "Horror", "Gothic", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23348593-printer-s-devil-court", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22601736-printer-s-devil-court", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18684588-printer-s-devil-court", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23357518-printer-s-devil-court", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30180719-printer-s-devil-court", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30354378-printer-s-devil-court", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37034.The_Woman_in_Black", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37040.The_Various_Haunts_of_Men", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37036.The_Pure_in_Heart", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8675320-the-small-hand", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7505921-the-shadows-in-the-street"]}
