I have to say I really enjoyed it much more than the Twilight series. I have seen a lot of people complain about how slow the beginning was, but I didn\u2019t really notice. It sucked me in pretty quickly. It was very clearly a Stephenie Meyer book, though, which did lead to certain amounts of anger and eyes rolling nearly out of my head.---My biggest complaint with Stephenie Meyer is her romantic plots. I feel like I\u2019ve accidentally picked up a Harlequin romance. It is super cheesy and super melodramatic. It makes my brain hurt. Here\u2019s an example: \u201cI stared into Jared\u2019s eyes, and the strangest thing happened. All the melting, melding, welding that I had just been through was shoved aside, into the smallest part of my body, the little corner that I took up physically. The rest of me yearned toward Jared with the same desperate, half-crazed hunger I\u2019d felt since the first time I\u2019d seen him here. This body barely belonged to me or to Mel\u2014it belonged to him\u201d (595, ARC). WHAT! First, horribly cheesy. Second, nobody but you owns your body, and if you find it romantic to think otherwise, that is unhealthy. Let\u2019s learn some emotional and physical independence!What the hell is up with underage characters and older men?! Why could the females not be slightly older? This is supposedly being marketed as an adult book, so maybe it\u2019s a bit alienating to make your main character(s) 16 when she first meets Jared who was 26, then 17 when she was starting in a new body (which they thought was younger!) when Ian is in his mid-20\u2019s (I am guessing).I\u2019m just glad the romantic interests were not supposed to be seen as perfect. They had similar flaws as Edward & Jacob, but we were not reminded every 20 seconds how easily they dazzled everyone. Jared can barely stand Wanderer for most of the book. He would kill her easily if it weren\u2019t Mel\u2019s body. He is cruel and violent towards her. Ian is the first to physically assault her. And then in the end he does it again, while also being a bit violent toward Sunny & Jared. Of course, Ian ends up pretty near perfect with his perfect understanding and perfect kindness and perfect love. But I will accept this because I think that his perfect personality fits with the gentle, loving, peaceful personality of Wanderer.---While still cheesy, there were bits that were not romance-based that were emotionally compelling. I felt Wanderer\u2019s fear about what she had to do in the end. In the tunnel on the way to Doc for the last time, when she asked Jared where everyone slept when it rained, my heart ached for her. I thought that was a lovely way of noting how much she still really wanted to find out about this world and how much she was going to miss and that life was going to go on without her. I know, I know, we are being emotionally manipulated, because if you don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to end before you even pick it up, you haven\u2019t read enough in life. But if you put yourself in the character\u2019s place when she has a very clear idea of what is going to happen, it\u2019s pretty sad.---The thing that made me love this is that it is not a romance. It is a story about humanity with romance thrown in. I like looking at humanity through alien eyes. I like learning what it means to be human with Wanderer. I like the interactions between Mel and Wanderer. I like that Wanderer picked up sarcasm from Mel. I love how absolutely confused she initially is by humans. She views humans as violent, hateful creatures. She is confused when they feed and protect her. This completely goes against her view of humanity.I like how we perceive the humans through her eyes, how we get an idea of their motives from her which she is normally wrong about, and then we slowly see the change. This is seen especially with Doc.I enjoyed seeing how Wanderer reacted to humans and how her perception of them changed. She goes from being terrified of humans to constantly surprised and confused by how good they end up being to loving them and embracing her own humanity. But throughout it she is ashamed of betraying her kind and feels like a traitor. She constantly second guesses herself, whether it\u2019s in favor of the humans or the souls. It\u2019s not until the end when she really accepts that maybe what she does is wrong, but if it brings about good then it\u2019s the best thing for her to do.---I like the question of how much of yourself comes from some ethereal personality/soul and how much comes from your physical body. What makes us human? What parts of us do people fall in love with? Are we more physical, spiritual, emotional? It\u2019s a bit cheesy (have I said that enough?), but I like the idea portrayed when Ian says, \u201cIt\u2019s not the face, but the expressions on it. It\u2019s not the voice, but what you say. It\u2019s not how you look in that body, but the things you do with it\u201d (p. 397, ARC). And then we get to see Wanderer in two different bodies which change her a bit. We have weak v. strong, etc. When in Mel\u2019s body, Wanderer feels a physical longing for Jared but an emotional one for Ian. After she is put in a new body, she still loves Jared. Melanie occasionally seems overly familiar with Ian before remembering who she is. Jared stares searchingly and confusedly at Wanderer. What makes someone who they are? What part of a person do others connect with?---There are a lot of small touches that really pleased me. I love how people act and react in this book.I thought it was hilarious when Wes (?) said, \u201cYou may have taken the planet, but you\u2019re losing this game,\u201d when they were playing soccer. That's just funny to me. If you can't use humor to cope with the apocalypse, you'll never make it.A reaction that rings completely true is when, after Wanderer walks in on the dissections and is absolutely horrified, the guys are confused about why she is so upset when they were sure to cover the bodies so she couldn\u2019t have seen anything. However, they only covered the human bodies. They still see the souls as alien and other which negates understanding and compassion.I love what happens in the following bit: \u201c\u2019Ah,\u2019 the seeker\u2019s familiar voice moaned from the human body. \u2018Ah.\u2019 / The room went utterly silent. Everyone looked at me, as if I were the expert on humans\u201d (p. 553, ARC). Of course that is how they would react when she is the one who knows how to bring the humans back!---One theme of the book is belonging. What makes one belong? Wanderer does not think she belongs in the cave because she is not human. Many of the humans agree. But she becomes part of the community, and her friends, who have gotten to know her and thus care about her, believe she belongs. Jeb never calls her \u2018it\u2019, and as the others get to know her they stop doing this. Lacey is instantly accepted by many of the humans because she is human (or becomes human again). But she has a hateful personality, and most of the main characters do not like her. Jeb refers to her as \u2018that creature\u2019. So what makes us belong somewhere?---I think the characterization is actually not terrible.Ian, for instance, initially comes off as cruel and violent (he tries to kill her), but he\u2019s just reacting to his world being taken over by beings who want to basically kill all humans. We see that he has the capacity to be kind, to gain perspective, to learn to understand. Granted, it seemed a bit incongruous to go from Killer to Most Compassionate & Loving Person Alive Ever in such a short time, but I'll take what I can get from Meyer.Even Kyle is developed, though it mostly comes up in the end. Initially, he is just the villain of the story, but once Sunny is brought in we see that, yeah, he is rash and selfish and arrogant and angry, but he can be gentle and kind. And we don\u2019t see this 180 done on his character where all of a sudden, out of the blue, he is capable of love. We know he had a girlfriend before this all started. Someone, at some point, must have seen some good stuff in him. And his grief at losing his world is manifest through anger and violence towards those who destroyed it. Sunny looks at him as her protector, but he doesn\u2019t jump into a relationship with Sunny. He wants Jodi back. But through his interactions with Sunny, he gains understanding. He is confused by her reaction to initially meeting him and is surprised he can be so kind to her. He is compassionate when she realizes what is going to happen and is terrified, he didn\u2019t realize it would be that hard. Once Jodi doesn\u2019t come back, he has Sunny put back in her body, and he takes care of her. But he\u2019s confused by it all; he doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing or how to have a relationship with her. As shocked as I am by this, Meyer is able to create a character that grows but still remains himself.---I did have a problem with the ending. It\u2019s just too neat and happy. While I was amused and pleased that Jared held a knife to Doc to get him to save Wanderer, it\u2019s way too pat of an ending. Of course, you knew it would happen from the beginning, but I have to wonder whether it would be a better ending to just let her die. She\u2019s lived, she\u2019s learned, it\u2019s her time to go. Life and love go on even in the face of death, as Meyer reminds us numerous times. Show us how the humans cope, how they do on their own once she\u2019s gone. Of course, she is the main character of the book, so maybe allowing her to continue learning how to be human is not such a bad thing. And we know how Meyer hates making her characters suffer any type of consequence..."}, {"userName": "Nataliya", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya", "userReview": "I must be a masochist.

I kid you not. **** Well, what else did I expect from a woman who created sparkly virgin vampires??? Hanging my head in shame. ****** In my defense, here is the quote from this trainwreck book: \"Perhaps without the lows, the highs could not be reached.\"  Maybe I expected the highs (just teeny-tiny highs) after Twilight the sparkly book I don't speak of? ******** This definitely had the aforementioned lows, but also a conspicuous absence of highs. And it didn't even have the unintentional hilarity of Twilight sparkly series. WAAAHHHHHH!!!!! -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEXTRA! EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT!\n\n There will be a movie. It IS happening (unlike the book, in which nothing is). Ok, it's old news, but I am behind on my pop culture. The important thing is - the movie stills are out. And they highlight the very important way in which it differs from Twilight - the male love interest is wearing a *gasp* SHIRT!!! In both pictures. Proof:-------------------------------------------------------------------------Alright, enough of the silliness. Let's get to business. This book COULD HAVE HAD potential. The premise can be interesting - our planet overtaken by mind-controlling centipedes souls, it takes people a while to realize that the invasion had happened, and the resistance emerges. Add to it that the invaders are apparently looking for little more than world peace - and this has the beginnings of a fun sci-fi-ish story. Alas, that didn't happen.**************Our lovely protagonist, ladies and gentlemen! (My vision)\nLet's immediately clarify - this \"sci-fi romance\" (as I have seen it described) is neither sci-fi nor romance.\n Instead we have a watered-down story of sometimes angry overprotective men pushing around and ordering around the helpless, meek, anxious, and \"selfless\" heroine - and occasionally carrying \"their women\" around (as all men are prone to doing in Ms. Meyer's books). There is a lot of brooding, glaring, staring, whispering, and murmuring (was Ms. Meyer paid extra for every instance of \"murmur\" in the book? It would seem so). The narration is weak, lazy, and overly dramatic. The characters are caricatures. Pages and pages go by without ANYTHING happening. Boring. YAWN.This book deserves ZERO stars. It is to literature what Gigli was to movies (Anyone remember that awfulness? Probably not, as I was likely the only sane human so saw it. Again - masochism). Your time is precious; please don't waste it on The Host. Do anything else instead - like watching paint dry, which still would be more enjoyable.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Edited to add (in bewilderment): This \"book\" has a 3.86 rating on GR.

I put my name on the hold list at the library for The Host, however, because I wanted to see if Stephenie Meyer had improved in her storytelling. I'm happy to say, \"Yes, she did. To a point.\"I would like someone tell me what her fascination is with sappy, overly dramatic dialogue, 17-year old girls and over-protective older men who carry them while running? Because there are some definite similarities here.I find it interesting that this novel is pegged for \"adults\" where the Twilight novels were pegged \"young adult\" as I don't see a great deal of difference, except for one main fact: Wanda and Melanie are likeable. Thank goodness. If one of them had shown up as whiny and annoying as Bella, I never would have finished the book. Well, I would have finished it, but only to say, \"I told you so.\"While I found a lot of similarity to the Twilight novels in her storytelling and in the details (over-protective older men, teenage girls, dramatic sappy dialogue, etc.) this was a much better story. Far more developed than I would have expected. It still takes her a long time to get to her main points, but I wasn't as bored with this one in the beginning as I was with Twilight.I found the storyline fascinating: that aliens who invade other planets and take over the species, invade earth and take over the human bodies and then live as humans. Wanda is one of those aliens, a \"soul\" who takes over Melanie's body, only to find out that Melanie isn't quite ready to give it up. This is where Meyer's storytelling has improved. She crafted a story where the romance was secondary to the main plot, and I think that is why this book is so much better than her earlier attempts. She explores the idea of a person's soul or spirit and how an individual is defined as much by that spirit as by their physical body.I thought her character development was well done. I liked these characters. I cared about them. I don't need to tell you that I never cared about Bella. I enjoyed the complexities that the storyline created. Wanda was affected by Melanie's memories and feelings and couldn't help but love the man Melanie loved. Then, when she found herself caring for a different man, the conflict is believable. The humans have a difficult time accepting Wanda, but when they do, she truly becomes one of them.The novel ends neatly, with hope. Predictably there is room for a sequel, which I no doubt expect.I'd actually re-read this book. I won't re-read the others."}, {"userName": "Ariana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3564852-ariana", "userReview": "\u201cIt\u2019s not the face, but the expressions on it.It\u2019s not the voice, but what you say.It\u2019s not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it.You are beautiful.\u201d\nI give this book 5 stars because is just such an amazing book. I really, really love it!At first sight it looks like it's a book about aliens, but in reality it's about the human kind and it's questioning how much humanity remains in us all. It's a book about survival, about love (so many types of love: loving yourself, loving the planet you live on, loving your family, your friends), about finding yourself... a book about trust, friendship and faith. It starts kind of slow, but as you get through the story you can see how amazing it can be... so captivating, so entertaining.The main characters are Melanie and Wanda (the body and the soul) and they take you in a journey not only to find the people they love but to find themselves, to understand the reasons to lose everything for love, the reason to give your life for the people you can't live without. \nThere is enough action to keep you reading, but the story is deeper than that, it's not about what the characters do but why they do that, it's not about whom they love but why they can't resist the feeling, it's not about what they say but about what they think. This book is all about emotions, and reading about how the characters feel in every scene makes the story so real, so true... you can feel the pain, the anger, the faith, the love, the hope... it's a carousel of emotions and that is what makes this book so good, because it's just so close to your heart.If you are looking for adventure and lots of action and UFOs this is not a book for you, but if you are looking for an emotional, tear-dropping story this might be the one.

Unfortunately, those cannot be precisely translated into the English language.Holy Crap. HOLY CRAP!! I can't even process my thoughts to write a review for this. This book was so stunning, so amazing, so crazy good that I can't even describe it. XD I'm extremely impressed of Stephenie Meyer. This beats Twilight by a long shot; it's SO much better. She writes so much better in this book, and the complex, in-depth plot is nothing compared to Twilight's shallow one.The idea is so cool. The characters are awesome and lovable. Stephenie Meyer is incredibly skilled with emotion; that's her strongest suit. She writes emotion in a way that makes you feel everything the character feels. When the character is in pain, the reader is in pain too. Meyer writes love in a way that makes you love everything and everyone the character loves with a strong passion. Even though he was just a character, I loved Jamie as strongly as if he was my own brother. And I was in love with Ian as strongly as if I was Wanda and he was actually real. Stephenie Meyer is a queen of emotion; I don't think anyone can write it like she can.This was just so much better than Twilight, and that was so relieving. Even though I enjoyed Twilight, it's nice to see that the same author is capable of writing something that isn't shallow in the slightest, and writing something so much better than Twilight. This book just blew me away.I actually cried at the end. In fact, I cried several times throughout the book, it was so good. :) The funny thing is, I didn't cry at the end because of the reason that everyone else cried. I cried because what everyone thought was the end of the book, WASN'T the end. I cried because Meyer changed it from the perfect, bittersweet sad ending, to a happy-dovey ending. I wish she made the ending the chapter before the last, the one before she skipped pages in the book. (I'm trying not to spoil things here ;D.)Apparently, Meyer is making a second book. I kind of wish she wasn't. While it would be nice to read the next one, I feel like The Host would be best as a stand-alone novel, and to make it into a series would just ruin it. This is a storyline that would best not be continued. I don't know.Anyways. The Host is a phenomenon and everyone who hasn't read it must go get it now. It is an essential read.

I'm a huge fan of Stephenie Meyer, she's one of the authors that made me want to start writing, but I couldn't possibly be as skilled of a writer than she is. She's incredible!I loved the Twilight series but others hated it. Team Jacob all the way!I don't really watch science fiction movies other than Alien, but I genuinely enjoyed this book. It took me awhile to get into it considering I know what happens, but I wanted to see the things that are in the book that might not have happened on screen, and to be honest I felt that it should have been the other way around. I should've read the book first and then watched the film, but that's just me. I always tend to jump on the bandwagon. When I read books, I love a heroine that's strong and a bad-ass. I refuse to read a book that has a weak heroine who let's people walk all over her, it actually makes me really angry when that happens.

Here they call themselves \"souls\", while the rebel humans who have slipped through the net call them \"parasites\". They are silvery, ribbon-like sentient creatures small enough to hold in two hands, covered in feathery antennae. Inserted into the back of a host body's skull, they take over a host's mind and motor functions to the point that the host's mind is completely subsumed: in effect, killing them.That is, until Earth, where the hosts fight back.Wanderer has lived full life cycles on nine other planets - a record among her kind - before taking a human host, a young woman called Melanie. Unfortunately, Melanie's not going away without a fight, and on top of the gamut of new and intense human emotions Wanderer must contend with, she also struggles to take complete control of her host and find the memories Melanie's keeping from her - memories of her brother Jamie and the man she loves, Jared. They'd managed to elude the alien takeover, until Melanie was caught. As Wanderer gradually gets to know and understand Melanie, she dreams more and more of Jared and Jamie until she finds herself ruled by Melanie's desire to find them, a desire stronger than the need to keep them safe from the parasites.While the story is very different from Twilight, the writing is much the same, and there are certain qualities in the characters that are becoming almost Meyer trademarks. I can already hear the same complaints and criticisms as I've read regarding the other series, but I'm not sure what these people are expecting - highbrow literature? The earth to move beneath their feet? Some people are never happy, and will often read a book determined to hate it. With one book they complain that something was mentioned and then seemingly forgotten, in another that something was repeated too many times. Personally, I didn't have a problem with the repetition in Twilight and I don't have a problem with it here.I think the first readjustment to my assumptions was with the alien race and Wanderer in particular. When I read about the book last year, I assumed the aliens are aggressive and cruel and the humans would be portrayed as humane and vulnerable. That's how it usually goes, after all, though I don't care for it. The opposite is true here however: the humans are portrayed as greedy, deceitful and violent - which we are, pretty much, especially when cornered - while the souls are kindly, generous, non-suspicious, terrified of humans and - apart from the Seekers - couldn't harm a fly. Especially Wanderer. It's not easy having a pacifist as your main character and narrator, especially one who's easily scared. But Wanderer has her moments of strength too, and resourcefulness, as well as her moral dilemma which is what really carries the story.Regarding the other characters, I really didn't like Jared, and Wanderer's attraction to him is one of the weakest points of the story. The point is made that she loves him because her body, Melanie's body, loves him and responds to him, and her mind too in a way. But it just didn't gel for me, probably because he doesn't come across well. His own dilemma - that the woman he loves is trapped inside a body ruled by an alien - gives him some excuse, but really, what's this thing Meyer has about women loving men who treat them horribly? Edward was pretty mean to Bella in the beginning, remember? Anyway, I liked Ian early on and it was pretty frustrating, the way Wanderer treated him etc.The themes of the novel are pretty obvious, and definitely well-meaning, but still interesting. Questions of whether humans deserve to live on when we are so cruel to each other, and waste resources etc. The souls don't even use money, they take only what they need, and treat everyone with the same kindness. This raises the age-old issue of individuality, which is often the victim - and the ace up humans' collective sleeve - in such stories. The same theme was explored in Scott Westerfeld's Uglies/Pretties/Specials trilogy, for example.Definitely one of the things I liked about this book was the conflict between Melanie and Wanderer, having two minds in one body with one more dominant than the other. It reminded me of Annon and Riane in Eric van Lustbader's Pearl Saga, a boy in a girl's body whose individual identities are slowly merging yet still conflicting - written so well, I think Lustbader created a whole new gender. It's simpler here because they're both female, but other problems arise because of it - like loving the same man, or of Wanderer wanting to respond to Ian but unable to because her host body lusts after another man. Among other things ;)Because I didn't like the characters as much as I did in Meyer's Twilight series, I didn't fall in love with this book. It's an oft-times exciting story, with moments of tension and uncertainty, but I would have liked to understand the souls more - I didn't really understand where they came from or how they came to be, it's kind of like the chicken-or-the-egg: if souls can't survive without host bodies, how did they come to be? How did they get inside their first hosts? - and it was a tad bit heavy-handed on the moralising. Not enough to annoy me, but it's there nonetheless. In short, if you enjoyed the Twilight series, you'll probably enjoy this because it means Meyer's style won't aggravate you; if, on the other hand, you didn't enjoy them, and you have bitched and moaned about her writing style like so many other people, I'd rather you didn't read The Host, not 'cause your criticisms will be wrong, but because you're missing the story. I should know, I've bitched and moaned about books I don't like often enough before. But I don't usually go on and read more books by the same author, unless I'm hoping they'll have improved. And I think Meyer's writing is improving, but it is what it is: simple, unadorned, reflective, introspective (but not too much), and clear. Even the repetition is necessary, which I think is true of Twilight as well."}, {"userName": "Railee", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/419847-railee", "userReview": "Talk about an emotional roller coaster!!!!

Very much so, in my opinion. Was it weird? YES! Were the characters well-developed? ... After the first half of the book, yes, I suppose.The Host is about a species of aliens who call themselves Souls. They are born without bodies and can not live very long without one, so they live like parasites inside the bodies of other creatures, completely taking them over. These \"souls\" come to earth and take over the bodies of mankind, living peacefully as they experience the new world around them. The main character of this book, through whose eyes the events of the story are witnessed, is a soul named Wanderer who takes over the body of a young woman formerly known as Melanie. When Wanderer realizes that Melanie is still alive inside of her body, she tries desperately to fight her out, along with the painful and wonderful memories of the man Melanie is in love with. Eventually, Wanderer falls in love with this man, too, through Melanie's memories and the two of them set out to find him.I don't usually read Science-fiction, and so maybe that's the reason I found this book so odd. I wouldn't have picked it up, knowing the storyline as I did, except that my sister had it in her room and I was bored. As weird as the whole alien/possession thing was and is, I found that it was interesting to read about. It was interesting to read the descriptions of human emotions through a character who's never felt them before. This book was VERY EMOTIONAL! Happy, sad, angry, jealous, confused, hurt, obsessed, offended, frustrated, loved, hated, admired, rejected... all feelings were vividly described and painfully lived as I read this book. It ended the way I wanted it to, which made me happy, but.... I don't know. There were just a few things I would have changed had I been the editor of this book.1) Stephanie Meyer seems to be developing, more and more with every book, a strange fascination with writing graphic make-out scenes that are slightly embarrassing to read. There were two in this book that were completely pointless, like she just wanted to write them. There was one that was almost pointless, but I can see why she would think it necessary. I'm not against kissing in books or anything like that, but there is such a thing as overdoing it to the point of ridiculousness.2) I wished that she would have spent less time with the first half of the book and more with the near-end of the book. I wished there would have been more after \"the problem\" was fixed. Hopefully anyone who's read the book knows what I mean by that. To me, the book really got interesting near the middle, and it kind of dragged a little before that. But it wasn't really boring.... Just... uneventful....That's it! This book was uneventful for how long it is! But I wasn't ever bored, exactly. Stephanie Meyer is too good of a writer to allow that. There was always something I enjoyed about it, but there was just enough that was weird or not quite right about it that I can't say that I loved it.In conclusion: I don't know exactly what I think of this book. It was enjoyable! I'm not sorry that I read it! But it was weird, and I would have liked it better with a few changes here and there."}, {"userName": "Khurram", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25493797-khurram", "userReview": "I really did enjoy this book. It is narrated in the same style at the Twilight book in the first person. The things that make this book really good are the internal dialogue between the main characters Melanie and Wanda. I am told that this did not work too well in the movie, but as a book it makes great interesting reading.The story an alien invasion has happen we the humans have lost or have we? The Aliens call themselves Souls; they think it is the closest translation from our language. They are parasitic/symbiotic in nature. They are inserted into through the back of the neck and attach themselves to our brains and control our bodies. They have done this on at least eight other different planets. The society seem to have 3 classes Healers their Doctors, Seekers their police force, and the general populace (they are never referred to as more then Souls). Their occupation seem more a seeking of knowledge and experiences that maliciously or ambitious. The aliens so not seem to be well armed and do not like violence. The Invasion has been more of stealth slowly taking over people and their neighbours before any realised. Most of the technology seems to have been concentrated on healing and space travel.The reason I ask the question is did ne lose is because on all the other planets they have conquered they have never met a species that is a conflicted, emotional and diverse all at the same time. The other species offered little or no resistance and the aliens were just accepted. The Aliens seem to have no personality of their own in their natural states. The personalities seem to be the sum of their experiences from previous and current hosts. The only real method of telling if some have been taken over is their eyes.Melanie is one of the few humans left, till she is captured, she tries to kill herself rather then submit to being taken over, but the aliens heal her body. The Soul she is bonded with is called the Wanderer, because of all the worlds she has visited but never settled on for more than one hosts life time. Usually this is it the Soul takes over and replaces the Host with full access to their memories and carries on living their lives. Melanie being the fighter she is refuses to go quietly he is presence and voice constantly with the Wanderer. As the story goes on we find this is happening more and more strong will Humans refuse to be giving the aliens' full control.Using or being led by Melanie, Wanderer finds possible the last outpost of pure Humans. If she has any hope of surviving Wanderer must make peace with Melanie; then together they must try and convince the humans they mean no harm. Both sided must put aside their preconception of the other and try to find common ground. This is a great story about the human spirit. The language is definitely at a higher level than Twilight probably because Meyer has realises her fans have grown older. Meyer's writing style has a good story telling flow to it. I enjoyed reading the whole book. The only think I would grip about is the lack of action in the book; there was more action in the football game and the bonus chapter \"Alone\" then in the rest of the book. However she was writing more for emotional content then action. This is an intelligent different story, seen through the eyes of both Humans and aliens."}, {"userName": "\u2665Christina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52207144-christina", "userReview": "5 Happy Heart \u2605's\u201cIf I was given the choice between having the world back and having you, I wouldn't be able to give you up. Not to save five billion lives.\u201d'The Host' is a hit or miss for readers, you either LOVE it or HATE it. I think it's got a bad rep because of Twilight, and that's a bummer. As for me, I FREAKING LOVEEE ITTT!!! I'd pick The Host 100 times over the Twilight series any day! Growing up I was a very shy kid and I didn't like reading out loud in class. I was slower at reading and didn't always know the right words. So in turn, I hated reading. I despised it really. Witch it crazy because reading is such a big part of my life now. I was in my early 20's when I found my love for books and It's all because of this book right here!!! The Host was instrumental in finding that part of me. The Host will always...always have a special place in my heart. It will always be one of my all-time favorites! I have read this book 5 times if that's any indication. I was hooked from the very first page. I love the characters, the plot, the writing style, everything...I love everything about it! All the relationships are strong, the love is electric, and you feel everything they feel. This book has all the feels and it was such an emotional read for me. I cried a LOT, but I also smiled and laughed. The ending was done in such an incredible way. It left me feeling complete and I'm a sucker for HEA's\u2665.

Seriously, why? I understand we are in love with Twilight, but it's not a good enough reason to support this mediocrity. I was extremely disappointed by Breaking Dawn, but decided not to be a hater and give SM another chance. So I opened The Host. I have to say, I have never had to put this much effort into reading a book in my life. If I didn't know who SM was, I wouldn't even bother to read after page 10, it was that boring and uninspired. But because of SM, I continued on, especially after some people told me that it would get better after about 250 pages. Oh boy, were they wrong! I was more like 500 pages. It took me 3 days to get through first 100 pages (to compare, it took me probably about 3 days to read Twilight, New Moon, and Eclipse). After that I just skipped through the rest of the book within a couple of hours. You can literally read every 50th page and not miss anything! There is absolutely nothing going on in this book! Pages and pages of conversations between Wanda and Melanie. And both these characters are so undeveloped, it's hard to tell them apart. In fact, it's hard to get attached to any character in this book! They all are so flat and dull. This book is marketed as sci-fi/romance novel. Trust me, it is neither. The sci-fi backdrop of this novel is laughable. Altruistic \"souls\" that save planets from cruel species, among these \"cruel species,\" believe it or not, are: Flowers, See Weeds, Bats... It is just plain ridiculous! There is very little romance in the book either. A couple of kisses between underage girls and older guys is all you get, in spite of the fact that this is SM's \"first adult novel.\" \"Adult\" conversation goes as far as discussing that a couple of characters can't have sex because she is too young (of course!) and they don't have contraceptives. Give me a break! So many reviewers say that this book has a deep meaning, that it shows \"what it means to be human\" and demonstrates that we can \"extend the status of \"human\" to other entities,\" etc. I think these people have never read actually good books. In fact, I don't think they have ever read anything but Twilight before. This is definitely the end of my love affair with SM's writing. I think she struck gold with Twilight, the rest of her creations are just plain bad. You may disagree with me, but this is the reality."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "Not a bad sci-fi story. A little like the Twilight series - some of the formula poured over into here. I feel like the creativity level was a lot higher as Meyer was working with an alien species of her own creation and not necessarily the myths and legends of the vampires and werewolves.My only issue is that it seemed to drag on a bit at times. This was only compounded by its length. This is one of those books that I think could have benefited with a trimming.I think this book was advertised as Meyer getting away from YA, but it is pretty much YA. This is an interesting place to bring up the argument about what makes a book YA? I have seen some books designated YA and it seemed to be only because one of the main characters is a teenagers. Other times, there are books where all the characters are adults that feel so YA it's not even funny! Thoughts?I don't think you can go wrong with this one if you are looking for a thrilling, sci-fi, YA novel - if you don't mind a bit of filler!"}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/781708-kris", "userReview": "I am having so much trouble reading this book, and who am I to judge? I am just a lowly reader and spender, not a publisher. But there is just something about the writing in this book that is making the voices in my head scream. I had the same experience when I read \"Twilight.\" Ms. Meyers is over-the-top descriptive where there is no need to be. If I had to count how many times she wrote, \"I winced.\" or, \"I flinched.\" or, \"I sighed.\" or, \"Ian sighed.\" I bet it would be in the hundreds. She has added TOO many 2 word sentences that would drive most English Professors to madness. I know it is driving me to madness, and I only worked for English Professors.It has gotten to the point to where I may have to set this book aside and move on to something else before I can come back and finish it. If I didn't have the policy of \"no book left unread,\" I would toss it aside. But alas, it is not in my genetic makeup to leave a book unread.Dang.ONE WEEK LATER:Ok, I stuck it out and finished the book. I can't say that I like it much better than what I said above. I don't know why this was classified as an adult novel. It read way too much like her Twilight series without a lot of complication. Her relationships and inward character battles are exhausting and juvenile. I do have to say that maybe my expectations were a little too high for this book and that is why I am disappointed. However, I will end with this: who is the one getting books published? Not me, so what do I know.

DEAD! <3 Everybody, we have THE HOST TEASER TRAILER in this world now.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUkE5Q...First things first. Dear Author,Do you want readers to have an optimistic opinion about you? Do you want to be normal and popular again after your dramatic fail, you know what I am talking about, of-course, The Twilight series? Here are three steps to make your life better again. Tell all the publishers to stop printing The Host.STEP NO 1- Change the cover. The eye is just too creepy. STEP NO 2- Change your name on the cover to, \"Bad author gone good- in the human world\"STEP NO 3- \nERASE\n The following line, \"Author of the twilight saga\" And then let them print. I ensure you, The host will sell more than you have ever expected or imagined. Yours truly, Saniya.P.s... I still don't like you, get over it.Ahh. After reading this book for one whole week, I can finally say...I liked it. You: Hahaha, you are kidding me, right? You are talking about Stephenie Meyer here? Author of The 'twilight' saga, remember? Me: Hahaha, Sadly, I am not. -_-Let me show you a prove, \"Unexpectedly moving.... Stephenie Meyer's novels throb with an overwhelming emotional intensity.\" - ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTIONHere is the thing, whoever wrote this, was a really good human. The very first words said were my feeling, Unexpectedly moving and kindly notice the four dots, FOUR dots after that. The situation must be like:The guy/girl reading it, \"Oh, I will hate this book anyway.\"Few moments after reading this book, *Typing on the computer* Unexpectedly moving... \"Damn, what should I write next?\"COPY-PASTE-COPY-PASTE. ~overwhelming emotional intensity shit~ Her face, '=D' Net nowadays. Saves the day! :D Even after reading a future, dystopian novel, I liked it. (I hate dystopian novels like anything, nowadays) The book would definitely be confusing for readers who haven't read books based on the future or soul before, at first, but then it becomes easy to understand and follow afterwards. I think the only reason I finished this book so late was because the author wrote this book so slowly. One chapter consisted of her laying down, one of her eating, one of her feeling awkward and so on. This book could have easily been for about 400 pages if the author didn't use the pages unnecessarily on how the heroine was feeling and all.And after a few chapters, I also started noticing that the writing was somehow, forced. Not like, \"WRITE IT OR I WILL KILL YOU\" but like, \"how can I make this book much longer than it already is.\" Some situations were so not necessary. It clearly looked like she was writing this book for a movie. Anyway, surprise surprise... or not. Saoirse Ronan is playing Melanie Stryder in The Host movie which is gonna be released in 2013. =D I am so waiting for it! ^.^The story was good, nothing that I could explain and yes.I LOVE YOU IAN! =DMARRY ME! ^.^I HEART YOU! <3I, SANIYA, A HUMAN SOUL, LOVES YOU!I LOOKED UP ALL ABOUT YOU ON THE NET!I KNOW, I KNOW, I AM NOT A CRAZY STALKER!..actually I am... *hehe*GOSH, HOT! ^.^ Everyone wants Ian Somerhalder to be Ian. And if, IF he is cast-ed as Ian, If will die with joy and have tears in my eyes of pure happiness. Yeah, yeah. Give this book a chance, its really good, blah, blah, blah. And I will give this book 4/5 stars. :DBut seriously, don't make a trilogy out of this. Let it be a stand alone novel.

She absolutely refuses to let a little thing like being trapped in her own body stop her from getting back to her brother. And soon, Wanderer does not want to go back. She's found a home (and a human) that she wants forever. \nWhat was it that made this human love so much more desirable to me than the love of my own kind? Was it...Because these humans hate with so much fury, was the other end of the spectrum that they could love with more heart and zeal and fire? \nNormally, when character who is too good to be true (looking at you, Wanderer), it annoys me.  Not with this book. Wanderer might be nearly perfect, but her internal conflict and the external factors (i.e. Melanie, other humans) provide enough tension to keep her from seeming like a Mary-Sue.

Even though it was long, i still loved every page of it. I never read Stephanie Meyer before, but i love this book. She really is a good writer. The only downside that i had was that i watched the movie first - therefore i knew what was going to happen. But book was so much better, with more informations about Souls, and better characterization. And, one important thing: you will either love or hate this book.One thing also that i really loved was that it was not an insta love, no matter how it seemed. The whole book happens in a long period of time - months actually, but nothing felt extremely rushed. And it can also be said that this is actually a love fourangle - 3 boddies and 4 souls. This story is actually centered on romance and less on science fiction (if it can even be put as sci fi, because we only meet aliens...and find out about some of their worlds). \n\n \u201cWhat was it that made this human love so much more desirable to me than the love of my own kind? Was it because it was exclusive and capricious? The souls offered love and acceptance to all. Did I crave a greater challenge?...Or was it simply better somehow? Because these humans hate with so much fury, was the other end of the spectrum that they could love with more heart and zeal and fire?\u201d \n\n___________________________________________\n\nSTORY:\n\n___________________________________________World has never been more perfect - there are no wars, no hunger, no unecessary pain, no illness. But, the world belongs to the aliens called Souls. They are conquers and they are \"parasites\". They need hosts to live - otherwise they die. And when they discovered Earth which was slowly being destroyed, they thought it was perfect chance to save it. Therefore, they occupy it and start fixing the Earth. Souls are kind, caring, intelligent race, but can their good qualities compare to what they had done to human race? They destroy minds of humans and possess the bodies. Only a handful of people are left on Earth, the unpossessed ones called rebels. And they want to take their world back, but they can't do anything against them. To make things go as planned and to protect Souls, Souls placed Seekers to be something like a police for them. Seekers are the only one who are not honest, who lie and who hurt - and they are eager to find every human there is.This is a story about Wanderer, a Soul who was put into the body of Melanie Stryder, a rebel human. The thing that Wanderer didn't expect though was that Melanie is still alive and kicking in her mind. Melanie wants her body back, but she can't do anything about it and Wanda wants her gone, because the body belongs to her now. Melanie then shows her memories of Jared, her boyfriend and Jamie, her brother, and Wanda begins to realize that she slowly falls in love with those humans. And when she goes to try to find them, things don't exactly go as planned. The only thing left is to keep moving forward.___________________________________________\n\nCHARACTERS:\n\n___________________________________________\u2666 \n\n WANDERER/WANDA AND MELANIE/MEL:\n\n\n\n \u201cBody and soul. Two different things\u201d \n\nMelanie and Wanderer are both kind, caring and wonderful characters. They made me feel so much, both of them are the characters i really love, and i loved how the book was told from Wanda's perspective. Wanda, the Soul, is one of the most kind of them all. She is called Wanderer for a reason: she never settled on any planet, and she was on a lot of them. Earth is all knew to her, and human race is confusing to her as well...our emotions are not easy for her at the beginning. But, she begins to feel like Earth is the planet for her:\n\n \u201cThis place was truly the highest and the lowest of all worlds - the most beautiful senses, the most exquisite emotions.. the most malevolent desires, the darkest deeds. Perhaps it was meant to be so. Perhaps without the lows, the highs could not be reached.\u201d \n\nAnd even though she didn't like Melanie at the beginning, as can be said for Mel too, she starts loving Mel, and the other way around, until they became friends and sisters by souls.But, even if Melanie spammed her mind with Jared and Jamie, she can't really know how she feels. She begins to love Ian, but her body loves Jared....and it makes it so confusing to her. Melanie is fun, she is sarcastic, strong and amazing. And she is a fighter. She doesn't give up easily and her love for Jared and Jamie is so strong that she starts showing memories to Wanda, so she could understand. I loved Melanie, she was just awesome :)\n\u201cMelanie Stryder?\u201d he asked, addressing her.\nWe both started at the name.\nIan went on. \u201cI\u2019d like the chance to speak with Wanda privately, if you don\u2019t mind. Is there any way that could be arranged?\u201d\n\nOf all the nerve! You tell him I said no chance in hell! I do not like this man.\n\nMy nose wrinkled up.\n\u201cWhat did she say?\u201d\n\u201cShe said no.\u201d I tried to say the words as gently as they could be said. \u201cAnd that she doesn\u2019t\u2026 like you.\u201d\nIan laughed. \u201cI can respect that. I can respect her. Well, it was worth a try.\u201d He sighed. \u201cKind of puts a damper on things, having an audience.\u201d\nWhat things? Mel growled.\nI grimaced. I didn\u2019t like feeling her anger. It was so much more vicious than mine.\n\nGet used to it.\n\n\u2666 \n\n JARED:\n\nJared is Melanie's boyfriend. They met when Mel was robbing someone, and they both thought the other one was Soul... Except Jared noticed it first and he kissed her, which made Mel angry and she punched him (he deserved it).\n\u201cMy name is Jared Howe. I haven\u2019t spoken to another human being in more than two years, so I\u2019m sure I must seem\u2026 a little crazy to you. Please, forgive that and tell me your name, anyway.\u201d\u201cMelanie,\u201d I whisper.\u201cMelanie,\u201d he repeats. \u201cI can\u2019t tell you how delighted I am to meet you.\u201d And then, they slowly but surely, fall in love.But, when he finds out that Melanie is gone and that Wanda took her place, he becomes cruel and unforgiving. He hurt Wanda many times and he said many many unkind things. And it shattered both Mel's and Wanda's heart seeing him like that. In some way, i can understand what he felt, it's not easy when the person you love is gone. And that someone else took her place. But he didn't have to be that much cruel (no wonder why everyone is team Ian). And even after all of that, i started liking the poor bastard, and in the end i loved him. \u2666 \n\nIAN:\n\nIan is one of my favorite characters in this book. Even though he wasn't exactly kind to Wanda in the beginning (in that include him trying to strangle her), he grew to my heart. He regret what he had done to Wanda and soon starts seeing her as herself, not just the body. He starts to like her and eventually, he starts loving her.\n\n\u201cIt's not the face, but the expressions on it. It's not the voice, but what you say. It's not how you look in that body, but the thing you do with it. You are beautiful.\u201d \n\n\u2666 \n\nJAMIE:\n\nJamie is Melanie's little brother. He was forced to grow up earlier than he wanted to. He became like an adult, despite his young age. He wanted to believe that Melanie was still alive, he wouldn't accept it otherwise, and he is the one of the rare ones who thought that Wanda is wonderful person and that she should be given a chance...\u2666 \n\nEVERYONE ELSE:\n\nJeb was amazing. When he was young he found out about a cave, which fortunately, saved their lives by becoming a perfect hiding place for humans who survived. The motto he has is \"My house, my rules\" and everyone respects him. He believed in Wanda, he saw her as she is, he liked her from the beginning and he was kind to her.Kyle, Ian's brother, got on my nerves so many times, but in the end, i loved him too. Ian doesn't like him, and actually, no one really does, mostly because of his attitude and because he was irritating.Wanda's Seeker is one of the characters i don't know how to feel about. We find out about her, but for me she was just confusing. But she isn't a quitter and she knows what she is doing. And that makes her scary opponent.There are so many characters i wish to talk about, but i would be tempted to spoil and we don't want that to happen, do we? :D___________________________________________\n\nOVERALL:\n\n___________________________________________I love this book. And i am sad that it ended. But, i will surely read it again and again, because i want to be with Mel, Wanda, Ian and Jared again... I am also happy that there is going to be a sequel and i can't wait for it. \nThis review can be found on my blog: infinity-of-time.blogspot.com also known as..."}, {"userName": "Lina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4014494-lina", "userReview": "Unfortunately, the thing that drives me to write today is the poorly written book known as The Host, by none other than Stephenie \"Sparkling Vampires\" Meyer.\u00a0\n\n Now, I went into this book with lukewarm expectations. Many people have said that The Host is actually better written than The Twilight \"Saga\", which isn't really saying much if you really look at it. \n\nHowever, I held in my bias and decided to give it a try, besides after Sparkling Vampires how much worse can it possibly get? Good Lord I was so wrong, so, so wrong. So The Host is a Sci-fi/Romance novel for people who don't like sci-fi according to the writer and it shows from the second paragraph of the damn Prologue. The aliens (which are called souls) are described as such: \u201cBecause he was a soul, by nature he was all things good: compassionate, patient, honest, virtuous, and full of love.\u201d\u00a0 [Yawn]. So these souls are silver centipede-like creatures that are put into the bodies of humans since the souls need a host to live. Now you may be wondering, why are these aliens on Earth and taking over human bodies? The answer. To make it a better place. I'm not joking.These aliens are not here because they are lacking resources on another planet or because they are just that bad ass or because they want our women. It's because they saw how humans were abusing their beautiful planet because we are so mean and violent so they came over here, took our bodies and made the world a better place. Not to mention they [the aliens] have no flaws. Are you bored yet? Don't worry it gets worse.\u00a0 We are then introduced to our protagonist: Wanderer (Wanda). Named such because she has been on multiple planets in several hosts, such as the Bear Planet, Planet of Flowers, some Dolphin planet and something with Spiders that have three brains. I don't remember them because they are stupid. The lack of effort she put into the creativity of this world is so childish I really wanted to throw my nook several times. She doesn't even do the cheap thing and make the creatures or planet names the actual word but backwards. No she just calls the creatures whatever the closest human term for it is. I mean what kind of alien is a See-Weed?\u00a0\u00a0 Anyway, our protagonist \"Wanderer\" has just been put into the body of a member of the human rebellion force called Melanie (Mel) Stryder. Hmmm...that sounds an awful lot like Stephenie Meyer. Must be a small coincidence, like Bella Swan's appearance. Wanderer is troubled because the mean human girl won't let Wanderer enjoy her new body in piece and keeps popping into Wanderer. When she goes to her alien shrink (I shit you not) she says that the only time Melanie isn't quiet is when Wanderer is teaching at an alien university (again I shit you not). Due to Melanie's influence Wanda escapes her Seeker (our antagonist). You might be wondering what the fudge a Seeker is. Its not important. You might think it is, since you know one of them is our antagonist, but I can assure you. It's not important. Wanda then tries to find the place where Mel's Aunt and Uncle (Jed) are staying along with the other human refugees. Those including our two love interests, our \"mortality pet\" and the only man with common sense in the story (aka our second antagonist)  I could get into a chapter by chapter review of this story, but that would just bore you as much as the book bored me so I'm just gonna try and break this down as simply as possible. The problem with The Host isn't simply that it is poorly written, but that every single character in the book is idiotic yet we are supposed to like them. We are constantly being told how good Wanda is, how strong Mel is, how wise Jeb is, etc. Yet none of the characters ever show those qualities or better yet any common sense. We are dealing with a world in which almost all of humanity has been taking over by aliens and they not only allow Wanda to live, but try and make everyone in the human refugee compound like her. Those that don't are the bad guys and those that are are of course a tribute to their race. Towards the end, even Melanie loves Wanda. Melanie's brother and boyfriend all love Wanda. Why? Because she is good. It's no wonder the humans have all been taken over, they lack any common sense! The only one who did was Kyle, who was demonized for acting the way anyone with half a brain cell would act during an alien invasion, until the end when everyone decides that the aliens are good people doing bad things. (Groan).The problem with this is that Meyer just can not write this scenario well. The aliens are seen as these pure creatures who don't see what they are doing as wrong, yet they are supposed to be good, despite that they are living in pure ignorance to the suffering of an entire race. Then the humans are good only because they are the victims, not by their own merit because they are violent, brutish and lairs.\u00a0Wanda, who is supposedly abandoning her race for her love of humans, thinks of humans as brutish and even calls them monsters at one point. Yet all the humans still love her (except for two who are demonized) and change the way they act because of her. How does she win over the humans? By telling them stories about the creatures she's been on all the ridiculously named planets she's been on. Later on she wins over all the other stranglers by bringing them medicine. Which she only does because Mel's little brother Jamie stabbed himself in the knee with a knife and got an infection (which was the Doc's fault since he knew they didn't have any medicine and the safest thing to do after it was getting worse was to amputate). This might have meant more to me if it wasn't for the fact that the names of the alien medicines were as followed: Cool No Pain Heal Smooth CleanAwake Also, one of them is literally just glitter.Whoever said that Stephenie Meyer was creative must be feeling pretty silly right about now. But lemme get right to the romances, which, really are the plot of this story and the only thing complex for some reason.Ian, who is one of the blandest love interests I've ever read, just keeps going on about how sweet and pure Wanda is constantly. I mean constantly. The process of Wanda/Ian falling in love is just so disgusting. Not only because he continues to ignore the fact that it is not Wanda's body he's kissing and that Mel has a right to it, but he seems willing to kill his own brother to protect the very thing he's been fighting against. Why? Because she is good. He would rather have Mel go away and lose all rights to her body than allow Wanda to leave and stop being a parasite (her words not mine). He is a selfish prick who has no right to say that or call Jared selfish for wanting the woman (teenager) he fell in \"love\" with to be returned to her body. But that's towards the ending and I'll get to that after this romance crap.However, Ian/Wanda isn't nearly as backwards as Jared/Mel. Well, maybe it is. This couple has abuse written all over it. In fact, flashback shows that when they first met Jared was trying to kill her because he thought she was an alien. When he discovered she wasn't he was so happy he kissed her...then she kicked him (Recycled scene anyone). Then they later decide to be the new Adam/Eve and go look for Melanie's brother, Jamie, together. They stay in this house and after two weeks Mel is ready to give herself to him completely because who wants to be a virgin during the end of the world. When Mel decided to go in search of her cousin Sharon (which is how she gets captured by the aliens in the first place) she thinks that being without Jared would be like dying. By the way, she's seventeen and he's twenty-six.The romance doesn't end there because there is also: Wanda/Jared/Mel. Because of Mel's memories Wanda starts to fall in love with Jared. Jared of course hates Wanda (rightfully so) and promptly beats the crap out of her. This of course doesn't stop Wanda or Mel from loving him because they know that \"he has a right to be angry.\" Ugh. There are so many things wrong with this that I can not go into. Jared doesn't start to like or defend Wanda until he realizes that Mel is still inside Wanda. He realizes this by kissing Wanda, therefore making Mel jealous, therefore allowing Mel to control her body long enough to punch Jared ala first meeting.\u00a0 Yes, the romance is boring and trite, just like everything else in this damn book. There is no climax. Even when they find the Seeker, who does nothing, Wanda, in her immense goodness, finds a way to not only humanize the Seeker, but to rescue her. I'm trying my best to tell you what this book is about, but honestly it is about nothing. I'm going through my notes on the book and I have found nothing really worth writing about. The story is that bland and uninteresting. The characters are so badly written because Meyer is trying to force us to like her leads by making them perfectly flawless. Even Wanda, who starts off as a terrible liar, is a good enough liar to steal from an alien hospital. However, what really irritates me about this book is the ending. I was already irritated because the way the story was being set up was that we (the human readers) are supposed to be rooting for the body-snatching, world cleansing aliens because they are \"good\" and we are supposed to be seeing the human resistance as bad because humanity (as presented in this book) is incapable of respecting and taking good care of our beautiful planet. Then we are supposed to see that is wrong through Wanda's eyes. The problem is she doesn't believe that the aliens are wrong. She only feels bad for her adoptive family. Not to mention she doesn't care about any of her other host bodies because according to her \"none of them are as emotionally complex as humans.\" That is awful. Sure I don't care about the Dolphins and Spiders and certainly not the See-Weeds, but the way she can dismiss them their emotions and claim that they have no problem with having their bodies taken over is so pompous and arrogant I was to stop on Wanda's head. It gets worse. When Wanda decides that she wants to be a Love Martyr and wants to die on Earth, nearly everyone INCLUDING MEL wants her to stay. Ian of course is the most asinine of them all and says that they need Wanda more than Mel. AND MEL AGREES!\n\n However, let me get to the absolute the worst part that ruins every single character in this book. SO our Love Martyr decides to die and before she is going to be cut open the Doc says \"You are the noblest, purest creature I've ever met. The universe will be a darker place without you.\" [Page 555] GAG ME. But thats just the wind up, here's the pitch. Mel, Jared and Jamie take a soul girl and remove her soul to give Wanda a new body. ENTIRE POINT OF WANDA'S \"SACRIFICE\" WASTED! This is absolute worst book I've read since Evermore. It is so bad I did not care for any of the two character deaths that took place. The book is poison to the Sci-Fi genre. I don't care if it is for people who \"don't like Sci-Fi\", as a writer she should have a little damn respect for the genre that she is writing in. I am done with this book and to anyone who liked this book, please tell me why.  If anyone is looking for a story that has sympathetic aliens and a complex human character look no further:\n\n Final Grade: FI may not like Stephenie Meyer's other work, but I was trying to give her a chance in this book. After all writers get better the more they write don't they? Well this proved me wrong. People said the writing in this is better than Twilight, well I was too bored to notice. The story is just not interesting because it doesn't even seem like she's trying. From the dull alien names to the tacked on romance and cop out ending, this proves to me that Mrs. Meyer's writing has not only failed to improve, but she regressed by writing this book. Everyone who has been shielding her from constructive criticism needs to stop holding her hand. The only way she is ever going to get out of her comfort zone is to be told that her formula isn't working. Then again this book was on the NY Bestseller's list for Twenty-Six weeks. So either I'm wrong or the adult genre is taking a highway to hell. Which is frustrating because I have some good property down there. Melina's Notes: -So far (at the prologue) the story seems like it might be interesting. Curious about the girl and what the ugly worm thing is. Meyer is still using her prose, but so far don't want to die. Chap 1.) So are we supposed to be rooting for the aliens who steal people's bodies and then subject us to mindless internal dialogue? Chap 2.) So...we are rooting for the aliens? We are supposed to want them to take us over? Really Meyer? Sigh. I'm so bored. Chap 3.) Human Resistance. So there are humans who would prefer not to have their bodies taken over by aliens and they are the bad guys?| Melanie Stryder? Really?| Jared? I smell a love interest. Chap 4.) Another useless female lead. | Alright she knees him when he kisses her. Good Girl. | Liquid Sienna eyes? | So then Mel kisses him and its Love *Yuck* | It was all a dream. | Memory *gasp* Chap 5.) So there are shrinks for aliens? Alien college too? This is a comedy isn't it, cause its funny like a mo-fo. So...am I supposed to care that the alien is crying? Seriously, they are justifying the body-snatching cause humans are bad? | Christ shut up alien! It's not your body! Chap 6.) I don't care about damn see-weeds. Chap 7.) Boring chapter, but maybe the humans are going to be the heroes. Maybe... Chap 8.) Yes, saying you'd die is too melodramatic. 17 & 26 *Gasp* Why are Meyer's leads so ready to throw themselves at the first guy they meet. Chap 9.) So the alien now loves Jared. How shocking /sarcasm. Chap 10.) So aliens really think no one minds them stealing the bodies of other people/creatures. Chap 11.) The soul is finally having doubts about what she does. | *Dalek Voice* Evil humans must exterminate. Chap 12.) They didn't die :( Chap 13.) Killers? Your taking over their planet! Chap 14.) So he slaps her and she comes back? Idiot Melanie! Chap 15-16.) So because Jared is keeping them from being killed we are supposed to feel his pain? Melanie is a pushover. Chap 17.) I like Jamie, best character besides Kyle in the whole damn book. Chap 18- 23.) So they have her telling stories and somehow Jeb just knows Mel is there? Ian is sympathetic for some reason and Jamie is adorable. Humans are being painted in an annoyingly negative light. Chap 24-37.) All the humans in this story are idiots, total morons. They are allowing this alien to live with them. Jeb needs to be shot with his own gun. If he is considered to be intelligent then no wonder humans have been taken over. Jared is now a whipped prick along with Ian. Wanda is a stupid character who only cares about humans because of Mel's emotions. If she honestly felt bad she would give Mel her body back and not refer to the body as \"hers\". She and those perfect souls are the dumbest creatures on Earth. Yet they have no freaking flaws! Kyle is the only one with common sense and he's supposed to be the bad guy. He has every logical reason to want Wanda dead. Mel & Jared are a stupid couple. Chap 30-End) This story is so asinine. Wanda is an alien who hates her kind, but not really. Hates humans and finds them to be monsters for wanting to protect their own kind! (Facepalm) Stop calling the body yours. | Alien medicine names [Cool, No Pain, Heal, Smooth, Clean, Awake]. One of them is glitter. | Ian is so dull. | Melanie you are a turd and should go away, except take Mel with you. | Ian shut up please. | \"You are the noblest, purest creature I've ever met. The universe will be a darker place without you.\" [Page 555] Gag me for the love of Azula. | They took a human soul and used her to give Wanda a new body which goes against the whole point of her doing the one selfless act in this entire book. This is pure bullshit and I feel disgusted with every single character in this book. Even Kyle is dead to me.

OMG LONGEST BOOK EVER.This could have been an incredible book. The premise is AMAZING. Advanced aliens who call themselves \u201csouls\u201d conquer Earth by implanting themselves into their human hosts and taking over their bodies. Yeah, it\u2019s a \u201cbody snatcher\u201d theme. The alien who calls herself Wanderer has lived nine different lives on nine different planets as nine different sentient species\u2026 Awesome sci-fi stuff.I really wanted to like this. Duh, Twilight and all.But just imagine the annoying love triangle, only NO ONE is a vampire or werewolf! Pffft.AND.... half of the love... square... is two people in one body. Wanderer's new host on Earth is named Melanie. Wanderer discovers Melanie is not content to just let her take over. Wanderer is led to the life and people Melanie left behind. The resistance. Her brother. Her true love. New friends. A new romantic interest for Wanderer? (Yes, there is a disturbing weird love triangle between Melanie/Jared and Wanderer/Ian (Melanie and Wanderer being in the same body/mind.)ANYWAY. Like I said, COULD HAVE BEEN. Instead, it\u2019s a bloated 600+ filler/padded book with a lot of not-much going on and a bit of awesome plot.There is some good world-building, however, WAY too much of Melanie baking bread and doing chores with the humans, and I think I know why all that was added in. To make Wanderer (shortened to WANDA by Jeb \u2013 kind of dumb, I mean, how much harder is it to say Wanderer? Really?). Seems like a Renesmee thing to me. TOO MUCH FILLER. This book should have been edited better and at least a hundred pages could have been cut from this mammoth. There is just no reason for it to be so long. NO REASON. NO. Stop, Stephenie Meyer. Stop writing bloated books. I loved Twilight, but not even those books needed to be so freaking long. I actually loved Wanderer (no I will not call her Wanda. Sorrynotsorry). She was a good being, pure. She learned and adapted and was not rigid or cold. She evolved past her own species and accepted and embraced it. She was willing to share her host body, where everyone else of her kind would not dare. It wasn\u2019t even that she dared, she just transcended the idea that her species must conquer. I dug it.Sigh. HOWEVER. All the other BS in this book that padded it\u2026 Sigh.And then the \u201clove square\u201d blows up \nand we have the male romantic interests actually ASKING the other Wanda/Melanie personality to let the one they like \u201cout\u201d to talk\u2026\nI think I liked the baking bread and chores section better.The romantic leads sucked, but especially Jared. I hated him. No feelings whatsoever for him. Oh wait, except hatred.The resolution was stupid. Wanderer ended up being a wishy-washy perfect special snowflake. My least favorite SM book by far. I'll take Jacob/Bella/Edward angst any day. Imma go re-read Eclipse again.

She has lived on seven worlds before coming here. She is arriving toward the end of the alien invasion when very few humans remain. The aliens are known as \u201csouls\u201d and are a peace loving type that don\u2019t know of violence or lying.Very few humans remain on Earth. When the remaining humans are discovered, they are captured by Seekers - the closest thing to a police force the \u201csouls\u201d have. Once captured, they are prepared for implantation where a small cut is placed at the base of the skull and the \u201csoul\u201d is put in the body. The \u201csoul\u201d connects to the body and takes control. The first experience the \u201csoul\u201d has is the receiving of the host body\u2019s memories. Typically, the host recedes and leaves the \u201csoul\u201d alone to continue life as usual. For Wanderer, this didn\u2019t happen.Since the only humans left are ones that are rebels, placing a new \u201csoul\u201d into an adult has become risky. The rebels seem to resist the implantation since they know what is happening. The Wanderer was granted this request because of her experience on so many other worlds and has proven herself as a strong and brave \u201csoul.\u201d Melanie is the name of Wanderer\u2019s host and Melanie doesn\u2019t go away quietly.Melanie remains active and talks to Wanderer all the time. Melanie bombards Wanderer with her memories of life so much so that Wanderer feels the same feelings that Melanie did when she had control over her own body. Melanie hides the memories that Wanderer needs though. A Seeker has been assigned to Wanderer in order to get information about the human rebels that worked with Melanie. Melanie is strong enough to block those memories from her. Eventually, in a weakened state, Melanie allows something to slip through the wall she has constructed to keep Wanderer away from the people she loves. She shows her memories of Jared, the man Melanie desperately loves, and Jamie, her younger brother. These memories overwhelm Wanderer and she physically aches for Jared and Jamie herself. Melanie knows where they might have gone into hiding since she was captured. She convinces Wanderer to go search for them and when the chance presents itself she slips away from the Seeker and sets off to find the people THEY love.When Wanderer finally stumbles upon the rebels she is both elated and terrified. She is so relieved to know that Jared and Jamie are both alive and well, but at the same time, is frightened for her own life. Wanderer endures weeks of isolation and deprivation once in custody while the rebels decide what to do with her. Slowly some people warm up to her and begin to allow her some freedom around the hideout, but she is never alone. They are afraid she is there to get information to take back to the Seekers and then come back and capture them all. It takes a very long time for them to see that she has no intention of turning anyone in to the Seekers.The story is complex. Not only is there the issue of Melanie loving Jared and the Wanderer loving Jared because of Melanie\u2019s memories; we also have Ian, another member of the rebels. Ian takes it upon himself to become a permanent fixture in Wanderers life. He is friend and protector and begins to have feelings for her and her alone (not Melanie since he didn\u2019t know her prior to the invasion).The story ends on a note of hope. It is an emotional ride from beginning to end - all 631 pages. Any science fiction fan will enjoy this story, but I think Stephenie Meyer may have done for science fiction what she did for fantasy when she wrote Twilight. THE HOST is set in enough of a realistic setting that even people who aren\u2019t sci-fi fans will enjoy this story. I want to read it again, but I have so much else to read that I can\u2019t right now, but THE HOST is definately on my \u201cto be read again\u201d pile.
