It biases the judgment.Also, I now sometimes try to analyze people based on their shoes and pants when sitting on the subway. I have yet to ask anyone if I was accurate about my predictions."}, {"userName": "Rowan Wiese", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60754399-rowan-wiese", "userReview": "Time does not change great literature This was completely entertaining and no matter how old you are it's still great to read over the ones you enjoyed the first time.

My dad gave it to me, I can't remember if it was a birthday or Christmas gift, but regardless it's one of the best books I've ever been given. You just have to read a couple of pages and you fall right into Holmes and Watson's world; it's wonderful."}, {"userName": "Arah-Lynda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2016", "userURL":

to say I am glad I finally came to my senses.It is all here, every Sherlock Holmes story ever penned by Arthur Conan Doyle. \u00a0There are four complete novels and five books of case studies. \u00a0Relax I am not going to even attempt to review every one of these. \u00a0That would be tedious for me as well as you.There is no doubt that my hands down favourite of the entire collection was The Hound of the Baskervilles, but make no mistake I loved it all.According to Goodreads I started reading this collection on June 23 of this year and I am just now able to close off my review. \u00a0With the exception of the novels which I read straight through once I had started them, the balance of the case files I read in between other books. \u00a0I must say I truly enjoyed this approach and looked forward to dropping in to see what Sherlock was up to every now and again. \u00a0Sadly all good things must come to an end. \u00a0It was however an experience I shall never forget and I shall certainly miss Watson and Holmes. \u00a0I may have to go back and pay them a visit again sometime."}, {"userName": "Rizwan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2013", "userURL":

"userReview": "Caro Arthur Conan Doyle, So il che rapporto con la tua pi\u00f9 famosa creatura non sempre \u00e8 stato idilliaco. So che sei arrivato perfino a commettere un omicidio pur di sbarazzarti della tua onnipresente e impertinente creatura. Ma\u2026 sono contenta che ti sia ricreduto e che Sherlock Holmes, alla fine, sia sopravvissuto anche al suo peggior nemico: il suo stesso creatore.Ora, ci sono mille altre cose che vorrei aggiungere. Ad esempio, potrei dire di come abbia cominciato con \"Uno studio in rosso\" che avevo ancora una decina d'anni e come, nel corso del tempo, quei racconti e quei libri mi abbiano portato ad appassionarmi sempre pi\u00f9 alla letteratura gialla. Potrei dire di come, a Londra, mi sono fermata in contemplazione davanti alla statua di Sherlock Holmes nella famosa Baker Street, pensando al povero Watson, narratore, sempre in secondo piano, di gran parte delle storie di Holmes.Con un certo distacco, datomi anche dalle tante letture accumulate sulle mie spalle, potrei dire che non tutti i racconti sono usciti \"con il buco\" e che qualche storia \u00e8 pi\u00f9 appassionante e intricata di altre. E potrei dire di come, leggendo queste storie, sia arrivata a comprendere cos\u00ec in profondit\u00e0 i meccanismi della narrazione, da arrivare alla soluzione del caso insieme a Holmes (che soddisfazione!). Potrei dire che queste vicende rapiscono e incantano generazioni e generazioni di lettori da oltre un secolo (un sogno che ogni scrittore spera di raggiungere un giorno)! Potrei dire di come, nonostante in alcuni casi si trattasse di una rilettura, non abbia avvertito noia o insoddisfazione nel leggere storie gi\u00e0 conosciute. Ma dir\u00f2 solo una parola: grazie."}, {"userName": "Manny", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1713956-manny", "userReview": "For the Celebrity Death Match Review Tournament, Le Petit Prince (14) versus The Complete Sherlock Holmes (19)It was some time during the summer of 19__ that I received an urgent telegram from Holmes. Arriving at 221B, Baker Street, I was struck by how little he had changed. He was older, to be sure; but his eye was as keen as ever, and his enthusiasm not one whit abated by the passage of the years.\"I trust you have brought your passport, Watson?\" he said, in lieu of greeting. \"We depart for Algeria this evening. The cab will be here momentarily.\"\"But Holmes!\" I protested, as he hurried me down the stairs. \"What -\"\"We can discuss that once we are on the train,\" replied Holmes firmly. And, true to his word, he said no more until we were comfortably ensconced in the First Class carriage of the Dover Express.\"Now, Watson,\" said Holmes, after he had carefully packed and lit his pipe, \"I wonder if you have heard of a young Frenchman called Saint-E_____. An author and aviator.\"The rest of this review is available elsewhere (the location cannot be given for Goodreads policy reasons)"}, {"userName": "K.D. Absolutely", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "userReview": "So, I'm now done with reading this whole 2-volume 1,796-page Sherlock Holmes canon. I spent 10 months reading all the 4 novels and 56 short stories contained herein. I really liked the experience and I am proud of this accomplishment. My first time to read a canon. Before reading this, I thought that the word canon only applied to biblical works. Well, that was the first thing I learned upon adding this book in my currently-reading folder.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote in a classy classic manner and even if his settings were not familiar to me as a Filipino, I appreciated his stories because of the universal messages in them: love of a husband to a wife, a son to a father, a father to his child, etc; the evil in greed especially when it comes to riches and money; that men can be truly friends without homosexuality getting in-between; that we have to respect the people we work with; always be wary of the people around you; and that, if used in moderation, cocaine and morphine can actually make you sharper. I cringed while typing the last one.So, what are my takeaways from Sherlock Holmes? There are three:1. Logical reasoning. He is a keen observer. In almost every company I joined with, there is a safety program and one of the things they teach in the training is to stop and closely look up, down, left, right, front, back for every thing that we see that can cause an accident. I think that if all of us in the company will have that power of keen observation, all factories will have zero unsafe incidents. Not only that, because Holmes has that keen observation, he uses those things that he sees to link them to his hypotheses and when he applies his knowledge in forensics (having a background on medicine), to the things he observes, it results to his power of deduction.2. Ability to disguise. I am still to see any Sherlock Holmes television episodes or movies but this one makes the story unbelievable for a middle age man like me but interesting enough to engage me while reading. Sherlock Holmes can be anybody: a pheasant, a woman, an old man, a soldier, a dead person, etc. Not only that, some of his characters put disguises too. This fantasy element in the story is entertaining in my mind but it is the least in terms of the practical application of what I learned from Sherlock Holmes. For one, I could not freaking imagine myself dressed like a woman.3. Forensic skills. From the first few pages of the A Study in Scarlet when the very young Sherlock Holmes told Dr. Watson how to detect blood from the scene, I was mesmerized. Oh, I thought I knew it from my medical technology readings way back 3 decades ago. However, I am not practicing that profession so at times I already forget what I learned before. Sir Conan Doyle really puts his passion into each novel and short story because he incorporated what he learned from medical books but even history, travel and other sciences such as anthropology, handwriting analysis, weaponry, zoology and botany (I still remember the giant jellyfish). He must have been a very well-read gentlemen.My favorite novel of course is The Hound of the Baskervilles followed by The Sign of Four. My top 10 favorite stories are below. Interestingly, while typing this, I checked a website and all, except #1, of my choices are not among the Top 12 Sherlockians' choices haha.1.The Final Problem (Memoirs) - 5 stars2. His Last Bow (Last Bow) - 5 stars3. The Adventure of the Retired Colourman (Case Book) - 5 stars4. The Five Orange Pips (Adventures) - 4 stars5. The Copper Beeches (Adventures) - 4 stars6. The Naval Treaty (Memoirs) - 4 stars7. The Adventure of the Empty House (Return) - 4 stars8. The Adventure of Charles Augustus Milverton (Return) - 4 stars9. The Adventure of the Three Students (Return) - 4 stars10. The Adventure of the Devil's Foot (Last Bow) - 4 starsMaybe I am just strange but I always enjoy stories that either \"speak\" to me or at least \"surprise\" me. Anyway, I will definitely miss Sherlock Holmes. But I have to move on to Samuel Beckett."}, {"userName": "\u041d\u0430\u0442\u0430\u043b\u0438\u044f \u042f\u043d\u0435\u0432\u0430", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2018", "userURL":

The characters of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson become character studies, making you long for the little tidbits that provide more insight into their inner workings.This time around I took the time to look up some of the odder Victorian words and thereby expanded my vocabulary with words like shaw (a small wood or thicket), chandler (a retailer of provisions) and extravasate (to force out from the proper vessels, as blood, so as to diffuse through the surrounding tissues).There are other details that seem impossible to not notice: the fact that, despite Holmes and Watson being clearly hetersexual, their relationship is nevertheless odd, that Holmes was a high-functioning autistic (Asperger's, my guess), and that Watson was a terrible doctor, seeing as how he treated every patient with brandy regardless of their ailment.But it is indeed these quirks that make the characters seem more real, and make the tales and deductions that much more enjoyable."}, {"userName": "Alexis Hall", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19022440-alexis-hall", "userReview": "My impression of what a Sherlock Holmes' story is actually like.I came down to breakfast one morning to find my dear friend, Sherlock Holmes disembowelling a gerbil with a teaspoon.\"My dear Holmes,\" said I, \"is that really necessary?\"Barely glancing up from his gruesome task, he told me that it was. \"You see, Watson,\" he continued, \"there is matter that I believe may soon become illuminated not only to you but the whole of London society.\"\"Good God, Holmes!\" I cried. \"Whatever is this?\"\"Have patience, Watson,\" returned he. \"You will understand directly.\"Two days later, I came down to breakfast to discover my dear friend, Sherlock Holmes, dressed as a goldfish.\"Ah Watson,\" he greeted me. \"You remember the matter we spoke of the other day?\"\"I do, Holmes, I do!\"\"Well, it is even darker and more disturbing than even I at first realised.\"The next day, I came down to breakfast to discover my friend lying disconsolately among the bacon.\"Are you quite well, Holmes?\" I enquired.\"I have solved the case, Watson.\" He sat up, brushing a fried egg from the lapel of his dressing gown. \"Allow me to elucidate.\"By which I mean, everything happens very statically and in a quintessentially Victorian way.Holmes is a prick and Watson is a sycophant.

It made me aware of the structure of the stories, about similarities and patterns, and also about the relation between the original stories and the multitude of adaptations out there. Inevitably you come to these stories with a lot of preconceptions. What struck me the most was how close many of the adaptations are to the original stories. Even those that turn them into adventure stories aren\u2019t that far off the mark.

The idea? Some of the writing? The kernel of the character and Watson and 221B and Mrs. Hudson and so on? Absolutely. Holmes himself and his mysteries? Oh, God. I'm sure it was in some small part down to the fact that I listened to the entire blessed Holmes canon in an Audible \"Complete\" edition. I was happy about it, because it was narrated by Simon Vance, who has done such a magnificent job voicing Holmes in sequels by other authors. And I can in no way fault the audio. Simon Vance was excellent (except when he tried to sound American). The production was dandy. It just \u2026 seemed\u2026 endless. And apparently I had never read some of the canon before. I was under the impression I had, but I can state for fact that when suddenly \"A Study in Scarlet\" wandered off (for an eternity) into what was supposed to be the American Wild West\u2026 put it this way: if I had been reading this in print I would have been constantly checking the number of pages until the story got back to where it should be, Victorian London. It wasn't terrible \u2013 but dear lord was I uninterested. Then it happened again in \"The Valley of Fear\" \u2013 in some ways, almost identically: good man mixed up in a cult of heartless killers, but prevails to win the love of his woman \u2013 and I thought I'd lose my mind. Again, it might not have been so bad on paper, but listening to these two stories set in a poorly imagined and (I love you, Simon Vance, but) rather horribly accented America was stultifying. Too-late note to all the dead British authors I've been reading lately: all Americans didn't speak like that. (And, particularly, black Americans did not speak like that.) The biggest thing I find I do not like about Sherlock Holmes, the canon, is\u2026 Sherlock Holmes. I lost track of how many times listening to these stories that I muttered \"You bitch!\" under my breath. He is an obnoxious piece of work, Holmes is. Yes, of course he's brilliant. Yes, of course he is capable of levels of observation that most people are not. Know how I know this? BECAUSE HE TOLD ME. Over and over. Usually in the context of pointing out to someone either how pathetically inferior a third party was \u2013 or, often, pointing out to someone how pathetically inferior THEY were. Tact? Not Holmes's strong suit. To put it mildly. In fact, by the end of this long slog I decided that Holmes's strongest character trait was not his skill at observation or deduction but his pure hubris. He swans through these stories pointing out how he has developed his skills by working at them and honing them \u2013 and then constantly uses that as a brickbat with which to pummel those around him, especially the police, and most especially Watson. Modern adaptations aside, as I listened to his arrogance in his dealings with the police I kept picturing him in the setting of a modern non-Holmes adaptation cop show. Ever seen the tv show Blue Bloods? I'm picturing Donny Wahlberg's character faced with Holmes's high-handedness and insistence on primacy and contempt for everyone operating at a lower level. (Try it \u2013 it's funny.) And, in the end, it hit me: where exactly did all this much-touted supremacy get him? If these tales purportedly selected by Watson are the choicest among Holmes's non-classified cases, I'm \u2026 not impressed. Where Holmes's gifts seem to be most showcased is in his introductions to clients and police, and in showing off for the always admiring Watson: you came in on this train, you have a medium-sized dog, you play the harpsichord. But his case track record \u2026 isn't great, is it? I don't have the time or energy to run down the list to make an accurate count, but I was astonished at the number of cases in which Holmes's client does not survive the story. It seemed to happen over and over \u2013 nice young man comes to 221B, frantic and afraid; Holmes tells him all about himself before letting him tell his story, during which Holmes acts bored; Holmes tells him that yes, there is some interest in your story, I'll get around to it in a day or two, keep me posted on developments; young man goes off reassured that the great man is on the case (rather than utterly pissed off over the way he's been treated), and shortly dies. Then and only then does Holmes descend from his ivory tower to find the killer. Then there were a surprising number of cases in which Holmes does not actually contribute that much to discovering the solution to the mystery. Facts emerge independently of anything he does, or someone confesses, and he stands back nodding smugly \u2013 he knew that.And even in the cases where he does put his finger on the Bad Guys \u2026 they have a terrible tendency to get away. Of course, in those cases the finger of justice smooshes them like bugs \u2013 their ships sink or they otherwise pay the Ultimate Penalty. All in all, though, the main reason I dislike Holmes is his treatment of Watson. Dr. John Watson is a man who served his country in war, was wounded, became a physician good enough to build a booming practice \u2026 but when he is around Sherlock Holmes he is like a bullied child anxious not to be left out. Holmes abuses him regularly. He consistently denigrates Watson's \"little pieces\", which he writes to glorify his friend (and possibly for a few extra pounds, but the only reason he ever mentions is that he wants to publicize his friend's abilities); they are ill-written, unnecessary, concentrate on all the wrong things, and really he doesn't want publicity, he works for the sake of the work. But he obviously preens himself over the praise, and it sure felt like when Watson gave up the writing Holmes was a little put out. Oh, and then of course after years of Watson saying \"Well, fine, write 'em yourself\", Holmes finally does \u2013 and spends a good deal of time saying how Watson would have done it better. (Ah, but did he ever say that to Watson? Pfft.) In several cases Holmes sends Watson off to gather information. And the good doctor works his stolid behind off trying to follow Holmes's methods and cover every base. Only for Holmes to tell him A) a blindfolded chimpanzee could have done better, but B) that's okay because Holmes did it himself anyway. In some of these situations Watson was taking time away from his wife and his medical practice to oblige his friend \u2013 because any time his friend crooked a finger said medical practice and wife dwindled in importance \u2013 and the whole time was wasting his time.The last point in this part of my rant is a large part of the \"love\" in my love-hate relationship with BBC's \"Sherlock\". Holmes disappeared two years ago, allowing the world \u2013 and Watson \u2013 to believe he was dead. And he pops up at John's side in a ridiculous disguise, and expects his old sidekick to be nothing but happy. In the tv episode, John knocks him down. And I couldn't agree more. For two years \u2013 two years \u2013 starting on that very first day the \"Reichenbach Fall\" happened \u2013 Holmes has left his best (only) friend to grieve, and grieve he does, book and tv series. On tv he sees a counselor. In the stories he just eats his heart out, replaying if-onlys. And the reason he is left in pain for two years? The same reason Holmes didn't share vital information with him other times: in the great detective's opinion Watson is not a good enough actor/liar to pull off a situation where he knows the truth. And okay, I get it: Holmes was in danger, and playing dead seems to have been necessary. But \u2013 really? \"I almost told you but I figured you'd blow it\"? I'd like to pop him in the nose myself. (\"I have given you a serious shock by my unnecessarily dramatic reappearance.\" And suddenly Sherlock Holmes morphs into Captain Obvious.)The phrase \"healthy relationship\" was not in common usage in the late 1890's and early 1900's. This relationship? Isn't healthy. (However, I begin to understand where all the 'shippers come from. \"Intimacy\" had a different tenor then, but Watson does say it an awful lot. And Holmes does seem to grab his hand, put his hands on the doctor's knees, and whisk his friend off into dark corners an awful lot. The Empty House: \"Holmes's cold, thin fingers closed round my wrist and led me forwards down a long hall \u2026 There was no lamp near and the window was thick with dust, so that we could only just discern each other's figures within. My companion put his hand upon my shoulder and his lips close to my ear.\" That's a quote that launched a thousand 'ships.)Something else that stuck with me all through the stories: all of these illustrious clients come to Holmes, requiring utmost confidentiality \u2026 with Watson sitting there to the side taking notes? Now that it's (finally) over, now that I've (finally) listened to all the stories\u2026 I feel a little like the child at the end of The Emperor's New Clothes: \"But\u2026\" Holmes isn't naked, but pretty close, and spinning some tassels and waving some feathery fans to distract the reader. And I wholeheartedly apologize for that image, especially to anyone with Jeremy Brett or Basil Rathbone as the Holmes in their head. Cumberbatch fans probably enjoy it."}, {"userName": "Sahaj", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30484141-sahaj", "userReview": "A Scandal in Bohemia: Chapter I.

Well then... Let's get to it. There are many things about Sherlock Holmes stories that I find to be brilliant but I will discuss only three in this review so as not to make it too long.The first is that Holmes is actually as brilliant as his reputation would have everyone believe. Something that I find extremely annoying in fiction is when a character has a reputation for being a fantastic investigator or for being great at something else but they never do anything to prove themselves worthy of that reputation. The character just seems to have average intelligence and the writer makes the main character look smart by making everyone else stupid. Doyle actually went to the trouble of thinking up brilliant things for Holmes to do instead of just making everyone else in the stories stupid as a lot of writers do.The second is the way Doyle handled Holmes and Watson's relationship. Something else that I have come to detest in fiction is the typical friendship in which the characters are too often making a huge sacrifice for one another and are too frequently having big emotional scenes together. Relationships such as that eventually get to the point where they seem too unrealistic and no longer make me feel anything. But Doyle manages to convince the reader that Holmes and Watson are close friends without any of the sacrifices or emotional scenes. He uses little things to show the depth of their friendship which prevents it from ever becoming sappy or too fictional. Also, the way he wrote the characters helps a great deal to establish them as being close friends. The main thing that convinced me that Holmes and Watson must care a lot for one another was the fact that Watson put up with Holmes' arrogance, rudeness, and strange behavior and the fact that Holmes, who was a very cold and unemotional person, actually allowed Watson to be his friend.The third is the stories themselves. Even today they are so original and unpredictable. Another complaint that I have about modern fiction is that I can usually determine the whole plot of the story at the very beginning or at least have a general idea where the writer is going to go with the story and the characters. With most of these stories I didn't have a clue as to what was going to happen next. There were a couple of the stories that I was able to predict but it was still cool to hear Holmes give a logical explanation as to how he had arrived at a conclusion that I had only arrived at by guessing.If you've never read these stories then I would highly recommend doing so. They are absolutely wonderful."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11121092-mark", "userReview": "I've decided that this mammoth collection of stories will be a work in progress project for me. It'll probably take me a lifetime between reading other books, but the target is set! Why am I doing this? Well, (a) you can have too much of a good thing and (b) I don't want to run the risk of the stories all rolling into one, becoming samey and then boredom setting in and the book landing on my \"given-up\" shelf. I'm quite sure that these stories were never published all in one go and in one volume. So it doesn't make sense for me to read it like one complete book either. It was probably never originally intended that way. Sir Arthur was definitely never restricted either by publishers only willing to release a certain number of books in a series, that's for sure. What I love about this book?Well, you know exactly why some authors and their works become classics and will remain forever popular. The writing just flows, it's incredibly coherent with just the right amount of suspense. I also really enjoy reading the somewhat archaic use of English. All languages develop and move along, however it is refreshing to read such works for the beauty of prose that existed at this time. Certainly don't write 'em like that anymore! Makes you aware of what has been lost in some respects. One of my favourites is the use of, \"he ejaculated\" - lol- obviously meaning \"he exclaimed.\" Depending on what was said before I still end up having schoolgirl like fits of giggles! So, please keep your eye on the progress bar and when you see it disappear onto my \"read\" shelf then I will expect a round of applause :-)"}, {"userName": "Cindy Rollins", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3480406-cindy-rollins", "userReview": "58 hours of narration by the wonderful Simon Vance which I doubt will ever be improved upon. Truly remarkable stories. I often struggle to determine how many stars to give many books, especially modern ones which often come highly touted. But there is no struggle here. These stories are superior to any modern stories I have read this year. For those who may not know this Doyle was a wonderful author of other books equal to his Sherlock Holmes books. For family reading do not miss The White Company. For manliness and chivalry do not miss Sir Gerard and Sir Nigel. This audio book was the perfect running companion. I looked forward to my runs with Sherlock very much over the last few months."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "In which we learn that Sherlock Holmes turns to a seven percent solution of cocaine for mental stimulation in the absence of a case on which to work, much to the chagrin of Dr. Watson. Arthur Conan Doyle weaves a story around the Sepoy Mutiny and a lost Indian treasure,in a plot reminiscent of Wilkie Collins' \"The Moonstone\". Sherlock Holmes reveals that he is a master of disguise and we learn more of the workings of the Baker Street Irregulars. This second appearance of Holmes and Watson is more action driven than \"A Study in Scarlet\". A very entertaining read."}, {"userName": "Megan Allison", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2192822-megan-allison", "userReview": "These novels and short stories are a blast to read when you want to get a taste of the original crime thriller stuff. It's cool to know that Doyle kind of started the detective crime mystery genre. If that doesn't make it cool enough, Sherlock Holmes makes for a very interesting character to follow, which makes sense since the character of Gregory House on the medical show HOUSE was based on Sherlock Holmes. This isn't necessarily because they both solve mysteries, but they both seem to have that irrepresible reckless to solve a puzzle and are impossibly observant and intelligent. Also, while House has his vicadin, Holmes has his occasional shot of cocaine!I also love the time period these stories take place. Late ninteenth century is like my fav! The style of talk, writing, and fads back then are always pleasant to read about. This time period also corresponds with an interesting concept of nihilism which proposes the question if men with superhuman abilities have the right to live above the moral code.Though these stories are basically identical in plot, I am entertained as much as when I first read Hound of the Baskervilles. I own a little pocket size edition of these stories and love to read these stories over again when I don't have anything else to do. I highly recommend The Sign of Four which is a bit darker and suspenseful."}, {"userName": "Joyce", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1650596-joyce", "userReview": "There are Holmes stories that I've likely read or heard a dozen times--my husband and I read the collected Sherlock Holmes stories aloud to each other when we were first married--others I had never encountered before. Or certainly don't remember. At almost 63 hours, this is a long slog, and if I appreciated Holmes more, I would have rated it higher. Certainly, it's a must for Sherlockians--and Fry is the consummate performer and a great reader."}, {"userName": "Karina Read", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33092709-karina-read", "userReview": "I LOVE Sherlock Holmes. Conan Doyle's stories are so easy to dip in and out of yet stay with you for a long time. His writing is superb and I love that while reading any one story I will be scared/nervous/curious/baffled etc.. What I particularly loved was that 80% of the time (if not more) i did not know who the culprit was. I love not knowing the ending of stories and sadly a lot of modern day crime books can be a bit predictable towards the end. Cannot recommend Sherlock Holmes high enough. Even if you don't think you'd like it, try one of his short stories. I hadn't really thought about them way back in 2009 when a colleague recommended them as 'in between revision reads' and I'm SO GLAD i picked them up."}], "description": "Ever since he made his first appearance in A Study In Scarlet, Sherlock Holmes has enthralled and delighted millions of fans throughout the world.", "title": "The Complete Sherlock Holmes\n      \n          (Sherlock Holmes #1-9)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188572.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes", "average": 4.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1512062096l/188572.jpg", "reviews": 3004, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2448.Arthur_Conan_Doyle", "name": "Arthur Conan Doyle"}], "type": ["Classics", "Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/188572.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25523721-the-complete-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7795001-the-complete-sherlock-holmes-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9637573-tutto-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/169206.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19722979-complete-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/964677.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16566323-the-complete-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27175515-the-complete-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22884833-the-complete-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/841598.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28375005-tutto-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22220878-the-complete-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5426404-the-complete-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35397257-sherlock-holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/102868.A_Study_in_Scarlet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8921.The_Hound_of_the_Baskervilles", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3590.The_Adventures_of_Sherlock_Holmes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3586.The_Complete_Sherlock_Holmes_Vol_2", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/608474.The_Sign_of_Four", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193858-the-cuckoo-s-calling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
