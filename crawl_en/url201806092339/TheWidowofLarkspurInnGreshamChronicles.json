Luckily part of her inheritance (the only thing that his creditors weren't interested in) is an old, run-down country inn. Julia and her kids pull up their roots and move out to the country, where she fixes up the inn and starts taking in lodgers. This novel is basically a pleasant and reasonably interesting tale about life in a small town in Victorian days, and the various personalities who live in and around the inn. There's also a romance, but it plays a fairly minor role in the story and it's so clean it squeaks (there probably was a chaste kiss, but it certainly wasn't memorable).This is inspirational fiction, so there's a fair amount of talk about God and faith, but I didn't consider it overly preachy. I liked this book well enough that I bought the three sequels. The first two were good (at least as good as this first book); the last one lost my interest. Periodically available for free in the Kindle version, and it's definitely worth picking up as a freebie if you enjoy inspirational historical fiction with a dash of romance."}, {"userName": "Sarah Grace", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59507807-sarah-grace", "userReview": "[The romantic interest for one character was a philanderer, although there were almost no details given.

There are loads of characters in this story, but somehow the author weaves them together beauitfully and somehow I managed to keep them all straight. I think my favorites were Mr. Clay, the Vicar, and Mrs. Howitt. The British aspect was well done, which is usually not normal for books set in England by American authors. The only term that I remember not being correct was \"candy\" instead of \"sweets.There was so many Spiritual lessons throughout this that I was amazed. The author did not shy away from the truth and I highly applaud her for weaving true, Christian faith into her story. The only thing that I didn't agree with were the couple kisses before marriage, but even those were non-detailed and sweet.This is a longer book and not fast-paced, but I definitely recommend it!"}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8586696-jamie", "userReview": "I thought I knew what I was getting into when I started Lawana Blackwell\u2019s The Widow of Larkspur, you know one main story focus, but nope!

I had seen this quite awhile ago and was instantly attracted to the cover. As I skimming through my Kindle library, searching desperately for a new book to read and this one popped up. I started in with high expectations that were not disappointed. The overall feeling to this book was warm and homey. Gresham was delightfully portrayed, I could see the very streets with a wonderful clarity as I read the book. I love it when books have strong settings, ones where you can see the story playing out in your mind. So was The Widow of Larkspur Lane. The Widow of Larkspur Lane is a great novel for single readers and families alike. I would recommend it strongly to reader who are looking for, or fine with a somewhat slower story.CharactersI really enjoyed all the characters in this book. Julia, in particular, was refreshing. In lots of books the heroines bounce from one end of the spectrum to the other. Either they are perfect or they can\u2019t boil water without messing it up. Julia was a breath of fresh air! She was totally out of her element in Gresham but that didn\u2019t stop her. She worked hard, and learned a lot. She had children to provide for and nothing was getting in her way. Julia had an air of elegance and graciousness to her that was lovely. She was very kind, very tactful, and properly discreet. I loved this character! Julia\u2019s children, Philip, Aleda, and Grace were well done.Philip tried hard to be the man about the house and was very sweet. Aleda, to be honest, wasn\u2019t really my favorite. She was rather sharp and annoying. Grace was a dear! She was so sweet definitely my favorite of the two girls. Fiona O\u2019Shea, Julia\u2019s maid/housekeeper/best friend. Fiona was so sweet. Her Irish brogue, not to mention her pluck, spiced the book up nicely. She was so dutiful and God-honoring without being annoyingly perfect. I loved her character and I was so glad she got a happy ending! There were a lot of lodgers, all of whom were unique personalities. But as there are so many I will only touch on my favorite, Mr. Clay. Ambrose Clay was such a dear man. He was always kind and considerate even through his depression. He was one of my very favorite characters. The other supporting main and side characters were good. They added to the story beautifully. My hat\u2019s off to Mrs. Blackwell! Her characters were superb. PlotThe plot of The Widow of Larkspur Inn was very enjoyable. The story was definitely a slower pace than most books I read, this wasn\u2019t bad however.One thing that was and is really annoying to me was all the desecration bordering deception Julia had about her husband's secret life. She didn't need to announce it to the world but the whole idea of 'preserving her husbands image for her kids' was stupid. Truth is best. Some of my only critiques on the story line and pace was the end. This, I felt, was not wholly satisfying. Julia\u2019s romance literally took place in like the last 3% of the book. Now to be honest, Fiona\u2019s romance was more important to me than Julia\u2019s, but I would have preferred more time with Julia\u2019s romance. I don\u2019t even think the way that her romance was laid out was bad, just too short. The ending was abbreviated in my opinion, I would have been happy for another chapter or two. Other than the above mentioned I felt that the plot and story were organized well. It flowed well and had good passage of time. The characters had time to progress in their character arcs. This book was relaxing and fun to read! Warnings:Language/Profanity: NoneViolence/Gore/Frightening Scenes: NoneSex/Nudity: There is one comment that is suggestive of immoral behavior. Not a big deal for older readers, and families could easily skip."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2411388-hannah", "userReview": "Well, this was an interesting reading experience.I started this over a week ago. It started off somewhat boring (2 stars), the middle portion was really good and engrossing (4 stars), and the end was weak, hurried, and too preachy for my own personal taste (2 stars). I do give Blackwell kudos for presenting the message of Jesus Christ in a way that made sense within the story context. However, the testimony seemed to be really heavy-handed at the very end, whereas it was sprinkled lightly throughout the first and middle portions of the book, which made it an uneven read for me.Not sure that I'll read the next two in the series, however, as this foray into inspirational literature was ok, but not totally satisfying for me. However, fans of inspirational romance would probably greatly enjoy this series, as Blackwell is a capable writer. Her characters are interesting and have hangups and problems that do not magically go away because of their faith in God, which is a good message."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5887927-sarah", "userReview": "Age Appropriate For: 15 and upBest for Ages: 15 and upDriven by dread and her desire to provide for her children, Julia decides to turn the dilapidated inn into a lodging house. But can she--who was accustomed to servants attending to every need--do what needs to be done and cope when boarders begin arriving? And then an eligible new vicar moves into town...I don\u2019t think there is a fiction book I have enjoyed as much since earlier in the year. It has also been a very long time since I have read a book for adults that wasn\u2019t centered around romance. Yes, this book has some romance, but that really isn\u2019t the focus of the book.Julia was my favorite part of the book. Her attitude in the face of hard circumstances was so different than most books. She actually had a good attitude, with some understandable moments of irritation and frustration. So many main characters of books are dramatic and have rotten attitudes and then learn their lesson. Julia had lessons to learn, but she has the attitude thing down.All the other characters were so charming that I cannot wait to see what happens to them in the next book. They were all charming, but each had their own problems. The actor who has spells of despondency (we would call him bi-polar now), the old lady that is so rude her son kicked her out, the two gossips who make lace, and the nobleman who thinks of nothing but his flowers. There are many more characters, but it was never confusing to keep up with them. They all made up a rich tapestry of characters that make up the town of Gresham.The author obviously researched the time period, including little details of daily life, making this book feel very real and believable. The descriptions made it very easy to visualize the town and places.The message of the book was not hard-hitting, but the characters\u2019 faith was unmistakable. In a very subtle yet powerful way it is shown that God does not always take away our troubles, but makes something beautiful out of them.I highly recommend this book for those who like historical fiction, stories that feel real, and are looking for a book that feels different than most Christian fiction."}, {"userName": "Staci", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11909124-staci", "userReview": "While it took a few chapters to become engaged in the story and characters, once I did, I found this novel to be charming.

This has been one of my favorite books lately. I was enjoying it so much and just getting into all the characters, thinking a plot twist was coming and it would be ending soon, when I thought to see how far along in the book I was. To my surprise, my kindle said I'd only read less than 25%. I was DELIGHTED. Usually when that happens I think to myself, \"Ugh, you mean I have to suffer with 75% more of this book?\"Character after character was introduced, but the development of each character was done so well that it wasn't overpowering. Rather it was like you were becoming familiar with friends: some you like right away, and some you have to learn a lot more about before you trust yourself to like them... Just like in our own lives.There is so much to this book to give an adequate synopsis, and I'm sure others have given decent story details to satisfy, so I won't go into it.I love when a book can tell stories about how someone grows in their own heart and we are allowed to learn from their process without the author preaching. I'm a Christian through and through, so it's not that I don't want to learn more about my faith or how God works in others lives. But far too many authors I've read lately give little thought to the actual plot, or characters, or even the reader's enjoyment. Instead they become preachers in their novel, and the art of good writing is lost. Ms. Blackwell, however, teaches plenty without losing that art. She weaves these beautiful theological, apologetical truths into the musings, the discussions and even the mishaps of nearly all the characters.Oh, not exactly a spoiler, but there is one character I learned the most from, and it wasn't the vicar. It was the actor who suffered from something akin to bipolar disorder, who, through his reasonings and impressive conclusions I learned the most.I have never read anything by this author until this book, but I fully intend to read many more after this.

Great characters, great plot, great setting.

Not really a problem wit the book, but, um, I wrote it down, so \u2026-There were a couple places where the author randomly head-hopped at the very end (about 90%+).

I was taken in by both and had reached chapter four before I was hit by the bait and switch. After a promising, if somewhat slow, start, the story suddenly reveals its true nature-Christian romance. It was an unexpected turn but I continued since I'd already invested my time and have had positive experiences with this genre in the past. That, it turned out was a mistake. I haven't the time or inclination to list all the things that I found just plain wrong with this book so I'll limit myself to the three most frustrating.The setting was England in name only. The characters, village, society and portrayal of religion was 100% American. For example the children are studying American history in school-in Victorian England-and adults are reading imported American newsletters. Other than this there was a distinctly American flavour to the story that I'm sure is only detectable to those not native to the USA. Why not just set the story where it, to all intents and purposes took place, America?The Christian element was about as subtle as a brick to the head. The reader is constantly being bludgeoned with the characters' prayers, desire to 'save' others, biblical quotes, references and such. I consider myself a regular Christian but this is the type of evangelizing that sends the less devout running for cover.Finally I might expect a common phrase of sorts to appear a couple of times but the number of times somebody comes out with \"thank you for saying that\" bordered on ridiculous.I finished this book but more because it was a train wreck I couldn't look away from than because I felt any continued interest in the story.Such high expectations, such deep disappointment."}, {"userName": "Nicole Floyd", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6031070-nicole-floyd", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. I like romance and I usually stick to the \"inspirational\" romance genre and I liked the fact that the emphasis wasn't on the romance itself, but rather who a real and solid relationship should be centered on God and mutual respect and affection. I will admit the outcome was predictable but it didn't make it any less enjoyable. I loved the characters and even though you really only got to know Phillip well and see his growth out of the three Hollis children, I still enjoyed reading about the other children and also the people in the village and the lodgers of Larkspur Inn. A very sweet book with a lovely message, especially for young ladies who may be too focused on romance and need to remember not to lose themselves in that other person and the relationship and to remember who they are and that if they have a strong relationship with God, it will help them to develop a wonderful and lasting relationship."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4075354-beth", "userReview": "This was a really sweet comfort read. The setting of the village of Gresham and the tenants of Larkspur Inn were charming, and I enjoyed their stories & interaction together. The plot moved a little slowly at times, but it had some sweet and comedic moments. I did feel like some of the ideas of faith were expressed in a way that was a bit too modern for the time period, and I was weary of the main character, Julia's, tendency to pose all of her thoughts in the form of questions. I think it was meant to be introspection, and a bit of that is great, but it became repetitive. My favorite part was the different characters, and I liked how some of them did get a happy ending, while some of them are still in progress.Recommended if you're in the mood for a gentle historical that focuses more on character interactions and vignette-type stories.

Some are quite admirable; some are less so, but all are drawn in such a way that the reader feels she has personally met them. Ms. Blackwell invites us into her characters' struggles, to root for the often timid but generous efforts of those who help them, and to draw closer to the One who holds us all in the palm of His hand.

I picked it up thinking it was a historical romance, and I liked it just fine, but Christian Romance isn't my genre.I'm not a religious person. I grew up with it, yes, but I stepped away from it quietly and with no malice years ago. This isn't a book I'd have read if I'd known it had religion as a major part of its story. Not because books with religion are bad or not worth my time, but because knowing that the romance genre is a hugely idealized version of love and relationships, I don't have a lot of interest in reading that and an idealized version of religion, where every prayer is answered and every good deed gets rewarded.I can see the appeal: All the main characters in the book are very nice, decent people, and even the bad guys aren't all bad. Widow is as much a charming period novel with some Victorian Literature influences as much as it is a Christian Romance, and I'm sure it's been greatly enjoyed by a lot of people who are fans of the subgenre. It's not the religion itself that even gets me down; it's the underlying glimpses of what felt to be a very conservative view of Christianity that got to me. While there are women holding jobs in this book, not a single one came to a non-feminine role without a man providing assistance. The widow getting the inn as a last resort was fine, but the money to open it came from a man. The town vet, a woman, only became a vet after her husband was the one to encourage her to read up on the subject. There's an underlying theme that a woman needs a man, and while I understand happy marriages are a cornerstone of religious happiness, it's the feeling that the take-home message was, \"If you're not happily married, he's either a non-religious cad, or you're not taking his direction,\" and that's not something that sits right with me.But take that with a grain of salt. I was in it for the romance, which was pretty charming, and the characters, who were also charming, and the religion was not a side dish I would have ordered, but that's me.

Not only have we distanced ourselves from God, but we've lost something of ourselves in the process. When my husband passed away, I discovered that my relationship with God had been a shallow one at best, and that I had no reservoir of inner strength to draw from.The Widow of Larkspur Inn dealt with some very difficult but moving issues (though there were also moments of fun throughout) of depression and sorrow, gambling, parenting, love and romance (in more than one age grouping), forgiveness, jealousy, and a flood of many other everyday human emotional and moral delemna's. Over and over I found myself encouraged and inspired...and highlighting in my kindle passage after passage! I struggled in putting this beautiful story down, not wanting to leave the characters for a moment and excited to see how God was working in each of their lives throughout the book. My most anticipated moment was the conversion of one very loveable character, and the author wrote the scenes of searching and questioning so beautifully and perfectly. No fussy pushing or preaching, just seeing how God moves the soul and reaches out. :)\u201cFaith would not be neccesary if if one could be sure about everything.\u201d I can't wait to continue reading through the remaining books in this series!

I just thoroughly enjoyed it. It just hits the right note, personally, in every aspect. The romances that happened throughout the 3 books in the series were subtle and did not predominately focus on physical attraction (which is sooooo often the case even in regency or period/historical books not just modern books) but more on emotional & spiritual connection. Yes, there is a spiritual aspect to the series as I believe this is usually classed as Christian Fiction. I have tried Christian Fic/Romance before even rather recently (being a religious person myself & wanting something I knew would be safe & clean) and I just usually can't stomach the heavy handed and often contrived & sometimes over the top sappy stories & spirituality (sorry, it does pain me to say it). Not so with this book! The writing of the spiritual aspects of the book were, to me, so organic and sincere to the characters and the story. Then the portrayal of depression and the other struggles the characters in the town of Gresham go through were all conveyed with accuracy and sensitivity without going to either extreme of making too light of a hard situation or obsessively & darkly dwelling on it (again this is so rare to find in a book!)

In the subsequent books I read by this author, she used a much lighter and subtler touch on the religious preaching, which gave her fine writing a chance to shine through. This is an earlier book by the Ms. Blackwell than the others I have read to date, and it's extremely preachy-full of sermonizing, evangelizing, and the like. Just the type of book that drives secular readers - like me - running for the hills.The reason I stuck with this book is because despite all the considerable proselytizing I really like Miss Blackwell's stories. She deftly handles a large cast of characters, and juggles several plot lines at once. She creates a marvelous universe - of families, villages, and the like. And her myriad and engaging characters have very individual personalities and back stories. So I just fast forwarded through the preaching (and, I have to say, there was a lot of it).I'm a totally secular reader, but I don't mind if the characters' religious faith is central to their lives. If the religious message is subtle, and handled with nuance and grace, then I'm fine with it. But I felt that I was really bludgeoned with the religious message here. So while the story telling is a solid 4 stars, I can only give the the book 3 stars because the preaching so detracted from an otherwise enjoyable story."}, {"userName": "Katherine Coble", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/295586-katherine-coble", "userReview": "I gave this my 50 page rule and then some.

But what lost me were the neighbours across the way with their idiotic \"your free house is haunted\" story, as well as the heroine's rude replies. The book's lead character often forgets to act like a real person because she's busy moralizing. I'm a devout Christian. I wish more people would take care to write better books when they choose to be a literary representation of Christianity."}, {"userName": "Kaitlin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2844007-kaitlin", "userReview": "Let me just start out by saying that I wanted to like this, I really did. It kept reading because it was a cute story that had so much potential but the more and more I read the worse it got. I liked the story and I liked the premise but I really had to work to finish this and felt like I was reading it forever. It started out at a slower pace but about half way through it started speeding up to where things were happening with no build up or development leaving me scratch my head wondering where it came from. It's kind of like the author got bored and just decided to get it over with. I liked the ensemble story line but by the end it was just a bunch of different love stories without a single one having been properly developed. Characters seem to pop up randomly with no explanation and with no purpose. A perfect example being the Squire. What the heck was he all about?! He was so pointless that it just frustrated me. I liked the characters and wanted to keep going with their story but wow that was rough."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3997297-amy", "userReview": "So really I would give this book at 2.5 star rating. It was a free download from amazon and I didn't have any other books at the time. It took me a while to finish it because it just dragged but I still wanted to see how some characters' issues were resolved. I will occasionally read a \"christian\" novel because I can count on them to be clean reads but, even though I am Christian, I don't like to talk about Jesus and being converted on every other page, it's just not why I read novels. This book was definitely Christian overload for me. And lastly, unfortunately the romance was sooooo not there for me (so disappointing!). It was such a lame romance that I kept hoping some other man would appear on the scene, but no. All I can say I liked of this book was the time period, and a few other spunky characters side stories."}, {"userName": "Maddy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6411553-maddy", "userReview": "Obviously Blackwell did her research for this book, and came up with an excellent idea. So why 2 stars than?This book was too...british. It meanders with no real idea of where the plot is going. At first I thought the majority of the book would be about moving to Larkspur Inn, but that was resolved by page 40 or so. Than they are all accepted by the town fairly quickly, another dodge for any complications in the book. Than by page 200 we are introduced to a completely new character who seems will play a vital role in the story, after its about half way thru! Although the book reads well, and again, she did her research. The author didn't set up any kind of lasting problem/drama/action that must be resolved. So I felt I could ultimately put the book down at any point and feel satisfied. Not to mention I was a little put off by all the heavy handed messages about God."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22090735-christy", "userReview": "Splendid, just splendid. What a wonderful light but thoroughly enjoyable read. Between Julia and the many guests at Larkspur Inn and the many faces of Gresham coating the pages with warmth and light humor this will certainly be a favorite of mine. There were so many characters to this book and I loved it. There was always something new going on with the guests and friends in town. It moved along quite nicely and I'll have to say I was pleased with every aspect of this book and It's many details of whimsy. I will certainly embark on a quest to find number two in this book The Courtship of the Vicar's Daughter. This book welcomed you in this quaint village town and I was dreadful at the end when I had to leave."}, {"userName": "Book Him Danno", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/872245-book-him-danno", "userReview": "A delightful regency story that does not involve passionate sex and despicable family members. It was well written and left one feeling that they really knew the characters. It tells the story of a young widow who is forced by her deceased husbands gambling debts to have to leave London and try to provide for her three children and one maid who insists of going with her. It left me looking forward to reading the next book in the series. It takes place in a beautiful part of England and describes a life style as it used to be. It turns out to be a love story with meaning and makes one feel good. I gave it a 4 star rating.

His debts strip away his family\u2019s very way of life, leaving Julia and her children with no other provision than The Larkspur, a dilapidated, one-time coaching in located in the country village of Gresham. Left with no other recourse than to reinvent herself, Julia pins her family\u2019s hopes of survival on the inn, and with the aid of Fiona, a servant and friend who fled from Ireland years earlier, she determines to reopen the Larkspur as a lodging house. Life in Gresham is a far cry from the cosmopolitan lifestyle Julia and her little family once enjoyed, but with no other choice, Julia determines to lead the household into a brighter future as the Larkspur\u2019s mistress. Country superstitions and the eccentricities of lodgers challenge each individual who comes to call the Larkspur home, and for the first time without the guidance of a man as head of household, Julia and Fiona are forced to rely on their faith and latent talents like never before, blossoming into capable businesswomen. But the faith to love again may be their greatest challenge yet\u2026Lawana Blackwell has long been a favorite novelist, one I credit with contributing to the expansion of Christian fiction in the late 90s beyond the long-established norm of prairie romances. The Gresham Chronicles is a series I revisited often following its initial publication, but in recent years the idea of re-reading even cherished favorites has seemed like too daunting a prospect, too time consuming when one considers the ever growing list of newly released novels to read. There is also the fear that upon revisiting a book that has defined and shaped one\u2019s reading identity even in some small way may result in disappointment \u2013 with growth and changing taste, will a once-loved classic hold up years later?If nothing else, revisiting The Widow of Larkspur Inn for the first time in at least ten years has cemented my resolve to make time to reacquaint myself with old favorites, for I was most happy to discover that Blackwell\u2019s writing not only holds up but still shines. Her ability to transport the reader into her setting is one of the best in the business, her world-building saturated with the sights, sounds, and feel of Victorian England to the smallest detail.Since this book first released, Elizabeth Gaskell\u2019s fiction has enjoyed a renewal in popularity and awareness, thanks in large part to the success of lavish costume dramas like Cranford and North and South. Those who enjoy Gaskell\u2019s stories in print and film will find much to love in the pages of Blackwell\u2019s writing, as like her predecessor she is most at home penning stories of community and change, varied social vignettes skillfully strung together and painted against a social backdrop ripe for the advances of the Victorian era.From her principle players to supporting roles, Blackwell is positively fastidious in crafting nuanced, colorful characters that populate each social strata of Gresham. Far from just Julia\u2019s story, this is a fully-realized tale of her world, from her children\u2019s growing pains to her deepening friendship with Fiona to the quirky, lace-making neighbors the Worthy sisters, an argument could be made that Blackwell\u2019s thorough characterizations are Dickensian in scope and detail.I love Julia\u2019s character arc. She is a woman wholly of her time, but through her faith and experiences grows into a woman more capable and empowered than her previously occupied social role ever allowed her to dream possible. Romance plays a role, yes, but only insomuch as it supplements Julia\u2019s newfound maturity and confidence. Here Blackwell gives readers the story of a woman first and foremost coming into her own, where faith and personal growth are the endgame and romance is a delicious bonus.This novel contains one of my favorite sub-plots by far in all my years of reading inspirational fiction, that of the slow-burning relationship between Fiona and lodger Ambrose Clay, the melancholic actor who comes to Gresham to retreat from life only to find himself inextricably drawn into the lives of his fellow residents. Ambrose is a brooding, Byronic hero \u2013 an Edward Rochester type with an extra measure of self-loathing and a dash of redemptive compassion and humor. Their greatest obstacle to happiness isn\u2019t Ambrose\u2019s moods but rather Fiona\u2019s secret shrouded past, and their journey to happiness is an angst-ridden romance lover\u2019s dream.Faith saturates these pages but not overly so, as Blackwell weaves faith into the very fabric of her characters\u2019 lives, as much as part of them as breathing. Julia\u2019s growth is inextricably entwined with her exploration of faith, as she claims both her belief in God and her belief in herself for herself, not to be taken for granted or assumed as an extension of her social role. And Vicar Phelps\u2019s efforts to lead Ambrose to Christ remains one of my favorite \u201cconversion\u201d experiences in inspirational fiction, for rather than preaching, he befriends and engages, living the tenets of his faith in such a way that Ambrose experiences that fruit without the pressure of expectation. And upon this reading, I was once again struck by Blackwell\u2019s sensitivity in handling the issue of depression, faith, and the hope of healing. Belief is not a quick fix or \u201cmagic\u201d cure, and while healing and restoration is never to be discounted or dismissed, with Ambrose, Blackwell beautifully illustrates the blessing of faith in facing life\u2019s trials.The Widow of Larkspur Inn is a modern inspirational classic, one I\u2019m thrilled to have finally revisited after years of fond memory. Blackwell\u2019s fiction is a warm, enveloping, beautifully realized world. She excels at exploring the minutiae of Victorian life with warmth and humor, sketching nostalgic vignettes that bring Victorian England to life on the page. Revisiting Gresham has reminded me anew that Blackwell\u2019s deftly drawn characters, deliciously slow-burning romance, and refreshingly honest spirituality \u2013 particularly for the time period \u2013 sets a high standard today. I look forward to revisiting Gresham again soon \u2013 for stories like this never lose their shine."}], "description": "When Life Seemed Its Worst, Gresham AwaitedJulia Hollis' opulent life in Victorian London crashes to pieces when her husband passes away.
