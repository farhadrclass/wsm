No seriously. I can't read a chapter in this book without thinking of Civ. games I have played. If you love Civ. you will love this book.On a more serious note, I am very pleased with this book so far. While the general idea that the political situation of different areas is dependent on the cultural/political history of those areas seems pretty obvious, Fukuyama provides a wealth of information about different cultures that clearly illustrate his points.I find the style to be \"easy academic\". It is not as easy to read as a David McCullough book but is not like reading true theory or a complex political science monograph. He even has some sarcastic comments. (Like all serious Libertarians should move to sub-Saharan Africa to truly experience what it is like to live in a place with a weak state.) What I find to be the most valuable are the histories of the different peoples (China, India, Islamic etc.). I really enjoy the broad sweep he provides working from the first bands of migrants up through the late middle ages with some extensions into later periods. It is always impressive that even the earliest events have impact on much later parts of political development. (Such as the development of strong religion before statehood in India v. the development of a strong state before religion in China.)***After finishing the book all I said before is true. The latter part of the book focuses more on European states from the middle ages to the French Revolution. Fukuyama provides the same sweeping review of their histories as he did for the earlier examples and they are just as compelling. If I had one take away thought it would be \"Thank God for England\".I am excited about the next volume of this work which will focus on state development after the French Revolution. I am eager to read his thoughts on \"state building\" projects and anticipate a discussion of how autocratic states like China have a leg up in the modern world and to learn what he believes modern democracies can do to catch up."}, {"userName": "Hadrian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian", "userReview": "Francis Fukuyama, unfortunately, is still widely known for his mistakes - and they are big ones - proclaiming the 'end of history' of the 1990s, and his influence in Neoconservatism and the disastrous military adventures of imperialism which resulted from it.Fortunately for all, he has drifted away from that, and has now released a timely and remarkably observant book about the history and formation of states and political entities, in this particularly uncertain political climate. Political entities are inherently conservative, resisting progress. We're not as far gone as pre-Revolutionary France, but unless certain extreme anti-statist trends are stopped, the United States could slide further and faster from its position at the top.He covers a broad sweep of history, starting from our distant hominid ancestors and working his way up through ancient China, India, the Middle East, and Europe, comparing and contrasting various trends the whole way. The narrative is thick with historical facts, covering much, and still managing to be very clear.Furthermore, he states that political order/government is a necessary component of our lives, and that many are only too ignorant of the benefits of it. For an example of libertarian ideas in action, one only need to look at sub-Saharan Africa for that unparalleled success.A very interesting book - but one that lacks some analysis of more modern eras, particularly of more authoritarian states and a comparison to liberal democracies. That is most likely left to the second volume, which I am waiting for eagerly."}, {"userName": "Szplug", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1843184-szplug", "userReview": "Well-written, expertly-researched, and thoroughly establishing an evidentiary framework for the analysis Fukuyama brings to his politico-historical game: the permutations of state-building and infrastructure, rule of law, and governmental accountability that have accompanied the evolutionary pathway\u2014fraught with periodic episodes of regression and decay\u2014towards the modern era of various democratic state structures in the face of an inherent familialism\u2014the latter the tendency, via segmentary lineages, for a Patrimonial constitutive political character which treats of the state as part of one's extended family, and all of the nepotistic and kin-aggrandizing actions that accompany it.

I've a bad case of the blahs at the moment, and doubtless, once they've passed, the excellence of Fukuyama's latest will make itself more readily apparent (and earn a better review than this bit of pissy rain-induced quibble); for this is, in the end, one exceedingly excellent book."}, {"userName": "Roslyn Ross", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3745545-roslyn-ross", "userReview": "The whole premise of the book is based on humans having a natural need for status. That is why politics supposedly exists. But is status really a need? I know status can help us get some of our needs met, our needs for respect, appreciation, feeling valued, feeling seen, finding a mate, but status itself as a NEED? I don't see status as the motivating factor for the actions of most of the high status people I know.I do see status as a motivating factor for people with low self-esteem, along the lines of: \"If only I were important enough, then I would like myself!\" Unfortunately, these status-seekers rarely obtain high status and if they do, they are destructive with it. Those who experience status as a \"need\" are NOT (generally) the world influencers.When I want higher status in a situation, it is because I want to get sh** done as quickly and efficiently as possible and hierarchy (status) helps that happen. It's not because I am pining after fame or glory or stepping on little people, but because I enjoy the sheer act of getting sh** done. I think most world influencers are this way. And there are many situations when an entire group of people recognizes this and trusts in a leader to tell them what to do (picture building a castle or fighting in a war). These people who can recognize good leadership when they see it, create civilizations that get more sh** done and end up being more fit to survive.My point is: Status is a two-way street. When it's not, either the leader or the led get killed.My disagreements with his views on status aside, I really appreciate how clear Fukuyama is that government is the organized use of force/violence/coercion. I enjoyed the history he presented. That is why this book gets two stars instead of one.It doesn't get more stars than that because I have read a lot about hunter-gatherers and vikings and his accounts of both of these groups do not match with the other things I have read about them. This makes me wonder how accurate the rest of the history he presents is.The thing I dislike about this book the most is the misleading title. What I am really curious about is how egalitarian hunter-gatherers first came into agreement that rulers were a good idea. I am interested in that process, however it happened and however long it took, of the invention of hierarchy. That is, I am interested in the actual ORIGINS of political order, of status. This book contributed very little to my ability to answer that question. In the final chapters Fukuyama discusses the human nature of \"reciprocal altruism\" and \"kin selection,\" but I have read articles on hunter-gatherer anthropology in which these ideas are hotly debated. I am more convinced that neither exist, that they are shoddy attempts of Westerners to understand hunter-gatherers, than that they are a reflection of the real \"rules of human nature.\"Soooo... this book should be titled The DEVELOPMENT of Political Orders Around the World and the author should really look more into human nature before he continues theorizing. Note: Later I did find the book I had been looking for about the actual origins of organized coercion and, for those who are interested, Lifeways of Hunter Gatherers: The Foraging Spectrum.

I am in excited anticipation of the second volume, which has just recently been released. In the context of modern writers, Fukuyama is connecting the dots between Jared Diamond's works on prehistoric social development and Neil Furgusan's work on the ascendance of western society post middle ages. Fukuyama provides a comprehensive account of the emergence of social order, beginning with our ape relatives, moving through prehistoric man proceeding to the emergence of more comtemporary forms of social order, up until the eve of French Revolution and the industrial age. Fukuyama gives the most complete account of the emergence of tribal organization from clan organization, including the critical importance of early religious ideas (i.e. ancestor worship) in this process. He details the importance of biological factors underlying social relatedness, debunking Hobbes AND Rousseau and he concludes with strong evidence based arguments that social order preexists the evolution of man entirely.Fukuyama goes on to posit the basic underpinnings of modern social institutions. He surveys the three pillars of a stable state: 1) a strong centralized state that overcomes tribal patrimonialism, 2) the rule of law, often beginning with a religious class that constrains the actions of state leaders and 3) political accountability that involves a cohesive civil society that demands accountability from it's leaders.Fukuyama takes us through a fascinating account of the emergence of the state in China, India, the Muslim World and Europe using these as examples that illustrate the commonalities and differences in state formation from tribal level society. I found Fukuyama's account of each of these instances to be deeply insightful and illuminating. From the Chin dynasty's invention of the state burocracy in the face of chronic war and widespread early literacy and Confucian philosophy to the Indian Caste and Jati system to the Muslim world's military slavery system of Mamelukes and Janissaries and finally to the European Catholic invention of celibate religious castes and cannon law, it seems that amazing cultural ingenuity was necessary to overcome the constraints of tribalism in moving to the modern state. Often this ingenuity came at a breathtaking cost of coercion and lost liberty, but this is the legacy we have inherited with the amazing power and potential of our modern state. The modern world, in all its diversity, suddenly makes so much more sense after reading volume one of this two volume tour de force. I can hardly wait to start on volume 2. It is loaded and ready to go on my ipod as I type this!"}, {"userName": "Atila Iamarino", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5648532-atila-iamarino", "userReview": "Uma vers\u00e3o mais longa, detalhada e cheia de exemplos hist\u00f3ricos do que o Porque Falham as Na\u00e7\u00f5es explica.

This book carries Fukuyama\u2019s analysis up to the French Revolution; a second volume carries the story to the modern day. This volume is mostly taken up with creating and discussing a coherent framework that explains political order before the modern era. Much of what Fukuyama discusses here is non-Western societies, which makes it particularly interesting.The reason for the time break at the French Revolution is basically the Malthusian Trap. Before the West created societies in which productivity gains were so great that actual per capita income consistently rose, most of the world\u2019s political orders were based on zero-sum games, where dividing the pie in your favor was the only road to wealth. This obviously has important implications for any political order (including that property rights create different incentives in a Malthusian world) and creates what appears to be a natural division (though, given that most of the non-Western world has not escaped the Malthusian Trap, it may not be a sensible division\u2014I\u2019ll have to see what the second volume says).In any case, Fukuyama divides this book into four main sections: Before The State; State Building; The Rule Of Law; and Accountable Government. This is in keeping with Fukuyama\u2019s core thesis, which is that a modern optimal state, by which he means a liberal democracy, must contain three key characteristics. These are (a) a state, by which he means an effective central government; (b) the rule of law; and (c) accountability of the state to all its constituents. Most of this book is a detailed exploration of each of these characteristics and how they developed, or failed to develop, in the context of different historical global political orders. Counterpoised to all three characteristics is the strong human tendency towards patrimonialism\u2014having as one\u2019s main goal rewarding family and friends. Fukuyama\u2019s explicit exemplar of a \u201cmodern optimal state\u201d is Denmark; he repeatedly refers to the goal being \u201cgetting to Denmark,\u201d \u201cknown to have good political and economic institutions: it is stable, democratic, peaceful, prosperous, inclusive, and has extremely low levels of political corruption.\u201dFukuyama begins his section \u201cBefore The State\u201d with a review of how there are a lot of defective political orders today, even though towards the end of the 20th Century it seemed that liberal democracy was sweeping the world. He notes, as he does throughout the book, that there is no iron law of forward progress. Moreover, he makes clear up front that he is not a fan of the Nozickian state\u2014as a core premise, he posits as essential a \u201cstrong, hierarchical government\u201d resting on \u201ca hidden institutional foundation of property rights, rule of law, and basic political order.\u201dFukuyama therefore rejects the Nozickian libertarian state. A Nozickian would claim that the Nozickian state is actually the essence of things Fukuyama cites as essential, and any more extensive state is unnecessary to accomplish those things. Fukuyama would respond (and does, as discussed below) that the state must itself have a certain degree of strength beyond securing those essential things, primarily in order to prevent erosion of central power and the creation thereby of weakness attractive to outside enemies. More generally, though, Fukuyama does not fear Leviathan as long as it is bound by the rule of law and accountable; he apparently sees no inherent virtue in smaller and less intrusive government.In this first section, occasionally Fukuyama stumbles, as when he quotes Amartya Sen to the effect that democracy is the \u201cdefault political condition\u201d and nowadays \u201ctaken to be generally right,\u201d and then noting that \u201cvery few people around the world openly profess to admire Vladimir Putin\u2019s petronationalism, or Hugo Chavez\u2019s \u2018twenty-first-century socialism,\u201d or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s Islamic republic.\u201d This was not true even when the book was written in 2011. Mainstream left-wingers around the world, including the entire American left, openly and effusively praised Chavez during his entire career, writing glowing articles about his supposed success (yet another tedious example of the search for a supposed Third Way). Even now, as Venezuela collapses completely into ruin, most liberals, as usual, do not ascribe the gruesome failure to Chavez or to authoritarian socialism generally And since 2011, the number of people around the world openly admiring Putin has grown by leaps and bounds, and even Iran has been embraced by the community of nations, though neither nation has moved any closer to democracy. This, and most of Fukuyama\u2019s few other analytical stumbles, seem to relate to a combination of his optimism and belief that, despite the many bad people out there, that most people are good and ultimately striving to \u201cget to Denmark.\u201d That\u2019s probably not a safe assumption. Maybe they\u2019re instead striving to get to Denmark\u2019s valuables, like the migrants who flooded into Europe beginning in the summer of 2015.Anyway, Fukuyama notes that the idea that humans voluntarily formed political orders out of some pre-social existence, whether according to the system of Locke, Hobbes, Rousseau or Paine, is silly. There was never some pre-social state of nature. Chimpanzees have a political order, and we adopted it. Band-level human organization is essentially the same as chimpanzee organization; it revolves around being tied to and favoring family and friends\u2014patrimonialism.. Humans made such organization more complex and found ways to increase social cohesion, but it\u2019s basically the same ways chimps act. Here Fukuyama also introduces another major theme of his book, which is that humans are driven by much more than economics\u2014like chimps, they are driven as much, or more, by other drives, such as the desire to benefit kin, and the desire for status and recognition independent of economic benefits.Fukuyama explains how all primitive societies have characteristics in common, one major one being the \u201ctyranny of cousins\u201d\u2014family obligations are everything, and band-level societies are largely egalitarian, reducing the incentives for any one person to create additional value. At the same time, in primitive societies having large amounts of property held in common actually does not lead to the \u201ctragedy of the commons,\u201d and in fact works fairly well. Western-style property rights are not critical to functioning at this level. (Fukuyama also notes in passing that there is zero evidence any matriarchal society has ever existed, myths to the contrary notwithstanding.) He explains how \u201csegmentary\u201d band-level societies may fight with each other, but combine to fight outsiders. (To use an example Fukuyama does not use, the Hatfields and McCoys fought each other, but would likely have fought together against outsiders, or Yankees.)Humans then created tribal-level societies\u2014essentially bands forming together on the basis of descent from an (often fictive) common ancestor, usually with a chief having very limited powers at their head. Such tribes were capable of greater organization, greater warfare, and greater productivity. But the need to reward relatives, followers and clients was still the key\u2014until the early Roman Empire, in fact, tribalism was in many ways the basic organizing principle of Rome, and is still very important in most of the world, including modern India and China. In such societies, there was neither a state, nor rule of law, nor accountability.Next came state-level societies (chiefdoms, followed later by true states), distinguished from tribes by having centralized authority with a monopoly on legitimate coercion, and by being based on territory, not kinship status. Fukuyama rejects various theories of how this happened, from it being a voluntary compact to being necessary to create irrigation to merely having a dense enough population. His favored explanation is that once there is adequate wealth, population density and status differentiation, thereafter when there is organized violence arising from other people, particularly states, those not organized as states have a strong incentive to so organize, because it makes warfare much more effective. This effect is increased when geography makes movement away from conflict difficult or impossible, and by religious beliefs that also tend to legitimize central authority (e.g., Islam). He also notes that even so, in most modern states, tribalism lies just under the surface, and \u201ccomplex kinship structures remain the primary locus of social life.\u201d And so the human desire to reward kin and friends, patrimonialism, is always pulling in the opposite direction, very strongly in all societies, except in Europe, where Christianity early \u201cundermined kinship as a basis for social cohesion.\u201dFukuyama says that we don\u2019t have to guess whether this is all true. We can prove it, using China as the exemplar. China was the first modern state, and much of its history is extremely well documented. So China is what Fukuyama turns to when starting his next major section, \u201cState Building.\u201dFukuyama defines a state as \u201can organization deploying a legitimate monopoly of violence over a defined territory\u201d, which is \u201csubject to a rational division of labor, based on technical specialization and expertise, and impersonal both with regard to recruitment and their authority over citizens.\u201d Here, Fukuyama begins with discussing Chinese tribalism and the importance of family and kinship to all past and present Chinese social institutions, including agnatic (male-line) descent and its implications for inheritance and other social structures. (In several places in the book Fukuyama notes that traditionally a Chinese person\u2019s obligations to his parents are greater than those to his children, a highly alien concept in the West.) China\u2019s first proto-state was the Zhou \u201cfeudalism\u201d around 1200 B.C., which was still largely a grouping not of lords under a ruler, but of lords and their kinship groups under a weak central state. But Fukuyama\u2019s thesis is that what drove China to a true state structure, first under the Qin, was incessant warfare, leading to vastly greater mobilization of men for war than in ancient Rome or Greece. States were able to organize an efficient military; tax to fund that military; maintain a bureaucracy to organize that military; and administer that military over time and space. Fukuyama emphasizes that while China created the first modern state, it totally lacked, at all times and places, both the rule of law and accountability, and thus was and is far from the \u201coptimal state.\u201d One particularly interesting (and lengthy) discussion here is the conflict in China between the ideas of Legalism and Confucianism. We think of Chinese moral thought, which is the only brake on the state given the Chinese lack of rule of law, as essentially equivalent to Confucianism, with its emphasis on a perfect past that must be emulated and resulting moral (but only moral) limits on societies and especially rulers. But during earlier periods, including the Qin, Legalism held sway, which was basically a positivist theory not dissimilar to modern leftist thought (and, as Fukuyama points out, to Chinese Communist thought). \u201cThe Legalists proposed to treat subjects not as moral beings to be cultivated through education and learning but as Homo economicus, self-interested individuals who would respond to positive and negative incentives\u2014particularly punishments. The Legalist state therefore sought to undermine tradition, break the bonds of family moral obligations, and rebind citizens to the state on a new basis.\u201d This means not even a moral brake on the power of the state. But ultimately Confucianism was restored to primacy, until Communism, such that at least a moral brake existed on the power of the state.In the many hundreds of years of various Chinese states, the pendulum swung back and forth between central states, of varying strengths, and reversions to tribal-type patrimonialism. The reversions weren\u2019t to true tribal-type patrimonialism, though. All actors aspired to re-create a central state\u2014but many merely wanted that as a device to extend patrimonialism. They didn\u2019t want to build up local power groups based on kin but rather to insert their kin into a reconstituted central government, which would act as a front for patrimonialist distribution of goods and power. Needless to say, this is not what Fukuyama considers an optimal political order.Fukuyama then spends a great deal of time on comparative Indian history. All of it is fascinating. His ultimate conclusion is that India ended up the opposite of China\u2014it never had a strong central state, nor aspired to it, largely because India always had very strong social groups, largely originating in and reinforced by the religious norms of Hinduism. Strong non-state social bonds and rules prevented strong state formation. In fact, India initially started down the same path of China of state formation, but detoured when Hinduism became the dominant religion. (In many ways, Fukuyama\u2019s analysis of strong social connections preventing strong state control is reminiscent of Robert Nisbet\u2019s theses in \u201cThe Quest For Community.\u201d) In the context of state development, as well as more generally, Fukuyama is highly critical of those who see religion as merely a screen for other motivations, such as economic drivers, noting that \u201csuch explanations fail to penetrate the subjectively experienced coherence of the society and reflect nothing more than the secular biases of the observers themselves.\u201d Fukuyama sees religion as both a key motivator of human actions, and very often a key component of most of the steps in the creation of states.The third group analyzed for its state-like characteristics is the Islamic caliphate and its offshoots, including the Mamluk sultanate. Here Fukuyama emphasizes the well-known role of Islamic military slavery, whether Mamluk or Ottoman, in preventing backsliding into patrimonialism and therefore supporting a strong central state. And, of course, as those slave systems eroded, patrimonialism (a key component of human nature) returned, and the states lost power.Finally, Fukuyama discusses how Europe was able to form states more effectively than anywhere else in the world, because the medieval Roman church undermined kinship groups, by providing both a separate power source and by encouraging legal structures that permitted property donation to the Church, thus reducing family legacy power. (He notes how, again contrary to myth, in England from an early time women could hold and sell property outside the family, as well as sue and be sued, and make wills and contracts without the permission of a male guardian.) Fukuyama posits that European feudalism, which was uniquely not kin-based and allowed smooth power and economic relations among non-related individuals, was an alternative to kinship-based systems. European feudalism was necessary to organize defenses to warfare when kinship systems had been eroded, but its creation smoothed the way to the formation of modern states, since it prevented patrimonialism.The third major section of the book is \u201cRule Of Law.\u201d Fukuyama defines this, commonly enough, as where \u201cthe preexisting body of law is sovereign over legislation,\u201d whatever the source of that preexisting body of law. Here, most of the discussion centers around Europe, where the rule of law emerged early and which is the only set of societies that has consistently maintained the rule of law. (Fukuyama never makes it explicit, at least in this volume, but really only European societies have ever met his definition of optimal societies.) But rule of law is not, for Fukuyama, basically the same as property rights, as many libertarians would have it. He points out that, as in China, you can have \u201cgood enough\u201d property rights and contract enforcement to permit economic growth, while still totally lacking the rule of law. In Fukuyama\u2019s vision, the rule of law permeates all relations between the state and members of its constituent groups.The start of Fukuyama\u2019s analysis centers around England. He locates the origin of European rule of law in relatively strong central government in England, which led to the Common Law being centrally administered, eroding the ability of local elites to avoid the rule of law to benefit themselves. The king\u2019s willingness to enforce the law against the such elites (combined with other features of England, like less separation between local elites and local non-elites than found elsewhere) allowed the law to be seen, countrywide, as impartial and beneficial to all. This reinforced the legitimacy of the English state, creating first in England the two legs of the tripod Fukuyama views as the essence of modern optimal government.Outside England, though, it was the role of Catholic Church in promulgating a reinvigorated civil law based on Roman law that created a broader rule of law (although the Church also contributed to the English rule of law). After the investiture controversy between Gregory VII and Henry IV, the Church was firmly established as an independent player in European law, and was itself in many ways a modern state, a \u201cmodern, hierarchical, bureaucratic, and law-governed institution,\u201d that had eliminated patrimonialism by mandating clerical celibacy. The Church used its authority to promulgate canon law, based on Roman law and made coherent by Gratian, thus \u201caccustom[ing] rulers to the idea that they were not the ultimate source of the law.\u201d And the separation of church and state also allowed room for the modern secular state, as opposed to a caeasaropapist state like Byzantium or Islam, to emerge. Fukuyama repeatedly rejects the Marxist and Weberian view of the Reformation as the key element in the creation of modern Europe as ahistorical. Instead, he points to the early exit out of kinship patrimonialism and the creation of a modern legal order, both caused solely by the Catholic Church in the early Middle Ages. Outside Europe, Islam and India also had a form of the rule of law, though not to the degree of Europe. China never did, and does not to this day. Fukuyama emphasizes that contrary to common belief, medieval Islam was not theocratic, where religious leaders rule the state. Instead, it was caeasaropapist, where secular rulers dominate religion. This meant that in theory at least Muslim secular rulers recognized separate divine authority, which resulted in a species of the rule of law. However, the lack of any organized central religious authority in practice allowed secular rulers to never have to actually do anything they didn\u2019t want to do. In an interesting aside, Fukuyama cites Noah Feldman to the effect that a significant driver of modern Islamism is the desire to leave the \u201clawless authoritarianism of contemporary regimes.\u201d In this analysis, the demand for sharia law is not a theocratic reaction, but a demand for a more balanced regime featuring the rule of law. In other words, more religion, less tyranny. I find this compelling, though by no means the entire explanation, since there have been plenty of demands for pure theocracy in Muslim history, such as the Kharijites.[There's more, but Goodreads won't let me post a review longer than this--so if you care, and you're still reading, you can go see the rest at my Amazon review."}, {"userName": "Gwern", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11004626-gwern", "userReview": "It is, overall, an excellent book and one of the better ones on grand history I've read\u2020... but Fukuyama does not have a very transparent prose style, and makes no concessions to those who don't have a good grasp on global history and especially those who don't know their Chinese history well (eg. if you can't put the Qing, Han, Qin, and Shang dynasty in order, you aren't going to enjoy at all the large amounts of material he rightfully devotes to Chinese politics).

This writing was influenced by the conservative Chicago philosopher, Allan Bloom who has despised the intellectual relativism growing in the American politics since then. Fukuyama feared, quite rightfully, that after the collapse of the Soviet Union, American politics will only be focused on the mundane issues of administration rather than following larger-than-life ideological battles.Fukuyama worked with Rand Corporation, the military focused think tank, during the 1980s. His assignment was to devise a strategy to counter the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. It started Fukuyama\u2019s brief interlude with the ISI that culminated in devising the policy for fighting Soviet army in Afghanistan with American dollars and Pakistani strategic help to Afghan Mujahideen. He has also had political associations with the neoconservative movement. He signed a letter after the September 11 attacks urging President Bush to overthrow Saddam Hussein. But by 2006, he accepted his miscalculation and has been criticising the neoconservatives and invasion of Iraq since then. \u201cAll of the Kissinger-era realists have gone away. Today, the party is just a wasteland\u201d, he says about present day Republicans.The Origins of Political Order: From Prehuman Times to the French Revolution is a dedication to Samuel Huntington, the man best known for his Clash of Civilizations thesis. Fukuyama states in the preface that his new book is inspired from Huntington\u2019s Political Order in Changing Societies and that he seeks to find how the political order originated in the first place, factors contributing to it and why some societies still have not been able to achieve it.Those who have some interest in political theory dealing with the questions of the origin and development of political institutions might think that so much has been contemplated and put to writing by classical and modern political philosophers on the subject that there is really no need to ramble on these speculative questions anymore. We find varying and sometimes contradictory stances in the views of Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, and so many others. However Fukuyama, living in the 21st century, has one advantage over these classical theorists and that is the vast knowledge base produced by anthropology, archeology, etcetera, to which he has access.This book is based on certain assumptions; there is a universal human nature exhibiting certain behaviours like favouring relatives, reciprocal altruism, establishing rules, and competing for self-interest. These behaviours, according to Fukuyama, have given rise to certain political practices that can be seen throughout history. During nomadic times of hunter-gatherer societies, people formed kinship groups and their lives were tightly knit along kinship lines. This was the first kind of social, political and economic association. In Fukuyama\u2019s words, kinship association generated \u201ctyranny of cousins\u201d. The only way out of it was the next step along political evolution, the creation of states. But, even the formation of state could not completely solve the problem of kinship and the kind of favouritism it breeds. It only shifted it up the chain. Now there were powerful rulers extending favors to their relatives. This phenomenon is present in today\u2019s world, more visibly in the Middle East monarchies.To address this intrinsic problem of human nature, the concepts of accountability and rule of law were introduced. Fukuyama is of the opinion that history of political developments juggles between power grabbing centralising forces and rights disseminating decentralising forces. Every society needs a balance between these two forces to establish political order otherwise anarchy and chaos prevails.A strong centralised state was established in ancient China which prevailed over tribalism by the Qin Dynasty by developing an official class loyal to the state rather than to family. But this society lacked accountability and became too centrally strong which proved to be fatal for its further development.Walking forward through the millennia Fukuyama investigates the political evolution of the Islamic caliphate: \u201cThere is no clearer illustration of the importance of ideas to politics than the emergence of an Arab state under the Prophet Muhammad\u201d. Muslim emperors devised the institutions of slave-armies which had no family ties; their sole purpose was to serve the state.Then Fukuyama gives an example of 13th century Hungary arriving at its own Magna Carta (\u201cthe golden bull\u201d) and transferring powers to nobles from the monarch. But Hungary could not evolve a stable constitutional government like Britain because the king was extremely weakened and there was no force to unify the rebellious nobles exploiting their peasants. Nobles were also too powerful in France which resulted in disenchantment of masses with the existing political structure and their discontent was expressed through the French Revolution.Fukuyama also analyses why the poorer societies cannot easily develop effective states. Just as institutions are too complicated to be changed easily, so too they are hard to develop, he professes. \u201cPoor countries are poor not because they lack resources,\u201d he writes, \u201cbut because they lack effective political institutions.\u201d Where there is no rule of law, there cannot be effective political and economic development. This line of thought, however, puts Fukuyama at odds with the Marxist theorists who base all social and political development on economic resources.Fukuyama is mainly interested in civilizations and how societies achieve political order. As opposed to Jared Diamond\u2019s Guns, Germs, and Steel, which focuses largely on material and geographical causes, Fukuyama analyses behavioural and cultural values in order to answer the question of political evolution. The Origins of Political Order is volume one of a two-volume work, and Fukuyama intends to take the discussion up to the contemporary times (this one ends with the French revolution) with the second volume. Notably, in recent talks, Fukuyama stays loyal to his earlier thesis and stresses that the modern liberal state is still in his view the end of history.Published: http://beta.dawn.com/news/708856/non-..."}, {"userName": "Paul Crider", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/533069-paul-crider", "userReview": "This book impressed me. Fukuyama is humble enough to recognize that his topic is far too complex and multicausal to allow for anything like a predictive theory. Instead, he describes the historical details associated with the development of his three ingredients of political order in representative societies. These ingredients are a strong state, the rule of law, and political accountability. Fukuyama frequently references his explanatory \"turtles\": every big historical causal force was positioned just so because of other, prior causal forces, and so on.Sheer contingency plays a significant role, as he points out how scenarios could easily have gone differently. One of the most important take-home messages was the persistent theme of balanced power among social groups. Political accountability, for example, simply cannot obtain by sheer force of justice alone. Temptations to power are too great. Likewise, because of basic human nature, political order is always at risk of succumbing to Fukuyama's favorite tongue twister, \"repatrimonialization\": the tendency to favor kin over impersonal procedures and merit.Fukuyama's approach jives well with one of my other favorite approaches to deep causal history, Why Nations Fail, by Acemoglu and Robinson.

The book guides the reader from pre-historical tribalism to the birth of Fukuyama\u2019s first true state (China) up to the 18th century as he assess civilizations at different times in history on dimensions of development related to state-building, the rule of law and accountable government.Well-written, if not necessarily a page-turning thriller, Fukuyama manages to paint a general theory of statehood and their success, failure and decay that manages to feel true and is neither so narrow as to feel like rehashed Marxist theory of economic development nor does it become too broad as to lose its insightfulness. Of course the historical conditions of each state examined are more complex than the book\u2019s narrative would allow, but the model he develops of competing interests and a delicate equilbrium rings true.I debated between a four- and a five-star rating (and would choose 4.5 if given the option), but enough of it has lingered with me that rounding up seemed to be the best choice.

He begins with pre-modern times and shows that Hobbes and Rousseau'w view of a pre-social humanity is wrong. Humans always have been social, the same as our primate ancestors. Like chimpanzees, our nearest living relatives, we band together in small kin groups led by males, and within these groups there is both competition and cooperation. However, outside of the kin group there is only competition, and in the zero-sum game that is the state of nature, host means predatory violence. Humans, however are endowed with speech and the ability to comprehend abstract thoughts, which allow us to build larger and larger social units. From these the state developed, first in China, much later in Northern Europe. Fukuyama writes that modem social life requires a strong, competent state, rule of law and accountability. He shows how in China the state developed without the other two components, which explains how much of China's history has been characterized by the abuse of the powerful, the insurrections of the powerless and foreign invasions. The enemy of statecraft is patrimonialism, when public powers and assets are appropriated by individuals, families or kin groups who try to turn it into inheritable property. Patrimonialism is humanity's default setting. When the state fails to come together or when it breaks down patrimonialism is always waiting in the wings, ready to take over. Some states failed to come together properly because the rule of law came about without a functioning state. That was the case in Spain and France in the late fifteenth and early fourteenth centuries. Here, successions of powerful monarchs and ministers attempted to create absolutist rule, but it didn't work because both countries had a long tradition of civil law that predates regal power. This rule of law protected the rights of the powerful, who eventually ended in buying up public functions and turning them into private and family property that could be inherited: repatrimonialization. In both countries this situation could not be reversed. In France it lead to revolution and the wiping out of powerful stakeholders. I'm Spain to secular decline that hasn't really been reversed. These institutions were brought to Latin America, where they really dug their roots. Powerful accountability without a functioning state is also calamitous. It was the case in Hungary, where a powerful nobility subjected the king to such string accountability that he couldn't rule. This allowed the nobility to exploit the peasantry ruthlessly and to cut down taxes so much that when the Turks came they took over the country easily. Fukuyama evaluates many other cases and reviews the ways in which countries may achieve political modernity, both historically and today, in the supposedly post-Malthusian world.

Fukuyama's work is two volumes and he urges the reader see the first and second as one work. I have not read the second yet, so these are my notes from the first. The closest book in style and subject matter to this work (2011) that I have read is Acemoglu and Robinson's Why Nations Fail (2012). Both books look at societies from prehistory onward and try to determine why good governance did or did not take root. Why Nations Fail is more comprehensive (looks at more societies), more interesting, and in my opinion better. Fukuyama's work can be read alongside it, along with Jared Diamond's Guns, Germs, and Steel (1997) and Rodney Stark's The Victory of Reason (2005). I expect Fukuyama's sequal to read a bit like Diamond's Collapse (2005). Fukuyama's history ends with roughly the French Revolution but he often jumps ahead to make analogies with modern-day America, China, and Russia as well as allusions to implications the past has for the present and future of these countries.Fukuyama wrote a critique of Acemoglu and Robinson's (AR) work, to which they penned a response. Fukuyama points out areas of perceived weakness in AR like China and England's Glorious Revolution, where Fukuyama provides much more detail and history. On modern China, however, there is actually little daylight between Fukuyama and AR. China is one state seeing relative prosperity without the rule of law because they have granted just enough in the area of property rights for people to respond to incentives. AR similarly write that China's extractive institutions loosened enough in the 1980s to allow people to respond to incentives... I find it odd that the authors don't argue from Fukuyama's work since it's so similar. I digress...Both Origins and Diamond's GGS begin with curiousity about New Guinea-- why did the West develop so differently than elsewhere? Why did different societies and governments evolve differently, and what is the connection between this and economic growth? What importance is the \"rule of law\" in good governance and economic prosperity? Why are some societies today more authoritarian than others, and what will this mean for the future?Definitions matter greatly in Fukuyama's book. Fukuyama is borrowing heavily from the work of Samuel Huntington, which Fukuyama found to be seminal but inadequate, motivating him to pen Origins. He is also utilizing many of the same definitions of Max Weber and Karl Marx, both of whom Fukuyama cites and critiques throughout the book. The most important is the definition of \"rule of law.\" It is essentially the definition I found in wikipedia of \"the legal principle that law should govern a nation, as opposed to being governed by arbitrary decisions of individual government officials.\" I would channel Thoma Paine and call Fukuyama's use of the term more as \"the rights of man,\" it's a respect for human life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness codified such that ruling authorities do not have ultimate power to infringe upon it. Fukuyama also pits Hobbes against Locke, rational choice theory economists (who Fukuyama dislikes) against behavioral economists, and Hayek against himself.One major point of the book is that history is contingent and the individualistic-oriented capitalist system that arose in England and is prevalent in the U.S. was not inevitable. Fukuyama's critique of AR's thesis (and likely Stark if he'd read him) is that The Glorious Revolution (17th century) would not have happened had there not already been an underlying cultural history of property rights and common law in England going back to the Norman invasion (11th century). The English people were already more individualistic than the Irish or Scots (more loyalty to clan), which helps explain the differing economic progress between parts of the later United Kingdom. Another major theme is that a relatively strong state is required to maintain the rule of law and defend property rights. (Early on, Fukuyama appears to be taking aim at \"Tea Party\" conservatives fomenting gridlock in the U.S. Congress and the Grover Norquists who want to \"drown the government in the bathtub.\" His introduction to the book already laments American political dysfunction, and his points about individual liberty being impossible seperate from a government powerful and feared enough to protect those liberties seem aimed more at a libertarian caricature than any real argument, which detracts from the book.) Fukuyama even quotes Alexander Hamilton at length to make the point that America's Founding Fathers understood this in their switch from the Articles of Confederation to a stronger Constitution.Fukuyama writes that the consensus of anthropology is that prehistoric societies were communal and not individualistic. That the individualism we see hailed in the West is a recent invention and likely unrealistic. Hunter-gathering necessitates division of labor and trade. Humans also have a \"natural propensity to violence\" and design institutions to both mitigate and channel it. While some rational choice theorists may surmise that violence is an outgrowth of economic necessity, Fukuyama dances around the idea of sin nature without mentioning it-- sometimes people kill each other for recognition or other random purposes. This propensity to violence requires defense against ourselves and an importance of establishing means of defense with those we trust-- so, tribal ties develop.Which came first, religion or kinship? Religion exists in all societies and mitigates the problem of cooperation and cheating on agreements. The author writes that religion cannot be explained by pre-existing environmental factors. Fukuyama appeals to game theory, writing that religion makes everything a tit-for-tat game instead of a one-off game like the Prisoner's Dilemma that leads to a sub-optimal equilibrium. Religion plays an important role in establishing a \"normative rule of order.\" People obey laws if perceived as fair, not just as a rational judgement made by cost-benefit analysis. The fairness of the law is determined by the norms established by religion. \"Grounding morals\" enhance cooperation and well-being.I'll note here that Fukuyama does not discuss any absolutes among those \"grounding morals\" across societies. Are there fundamental truths those morals and norms are based on? If so, what does it mean when those erode in a society? If norms matter, shouldn't today's emphasis on moral relativism be of concern to our society?From here, the author gives an overview of the history of political development in the East and West. How did states form? How does population density relate to the establishment of political institutions? The basic formula is natural resources + population density + tribal willingness to submit to a greater authority (probably for religious reasons) = the possibility of State creation. From there, you have the age-old question as to whether good governance is exogenous to (causes) economic growth or endogenous (results from) economic growth. In the end, Fukuyama writes that the causation runs both ways depending on the country you're looking at.Being relatively ignorant of China and East Asia, I found Fukuyama's retelling of millenia of Chinese history somewhat interesting but also too broad to draw conclusions from. The first modern state developed in China in the 3rd century B.C. In some cases, he describes a particular detail of Chinese history at length just because it's \"interesting\" (such as the story of Empress Wu), but seems unnecessary. War was a major driver of state formation in China, clans fought major wars almost non-stop and clans were willing to submit to a united power in order to gain protection. The author explains the basics of Confucianism and how Daoism rose out of famines and 40 million deaths during a self-coup that entrenched power among aristocrats in the 3rd or 4th century BC. The history of Chinese dynasties are ones of patrimonial consolidation. Eunuchs were trusted as advisors and with power because they were incapable of marrying and had no goal of passing something on to their descendents. (This is a common theme throughout history and cultures.) China has never had rule of law or a ruler submissive to a higher law-- such as those established by religious norms in the West. There was no source of law to appeal to. Rulers had the \"Mandate of Heaven\" - legitimacy of rule that gave them arbitrary power. But while China has never had the rule of law, it does not mean that it has always been ruled badly. Fukuyama writes that it's possible to have \"high quality authoritarian government,\" which is what China and Russia might or might not have today. Nonetheless, there were checks on the Chinese ruler's authority: It was a challenge to collect taxes over such a large area, which gave more distant lands more autonomy than local ones. There was no consolidated method for recording the taxes, especially if they were charged in-kind (goods). Leaders/governments typically do not maximize taxation, even where they can. There was also delegation of power from the ruler to the military, budget officers, managers, etc. This puts power in the hands of delegates over the delegator, they know and understand things he cannot and this keeps the ruler in check (in turn, the ruler's spies like the eunuchs keep those delegates in check). So, sometimes good government can be maintained without checks on executive authority. Modern China does not have true rule of law, but grows anyway. The property rights it has established are good enough to maintain its current rate of growth.Perhaps controversially, Fukuyama writes that the rule of law sometimes get in the way of economic progress and good governance. As China (and various periods of time in Russia) shows, the rule of law is not necessary for economic growth. Unsatisfyingly to me, Fukuyama chalks China's lack of historic economic growth to its lack of a \"spirit of maximization,\" and points to periods of history where progress and technological innovations were inexplicably abandoned and forgotten. This is not a problem for China now.Fukuyama writes significant chapters on Indian history as well. How the caste system developed, the benefits and drawbacks to the system, etc. Historically, Hinduism discouraged literacy and therefore encouraged poverty and dependence upon religious authorities. But various traits about Hindu religion and culture made it hard for an aristocracy to rise as well.There is a bit of focus on Roman history, though not as much because Western economic development has been covered by so many sources. Fukuyama looks at the development of Arabic political economy from Mohammed onward. I have recently read Hourani's History of the Arab Peoples and find that Fukuyama focused on history not included in that book, particularly the Mamluks of Egypt. Christianity and Islam are similar in that laws are based on norms of \"the book,\" and this creates a rule of law that holds rulers in check. Fukuyama writes that Mohammed was able to bind warring tribes together through his charisma and a common religion and text all could refer to. His system essentially left no one in charge, and rulers were judged legitimate by their adherance to Islamic teaching. He writes that the caliphate, consolidating power into the hands of a few legal interpreters, was a later invention. Even then, the Caliph was subject to removal under certain conditions and did not have unlimited power.The author writes that the Mamluks saved Islam. The Mamluks were military slaves, a practice that was later adopted by the Ottoman Turks and peculiar in world history. Mamluks were similar to eunuchs in China in that they were completely dependent upon their patron and often forbidden to marry-- hence they were not motivated by wealth for their own lineage. Eventually, the Mamluk orders gained power for themselves and became a caste defending themselves from other groups. This led to further decay and decline, replaced in power by the Ottomans. Fukuyama retells stories of the Ottoman's enslavement of Christian children in their elite Janissary corps from the 14th century to the 19th century. Like the mamluk's, they were forbidden to marry and janissaries often went on to be the most trusted advisors and have considerable individual power. Fukuyama details the cruelty of this practice but also its effectiveness in maintaining power among certain groups by enlisting and trusting others outside that group who had no ability or motive to take the power away. Eventually, janissaries were given the right to marry and became powerful enough to challenge the Sultans, which led to reprisals and wholesale slaughter and the order was abolished in 1826.The political history of Western Europe focuses mainly on England, France, and Denmark. The Catholic Church was the major agent in undermining clan/family loyalties as Rome sought to consolidate its power. At one point, 1/3 of the lands in the West were owned by the Church. It could collect a tax via a tithe, and the Church made it hard for its members to give inheritances. Pope Gregory forbid cross-cousin marriage. Priests were forbidden to marry for the same reason as the eunuchs and the jannisaries, they sought to serve the Church and Pope alone rather than their family interests. Kings and secular authorities also had begun entrusting priests with non-religious duties and to spy for them for the same reason of trust.The Investiture Controversy (11th-12th centuries) led to both sides seeing legal legitimacy. This led to a rediscovery of Justinian's Codex, which then became the basis for Western laws and future constitutions. The Reformation is therefore explained partly as a reaction to the Church's stamping out of kinship and clans, and Protestantism flourished where there had already been a cultural history of individualism apart from the church. One can see how the Enlightenment, with its emphasis on reason and individual liberty, created tension with both the government and the church since the two were so intertwined.Fukuyama explains feudalism in the European context, the contractual relationship between a lord and a vassal. This at least allowed for some property rights and inheritance. Common law developed early on, but Fukuyama critiques Hayek in that English common law was not necessarily developed spontaneously as Hayek claimed. Sometimes, ruling authorities intervened or changed the law to their wishes. Common law further requires strong institutions to keep it enforced. In England and mainland Europe, this institution was the Church. However, the rule of Law was strengthened in the West as systematic theology developed. Particularly after the Reformation, literacy was encouraged and this led to greater cooperation. Fukuyama seems to hold up Denmark as the model state, there Lutherans encouraged education and literacy, which led to the development of better laws and better adherance to them.The feudalism of the West is contrasted with the Serfdom of the East, particularly Hungary and Russia. Russia, like China, has a long history of autocrats ruling large areas. Fukuyama opines that the Russian model is the result of two centuries of rule by Mongols, who could be indiscriminately cruel and extractionary. In the aftermath of Mongol occupation, Muscovite rulers adopted the same practices and the Russian middle class was recruited to serve the Muscovite state. In Russia, the Orthodox church did not play the same role as its Catholic counterpart in the West-- it was not a bulwark against violations of the rule of law and there was no \"canon law.\" Literacy and adherance to Scripture were apparently not upheld as something to bind people together and keep the ruler in check. Fukuyama describes the terror of Ivan IV and its aftermath. Peasants lost the right of movement in Russia, and the government expropriated property without any pretense of legality. The author notes that alternatives have sprouted and periodically propspered in Russia, but then always been squashed, a pattern that appears to be continuing after the 1990s.Eastern Europe was relatively free until the 15th century. Hungary had a remarkable event in the Golden Bull of 1222, possibly inspired by the Magna Carta, where the King was forced to accept legal limits on his power. Hungary was later occupied by the Mongols and later the Ottomans.Fukuyama notes various errors made by Marx. He notes, as above, that English individualism existed long before the bourgeoisie and capitalism, giving evidence as far back as the 13th century. He also both embraces and critiques Weber, he particularly notes Weber's errors in looking at China and India.France's centuries of fiscal follies are highlighted, in parallel with Spain. I found these sections to be similar to Niall Ferguson's The Ascent of Money, although John Law came on the scene in France long after things had already gotten ridiculous. France, like other states in the book, needed to grow its tax revenue in order to fund endless wars and increasingly bloated government bureaucracy. As it borrowed, and borrowed again, it began to sell government positions and titles for cash. This created even more bloated government, rinse and repeat. The Spanish government looked to consolidate its power through the wealth of New World conquest, relying on slave labor for silver extraction. Fukuyama chronicles the chronic inflation and military defeats that took place in both France and Spain.So, what made England different than the other European countries. Fukuyama writes that this was not inevitable. First, solidarity in England was always more political than social. Second, common law and English legal institutions were broadly considered legitimate. They gave property owners a stronger stake as property rights were locally protected. Religion was also a unifying force in the kingdom throughout the period. The rule of law was strengthened after the Glorious Revolution but Fukuyama writes like it just cemented a culture already in place. A strong state remained in place for rule of law to be maintained.Fukuyama closes in chapter 30 with a look at modern political development and previews the next volume. He writes that competition is essential to innovation and good governance-- Russia forbid that competition when it forbid peasants from moving, which led to centuries of poor governance at all levels. Political decay is caused by 1) patrimonialism and 2) institutional rigidity. Compare this with AR's thesis that a nation's failure is caused by extractive economic institutions maintained by exclusive political institutions. There are similarities In some cases, Fukuyama writes that violence is necessary to cause change and eliminate the rigidity, although this is an unfortunate outcome. It's the irony that the rule of law that provides property right incentives sometimes creates too much rigidity. One hopes that the U.S.'s current political rigidity is temporary.The book oddly ends with a critique of Malthus and an explanation of the book in a Malthusian context.I give this book 4 stars out of 5. The attempts to relate things to modern American politics is problematic. When Fukuyama is quoting from modern economists like Gary Becker or Jeff Sachs, he does so with an annoyed contempt that is also somewhat of a turn-off. He is making interesting arguments, but I don't find the book nearly as compelling as Why Nations Fail."}, {"userName": "Aaron", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7494007-aaron", "userReview": "It is really tempting to explain things in terms of one or two factors, especially politics. I've been guilty of it myself; I've written \"it's geography, stupid!\" more times than I'd like to say. Yet, simplifying explanations of history, society, and government tend to be tools of evil (or stupidity). In the past, Christianity and Catholicism was used to explain imperialism under the guise of the White Man's Burden. The Nazi Reich based their explanations of history of the world through racial differences and genetics. And today, we see the rising spectre of religious and racial hatred in the alt-right movements in Europe and the United States. We see people (close to our President!) putting history as a battle of \"Christianity\" versus \"Islam\" and \"the White Man\" versus \"The Colored Man\". You also see some simple, not evil answers too. For example, somebody somewhere said something about guns and germs and steel explaining why some societies developed while other failed to. And while that certainly seems like a reason that the Americas failed to develop while Eurasia had millennia old states, it doesn't explain why some states became modern since they were freed from imperialism and while other states simply fell apart. Fukuyama, in The Origins, is described the origin of the state and political order to set context for his book... Political Order. To do this he brings out all the major social sciences that he can: anthropology, sociology, demography, geography, economics and, of course, history. This makes what is essential/The best AP World History book (that won't get you a 5) ever/.The history starts some six million years ago, while humanity was breaking off from our primate cousins, continues with the increasingly complicated relationship between families, tribes, and clans and ultimately culminates in the first state: imperial China. From Imperial China, we move west, to India, and then the Middle East, where we finally get to Europe to explore how the different histories of democracy unfolded until we get to the French Revolution.In each location, we get another piece of the puzzle to what makes a state a /good/ state. China, for example, was the first that was able to subdue the social human animal:Fukuyama considers a major factor and signal of political decay to be \"Patrimonialism\", or the genetic predisposition we have as humans to favor our families (through kin selection) or those who have allied with us (through reciprocal altruism). We might, as non-scholars, simply call it \"nepotism\" or \"letting your daughter hang out with you and foreign leaders.\" Time and time again, it becomes the state societies revert to, whether by weak political structure or overt attempts to build such a society. However, some societies, like India never get past patrimonialism. India's caste system is hyper-patrimonialism, where the entire structure of the universe is devoted to making sure that resources stay within a family line. Meanwhile, patrimonialism is subdued by religion in the eruption of Islam and the concept of the umma, or in the Catholic Church's insistence on her marriage laws being taken seriously (which, incidentally, meant the Catholic Church would acquire more and more resources). At the same time, religion allows there to be a highly developed rule of law: India, Western Europe, and the Muslim world all have a highly developed sense that their leaders are below God's law. Yet, in China or Russia (influenced by the Hordes) religion was subservient to the leader. Indeed, in China the religion never developed past ancestor worship!This rule of law is necessary for a state to be both powerful and to be checked. It means that the state and its ruler is beholden to something greater than itself. That means, depending on the era, religion but it also means literally just legal constitutions. It is powerful enough to bind the warriors of India to the brahmin religious class above them... but also keep kings from massacring entire towns.The third piece of political order is accountability. Accountability is built into our primeval social structures: if the Chieftan fails to be good, we just make somebody else Chieftan. You can literally look at the person while you do it. But as societies grow large, accountability disappears. It may arise, like in Eastern European kingdoms, where only certain portions of the noble class have any power over the ruler. Or it might fail to arise at all, as it did in China. Or even noble accountability might be squashed, as it was in France and Russia.The balance of these three- rule of law, accountability, and a modern meritocratic state- are what make political order. They, in turn, are embattled and bolstered by a constellation of religion, patrimonialism, and secular values. What made Europe explosively imperial? Guns, germs and steel! But other stuff, too."}, {"userName": "\u0625\u064a\u0645\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0628\u064a\u0634\u064a", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2017", "userURL":

It took me months to read and there are thoughts I would like to remember Having loved \"Sapiens\" with its sweeping but (IMHO) manager mainly correct statements, I found FF's detail refreshing To be fair, as another reviewer pointed out, even in this detailed treatise, there are, of necessity, sweeping statements. Having said that, the deliberate focus on primarily India, China, Mamluks, Ottomans and later (in Europe) France, Spain - and its colonies - Russia, Hungary, England and Denmark, was helpful in limiting this.Like many academics, FF sadly ignores the possibilities of a divine plan.At face value the accepted hypothesis makes sense. Once life emerged from the primordial mass, it evolved in a desperate and cruel attempt to survive at the expense of the genes closest to them, who competed in the same environment for the same things (read both Dawkins and FF to appreciate the grand and logical struggle from pre primordial history to the present day)Wars, environments, ideas, religions and sometimes hugely consequential tipping points (the resolution of Pope Gregory) have shaped history such that huge differences are embedded into our various cultures. Having said that, FF still indicates that there is an inevitable march towards democracy and capitalism (the beautiful lore that Napoleon's entry into Prussia foretold the endorsement of History)As a religious Jew, this encourages me.. just as did Hawkins when he spoke of the major similarities and smaller differences unfolding in space emanating from the singularity (freedom of choice not impacting on ultimate destiny) -but I'm no scientist, so don't tell him.In long, read this book if you are able. I will certainly attempt the follow upThank you Francis, and please don't be offended at my religious skew. I do understand your rational explanations for its existence"}, {"userName": "Assad Safiullah", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14558244-assad-safiullah", "userReview": "Overall, the book was informative and educational. The larger message, I felt, was two-fold. One, that humans are predisposed biologically to favor family ties. Two, that the state, the elite and the middle class in a careful balance form the basis of every political system. With the backdrop of accounts of the various prominent successful and unsuccessful states and groups of people starting from tribes from what is present-day Germany, China, Mongols, Russians and Ottomons, this was very convincing. It appears that for the majority of \"failed states\", the reason boiled down either to not being able to curtail the family biases of the public OR failing to keep one of the three (state, elites, middle class) from becoming too powerful and destroying the balance. I picked up on a few brand new learnings about concepts and elements of history like Janesaries, Brahmins, Confucianism vs Legalism and the vastly varied roles of religion in the different Western European states that I was fascinated to learn about for the first time ever. There were a few times when I lost interest in the details -- making this not a very easy read all the time but in the end, this was a worthwhile time investment."}, {"userName": "Filippo Pacifici", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33704238-filippo-pacifici", "userReview": "The Origins of Political Order is a massive and very insightful book. It provides a comprehensive historical analysis that goes from the beginning of the concept of state to the creation of liberal democracies.The treatise is very detailed and effective also thanks to the historical parallels that are presents in the whole book. These really help in making the arguments exposed very strong.As example I really liked the parallel between the creation of the state in China, India and in ancient Rome or the parallel between the French and the British societies in the centuries that drove to the french revolution.Most of the book revolves around the concepts of the role of the state of law, government accountability and state building as building blocks for the construction of a liberal democracy. These concept are eviscerated in details without becoming repetitive. This adds a lot of value to the book itself.Special mention is deserved by the notes on the causes of political decay. I specifically liked the point made by the author about the misalignment between present needs and institutions as a cause of decay. It is a very powerful message delivered with strong arguments."}, {"userName": "Davis Parker", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68777758-davis-parker", "userReview": "The Origins of Political Order is an ambitious effort that covers over two millennia of human political development across dozens of nations. Fukuyama spares the reader neither detail nor idiosyncratic fact in his search for the basis of political power and stability. He begins his book with discussions of kin and tribal level societies and the lessons we can gather from their development. Rather than existing as individuals in nature (as promoted by Locke), humans have always been social creatures that lived in groups and the concepts of ownership and property was usually shared on a communal level. Then, Fukuyama dives into a series of case studies: China, India, the Middle East, and Europe (which he then breaks up even more into studies of Spain, France, Hungary, Russia, and England) to compare the ways different states came into existence. Finally, he ends his book with a broader discussion of the necessary elements for political stability (a strong state, rule of law, and accountability) and how there are multiple paths to such an endstate. Overall, the case studies can be a bit in the weeds and boring at times, but Fukuyama's strength is in connecting the dots at the end and bringing his argument home. Even if you just skim through the case studies and focus on the beginning and ending sections of the book, you will be well served. My greatest takeaway was that political order necessitates BALANCE between the stakeholders at play and that the foundational pillars of American democracy are great not because they are the only path to successful state building and economic growth (see China), but because they provide guide rails to prevent our system from veering off course because of one bad leader. Yet, our own government's stability and legitimacy is built off its ability to successfully combat the crises of our time, and if it unable to adapt it will inevitably lead to ruin from either within (see French Revolution) or without (see Rome). Looking forward, policy makers should recognize that our own position of strength is not a function of deterministic history but a response to generations of leaders who made wise choices and led boldly when the time came, and that our future success is dependent on their ability to do the same. I look forward to reading Fukuyama's second volume."}], "description": "Virtually all human societies were once organized tribally, yet over time most developed new political institutions which included a central state that could keep the peace and uniform laws that applied to all citizens.
