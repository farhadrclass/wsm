Bird \u2013 a Goodreads author \u2013 has written a book, Bending With the Wind: Memoir of a Cambodian Couple\u2019s Escape to America. You won\u2019t find her name on the spine, although it is on the front cover. On the spine are the names \u201cSao and Sao\u201d \u2013 the names of the couple, Mr. Bounchoeurn Sao and Mrs. Diyana D. (born \u201cBounriem\u201d) Sao, who told their stories to my mother in over fifty hours of interviews. \tBounchoeurn\u2019s and Bounreim\u2019s stories are fascinating. Born and raised in different parts of rural Cambodia, they each escaped over the border to Thailand after the Khmer Rouge had taken over the country in a genocidal revolution that was eventually to kill fully one-fourth of the Cambodian population. Living in the same Thai refugee camp, they met, married and had a child. Soon after the child, their son Piset, was born, the family was able to emigrate to the United States as refugees. They settled in Olympia, Washington, where they met my parents and became a part of my childhood. \tBounchoeurn\u2019s story is one of an extremely intelligent, practical, and resourceful young man. Born in 1946 and raised by his mother and stepfather, a soldier, he was educated in a government-run highschool before joining the army himself in 1966 and marrying a girl his parents had chosen for him. Cambodia had already achieved independence from the French in 1953 and the country at the time was ruled by Prince Sihanouk. Bounchoeurn served in the army as a young married man, continuing to serve after the coup in 1970 that put Prime Minister General Lon Nol in power. The United States was fighting its own war \u2013 ostensibly to the east, in Vietnam \u2013 but was also bombing Cambodia in an effort to drive out the Viet Cong and had also jointly invaded Cambodia with the South Vietnamese, again in order to fight the Viet Cong. Bounchoeurn, who had been stationed on the Thai border and on the Lao border, joined a U.S. Special Forces Unit of Cambodian soldiers. Having learned Cambodian, French, Thai, and Lao, he added English to his list, and learned skills from the Americans that were to stand him in good stead. He was in Phnom Penh \u2013 separated from his wife and children \u2013 when the city fell to the Khmer Rouge in 1975, and left the city as the Khmer Rouge emptied. it. He worked as a slave laborer under the Khmer Rouge and eventually escaped to Thailand.\tBounriem, born in 1960, had a very different childhood. Born the youngest of a very large family, to doting parents that indulged her every whim, she grew up illiterate and spoiled in a kind of dreamy rural idyll that I can\u2019t even begin to imagine. The idyll soured with the death of her mother and her father\u2019s descent into alcoholism. When the Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia, she and several of her siblings walked over the Thai border \u2013 an extremely porous border, it seems \u2013 to join some relatives on the other side. Later, when the Thai government forced all the Cambodians to live in refugee camps, she and her brothers came to live in the camp where she was to meet and marry Bounchoeurn. \tWhen an author like my mother tells someone\u2019s story, the author shapes the story just as much as the subject does. The author is continually making a thousand choices: what to leave in, what to cut out, what to emphasize, what to elucidate; all of which form and mold the story. Bounchoeurn\u2019s and Bounriem\u2019s story, as told to my mother and written by my mother, is as different from any other potential version of the story as a Chippendale chair is from a Shaker chair. They\u2019re both chairs, and good for sitting, but the similarities end there. I can\u2019t speak to what my mother chose to leave out, but as for what she chose to include, I can certainly say that the plethora of details about the ingenious ways in which Bounchoeurn evaded capture and cheated death, and the details of Bounriem\u2019s spirituality and belief in her own reincarnation, make both Bounchoeurn and Bounriem come alive to me in a way that I \u2013 who knows both individuals personally! \u2013 had not heretofore felt. My mother was able, in telling both Bounchoeurn\u2019s and Bounriem\u2019s stories, to let each of their individual voices sing out. Further, my mother\u2019s familiarity with Southeast Asia during the 1960's served her well; in her interviews, she was able to elicit details about the minutiae of Cambodian daily rural life that made her telling of the stories especially vivid. \tYou may have \u2013 as I did \u2013 read the Wikipedia entries for \u201cCambodia\u201d and \u201cKhmer Rouge.\u201d You may even, back in highschool, have researched and delivered a short oratorical speech on the Khmer Rouge, which included the line (of which I was very proud): \u201cThe Khmer Rouge are rising again from their ashes like a malevolent phoenix.\u201d But by and large, these forays do not begin to answer the questions that begin with \u201chow.\u201d How did you survive? How, when so many were dying, did you manage to get enough food to eat? How did the Khmer Rouge control the people and control you? How did you feel upon leaving someone behind? How did you lose each other? How did you get out? How did you go on? My mother\u2019s book \u2013 for two people \u2013 answers those questions. \tOf course, this review is biased. In writing this review, it would be dishonest to not include the fact that my mother is the author or that I know the subjects. But \u2013 being as objective as I possibly can \u2013 I think that even were Bending With the Wind not my mother\u2019s book, I would still rate it as highly as I do, for the honesty and the depth with which she tells Bounchoeurn\u2019s and Bounriem\u2019s stories."}, {"userName": "Kirsten", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/349438-kirsten", "userReview": "I know virtually nothing about Cambodia or the Khmer Rouge, so this book was an education for me. It started a little slowly, but I got pretty engrossed finding out how Bounchoeurn and Bounriem would survive. There were sometimes extraneous details that felt out of place and unnecessary to the flow of the story - and sometimes I wanted more detail (such as at the end, with the revelations about Bounchoeurn's family). But overall this was really compelling."}], "description": "Before the Khmer Rouge takeover of Cambodia in April 1975, Sao Bounchoeurn and San Bounriem grew up in idyllic, though vastly different, circumstances. After a secondary education, Bounchoeurn entered the army, joined the Special Forces, and worked for the Americans. He became a slave laborer after the fall of Phnom Penh and eventually escaped to Thailand. In another part of Cambodia, Bounriem lived happily spoiled and uneducated. Fleeing from the advancing Khmer Rouge, she arrived at the same refugee camp as Bounchoeurn, where they met, married, and immigrated to America. This riveting memoir chronicles the couple's childhoods, their lives under the Khmer Rouge, their journeys to Thailand and later the United States, and their efforts to forge a new life. This remarkable tale offers an intimate look inside the terrors of the Khmer Rouge and an inspiring portrait of the immigrant experience in America.", "title": "Bending with the Wind: Memoir of a Cambodian Couple's Escape to America", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13784864-bending-with-the-wind", "average": 4.67, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348053132l/13784864.jpg", "reviews": 2, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5860536.Bounchoeurn_Sao", "name": "Bounchoeurn Sao"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5860537.Diyana_D_Sao", "name": "Diyana D.
