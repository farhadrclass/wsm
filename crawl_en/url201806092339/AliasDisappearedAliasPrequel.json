Okay, not really, but this novel did remind me very much of the popular board game and '80s film of the same name. There is even an attempted murder with a candlestick as the weapon! In Disappeared, the third installment in the Alias prequel novel series, SD-6 sends Sydney undercover to gather information at a summit between underground (and illegal) organizations, and the summit is being held at a decrepit gothic mansion where, shortly after the summit begins, people are mysteriously being murdered one by one. Like I said, it reminded me a lot of Clue. Even the members of the summit have distinct personalities and traits like the Clue characters do, and the character Carmina seems like a deliberate attempt at recreating Miss Scarlet. Some of the pacing is somewhat slow, which is why the novel gets four stars rather than the full five stars from me, but I really enjoyed the novel. Even though I do believe that it deviates a bit from the DNA of Alias (seeming more like a Sherlock Holmes story than an Alias episode or film), Lynn Mason's writing has drastically improved since her first Alias novel, Recruited, which is also the first novel of the series; there is a lot of really vivid and rich description of Sydney's surroundings, which I absorbed and appreciated as a reader. I also do really love the murder-mystery nature of Disappeared as I read and tried to determine who the murderer was. There is definitely a lot of foreshadowing, and there are a lot of clues regarding who the murderer is, but I had to go back and re-read certain \"scenes\" to catch them because they aren't glaringly obvious until you know. For that reason, it is a novel that probably warrants an entire re-read if you have the time and/or the desire, but seeing as how I feel satisfied with my experience, I will be moving on to the fourth installment, Sister Spy."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1583456-andy", "userReview": "If you're a fan of the series read this book - you'll probably like it. It's one of 4 prequals to season 1. Sydney in this series is not yet confident in her skills as an agent, nor is she particularly adept at handling every situation yet. It was nice to read her this way, because if you've seen the series, she eventually becomes basically, unflappable in the face of danger. I give it only 3 stars because I wanted more vivid description of the events, and the plot was fairly simple.That being said, if you're a fan of the series, don't hesitate to pick it up. It's a short, entertaining read."}, {"userName": "Garrett", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7857026-garrett", "userReview": "Like a fix of the show without the show, by way of Agatha Christie, and without the space to develop either the plotline fully, the characters with any depth, or Sydney's pre-show personality. Perhaps this worked better with the other prequels, but standalone, it was a little weak. Also: none of your favorite supporting characters are in this."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1473206-kimberly", "userReview": "I would actually give this book 2 1/2 stars.
