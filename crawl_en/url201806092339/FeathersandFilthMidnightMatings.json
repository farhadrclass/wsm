It was an accident in the heat of the moment that the author kind of downplayed by having Magnus forgive Fabian immediately after it happened even though Magnus was scared for his life. Okay, some people will probably go on the offensive about this being one reaction that can occur in reality but for me it just felt like Joyee Flynn was telling the abused to forgive their abusers when they apologized. The same scenario happens in reality everyday to someone and their abusers do apologize but in the end the abused continues to be abused even if their spouse or son or daughter or just a bully from school apologizes for the behavior. I also felt like the abuse of Magnus was downplayed because the author made Fabian seem like a naive individual who is socially stunted.2) I found that Magnus and Fabian's character development wasn't consistent. Magnus was pretty outgoing and aggressive in the beginning and while reading the story it just felt like he was becoming a lot more docile. I liked that he was willing to protect Fabian and that he could wield a gun if he needed to. Fabian was the total opposite of Magnus in the beginning and he became pretty aggressive and dominant at times in the book but then would go back to being shy with low self-esteem.3) The issue on children between Fabian and Magnus was a bit annoying and kind of bored me a little. They kept going back and forth on it and in the end I just felt like Fabian didn't want children and was just going with the flow of things.4) In general I just felt that this book wasn't as good as the other books in the series. How can this be when Stormy Glenn, Joyee Flynn and Gabrielle Evan each wrote about 5-6 books each for the series??? I just didn't get the wow, cool or omg factor I had in the other books. It could have been my mindset when I was reading this book that effected my opinion of the book. I may have to read it over in the future...until then the rating of this book will be 2 stars for me."}, {"userName": "Serena Yates", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2798257-serena-yates", "userReview": "What made this volume fun to read for me was yet another unusual pairing that came out of the elders' idiotic idea to force all paranormals to mate outside their species. In this case it actually works against them since one of them is endangered and needs to mate inside their species so they can repopulate (or so the elders have decreed). But, I'm jumping ahead. So, we have a bird of paradise and an ogre here, and as if that difference isn't significant enough, they also each carry a dark secret which makes it sound almost impossible that they'd ever get along.Fabian is an ogre, and he falls for Magnus on sight. He is very protective, but can't believe Magnus is really interested in him. Especially when Magnus reveals he hates ogres... So, of course, Fabian lies and gets into even more trouble.Magnus is a rare bird of paradise and has a very dark secret linked to ogres in his background. The revelation of Fabian;s species always drives them apart, and that is only the beginning.Add a somewhat mysterious aunt, an old boyfriend of Magnus's and the overbearing attitude of the meddling elders, and you can see why the resulting ride might be a little rough. If you like unusual shifter stories with a dark secret, if a \"nesting\" male bird mate sounds interesting, and if you have enjoyed the other books in this series, then you may like this one as well."}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6628510-christy", "userReview": "Oh my god how could you not love Fabian. Big, gentle, bumbling, klutz with a ton of issues that he just unloads on Magnus right off the bat. He's adorable and made me think of Shrek. Yes, I went there.......sue me!Oh, these two are so cute and have such a crazy intertwined history that they are completely ignorant of when they mate. They are wonderful together and so sweet when they work out their difficulties. A very sweet and fun story."}, {"userName": "Kelly H.

I like how they were portrayed, especially during those times of insecurity and indecision. Normally I don't tolerate abuse of any kind in books, but I felt for both characters and I can understand where they were coming from in the heat of the moment. While it was still wrong of Fabian to hit Magnus, that doesn't take away from the fact that Magnus stormed into Fabian's aunt's house in a rage. Magnus put his hands on Aunt Jean. No matter that he just grabbed her, he still did it while in a rage. You can't know what someone will do in that situation. So while they were both wrong,the only way to move on would be to forgive each other.Overall, it was good."}, {"userName": "Meggie", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3846477-meggie", "userReview": "Actually I have to admit to liking this created story.

Well maybe a little smelly but o oh when they shift. The rest of the time, they're just like the rest of us. A lot bigger but pretty much the same. Magnus is a sexy little thing and pretty feisty.

Yeah...way too much specially combined with all the UPAC troubles brought along too. Way too weird and just plain depressing. I couldn't even see them as good for each other. Too many contradictions and problems and surely not enough time spent together besides sex. They talked briefly. They had sex. They talked briefly. They had sex. They talked briefly. They had sex...you get the picture. Yeah there was a lot of info dump and hysterics. Was it enough for them to know each other and fall in love? Highly unlikely and I simply wasn't convinced.

There are currently 20 books in the series, each book is written by either Joyee Flynn, Gabrielle Evans or Stormy Glenn.
