Instead of running for the hills to find safety and infection free zones, survivors decide to make a stand in Clayfield, Kentucky. Having the foresight that most would not, they try to become sustainable on their own as opposed to looting the local Wal-Mart. This saga really portrays the old adage of 'Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime'.The devil is in the details; and there is no shortage of exquisite description in this series. I love when I can get lost in a book, close my eyes and see a scene play out like a movie. To me, that is the sign of a talented writer. Gregory's writing is so fantastically detailed that I can nearly feel the loss of characters, the pain of a bite, the sting of deception, and the disgust of the horrible acts man has the capacity to carry out.Click here to read my entire review."}, {"userName": "Jeff Jellets", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15694222-jeff-jellets", "userReview": "\u201cIt\u2019s getting to be that we\u2019re losing all the good folks. Before long all that\u2019ll be left is the riffraff and monsters.\u201dWith All That I See, author Shane Gregory delivers a rock solid sequel to his previous book, The King of Clayfield, and continues a post-apocalyptic zombie survival series that remains at the top of the genre. Very much a continuation of the previous volume, Gregory offers resolutions to many of the questions left unanswered from the previous book, while at the same time, artfully growing the world he has infected with the Canton B virus beyond the boundaries of the titular town of Clayfield. Gregory\u2019s use of first person narration is masterful, not just for the voice it gives the main character, but also in its use of limited omniscience. The narrator (and by extension the reader) can see only so far, and it\u2019s what lurks just beyond our field of view that generates much of the tension in the novel. There is a sense that things are moving just out of sight \u2013 like rats in the dark \u2013 and creeping up on the protagonists. There are also times when events are hauntingly unclear, when we catch only a few grisly frames of a longer movie, and must (like the narrator) piece together the in between, leaving us to imagine not just the story written on the page, but also the grotesqueries that happen just off-camera. Just as importantly, I continue to appreciate Gregory\u2019s ability to play with morality \u2026 and moral ambiguity. One of the great things about the first King of Clayfield novel was that, despite the apocalyptic nature of event, there were a number of people who remained \u2026 well \u2026 pretty good people. Disasters seldom flip a switch in the human head and turn average folk from law-abiding shopkeepers to ruffians \u2013 in fact, disasters tend to pull people together, and it was good to see those elements in the first book.But by now, the horrors unleashed by the Canton B outbreak have eaten-up (literally) a good deal of the upstanding citizenry allowing human predators more prominent space up near the top of the food chain. Suddenly, the scruples of the narrator \u2013 both about sex and killing \u2013 seem rather Pollyanna and na\u00efve. But Gregory is rather cleverly luring us down a dark moral alley where even (justifiably) dispatching a few would-be rapists poses serious consequences for the characters. Who is perceived as villain and who as hero is flipped topsy-turvy by the middle of the book, and the main character is left having a very hard time keeping his head above a deep pit of dangerous moral quicksand. With plenty of damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you don\u2019t-choices \u2026 that smack of the very hard choices any leader \u2013 any king \u2013 must make for his (or her) realm to survive, there\u2019s a fearful tempering of the characters as the book progresses. While the first book in this series might have been all about showing us that there was only one man with the heart to be The King of Clayfield, this book is all about the next step. Becoming king unfortunately requires the ability to make bitterly difficult decisions, the fortitude to execute those decision, and the ability to live with heart wrenching sacrifices.Of course, all of this is just icing on the cake of what is at its heart a damn fine zombie survival story, full of twists , turns, and macabre encounters (Gregory\u2019s dogs will make you shiver!) that kept me turning page after page deep into the night. Perhaps the only reservation I can give is that if you haven\u2019t read the first book in the series, pick up that one first (and why wouldn\u2019t you \u2018cause it\u2019s just as awesome?); All That I See is a lot more rewarding if you know the characters and events from the preceding novel.Can\u2019t wait to crack the cover of Book Three: Fire Birds!"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11168164-emily", "userReview": "[ They have strong reason to expect that menstruation (ugh, see my review of The King of Clayfield) draws the zombies like delicious zombie nip, which while it was an unconfirmed theory, they had a strong correlation with Jen, but rather than get to a safe area with plenty of food and water before the thing starts, they get caught completely unprepared, with no supplies, in a terrible situation.

Gregory's vision of the zombie apocalypse, as told from the view of a small town museum curator, is not to be missed. ALL THAT I SEE was a page turner, just as the first novel in the series was. Our unnamed protagonist, (believe me, I looked and looked and Gregory does not name him)continues to battle the dead and the living as well, in and around his hometown of Clayfield, Kentucky. When confronted with the question of why he doesn't leave. His response rings true when he says that one place is as good as another, besides, home is home. Our hero, who sees himself as a reasonably good guy trying to survive, is quickly becoming a survivor. You see him evolve as the story unfolds. He does what he must to stay alive but never seems to become amoral, as do many of the other survivors he encounters. He's no super soldier, no survivalist, merely an ordinary guy confronting and coping with an extraordinary time. His haunted memories for a dead love and his indecisive response to the affections of a beautiful young survivor merely add to the humanness of our narrator. ALL THAT I SEE, as well as the first novel, compel the reader to ask: What would I do in such a situation? That's the sort of question that makes for, in my opinion, a fine character study and a good read."}, {"userName": "Deanndra Hall", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23583518-deanndra-hall", "userReview": "Everything I said about this book's predecessor, The King of Clayfield? Go there and read my review. Ditto.This is a continuation of the predicament in which the small Kentucky town of Clayfield finds itself following an outbreak of a virus that turns the residents into - you guessed it - zombies. I was itching to read this book, the second in the series, because I wanted to know what happened to everyone from the first book. I wasn't disappointed, except that it ended. Book 3 is bound to be out soon.As for the book itself, it was exactly like the first - a well-written, well-structured, easy read, sound in its mechanics. I get very tired of trying to read books that have so many errors and structural problems that it's almost impossible to get through them. The books in this series are not like that in any way. They're also very creative. The narrator, who is the male protagonist, comes up with ideas for survival that most people would never think of, so it's obvious this author did his homework. I have a huge appreciation for that.And by the way, the poster on the wall of the club? Didn't see that coming.Overall, another out-of-the-ballpark entry into this series. Can't wait to pick up the next one.- Deanndra Hall,Author of the Love Under Construction series andThe Neighbors of Harper's Cove series"}, {"userName": "Beckie Parks", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3244793-beckie-parks", "userReview": "***THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***This book starts about a month after the first book ended. It started off decently enough, catching the reader up with the activities of the main character. However, once a new character was introduced it went off the rails quickly! Yet again the only people they seem to meet up with are scumbags. There are no decent people left in the world, save for the main character and the few in his group. The one group that is very briefly introduced that didn't seem to be scumbags were idiots that ran off without helping anyone - including their own friend - as soon as they were rescued. The formula of every event in the book seems to be the same: new people introduced/run in with known group, bad stuff happens because they are bad people, main character does something stupid and gets separated from friends, main character battles living/living dead, main character searches for group. Sometimes he finds them, sometimes not.This book was even more disappointing than the last. It seems to me that a lot of mundane and useless events were added to the book just to stretch it so the series could become a trilogy. The ending of this book came very abruptly without anything really being solved or a goal being met."}, {"userName": "Ellen Mandly ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2728294-ellen-mandly", "userReview": "5 Stars! Even though I'm a bit skeptical about the transfer of the virus angle as it goes against everything I've ever read or watched - I love this series! Fantastic narration and a wonderfully human and extremely likeable lead character who gets smarter and tougher every book!! Forget Fear the Walking Dead (1st season was lousy!) THIS should be the next zombie/post apocalyptic book made into a series! I'm going to try to restrain myself from delving into book 3 since it appears that its the last in the series.

If you have ever wondered what would happen in a small rural southern town to a regular Joe when the zombie apocalypse comes - this book is a darn good start. Not an action barn burner but a decent amount of suspense and a lot of \"realism\" in the writer's approach.
