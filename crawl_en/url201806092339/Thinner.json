Me, I don't believe in God. But if I saw him, I would. I wouldn't just go around saying 'Jesus, that was a great special effect.' The definition of an asshole is a guy who doesn't believe what he's seeing. And you can quote me.\u201d Richie \u201cThe Hammer\u201d Ginelli\nWilliam Halleck is a damn fine lawyer, a rising star in his firm, and well liked by judges and police officers. His life was coming together nicely and without too much extrapolation he could probably anticipate the continuing arc of his success. There was really only one thing that he was fighting against on a daily basis...his weight. The scales were not his friend. He was a stress eater, a man who would rather have two Big Macs peeking out of their wrappers than the goosepimple naked Coors Twins cooing his name. He is 6\u20194\u201d and weighs 251 pounds, which isn\u2019t exactly fat if you are a professional football player bristling with heavy musculature, but if you are a white collar worker who doesn\u2019t exercise and eats high calorie, high carb meals from breakfast until bed, the weight gain is going to settle right around your bread basket. I\u2019m 6\u20194\u201d and weigh 200-205. If I were to put on 50 pounds, I would be obese according to all the BMI charts. Given the fact that I\u2019m retired from any form of athletics except shooting a few hoops in the driveway and going for walks, that 50 pounds would be the worst kind of weight gain, and I would be looking for new pants several sizes larger. Some reviewers/readers have questioned whether Halleck at 6\u20194\u201d and 251 pounds was actually obese, which might say something about the current state of the American waistline. A nation floating down the river deNILE. Halleck was a chubby checker, unable to see his feet when he was standing upright on a scale. Pissing was simply an act of faith because for Halleck to see willie perform, he would need to put mirrored tiles on his bathroom floor and walls. Libido is usually the first to go when people become overweight. Their desires and lusts are exchanged for french fries, strawberry pie, and milkshakes, but Halleck didn\u2019t have that problem. In fact, at the moment that his life was about to go off course, he was almost ready to cross off a bucket list item right up until the time he\u2026hit a woman with his car.His wife, Heidi, out of the wild blue decides to be spontaneous. She\u2019s not a prude, but she has never given any indication that she was uninhibited enough to go searching for Billy\u2019s fishing tackle while he was steering a moving vehicle. Now, he didn\u2019t just hit any woman. Oh no, to completely screw up your life you have to hit a gypsy with a vengeful father. Taduz Lemke is a gypsy patriarch who might be anywhere between 106-120 years old. He knows things that the rest of the world has forgotten. \nRobert John Burke stars in the 1996 film version.When he touches Halleck\u2019s cheek and whispers the word\u2026thinner, William starts to lose weight at an alarming rate. He has been cursed, not just cursed, but gypsy cursed. \u201cYou were starting to sound a little like a Stephen King novel for a while there.\u201dWait, what was that about Stephen King? Back in the late 1970s and through the mid-1980s, Stephen King was writing more books than could be published. In those days publishers believed that an author could only publish one book a year successfully. King decided to create a pseudonym as Richard Bachman so he could publish more than just one book a year. He was also having doubts about his own success. Had he just gotten lucky? Could he produce a best selling book without Stephen King emblazoned on the cover? The Bachman books were doing ok, but they did a lot better after a bookseller named Steve Brown in Washington D.C. thought the style shown by Bachman was very similar to the writing style of Stephen King. \nMeet Mr. Richard Bachman. The actual subject of the photo is Richard Manuel, the insurance agent of Kirby McCauley, who was King's literary agent.The truth was out, and Thinner became a bestseller. Brown showed a lot of class. He went to the publisher first to show what he had discovered and asked what he should do. King called him and asked him if he would like to do an interview to tell the world how he made his discovery. For those interested, here is a link to Brown\u2019s discussion of the discovery: http://www.liljas-library.com/bachman...So the reference to himself that he put in Thinner was a tongue in cheek, knee slapping moment of poking fun at himself. \nStephen King and Tom Holland (director of the film) on the set. King had a cameo role as Dr. Banger. Halleck is now losing two to three pounds a day, and that is with eating as much food as he can stuff into his stomach. He is desperately searching for the gypsy caravan so he can convince the prehistoric gypsy to take the curse off, but the flame of vengeance still burns in the heart and soul of Taduz Lemke. He is going to need some convincing. Halleck knows just the guy. Richie \u201cThe Hammer\u201d Ginelli, an Italian mobster whom Halleck helped defend in court, is a man with a code regarding helping friends in need. Out of all the people Halleck has tried to explain his situation to Ginelli is the only one who believes him. Ginelli is a terrific character. He is certainly someone you will not forget. I thought that Stephen King, erhh Richard Bachman, put real flesh on the bones of all the characters. The plot is taut like a quarter bouncing off a nubile bottom and crackles like a corn crib on fire. In my opinion, one of the best Stephen King, erhhh Richard Bachman, books I\u2019ve ever read.

His perfect life is upset when he accidently run over an old Gypsy woman when he was *ahem* distracted behind the wheel. Since Billy is one of the solid taxpayers who plays golf with all the right people the whole mess is quickly tidied up in court without him getting so much as a ticket. However, another old Gypsy puts a whammy on him and suddenly Billy can\u2019t keep weight on no matter how much he eats. As he becomes a shadow of his former self Billy sets out on a desperate quest to track down the Gypsy and try to convince him to lift the curse of growing thinner.This was the last of the novels Stephen King released under the pen name of Richard Bachman before his cover was blown shortly after its publication. (In fact, he gets cute by having a couple of characters describe the situation as sounding like a King novel.) As with the other Bachman books it seems like Uncle Stevie ran leaner and meaner in this one. He keeps the story focused tightly on its key concept, but he\u2019s also delivering some nice subtext about American culture. We\u2019ve got a nicely ironic curse of a man\u2019s thoughtless greedy consumption being turned back on him as well as exploring the hypocritical way that the decent folk of New England will have their fun with the Gypsies and then run them out of town.One of the strongest points here is in Halleck as a character. Billy seems like a decent guy who genuinely feels guilty about the death he inadvertently caused, and he\u2019s got the brains and courage to face up to the bizarre situation and act to save himself. However, he also went along with sweeping the whole mess under the rug, and he\u2019s willing to turn to a dangerous friend when he\u2019s really in trouble. So there\u2019s a nice mix in him that he\u2019s both somewhat willing to take responsibility even as he trying to wriggle out of the consequences of it. It\u2019s a very solid piece of horror fiction that makes me wish that King would have gotten to do more Bachman books before the secret leaked out. He has published others under the name, but none were ever quite as good as the early ones."}, {"userName": "Paul O'Neill", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17331573-paul-o-neill", "userReview": "Loved it, it's every bit as good as I remembered and more.

Aside from the fact that King wrote this, the premise really made me curious as to what the novel was all about. It was about a man who got cursed, and now he's losing weight everyday, and he fears that it will come to a point where he'll turn into nothing.Everything was good, but nothing was great. That's the main problem of the novel for me. While the start of the novel was batshit amazing and fast paced, the middle and the end was a huge dragger and almost made me not finish this. The reason he got cursed was witty, but after King revealed that, everything went downhill. The events were terribly uninteresting, and there was this fucking chapter, chapter fucking 22 that was so boring at first, and was too fucking long, it made me stop reading the novel for a few days. The chapter did improve halfway through, but I'm still annoyed with the length, and the boredom the first half exuded. The characters were satisfactory, but all I can say is that I only liked 2 characters in the whole novel. The main character Billy, and his friend Ginelli. All of the others were either mediocre or plain old annoying. I've read a lot of King's books, so I'm safe to say that his characters are most of the time spectacular. This novel was lacking, sad to say.I honestly can't really commend the plot development because I didn't like the middle to about 85% of the novel. It was a lot dragging and a bunch of useless things were said. I know the novel is damn short already, but it could've been shorter. The gypsies were a bit interesting, but they also lost their funk sooner than expected.The redeeming quality of the novel after that terrible middle part was the ending. It was well thought out and obviously something King would throw in. Such a huge turn of events for the main character. He just can't seem to win.3/5 stars. I almost gave this a two, but like I said above, the ending was good. Not my favorite King book, and I'm sadly disappointed with this. I know a lot of my friends enjoyed this, but it just wasn't for me. My favorite thing about the novel was the premise, and that's obviously not a good thing."}, {"userName": "Ginger", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097149-ginger", "userReview": "This was an addicting and enjoyable book to read!It\u2019s a great revenge novel and I enjoyed reading about how Billy Halleck goes from a big, fat man to something rather morbid.Billy Halleck, an upscale attorney accidentally hits and kills an old gypsy woman in his car when she steps out from the sidewalk. Now is he guilty of vehicular manslaughter or not? Unfortunately for Billy, an old gypsy man believes he is and puts a curse on him. The old gypsy man touches his check and says \"THINNER\".Or did he?

This is a story of revenge, being resentful towards others and having to live with the decisions you make in life.King really did well on the character development in this book and the ending sure blew me away! I did not see that coming.This is a must read for Stephen King fans or anyone that loves creepy ass books."}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "Overweight lawyer William Halleck strikes and kills a gypsy woman who is crossing the street. He is acquitted but a relative of the woman touches Halleck's cheek and curses him. Now he's losing three pounds a day with no end in sight. Can he track down the gypsy man and get him to remove the curse or will he waste away to nothing?What's so scary about a fat guy losing weight? A lot, it turns out. Never has getting a tug job in the car from your wife gotten someone into so much trouble. I felt for old William Halleck and his curse. I also shared his anger toward his wife because of her reaction to the whole thing.As with most King/Bachman books from this era, the story is shorter than his later works, more killer and less filler. Bachman references Stephen King a couple times, weird since now everyone and their senile grandma knows the two are one and the same. The more King I read, the more I realize he returns to the same concepts repeatedly, be it unprepared people going up against staggering odds, preaching against over-reliance on technology, or fascination with drifter/carnie culture and people getting shot in the hand with slingshots. Different parts of this book seemed like dry runs for parts of Wizard and Glass, Joyland, and Doctor Sleep.If I had to pick out something to gripe about, it would be the involvement of Ginelli. It seemed like Halleck just stepped aside and let Ginelli do all the heavy lifting near the end. The ending more than made up for that, though.Four out of five stars.

King writes an unrelenting cause and effect that is terrifying because it does not jump out and yell BOO! but rather walks quietly up to you with a mask on and a butcher knife, like John Carpenter\u2019s Michael Myers, a slow-motion dream scape of fear.Thinner shares these qualities with other of King / Bachman books like The Running Man and The Long Walk. From the opening pages, we know what the central focus is and King never lets us go, we\u2019ve been strapped into the carnival ride, and we\u2019re off. Like the best roller coasters, we can see the drops and curves ahead, and we\u2019re just clink-clinking and moving towards the fun.In Thinner, an overweight lawyer runs over an old gypsy woman and his legal friends work it out so he walks Scott free. Or does he? An old gypsy man seems to have other ideas and perhaps lays down an old-fashioned curse. Paunchy attorney begins to quickly get \u2026 thinner.Like so much of King\u2019s most successful stories, he plants an otherwise pedestrian idea into the flower pot and then waters it to produce some kind of scary mutant, man eating plant. The normal becomes para-normal and the everyday becomes Samhain with pagan curses raining down with old testament vigor.King also populates this book with some of his best characters, Richard Ginelli and Taduz and Gina Lemke breathe fresh and vibrant life into this already good story.Relentless, spooky and fun, like the a roller coaster \u2013 or a freight train coming down the tracks that you\u2019re stuck on."}, {"userName": "Danger", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5184971-danger", "userReview": "I first saw the movie for this back in the 90s, long before I read this book. And if you've never seen the film, believe me when I say, it's bad. It\u2019s AWESOMELY bad. Overacted, terribly-paced, full of dumb effects and the worst \u201cfat suit\u201d I\u2019ve ever seen. But, for some reason, I can't help but love it. I\u2019ll watch it over and over again on Netfilx like it was reruns of The Office. Maybe I just like terrible movies. I don\u2019t know.But, that said, I've never read this book. Never even thought about it, until I saw a used copy for sale at a local bookstore for just a few bucks. \u201cWhy not?\u201d I said. And I picked it up.Let me just say: THIS BOOK IS GREAT. Soooooooo much better than that crap movie. I\u2019m not a huge Stephen King fan by any stretch, but he really nailed it with this one. Maybe I\u2019m a Richard Bachman fan then? THINNER never rambles, or wastes times. Everything is tied into moving the plot forward. And King fills in the blanks with interesting and varied metaphors that never seem forced or tired. It's a book built to be read quickly. And that's just what I did.As far as the plot goes, it\u2019s pretty simple. A body horror story about a fat lawyer who accidentally kills a gypsy\u2019s daughter, who is then cursed to lose weight until he (presumably) dies. It doesn\u2019t really revel in the supernatural - aside from the entire story being catalyzed by a \u201cmysterious force\u201d - and instead focuses more on the visceral breakdown on the protagonist\u2019s body, sanity, and life. As such, it\u2019s easy to lose yourself In Billy Halleck\u2019s plight, and to connect with the \u201chero\u201d who is really more deplorable than he is likable.Again, not being a huge reader of King, it\u2019s hard to say where this ranks amongst his other works, but for me, this was my kind of story delivered in my kind of style.

He's an up-and-coming lawyer, has a wife and a teenage daughter, and a nice home. He is also overweight, a fact which his doctor is always reminding him of. One day while driving, Billy accidently sideswipes an old gypsy woman who is crossing the street and kills her. Billy is cleared of any charges for this incident, as he is good friends with the police and the judge. There's also no love lost between law enforcement and the gypsies, since the police just want the gypsies out of their town. When Billy is leaving the courthouse, he is stopped by a very old ancient looking gypsy man who gently caresses Billy's cheek with his finger, and whispers one word to Billy...\"Thinner\". Soon after this, Billy finds that he is losing weight without even trying. As each day goes by, Billy loses more and more weight and he realizes at the rate he's going, he will soon be a human skeleton if it doesn't stop. He believes that the old gypsy man placed a curse on him. Other people are believing that Billy is losing his mind. Billy then decides he must seek out the old gypsy man and get him to undo the curse.I was looking for something a bit different to read and this book definitely delivered. The story had great atmosphere with very vivid descriptions. I really liked and felt for Billy and could feel his horror right along with him. The gypsies in the story were really brought to life. There was such a sense of foreboding in the air whenever they were around, especially Taduz Lemke, the gypsy that cursed Billy. I also enjoyed Billy's gangster friend Ginelli who was there for Billy when Billy was at his most desperate. The book was creepy, strange, bizarre, and outlandishly funny at times, too. It was extremely entertaining, a lot of fun, and never boring."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477266-sarah", "userReview": "3.5 stars. This was my first Stephen King novel. I thought that it was good enough but not like great or anything. I had two main problems with it. The first problem was with the pacing of the novel. The first half was good but when I reached the halfway point, I was confused because I felt like the conclusion should have been coming. The story was slowly building up from page one and it was creepy, ominous and eerie but then a good 25% of the novel just dragged on and on. I just thought the road trip William went on was just so boring and I wanted it to end which is never a good thing when reading a book. The second problem I had was with the characters. I didn't like any of them except for Ginelli. He was the only entertaining character. Every character except Ginelli and William felt like cardboard cutouts and they weren't fleshed out enough for me. I was especially disappointed that King didn't flesh out the gypsies as I would have been really interested in finding out more about them. I thought the story itself was good. It was quite creepy and as the story went on, it just got more and more horrifying but in a subtle way. I just wish that the story and characters were better because it would have made me like this book more. I thought the end was good and I liked it. I enjoyed the writing. Apart from a few passages, I was really engaged with the story because of the writing and I thought the writing had quite an addictive quality to it. I would recommend this story if you are a King fan and I would read more by Stephen King."}, {"userName": "Mia Nauca", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33138824-mia-nauca", "userReview": "3.5 estrellas.

I started reading Thinner back in April of 2017, and I finished it almost a year later. This has been the book that put me into the biggest reading slump of my life so far, but it was also a book that made my reading slump finally end. Now that I finally read it, I guess that the book deserve its review. So, lets begin. Thinner is a story of an attorney called Billy Halleck, and the curse that was laid upon him by a gipsy. Billy was an overweight man, and the curse was the starting point of Billy's weight loss. However, loosing weight had a downside to: it never stopped. The concept of this novel was quite interesting to me. The beginning of the book gripped me, but, unfortunately, after a hundred pages or so, the story slowed down. To be honest, it became boring as hell. That was the part when I put this novel on a pause. After months and months, I finally started reading it again, and boy, oh boy, did the book become so much better after that. The second half of the novel gripped me again and it did not let go until I read the final page. Not in a long time did a book leave this big of an impact of me. The ending blew me away, and left me wanting for at least a hundred more pages. However, even though it did leave me wanting more, I was satisfied with the way the story ended. When I thought about it, there is not a better way to end a story like this one. This definitely was not King's (or Bachman's) best work, but the book still left a huge impact on me, and because of that, I had to give it five stars (4.5 to be exact).

Just that one word, sent on the wafting, cloying sweetness of his breath. 'Thinner.' And before Halleck can jerk away, the old Gypsy reaches out and caresses his cheek with one twisted finger. His lips spread open like a wound, showing a few tombstone stumps poking out of his gums. They are black and green. His tongue squirms between them and then slides out to slick his grinning, bitter lips.Thinner.Richard Bachman was not a very nice guy, and \"Thinner\" shows why. It was the last Bachman novel, before the cover was finally blown and it turned out that Richard Bachman was in fact Stephen King. Or as King prefers to say, his dark half. The fingers that typed out the Bachman books might have been King's, but the one who sent words to the fingertips was old Richie. The creep from grocery stalls, airports and train stations, whose novels were printed without any sort of advertising and promotion, and who gained his reputation by word of mouth alone.In fact, \"Thinner\" sold 28 000 copies when it was published, which is over ten thousand more than King's collection \"Night Shift\" did several years earlier. Of course, when it turned out that both were copyrighted by the same guy the sales of \"Thinner\" went through the roof.It's hard for me to choose a favorite from the Bachman books, but I can safely say that Thinner is a perfect closure to a career that ended much too soon. The Bachman novels were all pretty grim, but I think that Thinner, together with The Long Walk, are the most thought-provoking and interesting.Also, Thinner is the sole Bachman novel that can be classified as horror, though it is much more than that.As with \"Quitters, inc.\", a classic short story about giving up smoking, King took another of the American nightmares and turned it around - weight. Billy Haleck, the protagonist, is a succesful lawyer who also happens to be fifty pounds overweight. Billy is camping at the border of heart attack country; his doctor, his wife, hell everyone tells him to drop some pounds, but Billy just can't get enough of the sweet taste, of the sour taste, of all delicious tastes of all delicious food. After all, all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy!One night while Billy is driving home and his wife, um, distracts him, he hits an old gypsy woman who dies instantly. The case is quickly dismissed; after all, Billy is a lawyer and no one in town is exactly a fan of gypsies. Just as Billy gets out of the courthouse, the old gyp comes to Billy and touches his cheek, whispering the sole, menacing word - \"thinner\".Billy dismisses the old man as mad, and goes back to his life as if nothing had happened. Till he hits the scale. He notices that he starts losing weight - at first he, his wife and his physician are all happy and rejoice in the blissful success of all diets he undertook. But when the pounds keep dropping and Billy keeps eating he starts being suspicious. He's not afraid of cancer, because his results were perfect...he's afraid that the old gyp might have meant what he said.And the pounds keep dropping...The strenght of \"Thinner\" lies in its complexity. Most works deal with likable protagonists and unlikable villains. That's not the case with \"Thinner\" - it's up to the reader to decide whom he will root for. If there is a person to like - After all, Billy did kill the old gyspy woman; and after all, the old gypsy's revenge is much out of proportion. \"Thinner\" is not a simple horror story, as many would pigeonhole it; the clever meachnisms of characterization and themes allow \"Thinner\" to work on several levels: as a cautionary tale on the pointlesness of conflict and hatred, the clash of cultures, family drama, corruption...the story of the white man and the gyp who crossed him. Or is it the other way round? I don't want to spoilt any of the plot detail, because it's truly a jou to watch it unfold. The novel was adapted into a movie in 1996, and while it greatly simplifies the novel it carries most of the story thanks to great performances of Robert John Burke and Joe Mantegna-. It's definitely worth seeing, but only after you've read the book. \"Thinner\" is one of the great horrormeister's most underrated works and deserves to be much better known and appreciated. It will make you turn the page, it will make you think and question your decisions, I don't know if it will scare you but you'll certainly remember it long after turning the last page.

I find writing reviews for 3-star books almost tedious, and certainly not enjoyable. It's fun writing about books I love, and it's fun ripping to shreds books I hate. Books that warrant an average rating are just that \u2014 average. And I struggle with reviews of them. Never before has that been more true than in the case of Thinner, by Richard Bachman/Stephen King. That makes me a little sad, too \u2014 I've enjoyed writing every review in my Stephen King reread project thus far. Luckily, I definitely have some fun ones (Skeleton Crew, It, Misery) coming up soon.I think what made this reading experience a little different than, say, reading and reviewing Pet Sematary or The Shining is the fact that I'd never read Thinner before, despite having owned it for years. In fact, it was in the stack of my first King purchases \u2014 I bought them at an old, out of the way used bookstore in Decatur, Alabama. I think I bought Dreamcatcher and Different Seasons and The Running Man along with Thinner. The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon was probably in there, too. I tried reading each of those to little success \u2014 it wasn't until I read Christine a year later that I became the Stephen King fanboy I am today. So, yeah. I'd had a little experience with Thinner (I think I read the first chapter before giving up and never going back to it, until now), so I had no prior relationship with the story. I went into this thing like a virgin, baby. Did that impact my eventual rating of this book? Eh, maybe a little. But not much. Truth be told, no matter how many times I read this book in the future (and I suspect that number isn't too high) I feel it will never earn more than a solid three stars from me. It happens.So! What did I like and dislike about this one? Well . . . King wrote this one as Richard Bachman, so it's deliciously dark and full of sharp edges. That is a given. I dig that a lot. The ending is one of King/Bachman's best. Our protagonist, Billy Halleck, is a likable enough guy \u2014 albeit woefully underdeveloped on the whole (and that goes for every single character in this one). The story has little to no filler, which is another Bachman characteristic. Ginelli's plotting and revenge is fun to read, even if he's nothing more than a half-baked retread of Rainbird from Firestarter. The concept itself \u2014 an overweight guy rapidly losing weight \u2014 sounds lame, but in King's hands it works wonderfully. This guy can make haunted cars and soda machines believable and menacing, for chrissakes.Something that really disappointed me about this one is the missed opportunity for King to make some biting social commentary. C'mon \u2014 it's about an overweight, rich lawyer getting cursed to rapidly lose weight. The guy can no longer enjoy every American's two favorite things \u2014 food and sex. I went into this one expecting musings on and mockery of American greed, a'la Needful Things. I think King/Bachman tried doing that a bit here, but it gets lost in the mix. It's unfortunate. I love it when King gets in his Dickensian, full-on social commentator persona; it shouldn't be a surprise that the '90s is my favorite Stephen King decade, as far as his writing goes. Yeah, I'm one of those weird fans.This isn't a bad read. It's good for passing time, I suppose, but it's certainly not an essential entry in the King catalogue. If you're looking for a great Bachman novel, search out The Long Walk or Roadwork. Ironically enough, the Bachman novel that 'feels' the most like King (i.e. this one) is the one I like least. Weird. All in all, this is the epitome of an average read.King connections:Not many, as this is a Bachman novel. However, at one point a character describes what's going on with Billy as 'something out of a Stephen King novel.' Seriously, did he want his pseudonym to be found out? Favorite quote:\u201cSome guys-- a lot of guys---don't believe what they are seeing, especially if it gets in the way of what they eat or drink or think or believe. Me, I don't believe in God. But if I saw him, I would. I wouldn't just go around saying 'Jesus, that was a great special effect.' The definition of an asshole is a guy who doesn't believe what he's seeing. And you can quote me.\u201dUp next:I'm skipping The Talisman for now (I'll hook around and get it and Black House when I'm finished rereading everything else), so it's looking like Skeleton Crew. Yay! I love King's short stories.

The writing in Thinner was King\u2019s classic style with fantastic internal dialogue. The plot was interesting and the characters well-fleshed out. My main issue was that despite being a relatively short book, I felt it dragged at time, particularly in the middle. The ending was not bad but not great (typical King). Overall an enjoyable read but not as good as some of his other novels."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1376766-becky", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. It's dark and has a kind of bitterness, and I liked that quality a lot. But first, the thing that I thought didn't really work: Billy's starting weight of 246 lbs. Billy is 6'2, so while 246 lbs on that frame would make him overweight, it is by no means the \"pig fat\" obese weight that we're supposed to feel like it is. His doctor and his wife and daughter all have this \"Ohmigod, you will have a heart attack and DIE, Billy!\" panic about his weight, so when he starts losing it, they all but throw him a party celebrating his edging back from the ledge of Fat Induced Death. (Yet his wife then continues to make him heart-attack-on-a-plate meals... Go figure that one.)I know that back in the 70s and 80s, people were far more active and so a 246 lb man would be considered unhealthy and overweight - but even so, it just seems that the ratio of weight to height would make him heavyset rather than dangerously fat. This just bugged me. King does date himself a bit in the writing, since he writes about life as it is. So we see a lot of rich and very well-to-do people's large and well-appointed homes, in upscale communities with country clubs, in the $200,000 range. Now that would get you a small house somewhere, or a condo, but for the type of homes described here, we're looking in the million dollar range. We also see inflation in much more mundane style... Billy's order from McDonalds: 3 Big Macs, 2 large orders of fries, a large milkshake (coffee flavored! WHY don't they still have that?!), a cherry pie and a box of cookies. All for the grand total of $6.90. I haven't had anything other than breakfast food (MmmMm bacon, egg and cheese biscuit!) from Mickey D's in a long time, but I think the average combo of burger, medium fries and a drink would run about the same now. But that's not really a complaint, just an observation. I like that King gives us a sort of snapshot into the past in his writing. It's fascinating to me. Anyway, I really liked this one. I loved the characters, with maybe the exception of Linda, who I thought was just too... I dunno, perfectly daddy's girlish. Her effluence of emotion just grated on me a bit... but she's not in big chunks of this book, so it was OK. I thought Heidi was interesting and well fleshed out, even though I didn't really like her. But my stand-out favorites here were Billy himself, more for his downward spiral than who he was before, the small changed in the way he sees things, the anger and the bitterness. I loved all that and I couldn't help but empathize with him. Ginelli was my other favorite. I LOVED Ginelli. I wish that he had a bigger part in the book. I found him completely fascinating and ruthless and somehow honorable. He's definitely a guy I want on my side. I really liked how the Gypsies were depicted. I liked them a lot, actually. I haven't read a lot of books featuring Gypsy characters or their way of life or what-have-you. Not really my thing, but I didn't think that they were portrayed in a stereotypical way at all. The things that happened to them, and that they did and caused may have been - like the curse itself, and the townfolk running them out of town and the like - those I can see as being stereotypical, but I didn't really feel like that was the point here. I thought the point was that regardless of their different looks and ways and lifestyle, they are still people who deserve to be treated fairly, and who will eventually get fed up with only getting the short end of the stick because they are transients and \"unwanteds\". These Gypsies were US citizens, with social security numbers and birth certificates and the like, but they were treated as if they were no more than vermin. So when they needed the justice system and it failed them blatantly, things got ugly in the name of justice. Or revenge, perhaps, if you like that better. But I don't blame them in their desire for it. I really enjoyed this one. I would definitely recommend it if you haven't read it."}, {"userName": "Johann (jobis89)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50893023-johann-jobis89", "userReview": "\"In many ways the world is nothing but a pile of shit. But it can also be very beautiful.\"A relatively quick read, this book! Quite a fun and original idea for a book. I was excited to see where King would go with it.Thinner is a story about Billy Halleck who accidentally knocks down and kills a gypsy woman. Unfortunately, it gets much worse as he is left with a terrible curse set upon him by the deceased's father. A curse where he begins to lose a lot of weight and it shows no sign of slowing down...The first half of this book was SO GOOD. I was racing through pages like Billy races through donuts. I think the originality of the story was the reason for this, as well as just wanting to know more about what happens. However, I thought that it died down and stalled around the half-way mark, and kinda felt like it was starting to drag on slightly. But then the pace picked up again for the finale, which was absolutely brilliant. I loved the ending, I loved how it felt unpredictable to me personally.None of the characters stood out to me really, but clearly that wasn't necessary in order to enjoy the story. Like Billy, I did feel slightly resentful towards his wife, because she technically was also the cause of the fatal accident. I also just didn't really like the wife, in general, she was irritating at times.Overall, I thought Thinner was a fun, quick read that I definitely enjoyed more than my first Bachman book - The Running Man. I also loved how King cheekily made references to his own novels...you sly dog!

Era questo il vero Stephen King, il maestro della favola d'orrore capace di incupire anche il lettore pi\u00f9 scettico e tranquillo. \"L'occhio del male\" appartiene ai capolavori della sua prima fase, anche se resta, rispetto ad altri titoli come \"It\" e \"Shining\", meno conosciuto; vi si trovano comunque alcuni dei temi che l'autore svilupper\u00e0 nelle successive opere maggiori, dalla lotta fra il Bene e il Male al misticismo delle maledizioni che causano l'irrompere di un incubo nella placida routine di personaggi comuni. Qui, nello specifico, Billy, avvocato di successo, a causa di una distrazione investe e uccide una vecchia zingara e al processo ottiena l'assoluzione, ma il padre della defunta gli scaglier\u00e0 addosso una maledizione che finir\u00e0 per cambiare la sua vita e quella di chi gli sta attorno.In conclusione, una favola intrigante e maledetta della quale conservo un buon ricordo.

As such, this novel is more in the style of king than in the more raw style that I found in the other earlier Bachman books.Thinner is a great \"revenge\" novel. The story moves quickly and the main character's race against time keeps the pages turning at a fairly rapid pace. The nice thing about this one is that, in true King fashion, nobody is truly safe and almost everyone, in some way, truly deserves what they get in the end. I really did enjoy this one and, though it's not amongst King's very best, it's right there on the second tier. It's a fun book (and the movie follows the novel fairly accurately) that I'll most probably enjoy again someday."}], "description": "The fantasy of becoming trimmer\u2014and happier\u2014turns into a nightmare of unrelenting terror for Billy Halleck who is 50 pounds overweight, sideswipes an old gypsy woman, and receives the maledictive sentence to get \"thinner.\" What will he do when he can't stop losing weight?", "title": "Thinner", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/899053.Thinner", "average": 3.68, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1396299610l/899053.jpg", "reviews": 1850, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5858.Richard_Bachman", "name": "Richard Bachman"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3389.Stephen_King", "name": "Stephen King"}], "type": ["Horror", "Fiction", "Thriller", "Fantasy", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/899053.Thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/457052.Thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10605.Thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/233690.Thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7670883-thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15832779-thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28119720-thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29430674-thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2193235.Maleficio", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1052797.Thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1146026.Thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30623144-thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16108794", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10431637-thinner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10149386-l-occhio-del-male", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9014.The_Long_Walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11607.The_Running_Man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10617.The_Bachman_Books", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10596.The_Regulators", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/349473.Blaze", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
