It is the imposter. He is the stage effect.\u201d \u2014 Meyer to McGeeIt\u2019s early December as this unusual Travis McGee novel begins. Whereas most of the McGee novels have mystery and suspense laced with resonating observations about life and society, with MacDonald casting a cloud on the sunshine of Florida with his insightful pondering of the misled, this one has those observations and insights front and center, with the mystery and suspense the underscore. While it makes this an atypical Travis McGee novel in some ways, it does not make it a bad one. It is in fact, a very good read, with many worthwhile moments. It\u2019s not surprising that it\u2019s one of the books in the series that he dedicated to his wife, Dorothy.Coming just before the excellent Dreadful Lemon Sky, this was the first Travis McGee published in hardback, however, and just for a moment, perhaps less than a moment, MacDonald blinked. There is no way to give an accurate portrayal of a book so misrepresented at times without getting into great detail, so if you have a problem with basic plot spoilers for a book that\u2019s been around for almost fifty years, you might want to stop reading here. MacDonald was at heart a pulp writer \u2014 elevated so high most don\u2019t recognize it as such, but a pulp writer nonetheless. He realized his readers were paperback readers, and knowing this one would be marketed toward people who might not have read a Travis McGee before, you can almost feel him taking the pulp edges off McGee, softening his hero just a tad to make him a bit more vulnerable \u2014 and fallible. The basic plot of a likable, affable sociopath who fools both McGee and Meyer would be used again \u2014 and in a more resonating way \u2014 in MacDonald\u2019s next to last Travis McGee novel, Cinnamon Skin.Each entry in any great series has its own atmosphere and value, however, and Turquoise Lament stands alone quite nicely. While Cinnamon Skin is a near masterpiece, The Turquoise Lament is very, very good when you don\u2019t compare the two \u2014 or pit it against more stellar entries in the series. At MacDonald\u2019s level, it is a matter of mere degrees between good and memorable. We are, after all, talking about one of the greatest series in American fiction, lauded by one great noteworthy writer after another. Over two decades, Travis McGee became a household name because readers couldn\u2019t wait to get their hands on the next novel. This one is a solid four stars, as opposed to the solid five for Cinnamon Skin. That is all.It begins in lovely Hawaii during early December. With great economy MacDonald places us there, and we\u2019re soon hip to why taxi fares are so outrageous in Honolulu. McGee has made the trip from Florida at the request of Pidge Brindle, and the Travis McGee devotee can already sense this one is going to be a bit different from the others. McGee remembers how lovely Pidge was at seventeen, stowing aboard his boat to offer herself to him. Not the lech some over the years have misleadingly portrayed MacDonald\u2019s hero as, McGee of course emphatically declines, taking Pidge back to her father, Ted. MacDonald, however, understood the wistfulness of what might have been, that twinge of regret every man feels at perhaps passing up something wonderful \u2014 even when it\u2019s the right thing to do. There is nothing harder to resist than someone completely in love with you. Pidge is definitely no longer seventeen, however, and she is just as lovely. She\u2019s also a mess. Whether the mess is real, or imagined, is for McGee to figure out.A year ago, Pidge married Howie Brindle, a big, uncomplicated and easygoing giant who may not be the brightest bulb in the cupboard, but works hard and is very likable. Pidge\u2019s almost neurotic story doesn\u2019t jibe with anything he knows about Howie. Nor does it jibe with the evidence, which includes photographs. Though McGee cares about her, he needs to get the lay of the land, to discover if something diabolical is going on, or whether Pidge is having issues. So he talks to Howie and gets his version. With readers\u2019 sympathy firmly in Pidge\u2019s court, in a brilliantly written scene, we meet Howie, and begin to have the same doubts as McGee:\u201cHe let go and spun away. His voice had broken. He started walking slowly back out the jetty toward the Trepid. It was a listless and dejected walk. A big dumpy giant, sad in the Christmas-coming sunshine.\u201d \u2014 McGee describing the heartbroken and confused Howie.But if Howie isn\u2019t trying to kill Pidge, and there wasn\u2019t another woman hiding on the boat while they were at sea \u2014 and all evidence suggests he isn\u2019t, and there wasn\u2019t \u2014 what\u2019s going on with Pidge? Is she cracking up? So McGee drinks and talks to her, and they drink and talk some more, until finally, Pidge breaks down. Everything is psychologically sound in what transpires next. McGee doesn\u2019t plant ideas, it is Pidge who realizes she doesn\u2019t love Howie, no matter how much she wants to, and she\u2019s created this elaborate ruse to explain why. This of course leads to an intimacy not planned by McGee, but firmly orchestrated by Pidge. As she tells McGee, explaining how it took her three hours to work up courage for her planned seduction: \u201cYou never had a chance, McGee.\u201d And she\u2019s right. It\u2019s impossible for McGee to turn her down now, and there\u2019s really no reason to:\u201cThat and other memories of her were strangely merged with the sweet and immediate realities of her, the here-and-nowness of her, so that I seemed to live in the past and the present all at once. \u2014 She was a temptation out of the past, served up on some kind of eternal lazy Susan so that it had come by once again, and this time we had taken it.\u201dLater, Pidge explains:\u201cIt\u2019s too scary. I can\u2019t go through all that again. Not ever. So there\u2019s just one thing that would keep me from going back to him. And we just finished that one thing, and it was really beautiful. I wanted to do it with you a thousand years ago and you wouldn\u2019t. You were pretty stuffy about it.\u201dSomewhere along the way, however, what might have been becomes what is:\u201cThere may be better ways of spending the middle part of a Friday in Hawaii or anywhere else. If so, I find it very hard to think of any. It made a fine Friday. And Saturday. And Sunday.\u201d \u2014 McGee in his thoughtsMuch later, after Meyer collapses and is in the hospital, and after a couple of suicides by lonely friends, McGee ponders his future:\u201cWould I, Travis McGee, bring thee, Linda Lewellen Brindle, aboard this houseboat to live herein and hereon, with me, happily, so long as we shall all remain afloat?\u201dBut before Meyer makes McGee think long and hard about his own mortality, McGee has to tell Howie that Pidge doesn\u2019t want to be with him:\u201cHe looked down. I thought it was a snort of sour laughter, and then realized it was a sob. I saw tears run down his round ruddy cheek. I felt like a coconspirator in a very rotten plan. This was a very simple decent guy. So like a coward, I tiptoed offstage.\u201dFor a while, McGee goes through women, trying to shake off Pidge, but he can\u2019t. Soon McGee realizes that he loves Pidge, then he gets her letter. Here is MacDonald the writer at his absolute best. Written from Pidge\u2019s viewpoint, he perfectly captures her female voice, her thoughts and feelings, her excitement about the future she plans with McGee. It goes on for four pages, and will ring absolutely true to any man who has ever received a love letter. It\u2019s a terrific piece of writing that offsets a later pretentious flourish when MacDonald has McGee interrogate himself during a mock trial. Also offsetting it is an insightful rumination on modern arrogance in regard to ancient civilizations. The mock trial in McGee's head is just a minor blip on the radar.It\u2019s Meyer who, when he begins recovering, realizes exactly what McGee's running from, and points him in the right direction. As McGee finally admits to his best friend, and one of the great sidekicks in mystery fiction:\u201cI keep thinking that other people have friends, and they talk about ball games and the weather and laugh a lot. What have I got? Ann Landers.\u201dSounds like a great romance, doesn\u2019t it? Well, finally we get to the Travis McGee part of the novel with which we\u2019re more familiar. There is sunken treasure, and a lot of money left to Pidge by her father, Ted. There\u2019s a guy named Collier, some blackmail, and Pidge somewhere out there on the big blue ocean with Howie Brindle, making one last trip to sell a boat before she returns to be McGee\u2019s love. Then McGee has noticed something off in the photos that he needs to have an expert look at. It gives McGee a chill when he realizes he\u2019s read it all wrong. This is the one where McGee almost buries someone alive. But mostly he just backtracks Howie, which reveals a very startling picture:\u201cRemember, there is a very cold and strange entity that hides inside Howie Brindle. It is the imposter. He is the stage effect.\u201d \u2014 \u201cAn almost casual impulse. Irritation plus opportunity plus slyness, plus a total absence of human warmth and feeling.\u201d \u2014 MeyerIt is also Meyer's belief that Pidge can stay alive longer at sea because of what transpired in Honolulu; simply because she believes she imagined it all the first time out, and Howie will not feel the impulse quite so quickly. With no hope of finding her on the water \u2014 MacDonald makes it startlingly clear just how difficult it is to locate a boat on the open sea \u2014 all McGee can do is wait for the boat in American Samoa. It gives McGee a chance to make observations about that part of the world which ring very true. What finally transpires is violent and exciting, and leads to a true reversal of roles, and a bittersweet ending. The mystery and suspense is the underscore here, the soft strings rather than the driving horns. Had a reader never picked up a McGee book, this would seem marvelous. Having read them all many times over the decades, it\u2019s only a good, solid entry where McGee was written a bit softer, the broad shoulders rounded in McGee\u2019s version of a mid-life crisis. A great ending makes up for a lot, but this one is best enjoyed by those who love the ongoing commentary about society and the observations about living, and humanity. A book certainly misunderstood and sometimes misrepresented. A solid four stars as a McGee novel.\u201cThe blackness was there in Howie Brindle, and then it was gone.\u201d \u2014 McGee"}, {"userName": "Kemper", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/405390-kemper", "userReview": "(This is one of those books that\u2019s a little tricky to review because I have to give up a fair amount of plot to discuss what I found so ridiculous about it, but it's all part of the basic set-up. If you know that you\u2019re reading a crime novel and/or are familiar with Travis McGee it\u2019s pretty obvious how things will play out. Plus, I\u2019m not giving up anything about the ending so I\u2019m not going to spoiler tag the whole review, but if you haven\u2019t read and you don\u2019t want to know too much, you should probably skip this one.)The old Sea Cock really outdid himself this time\u2026.When Pidge Llewellen was a teenage girl she had a huge crush on Travis McGee and her treasure hunting father once saved his life so he feels more than a little protective of her. After her father was killed in an accident, McGee and his friend Meyer made sure she received the sizable inheritance she was owed as well as vetted her prospective husband Howie Brindle. After their wedding Pidge and Howie set off on a cruise around the world in a small boat.Months later Travis gets a call from Pidge in Hawaii asking for help. When he arrives Pidge tells him that either she\u2019s crazy or Howie is trying to kill her. She claims several weird incidents happened at sea, but when Travis talks to Howie the big friendly lug is hurt and confused at his wife\u2019s claims and behavior.Convinced that the man is telling the truth, McGee gets Pidge drunk and to admit that she doesn't love Howie. Travis assures her that all the odd stuff was just her poor little female mind being unable to cope at failing when she picked a mate. Reassured, Pidge bangs McGee for a couple of days to prove his theory right. She then tells Howie that they\u2019ll need to split, but he convinces her to sail the boat to meet a buyer at Poga Poga before they call a divorce lawyer.Satisfied at his efforts as a marriage counselor and psychologist, McGee returns to Florida where he immediately begins nailing even more women than usual. Whatever could have driven him to this state? Examining his own heart, McGee finds that he has fallen in love with Pidge, and coincidently he gets a letter from her proclaiming her own love and saying that they\u2019ll start a life of bliss together right after she gets done with this risky ocean voyage alone with the husband she recently informed of her wish to divorce and that she once thought might be trying to kill her\u2026..At first, McGee is ecstatic, but then he belatedly figures out that Howie is a total sociopath involved with a complicated scheme regarding Pidge\u2019s inheritance. With no way to reach Pidge, all McGee can do is investigate Howie\u2019s past and be waiting to see if Pidge is still alive when the boat reaches Poga Poga.This could have been a great story, maybe even a turning point in the series if it had played up the angle of how badly McGee botched this and left a woman he cares for at the mercy of a killer. Heroes are interesting when they make mistakes and having the star of a series like this completely fail and try to atone for it should make for an entertaining book.The problem here is that MacDonald makes McGee such a goddamn know-it-all. The off-topic monologues that Travis indulges in are usually one of the charms of the series for me when he was reflecting on life in an increasingly homogenized and corporatized America. However, in this one it seems like ole Trav knows best about everything from boat maintenance to hotel management to the safety records of cable cars. Since his work involves mixing it up with various kinds of shady people, he also frequently points out all the ways that the simple sheep of the world get slaughtered by the wolves and how he\u2019s much too cautious and smart to fall for any of those tricks.So he looks pretty damn ridiculous because he never once seems to consider the idea that he gave his blessing to a young man he knew little about so that he could marry a wealthy young lady and then sail away with her. After Pidge tells him she\u2019s worried about being murdered including one incident where the husband admitted that he fired a gun in her direction, McGee is so certain that he\u2019s diagnosed and treated (with sex) Pidge\u2019s problem that it never even crosses his mind that Howie might be a bad guy. Even if you believed that there was no possibility that Pidge had been in danger before, it seems odd that McGee doesn\u2019t show the slightest concern that she\u2019d be alone for weeks at sea with the husband she's leaving. I mean, what the shit? I would expect a cynical student of nature to maybe think that putting a couple with a pending divorce alone in a goddamn boat in the middle of the goddamn ocean wouldn\u2019t be a great idea under the best of circumstances, let alone when either the husband has tried to kill her already or the cheese has slipped off her cracker\u2026.McGee has had some pretty severe character defects through the course of this series, but this is the first time I just thought he was a complete moron from page one."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"A bore is a man who deprives you of solitude without providing you with company.\"- Gian Vincenzo Gravina, quoted in Turquoise LamentIt wound-up really well, but puttered a bit at the middle, and was predictable at the end. I think my misgivings about this book were structural (no major sexism, racism, or homophobia in this book). It had several fantastic quotes and asides and the treasure hunter/gold digger parallel could really have been magic. In the end, however, the girl-in-peril scenario just didn't really work. She was obnoxious and the whole routine of the chase and rescue was like an over-long aerial tram cable: it begins to sag in the middle.I've been reading Ian Fleming's Bond series around the same time as MacDonald's McGee novels and I love and hate both series.

I'm sure treasure-hunting is incredibly difficult work, but I don't want to read a for Dummies edition of how it's done. This was all to lead up to how the treasure-hunter saves McGee's life, but I found the whole incident anticlimactic and rather amusing.Next lament: Mr. McDonald, when McGee falls in love for real, couldn't you have shown us how she's different from the hundreds of short-term encounters he's had?Last lament-NOT McDonald's fault.

There's not really any \"recovery\" in this story--MacDonald has clearly moved beyond the transactionality of the traditional PI novel. TURQUOISE is also light on the fisticuffs, and instead offers insights into relationships and psychology, including of the sociopathic kind. We get a good dollop of melancholy about getting older and youthful opportunities unrealized, thanks to the return of a young woman's from Trav's past. Of course women rarely enter a Travis McGee novel without having trouble in tow, and Pidge Llewellyn's troubles pull McGee to Hawaii and Pago Pago, while along the way MacDonald gets to share information on recondite areas of interest, including estate law and the onerousness of maintaining a private yacht. Some readers lament all the \"digressions,\" but to my mind MacDonald is a storyteller almost without peer in the crime section of the bookshop--only Westlake, and Block and Leonard when they're really on top of their game, are playing in the same league.Plus, you get prose like this:\"He is a very careful, fussy pilot. They are the best kind. It was such a nice morning he took it right across the peninsula and emerged a little north of Fort Myers. Once over the Gulf, he took it down to a thousand feet and stayed a half mile off the beaches as we went up the coast. Even looking toward the morning brightness, I had a good view of the coast. I hadn\u2019t seen it from that altitude for several years. Boca Grande looked much the same. And so did Manasota Key. But the small city of Venice, and Siesta Key, two keys north of Venice, were shocking. Pale and remarkably ugly high-rises were jammed against the small strip of sand beach, shoulder to shoulder. Blooms of effluent were murking the blue waters. Tiny churchgoing automobiles were stacked up at the lift bridges, winking in the sun, and making a whiskey haze that spoiled the quality of the light.\"SPOLIER ALERT:Clearly I have read too many Fleming 007 novels: when MacDonald described a gondola tram in great detail about 2/3rds of the way through the novel, I new exactly where the story's climax would take place."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim", "userReview": "Travis McGee is so perfect, like all those 1960s heroes who are chipped from bronze, who have beautiful women buzzing around their heads like flies, and whose wallets are always filled with the wherewithal to go at a moment's notice to far and exotic places.

God knows I was born with a \"go thither\" look as far as lissome models are concerned; and money flees from me like a mouse from an owl. The Turquoise Lament is probably a good read if you're still under that old 1960s black magic. Maybe I'm getting too old for formulaic wish fulfillment novels.

Again, great names for some of the characters - Pidge and Howie. Travis is a great character and certainly, on the surface, seems to live a life dreamed by most men. John D MacDonald (1916-1986) . Interestingly. Travis ponders and makes fairly stark warnings on oceanic pollution in this book - ahead of the times? Prone to a bit of down home philsophy, my favourite quote from the book -\"Integrity is not a conditional word. It doesn't blow in the wind or change with the weather. It is your inner image of yourself, and if you look in there and see a man who won't cheat, then you know he never will.\" MacDonald's style seems to me to be sparse and quick paced which helps to move the intricate plots forward with a momentum that just grabs the reader.

"userReview": "THE TURQUOISE LAMENT. (1973). John D. MacDonald. ***.This episode from the trials of Travis McGee presents us with a side of Travis that doesn\u2019t show him off well. He\u2019s too interested in chasing and bedding a variety of women to keep his eye on the ball. The daughter of an old friend of his calls Travis and asks for his help. She believes that her husband is trying to kill her. Travis goes to her, but rather than addressing the issue, he manages to fall in love with her. This does not preclude his affair with a nurse who is taking care of his old friend, Meyer, in the hospital. He certainly keeps busy. What suffers is the plot; it goes everywhere but forward. I\u2019d have to rate this as one of my least favorite McGee books. There\u2019s a side to McGee that we didn\u2019t see before, and doesn\u2019t add much to his reputation. According to the jacket flap, this is the first McGee adventure to have been published in hardback.

(p. 16)It is so damned trite to say that they don't build them like that any more. They can still build them, if there's anybody left with money like that. The anticipated pleasure slowly faded and died. I did not enjoy looking at the Trepid. Let me explain about a boat person, one like me who is always a step behind or a step and a had behind the normal maintenance chores aboard The Busted Flush. The Trepid was sound and good, and she would have looked just great to a civilian.\tHer lines are quite a lot like the forty-six-foot Rhodes Fiberglass Motorsailor, vintage 1972, but the Trepid has ten feet more length, six feet more beam, and in spite of a dead-weight tonnage nearly twice that of the Rhodes, actually draws a little less when that big beefy centerboard is wound all the way up into its slot in the hull. She is a husky boat, built like a workboat, and if you want to use a small jib like a staysail and go on diesels, she can give you almost three thousand miles at eight or nine knots, depending on the condition of her hull at the time.\tWhat I saw was dry, corroding running gear and blocks which looked as if they might be frozen by corrosion. I saw pitted metal, flaking paint, smudges and stains, milky cracking varnish, oily spots on the teak deck, and a spicily green on the sail cover which could be the beginning of a fatal case of mildew. Everywhere I looked I saw hundreds of hours of undone labor, and every dull labor it is. The sea has no mercy, and there is no such thing as \"maintenance-free.\" All you get near the water is either more maintenance than you can handle, or so much that you can just about stay ahead of it. The fee I pay for living aboard the Flush is a minimum of two hours a day of exterior housework every day I am aboard. (p. 29-30)\tThe sharks were cruising their range, as is their habit. They would come upon us, put on the brakes, turn and make a big circle, watching us all the while, and then take off again. No wild creature, except perhaps the cockroach, is an experimental gourmet. Unless the food supply has disappeared, wild things want to eat what they have always eaten. Something that does not look, sound, or move like anything that has ever been on their menu is not about to be tasted. It might taste incredibly nasty. Why take the risk? (p. 35-36)\tI could not understand why I felt so very damned good and said so. It was a different kind of good feeling from that which I get when I am in good shape. I wondered aloud.\t\"Heart,\" Professor Ted said, and then explained that a man's heart shares to a certain extent that trait of the whale heart and the porpoise heart of slowing down when they dive deeply, to give a maximum use of the oxygen in the blood, to make it last. \"You develop a bigger, slower beat, Travis, so that topside you're getting more nourishment to the cells of muscles and brain and gut.\" (p. 38)\tThere are men whose passports should be stamped NOT VALID OUTSIDE THE CONTINENTAL LIMITS OF THE USA. The further they get from home, the louder, cheaper, and tougher they get. And the more careless. They rove the world in honky style. (p. 41)It is a truly fantastic experience to watch what happens to iron after it has been in the sea for a few hundred years. When the air first hits it, the iron is chunky and solid. As it dries, the rusting process is so weirdly speeded up it is as though some terrible acid were working on the objects. They turned to flakes and powder, the into piles of dark dust in just the gentle motion of the Trepid. (p. 46)\t\"You can walk down ten thousand crowded streets in ten thousand cities of the world, and nobody will give damn one about whether you cope or can't cope, whether you live or die. The ones who notice you wonder if there's any safe way to use you, or they give you a parrot in the little fantasy theater inside their skulls. There is an estimated price on your clothes, shoes and purse, but the rest of you is just so much live meat. Pretty meat. No bonus for how well you perform the feat of living.\" (p. 82)I said I would be on tenterhooks until she gave me the word. She had always wondered what was a tenterhook. I told her that a tenter was a frame on which they used to stretch cloth when they made it, so it would dry evenly, and the bent nails around the frame were tenterhooks. (p. 90)\tUnreality was compounded this year by a long stretch of unseasonably torrid weather, comingling sweat and jingle bells. And all the merchants and hotel managers and saloonkeepers immediately violated all the rules of business management by turning on all the giant compressors and pulling the interior temperatures down into the 65- to 68-degree range, never realizing they are the unknowing victims of a long-term conspiracy.\tWhen a new structure is built, the air-conditioning experts are encouraged by the architect and the builder to overspecify the project. If they specify an $80,000 system instead of a $40,000 system, the architect and the contractor each, in most cases, pocket an extra $4000. Trade periodicals harp on how customer traffic flow is increased by keeping the thermostat low. In the densely urban areas, the heat output of all the overspecified systems so raises the ambient temperature that the big compressors have to kick in more often to keep the store at 67 degrees.\tThe knowledgeable general practitioner and the specialist in respiratory diseases will both tell you that it is a total idiocy to subject the human animal to abrupt temperature variations of more than 15 degrees. He gets sick. He has more virus infections. He takes more time off from work. He feels rotten. (p. 92-93)And there was a lot of getting in and out of boats, in and out of pools, and in a daze of booze and indifference, getting in and out of beds, even though I had long since discovered that it is a habit which degrades the receptivity to sensation, coarsens selectivity, implies obligation, and turns of most useful introspection. (p. 94)So the hospital was fine. It was a project. Infiltrate. Ingratiate. Learn the kind of protective coloring that gets you past the places where they stop civilians, and learn the kind of behavior which keeps the staff from using their authority to toss you the hell out. (p. 97)I watched her. An alert, heads-up pace, little white cap, teacup size with blue edging, riding squarely atop the clenched blonde curls, white shoes with rubber ripple soles, toeing in, the long stride swinging the hips. It was a difficult, almost impossible feat to relate that brisk professional image to the night creature of the rollaway mattress, so quickly sensitized that she jerked, flexed, gasped at each caress until, in response to the body language of tugging and reaching, I had rolled her under.\tAnd now I could not conceive of ever wanting to take her one more time. And suspected that she too would like to avoid a rerun. This is one of the new relationships in a transient society for which there is no word or phrase in common use. Marian and I were not friends, because friendship grows out of mutual concerns and out of being together at many times in many places. We were not lovers, because there was little or no continuity of desire. We were not completely casual libertines, dissolute and uncontrolled. Each of us had fed a great many bits into our personal computers, at breakneck speed. Is he-she physically attractive to me? Is he-she clean and healthy? Will he-she be circumspect and private about it? Is he-she seeking some kind of angle or advantage I don't know about? Is he-she likely to be kinky in some kind of vulgar, unpleasant or even alarming way? Could he-she be hunting some kind of long-range emotional security and personal involvement I can't afford? Are there so many shadow areas in the computer response to the questions that the anticipated pleasure is not worth the unknown risk?\tFor each of us the equation worked, but there was the element of risk, the element of the unknown that honed the edge of anticipated pleasure. So it was too tense to be entirely casual.\tThe Great Magician had called us up from the audience. He had wanted a man and a woman. Marian and I had come from opposite sides of the packed theater, accepting the risk of volunteering, and had been locked together in the magic box by the Magician, feeling vibrant and short of breath. The trick had worked. We had disappeared completely and had materialized back in the real world, no better and no worse for the experience. We had fattened our memory banks with information which might be of use someday. And in a mortal world, in the midst of all the dying, we had once again proven we were desirable, trustworthy and sexually competent.\tAcquaintances perhaps? The encounter, though brief, struck too deep for that shallow word. Conspirators? There is no word for the relationship. It is a small, delicious and important risk which is being taken an uncountable number of times a day -- two-person encounter groups making initial contact in the office, plant, supermarket, waiting room, banquet hall, country club, bus station, cocktail bar. Eye contact, speculation, appraisal. Run all the accessible data through the memory banks of experience and, after an hour, a week, or a month, set up the assignation. The more discriminating and fastidious the risk-taker, the rarer will be the taking of risk\u2026.\tIf it is a bad risk and there is just a small loss, it becomes a dreary episode, with petulance, regret and ugly words. The risk seems to turn bad when one of the players finds the partner is a compulsive player, a prowler, a collector of souvenirs of the hunt, a scorekeeper.\tOurs had been an unexceptional event. Quite pleasant, leaving a residue of a mild and patronizing fondness. Good girl, there. Jolly good show, and all that. Nobody was a hunter. The contact had been accidental, the vibrations acceptable, the conclusion foregone. (p. 110-112)\"Illness is an ego trip, especially after you begin to feel better. You turn inward. How do I feel right now compared to five minutes ago, an hour ago, yesterday? Is this pain in my hip connected with the infection? Is it something new? Why can't they come when I ring? All intensely personal. Petulant. To each of us, the self is the most enchanting object in all creation. Sickness intensifies the preoccupation with self. And, of course, the true bore, the classic bore, is the person who is as totally preoccupied with himself all the time as the rest of us are when we are unwell.\" (p. 179, Meyer)\"There is something childlike about him. A kind of placidity, a willingness to be moved about by events. You sense that he does not want to be an aggressor, to take anything you have from you by force. He is cheerful, without being at all witty. He loves to play games. He likes to be helpful. He watches a lot of daytime television. He has a short attention span. He won't dream up chores, but he'll do faithfully what you tell him to do, if you're explicit. His serious conversation, a rare phenomenon, seems to come from daytime television drama. He loves chocolate bars and beer. He doesn't want trouble of any kind, and he'll lie beautifully to get out of any kind of trouble. He has absolutely no interest in the world at large. Retarded? Hardly. I think he may have ha better intelligence than he is willing to display. But something is wrong with him. For lack of a better word, call him a sociopath. They are very likable, plausible people. They make superb imposters, until they lose interest in the game of the moment. They form few lasting attachments. As a rule, they are liars, petty thieves, sometimes brawlers, but seldom are killers. I can explain why they are so dangerous, the ones willing to kill. Because they are absolutely immune to polygraph tests. The polygraph measures fear, guilt, shame, anxiety. They don't experience these emotions. They can fake them by imitating the way the rest of us act under stress. But it's only an imitation. When the only thing in the world that concerns you is not getting caught, you would kill for very small reasons. In fact, murder that is the result of irritation plus casual impulse plus an elementary slyness is the most difficult to solve.\" (p. 183-184, Meyer on Howard Brindle)\t\"Remember, there is a very cold and strange entity that hides inside Howie Brindle. It is the imposter. He is the stage effect. It has refined the role until good ol' Howie knows all the tricks of quick acceptance, of generating fondness, of making people glad to help him out. The thing inside pulls the strings and pushes the little levers, and Howie does all your chores for you. Cheerfully.\" (p. 185)Integrity is not a conditional word. It doesn't blow in the wind or change with the weather. It is your inner image of yourself, and if you look in there and see a man who won't cheat, then you know he never will. Integrity is not a search for the rewards for integrity. Maybe all you ever get for it is the largest kick in the ass the world can provide. It is not supposed to be a productive asset. Crime pays a lot better. I can bend my own rules way, way over, but there is a place where I finally stop bending them. I can recognize the feeling. I've been there a lot of times. (p. 218)All creatures seem to seek comfort in routine. The cows bawl at first light for the milker\u2026. The cat comes to the kitchen at five, sits to wash, knowing it is time for supper\u2026.\tWe put on the same shoe first every time and take of the same one first every time, and feeling obscurely uneasy when we vary our dumb little pattern. We start the shave at the same place every time, put on a hat at the angle that feels right because it feels like all the other times.\tPatterns hold us in place, give us identity. And patterns are a kind of freedom, because if all the little motions of life vary each time, they require thought. When the memories are imprinted in the fibers of the nerves and muscles, the shoes are on, the face shaved, the belt latched, with no conscious awareness of how it happened.

MacDonald. This book was originally published in 1973, 9 years after the series begins with a Depp Blue Goodbye.Travis McGee novels, and probably John D. MacDonald overall but I would not know, are a read not for everyone. The novels are a product of their times. McGee is an ethical playboy, I suppose. He sleeps around a lot but is painted as the rogue with a heart quite different from the books antagonists who are rogues without a heart. One person I was discussing the books with labelled McGee as a \u201cserial monogamist\u201d. I thought about it and had to agree.But this is a book review, not a book report, so let me get to the meat of things. I avoid spoilers in my reviews. You are supposed to be enticed to read, not discouraged from bothering. And I primarily critique what is for the me the three most crucial elements of a (fiction) book: the plot, the characters, and the overall writing style.Travis McGee novels have one plot. McGee, as favor or on contract, is delving into some squalid affair that has deprived his friend or client what is rightfully theirs. In the midst of recovering, or \u201csalvaging\u201d, This is of course a gross generalization, but is nevertheless always true. In this one we find McGee traveling to Hawaii and American Samoa. The plot carries the story, which as much as I ask. On a scale of 5, the story gets a 3.The characters are a win and a loss for me. By now I know Travis McGee. His bad habits and persistent ability to make at least one giant foolish mistake per book infuriates me. One could strike it up to bad characterization, but I don\u2019t I\u2019ve developed an interest in the man over time. It would be very jaded to mark that down as a negative point. In the last few books we are more consistently seeing his best friend Meyers a great deal more. This is a good thing. Save for one or two other characters in each book, the rest of the characters serve their purpose. MacDonald can use a few sentences to make a person feel real and not just a place holder in the story. I\u2019ve read several other authors who couldn\u2019t do the same with their primary characters over the course of 300 pages or so. So for characters I give 4 stars.1973 was only 45 years ago. I was in grade school. Rock and roll had taken over the world and the prize the conquerors most longed for was women and drugs. It\u2019s hard to explain, but this book, as others in the series, both sets women in their place as meek flowers needing a man to take care of them and lifts them with existential prose, all from the mind of one Travis McGee. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about it. Before I found the writing refreshing, but having read so many now, it can tire me. I give the writing style for this one a 3.I caught a couple one silly errors in this book. They weren\u2019t horribly important but they stood out as I consider MacDonald usually a pretty tight writer. At least enough to fool me. In one place he quotes an Italian and calls it a Spanish quote. I found the quote interesting so I looked it up. The other error was mine. I thought he had the time zones wrong from Hawaii to Florida. But I looked it up and I was wrong.Overall I give the book 3 of 5 stars. I am a cruel critic. But I do recommend the book to people who have interest in sailing. Or who have interest in late history of the Tampa area or who would like a peek at Hawaii or American Samoa during the time. Mostly I recommend Travis McGee to people who want to watch an interesting character move from book to book over a long-ish period of time. Flaws and all, McGee is one of my favorite characters from literature."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21114490-john", "userReview": "Travis McGee is one of my all time favorites. He always knows what makes the other guy tick, he is always one step ahead of the villain, and he ALWAYS gets the girl. I was a bit disappointed at old Trav when he suddenly falls head over heels for a young lady who he hasn't known since she was a girl. Suddenly he wants to settle down and be all domestic? This was very un-McGee and after traversing the globe to rescue his girl, she just gets written away (thank goodness) but in a way that signaled \"this was a bad idea and I have to get the book to publishing, so out she goes.\" I cared little for Travis's whining and reliance on Meyer to 1) solve his mysteries 2) kick some life into him.

OK. First, read every Travis McGee novel by John D. Then write a million words of crap (unfortunately, your first million words likely won\u2019t have much value). After that, yes, you will be a Contender.THE TURQUOISE LAMENT \u00a91973 \u2013 The plot here verges into the experimental, as John D. by this time was \u201cBig Enough\u201d as a successful writer to write any damn thing he pleased, exactly as he pleased; like Heinlein after STRANGER IN A STRANGE LAND. But John D. was always far more disciplined. Heinlein novels after STRANGER seem bloated to me. John D. was always tight and relevant, even here in TURQUOISE when he uses several pages to have Trav argue with himself, as if in court, \u201cALL RISE! Travis Versus Travis. The Honorable\u2026\u201d Confession: I have a serious bias; possibly many flaws of judgment. I believe that Jane Austen created the format for The Modern Novel when she wrote PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, the format which we all read today in 2013 [And please, will someone explain to me why we didn\u2019t go straight from 2012 to 2014\u2014need I mention Apollo 13, or Every Building Everywhere which refuses to recognize the 13th floor? Airplanes have no seat 13. Oh, no: it\u2019s the 113th Congress\u2026]. Obviously, Jane did not believe any such thing about her own awesome creative originality, because *ALL* her later novels conform to the styles of her day (where passive narration was \u201cthe thing\u201d); possibly British critics crushed, Crushed, CRUSHED her playful excessive use of dialogue.The literary character of Travis McGee was hatched in the Sixties while Hef was expounding on the Playboy Philosophy. Trav is a \u201cbad guy\u201d by 2013, excuse me, 2014 standards of PC. Also, don\u2019t try to read TURQUOISE while stoned, it is tricky and complicated; something of a tour de force at presenting Travis McGee as an ineffectual wimp. In TURQUOISE Travis is outsmarted, outmaneuvered, outfought, and kicked to the curb. John D. seems to be working overtime to make his hero look bad. Trav\u2019s most competent moment in TURQUOISE LAMENT is when he buries a man alive to obtain information, making him appear as evil as any antagonist; his anger so intense Trav nearly actually kills the man. The half-win at the end is just another trick of fate; Travis just a battered bystander.\u201cOops, mister.\u201d@hg47"}], "description": "\"One of the most enduring and unusual heroes in detective fiction.\"THE BALTIMORE SUNNow that Linda \"Pidge\" Lewellen is grown up, she tells Travis McGee, once her girlhood idol, that either she's going crazy or Howie, her affable ex-jock of a husband is trying to kill her.
