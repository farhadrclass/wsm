Arcadia Publishing has a wondrous selection of regional/national/iconic/Americana books bringing history alive through fascinating photo-essays, typically written and compiled by dedicated members of Historical Societies across America. I thoroughly enjoy reading them. It's like perusing the halls and archives of regional/national archives - finding interesting tidbits about key founding fathers/mothers, industries that have come and gone, \"then and now\" photos of land and cityscapes, little known bits of cultural history - but far more convenient and efficient for armchair history fans like myself. Around Mt. Helix is an overview history compilation of the towns and unincorporated areas around one of two iconic mountains in San Diego's east county: El Cajon, La Mesa, Lemon Grove, Spring Valley, Rancho San Diego. The mountaintop itself is known for its nature park, amphitheater, Easter Sunrise services, and iconic cross. Citrus and avocado groves, water flumes, an artist colony, entertainment legend endorsers, unique architecture hillside, nature trails, and Native American lore, this area has had a fascinating past and a colorful, culture rich presence. This particular book wasn't the most adeptly edited. Miniscule print didn't help, either. But the text was interesting, never dull or plodding. And the photos/illustrations were of excellent quality. I just wished there had been room to include more, as the author mentioned. Still though, a fun look back at the region (San Diego County) I currently call home. THREE *** Regionally Enlightening and Fascinating, History in Photo-Essay Form *** STARS"}], "description": "Every year, the morning of Easter Sunday, thousands of intrepid souls trek to the summit of San Diego County's Mt. Helix. Once there, they experience the nearly century-old tradition of a community-based sunrise service held at the historic Mt. Helix Nature Theater. Constructed for that purpose in 1925, and located in a unique, privately-owned \"public\" park, the landmark serves as just one of the reasons this conically shaped peak has become a regional, cultural, and natural icon. Named for a rare gastropod, the 1,119-foot-high pinnacle also serves as a geographic beacon for the mostly unincorporated surrounding communities of Mt. Helix, Grossmont, Calavo Gardens, Casa de Oro, Spring Valley, and the adjacent, historically related municipalities of El Cajon, Lemon Grove, and La Mesa. Today, these semirural communities are renowned for their idyllic, family-friendly neighborhoods; classic early-20th-century Revival-style and custom midcentury Modern architecture; and long-standing commercial and civic institutions.", "title": "Around Mt.
