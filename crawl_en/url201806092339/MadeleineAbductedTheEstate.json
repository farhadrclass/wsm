But sometimes he has to succumb to the darkness that wants to take him over in order to survive.A story about the struggle between good and evil, but sometime the both forces live inside us. A mans struggle to stay good. And a woman, once weak strengthened by her weakness.\nFinal Thoughts\nThis book was deliciously dark, the author was bold and did not shy away from a subject we might find too dark. The characters were lewd, depraved and blood thirsty, but because of that the story was easy to believe. The ending wasn't pretty, no pink bows here to make your heart flutter, it was dark it was gritty and it suited the entire story. This one is definitely for the dark romance lovers, the hero is not glossed over, he is a man who is flawed. I liked the heroine, she found strength in surrender and did it with dignity! Kicking and screaming isn't always the smartest thing to do, although we'd love to think so.I approve :)ARC kindly provided by author in return for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Lady Vigilante (Feifei)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2551178-lady-vigilante-feifei", "userReview": "5 WICKEDLY SENSUAL AND UTTERLY MINDBLOWING STARS!!!

Wow. Wow. It\u2019s been two days since I finished this book and I am still reeling from the explicit scenes, twisted and demented characters, and multi-layered story plot. This book has effectively blown my brains out. Our heroine, Maddy, is a sheltered cellist and on the night of her solo performance, she crosses paths with Aaron, the dangerously sexy and mysterious man who presents her with a single rose. Maddy unknowingly accepts his gift and her fate is sealed. She is thrust into a game between Joseph Carmichael, the evil and sadistic father, and his son Aaron, the coldhearted killer and executioner for the Estate. \n\u201cYou are now a slave. You caught the attention of the man to whom you now belong. You are to do as you are told without asking questions and you are to follow instructions exactly as they are given. Obedience is demanded from this point further. Any infraction on your part will have dire circumstances. Do you understand?\u201d\nAaron constantly struggles from being consumed by the same darkness that has infested his father. He is the Executioner, the Lawmaker, the Killer, the Enforcer, and with every act, every kill, he loses a piece of his soul, but is still able to retain his sanity. He needs control and to him, Madeleine is the temptress, the means of destroying him if he caves into his desire, and the ultimate decision that will allow his father to control him. Yet\u2026there is no staying away, for Aaron and Maddy are bound together in their love for music, creating a thin thread that connects their two hearts and souls in a world full of darkness and pain. \n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t just music that was elicited from the combination of wood, metal, and Madeleine, it was emotion, thought, a message only understood by those who could appreciate the fine combination of the sea of notes, blended together into an intoxicating song.\u201d\nThe plot twisted, their battles epic, and there wasn\u2019t a single moment I was left expressionless. Half of the time I was screaming and tearing my hair out, and the other half was a combination of crying and curling up in a corner to get away from the wickedness that emanates from this book. I cringed, I swore, I sobbed, but the feeling that dominated my emotions was fear. Fear that they wouldn\u2019t survive, fear that the monster would overtake them, fear\u2026Just so you can see how the book builds up in tension and action, here are my spoiler-free status updates I posted while I was reading the book.\n 1%: YEEEEEHAAA!!!

Madeleine, Abducted\u00a0was\u00a0a \n  dark\n and gritty captivity-themed romance. It read as a standalone and had no cliffhanger but the series is planned to be continued featuring a different couple. While, a few scenes throughout the book definitely pushed the limits of my comfort zones, others were quite romantic (in a dark and twisty way), but overall this book is\u00a0\nnot\n\u00a0for the faint of heart! However, if you\u2019re a fan of (very) dark romances, then definitely check this out!I'd started reading this book the other night intending to only 'test out' one chapter and before I knew it I was 40% in and still hooked so this became my impromptu next read. I mean, here's a part of the prologue below. It practically begs you to turn the page!\nWithin these page, you will find a tale typically left unsaid in polite society\u2026 It is a story about abduction, enslavement, and the moment when a life is delivered into darkness.\nThere is no neat and tidy ending, no white knight that rides in and delivers freedom, nor salvation -- there is no escape. Like life, stories don't always end with elegant edges.\u00a0\nA weak woman at one times, she fell victim to evil, disappeared on a fated night never to return to the world again\u2026 but not for the reasons you might think.\nHer name is Madeleine Clark, and when she was abducted, she was not only dragged into hell...\u00a0\nShe took over.\nYup. I\u00a0had to read this!So, the story begins when quiet, gentle concert cellist, Madeleine, is abducted following a performance effectively changing her entire life in a matter of minutes. Thrust into a dark, twisted world of sophisticated criminals, her rights, freedom and dignity was stripped away forcing her to assume her new role as slave at The Estate.\n\n\"This is your fate, Cricket. Asking why isn't going to do anything for you except make that fate a much more painful journey. You need to learn the rules of your position and learn them quickly if you want to make a smoother transition into your new role.\"\n\nIsolated from help and now under the control of a sadistic man who lived beyond the reach of the law, Maddy was \"gifted\" as a birthday present from father to son and suddenly found herself caught in a viscous power play between two powerful opponents: The father, and ruler of Estate, Joseph Carmichael, whose depraved, twisted descent into madness served only to strengthen his ruthless and insatiable taste for cruelty, and his son, Aaron, his executioner, second-in-command, and maybe.... some thing more.Having seen the brutality of his father, Madeleine was terrified to meet his son but she slowly discovered that there was something a little different about Aaron. There was a spark of.... humanity... buried behind his cold exterior. But he wasn't a good man. While Aaron may not have been as cruel as his father but there was a ruthless side of him as well -- one that took pleasure in the suffering of his enemies. However, he had no desire to follow in his father's footsteps and wanted nothing more than to bring an end to his reign but it soon became apparent that even though he may have been in a position of power in the Estate, while his father ruled, 'freedom' was still all relative.\n\"He seeks to control you, Aaron; to tame you by forcing you into corruption. It is the same fame you've played with I'm since the beginning.\"\nThe term 'hero' though is used rather loosely in regards to Aaron. I think it would be better to call him the 'love interest' instead. He was not a 'good guy\" and yet he had a soft spot for this woman who'd been thrust into his life against both their wills. Being around Maddy seemed to bring out a more gentle, compassionate side of him that wasn't in his nature.Maddy had a quiet strength about her and the instincts of a survivor. She seemed weak on the outside but as the story went on, we began to see just how strong she really was and how big her heart was.The romance however was very slow-building. It was there and was hinted at from the start but there was no insta-Stockholm-Syndrome or anything like that. It took a while before Aaron's tender side could even be shown to her and for the first while, he actually seemed quite cruel. But because we saw both sides of the story we understood that he too was trapped by his father.\n\n\"Dream of me, Maddy. See me as I want to be; not the nightmare who torments you, but the devoted and mystified man who worships at your feet.\u00a0\n\nBehind closed doors, Aaron began to show Maddy a different side of him but he couldn't fully give into his feelings. It was a combination of ruthlessness and kindness as he fought his feelings for her while being overpowered by his duty.\n\n\"You are not allowed thought anymore, your choices are mine, your actions are mine, everything you think or do will only be because I have allowed it\u2026 Your life depends on your submission. Do not fight against me now only to be handed over to men far more cruel that I can ever be.\"\n\nRomance aside, the story itself was quite erotic in a dark, gritty way. But it is not for the faint of heart. Many of the scenes were intense, as it would be expected in a dark romance such as this. But I will admit that here was one scene that just went too far for me. Like really\u00a0\ntoo far\n.\u00a0It was gruesome, shocking (and I'm not easily shocked) and honestly just sicking. Overkill. I just wanted to puke. I didn't like what it said about a certain character but in the end, but I guess just served as a chilling reminder that he\u00a0was\u00a0in fact a monster... just not in every way and, to a certain extent, that's what we look for in darker reads, right? Things that push the boundaries of our comfort zones? Let's just say though that this one crossed my personal line a little bit.Also, something random that stood out to me was that, while I understood that this book took place in modern day, it almost felt a little 'removed' from our world -- possibly because of how isolated the Estate was -- but even things like the way they talked was just... different, in places it almost felt borderline historical (even though it wasn't at all). This is not a complaint though, just an observation.And, while this was\u00a0not\u00a0a love triangle book, there were in fact two 'main' men in it -- the first being the 'hero', Aaron, and the second being his bodyguard and close friend, Xander, who ended up taking almost a more friendship-based role with regards to Madeleine. The next book will be his story and I really liked his character in this one and am looking forward to reading his book!Ohhhh and I thought it was\u00a0so cool that the image from the cover of the book is actually an exact scene from the book!! Like, everything matches perfectly and it very much captured the 'feeling' of the book. Just a really awesome touch!Overall, this really is a great dark read. I honestly didn't want to put it down and if you're looking for a book that doesn't hold back and will just deliver the dark and gritty right to you, then this is the one for you!4 stars (but I'm still totally grossed out by the scene at 89%)**************************** For more of my reviews, book news and updates:\u2726 Main blog: Aestas Book Blog\u2726 Facebook Blog Page\u2726 Twitter"}, {"userName": "Jennifer Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9916227-jennifer-kyle", "userReview": "3 - 3.5 Stars\n\u201dShe is light while I am darkness, she is raw beauty and so blessedly pure while I am nothing more than a poison to humanity.

This book...Damn. I struggled with my rating on this one. There were things I loved, things that disturbed the ever loving fuck out of me, and a few things I could have gone without. I love a dark romance, and this book definitely delivered on that front. This is not an easy read by any means. It's dark, gritty, disturbing, somewhat erotic, and not a book I'll be forgetting any time soon. The author does not play around. She tells you exactly what you're in for with the epilogue.Madeline is a talented yet an incredibly sheltered young cellist. When her talent catches the eye of a certain man, her life takes a dark twist. She is taken from the only life she knows, and is thrown in to a den of vipers where depravity, violence, and brutality become her new surroundings. Taken by a madman and given as a gift to his son for his 25th birthday, Maddy finds herself in the middle of a deadly game of power. While her new Master might not be quite as evil as the man that kidnapped her, she knows that he's just hiding a different type of darkness.Aaron is The Estate executioner.

While his brutality is the key to keeping her alive\n\nI promised you pain for pain, Madeleine, and it only makes my cock harder when you fight back.

I\u2019ll never be a person worthy of you, of the beauty and light you provide to this world. I kill, I steal, I lie and I cheat. I take pleasure when I bathe in the blood of another man\u2019s demise, when I watch the life drain from their eyes as they die. I enjoyed you as well, Maddy, not when I had to hurt you, but when I took things from your body that weren\u2019t mine to take. I\u2019ve done nothing for you, Mouse, nothing but what I wanted to do.\"\n\nBut then again, I always do seem to go for the tortured and broody ones.I loved the author's writing style, it was almost poetic at times. There was a flip side of it for me though. I felt it was a bit much at times. There was almost too many descriptive sentences. I lost count of the many different ways that Aaron's green eyes came across. It was a bit much for me. At times it almost read like a historical to me. I struggled to remember that this is set in a modern setting.The brutality. I am not a virgin to dark and gritty reads, but some of the scenes in this book disturbed even me. The event that takes place at 89% for instance. It takes A LOT, and I do mean A LOT to truly disturb me, but fuck...that scene still fucking haunts me. The romance. This took a while to really get into. It took a backseat to a lot of other things that were developing in the first half of the book. Don't get me wrong, I wasn't expecting instant Stockholm here. This is not really a complaint, but I do feel it necessary to mention.Aaron's background. We didn't get much except for little hints and words. This is a continuing series, so maybe it will be covered in the future books.Aaron's father. Holy shit! Holy fucking shit! I have never...and I mean never spent so much time picturing killing a fictional character in quite such brutal fucking detail as I did here. The man was a sadistic asshole. The things that he did...Holy shit...just holy fucking shit. This book had some of the most brutal and descriptive scenes I have read in a while (And I've read and loved Captive/Seduced in the Dark, SKALS, and all of Madeline Sheehan books. I'm not exactly a fucking innocent here). I was left gaping, reeling, and so fucking disturbed I almost felt like I needed to take a break after reading those scenes. FUCK!On a lighter note, I loved that even though Maddy was innocent, sheltered, naive, and in an impossible situation, she still came across as strong. Aaron was a great hero as well. My heart broke for him and his struggle. He tries so hard to protect Maddy from the brutality of The Estate, and when he failed at certain times, it was heart breaking.In short, although this wasn't quite the amazing 5 star read it was to many of my GR friends, I still enjoyed it thoroughly. With the little peaks the author gave us of Xander, I cannot wait for his book next.For more reviews visit"}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11971939-jamie", "userReview": "Wow.. just holy fucking shit wow.

This story was gritty and raw. It will make you cringe and tremble in anticipation of the depraved acts you know are just around the corner. At the same time, there is an unexpected element of kindness and humanity weaved into the story, as the slave finds a surprising ally in her master. I figured out quickly that this was not the typical \"guy takes girl and falls in love, becomes remorseful, turns a new leaf...\" kind of romance. While many of those characteristics are present, this story puts a different spin on the archetypal kidnapper/slave story. It wasn't what I had been expecting. It was much better!Madeleine, aka Maddy, is a renowned cellist that is kidnapped by a cruel crime boss, Joseph Carmichael. She quickly finds out that she has been taken to be gifted as a sex slave to his son, Aaron. Incredibly shy and naive, Maddy is plunged into a world of sexual depravity and barbarity that she had never fathomed existed in her worst nightmares. She is humiliated and debased repeatedly. Through it all, she manages to grow stronger and never loses sight of her own humanity. Aaron is appalled by his father's birthday \"gift\", but knows that he must accept the slave and train her. He immediately recognizes Madeleine as the cellist that he had admired from a distance and knows that she now bears a fate worse than death because of his infatuation with her. Training her to be his slave will break him as well, all for the amusement of his sadistic father.I don't want to ruin this story for anyone. I'll just say that I could not put this book down once I started. I was pulled into the story and became enraptured with the plight of Maddy and Aaron. There is no knight in shining armor. Aaron is an assassin and revels in the thrill of a kill. He enjoys inflicting pain and struggles against his baser urges not to use and abuse Maddy in the most despicable ways.This book is gripping, heart-breaking, suspenseful and raw. If you like a dark romance, then you don't want to pass this book by.

While Aaron may not be as cruel as his father there is a ruthless side of him as well -- one that takes pleasure in the suffering of the people he kills.

See me as I want to be; not the nightmare who torments you, but the devoted and mystified man who worships at your feet. ~Aaron\n\nPutting the romance issue aside, the story itself was quite erotic in a dark, disturbing way. Let me repeat again, this story is NOT for the faint of heart! Many of the scenes were disturbing, as would be expected in a dark novel such as this. I will say that there is one scene that just went too far for me. It was gruesome, disturbing, and honestly just sickening. I just wanted to puke, I literally had to put the book down I was so grossed out.The character of Aaron was complex. He was not a good man, but yet he had a softness for Maddy that I found endearing. My main problem with Maddy and Aaron was that I found it hard to connect with them. While this story is definitely entertaining, I found that I never cried, never got emotionally worked up, or felt that I couldn't put this book down. I am excited to read Xander's story next, but this isn't a story that will be added to my favorites list. Loose ends are not tied up, there is little to no romance, in fact the word love isn't even mentioned, also there aren't even that many sex scenes in it. I found myself wanting to read a longer story which unfortunately won't happen since this is a standalone for Maddy and Aaron. All in all it was just okay. Entertaining, but just okay. \n\n\"This man, her warrior \u2026 a dark knight, if anything, but not really a knight at all. He wasn't a good man, he\u2019d committed countless acts of violence in his life, and he was considered the most lethal man of The Estate. When it came to Maddy, however, he was another man entirely, a man that would kill to set her free, who would lay down his life if it would save her.\"\n\n*I would recommend this novel to anyone looking for a dark gritty read*"}, {"userName": "Kirsten", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23049700-kirsten", "userReview": "4.5 Cricket/Mouse stars! \n\nIntroverted Madeleine hides behind her cello. As a talented musician and composer, the shy girl is highlighted during a performance at a concert hall. Afterwards, she is approached by a handsome man who presents her with a single red rose. She thinks nothing of the exchange with the man with the beautiful green eyes. Upon leaving, Madeleine is greeted by an older gentleman with two companions who drug and abduct her. When she wakes, she is chained to a bed, and then instructed to get into a box. She is going to be a gift to her new master. She is surprised to see that she will now be owned by the man who was at the concert hall.\n***at time of posting I realized that it says legal instead of lethal...oh well**LOL oops! Aaron is appalled by the birthday gift he has received from his father. He cannot believe that his father has taken the woman whose music has touched his soul. As the leader of The Estate, Joseph is the epitome of depraved and evil. As his son, the role he plays is the executioner for the business. He may be a cold-blooded killer, but he is not interested in owning a woman/slave. Especially the beautiful and innocent Madeleine. As his father is falling deeper and deeper into madness, there is no way he can refuse this gift. She could be put to death, or worse yet, become a whore for The Estate, where she will be raped, abused, and tortured. The only choice he has is to take Madeleine as his, and try to keep her as much out of harms way until he takes over. He still has to be under the guise that he is using her as his slave, but time may be running out.\nWhile in close quarters, Aaron experiences lust and other protective feelings towards Madeleine. In turn, she is starting to recognize that although she is held captive, he may not be the person she should be fearing. \n\nThis was a very enjoyable dark read. The plot definitely messed with my mind. Even though Aaron is an assassin, he has a kind heart and knows right from wrong. I can't imagine what he went through to keep peace with his deranged father and make it look like Maddy was his slave, yet not step out of bounds when it came to the treatment of her. Not only did I like Aaron and the strong Madeleine, but Xander, Aaron's right hand man was also a great character. In the beginning I wasn't sure who would be Maddy's love interest, as it seemed Xander was a little smitten by the sweet woman. He was the one to nickname her \"cricket\", and Aaron referred to her as \"mouse\". I liked how eventually all of them came together as a team of sorts. The events that the trio were involved in were cringe worthy, and kept me on the edge of my seat. Joseph was a cruel and vile human being, and the mind games he played with his son were truly fucked up. The ending was especially brutal, and I couldn't read fast enough to see what would happen. I also want to mention how much I enjoyed the writing. It was descriptive and in a way, beautiful and...lyrical. It really painted a dark picture for what was taking place. The writing is in third person, and has POV's through the three characters. Overall an awesome dark romance. I would recommend if this is a genre that you like.

Lets add that to my list.Then I got an arc *happy dance* saw the first page and the warning just got me even more excited!! This is a story that is not meant for the faint of heart.If you are looking for inspiration, if you are looking for light, if you are looking for something that will help you sleep and dream, you've come to the wrong place.C'mon after reading that you think..\"Madeleine didn't mind people hearing her music, she preferred not being seen, being protected withing the studia or her home, invisible to the eyes of the world.\"Madeleine is a cellist,a shy quiet woman who has been sheltered all her life.She likes to stay hidden and through music she expresses herself.One night after an amazing performance where she takes center stage for the first time things change.That night changes Maddy's whole life, she will never get her sheltered life back again.\nShe is taken.Abducted.To become a slave to her master.To only speak when told to do so.She is taken to The Estate. \nJoseph Carmichael head of The Estate, a sick, demented, disgusting human who is determined to get his son Aaron to follow in his footsteps, to have the evil consume him and for him to live The Estate lifestyle is the reason Maddy's life is flipped upside down. As Aaron is drawn to her music his father decides Maddy wrapped in a bow would be a suitable present for his son.The last thing Aaron wants is to be like his father, an evil,sick man but he can't refuse his gift, he can't let Maddy die. Will he allow the evil to consume him?Deep breaths, Maddy...you can do this..Aaron has lived in The Estate since he was a child with his best friend and guard Xander..rape, slavery, abuse surrounded them.They have killed but never would they rip apart a life of an innocent and condemn them to slavery, abuse and rape.Together they have a plan to end it all..I was intrigued and hooked on this, the story is written very well, with a slightly poetic touch to it.The characters were great I loved the light and darkness aspect to it.Even with all the darkness surrounding Aaron he found a way to cling to that little bit of light and Madeleine is a true survivor even with all the lightness she brings to Aaron's life there is much more to her.She is a strong woman who adapts to her traumatic life situation and learns to live, learns to rule and learns to carry on no matter what happens. \"Although it is easy to scream for a victim to run or fight when you see them in a movie or read about them in a book, the futility of the situation is far more evident when you find yourself in their place.\"This book is in Maddy, Aaron and even some bits from Xanders POV. I didn't really understand why Xander's POV was required at the start I was worried it would turn into a love triangle, which I would have hated so yeah so glad when that wasn't the case. The next book is on Xander! Yay can't wait!!\"Although it is easy to scream for a victim to run or fight when you see them in a movie or read about them in a book, the futility of the situation is far more evident when you find yourself in their place.\"Bravo M.S.Willis you have done an excellent job on this one!So dark, disturbing book lovers this one is for you, go grab it ;) ~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*~**ARC courtesy of the author in exchange for an honest review**Check out my blog for more reviews!http://zakirrahsbookblog.blogspot.co.uk/Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Zakirr..."}, {"userName": "Johanna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10198457-johanna", "userReview": "*~*~*4 Deliciously Seductive & Captivating Stars*~*~*~*~\u201cShe is light while I am darkness, she is raw beauty and so blessedly pure while I am nothing more than a poison to humanity.She deserves her life far more than I deserve mine.\u201d\nMadeleine Abducted is a uniquely woven tail of a young woman's journey into slavery and her beautiful captor's fascination with her. We a have Maeleine Clark; a beautiful, shy, successful cellist player.\nOn the night of her first solo performance, Maddy's life takes a turn for the worst.\nMaddy is suddenly thrust into a world of darkness, sadistic, and cruelty, its a life in which she must endure to survive. Along with being captured she finds herself in a cruel and twisted power struggle between sadistic father and son, Aaron.Her life hangs in the balance of this man.\nSeemingly dangerous and uncaring, Aaron manages the business operations of his father's estate. Wanting nothing to do with the slaves kept at the Estate, Aaron refuses to take part in the deeper depravities of his father. Despite his resistance, Aaron's father gifts him a petite, brunette woman he cant refuse.A bond is forged in conspiracy and deceit, Aaron struggles to save Maddy by teaching her to survive in the world in which he's been raised. An unlikely union, Aaron soon learns that great strengths can exist in small packages, while Madeleine learns that love and light can exist in the darkest places. Madeleine learns that there is goodness and light in Aaron's soul and she is willing to sacrifice her freedom in order for him to cleanse his soul. In the process, of learning her role as slave she gets to learn more about Aaron's cruel past and his predicament. As the days turn into weeks, Maddy gets to learn and understand Aaron, and finally succumbs to her true feelings pertaining to Aaron. It also helps that their sexual interludes are HOT & SEXY... \n\nMy thoughts:\n Madeleine Abducted is a good dark read for those of you seeking something gritty and different. It has HOT sexual scenes that leaves you imagining you could be Madeleine Clark. This tale is different from most Stockholm syndrome novels, it is done intricately well, and quite original. My little rant is that the story is told through a 3rd person perspective which in my opinion is harder to connect to the characters. Also, the constant dialogue flip flopping between different characters.

This was a gripping story that caught my attention within the first 20% of starting it. I have been known to enjoy some very dark and twisted stories, and this one definitely had its moments where I was cringing and sick to my stomach as I was reading. There are a few scenes in particular that were very disturbing; but I expected no less from such a dark book! If you are a reader that is looking for a flowery romance book; this is not it..The hero in this story is a man who is labelled \"The executioner\" for a reason, and he even takes extreme pleasure in spilling the people's blood that he is ordered to kill. The fascinating part about Aaron though, is that somewhere deep down inside himself, there is a small ray of light that is hidden so well that even he is unaware that it is there. It takes a musician that captures Aaron's attention during a concert to recognize that the light is there. Maddy is the one who ends up nourishing that light, and slowly the darness lessens; but only a tiny bit. The truth of the matter is that Aaron has to be a monster for his own protection from the one who is true evil; his father. If any weakness is shown, then his father will destroy the person who shows it and he will enjoy every minute of that person's pain and demise.All of this brutality takes place at \"The Estate.\" It is isolated and has its own community inside the violent and depraved walls. Aaron's father enjoys to play mind games, and takes great pleasure in others pains. He is a man that is losing his mind to insanity, as well as to the drugs that he ingests. This is the man that abducts Madeline, all because Aaron had shown an interest in her. So, dear old dad brings her to the Estate to be a slave for his son. When Aaron learns of how his father stole an innocent woman all in the name of a sick game for his pleasure; Aaron realizes his father's insanity has gone too far. Aaron decides he needs to do something about his sadistic father, and sets a plan in motion.Maddy was a pleasant surprise to me, as she starts out very meek in the beginning; but gradually her strength within herself shines through. The way that she was able to see the good in Aaron, even through all his gruesome actions was amazing. Aaron also was an interesting character, because even though he was evil to so many he had an extreme need to protect Maddy. The ironic thing was that sometimes in order to protect her, he would have to do some unforgivable things to her. If he didn't do it, then an even more evil person would deliver a harsher punishment to Maddy.So Aaron protected her in the only way he could.This book is one that you won't want to put down while you are reading it. For lovers of dark tales this is a book you don't want to miss. It is important no to expect a romance that is full of love and cute moments. It is nothing like that, and it is down right disturbing in certain scenes. There is a relationhip that unites two people who are both stuck living in \"Hell\", and it is inspiring how Maddy is able to overlook all of Aaron's evil and grow to care about him. Their common cause is to seek retributiion and justice, and the question is..do they win against evil, or do they lose the fight? You will be on the edge of your seat in anticipation, wondering who will come out on top.."}, {"userName": "Carla \u263aDid I Say That\u263a", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12275363-carla-did-i-say-that", "userReview": "WOW!!!"}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11729661-elaine", "userReview": "I love it when this type of story is done well..Madeleine Abducted is one of those storiesBrilliant Dark and delicious 4 StarsMaddy is a musician, shy and quiet and nervous that she has just had to preformed her solo concert.

There are HUGE amounts of graphic violence, sex and intense scenes.I love me a good kidnapping book, you throw in an assassin, well there\u2019s gonna be a party in my pants people.SUMMARYMadeleine is a cellist, on the night of one of performances, she is abducted by an older wealthy man, who intends to gift Madeleine, as a sex slave, to his son, Aaron, for Aaron\u2019s 25th birthday. Aaron is no angel, as an assassin since the age of 14, he is tired of the way his father rules the estate and Aaron binds his time before he can take over. However, with Madeleine\u2019s presence, she could disrupt Aaron\u2019s plans. Overall reviewMadeleine (Maddy) is quickly abducted within the first chapter of the book. I love this, there is no BS, we get to the heart of the matter. When Madeleine first arrives at the estate she is introduced to Xander, Aaron\u2019s right hand man. She\u2019s been hit and is completely naked as Xander and other men get her ready for Aaron. At first glance you notice that Maddy\u2019s music has sheltered her and she hasn\u2019t really been exposed to the world.She is weak and she is a true damsel in distress. I freaking love it.When we first meet Aaron, we find him cold, distant and basically an asshole. He yells commands towards Madeleine and provides punishment when she disobeys him. But not everything is what it seems. Once you get to know Aaron and see what truly lies behind the mask of the monster you start to understand why he is the way he is.There is plenty of tension between Maddy and Aaron. This is only one of the many things that happen in the book. Many times Aaron\u2019s father comes into the picture to test Aaron\u2019s loyalties and those are probably one the hardest parts to read in the book.As stated, there is rape, violence and lots of graphic scenes. The author goes into detail of death, blood and the gore that comes along with it. I was not surprised by these parts. I felt like it was a necessary black cloud that was needed to make this book dark. Madeleine Abducted needed to be longer and needs a new cover. The book was too short to convey its full emotions. I would say the first half was fine, I got it, I was just glued to the pages. When we get to the shift with the second half, it was a bit rushed and as much as I enjoyed the crazy climax, it was a bit rushed. As for the cover, it does no justice for this book. It\u2019s a beautiful story and needs something less in your face.However, with those minor complaints aside, it\u2019s a beautiful story about pain, manipulation and love. If you like dark reads, love kidnappings and intense love stories, this one is for you. But I warn you, it\u2019s fucking crazy.

The story begins with Madeleine (I am going to call her M for time purposes) playing her cello at a concert. We get little to no background on M other than that she appears to be very naive, very sheltered, very shy, very quiet, very reserved. She's greeted by a beautiful stranger after the concert, admiring her music. It's when Madeleine is leaving the concert, that she is abducted and sent to The Estate only to discover that she is to be \"gifted\" as a slave to the beautiful stranger from the concert.

Aaron refuses to \"take\" M as his slave....not when she has been sent there without choice. But at the same time, she has to appear as the slave she was meant to be. Through the process, the lines blur for Aaron and M. For me personally, I didn't get their relationship, I didn't connect to it. It all happened too fast. I felt like M did a 180 going from loathing and fighting the fact that she was a slave to having strong feelings for Aaron and wanting to be his slave willingly. IDK.

Madeleine for me was for the most part your typical slave. She was scared...as she should have been. She fought back even though her natural personality was timid. She proved though, at the end of the book, that she would take no shit and she would rule Hell the best way she knew how. Joseph....holy bejesus.. He was scary. Sick...twisted...harsh...brutal.

You caught the attention of the man to whom you now belong. You are to do as you are told without asking questions and you are to follow instructions exactly as they are given.\" Before starting these kind of books I'm always a little bit scared. I like dark books, but there's always the chance I'll go too dark and then I'll be scarred for life. So I went into this with some trepidation and with Johanna to support me for this BR. The book takes a while before it picks up. In the beginning I was thinking to myself \"nothing's happening\" and then the pace picks up quite nicely. SlaveMasterGoodEvil\n\"I warned you,\" he said. \n In the beginning we meet Aaron who's just received an unusual birthday present from his father: a slave named Madeleine who is a beautiful, timid musician. Aaron is disgusted with his father, and the gift he has bestowed on him. Even though Aaron is not a \"nice\" guy, he does not participate in the nefarious activities carried on in The Estate. In order to protect Maddy, he has to train her like a slave so she won't be passed on to suffer even more.  \"I intend to introduce you to the darker side of life, to teach you what a man can do for you, to make you beg for more.\"  I liked Maddy instantly, she wasn't whiny, talkative, or overly dramatic. In fact she resigns herself to her situation very quickly after realizing there's no way to free herself. There are some really disgusting parts, that may cause persons with weak stomachs to regurgitate what they've eaten. This may not be very dark for some, but since I'm usually wary of books like this, to me it was. There's no cliffhanger, but the author does set things up for a continuation of the story in book two. Xander, Aaron's right hand man, was without a doubt my favorite character. I'm beyond thrilled that his story will be told next. I'm guessing we'll see a totally different side of him in his book. I love his loyalty and obedience to Aaron.Every scene with Aaron's dad, Joseph, and his minionsWhy four stars?My biggest complaint is that there wasn't enough sex and the scenes present were not detailed enough. Jeez! I sound sex obsessed. I can assure you I'm not :)Rating: 4 Darkly Entertaining Stars Buddy read with the lovely Johanna!!!

No, Aaron's father, Joseph Carmichael, was extremely dark and disturbing. Aaron was dark and he did disturbing things being the executioner of \"the estate,\" but he wasn't evil or unredeemable.I liked the flow of this book and how Maddie turned fierce warrior despite being uprooted and kidnapped by a sadistic pyschopath at the height of her musical career. She was strong and unwilling to face defeat as a coward.I also liked how her and Aaron came to rely and confide in one another, falling in love and finding good while surrounded by the bad. What I wasn't impressed with was the way the characters spoke in this book. Almost like they were from a different time. I understand refined speech, but this was something that made me question what century they were in sometimes.It would have been more believable for me if I saw glimmers of Aaron's youth through bouts of vulnerability or just different speech patterns. Maddie was believable but her words of endearment were dated, not reminiscent of a young woman sheltered from the world.There was lots of violence but I wasn't shocked or disgusted. I don't mind violence but I've seen it written more accurately and more viscerally that I wasn't as affected as I should have been.Just for example purposes, the Dark Duet, by C.J Roberts is my benchmark for dark, gritty kidnapping-romance. The gore and violence was palpable and done so well I was gasping. It had similar themes but much more affecting.Regardless, many people have read and loved this book so there are many 5 star reviews to check out for a different opinion, but I wasn't impressed as much as I had wanted to be, so not quite 3 stars for me.Also, although this is a standalone, the series continues focusing on other characters and the rebuilding of a new era for the Estate."}, {"userName": "Zaynab", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18831635-zaynab", "userReview": "5 Abducted stars!!!"}, {"userName": "Steelwhisper", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7962895-steelwhisper", "userReview": "There's a reason why \"Silence of the Lambs\" is a classic, and the average splatter film is released straight to video.
