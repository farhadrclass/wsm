The series follows the life of successful News reporter Erica Sparks who in this book is covering the USA Presidential election. She decides to follow leading candidate Senator Mike Ortiz who seems dependent on his wife to an unnatural degree. The Senators wife Celeste Ortiz is a brilliant and glamorous billionaire who has engineered her husband\u2019s meteoric rise. The White House is within their reach but the more Erica investigates the stranger their relationship appears.I would like to thank Net Galley and Thomas Nelson Fiction for supplying me with a copy of this novel in exchange for a honest review."}, {"userName": "Hristina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17945431-hristina", "userReview": "I've been staring at this for about ten minutes, and I don't know what to say.

With the current politics going on, I was intrigued by this story and wanted to see if there was anything relevant to learn from it. However, MOST of this book is about investigative reporting, mind control, and conspiracy. It was disturbing and creepy. Even though the entire book is taken from Erica\u2019s perspective (the reporter), there are a few scenes which feature Celeste and Lily\u2019s scheming ways up close.I also found most of the book to be summarized, not experienced, from Erica\u2019s perspective as she desperately tries to balance being a successful workaholic and giving her heart to be a good mom. She has trouble balancing these roles and can\u2019t seem to get a break being with her daughter. Normally I enjoy kids being in a story, but her daughter came off as angry and annoying during most of the book. I was surprised that even though the book is detailed and well written, I just didn\u2019t feel like I was there with Erica until the last 20% of the plot when the action REALLY picks up. The violence is another element that caught me off guard. There is no profanity or sexual content (Celeste uses sex to manipulate her husband but nothing is described), but innocent people do get killed and two of the scenes described in the plot are very graphic. I understand that Christian fiction has violence in it, but the content in The Candidate was more disturbing than I anticipated. Sensitive readers, be cautioned.I honestly didn\u2019t even expect a happy ending from the way the story felt, too many things go wrong and Erica takes INCREDIBLE risks to get to the truth of the matter before America has voted for president. From the start of the story, it\u2019s obvious that Celeste controls her husband and that their relationship is unnatural. However, when revelations and evidence are discovered, the story takes a much darker turn than I believed was possible.I also felt uncertain about the relationship between Celeste and Lily. They are best friends from college, but there are a few scenes that it seemed like they were lovers based on Celeste\u2019s obsession with the woman. Again, that was weird considering this is Christian fiction. The ending did not impress me one way or another, there was a villain who takes their life and their last words were an insult. Considering how intelligent and driven this person is, I thought for sure their last words would be better spoken than that. In one of the violent scenes of the story, Erica is reporting live when someone is killed in front of her. The plot explains later that the footage won\u2019t be played on the news because it\u2019s too grisly for viewing. I really wish that were true in real life, but it didn\u2019t feel authentic to me.I did love two parts of the book, one was a phone conversation with celebrity Bob De Niro and one was meeting celebrity Julianne Moore.Overall, an interesting book, but it felt more robotic and disturbing than anything else. Maybe I\u2019m not the intended audience for this author. I liked it, but it wasn\u2019t the pleasant read I was going for.I want to thank Netgalley and Thomas Nelson for the review copy provided. I was not required to write a positive review. The thoughts expressed are my own."}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "A special thank you to Thomas Nelson and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review. Lis Wiehl returns following  The Newsmakers, (2014) with THE CANDIDATE, a continuation of her riveting series featuring an unstoppable heroine,  Newscaster Erica Sparks,  we met in Newmakers #1; Blonde, beautiful, driven and sharp. A mother. A haunted past. A daughter. A second chance. A journalist who wants to be her best. Uncovering the truth, no matter where it leads. To shine the light of fairness on injustice and inequality. At the same time stand up to the high and mighty. This time, around, Erica is powerful and respected- she\u2019s the host of the highest rated news show in the country. Someone is watching her. Where things are not as they seem. The Presidential campaign. How far will a candidate go to become president?Erica has a nightly news  show, The Erica Sparks Effect,  with a superior reputation. From book one we catch up with Greg, the man she loves, currently in Australia, working crazy hours to help launch a cable news network. She misses him \u2013 they have been apart for three months. There is also her best friend, Moira Connelly, a fellow reporter \u2013 now an evening co- anchor on a local LA station. Previously, Erica exposed Nylan Hastings, the psychopath in The Newsmakers  and now her new boss, Mort Silver wants to see her show on top. He is not pleased with the numbers. The presidential campaign is heating up and Erica wants to be a part of it. She needs to keep her career certain at GNN. She needs a big story.We also catch up with Jenny,  Erica\u2019s daughter, now a pre-teen. Jenny feels neglected and sometimes can be resentful, but Erica has to work hard in order to pay for her school and their apartment. She recently transitioned from her father and friends in Massachusetts to New York. The demands of her job are staggering, a pressure cooker. She has to find more time for Jenny. She has an excellent staff but needs a personal assistant. There are also the dark things.  When introduced to Erica in the first book, she continues to hear haunting mocking voices from her mother. It spreads like a toxic spill deep into her psyche. She always feels like something terrible is going to happen. The slip in her ratings and the driving pressure she feels to deliver a big story has only exacerbated her night terrors.Celeste went to Stanford  and then Stanford law, and then the Harvard B-school, and then into international banking where she became Wall Street\u2019s go-to person (with friend Lily Lau) making her own vast fortune.And now she is married to California Senator Mike Oritz,  who stands a very good chance of becoming the next president of the United States. Which of course, will make Celeste the most powerful person in the world. With Lily Lau\u2014who will be named President Oritz\u2019s chief of staff by her side. Celeste is a powerful  an intriguing woman in her own right\u2014heiress to a car dealership, and international banker specializing in China markets. She has put her own career on hold to work for her husband\u2019s campaign to which she has donated twenty million dollars. The couple is glamorous and powerful. Mike is a war hero,  a marine in Iraq and was elected to Congress. Determined to return to Iraq and was kidnapped. He escaped. He has enormous political talent. A bomb. Erica was there. Dead and injured. Evil in the world. Fifteen people died in the Buchanan bomber attack, forty-two injured, eight in critical condition. The country is reeling. She flashes back to the Staten Island ferry crashed that launched her career. Is it possible this horrific act was also orchestrated by unseen forces who want Erica to be on the scene? Can she trust the people at GNN?Something happened  before the bomb blast, she cannot put her finger on it. She can\u2019t remember. Something is not right. She tries to recall what stuck in her mind. Something to do with Mike Ortiz. But, what? It was also like the possible next President of the US needed his wife\u2019s permission to speak. She hates the network\u2019s  obsession with ratings at a time like this. She is ambitious but she never wants it to cross the line into ruthless. The Erica Sparks Effect is treated with respect and integrity. No games. The bombing upended the presidential campaign and needs to be ready to hop on a plane at a moment\u2019s notice. The FBI, CIA, and Department of Justice are trying to identify the bomber. Who stands to gain the most from the Buchanan\u2019s death? What is with Celeste and Lau's relationship? Power? Erica knows evil and power from nailing Nylan Hastings. She is having trouble sleeping and jumps at every noise, worried about Jenny\u2019s safety on the streets of New York. Erica begins studying  her file on Mike Ortiz. His working class upbringing, an activist, community organizer, his tour duty in the second Iraq War, his subsequent election to Congress and marriage to heiress and banker Celeste Pierce.Also his capture and incarceration by Al-Qaeda while on a humanitarian mission to Iraq. His subsequent escape made him a national hero and propelled him into the Senate. A compelling story \u2013 one which may carry him to the White House.  She still is fascinated with the power dynamics with his wife. His wife seems to have a great deal of control over him. She seems strange. Brilliant and driven but Erica senses rage lurking behind the polished surface. Mike says he was tortured  and threatened and once he escaped made the decision to fight. A purpose, a mission. To inspire every American to join him in the fight to make their country a more, perfect union. What really happened when he was held, prisoner? Who is in control? Why? Erica is determined to find answers. Someone is threatened by her investigation, as Erica closes in.  The debate. The moderator. A race against the clock.With the nation\u2019s future  at stake, Erica is determined to bring down the conspiracy, and psychopath attempting to take over the presidency, and at the same time puts herself and her daughter in danger, while her own past threatens her. Will she be able to outsmart them before it is too late, and bring the truth to light?An action-packed  political suspense thriller of power, and intrigue! A nice balance of personal/professional with Greg and Erica\u2019s relationship. (a happy ending). She has grown tremendously since the last book with her demons and enjoyed the mother/daughter dynamics with Jenny. Also, fun catching up with BFF, Moira. A smart chilling suspense series with a dynamic protagonist! An avid fan of Lis Wiehl, and  Wiehl of Justice  FOX News Radio- One of the nation\u2019s most prominent trial lawyers and highly regarded commentators, she is also the host of the podcast which is always fun and juicy--featuring other crimes, and crime authors. In addition, I have enjoyed reading Wiehl's previous books:   Mia Quinn  mystery series, and Snapshot an enthralling tale of good versus evil, inspired by actual historical events, civil rights movement and injustice-- landing on my  Top Books of 2014  \u2014while anxiously awaiting her next upcoming new release. Wiehl\u2019s books  are plot-driven, edgy, fast-paced suspense; featuring strong yet, flawed heroines, faced with numerous obstacles, striving for justice. From lies, deceit, menace, corruption, and power. You can come to expect to meet an evil twisted villain.

Still, the process is interesting to me if only because of my background in journalism and psychology, so the description of this book was too intriguing to pass up when I was offered the opportunity to read it in exchange for an honest review.And my honest opinion is this: While the plot doesn't rank at the top of my believability scale, it's a fast-paced, suspenseful and well-written story that I had trouble putting down and polished off in a day-and-a-half of spare time. It is, I should add, the second featuring network news host Erica Sparks (it follows The Newsmakers). But while there are a few references here to events in the other one - and it's probably a good idea to read it first - this book stands on its own quite well.Erica, it seems, is in the throes of a rather conflicted life. She loves her job, but her significant other is off building a TV network in a faraway country. Erica's 11-year-old daughter Jenny has agreed to leave her father and come to live with her, but especially because Erica's work takes her away so often, the two are having a tough time really bonding. That issue is exacerbated when, faced with a ratings drop and the need to land a really big story, Erica turns her attention to the Presidential election. Mostly to help with Jenny, she hires Becky, a young aspiring journalist, as her personal assistant.One of the two candidates, Mike Ortiz, has capitalized on his war hero status to become the favorite. He's got a gorgeous, wealthy and never far from his side wife, Celeste, who in turn has a beautiful, powerful close friend and adviser, Lily Lau, who's a real piece of work (in the authors' words, \"her sangfroid has sangfroid\").As the final debate of the campaign approaches, Erica begins to notice that something may be amiss in the interaction between Ortiz, his wife and Ms. Lau. As she investigates, questions also arise about what really happened to the candidate during the nine months he claims to have spent in the Al Qaeda prison. But as Erica lines up people who might offer insights, her efforts are thwarted by a string of unexpected deaths and questions about who can be trusted. In between are hints of media manipulation, mind control, conspiracy theories and, of course, the threat of personal danger to Erica and those she loves.It's a thoroughly captivating story, though as I mentioned before, more than a little far-fetched. Erica's powers of perception go far beyond those of mere humans (even those of a seasoned journalist), and others around her are far too quick to buy into her suppositions. Toward the end, the pace picks up to get to the finish but crosses the line of credibility (well heck, this is a work of fiction, after all). The bottom line is it's a fun, enjoyable way to spend a few hours, and I look forward to the next installment."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1037839-erika", "userReview": "Awful. This book was just awful. The ONLY reason I finished was because I got it from Netgalley and I wanted to be able to write a complete review, but I had to rethink that decision about a billion times because it felt like I was reading for an interminable amount of time. It never got any better.I think I was partly a target audience for this book because I love politics and mystery and I don't know quite how it all went wrong. The dialogue was so unrealistic to me, and I remember reading a specific part during a date with the main character and a new guy and thinking that's what I thought people sounded like when I was thirteen and I hadn't been in a relationship. The main character had just found out from a Tweet that she thought her fianc\u00e9 was cheating on her by the way he looked in a picture. The next week she's out with Mr. New Guy and thinking, well I still have some feelings for Ex Fianc\u00e9 but there is real potential here with New Guy and he seems even better. And I should just let Ex Fianc\u00e9 go, he cheated. This is a very specific example but there were a lot of situations like this that didn't ring at all true in my eyes.The main character is an alcoholic, but she's got her shit together, she's sober and she has a big job and a kid and she does well with it. At one point she's having a hard time and she decides to take a Xanax to help her sleep. She thinks about it and is considering not taking it because it seems like a stepping stone to a drink but in the end decides it's just to make her sleep and there isn't anything wrong with that. There are SO many things wrong with that I don't even know where to start. I guess I won't. There are some interesting things in here but they get dropped by the wayside in the conflict of the main character's personal life. I hate giving reviews that are this bad, but I just hated this book. I thought this was a debut and I was shocked when I saw that she has written a few books before this. Maybe I should just blame it on Christmas?"}, {"userName": "Joni Dee", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51708631-joni-dee", "userReview": "I've been given the opportunity to read and review Lis Wiehl & Sebastian Stuart second Erica Sparks novel: \"The Candidate\".As a lover of political thrillers, I must say that this novel disappointed me, I will explain why soon after the summary of the plot.Sparks is a rising star in GNN, a fictional CNN like network, after apparently exposing a shocking plot related to Nylan Hastings GNN's tycoon owner, in the first book (I have not read the first book of the series so excuse me if this is a poor account of the events).In \"The Candidate\" the rising star covers the presidential campaign, with the elections only a few weeks away. With a catastrophe hitting the democratic summit, it looks like Sen. Ortiz - the movie star like war hero - is on his sure path to the presidency. But in Erica's book something\u2019s amiss: is it Ortiz mechanic like conduct? His wife Celeste who seems to be holding a tight leash? or the Ortizes' all mysterious advisor and fried Lily Lau? While struggling with her own personal life: custody of her daughter and distance relationship with her fianc\u00e9e, Sparks will stop at nothing to get to the bottom of the case!In short (why I was disappointed): The characters are weak, I could not connect with anyone, especially not with Erica Sparks, not to mention the bond villain like Lily Lau. The plot is farfetched, and implausible. The writing is too fast paced for my liking and lacks needed imagery. On the bright side: it's a gripping tale, which would make a good Hollywood movie someday.I was especially put off with the recurring references to the first novel, I deemed it unnecessary to establish Spark's current stardom, nor was I impressed with Sparks love-life: she \u201cfalls\u201d for one of her daughter's friend's dad, then takes back her alleged cheating fianc\u00e9e... uncharacteristicallyl.I awarded the novel 2 star, which is somewhat lower than my usual ratings, and had it not been flowing and thrilling despite its problems - It would have gotten an even lower score. Lis Wiehel is a very talented writer, and I feel that the pressure of publishing a second Sparks book in due deadline took the better of her here."}, {"userName": "Carol Boyer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24894451-carol-boyer", "userReview": "The Candidate is a book that has you rushing through the pages, feeling the excitement of news reporter Erica Sparks as she covers the story of Mike Ortiz, leading polls and running for President of the United States and his rich and powerful wife Celeste.. There is more than enough suspense, and drive to keep Erica hot on this story that eerily feels like conspiracy and shocking events that happen to derail her leads.There is a mysterious Chinese woman, Lily who is Celeste's very close friend, and is strangely suspicious in Erica's eyes. Erica's 11 year old daughter Jenny, just wants her mom to spend more time with her and is fearful for her, that something bad will happen but Erica is driven, and her job takes her away one too many times. Erica knows there is something not right with Mike Ortiz, he seems to literally be under his wife's thumb in an inappropriate way and completely devoted to her. Erica digs deep into his capture and imprisonment when Mike was in the military and terrorized by Al Queda, sensing there is a big story that has to be told to the American people who may elect him to become president. Erica meets many folks who might help her, but can they be trusted? And can she trust her own fiance who recently has betrayed her? This book is captivating, although a bit sensational and at times hard to fathom the reality of the very events that happen, it is a fast paced page turner and quite interesting specially given the political climate and media journalism world we live in and read about.

I found the author's style a bit different from that which I am most accustomed but I soon became acclimated to it and from then on the story flowed quite well. Being published by Thomas Nelson. a HarpeCollinns Christian Publishing imprint, I was surprised that there was virtually no element of Christianity. In fact the seductive thoughts of two of the female characters showing a creepy attraction to each other was a major put-off for me. There were not any actual scenes depicting behavior to which Christian audiences would object, but inference was there. The story takes place during an election year in the USA. This is quite appropriate as I completed reading the book on the heels of the current USA Presidential election. The plot begins with the candidate for President with his wife at a rally at which there is a bomb explosion from a backpack squarely in the crowd of onlookers and officials. Several are immediately killed. When this happens and soon after, a successful newscaster, Erica, observes the strange demeanor of Senator Mike Ortiz, one of the presidential candidates, who seems to behave as though he was under the hypnotic control of someone else.A number of events and tragedies occur which make for interesting, exciting, and even fearful reading as one considers, \"Could this really happen\" or \"What if this should happen?\" As the plot unfolds the deep depravity to which individuals could go in pursuit of the presidency is revealed.What takes place? Actions of a female investigative journalist who has earned a position on the national stage. Conspiratorial mind control used by individuals and or internationals. Murderous goals and pursuant actions to achieve high political rank. And a believable presidential campaign rife with unbelievably criminal activities.DISCLOSURE: I received a complimentary copy to facilitate a review of my opinions which are given without compensation."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1179650-cheryl", "userReview": "If you have never tried this author out, this is the perfect time.

Her novels feature relatable characters, an unique mystery that is usually somewhat related to what is going on in the world today. With her newest release, The Candidate, Wiehl really jumps into the mind and playing field of the presidential campaign. The Candidate is a realistic view of what could go on behind the scences, but with a character that I have come to empathize with.The writing is strong and concise. I had no problem following Erica, the heroine and reporter, as she told the story. The subplot was told by Celeste, Mike Ortiz's wife. Mike Ortiz is the presidential candidate the story reveals around. While the tension involves Erica trying to figure out more about Ortiz's background before he became a candidate, the story's tension is much deeper than Erica or I truly imagine. The pace kept me engrossed in the story. I really enjoyed how much research Wiehl put into the story by discovering and making an Al-Qaeda prison come to life. It was a horrible setting to be held hostage in for a couple of months. I cringed as I watched Erica travel through the prison walls in Iraq.As for the characters, I really empathized with Erica. All she has ever wanted to do was be a top-notch reporter, and it appears all her dreams are coming true, but she also wants to be a great mother to her eleven-year-old daughter Jenny. This struggle is real with every working parent in today's culture, so it was easy to come alongside Erica and feel her pain. Wiehl does a good job at delving into the worries and thoughts of Erica as she decides between hunting a new lead or spending time with Jenny. On the other hand, Celeste, the second viewpoint, is a multi-complicated character. She wants higher power and pushes her husband, Mike to reach the pentacle of his career. I had a hard time liking her as a character because she was too \"perfect.\"With this novel published by Thomas Nelson, a leading Christian publishing company, there really wasn't a lot of spiritual elements in the story, so fans of the ABA market could enjoy this book just for the mystery. Fans of James Patterson and J. B Robb might devour The Candidate.A word of caution . . . Wiehl does include a relationship between two women that made me cringe and flip through a number of pages. The perspective of the character had her lusting after the other woman with the other woman responding to that lust. While ABA readers probably won't mind it, but since this book is published by Thomas Nelson, Christian readers will probably turned away by this element of the story. I wouldn't recommend passing this book off to young mystery readers, only mature audiences.The Candidate by Lis Wiehl has a realistic heroine who struggles between motherhood and her career, a mystery that is necessary for today, but there is a scene between two women that really made me want to put the novel down.I received a complimentary copy of The Candidate from Thomas Nelson publishing and the opinions stated are all my own."}, {"userName": "Sharee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11039623-sharee", "userReview": "The Candidate by Lis Weihl and Sebastian Stuart is book two in the Newsmakers Series.

In covering the presidential election campaign, star newsmaker Erica Sparks notices that favored candidate Senator Mike Ortiz seems dependent on his wife to an unnatural degree Celesta Ortiz is a brilliant and glamorous billionaire who, along with her best friend and confidant Lily Lau, has engineered her husband's meteoric rise. The White House is within their reach. But the more Erica investigates the Ortizes' strange relationship, the more intrigued she becomes. Erica begins an investigation but everyone material to her probe ends up dead. With each death, her foreboding grows. Is she next? And can she find out in time if the country's beloved candidate is what he seems, or a threat to national security?So the main character of this book is Erica, an investigative journalist and the majority of the plot seems to be focused around her investigative reporting and is told from her perspective. Although there are a few scenes where the activities of Celeste and Lily are more thoroughly detailed. This book does have a good plot line going and it is well written, it was just a bit slow to me. The book also focuses on how Erica is trying to balance her life; being very dedicated to her work as an investigative journalist but also wanting to be a good parent. Although the book is suspenseful at times, it never really seemed very \"action-packed\" to me and although the synopsis implies that they is quite a bit of violence involved in what seems to become a conspiracy, there really isn't much violence in the book beyond one or two scenes.Like I said, the book is well written, the plot is fairly interesting and Erica's character is fairly well developed, but it just kind of fell flat for me. I never felt like I really got invested in the story. I do believe that fans of the author's previous work will really enjoy this as well as fans of authors such as Clive Cussler or Tom Clancy. I should also note that I did not read the first book in the Newmakers series, although both of the books are marketed as stand alone titles.

The Candidate by Lis Wiehl makes the 2016 presidential campaign we are witnessing look tame\u2014if such a thing is possible.Erica Sparks, who rose to fame as a GNN news star in the thriller, The Newsmakers by Lis Wiehl, has become a well established, well regarded nightly news anchor on the GNN network. She also has custody of her young daughter, Jenny, for the first time since her divorce, and she is struggling to keep it all together. The new President of GNN news is pushing her hard to reach the top spot on the nightly news ratings, and she feels enormous pressure to stay on top.The presidential campaign is in full swing. It is filled with newsworthy aspects; the Republican candidate is a woman senator from Minnesota, and the Democrat is Hispanic from California. Erica's investigative nose for news begins to sniff overtime when she interviews the Democratic candidate Mike Ortiz and his wife Celeste. Something is just not right about that pair. Ortiz seems way too dependent on his wife, and she is just too much in control. And then there is the gorgeous campaign manager, Lily. As Erica begins to put together lengthy features about the two candidates, people start dying all around her, including the young woman she has hired to be her personal assistant to help with child care for her daughter. (By the way, Erica is not much of a mother.) Now concerned about the safety of her daughter, Jenny returns to her father and Erica gets approval from her boss to plunge into the mystery. Erica is more concerned with the story than with her own safety as she travels to Iraq where Ortiz had been held hostage during the Iraq War. While there, she makes a startling discovery that pushes the plot forward at a furious pace to a shocking conclusion at the third presidential debate where Erica serves as the moderator. Despite a lot of inconsistencies (like how many nightly newscasters are such daring investigators), this is a fun read. For all her failings, primarily as a mother, Erica has a great investigative nose and a daring spirit. The plot is contrived but compelling. I knew I wasn't reading great literature. I didn't identify with any of the characters, except for the poor, abandoned daughter, Jenny. And I thought that Erica might be just a little bit too smart for her own good. But\u2014I kept reading.The question I have is one that you probably will ask yourself as you read The Candidate during this month of election frenzy. In an age of media attention to every tiny detail of the presidential candidates, why is Erica Sparks the only one to notice candidate Mike Ortiz's vacant stare and inappropriate smiles? Why did no one else notice Celeste's overbearing nature or her attachment to the campaign manager Lily. At least these impenetrable questions are a delightful diversion from the reality of this year's real-life campaign's craziness.Lis Wiehl is a lawyer but more importantly a news analyst at Fox News. She brings her legal and television experience to her Newsmaker's series of thrillers. The Candidate is the second in the series. I think that this book makes more sense if you read The Newsmakers first."}, {"userName": "Kristi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21034469-kristi", "userReview": "Wow! What an entertaining read from Lis Wiehl. This book was a quick read for me and had me turning pages as fast as I could to find out what would happen next. Politics and the news combine perfectly for an edge of your seat, must-read book.This book made me feel as if I was getting a behind the scenes look in the news world and in the political world. Erika Sparks is a character women can relate to. She is strong yet flawed. She takes her job seriously and wants to be at the top of her field. At the same time she also wants to be the perfect mom to her daughter and the struggle she faces trying to do both jobs is well documented in the story. While I instantly liked Erika, Celeste Ortiz and Lily Lau were characters I immediately didn't care for. The author did a great job of giving each character their own personality that really stood out throughout the book. One character I would have liked to see more of was Josh Walters. I immediately liked him and thought his calm personality was a great balance to Erika's more uptight persona. This book takes place in many different places as Erika follows Mike Ortiz on the political trail. I really felt like I was in all those places. From the streets of New York City to San Francisco, Dubai, and Iraq, I felt like I was a part of this story. There are some really intense scenes that take place in Iraq and they were so well written it was like I was there.I was most impressed with the author's word choices and descriptions. One of my favorite quotes from the book is on page 50, \"Often, the more people try to conceal, the more they reveal.\" This sentence conveys a lot of what will happen in the story and makes the reader stop and think at the same time. Another wonderful description can be found on page 63, \"She's got a pebble in her psychic shoe, and she knows she won't be able to rest until she can shake it out.\" Descriptions such as this made the story so interesting to read. To me this description really lets the reader know how aggravating the thought in her head was to her until she could get it to the forefront of her mind.This book is well-written and has a great flow to it. Several times I planned to read just until the end of the chapter but then the chapter would end with a sentence that made it impossible to put the book down. Lis Wiehl knows how to grab a reader's attention and not let it go.Political junkies, news junkies, and suspense lovers are sure to enjoy this book. Lis Wiehl has now been added to that list of \"must read authors\" I have. In fact, I purchased the first book in this series, The Newsmakers, before I was finished with this one. Don't worry though, this book reads great as a standalone. I can't wait for more Erika Sparks books!I received a free copy of this book from the publisher.

The Candidate is packed with political intrigue and media manipulation as the lust for power turns deadly indeed.It is hard to believe that I would of my own free will choose to read a book about a political election when a) I am so tired of the political commercials on television and b) I am one of the most unpolitical people you would ever meet. I do not talk or debate about candidates or issues. But I was drawn to this book. And knew a short way into it that I was really going to like it. That was when I had the urge to turn to the last chapter to see how it ends. No, I did not turn there.The story was well done and the characters were well developed. There were family tensions to deal with and some subplots to keep it interesting and moving along. I also enjoyed moving around New York City which I personally had recently visited. Being a visual person, I could see the places mentioned in the book. The only disappointment that I experienced was figuring out who the bad guys were before the main character did. I thought it was just a little too obvious where things were heading long before we got there. Still it did not dampen my enjoyment of the book as there were a few twists up until the end.

Mike Ortiz is running for president, but is he ready? His wife seems to be the beautiful, supporting wife, but is she? Erica is an ambitious reporter who thinks something is off about everything. Is she right and how will her investigative reporting affect her and her daughter? Mike Ortiz spent nine months in prison, held by Al-Qaeda, suffering imaginable horrors. As a war hero, he seems to be the perfect candidate to take over the White House, and he believes his wife stands with him completely. But, is Mike standing on his own paving his own way, or is there more to his sudden popularity and appeal? Erica can't let it go. She feels that something is wrong, and like a dog with a bone, can't let it go. How far will she go to uncover the truth, or how far will others go to stop her? All of the answers to these questions and more are found in the pages of this book.Lis Weihl has once again taken a timely topic and put it into a book that will keep readers glued to its pages.

I really like her writing style. The main character was well written. I really liked her tenacity and stubbornness to get things done. The book moves at a really nice pace which can be rare for this genre. It felt a bit over the top at times, though.The book does contain a few swear words and some adult material as well as some pretty detailed violent scenes. It also contains some strange relationships as well. A book definitely for mature audiences. Though it is published by Thomas Nelson, it is not presented as a Christian read by them or Amazon. I'm a bit confused by that.Since the \"bad guys\" are known in the book, this is more a psychological thriller than a mystery.

That in itself is a good enough reason to read this book, especially if that genre is one you enjoy. But I also could relate to the struggle between work and family so accurately portrayed in this book. As a father who had to travel 9 months a year to earn money for his family, I could definitely relate to the tough decisions the main character had to deal with. The feelings I got from reading this were so real that it made me wonder if Ms. Wiehl was writing from experience.\tErica Sparks is that main character to whom I previously referred. An investigative reporter, she is the host of one of the most popular news shows on television. But that fame is a double edged sword. She is frequently required to travel in order to obtain her stories, leaving her 11 year old daughter with baby sitters or interns from the network. Not the ideal situation for either Erica or her daughter Jenny. But Erica is dedicated to her job and believes that the American people and the world deserve the truth. Once she begins a story, Erica will not stop until it is resolved, one way or another. Despite worrying about her daughter constantly, Erica seems to always put her job first, which is hard for Jenny to accept, and maybe rightfully so.\tThe story Erica is working on in this novel has to due with one of the candidates running for president, Mike Ortiz. During the primaries, a bomb takes out Ortiz's main rival, practically handing him the parties nomination. But something about Ortiz doesn't seem quite right to Erica. He is constantly looking to his wife Celeste for approval whenever he is asked a question. He is rarely alone without his wife, and Celeste is constantly with her mentor Lily Lau, who is the daughter of the former Chinese trade minister. Also, Mike Ortiz seems practiced and too smooth in his actions, often giving a smile at inappropriate times. So Erica gets the itch to investigate this man, who is just a heartbeat away from the oval office, as well as his wife. Her search for the truth takes her from New York to San Francisco to Iraq and back. Many witnesses and potential allies conveniently turn up dead, spooking Erica somewhat but making her even more determined to find the truth. All during this time, Jenny is longing for more time with her mother, which tugs strongly at Erica's heart. A tough decision to make, Erica sticks with her story. What she finds is so incredible that it is hard for Erica to fathom and would be disastrous for the United States. But can she live long enough to bring her findings to the world? You will have to read the book in order to find the answer to that question.\tI found the story a compelling read, and as I mentioned earlier tugged at my heart during the interactions between Erica and Jenny. The premise of what Erica found out about Mike Ortiz is a bit far fetched, but Lis Wiehl presents it in such a way as to make it seem possible. The language used by the author is basic and mostly profanity free, so I feel this would be appropriate for middle school children all the way up through adults. In fact, I would encourage adults to let their pre-teens to read this, especially if their jobs require a lot of their time, because I believe Erica accurately portrays the duality of feelings that working adults encounter. A solid 4 star read in my opinion, definitely worth your time. I would like to thank Lis Wiehl, Thomas Nelson, and NetGalley for providing me an ARC of this book. I voluntarily accepted this on a no obligation basis, and did not guarantee a review or that any review would be positive."}, {"userName": "Angie Fehl", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10093055-angie-fehl", "userReview": "3.5 StarsSenator Mike Ortiz is a POW / war hero and presidential candidate. He and wife Celeste seem like the perfect couple -- loving, glamorous, the ultimate power couple. At least on the surface. But just under the surface, the truth is bubbling up. Something seems off. Television journalist Erica Sparks is back on the scene to investigate, determined to bring the truth to light. When we met Erica in the first book of this series, she had recently been given her own news talk show, The Erica Sparks Effect. Wealth and stardom came swift, but now, some time has passed and her boss is pressuring her to keep the ratings up. There are fresh-faced competitors coming onto the scene, but Erica stays strong and mentally regroups. She has a lot riding on this job remaining successful -- her luxury apartment, her daughter's expensive schooling... not to mention just a new found appreciation for the finer, more expensive things Erica's come to develop a taste for. So our girl gets steely-eyed and thinks herself up a winning game plan.Erica nabs the position of moderator on the all important presidential debate between Senator Ortiz and his opponent, Senator Lucy Winters. Set on filming an exclusive mini-interview with Ortiz prior to the debate, but someone else made other plans that day. The crowds at the debate venue are rocked by a bombing, even leaving a few fatalities in the aftermath. Having witnessed the horror firsthand, Erica becomes even more set on uncovering just what is going on. Who was the bomb really meant for? Are Ortiz and his wife behind the attack?As Erica begins to dig further, the story she uncovers begins to grow darker than she ever imagined. Suspecting that some serious damage might have been done to Ortiz's mind during his POW days, she meets with various specialists... who one by one end up either dead or seriously injured. Then come the threats to her family's safety. Now it's not just about the job, but Erica's very survival. It becomes increasingly difficult for her to know who to trust or go to for help. It doesn't always happen this way for me when I'm reading a book, but this one had a very clear breakdown in ratings in my mind: * The character of Erica, I give her a 3. I think I liked her a bit better in the first book. Here, there was just something about her that grated on me. One thing being her frequent phrase of \"say more\". Something about that just bugged me. I prefer \"Do tell\" or \"Go on\". Something about \"say more\" didn't flow as well and just sounded stupid. And then she had other characters doing it! Dialogue once again was an issue for me. I remember in the first book I found it pretty awkward. It's gotten better in this second book but it's still a little off for me. The dialogue often has too much of a scripted sound, the characters sometimes speaking as if they are dictating a letter rather than having a conversation. There's a small portion of the story where actor Robert DeNiro is written in as a character. Even there, I tried reading his lines in his voice and it still didn't seem to ring entirely true (believable) to how you'd expect him to speak. * The plot I give a 4. Solidly good story arc with lots of intrigue and layers. The chapters are also generally pretty short, typically running only 3-4 pages a chapter, which helped keep the pace moving at a nice clip. Overall, good fun!Soooo... I guess this makes this about a 3.5 overall for me!
