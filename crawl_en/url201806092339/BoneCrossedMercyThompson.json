That's not really a criticism from me; when you are in a series for the long haul, it makes sense to take a breather and deal with all the events your characters have faced as well as integrate a feel of the everyday into their lives. At the end of Iron Kissed, there were at least two significant events that needed follow-up and I would have been disappointed in Briggs as a writer and as a woman if she didn't allow her character recovery time.Mercy's attempting to manage her panic attacks when she gets a surprise visit from her mom that unfortunately coincides with a drop-in visit from Stefen, hungry and emaciated. The wolves help Stefen, but it's the first sign that Marsilia, the vampire queen, knows about what happened to Andre in Blood Bound. Mercy's business and the wolves will become targets as well. Strangely, at the same time, a frenemy from college shows up at Mercy's door looking for help dealing with a ghost harassing her son. For the good of all, Mercy decides to travel to Amber's home, with Stefen shadowing her as support in case she runs into the infamous vampire Blackwood.The first time I read this, pacing felt very irregular to me. But that's kind of a bonus, as series tend towards predictable arcs. Still, there's some strange authorial choices--Stefan, Mercy's mom and Amber all showing up at the same time? Peculiar, and the sort of stuff that says \"hello, red herring\" to the reader in an overly dramatic way. The relationship progresses in generally positive ways. Adam gives Mercy more than enough space, except late in the book when he panics. I thought it a nice balancing act of characterization, as it avoids the 'perfect boyfriend/imperfect girlfriend' baloney and shows that Adam makes mistakes as well.Once again, except for surface conversations with frenemy Amber, Mercy has no real female bonding moments. Everyone--and thing--is male. If it's female, it is not a friend. Seriously, Briggs? What's with the authorial choice there? Reading these stories back to back makes it painfully obvious that there's some odd mental schism in the author's world. I think it ended up contributing to me dropping the series, because in between life-threatening events, it's mostly about Mercy's emotions surrounding her male relationships. All that said, Marsilia continues as one of the most fascinating and complex characters, even if she's prefer to see Mercy dead.Three and a half stars, rounding down because... women."}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "Patricia Briggs continues to impress me with her oh-so expressive writing that conveys so much, so economically. I am truly in awe of her talent. Clearly I am very behind on this series. It's not due to a lack of appeal, but due to my reading style and my review reading taking up a lot of my reading time. But I do love knowing that I have a guaranteed read when I reach for one of her books.Mercy is definitely near the top of my list of fictional characters I think I would love to have as a friend in real life. Probably number one, if I'm honest. And not just because she's an excellent and trustworthy mechanic (and I need one of those big time). Mercy is a mix of real-life traits: humble, down-to-earth, courageous (even in the face of fear, which is the true definition of courage), snarky, empathetic, observant, and very self-deprecating. While some readers don't like abuse storylines in their books, I don't mind them when they are done well. Mercy shows so much strength and fortitude of character. Her journey to recovery after her attack in Iron Kissed is realistic and inspiring. I truly love this woman.Briggs writes the kind of fantasy that grabs hold of me and doesn't let go. She plants a garden of what seems like ordinary wildflowers, but exotic blooms that are far from ordinary grow in that garden, waiting to be plucked by a reader. Briggs mixes shapeshifters, werewolves, fae, and vampires in an appealing way that doesn't leave out the inherent menace of all the various supernatural creatures. With a coyote shifter narrator, the reader is fully along for the ride, as Mercy is the first to admit that being a coyote shifter doesn't always give her the advantage, but often puts her in a dangerous situation (while she is more immune to magic than most, she's not impervious.) Oh, and Briggs also throws in ghosts. I must say that I was happy as a clam, since I love fantasy like a house on fire, but I also have an appreciation for old school/classic horror and an old-fashioned ghost story.Can I take the time to gush over the men in Mercy's life?  Adam, Adam, Adam! How I love you. He is perfect for Mercy. And I like that Mercy is starting to see past her emotional wounds and barriers to see him for who he is, her Mate. Also, I love that Adam is so patient and loving about it, even though that is an act of hard-won discipline. He's very possessive, but not in a controlling, irritating way. I love a possessive hero like a house on fire, but I find controlling, dominating men a turnoff. Adam is just right for me. I wish I had an Adam in real life! He's very demonstrative that Mercy is his, but he's not trying to dictate to her every step she takes. He's a true life partner.If there was no Adam in the Mercy Thompson world, then I would definitely be all over Samuel. I still love Samuel, very much. I just don't love him for Mercy's mate. I love him all on his own, and I hope he gets the Mate he needs one day. He's a really cool character. Sweet as pie, but also full of danger that makes the hair stand up on one's neck. He seems serious, but has this mischievous sense of humor. His calm facade hides a wild wolf that might never be tamed.Bran is the Man, or rather, the Alpha of the Alphas (Marrok). He steals a scene, no matter who else is in it. And that's saying something in this series! I know Briggs has said she probably won't write a book with Bran as a main character. I'm sad and understanding of that. He's such a mysterious and compelling figure, when he shows up, it's so satisfying but also tantalizing. I can't love him more. I'm always hungry for more of him.Stefan has actually grown on me quite a bit. While I have become quite a vampire romance fan, I still prefer shifters/weres to vampires, and I like that they take center place in this series. But Stefan adds such a nice touch to this series. While he insists on telling Mercy that he is a 'very bad man', his actions say otherwise. I haven't decided who would play my Stefan, but it would have to be an actor with lots of presence. I liked how Briggs develops Mercy's friendship with Stefan much more in this book (it was more assumed at the beginning). I have to say the vampire storyline makes my heart beat fast and gives me shivers. They are truly menacing creatures.The thing with Briggs is that no character is a throwaway. Each one is carefully developed, even for their short presence in this book. You feel everything even in a short scene that you should feel. And while the characters might throw you for a loop at first, their motivations are apparent as the layers peel away.I think that for the short length of this book, it's really a full meal. Urban fantasy for the true lover of the genre. Also, I think a good gateway to those who are investigating this genre for the first time. Mercy by herself is enough to keep a reader hooked. But the secondary characters, the plotting and storyline will have the reader staying for seconds and dessert.Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "Final review, first posted on www.FantasyLiterature.com:Mercy Thompson, a part-Native American coyote shapeshifter or walker, and full-time mechanic, is still dealing with the emotional aftermath of events in Iron Kissed, but at least she and the local werewolf Alpha, Adam, are on the right track now. Unfortunately for them, their relationship plans promptly get interrupted: Marsilia, the mistress of the local vampire clan or \u201cseethe\u201d (I love that word), has found out that Mercy acted contrary to her orders in Blood Bound and is out now for Mercy\u2019s blood, quite literally. Marsilia has a set of crossed bones painted on Mercy\u2019s garage door (in magical, non-removable paint) that tells the supernatural world Mercy is a marked woman and free game. All in all, it\u2019s a good time for Mercy to leave town for a few days while her werewolf friends try to negotiate a peaceful resolution with the vampires.  So when Mercy\u2019s old college friend, Amber, turns up on her doorstep asking for her to come visit and help with a ghost that\u2019s haunting her Spokane home, it seems like a heaven-sent opportunity. With all of Mercy\u2019s current issues with vampires, it seems Mercy and Adam to be helpful that there\u2019s only one vampire in the entire city of Spokane, one Jim Blackwood. Surely Mercy won\u2019t come to Blackwood\u2019s notice? But in reality, it\u2019s out of the frying pan and into the fire. This fourth book in the MERCY THOMPSON series is my favorite one yet, with tight, intense plotting and an imaginative story line that deftly mixes together ghosts, vampire conspiracies and power games, and fae artifacts all playing role in the plot, along with Mercy\u2019s developing relationship with the long-suffering Adam. Despite all of these competing elements, the plot never gets confusing. Patricia Briggs manages to blend these elements together in a way that not only makes sense but is deeply satisfying.It\u2019s a particular strength in this series that Mercy \u2015 as well as other characters \u2015 don\u2019t get to simply dance through life without paying the fiddler. Emotional and psychological problems aren\u2019t simply resolved within a week, wrapped up with a neat bow and put away forever. In fact, one major issue that I had with Iron Kissed, that the ending too easily smoothed over a weighty personal issue of Mercy\u2019s, was resolved by the beginning of Bone Crossed, which casts that scene in a different light as the story continues from that same point. One of the reasons the MERCY THOMPSON series is so appealing to me is the way that Briggs pulls in plot threads from prior books in the series. Time and again, unforeseen consequences and fallout from incidents in previous books in the series resurface, as it becomes apparent that not only are there some loose ends from the past, but they\u2019re creating quite a tangle for Mercy and her friends. Mercy is dealing with the second and third order effects of her past actions, which is fantastic writing as far as I\u2019m concerned. Similarly, characters and iconic items that the reader is already familiar with, like a particular fae walking stick, reemerge to affect Mercy\u2019s life in new ways. For example, her ability to see ghosts, which was previously a key element in Blood Bound, becomes relevant once again as she attempts to help her old friend Amber with a worrisome haunt, and then further develops into an integral part of Mercy\u2019s ongoing story. Either Briggs has plotted out this series extremely carefully, or she\u2019s particularly gifted at reexamining prior books\u2019 plots and finding intriguing ways to carry incidents, characters and themes forward. In either case, it all feels very organic and natural, helping to create an unusual feeling of realism in this urban fantasy world.After thinking about this some more, I'm upping my rating from 4 stars to 5. This book, and the series, deserves it."}, {"userName": "samantha  (books-are-my-life20)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27251572-samantha-books-are-my-life20", "userReview": "Great PNR series.

Patricia Briggs latest Mercy Thompson novel \"Bone Crossed\" kept me on the edge of my seat, furiously reading to find out what happened next! There's good news and bad news in Mercy's latest adventure and just when you think things will settle down, BAM, there's someone new looking to mess with Mercy's peace.Mercy is still recovering from her brutal rape at the hands of a fae 'possessed' wacko. Mercy managed to kill the b^%tard, but it will be a while before the psychological scars heal, if ever. The good news is that she's finally decided to mate with Adam. The bad news is she's not sure how long it will take before she can get close to him without a panic attack. The good news is he's willing to wait and help her recover. The bad news is her friend Stefan the vampire appears suddenly and close to real death, just having time to say \"She knows\". That means the vampire Queen is aware that Mercy managed to kill not one, but two of her creatures...and now she wants Mercy's blood, and not just for a snack.I think my heart rate is still elevated after this one. I have to rate this series as one of my absolute fave fantasies, right up there with Hamilton and Ward. The difference with Briggs is that I let my sons read these stories (PG fating)! A strong heroine, shapeshifters, fae (they're NOT the fae from your childhood stories either), vampires, creatures of lore, and a pagan god or two make their way into Briggs' stories and Mercy's world...and it all flows together smooth as silk.

But this re-read was different for me. It was stronger here. I appreciated the villain, and the story, and everything that was happening. Mercy needed this time, needed this moment - especially after the events of the last book. And - even though this is one of the worst villains she's faced yet - it was, to me, a welcome reprieve after the heart-wrenching moments in the last book. Not that there aren't plenty of them here. After all, one doesn't heal immediately from the events at the end of Iron Kissed.Even though Mercy spends some time away from the Tri-Cities, we get plenty of development with her relationships - with everyone. And I love that.Original Review:Mercy's barely a week out from the tragic events that happened at the end of Iron Kissed when Stefan pops in at her feet, a blackened husk, whispering \"She knows.\"With vampires stalking her steps and pressing vague attacks on the werewolves in her life, Mercy decides to take a trip to help a friend with a ghost. Of course, it just couldn't be that simple and Mercy finds herself in a much scarier predicament.Not quite as good as Blood Bound and Iron Kissed, but still a pretty solid read. The \"mystery\" story-line wasn't as appealing to me, but there's so much development with the characters (Mercy and Adam in particular, with quite a bit from Stefan) that I can't help but enjoy this every time."}, {"userName": "Felicia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/666892-felicia", "userReview": "I really liked this book, this series gets better and better actually.

This is definitely one of my all time favorite series and I honestly believe that everyone who hasn't read these books yet should run to the bookstore right away and buy them up. This is the fourth book in the Mercy Thompson series and it picks up right after the events of the previous book. It is really important that this series be read in order since some of the events are carried over from the previous book. I really had a lot of fun with this audiobook.On major focus of this Adam and Mercy's relationship. They both really do care for each other and want to make things work. I like how carefully they are with each other. Mercy is a mess after the horrible events of the previous book and Adam is there for her. He really wants to help with her pain and if he could I am sure he would take it away. The mystery in the story is centered around vampires. I like the vampires in this world so that works out well for me. The local vampires have painted crossed bones on the door at her garage and she decides it would be a good idea to get out of town for a bit. Her friend from college has a little problem with a ghost so Mercy goes to help...and runs into more than she bargained for. Stefan plays a large role in this book and really proved how much he cares for Mercy as well.I love Lorelei King's narration of this series. I am amazed by how well she voices all of these characters and keeps things consistent from book to book. The emotional aspects of the story really come through during her narration. I was able to listen to this book for hours at a time largely due to her wonderful delivery of this story. Lorelei King is quickly becoming one of my favorite narrators. I would highly recommend this series to other. This was my second time experiencing this book and I hope to read it again in the future. It is really that good.

After the horrible and devastating experiences Mercy had in the last book, the author decided that she, as well as us, the readers, need a bit of recovery and regrouping time. She does that by slowing the pace a bit and letting Mercy and the wolfs work on developing their relationship. She also found a way to intensify Stephan's connection with the little coyote (poor vampire had to go through real torture courtesy of the vamp mistress), and the magic walking stick kept cuddling up with her every chance it got and followed her about like a pup. The focus of the story this time was on Mercy getting over the emotional trauma, which had left her with paralyzing panic attacks at random moments and her almost aversion to touch... It is also sad how helpless she feels every time another one of her always powerful enemies takes away her will, thus re-traumatising her over and over!!! Who would not start doubting their strength and sanity under such circumstances??? But her weaknesses are what makes us root for her and her ability to dust herself off and despite her fears, get herself up and fighting again, are what makes her our hero... Reading this was not as easy and engaging as the previous book, but it was layered with characters, feelings and situations with which I am sure the author is laying the foundation for the stories to come. I am aflutter with anticipation and having all the published volumes of the series, I am jumping into the next at once!

First let me state how appalled I am by the fact that Briggs allowed her rapped heroine to have sex only a week after her rape. WTF? Second, Briggs wrote far too many inconsistencies for me to believe that Mercy was either traumatized or healing from her rape. One minute she is having panic attacks, the next she is wagging her bare ass at her dull lover as he looks on from across the room. Again I ask, WTF? And further shame to Briggs for dragging out a sex scene between Adam and Mercy for four books, only to have it fade to black. At least own it if you are going to include it. Christ.

Having not read the first three books the first time, I was completely lost to what was happening. I didn\u2019t feel attached to Mercy\u2019s character and didn\u2019t find the romance engaging. This time around though, everything was in perspective and I found that this book was a lot \u201clighter\u201d in terms of the banter between characters. Briggs really kicked up the humour in this book! I found myself stupidly smiling at the teasing between Mercy and the werewolves and I noticed that Mercy\u2019s got a smart mouth in this one! This line was particularly funny:  There was even a \u201cHo, ho, ho,\u201d if you skipped around a little and deleted an \u201ce\u201d on the last \u201cho\u201d. Our green painter had a limited vocabulary and occasionally mixed up a professional working woman with a garden implement.  Har har!One thing that\u2019s different about this series is that the vampires don\u2019t give off \u201cfuck me\u201d pheromones. Instead, they\u2019re scary as hell, which is just as effective as keeping readers on their toes. James Blackwood creeps me out and the ending with the ghosts and zombie thing just wasn\u2019t for me. Yuck!But the biggest thing about this book is probably the relationship between Mercy and Adam. While they aren\u2019t going at it like rabbits, there\u2019s still one scene that is particularly memorable. There\u2019s something unique about Briggs\u2019 writing because even though she holds off on the sex, people still read it! That to me is a testament to her writing skill. There\u2019s so much more to Mercy and her world than just her relationships. And it\u2019s a world I\u2019d love to read more of.Favourite Quote:\u201cJust like Medea,\u201d he murmured. \u201cAll I have to do is put my hands on you.

So often, once a choice is made, the sexual tension drains out of a series and it becomes less interesting. I will be interested to see how Briggs maintains the forward momentum.Also of interest, Mercy continues to discover the special powers of a skinwalker that make her anathema to the mainstream vamps. She is extremely fortunate to have Stefan as a friend & protector and I hope this means that he will continue to appear in future volumes.I still maintain that Mercy needs some women friends, and not like her friend Amber who shows up in this installment.

The emotional intensity of the earlier books is missing here, particularly in Mercy's interaction with Stefan. The book is too short and too crowded with characters for the author to spend enough time on any one of them. It reminded me a little of a Laurell Hamilton book, which is not a good thing.The first third of the novel has an almost frantic level of activity, but the pace thankfully slows after that and the story begins to have more of the feel of the previous Mercy books.

To say that Marsilia is unhappy is an understatement. Stephan has been thrown out of the seethe for helping keep Mercy's secret & Marsilia wants blood - preferably Mercy's but she is happy to target her friends too. With Adam & Samuel determined to keep her safe it looks like this could be the start of a war between the werewolves and the vampires. When Mercy's friend from college Amber turns up asking for Mercy's help dealing with a ghost everyone thinks this would be the perfect way to get Mercy out of Marsilia's reach. But nothing is as it seems and Mercy soon finds she has jumped out of the frying pan straight into the fire.I'm a big fan of Patricia Briggs and love the Mercy Thompson series so was really looking forward to reading Bone Crossed & I wasn't disappointed. I love Mercy and was devastated for her at the end of the last book so I really wanted to know how she was getting on. A week after the ending of Iron Kissed Mercy is in a mess both emotionally and physically, suffering regularly from panic attacks and flashbacks of the event. She knows she loves Adam but she is finding it hard to allow him to get close to her and I felt her reactions were very realistic considering what she has been through. I've always had a soft spot for Adam but he is so patient and caring towards Mercy in this book that I couldn't help liking him even more. He understands what she is going through and is determined to help her recover.Spending time in Mercy's world is like visiting with friends and I always find myself easily slipping into her world like I never left. I love each of the characters in their own ways and even the more minor characters like Jesse and Warren are so well rounded that it feels like you actually know them. If I had one minor disappointment it was that I would have liked to have spent a little more time with Stephan in this installment of the series, especially as the main plot revolves around the vampires. He suffers so much in Bone Crossed and I hope we get to see how he deals with the things Marsilia has done over the next few books. We didn't see that much of Samuel either but that was more understandable considering the plot but we get to see a lot of Adam so that makes up for it!If you're yet to discover the Mercy Thompson series then I would highly recommend it to urban fantasy fans. It is one of my favorite series and Mercy is a fantastic heroine. Although you could probably read this as a stand alone novel I would strongly recommend reading the series in order so you don't miss any of the back story. If you're already a fan of the series & haven't already read Bone Crossed what are you waiting for? This was probably my favorite book in the series so far so I'm sure you're going to enjoy it!___________________________________2nd ReadBuddy reread with AngeNo time to write another review - must carry on reading the series :o) You'll have to read the old one if you want to know more!___________________________________3rd ReadBuddy read with AngeSince it's been nearly 2 years since Ange & I buddy read this series last we decided we're well overdue another read in the run up to the release of Fire Touched next March.I love this series so much! The characters, the world building just everything about these books makes them a comfort read for me. Along with Ilona Andrews's Kate Daniels series this is probably my most reread series & I never get tired of it.___________________________________4th ReadMercy has such a knack for getting herself in trouble that it's impressive really. I think Adam sums it up perfectly in one sentence \u201cOnly you could go to Spokane and get bitten by the one vampire in the whole city.\u201d Bloody vampires can never be trusted, especially not around our favourite trouble magnet but it makes for fun reading!"}, {"userName": "Cyna", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4171731-cyna", "userReview": "This is the first book where we get the dual-plotline format, presumably because Briggs liked both concepts but couldn't figure out a way to stretch them both out into book length. It's strange to have one plot advertised on the cover, and then have a completely different one make up most of the book, especially when there is nothing tying the two together, except Mercy. It must suck to have two super powerful bad guys plotting against you at the exact same time.There\u2019s nothing particularly memorable about Bone Crossed. Mercy is done wavering between men and has basically settled into a relationship with Adam. She is done fighting for her independence, and just accepts all the decisions that Adam makes for her where she would have at least argued one or two books ago. Because we\u2019ve seen what happens when Mercy makes decisions for her self. It just really seems that in this book Mercy is broken. This is understandable after having been raped, but we feel that she allows to much of her self to be lost and stops fighting for the normal, uncomplicated life that she wanted to build. Instead she throws herself head first into the werewolf society she\u2019d previously decided against by becoming a member of a pack and the Alpha\u2019s mate.The manner in which Adam makes Marcy pack is probably our biggest issue with this book, and the best example of Mercy\u2019s transformation. Having taken Stefan\u2019s blood in Blood Bound, Mercy still has a psychic connection to him, and feels his despair upon learning that his flock has been wiped out. This triggers a panic attack in Mercy, while she is with Adam. Adam realizes why she is panicking, and without giving Mercy a choice, performs the ceremony that makes her pack, which breaks the connection to Stefan. He then states, \u201cHe can\u2019t have you. Not now. Not ever. I don\u2019t owe him that.\u201dAfter calming down, Adam rightly feels that he did wrong, and should be berated for his presumption. But the new, improved Mercy is not angry. Instead, she says this: \u201cThank you, Adam [...] Thank you for tearing Tim into small Tim bits. Thank you for forcing me to drink one last cup of fairy bug-juice so i could have use of both of my arms. Thank you for being there, for putting up with me. Thank you for keeping me from being another one of Stefan\u2019s sheep-I\u2019ll take pack over that any day. Thank you for making the tough calls, for giving me time. Thank you for loving me.\"WHY THANK YOU ADAM FOR MAKING ALL MY FUCKING DECISIONS FOR ME.This is how much Mercy has changed. Adam flat-out admits that he made her pack because he didn\u2019t want her to have a connection with someone else (possessive much?). Even Adam realizes that this was overstepping his bounds. But Mercy thanks him. WHAT THE HELL! SHE THANKS HIM. This is another step in the breaking down of Mercy Thompson. Where previously she would have been livid and argued, she has now accepted that her man Adam knows what\u2019s best for her.It\u2019s worth noting that Mercy\u2019s only real act of independence in this book is to decide who to subjugate herself to, Stefan or the big bad, Blackwood.

This installment sees Mercy tangle with a few ghosts and more vampires -- the vampires in particular are melodramatic and long-winded. I very much enjoyed meeting Chad; it's so rare to find deaf characters. The ghosts and fae were my favorite parts (especially that oak tree). I'm definitely more invested in the Alpha & Omega series (which still floors me bc PNR is NOT my thing and A&O is certainly more lovey-dovey than Mercy). Otherwise I'll wait for a Warren & Kyle spinoff because I heart them so much.

Since he is my favorite character in the series, I seriously missed him in the last book. And, he is better than ever. \n\"Want to explain to the kid that I'm more a Spike than a Buffy? A villain, not a superhero?\"I batted my eyelashes at him. \"You're my hero.\"...\"I'm no one's hero, Mercy.\"I turned my face until I was looking directly at Chad. \"Do you think that means I won't get to see him in spandex?\"... Chad made a yuck face.\"hey,\" I told them, \"watching good-looking men run around in tight-fitting costumes is high on my list of things I'd like to do before I die.\"\n\nyeah, me too...So, in this book, we have Mercy dealing with the aftermath of her attack in the last book. She has panic attacks and flashbacks, but still, I would say that it would have been much better to just not have the whole rape thing in the storyline because I feel like it is way too light to be respectful of real rape victims. As a matter of fact, let me just state that I would be happy if there were no rape scenes at all. In real life or books.The story in this book goes back to the vampires with Marsilia going after Mercy and marking her for death with a skull and crossbones type of thing on her door. This propels Mercy in to leaving town, right in to the clutches of a whole new set of problems - and things that want to kill her. This girl has a hella lot of creatures that want to kill her!I liked the overall plotline, but mostly liked Stefan in the book, along with the little boy.

I can't really say anything different about Bone Crossed that I have about the other books in the series. Mercy is now a firmly one of my favourite heroines, the plot was interesting and kept me guessing and Adam was wicked hot.

The third book did such a terrible job with the aftermath of rape (OMG I have been raped and am therefore unworthy of my boyfriend's love!), and I thought I was done. This book walks back the very worst of the last book, then wanders along through your standard issue urban fantasy plot, with extra werewolf mating. It would be unexceptionable, if only Briggs didn't keep trying to have, you know, issues. Mercy's PTSD appears to consist entirely of panic attacks neatly timed to further the plot or so her boyfriend can comfort her. No cycling mood, change in sleep patterns, fixation on details of the assault, or you know any other actual realistic symptoms. Briggs could have done better by spending three minutes with the DSM-IV. I am done patting authors on the back for remembering to include the effects of trauma at all -- now try doing it better.Oh, and did I mention there's a deaf boy in this book? He's very brave, you know, and also apparently an Olympic champion lip reader, because the kid is better at it than any deaf person that I've ever met (which is a lot, by the way). The real problem with this series is that on the surface it's fine. There's nothing egregiously wrong with this book like there was the last one, and in fact a few aspects of the kid's disability are handled very nicely in that there's no actual fuss about it. But the shallowness with which she approaches things I care about a great deal is actually more infuriating than complete wrongheadedness can be.Dude.

Mercy has always felt like she was on the outside looking in and alone. Raised by the wolves she was still never part of the pack, little did she know how important she was to Bran the Alpha of all Alphas. When she accepted Adam as her mate she never really knew what that would mean. Now that she is part of the pack it isn\u2019t really what she expected it to be. It is hard to have people in your head when you have felt alone most of your life.Marsila has figured out that Mercy had something to do with the death of her demon raising vampire and is out to get her. But since Mercy is now protected by the pack Marsila has to find a new way to punish her. In an effort to help her pack and an old college friend, she heads out of town to help with a ghost problem. Stefan tags along to look after her while Adam sorts out the problems with Marsila. But it seems that the only vampire in town there might have other plans for her.\n\u201cOnly you could go to Spokane and get bitten by the one vampire in the whole city.\u201d\nMercy, Mercy, Mercy you find trouble in the darnedest places, it seems Adam can\u2019t let you out of his sight for a minute. It was only supposed to be a ghost problem but it seems that the ghost that is haunting a little boy is more than Mercy planned for.I always like that the Mercy Thompson books are always more than they seem. There are a few layers to everything that is going on. This one in particular was interesting because there was the Vampire in Spokane that wants something from Mercy as well as Marsila and her political maneuverings that involve Stefan. Marsila is crafty and vengeful to say the least. The storyline was well thought out and there were quite a few instances that I was worried for characters. Other than that I like all the side things that are going on that may or may not come into play later. There is the walking stick that seems to like Mercy and follows her around, her cat that likes vampires, werewolves and coyotes, a book on fae and Mercy\u2019s ability to find trouble around every corner.I was happy to see more of Stefan he is one of my favorite characters, he is the Spike (everyone should know who that is) of the series.\n\u201cThat\u2019s a pretty lame superhero name,\u201d I told him.\u201cScooby-Doo is already taken,\u201d he said with dignity. \u201cAnything else sounds lame in comparison.\u201d\n He is the Vampire who doesn\u2019t really have a heart of gold but\u2026..he is better than most.
