I discovered the Edie Spence series entirely by accident, really enjoyed Nightshifted, the first book, and now I\u2019m happy to report that the second book didn\u2019t diminish my love for it in the least.I think what people like most about Edie is that she\u2019s just a regular woman, very non-heroic and plain. She works her night shifts at the hospital, gets conned over and over by her addict brother and pushed around by the supernatural community. She has no lasting relationship, no real friends, and her bond with her family is tenuous at best. One can\u2019t help but feel compassion for Edie and her sad, quiet life, but there are times when she seems just a bit too passive. I like reading about regular people in unusual circumstances, and I don\u2019t necessarily want them to be fearless or heroic, but resourceful would be nice. Edie is often just a pushover, for her brother, her co-workers, the mysterious Shadows and the entire supernatural community, especially the vampires. She gets involved in their business in very odd ways, they get her to do their dirty work with just two words of flattery and then keep her in the dark and fail to protect her from things they brought to her doorstep. \nI pulled on my scrubs and all the silver that I currently owned. Between my belt, bracelet, and badge \u2013 which might warn me a second or two before any attack \u2013I\u2019d give myself even odds on surviving for five seconds once I was outside my door. Five whole seconds, although not necessarily painless ones.\n In Nightshifted, Edie took it upon herself to save a vampire child, and now that vampire child, Anna, asks her to be some kind of Ambassador, involves her in things Edie doesn\u2019t even begin to understand, and then just disappears without protecting her in any way. There were times when I wanted to yell at Edie to grow a spine, but there would be no point. She is who she is.\n\"You can't just leave anyone. It's one of your biggest virtues, and one of your worst flaws.\nEdie is constantly surrounded by grotesque creatures she relentlessly takes care of, even when it\u2019s not her job to do so. As I said in my opening paragraph, I love it when urban fantasy flirts with horror, and Cassie Alexander balances the fine line between the two wonderfully. Sure, some of the descriptions might turn your stomach (they did mine, and I\u2019m not exactly a delicate flower), but this is what sets the series apart and I really like it.At this point, I\u2019d hate for Edie to find a steady relationship and then get her act together and become less pathetic (harsh words, Maja, harsh!). I don\u2019t want a man to fix her life, that would be even more pathetic. I want her to find her own footing, start taking care of herself and then maybe get into a serious relationship, preferably with Asher. I like Asher for her, and I have a feeling he wouldn\u2019t just abandon her like Ty (although he did give me reason to think otherwise). He\u2019s charming and attractive and, you know, definitely NOT a zombie. I\u2019ll keep my fingers crossed. What I really wanted, but didn\u2019t get from Moonshifted was a stronger story. The first half was essentially plotless, or at the very least directionless. So many things were happening at once, and at the same time, nothing was happening at all. I still couldn\u2019t clearly outline the plot for you, nor do I wish to try. For the first 80%, Moonshifted suffered from the worst case of Second Book Syndrome I\u2019ve ever seen, but at least it ended with a bang. Hopefully, the next book, Shapeshifted, will be a bit more exciting in that regard."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50378-angie", "userReview": "Originally reviewed here @ Angieville.You'll remember my excitement upon discovering Cassie Alexander and Nightshifted--her fabulous urban fantasy debut. I loved everything about it, from the killer cover to the hard-working, conflicted protagonist inside. When I realized the sequel was set to be published just a few months later I was, well, over the moon. Go on. Raise your hands. I know I'm not the only one who waits (with barely concealed ill grace) a year for each new installment in her favorite series. It can be a hard wait. I understand why, and I am nothing if not extremely grateful for everything that goes into the writing and publishing processes. But it can be a hard wait. That's why two in one year? Such a treat. That said, the closing events of Nightshifted were portentous to say the least. And I was pretty anxious about where Edie would be (and in what condition) when I found her next, who would be around to help her, and who . . . would not.Edie Spence isn't fresh off the shelf on the Y4 ward of her county hospital anymore. She's earned her stripes and is even approaching tenuous friendships with her fellow seasoned nurses. It's been months now since her cringe-worthy induction into life as a nurse for the undead (and every other supernatural creature that comes their way) and Edie is still rattled by the fallout. Indebted to powers she'd really rather not name and struggling to define her unwanted role in local vampire politics, she's less than pleased to find herself holding vigil over a werewolf alpha in a coma. Edie was on the scene when he was attacked and soon every wolf in the pack is banging down her door looking for clues. This includes a wolf by the name of Lucas who stands to inherit the alpha mantle should the old man not pull through. Lucas is a bundle of contradictions and Edie is 99.9% sure she should keep her distance. But when her home is attacked and the vampires become involved, there is little she can do to stay removed from the action.Edie is nobody's fool and I love her for that. With the possible exception of her brother, she has very few blind spots. She does her best to avoid disaster scenarios. She really does. Unfortunately, her world has teeth and seems to be supremely uninterested in cutting her a break. That's not to say that she's without her share of foibles. But even when she's making a clear mistake, she remains fully cognizant that it is her choice and that she is making it. Usually to fend off something even darker, for which I can rarely fault her even as it fills me with concern for her and the bleakness that surrounds her. Edie is flawed and lonely and allergic to asking for help for herself and I am incredibly fond of her. Witness a couple of reasons why (taken from my uncorrected ARC):\"I introduced him to my parents, Edie. I thought he was the one.\"I didn't know what to say. I didn't think I'd ever felt like that. I'd stood on the edge of The Oneness before, and maybe peeked into the valley below, but I'd never made the final jump. I'd learned that if you thought of people as disposable, it hurt less when they disposed of you.Her heartrending frankness hits me every time.Asher met me at the door, looking like the Asher I knew best. Olive skin, dark hair, dark brown eyes. He took one look at me, and then past me at Gina, still slumped over in my passenger seat. \"You want to put her in a spare room, or a spare bathroom?\"\"Someplace with a lot of tile.\"He followed me out to my car, and we retrieved her. Gina kept murmuring things that sounded sad, while Asher helped me help her down his entry hall. We made it up the stairs together, and I arranged her inside a claw-foot tub while Asher went to get extra towels. I sat on the toilet beside her, petting her hair, and Asher returned to lean against the wall.\"Do I want to know what happened?\"\"Girl meets were-bear, girl falls for were-bear, were-bear says if you love me you'll let me bite you, girls says good-bye.\" I wished I had an IV start kit and a banana bag--IV fluids with vitamins and minerals--right about then. We could've set her impending hangover straight in no time.Asher's eyebrows rose high up his forehead. \"I meant at your house.\"Alexander graces this novel with the perfect amount of humor and horror. Edie's life is awash in gray. Worn down by her relentless job, her succubus of a brother, and the demands of the paranormal, she's acutely wary of any scraps of happiness that float her way. I understand her caution, especially given how she's been burned in the past. But I can't help but hope for her, too. I enjoyed her interactions with the her fellow nurses (Gina in particular) and the local weres (Lucas in particular) immensely. And her encounters with the elusive Asher fill me with alternating glee and uncertainty. I choose to view these tentative forays as harbingers of the hope she deserves. My concerns and hopes aside, MOONSHIFTED absolutely shone in the sequel department, extending my affection for the characters, while introducing new angles to sink my teeth into. It also possesses one humdinger of a climax. I was swept away in the force with which it built and the raging rush to the finish. I'm more attached to Edie than ever. This is urban fantasy of the highest order. However will I survive the wait for book three?"}, {"userName": "Rachel the Book Harlot", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4702450-rachel-the-book-harlot", "userReview": "3.75 stars"}, {"userName": "Kara-karina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5427067-kara-karina", "userReview": "4.5/5Despite oh so very deceiving synopsis, Moonshifted is not about choosing sides or men. Just like Nightshifted, it is a constant attempt of one lonely human with a big heart to survive among scary supernatural forces. That's it.Nurse Edie doesn't have any superpowers, she is not particularly pretty, especially working night shifts (Edie, I know how you feel. I don't like the look of myself in the mirror after a week of night shifts too) and she doesn't have awesome powers of deduction. In other words, she is normal just like us. An overworked, young health worker with no life and desire to help at the most unfortunate moments.Edie barely escaped a vampire trial in Nightshifted, and she gets right in the middle of werewolf power games when a truck hits a werewolf king of her city. On the other hand her vampire friend Anna asks her a big favour and Edie can't refuse little girl she saved once before...Now vampires hustle her and some odd zombie-like werewolves are trying to eat her, and she is tired of being the one who solves all the mysteries, and it's Christmas and her sofa has bad blood spots on it, and her parents are coming for dinner. It's too much, it's too dangerous, and again she is way over her head...I love that I felt for Edie so much, that the author could make us feel her constant fatigue, desperation and desire to just get it over with and have some sleep.Moonshifted is a better, stronger book than Nightshifted. Edie carves her own way, not necessarily traditional for urban fantasy heroines but that's what so good about this series. You really don't know what awaits around the corner.

Her heart is still smarting after her lover, Ti, takes off to who knows where. So yeah, Edie\u2019s not in a great place, but when she witnesses a hit and run right in front of her hospital, she has little time to think about herself when she\u2019s trying to keep a man from bleeding out in the street. Soon, Edie finds out that the victim is the alpha of the local werewolf pack, and now the pack is in turmoil. If he doesn\u2019t survive, all hell could break loose. Edie has also been asked to be Anna the vampire\u2019s Ambassador of the Sun, which Anna insists is only a ceremonial role, and only for one night, but Edie is dubious. She can hardly say no, but it doesn\u2019t mean she won\u2019t dread it. Oh, did I mention Dren shows up claiming Edie owes him for the loss of his hand and takes to following her? It doesn\u2019t stop there, guys. The hits just keep coming for Edie. Asher, shapeshifter and former lover, comes back into her life, there\u2019s a hot werewolf that\u2019s paying lots of attention to her, vampire and werewolf wars, then there\u2019s the whole matter of Gideon, Anna\u2019s protector, which is kind of a gross/awesome/wonderful highlight of the book. Trust me on this one. If I tell you (and I so want to tell you), it will ruin it, but you\u2019ll love it. Oh, and she has to do Christmas with her family, including her addict brother. See? Told you Edie had a full plate!I was delighted with Nightshifted but I was kind of blown away by Moonshifted. Cassie Alexander has brought the awesome with a layered narrative that positively crackles with tension. Edie is tough, but she doesn\u2019t seem to know it, which is what I love about her, and I keep hoping she\u2019ll find someone to make her happy, but hers is not an easy life, and she certainly doesn\u2019t have an easy job. In short, her life is not all that conducive to romance, but like I said, I remain very hopeful. You\u2019ll meet old favorites from Nightshifted and some new ones that are wonderful and you\u2019ll be left with a pretty jaw-dropping ending. The author not only takes urban fantasy to new and exciting places, but she also adds in horror and even SF elements that make this series even more unique. My review of Shapeshifted is coming up soon, and if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll want to move right on to it after finishing Moonshifted. You won\u2019t be disappointed. This is one of my favorite new UF series, and a standout in a somewhat saturated genre.

This book is totally different from the first one and if she's working towards so overall goal it's not apparent at this point. Oh, there are overall themes--weres hate vampires, vampires hate weres, shadows are assholes, etc., but there's not some great unification objective or something.In fact, Edie has no super powers whatsoever. That's right, in a world of supernatural creatures, Edie Spence is not a supernatural. She's H-U-M-A-N. She's had some brushes with changeover type situations, but none of them stick.In addition to being human and still sassy, she's quirky and hilarious. Whether she's talking about snozzberries tasting like snozzberries or Grandfather blacksmithing himself a cyborg, she doesn't make me cackle, but she's got \"wry grin\" down.Speaking of Grandfather, he might just be one of my all-time favorite secondary characters. He's kind of like a no-english speaking poltergeist version of Zee (Siebold Adelbertsmiter). So yeah. The ending would have ticked me off if the next book wasn't already out, but it is, so I'm not gonna complain. All Edie needs now is a steady guy and a definitive mission."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4096145-sarah", "userReview": "4.5 stars - Even better than the first!{This review was originally published on Clear Eyes, Full Shelves.}Cassie Alexander's debut novel, Nightshifted, was one of the more memorable and creative urban fantasies I've read in a long time. Needless to say, I was thrilled to get my hands on an early copy of Moonshifted, Nightshifted's fast-paced and riveting sequel.[Note: I have made every attempt to avoid spoilers for Nightshifted. Read my review of that book Read my review of that book here.]Moonshifted picks up shortly after the events of Nightshifted, in which nurse Edie Spence finds herself embroiled in a terrifying battle with supernatural creatures, barely escaping with her life. Edie is still a nurse on Y4, the secret ward for paranormal beings of all sorts, as part of a deal to save her brother from addiction. She's still broke, she's still lonely and she's still self-destructive. The only thing that's changed is that she's started to form connections with her follow Y4 indentured health care workers, all of whom have a story about why they're trapped in a dead end job caring for the paranormal.Floor Y4 catered to the supernatural creatures that no one else knew about: werecreatures in their mortal phases, the daytime servants of the vampires, the sanctioned donors of the vampires, and shapeshifters that occasionally went insane. And sometimes zombies, whom nurses occasionally dated, with poor outcomes. At the thought of my now twice-dead love life, my urge to make small talk chilled.While on her lunch break with one of those co-workers, Edie witnesses a man being struck by a hit and run driver. Except the man isn't actually a human--he's a werewolf. Edie and her coworker save the werewolf, but it lands her in the position of caring for the werewolf who's in a coma on Y4. Meanwhile, in the midst of this, Edie's also roped into further involvement with Anna, the teenager vampire she saved in the previous novel. It's not long before the injured man's werewolf pack descends on the ward and Edie finds herself entangled in an internal conflict within the pack, and with her interesting piqued by Lucas, who is in line to becoem pack leader, should Edie's patient die.Edie tries to remain level-headed within the chaos swirling around her, but once her apartment is ransacked by vampires, she has no choice by to align herself with Lucas in order to save herself.This is why I like this series and Edie's character so much: she does what she has to do, even when the choices are terrible.Despite that Edie is in a pretty lousy situation, she's very aware of herself and the impact of her actions. Even when she makes bad choices (as in the first novel with her self-destructive behavior related to men), there's awareness about the potential for really bad things to happen. I\u2019d just pledged my help to a teenage-looking but hundred-year-old vampire whom I knew had a temper and a half. There was no way this could end badly, right?This is refreshing considering that in so much urban fantasy--and even more so in its cousin paranormal romance--the female leads don't have a tremendous amount of agency, nor do they suffer the consequences of their actions and decisions. For Edie Spence, consequences are a daily reality. \u201cCan your friend in the friend zone make a friendly suggestion?\u201d\u201cCertainly.\u201d\u201cThis time. For real. Get the fuck out of town.\u201dI bit my lip and looked at the hardwood floor. \u201cI still need my job to protect Jake, Asher.\u201d\u201cHe looked pretty clean to me.\u201d \u201cYeah, he\u2019s good at that.\u201d I put my hands up to my head and ran them through my hair. \u201cThere\u2019s just never any guarantee it will last.\u201d \u201cYou know, some people who knew you might say your life was worth a little more than his.\u201d I lifted my head up and glared at him. \u201cAsher\u2014\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re a nurse, you help people, you give back to the community\u2014you pay taxes. What does he do?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s my brother\u2014\u201d I protested. \u201cA lot of people start off life with siblings. But when you die, you die alone.\u201d I inhaled and exhaled a few times. \u201cI\u2019m not ready to give up on him yet.\u201d \u201cI bet. It\u2019s fun feeling needed, until it gets you killed.\u201dBut that's not to say Moonshifted is all serious and angsty. Because Edie's finally making connections with other people (besides her ne'er-do-well brother), the humor that was present in the first book is even more pronounced in the sequel.I thought about asking him for inappropriate things\u2014 then briefly remembered the naked men I\u2019d just seen and Gideon\u2019s parts at home. I really didn\u2019t need any more random genitalia in my life, and Gina and I needed to go.Particularly fun is Edie's growing closeness with Gina, a coworker from Y4, who has paranormal problems of her own.\u201cLet me get this straight. You were dating a were . . . bear?\u201d She nodded sorrowfully, her face cradled against the side of the porcelain bowl. \u201cI have to ask. Were there any brightly colored insignias on his chest? Like a rainbow, or an ice cream cone?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d she said, peering up. \u201cYou know. Like a Care Bear.\u201d \u201cFuck you, Edie.\u201d She closed her eyes, like that would make me disappear. \u201cI\u2019m just saying that if I were dating a were- bear, I would carefully check him over for any lame tattoos. Like of candy canes. Or sunshine.\u201d \u201cFuck you and fucking were-bears.\u201d She snorted.Moonshifted raises the stakes for Edie in the next book, Shapeshifted, and because of the events at the climax of Moonshifted, I can't even begin to guess where this series is headed. (Incidentally, I would not characterize the ending as a \"cliffhanger,\" because the story in Moonshifted is resolved, but Big Things happen at the end which left me internally screaming that I want Shapeshifted NOW!) I'm particularly curious how Edie's relationships (both with her friends from Y4 and her maybe-something with Lucas, the werewolf leader) will play out, given that her life is in such tumult.Alexander is ruthless with Edie, never really giving her a break and pushing her to the point that I wonder how she'll find a way to be happy and \"normal.\" Things look bleak for Edie, and I wonder what other obstacles will be thrown into her path--and if a certain zombie will return. Naturally, I cannot wait to follow her journey. Cassie Alexander's Edie Spence series, along with Jenn Bennett's  Jenn Bennett's Arcadia Bell books, stand out among a sea of new urban fantasy series as distictive, creative and as striking the right balance between action and character drama. If you're a fan of urban fantasy and your not reading both, you're missing out.

She doesn\u2019t have nearly enough time, especially with the holidays coming up, and even less money hence her taking overtime during the holidays in the hope of more money to pad her rapidly disappearing paycheck.That in itself would be exhausting, but that\u2019s before the king of the werewolves gets run over in a hit and run right in front of her. He\u2019s badly injured to the point of death and even the medical professionals on Y4 can\u2019t raise the dead \u2013 but the werewolf politics should he die (and the accusations that fly) are dangerous things to get in the middle of.And then there\u2019s Anna, the vampire she preciously helped and even considers a friend. She has a job for Edie as she prepares to found her own vampire house, a job that requires her to keep a ceremonial knife safe.Whichever is the cause \u2013 werewolf or knife \u2013people start trying to kill her, ransacking her home and even risking the wrath of the shadows, the hospital\u2019s mystical protectors, to get at her. And to make matters worse, her drug dealing brother is digging himself into trouble, her parents are coming for Christmas dinner and she has a German Ghostly Cyborg eating her electronics.That was immense fun. I liked the first book, Nightshifted, and found it interesting and pretty entertaining, but Moonshifted is head and shoulders above it. With the beginning of this world introduced, we\u2019re now running with this story in all directions and nearly everything is pretty much excellent.The world building is incredible \u2013 there has been such a lot of research that has gone into the various supernatural lores that are relevant in this book \u2013 including the 101 ways to make a werewolf which is drawing on some really obscure legends that I had to re-look up and I thought I was pretty overwhelmed with shapeshifter legends already. The way the vampires work, the way the werewolves work \u2013 they\u2019re all really really deep and with their own separate twists that add a lot of originality to the story; concepts like the werewolves\u2019 shorter life span (which makes so much sense when described) and the vampire shortage not of human blood, but of actual vampire blood since it takes so long for them to produce. All of these add wonderful new facets to old myths and legends and a completely new spin on everything.But along with the mystical world building which is wide open and growing, there\u2019s also the powerful realities of being a nurse. I love books when the protagonist has a profession and I\u2019m left thinking \u201cthis author has worked this job\u201d because it\u2019s so real, they\u2019ve either worked it or really put some sterling effort into making it real. John Hartness does it, Diana Rowland does it and Cassie Alexander certainly does it. It\u2019s not glamourised, it\u2019s not sugar coated and it\u2019s not clean \u2013 but the nitty gritty of nursing is there, the good and the icky, the sheer value and importance of it coupled with how undervalued and difficult it is. It\u2019s a really good depiction and makes the entire series so much stronger and more real because of it.What is best about both of these elements of world building is that they\u2019re used appropriately. There\u2019s no massive info dumps and no long monologues. It is shown rather than told, what we need to know is revealed in as much detail as we need to know it. It\u2019s completely restrained and leaves me hungry to know more \u2013 like what exactly the Consortium, and Meaty, actually are for one! everything feels natural because the knowledge is presented in a realistic fashion without every leaving us floundering.And the story is fun \u2013 it intertwines excellently with Edie\u2019s life but her life doesn\u2019t stop because of it. This is something else I love about this book, in a lot of Urban Fantasy it feels like the protagonist can just put their entire lives on pause while they deal with the plot of the book. Edie isn\u2019t like that \u2013 she has a job, she needs money, she even needs the desperate holiday overtime. She can\u2019t just not take those extra hours because the plot has been dropped on her, life goes on. And it\u2019s not just her job \u2013 she has family she can\u2019t just drop because dramas are happening, she had her brother and his issues, she has her parents coming round for Christmas Dinner. She can\u2019t cancel all this \u2013 and she has to clean up the flat ready for them \u2013 just because she has plot drama! Life goes on! Perhaps most impressive to me is Edie\u2019s friend\u2019s \u2013 they have their own lives, their own issues and that isn\u2019t subsumed because of Edie\u2019s plot issues. Charles has a thing with werewolves, he\u2019s not setting that aside because Edie is having problems. Gina has relationship drama, Edie can\u2019t just ignore it because of plot reasons \u2013 he\u2019s Gina\u2019s friend, she owes it to her to be supportive. Edie can\u2019t just refuse Anna\u2019s plea because it would be convenient to do otherwise. This is such a change from so many urban fantasies where friends just exist to support the protagonist.But aside from twining nicely with both the world building and Edie\u2019s life, the plot is fascinating. It\u2019s excellently paced and written, even with those elements blended into it, the book continues moving forward and never has slow periods. Even Edie having to go buy a couch cover just fits so neatly and adds to the book, these mundane tasks all add something, all develop something and help highlight the relationships without long monologues or info dumps. The mystery behind the injured werewolf king is a curious one. From the beginning I realised that the accused was clearly not the person behind it \u2013 it was too obviously a red herring \u2013 but I didn\u2019t even remotely predict who was actually behind the attack nor how it all came together with werewolf and vampire politics interlinking. It was really well done, all made sense, and all was a complete surprise. On top of the mystery, the actions scenes, when they arrive, were well written and had that perfect balance of pace versus description.Read More"}, {"userName": "Ashley ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5862536-ashley", "userReview": "I liked this one better than the last one.

However, I find myself growing weary of the way the supernaturals constantly coerce and con Edie into doing things for them without giving her any explanations or choices in the matter. Then, when the shit hits the fan, they never seem to have her back and she's left to pick up the pieces all on her own. Some of this is Edie's own fault. She has an abundance of do-gooder tendencies and she seems to be a bit of a doormat at times. She's also constantly being taken advantage of by her ex-junkie brother, he's the reason she had to take the crappy low paying job in the first place. In exchange, the powers that be, so to speak have promised to keep him clean. Their method, is to simply take away his ability to become high, no matter what he shoots or smokes. I can understand Edie's need to save her brother keeping her under their thumb. What I can't understand is her constant gullibility in helping the rest of the supernatural community, the ones that have nothing at all to do with her brother or the bargain she made for him. Her brother, although he can't physically obtain any type of high, still retains his shifty untrustworthy ways and tends to walk all over Edie, preying on her sympathy, stealing from her and pawning her things etc..I am so ready for Edie to have some type of screaming breakdown. Enough is enough for crying out loud.Then the ending. I didn't quite understand it, I mean I know what happened. Edie took drastic measures to prevent something happening which might have had devastating consequences. No one thanks her of course, not at all. She ends up being shunned, by the baby vampire queen she is constantly saving. This might have been a blessing in disguise because the vampires are total shits for the most part, but it applied to the entire supernatural community. This I didn't understand. I never read any explanations or had any indication that the vampires were in any position of authority over the weres, shapeshifters, zombies and all the rest, much less the shadows, those controlling the hospital who are keeping at bay the addictions of Edie's brother Jake.This was a huge disappointment to me. I am quite tired of vampires consistently being at the top of the food chain.

If, by chance, you're interested in sub-par porn with an needlessly and poorly executed elaborate plot, then this is the book for you! Seriously, I'm disappointed. The first book wasn't exactly a mind-blowing pieces of literature either, Alexander is certainly not a Dickens, but it was fun and entertaining. The main character was a strong woman, mildly promiscuous, but not slutty, and then Moonshifted happened.The interesting werewolf/vampire dynamic, though elaborated upon in the next book, did not draw me further into the book's universe. I had wrongfully predicted after reading the first book, that I would be interested in the following two, but as it turns out, I no longer have plans to read the third installment. The main character was a total slut in this story, and practically owned up to it. I can assure you, I am no prude, but books like this, where the protagonist seems to have an implicit goal to have kinky sex with a member of every present species in the series before it ends, is part of the reason that the Urban Fantasy genre gets a bad rap. It is becoming a stereotype that I abhor.Also, if an author is going to obviously add a character into the story in order for them to conveniently save the main character, it needs to be done tactfully. It must also not be overused. This is the second time that Alexander has done this. The first instance was Asher, who then played a similar role in the second book as the first, and then the second example was the bear-shapeshifting boyfriend, who had only a tentative attachment to the main character. No doubt Alexander employed this method so that the reader \"wouldn't see it coming\".My intelligence has been insulted. This kind of writing is painfully formulaic and reminiscent of -shudder- Stephanie Meyer. And yet even Meyer employed strategic symbolism. Moonshifted reeks of amateur mimicry, to the point that I've read fanfiction more original than this. My advice, don't read this book, and if you don't believe me, that's fine, go rad it and then afterwards regret having wasted precious moments of your life."}, {"userName": "All Things Urban Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732683-all-things-urban-fantasy", "userReview": "Review Courtesy of All Things Urban FantasyWhere NIGHTSHIFTED, the first book in the Edie Spence series setup Edie\u2019s crazy life and hospital job, MOONSHIFTED expanded on the danger and supernatural consequences of Edie\u2019s actions as a nurse in the Y4 wing of her hospital. The first book focused heavily on vampires and, while they are featured in MOONSHIFTED I was excited to see my favorite supernatural creatures, werewolves, be the focus of this book. Their introduction and the plot surrounding the issues of werewolf pack leadership really helped increase the scope and detail of the world Edie exists in.The pacing in MOONSHIFTED is quick and the writing is sharp. I especially appreciated the balance maintained between humor and horror as too much of one could have soured the book. There were instances where the gory descriptions of characters needed some levity to maintain the lighter tone of this series.Edie really feels relatable as she consistently makes mistakes and errors in judgement and has to face the consequences of her decisions with intelligence, wit, and some help from her friends.

When Edie and her coworker witness a hit and run outside of the hospital while on lunch break they jump in to help. Not only does the patient end up being someone that belongs on Y4 but his presence is the cause of most of the problems in MOONSHIFTED. This series has been really easy to fall into.

She has a few different romantic interests in book 2 and I honestly liked both but I don't see anything major happening between any of them anytime soon. I really hope zombie man doesn't return though. I would have to rip off one of his arms and beat him over the head with it or something. I was truly shocked with some of the situations that were thrown at Edie in MOONSHIFTED. She tends to handle things with her head held high with her allies by her side.What is up with the ending?

Alexander is a real-life nurse, and brings that realism to her urban fantasy featuring a nurse working on Y4, the top-secret paranormal creature wing of the hospital. There are a gazillion urban fantasies out there right now, and for me that touch of medical realism is what sets this series apart and makes it an engrossing (and sometimes gross!) read.The plot and pace are well-woven here. Edie must balance paranormal shenanigans at work, paranormal shenanigans outside of work, and the urge to save the junkie brother. The only thing I find irksome is Edie's habit of one-night stands.

The plot of the first book was tight and suspenseful, whereas the storyline in Moonshifted is rather confusing and disjointed. The first installment also had a surprisingly sweet romance that provided some relief from the grimness of the rest of the book. Now that's gone, replaced by a mess of romantic entanglements that don't really do anything for the story. The writing is not as polished, and the whole final quarter of the book felt slapped together, complete with overly dramatic dialogue, moments that were supposed to be emotional but weren't, and rushed explanations that didn't completely make sense.

A few months have passed since the events of Nightshifted, Edie has since healed up and returned back to work as a nurse on the Y4 floor of her hospital. Y4 is the secret wing that treats supernaturals and those close to them. Thankfully, Edie and her colleague Charles were the first on the scene of the man hit and run so when they realized he was a werewolf they quickly worked to get him under control and to the Y4 wing.Edie Spence is probably the most unremarkable woman in an urban fantasy series. She doesn\u2019t have anything special that she brings to the plate except for the fact that she is a human that knows about the supernatural. She doesn\u2019t come off as overly pretty, she\u2019s a few pounds overweight but not obese by any means, she doesn\u2019t have a \u201cwow\u201d factor but for some reason, the supernatural is drawn to her. This may come off as harsh but I\u2019m just trying to explain how she is the plainest Jane but down to earth girl in this supernatural world, although she has no problem with cussing and the occasional one night stand. As a third shift nurse she is pretty much a loner, she really only hangs out with her co-workers at work and making friends with the occasional supernatural who gets thrown into her life. In a way I really enjoy the normalcy of Edie because when her life gets turned upside down, it really goes haywire in a way that is often so terrible it is funny. Edie is also a really nice person at heart; whenever someone is in pain or just needs someone to listen to them she is always there, often neglecting something that could be good because she can\u2019t leave someone behind.Moonshifted was a crazy book in that there were several storylines going on at once. The plot was pretty much shrouded in secrecy and didn\u2019t make much sense until the end and even then I still have some questions. The werewolves are undergoing a shift in power while the vampire Anna is making a bid at becoming leader of her own house. There almost seems to be a civil war amongst the two groups while Edie is getting attacked by those on both sides. This novel really does find Edie being rescued a lot by her supernatural \u201cfriends\u201d or her calling for their help. She doesn\u2019t really get herself out of any scraps except for one that I can really think of.So far I have really enjoyed how this series is really different from other urban fantasy novels. Anna is a different type of vampire; the wolves have terrible life spans; Shadows control and hide the existence of the supernatural from humans; and the shapeshifter changes into humans not animals, although there were no zombies in this novel as opposed to Nightshifted.I don\u2019t think it is necessary to have read Nightshifted before reading Moonshifted. It could be read as a standalone but I don\u2019t really recommend it. It is easier to understand some of the characters and the Shadows with some more background. And you\u2019ll definitely want to read the next novel with the way this one ended. No cliffhanger here but I don\u2019t know how Edie will survive without help.Overall, not an entirely perfect novel but I enjoyed the flawed Edie and the world that she lives in. I can\u2019t wait to see what is next for her in Shapeshifted.Notable Scene:He looked over to me, and the shadows in the room made his eyes glow copper, like an animal\u2019s in the night. \u201cDon\u2019t worry. I won\u2019t hurt him. He\u2019s already as good as dead.\u201dHe patted Winter\u2019s chest again and came back toward the door. Instead of passing me, he grabbed my shoulders and spun me sideways to press me against the room\u2019s wall, pinning me there. To call for help would be humiliating at best, injurious at worst. I remembered Charles\u2019s story about weres saying they didn\u2019t know their own strength afterward, and completely believed him.I squeaked out, \u201cHow were the fights?\u201d like a normal conversation with him would be possible now.His face an inch away from mine, he said, \u201cEasy.\u201dHe kissed me like he owned me. My head was pressed against the wall behind me, and his tongue ran deep inside my mouth. He only pulled back to tease, his hot breath gentle on my lips, before kissing me again.Half of me wanted to leap outside my skin and run away, or scream. The other half wanted everything else from him, here, now, forget propriety, forget the disgusting hospital floor.He planted his hand against my mouth so I couldn\u2019t scream, and licked up the side of my face. His other hand trailed down my body outside my thin cotton scrubs, stroking my breast, diving between my legs.\u201cYou still want me,\u201d he said, finally letting me go.I wiped his spit off my cheek. \u201cPeople often want what they can\u2019t have.\u201dFTC Advisory: St. Martin\u2019s Press/Macmillan provided me with a copy of Moonshifted.

I stumbled upon her debut novel , Nightshifted,late last spring and I devoured it in one gulp.  I've been counting down the months and then the days for the sequel to be released. *Kermit flail* It's here! It's here!OK, do you read urban fantasy? Do you like stories with paranormal elements? What if the paranormal creatures aren't all sparkely or even very nice for that matter? Still game? Then come meet Edie and fall in love.The heroine of these stories is Edie Spence and she's a nurse. She's funny and snarky and brave and stupid and smart and courageous. She just feels real. She makes some decisions without thinking everything through... just like I would. She works hard and tries to do the right thing even when the situation is extremely murky. I connected with her and have been on her side since the beginning.I was immediately drawn into Edie's world. It's very familiar, in fact Edie had no clue of the supernatural until it was brought to her attention in the first novel. We are taken on a journey with her as she gets sucked deeper and deeper into the underworld... And it is UNDER. She took a job working in the sub-basement of her hospital to provide nursing for supernaturals who need medical attention. She works on Y4 because she made a bargain with The Shadows. They saved her brothers life and now she works with the paranormals in the basement. The Shadows protect the hospital because they feed on the fear and suffering and it's a good feeding ground. Edie got a crash course in this new world in Nightshifted and is still trying to come to grips with her discoveries from that adventure.In Moonshifted, Anna, the vampire Edie befriended in the first story, needs Edie to stand with her in an important ceremony. Anna entrusts Edie with a special knife that she needs her to bring to the initiation ceremony on New Year's Eve. Edie recognizes how serious this is to Anna and says she'll do it, even though she's giving up the opportunity to make holiday pay working that night. ;) I adore Edie's way of looking at the world, she's very pragmatic and snarktastic and she acknowledges that this might not be the best idea.\"I'd just pledged my help to a teenage-looking but hundred-year-old vampire whom I knew had a temper and a half. There was no way this could end badly, right?\"Edie was right to be concerned. She really just wants to go to work and go home to get some sleep! But events keep conspiring against that dream. There's vampires and werewolves who are trying to interfere with the ceremony. Therepack leaderred packleader among her patients to care for. There is an extra shift on the above ground floor to handle. And there's her family and Christmas to deal with and the fact that they are spending Christmas dinner at her house and she needs to cover the blood stains on her couch and she doesn't have a dining table! She has a lot on her plate. On top of all that she's mourning the loss of her boyfriend and going from the hope of being an \"us\" back to just a \"me\". Plus she's majorly sleep deprived. I love her spirit and her persistence and determination in the face of all these challenges.I really enjoy the author's writing style. Some of the descriptive passages made me stop and re-read them again so I could capture the visual. Like this one \"The sun was almost gone, just a dull pressing lightness, like the beginning of a migraine, hiding behind thick clouds.\" And the medical scenes? Yep, you can see the blood and almost smell the gore. You can feel the life pulse through this novel.Here are a few more of my favorite lines...\u2666 \u201cLet me get this straight. You were dating a were . . . bear?\u201d She nodded sorrowfully, her face cradled against the side of the porcelain bowl. \u201cI have to ask. Were there any brightly colored insignias on his chest?

More jeans, and a bulky sweater. I put my silver bracelet on,\"\u2666 \"If in the future you have a choice between blatantly warning me about possible death, versus vaguely warning me in a smug fashion, please go with the former.\"I highly recommend Moonshifted if you are interested in a fast paced urban fantasy with mystery, mayhem, family drama, secrets, sex, lies, politics and a very human, very relatable, protagonist who faces the supernatural and doesn't back down or give up!I am eagerly waiting for the 3rd book, Shapeshifted in June of 2013.

Edie vermutet einen Mordanschlag und erneut ermittelt die mutige Krankenschwester auf eigene Faust!Fazit\"Night Shifted\" Visite bei Vollmond ist der zweite Band der Night Shifted Reihe von Cassie Alexander. Wie schon Band 1 ist dieser Roman sehr au\u00dfergew\u00f6hnlich geschrieben und bringt endlich mal frischen Wind in die Fantasy-Szene. Anders als andere Romane beschr\u00e4nkt sich dieser nicht auf eine Spezies sondern das ganze Buch hindurch werden alle m\u00f6glichen Formen von fantastischen Wesen angesprochen, zu Hauptfiguren gemacht, in die Geschichte mit einbezogen und vorgestellt. Das ganze wirkt sehr erfrischend, spritzig, spannend und interessant, die Charaktere sind durch die Bank weg sehr tiefgreifend und hintergr\u00fcndig und die Geschichte nimmt so manch spannende Wendung. Band 2 konnte mich noch ein St\u00fcck weit mehr faszinieren als Band 1, \u00fcberzeugt er doch mit seiner spannenderen Geschichte und neuen Charakteren, die die alten jedoch nicht ersetzen sondern wunderbar in das Geflecht der bestehenden Figuren mit eingesponnen werden.Man erf\u00e4hrt noch mehr \u00fcber die Krankenschwester Edie, kann tiefer in ihre Gedanken- und Gef\u00fchlswelt eintauchen und lernt sie im Gesamtbild viel besser kennen. Der Charakter des Gestaltwandler Asher taucht vermehrt auf, bildet sich mehr zu einem der Hauptcharaktere und wird ein ganzes St\u00fcck sympathischer, der Leser wird dazu gebracht ihm Vertrauen entgegenzubringen - man muss ihn einfach m\u00f6gen. Edies Bruder Jake taucht ebenfalls des \u00f6fteren auf, seine Drogensucht scheint zwar besiegt doch dieses Mal handelt er mit einer geheimnisvollen Substanz die sich Luna Lobus nennt und noch einige Geheimnisse birgt...Jake macht im Gegensatz zu den anderen Figuren kaum eine Entwicklung durch, er bleibt immer wieder derselbe - was ihn zu einem best\u00e4ndigen Charakter macht, der auch in jedem Roman vorhanden sein sollte. Mir pers\u00f6nlich ist der gute Mann dann aber doch etwas suspekt, ich bin mir nie sicher in welche Schublade ich ihn stecken soll und diese Einstellung \u00e4nderte sich den ganzen Roman \u00fcber nicht mehr. Die Figuren von Anna und Sike lernt man ebenfalls besser kennen und trotz ihrer gef\u00e4hrlichen, etwas seltsamen Art versp\u00fcrt man doch eine gewisse Sympathie, besonders da sie sich trotzallem als loyale Partner erweisen - die Geschichte um die beiden, die mitunter zur Hauptgeschichte geh\u00f6ren begann schon in Band 1 und wird hier weiter ausgef\u00fchrt. Sehr suspekt war mir dann aber doch die Gestalt des Gro\u00dfvaters, bzw. die des Guideon - irgendwie waren mir die \"Vorg\u00e4nge\" dieser \"Personen\" dann doch etwas zu weit hergeholt und \u00fcberstiegen stellenweise einfach meine Vorstellungskraft. Mir pers\u00f6nlich blieben um diese/n Charakter(e) zuviele Fragen offen und ich hoffe fast ein bisschen, dass sich das im dritten und abschlie\u00dfenden Band der Reihe dann doch noch etwas kl\u00e4rt.Die Werw\u00f6lfe r\u00fcckten in diesem Band besonders in den Vordergrund, meiner Ansicht nach eine sehr gute Idee, vorallem da in Band 1 die Vampire dominierten. Die Werw\u00f6lfe wurden sehr gut und glaubw\u00fcrdig beschrieben, man konnte sie schon fast vor sich sehen, sie riechen und sp\u00fcren. So manches Mal entgleiste meine Fantasie tats\u00e4chlich soweit, dass ich mich in dieser Welt wiederfand und sie einfach sp\u00fcren wollte - fast als m\u00fcsste ich nur die Hand ausstrecken und nach ihnen greifen.Eine Liebesgeschichte tritt dieses Mal nicht auf, lediglich das ein oder andere Beziehungs-Drama von anderen Protagonisten bzw. Techtelmechtel von Edie. Dies st\u00f6rt jedoch nicht den Fluss der Geschichte, man muss ja schlie\u00dflich nicht immer eine Liebesstory dabei haben, sofern die erotischen Szenen trotzdem passend eingebaut sind - was in diesem Roman durchaus der Fall ist. Blutig ist es aber nach wie vor - alles andere w\u00e4re schlie\u00dflich auch langweilig. ;-)Band 1 \"Medizin um Mitternacht\" sollte man unbedingt gelesen haben, ansonsten werden viele Beziehungen und Verbindungen nicht klar und die Geschichte erscheint unvollst\u00e4ndig da zuviele Hintergrundinformationen fehlen. Der Roman \"Visite bei Vollmond\" wurde fl\u00fcssig und in gut verst\u00e4ndlicher Sprache verfasst, die Kapitel sind ausreichend lang und die Schrift ist gro\u00df genug gew\u00e4hlt. Die Wortwahl finde ich sehr gelungen, die Autorin schreibt mit Witz und schafft es auch in spannenden Situationen immer die Spannung aufrecht zu erhalten."}, {"userName": "LilyElement", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5639357-lilyelement", "userReview": "Moonshifted is book 2 in the Edie Spence series. I read book one awhile back and enjoyed that the leading lady is a human nurse dealing with a bunch of paranormal beings. I wound up grabbing the audiobook of this installment from the library and I'm so glad I did. This time around we're dealing heavily with the werewolves and a bit about vampires. And man Edie Spence manages to always get in trouble.Edie Spence is a nurse in the Y4 wing of the hospital, her floor handles all the paranormal beings that humans know nothing about. While out with a coworker they see a man get hit by a car and find out he's a werewolf. After rushing him back to their floor of the hospital and stabilizing him they find out he's not just any werewolf, he's the alpha of the local pack. There is a power struggle going on amongst the werewolves and Edie is smack dab in the middle of it all. She's having to pick which side to trust but has no proof that it's the right choice until possibly too late. If that's not enough, she's also dealing with the vampire she helped save in book one as well as issues with her brother.Moonshifted was a delight to read and I cannot wait to get my hands on the next book. It does leave off where the series could have ended so I had to look up immediately to see if there was another book. I'm glad there is since I can't seem to get enough. It's really refreshing to read an Urban Fantasy book with a human character dealing with paranormal beings. I feel like most of the books in this genre have a paranormal being as the leading character and they wind up being super powerful by the end of the series. I do like how this installment revolves around the werewolves, with some vampire action on the side. It helped get a firmer grip on the paranormal aspects of the series since book one was about the vampires. All in all, this was a solid addition to the series and I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good Urban Fantasy read."}, {"userName": "Blood Rose Books", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6216782-blood-rose-books", "userReview": "This is the second novel of Cassie Alexander's Edie Spence series. You will need to read the first book, Nightshifted, before this one as the first book sets up where Edie's life is, with her world, work and relationships.In the second book Edie not only has to worry about the Vampires but the Were have also come to call:Y4 nurse Edie Spence is just looking forward to getting back to work after surviving a vampire attack, she expects things to just get back to normal; Well as normal as working with paranormal creatures can be. When Edie witnesses a hit in run that just happens to involve the leader of the wolf pack, Edie does everything to help him survive but things are looking very grim. This starts a battle for not only the power within the pack but also with the paranormal within the city and all the targets seem to be posted on Edie's back as she now has connection to both. Edie doesn't know how she is going to survive attacks on all fronts especially to top it all off Dren is back and he is looking to settle a debt with Edie as she cost him his hand and his hound. With no one to trust or rely on, Edie better watch out everything in her life is about to be tested to the extreme and only time will tell if she can survive it all.This book is another easy read like the first, which is sure to entertain but I feel like this series is going to be more for those who like paranormal romance than those who just want the paranormal genre. I do not think that this book is as good as the first. I found that this book was not as funny as the first book and lacked the action that occurred within the first book. I think it took about half of the book before there is really any sort of action and for the mystery aspect within the plot to actually start, so I was often left wonder okay when is it going to get good, when is everything going to start. However, I will say the mystery and action within the second half of the book was really good and interesting, I just would have liked it to be more constant throughoutI still really like Edie as a character. She has complex relationship with everyone around her in both the normal and paranormal world. I question whether she is actually able to have a normal relationship, possible the closest one is with some of the people at work that seem to be developing but when you work on Y4 how normal can those relationships be. I love that Alexander keeps Edie as human as possible, and it does not seem to be anything that is going to change. Having Edie be human and it appears with no plans to change that, is what sets this series apart from other books in the paranormal genre where the human either end up as food, or have some form of power(s). It's nice to have the human aspect stay constant and it is funny how that it the unique characteristic within this series.I'm not sure what changed in Alexander's writing style but I found that there was a lot more sex in this book than the first one and all of a sudden Edie is very sexually charged/promiscuous. I know in the first book there was talk and one sex scene, I just found that in this book every paranormal male that Edie ran into she all of sudden wanted to sleep with them. I just found this counter to what Edie was like in the first book or at least Alexander began to expand on the scenes sex now. I do not think that this book was as good as a first and that there was just something missing overall in the book, I think that those who liked the first will also enjoy this book if they like more of the paranormal romance genre. I will continue to reading this series as I personally like Edie and her attempt to stay human at all costs, which is very refreshing, but I do not think that I will continue reading if the sex turns into something like the Laurell K. Hamilton Anita Blake series did.Enjoy!!!"}, {"userName": "Kristie Elston", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4414132-kristie-elston", "userReview": "Originally reviewed at Dark Faerie Tales: http://darkfaerietales.com/review-moo...Quick & Dirty: Enjoyable main character and world but the plot left me a little confused.The Review:The second novel in Cassie Alexander\u2019s Edie Spence series, Moonshifted, begins with Edie witnessing a hit and run accident. A few months have passed since the events of Nightshifted, Edie has since healed up and returned back to work as a nurse on the Y4 floor of her hospital. Y4 is the secret wing that treats supernaturals and those close to them. Thankfully, Edie and her colleague Charles were the first on the scene of the man hit and run so when they realized he was a werewolf they quickly worked to get him under control and to the Y4 wing.Edie Spence is probably the most unremarkable woman in an urban fantasy series. She doesn\u2019t have anything special that she brings to the plate except for the fact that she is a human that knows about the supernatural. She doesn\u2019t come off as overly pretty, she\u2019s a few pounds overweight but not obese by any means, she doesn\u2019t have a \u201cwow\u201d factor but for some reason, the supernatural is drawn to her. This may come off as harsh but I\u2019m just trying to explain how she is the plainest Jane but down to earth girl in this supernatural world, although she has no problem with cussing and the occasional one night stand. As a third shift nurse she is pretty much a loner, she really only hangs out with her co-workers at work and making friends with the occasional supernatural who gets thrown into her life. In a way I really enjoy the normalcy of Edie because when her life gets turned upside down, it really goes haywire in a way that is often so terrible it is funny. Edie is also a really nice person at heart; whenever someone is in pain or just needs someone to listen to them she is always there, often neglecting something that could be good because she can\u2019t leave someone behind.Moonshifted was a crazy book in that there were several storylines going on at once. The plot was pretty much shrouded in secrecy and didn\u2019t make much sense until the end and even then I still have some questions. The werewolves are undergoing a shift in power while the vampire Anna is making a bid at becoming leader of her own house. There almost seems to be a civil war amongst the two groups while Edie is getting attacked by those on both sides. This novel really does find Edie being rescued a lot by her supernatural \u201cfriends\u201d or her calling for their help. She doesn\u2019t really get herself out of any scraps except for one that I can really think of.So far I have really enjoyed how this series is really different from other urban fantasy novels. Anna is a different type of vampire; the wolves have terrible life spans; Shadows control and hide the existence of the supernatural from humans; and the shapeshifter changes into humans not animals, although there were no zombies in this novel as opposed to Nightshifted.I don\u2019t think it is necessary to have read Nightshifted before reading Moonshifted. It could be read as a standalone but I don\u2019t really recommend it. It is easier to understand some of the characters and the Shadows with some more background. And you\u2019ll definitely want to read the next novel with the way this one ended. No cliffhanger here but I don\u2019t know how Edie will survive without help.Overall, not an entirely perfect novel but I enjoyed the flawed Edie and the world that she lives in. I can\u2019t wait to see what is next for her in Shapeshifted."}, {"userName": "Angela Carr (Under the Covers Book Blog)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119085-angela-carr-under-the-covers-book-blog", "userReview": "Review also posted at Under The Covers Book Blog \u201cEdie Spence series is for sure one of the best UF books around.\u201d ~Under the CoversMoonshifted is the second installment of Edie Spence series. Ms. Alexander delivered another well written and engaging story. She managed to make this book even better with a more detailed but complex plot. I devoured it in about two and half days which is big for me considering I\u2019m a slow reader.Edie continues to get her nursing experience working at a secret unit called Y4 where her patients are of the supernatural kind. If you read Nightshifted (book1), you know that Edie is a special nurse. She is a patient advocate and she goes above and beyond her duties. She is good at what she does and can handle high stress level situations. Well, she definitely proved that here when chaos occurs at her work as well as her personal life.The world building is more in-depth in this installment. Ms. Alexander definitely widened the world, it\u2019s not just limited to the patients in Y4 but even beyond the hospital walls. Edie is more involved with the faction of vampires\u2019 and the wolves\u2019 hierarchies during the overturn of leaders. Along with the caring for a patient who happens to be the Alpha of his pack; she also promised to be responsible and be a part of a vampire coronation ceremony. Both factions are involved in a power struggle that is of course brewing into war. Edie just finds herself in the midst of all the chaos. I\u2019m telling you, they all seem to flock to her for help. While she does well with this type of chaos, I can\u2019t say the same for her love life.She still doesn\u2019t have one. After her zombie boyfriend left her she just can\u2019t seem to shake him off. Not that she doesn\u2019t have any choices, in fact, she has two good candidates. Asher, a sexy shifter is at her beck and call. And Lucas, a wolf up for the Alpha leadership position is also very interested. It\u2019s frustrating to see her attraction for them but not able to give a relationship a chance. I mean, both men are super sexy, very powerful and did I mention sexy? I just totally disagree with her sleeping around and I can\u2019t wait for her to give love a chance. *Preferably with Asher*Edie\u2019s co-workers, her brother and even her mom were fun to read about. They are so easy to love or hate (as far as her brother goes). Ms. Alexander is obviously knowledgeable about nursing care but what awes me is her incorporation of it into a paranormal world. It was really cool to see how protocols are handled when your patients are supernaturals. Ms. Alexander ended this book with a bit of a cliffhanger. There were some decisions that seemed final and I\u2019m curious to see how she will pull Edie out of that situation.I enjoyed every bit of this book. The plot is very intriguing, full of action and a good amount of smexy. Edie Spence series is for sure one of the best UF books around.*ARC provided by publisher"}, {"userName": "Miki", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6101808-miki", "userReview": "This Review was first published on my blog Lecture toute une AventureMy opinion:  To start with the positive, i greatly enjoyed the plot in this book, the fact the werewolves were predominant could help ^^ but i enjoyed it and getting Bear-weres was more than interesting. Thanks to Gina and Lucas we learn more about how weres are mad, how it can be transmitted in this universe. So after focusing on vampires in book1 now it\u2019s on were, going progressively is a good idea in my opinion since there is a lot to learn and like Edie we get it slowly. I also really enjoyed finding Asher back, still the same. He is really a good back up for Edie and I would love if she was more grateful to him. She is interested partly but she fears him and not being sure which appearance is real is disturbing for her\u2026 I can get that but only to a point. I mean he is oki when she needs help but she has difficulties to consider him as a friend\u2026and when she does she still has reservations, not fair.Anna was also a character I was pleased to see even more that she is perfectly coherent with how she was described in Nightshifted. In book 1 I has a small preference for grand father , and he didn\u2019t disappoint me in this one except for a detail\u2026 i admit the mixing with Gideon was surprising and it\u2019s still surprising but i thought he was there for Edie, now he is with Anna since Gideon is part of her house\u2026. Edie get left behind so i wonder where his loyalty lies and I\u2019m a little afraid.The rhythm is not too fast even if we do get lot information at the same time, the action is fast paced and Edie takes time to start thinking about consequences and everything that\u2019s happening around her\u2026 but she is still strong willed and quite selfless, trying to help everyone. Oh and we get to see the superior of the shadows and i loved that part\u2026So after so many positive elements why not an higher score? I\u2019m fed up with Edie\u2019s love life if we can call it that. I mean in book one she has a one night stand with a shapeshifter the she is in a relationship with a zombie\u2026 so far i can accept but then because the said zombie left she jump on a were and nearly try to start again with Asher\u2026.and when she does she is crying after. Oki she is a grown adult woman, yes she can have needs but a new supernatural creature each time? Worse: one that could start a change and she won\u2019t be human\u2026 yes she doesn\u2019t know all the specifics since she was interrupted in her chat with Gina but still she is a nurse so she should know better and sleeping around isn\u2019t something i agree with so her behaviour on that part didn\u2019t sit well with me at all. So if you want a good urban fantasy, different creatures, some steamy scenes a great plot and don\u2019t mind an heroine like Edie, this book is a more than enjoyable reads.Score: 3,5/5Disclaimer: All opinions are my own and no compensation was received in exchange for this review"}], "description": "Check in to County Hospital\u2019s secret ward\u2014where paranormal activities lead to medical emergencies for one tireless nurse\u2026After surviving a brutal vampire attack, Nurse Edie Spence is ready to get back to work\u2014attending to supernatural creatures in need of medical help.
