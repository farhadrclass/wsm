Repression is liberation. A police state is a democratic republic. And we were \u201cthe masters of our own destiny.\u201d And if we begged to differ, we were dead.\nThis is one powerful little memoir. It's a true story that sounds like dystopian fiction - for most of us, it is difficult to imagine families being lured to a new \"paradise\", only to be met with famine, concentration camps and violence. It's hard to accept that this is still part of our world.I, like many, am fascinated and horrified by North Korea. Recent news stories have only fuelled that particular fire of fascination. I've read fiction about the history of Korea in books such as Pachinko, which showed many Koreans migrating to Japan during colonization and being seen as second class citizens. Then, later, when their home country was split in two, many were unable to return. I have also read Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea, which documents a variety of different experiences from defectors.A River in Darkness complements both those books and adds something very unique - a detailed first person account of what it was and is really like to live in this secretive nation.Ishikawa was born in Japan but his Korean father was seduced by promises of \"paradise\" and having \"everything you need\" in North Korea. The Red Cross shipped Japanese families to North Korea; something which the Japanese government and the UN were all too aware of and made no effort to prevent. So Ishikawa's family packed up and got on the boat. They arrived in a wasteland of horrors and were given a shack to live in with no electricity or running water.For over thirty years, Ishikawa and his family suffered and starved. No one dared to speak out against the system, and it would have done no good if they did. As Japanese nationals, they were labelled as \"hostiles\", which meant they were given the worst jobs and worst homes. Ishikawa lost loved ones, his freedom, and most of his life to North Korea.It is a deeply sad memoir and even the ending brings little relief. Ishikawa admits that he can feel nothing but bitterness. It's a dark, haunting, and eye-opening look into one of the greatest atrocities of our time.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Lo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7013687-lo", "userReview": "The short version: This is easily the best firsthand narrative about life in North Korea that I've found, and it's a gripping, well-written story in its own right. If you haven't read anything like this, it will be VERY educational. But be aware that it doesn't have the happy ending the title implies, and prepare yourself accordingly. The long version: Some years ago, I realized that my view of North Korea was overly cartoonish. I didn't want to think of it as \"the most hilarious awful dictatorship\" anymore, so I started reading about it. There's an awful lot of political and economic posturing and maneuvering to read about, and tons of analysis about the leaders and the military, but what about the actual people who live there? What are their lives like? Turns out that it's pretty hard to find out. The fact that regular citizens, especially the non-elite, are essentially hostages makes it hard to get information. I found and really enjoyed Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea, a collection of stories from former North Koreans living in exile. That's interesting in that the stories come from a variety of people who came from different backgrounds in North Korea, but this book is a much more in-depth picture of a single life, and has better narrative flow. The prose is spare and impressively clear, and the book is quite short. Ishikawa was born in Japan and moved as part of a mass migration program that essentially tricked huge numbers of Koreans to \"return\" from Japan to North Korea, facilitated by the Red Cross. Many had never even been to North Korea, and empty promises of opportunity were repeated for years. This program, and the subsequent ill treatment of the Japanese \"returnees\" by the \"native\" Koreans was eye-opening to discover. Because of this aspect, the story manages to be even more grim than other stories I've read, which is really saying something. Just the first few pages, while he's still a child in Japan, were enough to fill an entire teary daytime talk show. And while life after escaping is never easy for the fortunate Koreans who make it out alive, the poor guy has a worse outcome than any I've heard before. The horrors in the lives depicted are many, from the extreme to the mundane - starvation, long propaganda meetings, being denied opportunity due to circumstances of your birth, facing inadequate shelter, and that's all before the 90s famine. But the greatest horror is revealed gradually across many small moments: to survive people must lose their humanity, stop seeing each other as people, no longer caring if their neighbors live or die. Then the government uses the citizens as the most effective tool to oppress themselves by turning them against each other, encouraging and rewarding reporting your own family for defying the regime. The most common lament I've read (across all accounts) about the famine was, \"the kind people were the first to die.\" As much as I found myself deeply appreciating eating dinner after reading this, I was even more moved by the love and support of my friends and family, savoring the marvelous experience of not having to fear for their lives every day. I would recommend that everyone read this, and probably try to convince them given the opportunity, because there's a lot more to North Korea than nuclear weapons. If more people knew what life there is like, it would undoubtedly help -- it's pretty hard not to care in the face of this insanity. But I wouldn't force this on anyone, because it really is a difficult read twice over. First, while you're reading, the events in the story are brutal. It's hard to watch an incredibly resilient protagonist be defeated again and again. Then after you're done with the book, it's depressing to watch the world let this situation continue because it's too much trouble to address. The political and economic arguments seem even more unsatisfactory. On the other hand, it's not all bad. Nothing has ever made me appreciate my life like reading this. Every time Ishikawa's story pops into my mind, and it's hard to forget, I feel a huge wave of gratitude in addition to the sadness and compassion.So read it, but please be ready."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "I liked A River in Darkness: One Man's Escape from North Korea a lot. It is a personally told story. The author is speaking from his heart of what he has experienced\u2014first ostracism in Japan due to his dual Japanese and Korean background, then the horror of the thirty-six years of his life spent in North Korea from 1960-1996 under the rule of Kim Il Sung and then Kim Jong Il, why he had to flee, how he did it and finally what happened when he returned to Japan. During his youth in Japan, where he was born in1947, he was discriminated against because of his Korean background. Emigrating to North Korea at the age of thirteen, he was again discriminated against, now because of his Japanese background. His mother was Japanese, his father South Korean. He has lived a very difficult life as a second-class citizen without a country to call home. Successfully escaping from North Korea in 1996, perhaps this looks like a story with a happy ending. It isn\u2019t. This man\u2019s life is noteworthy. His life story needed to be published. It is a memoir written not for him but for us. The book was first published in 2000, but only now has it drawn attention, twenty-two years after fleeing North Korea. The Japanese government helped Ishikawa escape, but his escape was hushed up and he was not to tell anyone. Relations between Japan and China would otherwise have been strained. Back in Japan, he was no longer on the verge of death from starvation, but he was a-g-a-i-n without job, family or friends. He escaped for the sole purpose of rescuing his family, and this he has not been able to do. The dire situation existing in North Korea is today common knowledge. The Korean leaders are faulted, as they should be, but the complicity of Japan, China, the UN, the Red Cross and other world authorities should be acknowledged too. The events in Ishikawa\u2019s life show this. It took me awhile to get caught up in the story. I approached the book from the wrong direction. I was looking for an impersonal presentation of clear facts, and it took me a while to understand what this book offers instead. I questioned some of the information laid at my feet. I found holes in what I was given. I would ask myself why did that happen and why did that person do that?! For example, it is hard to understand why Ishikawa\u2019s mother married his father. Neither are we given a full explanation of how and why his father ended up in Japan. This is not a book written by an impartial third party, nor a book offering a thorough presentation of documented facts and research. The author does not have full information; he is telling us what he does know, and he is telling it as if you were sitting across the table from him. He is just talking, not in fancy words, not peppered with proof or statistics. He speaks in simple words, telling how, step by step, his life unfolded, how one event lead to another and another and how it has felt to live through these events! He swears. Yes, he complains. He isn\u2019t stoical, but I came to completely understand his anger, his disappointment and his frustration. This is an engaging personal story. We need stories such as this.We are not told how the author came to write this book nor what he is doing today.I listened to the audiobook narrated by Brian Nishii. I have given the narration four stars. It felt as though the author was speaking to me directly. It felt as though there was nobody in between me and the author. I felt his exhaustion, his anger, his fear and his frustration. There is a need for both non-fiction books that are well researched, without bias and provide an all-inclusive presentation of facts as well as those that have a more personal angle. It is the latter that we have here. This book shows us how it is to live through the events we hear of on the news. There, we are distanced from the facts. Here, events are brought up close, so we understand them on an emotional level.\nHighly recommended reading\n:*A River in Darkness: One Man's Escape from North Korea 4 stars*Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea 4 stars*The Great Leader and the Fighter Pilot: The True Story of the Tyrant Who Created North Korea and The Young Lieutenant Who Stole His Way to Freedom 4 starsEach gives a different perspective.\nMore books on North and South Korea\n: https://www.goodreads.com/review/list..."}, {"userName": "Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell", "userReview": "A devastating account of one man's life in North Korea.

Masaji Ishikawa and his family moved to North Korea during the great migration of Japanese/Korean immigrants to the communist state in the 1960s. Promises of a paradise and jobs for all duped many a family at the time, but the reality was far from what was expected. This is by far one of the best first hand accounts I've read of life in North Korea, and in some respects it completely overwhelmed me. The outpouring of grief, bitter regret and disappointment Masaji feels for himself and his family is palpable on every page. It's his passion to tell his story, and shame both the Korean and Japanese governments for their failings, that make this so readable - but never enjoyable. It follows Masaji from that fateful journey across the sea to North Korea, to his life as a tractor driver and endless search for a happy life with his growing family, to the famine of the late 1980s and early 90s which ultimately leads to his desperate escape. The desperation of a whole nation is described so eloquently here, it's hard to read at times. But it should be read. The cruelty of human nature is all too evident, and shouldn't be ignored. I admire Masaji Ishikawa for the courage it must have taken to recall his past, and defy a nation in doing so. I can only hope that by doing so he's finally found some peace."}, {"userName": "She  Always Reads", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71332255-she-always-reads", "userReview": "While the life that Mr. Ishikawa live was horrifying by anyone standards, I found that at time the book was difficult to read. At moments it seemed as though a cohesive thought was not entirely transformed from reality to word. I think that has a lot to do with the fact that this book was written from translation, so I can\u2019t really fault it.I\u2019m not a history buff, I will never claim to be. I know enough that I was able to graduate from school but never really gave much thought to what was being taught to me. I find the memoirs have become a much more effective way for me to comprehend the history throughout the world as opposed to reading from a textbook that seemed to just ramble facts off. For instance I\u2019m sure I learn of what was happening in Korea prior to reading A River in the Dark. But as I read I became more invested in the journey, more invested in the political aspect, the trying nature of the events that unfolded.I was left elated and heartbroken as I reached the end of one man\u2019s journey to just return home to a life that was striped from him because he was a child. The worst part is that even though this is part of our global existence not enough is being done to rectify the situation for him and everyone who has and still are suffering. One can only hope that something even if it small can be accomplished with that talks between South and North Korea. Yes, after reading this memoir I found myself wanting to know what was happening. This was the first time in a long time that I voluntarily looked up anything along the political line. Now with all the positive being said I still had one question left unanswered. Once you draw to the conclusion of the story Masaji Ishikawa openly tells that he is not suppose reveal that the Japanese authority helped in him in anyway. But by writing this novel is that not what he did. Did he not reveal the one part of the agreement that was the most crucial. There are also other questions that sort of had been left open. While some information was given to the whereabouts of his family that was left in Korea, there really wasn\u2019t a complete conclusion.This was an eye opener for me. I think starting of my year with this has really grounded me. It has really made me realize just how lucky of a person I am in life. I don\u2019t think I could have been as strong as Masaji Ishikawa or his sister or even his children who grew only to know one world."}, {"userName": "Jo (A rather Bookish Geek )\u2764\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28323108-jo-a-rather-bookish-geek", "userReview": "\"Her desperation, her fear, her exhaustion-all of it seeped through her thin clothes and straight into my heart.\"This is not the first non fiction book that I have read, regarding real people's lives in North Korea. It probably won't be my last, either. Much of the information in this particular account wasn't new to me, but this did not stop the utter disbelief washing over me, as I was reading.This very personal memoir is just gut-wrenchingly tragic, and it is told with such honestly, that the horrors Masaji Ishikawa endured over all of those years, is all the more vivid and harrowing for the reader to digest. This memoir gives a powerful insight to what life was actually like in North Korea. I think countries know enough about this and should do more rather than simply turning a blind eye to it, in order to protect themselves.This really is harrowing, and at the same time, compelling.

However, when Ashley at Amazon Publishing gave me this book, I couldn't NOT read it.. and I'm SO happy she sold me on this. Turns out, it may as well be a horror book... unfortunately. Phew - I'm still trying to wrap my feelings around this one.Masaji takes us on his journey. That's thirty-six (36) years of him living in North Korea with his family. Decades of trying not to starve to death. Decades of trying not to get shot, beaten up or turned away simply for being 1/2 Japanese - something that is (obviously) out of his control. Decades of wondering how the government did NOTHING that it promised them. Becoming walking skeletons and deciding that dying trying to escape was better than the alternative - because clearly dying was going to happen anyways. Watching family members, children and seniors alike, dying all around you. Uff. At 178 pages, Masaji manages to put you right in there with him. At one point he even apologies to the reader .. but then saying it was necessary to say to show exactly how bad they had it.My heart hurts for him... for his family... for all the Koreans and Japanese living there in squalor as death surrounds them at every turn.

Masaji, the MC, takes you on this heart wrenching journey of him battling through North Korea. Fair warning, you will cry at some point in this book. He goes through starvation and trying to fight to keep food on the table for his family. He went through discrimination for being half-Japanese. This resulted in him getting beaten up, shot, or turned away from everyone on a daily basis.I probably cried the whole book - or shed tears throughout some chapters. Okay, all of the chapters. OKAY, THE ENTIRE BOOK. Seriously, I don't think I've ever cried so much from one book. I loved everything about this book and the story that was told.

I wanted to demolish the whole universe, but the sad truth was, it had already come crashing down around my head.\u201dMy Review:This story is so personal\u2014you feel as if your friend is telling you a story. It\u2019s not overly dramatic\u2014it doesn\u2019t need to be. The details of this little book are very upsetting and hit straight to the heart. Masaji Ishikawa tells his life from his childhood in Japan, up through his escape from North Korea. He was born in 1947, just after the conclusion of the Second World War, and after Japanese colonial rule in Korea ended. His father, Do Sam-dal, was Korean and his mother, Miyoko Ishikawa, Japanese. It was a tumultuous childhood, full of fear, anger, and pain. Even though his mother\u2019s family was respected, his father was not. His father was very resentful towards his mother and took it out on her. When Masaji was thirteen, his father insisted they move to North Korea under the regime of Kim Il-Sung. He thought he\u2019d have a better life in North Korea, which he had told would be \u201cparadise on Earth\u201d. Except, as Masaji describes it, it was hell on Earth, and after reading his story, I am in 100 percent agreement. His childhood was difficult but it did not hold a handle to the struggles of living in North Korea for thirty-six years and every time I saw the phrase, \u201cLuckily I...\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe how optimistic he was\u2014the human spirit is an amazing thing. I also thought it was interesting to see the change in his father\u2019s temperament over the years in North Korea. And how Masaji finally understood what made his father who he was. I loved how matter-of-factly Masaji speaks. It is very well-written memoir and I believe 170 pages is all it needed to be extremely impactful.

I've previously read Nothing to Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea, This is Paradise!, Somewhere Inside: One Sister's Captivity in North Korea and the Other's Fight to Bring Her Home and parts of Under the Loving Care of the Fatherly Leader: North Korea and the Kim Dynasty, and found them all to be fascinating in a kind of horrible but informative way. So I was interested to see if Ishikawa's memoir would be at all similar or shed new light on the country and life there.At least some of the accounts of life in North Korea that I've read previously have if not happy endings, at least slightly positive and hopeful conclusions. I think this is what people have come to expect from such memoirs, that surely anything would be better than life in North Korea. Yet Masaji Ishikawa's harrowing account does not have such a redemptive conclusion. It is not a spoiler that he escapes to China - and eventually returns to his home country, Japan - however the way the book ends was incredibly shocking to me. I think this book is 100% worth reading for his honesty and the fact that it sheds new light on the plight of North Korean refugees and life after escaping the country.Ishikawa's memoir covers his entire life - from his early childhood in Japan, right up until the present day. I won't share any more details about his story here, but I felt like his account covered a lot of ground in a relatively short book, and shed new light on the experiences of someone who was a particularly maligned member of society in North Korea.

But then, in another way, the frustrations were so unexpected and new for an autobiography, that it almost felt like it was doing something fresh and insightful with the genre... First of all, I can well believe the misery, the constant hunger, and the unremitting, demoralizing, unbearably petty stupidity of the North Korean regime. It all sounds horribly similar to what I've heard from people who've lived through things like that... He's not exaggerating--it's just as awful as he describes, so I'm not surprised that Ishikawa wants to dwell on it. But I got the sense that he is not just focusing on the political situation. He is also reluctant to engage in any of the introspection you normally expect from an autobiography, or even talk about his personal life in any detail at all. He seems to only want to criticize the political system in NK, which is all fine and well, except that his life experience as a low-level worker doesn't make his perspective any more interesting or unique than the generalities you can pick up from a Wikipedia article. Which leaves his personal life as the only story of interest. And that's where things get weird. There are so many inconsistencies and omissions that you come away feeling like you don't know this person at all, and the only thing you're sure of is that he's holding out on you. For example, he says that he was coerced into marrying his first wife, and only went along with it out of pity for her. Then she is supposedly so overcome with guilt for being such a burden to him, that she runs off while he's sick in the hospital, and then dumps their newborn baby on him and skips town. Even though there is no formula available and he has to go from house to house begging for people to breastfeed the baby. This was her idea of being less burdensome? And he and his family went along with it? Didn't even ask her to stick around long enough to breastfeed the baby? Doesn't make any sense... Then there's the story of his sister, whose husband abandons her and dumps his 2 kids from a previous marriage on her. Without paying child support for them? How did he get away with that? In a place where women are apparently so liberated that they can divorce their husbands on a whim and even dump their newborn babies on them? Then the sister supposedly borrows enormous amounts of money, something like more than a year's salary, with no evidence of having spent it on anything, and Ishikawa has to go begging to a rich acquaintance to pay it back. He takes such responsibility for this debt without asking for any explanation from her? She must have had some excuse at the very least... And who would even lend so much money to a single mother with no prospects? For what purpose? And where did it all go? And, most puzzling of all... the seal penis incident. Yes, that's right, a seal penis. An illegally obtained rarity used in Chinese medicine, which some local \"hoodlum\" just hands to Ishikawa's father to sell. Why would a black market dealer just hand his merchandize to some random, poor-but-honest farm laborer? And how is said farm laborer then immediately able to find yet another thug to sell the illegal item to? And then there are the weird coincidences. Is it really just by some freak chance that a man whose father was an enforcer for a Korean gang back in Japan (not to mention the seal penis) and whose sister (and son, in a separate incident) both managed to run afoul of some criminal characters, just happens to get rescued at the border by some very altruistic Korean smugglers in China who are somehow willing to risk their lives to help him get to the Japanese consulate? All these things together suggest some fascinating story... if only the author was willing to tell it. But all we get is these little glimpses, usually told with a wry, self-deprecating humor. (Which incidentally also pops up in his description of the Kim regime... because it's yet another poorly done con job?)And that is the weirdness and the awesomeness of this book. Usually autobiographies are either selectively condensed or overblown to make a novel-like narrative out of the mundanity of someone's daily life. But in this book, the fascinating and the interesting is what's glossed over or blown off to make room for descriptions of mundane miseries. Is that the point the author is trying to make? That even such delicious shadiness as he hints at in his life can't survive in the face of the cud-chewing mundane evil of the Kim regime? I think I'm overthinking it... most likely we're just dealing with a good old-fashioned unreliable narrator."}, {"userName": "Kasa Cotugno", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2345554-kasa-cotugno", "userReview": "When I read Pachinko, the fictionalized account of a family's actual history, it opened my eyes to the lives of Korean nationals who found themselves in Japan and unable to return. Now here is a memoir of a man whose life has thus been defined, but whose situation was even more dire. Born in 1947 of a Korean father and Japanese mother, Masaji Ishikawa endured early life feeling an outcast. Believing the hype that Kim Jong-sung had created a \"paradise on earth\" promising jobs and prosperity, his abusive father \"relocated\" the entire family to North Korea in 1960, even though he had been a native of the South. From the moment they disembarked, their lives were unrelentingly harsh, details of which defy a reader to believe in their survival. As a reader already knows from the title and opening passage, Ishikawa is able to leave the country by swimming a river to China in 1996, but his history and memories are so painful, it makes for grim reading. However, given the state of current relations between North Korea and the world, the more understanding one has of the real lives led behind the borders of that rogue nation, the better."}, {"userName": "Jocelyn Green", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6887032-jocelyn-green", "userReview": "This account was written in a fairly minimalist style, in that it didn't rely on fancy prose to evoke emotion.

I desperately hoped for a different ending in the book, but this isn't fiction, it's a man's lif--and it isn't over yet.

But it lacks the prose that made me subject myself to Solzhenitsyn's second book. While I feel for him and hope that he thrives now that he has escaped from hell, I don't believe that I would read another book by Ishikawa. There was no closure, either. Spoiler alert, here: he left his starving family behind. He does a lot of crying over his dilemmas throughout the book. I don't mean to be lacking in empathy here; I'm aware of the untenable conditions in North Korea and I wish there was more that people of conscience could do to ease the suffering. But as far as this book goes, it seemed to drone on about the lack of food and housing and hopelessness without explaining many of the things that he was able to do. He changed jobs, moved several times, married and divorced, and drove a tractor all over the place. The characters were rather superficially included, with only momentary mention of things that might let you get to know them, and in many instances he just left you with more questions. He comes home because he gets a letter that there is going to be a wedding and he is afraid it is code for a problem. Turns out there is a wedding- his family found him a bride, but she is ugly and has bad vision and a mean family . He marries her because he feels sorry for her but he gets her pregnant and she asks him to divorce her right after she has the baby. And she leaves the baby with him! He goes around begging villagers to nurse his baby. Really? Why didn't he make her stay and nurse the infant at that point? He never really describes what could make her want to divorce him and abandon her child. In fact, other than saying that she had bad vision and wasn't very pretty, he tells you nothing about his first wife and the mother of his first child. Why did he not ask his sister what she did with the money that she supposedly borrowed from thugs or what her plan was instead of writing only about his problem in needing to come up with the money? His second wife leaves to take care of her relative but suddenly can return. Why? Did the relative die? There is just so much in this book that doesn't make sense."}, {"userName": "B.A. Wilson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24206425-b-a-wilson", "userReview": "This is the true story of Masaji Ishikawa, born in Japan to a Japanese mom, and an abusive Korean father, who was lured by false promises of a utopian society to move his family from Japan to North Korea when Ishikawa was only 13 years old. The family became part of the lowest social caste, and all of them suffered immensely under the brutal totalitarian regime. I've read some tough stories about people with very difficult lives, but the abject poverty experienced by Ishikawa completely unsettled me. I'm shocked and horrified by the ways in which North Koreans were (and probably still are) forced to suffer. The constant indoctrination didn't surprise me, but the sheer stupidity and cruelty behind running an entire country and people into the ground was infuriating. It's so hard for me to wrap my mind around how an entire nation of people can be abused and kept down in such a way. They're so far down, they don't ever even consider rising up, probably because any attempt to fight back against the system only leads to more sorrow and loss. If you had asked me to point fingers at which countries are the most guilty of crimes against their own people, North Korea probably wouldn't have made my top 5 list before reading this book. I mean, on some level, I knew things weren't great in North Korea, but I had no idea how bad it really was. My only minor complaint is that I wanted more. More depth, more explanations, more emotions, more stories, and even more information on aspects of Ishikawa's daily life (and especially into his different relationships). I suspect some of what I really wanted to know was left out of this story or glossed over just due to sheer cultural differences. I'm sure it would have been deemed inappropriate for him to speak more in depth about either of his wives, and specifics of his relationships with them, but I definitely wanted to know more about all of that. This is not a story of hope, so what's beautiful about it is the honest way in which the story is told.
