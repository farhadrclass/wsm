In the case of 17-year-old Jasper \u201cJazz\u201d Dent, he\u2019s got both factors working against him. Not only is he the son of the country\u2019s most notorious serial killer, but dear old daddy even forced him to watch those grisly crimes and sometimes\u2026more.I\u2019ve always been interested in how human beings cope with extreme circumstances, and the way children in particular can demonstrate remarkable resilience. I Hunt Killers sets up a fascinating scenario showing how both environment and biology can contribute to certain conditioned responses and behaviors\u2014and how an innate sense of human decency might be strong enough to overcome even the worst of upbringings. At least that\u2019s what Jazz keeps telling himself. Because now that he suspects that a new serial killer is at work in his small town, he\u2019s flashing back to memories that make him extremely uneasy. Did he help kill someone he loved without knowing it? Is he destined to follow in his father\u2019s footsteps? What sets this novel apart from all the other paint-by-numbers mysteries is that Jazz is an incredibly complex, believable character. The book has been billed as \u201cDexter for YA\u201d and it\u2019s an apt comparison; Jazz is likable, relatable, and consumed by the idea that he may not be able to stop himself from doing harm to others. The story itself is engaging, with the masterfully detailed, well-researched criminology aspects related in an accessible way. The book is also HILARIOUS from beginning to end. I didn\u2019t expect to be laughing so much at a book about a possible serial killer in the making, but it\u2019s impossible to resist the graveyard banter running through Jazz\u2019s seasoned, offhand narrative.\nMaking a duplicate key from a wax impression was an extremely useful skill to have if you were the sort of person who liked invading other people\u2019s homes and killing them.\nAnd later, his best friend Howie earnestly asks him what his middle name is, because he\u2019s sure that serial killers all have three names! The choice to use humor to hook the reader into the story is brilliant, and I thoroughly enjoyed being in Jazz\u2019s conflicted and absurdly playful head.Despite its humorous tone and exceptional writing, however, my guess is that this is going to be an extremely polarizing book. Its refusal to look away from the often horrific nature of brutal crimes and twisted mind games will be shocking to readers who aren\u2019t used to these kinds of details. Early in the book we\u2019re eased into some crimes because they\u2019re mostly told in past tense, but the later scenes definitely escalate in tension and violence, although I don\u2019t think they really cross the line in terms of being gratuitous rather than graphic. If I had to quibble about anything, I\u2019d say that Jazz\u2019s give and take relationship with the police is something readers will need to accept, although their doubtful reliance upon him is portrayed in a fairly believable tone. And as with all murder novels, I wasn\u2019t particularly keen on the few scenes told from the killer\u2019s point of view. But those things are really almost incidental when the writing is nearly pitch-perfect in balancing ghoulish humor and a macabre subject.It\u2019s so exciting to see YA that pushes boundaries in this way. While I confess that I'm a little uneasy about the idea of 13-year-old being exposed to this sort of information, I don\u2019t think the book contains too much explicit material that older teens or adults already haven\u2019t seen in other forms of entertainment. I strongly urge readers to carefully consider whether this is a subject that they want to read about, however, because this book certainly isn\u2019t for the faint of heart. But for the right audience, this thriller will hit all the right notes for an unforgettable reading experience. Its dark, disturbing, and devilishly funny vibe is pure genius.This review also appears in The Midnight Garden. An advance copy was provided by the publisher.

There, I said it. I am perpetually fascinated by the stories that seem too far-fetched to be true. Elizabeth B\u00e1thory allegedly bathed in the blood of virgins to retain her youth. Ted Bundy kept the decapitated heads of his victims in his house as mementos. Ed Gein dug up dead bodies and made a belt out of nipples. This is the stuff nightmares are made of. So it was with a certain excitement that I started reading I Hunt Killers. Barry Lyga created a fun friendship, a believable relationship (and interracial, which is exciting to note as interracial relationships are few and far between in YA), and two pretty darn scary serial killers. One is the protagonist's father, Dear Old Dad, who killed over 120 people and is now in prison. The other is a new killer, one who just started murdering people in Jazz's own town. The locals will never forget what his father did, nor will some of them ever treat him as anything other than someone about to follow in his father's footsteps. Jazz himself is worried about becoming a killer. He knew about a lot of his father's victims and he keeps having nightmares (or are they memories?) about helping his father kill something/someone but he can't put the pieces together. He knows the history and evidence from his father's kills in and out and believes he understands the mind of a serial killer, so when the new killer starts racking up victims, Jazz attempts to help the local police solve the crime. The chief humors him more than I believe to be likely, but the funnier parts of the novel, and it IS funny, involve Jazz and his hemophiliac best friend Howie doing a little crime-solving work on their own. A lot of humor is also added by Jazz's grandmother, with whom he lives. She has increasing memory loss and often does wacky things and mistakes people for others. Of all the points in the novel that I could've been offended by, I was a little disheartened by the fact that Jazz essentially drugs his grandmother several times to keep her sleeping. Also, in regards to his grandmother, I felt like the child services worker, though well-intentioned, was unrealistic. Anybody who has worked in or around the system would probably raise an eyebrow at a worker making such an effort over someone who is healthy, not abused, able to support himself, and 6 months from aging out of the system. Sad, but true. Fans of thrillers and horror novels will probably enjoy this, regardless of its YA categorization. When I was trying to think of readalikes, the only thing similar in the YA genre that I am aware of is the John Cleaver series by Dan Wells and I signed out of that series after the first book added in a paranormal element. This book had more gory elements, funny dialogue, more realism, and it was scarier. I was fully engaged for the entirety of the novel so to me, it is the clear winner. I Hunt Killers ends with a bang. It can stand alone but I sincerely hope that Lyga writes more about Jazz and company. Please don't leave me hanging like this, Mr. Lyga!Thanks to Wendy Darling at The Midnight Garden for touring her ARC of this book. I loved it!Read this review and tons of other book-related awesomeness at The Readventurer."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4605519-jamie", "userReview": "Guilty confession: When I first started this, I was not expecting much. The summary left me skeptical to a good plot but I was determined to try because I had already heard lots of great things about the sequel to this one. What I can say now is that I am so glad I did. This book is so much more than what it seems on the surface! As I began, I was torn or the style in which the story was presented. At first it seemed short and abrupt. Normally this would annoy me but after the first couple chapters I was quickly captivated by the thought process of young Jasper (more commonly known as Jazz) Dent. Once you get to understand him, the style it is written in makes so much more sense and fits to his personality and lifestyle.This poor guy has lived a life of hell! A serial killer for a father who's victims were in the triple digits. After his father is caught is stuck with his deranged grandmother. What a crazy coot she is! He is so worried his mentality is like his fathers. He has seen WAY too much horror for his age. How can it not twist a person?When a new serial killer makes an appearance in his town, Jazz is determined to help solve it. To absolve himself, to clear his name or prove just what kind of person he really is no one knows. Jazz is smart and methodical but no matter how much he tries, he can never escape his father's shadow. Especially when the killers methods strike too close to home for comfort!I cannot express enough how much I enjoyed this. A great psychological thriller and mystery. The mental battles Jazz goes through are so well described. You really feel you are right there in his brain, working through everything with him. Jazz is terrified of his own capabilities to kill. Questioning if he has killed, figuring how easy it would be to kill... Then trying to solve the crimes and save his friends! This book goes through a wide range of mental processes one might experience under such a life. Almost makes you wonder about the author... (just kidding!). There is action, violence and death in this book. While it is Young Adult in nature, it is older adult. Do not let the writing style and the lighter chapters at the beginning fool you. This goes dark! It is filled with twists and turns and unexpected moments. I cannot wait to continue the series!"}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Yeah, I enjoyed it.

I have to admit, this wasn't what I expected. Given the premise, I anticipated something more flimsy, something along the lines of Encyclopedia Brown, Boy Detective. I got a young Dexter/John Cleaver, with considerably more emotional baggage. This book works for me more as a psychological analysis than anything. Yeah, the plot is there, and it is good. The mystery kept me guessing and I loved seeing things through the eyes of the killer, but the psychoanalytical aspects of this book blew the actual storyline out of the water. Psych 101? Please. I gained more insight into the human mind from this book than from anything I learned in that class.Or maybe I just slept through that class. Whatever, I PASSED, OK?Jasper's father is a serial killer, the worst (meaning the best, and not the most terrible) serial killer of all time. He has killed 123...or 124, people before stupidly getting caught, and now poor Jazz is left to grow up pretty much on his own in a town where his name is notorious for being the child of a serial killer who got caught. Nobody held him accountable for his father's crimes since he is a juvenile, and not an actual accessory to his father's crimes despite the fact that his dad has been practically grooming him to take over the \"family business\" since he's been in action---meaning started killing people. Jasper (Jazz) is extremely intelligent for his age, he's got the street savvy, he's got the smooth-talking skills down, he's got dear old dad's skills of persuasion, and some others that he wish he didn't. Now, there's another killer loose in the town of Lobo's Nod, Jazz thinks it's a serial killer but nobody believes him, and he's out to investigate.Not the smartest move if you want to stay under the radar, but I suppose if he acted intelligently and kept his head low, this book wouldn't exist.Jazz: I loved Jazz's character, his complexity, his conflicting desires. This book is an insight into his head, the psychological torment that he goes through day by day knowing that he is his father's son. He struggles with his desires to do good and the darker parts of him that might be a little too close to his father than he likes. The conflict inside him is beautifully written. From the charismatic, normal front he puts up daily to fool others, to his deeper inner struggles with his father's programming. He's got a dark sense of humor, and I rather like that as a bit of a break within such a dark tale. Children are so impressionable, and even if his father got caught, the years and years of grooming affected his mind more than he wants to believe. He doesn't want to be like his father...who, besides the most twisted, mentally ill children wants to emulate a serial killer when they grow up---but Jazz can't help growing up the way he did, having witnessed what he did, and having the same blood running through his veins. Jazz knows his own terrifying potential, should he allow it to grow.\"'But you don't want to kill people,' she'd said with finality, and Jazz had let the conversation die right there. Because the only honest response would have been:It's not that I want to or don't want to. It's just\u2026I can. I could. It's like\u2026I imagine it's like being a great runner. If you knew you could run really fast, wouldn\u2019t you? If you were stuck walking somewhere, wouldn't you want to let loose and run like hell? That's how I feel.\"Jazz wants to do good, but he has to constantly fight the monster that's lurking within himself, however much he wants to suppress it.\"She was dying. Dying right in front of him, and he didn't trust himself to help her because he didn't trust his hands not to finish the job instead...She was in the full throes of cardiac arrest.Jazz didn't think. He didn't torture himself. He tilted her head back and listened for breathing. Nothing. A moment of intense pleasure washed over him, followed by a revulsion so sickening that he almost threw himself headlong out the window.\"The insight into his life post-dad is pretty interesting, too. You know all the sicko serial killer fans? He's got that, just by being the infamous son. He's got media following him, exposing him (is that even legal? to show a juvenile in this circumstance in the media? Fucking Doug Weathers). He's got people wanting to give him money. He's got grieving parents contacting him for closure.He's got people angry at him, asking why he didn't just stop his dad. Simple: \"like the children of alcoholics and the victims of abuse, Jazz had been a master at compartmentalizing. That, combined with Billy's persistent brainwashing and total control, meant Jazz had never uttered a peep to anyone.\"The plot: interesting, but I can't help thinking JAZZ YOU IDIOT. JUST STAY AWAY. MOVE TO ANOTHER TOWN. When you're the child of a serial killer, wouldn't it be wisest to just stay out of the picture? Especially for a kid so smart, so savvy, so good at manipulating people and appearing normal like Jazz supposedly is? It doesn't make sense to me why he'd want to get so involved. Disbelief aside, the mystery itself, the procedures, the glimpses into the serial killer's work was well-done. The clues were given gradually, and that in combination with the flashes of POV through the killer's eyes makes this an excellent armchair detective novel. I was constantly guessing for the whodunnit through all the little bits and pieces given. There is gore, there is blood and torture, but it's nothing the average viewer of CSI or Criminal Minds haven't seen before.I liked all the characters. The villains, the cops, not everything is black and white. People grow, people change. Even Jazz himself is not immune to foolishness, regret, and hubris. My main concern before starting this book was the premise...a boy, just a boy, doing better detective work than the police themselves? I expected detectives to be bumbling fools, I expected people to compartmentalize Jazz, I epected this to be a Them against Me story. I was wrong. Everything and everyone had more depth than I expected.Oh, and the ending. Did I see that coming? Nope, nope, not from 10 miles away. Damn."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Sequel, please? Now? I thought this book was really really good. I would have happily handed out five stars, except for the fact that I had the killer's identity figured out less than halfway through the book. I feel very sad that Ms Dense seems to have been randomly replaced with Marple, but thankfully this novel is about a lot more than just solving the main mystery.I actually took longer to read this book than I tend to do, and most of that time was spent on the first few chapters. So I shall be issuing a warning to those who feel underwhelmed at first - stick with this book, it really does get better and better. The problem was, depraved individual that I am, I felt the introduction to the story and characters to be really light. I'm the kind of reader who likes my mysteries dark and full of gore and psychopaths... and Jasper Dent's character reminded me of a much smarter version of Cassel from White Cat. I love Cassel, but he never strikes me as a \"serious\" character, and this is how I felt towards Jasper. At first.But it soon became apparent that Barry Lyga really knows how to balance light and dark in a way I'm not even familiar with. There was humour in this book and Jasper Dent was in many ways a regular teenage boy with a best friend and a girlfriend. Since his dad was arrested, he has lived with his grandmother - a woman suffering from the effects of old age and a sometimes cruelly psychotic personality - but this is all rather amusing, instead of tragic. However, the author's ability to suddenly flip the switch between light-hearted teen humour and really dark descriptions of murder and sociopathic tendencies had quite an effect on me. It could have seemed silly and forced, yet for me it just made it more dramatic and disturbing.Perhaps this is just me because I don't recall reading reviews that have picked up on this dark twistedness. But I honestly thought there was something extremely horrifying and effective about the contrast between light and dark tones in the novel. Jasper Dent is also a very complex character, he has all kinds of conflicting emotions flying around inside him. He is the kind of person who questions his motives for everything: is he helping someone because he wants to help them? Or is he helping them for what he gets out of it? If a person is brought up knowing only one way of life, are they destined to follow that path? Can they change?There are a few problems I had with the story. I don't believe the sheriff would really have been that understanding in a real life situation, and I don't believe he wouldn't have been just a tad more suspicious of Jasper in the beginning. Also, would that social worker really have been that concerned for a guy so close to eighteen who could obviously look after himself? I'm not sure they would have.These things are very small matters that don't actually take anything away from the novel. This is a seriously gripping story... so, you know what you should do: read it!"}, {"userName": "Aj the Ravenous Reader", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30248594-aj-the-ravenous-reader", "userReview": "Jasper Dent is the most popular teenage boy in school. Wait! Not just in school but in the whole town although for the last reason you could think of. Well, he\u2019s only the son of the most notorious killer, Billy Dent who kind of reminds me of Dennis Hopkins as Hannibal. *Cowers*  *Shivers* Billy has been locked up in prison for four years now but somebody, a fanboy? is copying one of his serial kills as the Artist and calls himself the Impressionist.

To me, this is almost unheard of.What gripped me really tight to the story is the detailed presentation of Jazz\u2019s upbringing causing the wars constantly battling inside his head whenever he has to come up with judgment of what is right and wrong. Jasper\u2019s crazy Gramma although most of the things she said and did were plain horrifying provided dark comic relief while his hilarious best friend, Howie [who reminds me so much of my favorite singer, Natasha Bedingfield\u2019s I Bruise Easily (in the most literal sense)] provided the light and easy ones.Identifying the killer was kind of easy and a bit predictable but it did not interfere with the suspense of the story.For the author to be able to come up with an idea like this alone is already impressive.I would really want to read the sequels but they're too long (for me) and lately I've been such a lazy reader and couldn't seem to read anything more than 400 pages. :( Someday, I hope I could.^^"}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "\"A serial killer's greatest ability is the ability to blend in\"I love being in the mind of a serial killer. Is this bizarre? Maybe a little. But with an older sister at home, I skipped the fairy tales, instead I grew up watching Freddy Krueger and reading murder mysteries. Naturally, I Hunt Killers immediately attracted my interest with its serial killer's son synopsis. Then when I removed the dust jacket and saw this:\u266b We're here for a good time!You have to admit, there is something fascinating about serial killers. The way they think, how they analyze and see the world. It's no secret that they're sociopaths, but in most cases they have very high IQs, making them highly interesting to study. These people are masterminds. In I Hunt Killers, being in the most notorious serial killer's son's head, we learn a lot about the ins and outs of this lifestyle. Jazz is such a captivating protagonist. He's deeply disturbed by what his father has done, not just the killings themselves, but how he has was raised - to be his protege. He doesn't want to be like his father, but is it too late? Is the damage done? It's sad and it's terrifying to be inside Jazz's head. I questioned it all as much as he did. Is he sane? Is he dangerous? His best friend Howie is quite the opposite. He's simple minded and a great supportive friend to Jazz. I adored him. Plain and simple. Together, they can be pretty amusing. I loved the added humor in this novel. It's just the right amount to give it charm, while keeping the overall plot gritty and dangerous. Howie: \"What if the whole thing was just an accident?\"Jazz: \"And what? Accidentally cut off three fingers postmortem? 'Oops, oh no, my girlfriend just died! Clumsy me, in trying to perform CPR, I chopped off some fingers!

She's senile, suspected to suffer from Alzheimer's with bouts of delirium; she was never really right in the head to begin with.

Like crawling on the floor army-style with a kitchen knife; it's distressing, really - but her delusions are priceless. \"They're gonna rape mongrel babies into me! Mongrel babies to kill white folks! And they're gonna give me the AIDS to kill me off!\" Grandma rantedFaint of heart? Does it bother you to think of feeding human eyeballs to a cat? You may want to steer clear of this one. Although it's considered YA, there is a fair amount of gore and plenty of blood running through these pages. Jazz can't get away from his father constantly invading his thoughts, and now he has to find the one mimicking him; the story is definitely explicit and I appreciate that Lyga didn't shy away from it. This rawness - it gives a convincing portrayal of a teenage killer's son's story. The mystery itself is not insurmountable. There are two or three obvious choices that become quite apparent, but there is still an extra twist I didn't expect, and the bigger storyline of Jazz figuring himself out is what's at the heart of this book.

There's that.\u2718 of someone else's personal goods or property : Hours of my time\u2718 valued above (for grand) or below (for petty) a specific amount (which is $100 in many States) : my time is worthless, duh, meaning it's priceless. \u2718 with the intent to deprive the owner permanently of the goods or property.

Oh, man, talk about daddy issues. What a tortured kid, and for reasons. Being in his head, hearing his father pieces of advices, following him while he tries to act as a human, to read people correctly in order to appear normal, to be normal, to kill no one, because People Matter guys... That was fascinating to see him struggle between his desire to be good and the darkest parts of his mind who made him wonder.... If... If he gave in... If he let them flow...

The things that he'd been taught and then forgotten, but that lurked somewhere in his brain's basement, ready to strike like stalkers in the night.\"\nHaunted - Jasper's haunted.

Broken in a way nobody can understand. Because he won't let them see. Don't get fooled though : Jasper is no innocent victim. He's manipulative and flashing his mega-watt smile comes just as easily to him as breathing - he became a master of \"looking normal\", and has a millions expressions in his arsenal to use when needed. As his father, he's charming, handsome, and looks completely above suspicion. Actually he reminded me of Dexter in the way he has to read people to know how to act sometimes : Is Connie happy? Hmm, yeah, she seems to be. I mean, the girl does smile. That's a good sign right? (Little tips : that's not always a good sign). He's got also this dark humor I loved in Dexter, this ability to see life through a twisted glass, to see people as they truly are, free of their false pretenses...

Can he swear never telling it again? Yeah? Good. In my opinion she's perfect for him. About their relationship, it seems important to mention that contrary to many YA books, the author didn't take the simplistic approach of the overwhelming romance we often find : indeed instead of creating a new romance, he chose to show us the developments of an already existing relationship, adding more depth to its treatment in my opinion. \n\"Maybe it was a guy/girl thing.He hoped that's all it was.

Now, I don't think guessing would spoil the read because what's important here is the journey through Jazz's mind in my opinion. That's where this book is filled with originality. You want to read a regular investigation? Go in the bookstore, check the thrillers. There's tons of them. Will you find other Jaspers? I don't think so. \u2714 I can't deny that the way police officers let Jazz investigate can appear completely unbelievable, being a teenager and all.\u2714 Of course we can wonder WHY in the world doesn't Jazz hide or, I don't know, moves in another town. Let's face it, if he did I wouldn't write this review, because there would be no book, so, well... Moreover, I really think that guilt can grandly influence people behavior, so his need to show that he's good, that he isn't like his father? That's believable to me. \u2714 I developed an unhealthy crush on Jazz. Bad me. \nVerdict\n : Why, of course I recommend.

It had a nice blend of mystery, action, and suspense. We followed the exploits of 17 year old Jasper Dent, son of the worlds most notorious serial killer, as he tried to help the police in his local town hunt down a copycat killer of his father. The story was interesting enough. Jasper was a decent lead character. He had a horrible childhood and his evil father had taught him to be just like him and so Jasper was worried that he himself was destined to become a killer. Lyga really did a good job selling that aspect of the story. The big flaw in this book was the secondary characters. I never really managed to form any sort of emotional attachment to them. The mystery aspect of the story was pretty well done. I never guessed the identity of the copycat killer until just before the big reveal and even then Lyga had another big twist up his sleeve that should make for an interesting sequel story! All in all this as an entertaining YA read. Rating: 4 stars. I feel like I'm being a bit generous here but this is better than a lot of the books I rate 3.5 stars.

YOU WEREN'T SUPPOSED TO CROSS THE TAPE. THIS IS A CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION.Oh who are we kidding...no one ever pays attention to warnings, especially book characters.Our lead character Jasper (Jazz) is no exception. Except in his case, he is smarter than the average bear cop. After all, you might know a thing or two when your dad is one of the most famous serial killers of all time. His skills are bound to come in handy when hunting down a serial killer who is copying his dad's moves.Welcome to...Three fingers on the right hand were missing - the index finger, the middle finger, and the ring finger. The thumb and pinky were all that remained; that hand would flash devil horns while the corpse rotted in the ground somewhere.Apparently, being smart enough to catch a killer does not include knowing the difference between the \"devil horn\" sign and the \"hang loose\" sign. Ah well, I'll let that slide. Jazz is still pretty useful. So what if his brain's a little fried? Mine would be too if I had to watch my dad mutilate people and animals when I was a small child, and because of this I now couldn't get my father's voice out of my head.\n\nStruggling is what makes it worth doing, Billy said. Jazz closed his eyes, trying to chase away his father's voice, but it was no good.\n\nThis is not an easy read. The details of the murders are startling and graphic. It's a pretty dark story. I was, however, completely bowled over by this peek into a life so far out of the realm of ordinary. The poor kid...everyone around him seemed to be pulling him back and forth. His father and grandmother believed him to be a monster, while his best friend and girlfriend were doing everything in their power to counteract that belief.Even Jazz himself didn't truly know who he was. Was his father right? Was his destiny not in helping to catch the killers, but instead to become one himself?\n\nIt's not that I want to or don't want to. It's just...I can. I imagine it's like being a great runner. If you knew you could run really fast, wouldn't you? If you were stuck walking somewhere, wouldn't you want to let loose and run like hell? That's how I feel.\n\nI'm so happy that this book is going to become a series. It's going to be quite the experience to watch as Jazz figures out his own head. I like that he's conflicted. Not everything is black and white in his world.The multiple viewpoints were especially interesting. Getting the chance to be inside of the killer's head added a bit of extra creepiness to the story. Bonus points go for fitting in a Silence of the Lambs reference. The last few chapters definitely had a SotL vibe. I was digging on it.\n\n\"Have the lambs stopped screaming, Clarice?\" Howie said suddenly in a dead-on Hannibal Lecter impression.\n\nBook 2 is going to be CRAAAAAAZY.

This book was nothing like what I expected, but I still really enjoyed it.Jasper \"Jazz\" Dent is your average teenager. He still deals with trying to figure out who he is and what to do when your dating. The one problem that he faces that no other teenager faces is that his dad is the world's worst serial killer. His dad brought him to work daily and showed him the ways of murdering and getting away with it. Jazz had the experience of witnessing crime from the criminal's point of view. However, his dad finally got caught (after being in the triple digits with murdering), but somehow there are still bodies piling up in Lobo's Nod. The bodies have a remarkable resemblance to Jazz's dad's first couple murders. The victims have the same initials, occupation, sex and age as the victims that Jazz's dad originally killed. And they are in the same order; killed by the same method. Who was this killer infatuated with his dad? Jazz wanted to know and he decides to join the police in a hunt for the new serial killer.This book was really enjoyable! I plan to read the next book in the series when it comes in from the library.

While other kids were riding bikes and playing, Jazz was taking care of his father\u2019s murder trophies and learning how to become an invisible, invincible predator. When Jasper was twelve, Billy finally escalated and got caught by the local sheriff, G. William. Four years later, Jazz is still tormented by his father\u2019s teachings, and his only goal is to escape Billy Dent\u2019s legacy. He needs to remind himself over and over again that people matter, especially when a new killer starts imitating Billy\u2019s crimes. Jasper is the first to notice the pattern and as the bodies start piling up, he becomes obsessed with stopping the copycat. In Jasper, Lyga created a well-rounded, consistent and truly believable character. He is smart and incredibly observant, but severely damaged, and very easy to love. But he's not the only one worth mentioning. Of all the fabulous characters that were built around Jazz, his girlfriend Connie was the one who really stole my heart. It is rare that a teen character, especially a secondary character, is so strong, self-assured and genuinely kind. Jazz is convinced that she\u2019s the one keeping him sane and grounded (or as sane as he can be), and I have to say that I wholeheartedly agree with him. As much as I loved Jazz\u2019s best friend Howie (and really, how does a serial killer\u2019s son get a type A hemophiliac for his best friend?), Connie is one of those characters that make me proud to be a woman. Getting brief glimpses of the killer\u2019s point of view is certainly not uncommon in crime novels, and I can think of at least ten cases when I really appreciated the insight. Usually, these chapters are either about the gore or about allowing the reader to really feel the fear of the victims. This time, however, I didn\u2019t feel that the few brief passages told from The Impressionist\u2019s point of view brought anything useful to the story. Yes, they were interesting, but they were mostly about The Impressionist's obsession with Jazz himself, which is something we could have figured out on our own. We saw the gory details through Jazz\u2019s eyes (and memories) anyway. There was, however, one thing Lyga did better than most: while Jazz was investigating, even when he was one step ahead of the police, Barry Lyga never made the police look stupid and incompetent. He found a way to create a hero that is special in some way without degrading the small-town sheriff and his people. The narrator, Charlie Thurston, did an amazing job differentiating the voices of all the characters. He didn\u2019t just change his voice, he slightly changed his accent too, and he adapted it to each character according to age and education. The changes in accents were minute, but they were there, and they were very impressive. He also handled the emotional scenes in a way that made me believe and really feel them. My only problem is that he made Billy Dent, Jazz\u2019s personal boogeyman and the world\u2019s most notorious serial killer sound funny! I\u2019m not sure if this is an audio issue or a book issue, which is why I\u2019d like to hear from those of you who\u2019ve read the book. Regardless, next time I see the name Charlie Thurston on an audiobook, I won\u2019t hesitate to pick it up.

Look how badass this is!!! Thanks, Frenchy Bug!! We take our pimp job seriously, you know....\nJazz was afraid of two things in the world, and two things only. One of them was that people thought that his upbringing meant that he was cursed by nature, nurture, and predestined to be a serial killer like his father. The second thing...was that they were right.\nEEEEEEE! This made me immensely happy....in a super sick, masochistic way. Like, really?? Why have I never heard about this book before?? I'm not going to lie, I'm truly at a loss for words and I really don't know what to say. There are certain books where I can't seem to shut my mouth because I love them so much, and some books where I love them just as much but can't seem to find the proper words to identify and characterize these feelings of overwhelming awesomeness.It was a beautiful day. It was a beautiful field. Except for the body.What is it about this book that made me fall so deeply in love with it? I can't help but think it's because this book appeals to the crazy side of me I found when I was about a year into Goodreads-you know, when I decided to change my name to Chelsea Peril Please?? Yeah, this book fits into that category. That category where people are being abducted and murdered and our dear Jazz is using his knowledge from his childhood to figure out who might be next. But, wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. Jazz is the child of a serial killer. Everyone knows Billy Dent....and they especially know his son, Jasper Dent. Poor little Jazz-he grew up in a home where he was expected to watch, learn, help with Billy's victims, giving him a vast and extensive knowledge on how to successfully murder someone. Jazz could read people. It wasn't something he worked at; it was just as natural as breathing. It was as ordinary as reading a billboard on the highway: You don't really think about the billboard; you just notice it and your brain processes it, and that's that.And here is why I loved this book so much-Jazz. What a beautiful, broken character. He was perfection. He is exactly the type of male lead I've been looking for, lately. He is traumatized (inwardly) by his past and what his father made him do. People look at him differently because they don't know why he didn't stop him even if he knew it was wrong. They're wondering if he'll be next, if he'll finally snap like dear old, Dad. And it takes a toll on him, naturally. He is tormented by his own fears that he is no different from his father, that he will one day snap and become an unstoppable killer with no remorse...because even though he isn't his father and he doesn't want to kill, he still gets excited by it. He gets drawn into the blood lust and art that is a serial killer's MO, and it gets harder and harder to fight. What if he's no different from his father??God! Goddamn it! Goddamn Billy Dent and goddamn his son, too. Tears sprang to Jazz's eyes. She was dying. Dying right in front of him, and he didn't trust himself to help her because he didn't trust his hands not to finish the job instead.\"Just do it!\" he yelled to himself, his voice raw and bleak in the close quarters of the apartment. \"Save her, you useless piece of-\"So, yeah. Tortured souls are what really draw me in. He desperately wants to be good, to do good, so he tries to help the police force along. This story was excellent. It was different. It was intriguing. It was beyond addicting. So what held back that final star, you ask?? Well...it's as simple as time. I was dragged away from this story numerous times and I couldn't seem to find more than 20 minute intervals where I could get some peace and quiet to read-and, I'll admit it, the last hour I had to read with the tv on in the background because a certain someone just wouldn't go to sleep and I couldn't wait any longer....but it was still so good. I never once was happy I had to put it down and I thought about it when I wasn't able to read it-so I think that more than made up for my disconnect from lack of reading time.\"Who am I? I'll tell you. I'm the local psychopath, and if you don't save my best friend's life, I will hunt down everyone you've ever cared about in your life and make you watch while I do things to them that will have you begging me to kill them. That's who I am.\"The other thing?? This book had such a sinister feel to it. And all my best friends on here know I have this....history, where I find myself screaming in the middle of the night due to a recurring nightmare. It's terrifying. And, for whatever reason, this book brought that dream back. So I was a little apprehensive about finishing-I mean, I knocked over a lamp and broke the bulb in the middle of the night...not exactly an ideal scenario nor does it make me seem like a sane person. Here, think of it like this: I (wake up?) open my eyes and see this...like...fuzzy, grainy image of someone standing beside the bed, but I can't see their face. And then they slowly reach for me. Yeah. That's it. But I always wake up and my throat is sore and I am on the other side of the bed, practically crawling over my hubbs to 'get away.' \n(WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK-some of the gifs that came up when I was searching for an apt portrayal...yikes!!!! I mean, I didn't even use the most accurate images because, I mean, wow. People are WEIRD.) Not a great example above, but I can't use those creeptastic images. \nPeople matter. People are real.\nWeird as it may be, I think the idea that Jazz felt like someone was watching him got to me. And I haven't been getting much sleep-I think those two elements combined got me at a weak moment. That is why I am waiting until next week to start book two-I want to be well-rested. But don't think for a minute I'm happy about waiting....because you couldn't be more wrong. I already miss Jazz.

The characters that captivated me the most in the past months were Meg, from the Others series Conner Cobalt, from Fuel the fire, Lily, from Tin Lily, The Twins, from The Night Circus, Lucy, from More than Forever and Thomas, from The piper's son. What are the similarities between all of them? They are all characters who are mesmerizing to read about. They think differently and see normal situations in such a complex way, so different from our, or at least my, perspectives, that to have a glimpse of their minds, to see how their thoughts are formed, is one chance in a million. It's like winning the lottery. To see how their thoughts are different from what they let people see, to see Jasper and Connor manipulate people to get what they want, to see Lily, Lucy even Meg having completely different reactions to gigantic situations? It's like admiring one person from a distance and having the chance of seeing how their mind works for a day. And their mind working is so fascinating, so much more perplexing then what you had previously expected, that you want to be in their minds forever. Are serial killers normal looking?What if your dad was a serial killer who killed 123 (or 124?) people? Jasper Dent is the son of a serial killer. And while growing up, his dad taught him everything he needed to know about it. And after 4 years of his dad being arrested, Jasper doesn't know if he is good or bad, if he's going to be a killer or not. Taught by his father, he knows how to manipulate, how to make people think what he wants, has the urge to kill. And still, he fights it with everything he has. \"The dice had already been tossed, the cards shuffled and drawn. He was what he was, whether he knew it yet or not. Maybe he was just a guy with a crazy dad, like other kids with crazy dads. Or maybe he was something else.\" Jasper Dent became one of my favorite characters and I'm kind of obsessed with him. I could empathize with his struggles and I wanted to hug him until he couldn't breathe anymore. He was manipulative and complicated and beyond clever, but he also cares, whether he knows it or not. He cares about his best friend (Howie) and Connie, his girlfriend. He even cares about his crazy grandma. Imagine growing up with a dad so smart that he could kill 123 people in a period of, I don't know, 10 years? And imagine struggling with not being who your father taught you to be for 13 years? Imagine being so good at investigating murderers because you've lived with a murderer? Know how they think, how they formulate their killings? Billy Dent fooled people everyday and killed people all over USA, one of the most notorious serial killer of all times. And you are his son. So, the story passes when there's a new serial killer in town, and Jasper decided to help the police finding him/her (it always could be a her, guys.) I had three suspicions in mind, and none of them were the serial killer. I am not good at this stuff. Oh, and this serial killer is following Billy's Dent steps, imitating his first deaths. A follower. Man, the end of this book surprised me like I wasn't surprised reading books in a very long time. How did that happen? Was it calculated or not? Is Jasper correct? (of course he is, but still, the question hangs in the air). I am not used to this genre, but still, this book is fantastic and everyone should read it. It involves your emotional, it raises your suspicions and makes you suspect everyone. It shows us a wonderful character who deserves to be known. - Am I dying for the next book? Absolutely. - And the second characters? Howie made me laugh hard and was another character I was amazed at. He was an extraordinary friend and, besides everything stopping him, he was very brave. A character I truly admired. - And Connie? Being Jasper's girlfriend is a tough task, and she handled it perfectly. Jasper isn't who he is afraid to be because of his affection towards her and his love for Howie. We can see Jasper struggles a lot, and so does Connie. She's always there, she makes him laugh. She doesn't give up when he is having inner battles. She was incredible. Well, I think I've said enough. I'm ready for book two!

Our home was even painted in the colors that he preferred, so my sister and I would stay up late and scare ourselves silly with the possibilities. But even before all of this, I\u2019ve always been fascinated with murder mysteries, so when I Hunt Killers came out my interest was immediately piqued. A story centered on the son of one of the most horrific serial killers in history? Sign me up! That being said, I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve been so utterly creeped out by a story!Jasper Dent was raised by a monster, his father Billy, privy to his activities, schooled in his evil ways. Billy was finally caught, and for the last four years Jazz has been living free of his control, and determined to be nothing like him. He\u2019s very afraid that Billy\u2019s influence or genes predispose him to become a killer, though. Jazz despises what his father did, but it did leave a mark on his thinking. When a killing happens in Jazz\u2019s home town he knows in his heart that this is just the beginning. The murder has all the marks of a serial killer, and Jazz is determined to stop him. As a reader you realize that Jazz desperately wants to prove that he\u2019s unlike Billy, and stopping someone like his father might help in that regard.Being inside Jazz\u2019s mind was a bit disturbing at times. Having to relive some of his memories about his father made me ill. I felt so horrible for Jazz, and wished someone could\u2019ve yanked him out of his father\u2019s clutches sooner! His father was a true sociopath with absolutely no regard for the life of other, even more horrible is the fact he got pleasure from their pain and suffering. Unfortunately, some of his thinking rubbed off on Jasper and he has a constant inner struggle to look at people and know that they matter. But he does know how a killer thinks which makes him a perfect hunter of their kind. I was rooting for Jasper to catch the killer but seriously scared for him as well. I knew it was just a matter of time before Jazz registered on the killer\u2019s radar, making this a suspenseful and frightening read. I kept trying to figure out murderer\u2019s identity along with Jazz and I had a few suspects in mind, but didn\u2019t know for sure until the end. I did really enjoy this story, but I found find Jazz\u2019s involvement in the investigation a little unbelievable. I highly doubt any law enforcement body would\u2019ve included and allowed a teenager to be any part of such a serious investigation. Still, I Hunt Killers was an addictive story, albeit completely disturbing. The murders were shocking and brutal. The ending makes the future for Jazz\u2019s full of even more frightening possibilities. I do think I\u2019ll hold off on reading the sequel for a while just because I hear it has a cliffhanger. When I Hunt Killers first came out I was extremely excited to pick it up, yet, as soon as I got a copy it sat on my shelf with all my other \u201cmust-have-it-now\u201d books and languished there. I'm so glad I finally dusted it off the old TBR and read (listened) to it.

But it\u2019s a thousand times harder when you\u2019re the son of the most infamous serial killer in history. You see, Jasper\u2019s father Billy killed 124 people in the most grotesque, evil, and inhumane manner before getting caught. And for all of those years, he\u2019s been grooming Jazz to be his prot\u00e9g\u00e9. Terrified of turning out like Dear Old Dad, even with the constant reassurances of his best friend and girlfriend, his father\u2019s voice and his own fears are ever present in his mind.\n\u201dJazz was afraid of two things in the world, and two things only. One of them was that people thought that his upbringing meant that he was cursed by nature, nurture, and the predestination to be a serial killer like his father.The second thing\u2026 was that they were right.\u201d\nAnd just when things couldn\u2019t get any worse, it appears another serial killer is haunting the tiny town of Lobo\u2019s Nod. But this might be the perfect chance for Jazz to either prove that he\u2019s nothing like his father\u2026 or prove that he\u2019s just like him.How do I love this book series? Let me count the ways. I have yet to come across a YA mystery/thriller series that packs as much punch as this series does. And for all the right reasons. The characters are some of the best written, fully fleshed out protagonists I\u2019ve come across, the writing has some of the sassiest and sarcastic dialogue I\u2019ve read, and the mystery aspect of this book will keep you up well into the night, keeping an eye out to see if Billy Dent is coming for you.All of the characters in this series are so beautifully well-written. Jazz isn\u2019t your typical teenage kid, but who can blame him? With a serial killer for a father, a senile, mentally insane grandmother and a mom he has fleeting memories of, I expected him to be a whole lot more messed up than what he was. Continuously tortured by the memories of his fucked up childhood and shunned by almost the entire town, underneath his tough guy exterior is the same sad, lost boy who has nothing to lose but nothing to gain at the same time. \n\u201d\u2019What was I supposed to do?\u2019 Jazz wanted to ask the whole world. \u2018Was I supposed to kill him in his sleep? That would have been the only way to stop him. Kill my own father?\u2019Maybe that\u2019s what the world had wanted, though.\u201d\nThe effect of a childhood raised by Billy is profoundly seen in both Jazz\u2019s actions and rapport with the people around him. He knows exactly which buttons to push and can read people like magnifying glass, preying on their weaknesses and playing to their strengths. One could be tempted to describe him as a morally gray character, but Lyga manages to balance his good side with the side that has the potential to become like his father. You\u2019ll be rooting for Jazz every single moment of this book. Jazz also happens to have the best support system on the face of the planet, and you\u2019ll love them just as much as he does. Connie is Jazz\u2019s girlfriend, and let me just say right now that she\u2019s the best YA girlfriend I\u2019ve encountered. She\u2019s more than just a side piece chirpily cheering him along, staying in the background. Hell no. She\u2019s fully involved in every aspect of his life, from continuously reminding him that he is indeed a good person to calling him out on his bullshit. Yes, you read that right. Connie is not the type of girlfriend to let her man walk all over her and use her.\n\u201d\u2019I\u2019m so sick of this. So sick of this constant pity party you throw for yourself. I love you, you moron. I try to be understanding and supportive, but you keep acting like I don\u2019t get you. And you keep trying to scare me and push me away.\u201d\nAnd you know how much of a badass she is? She\u2019s such a badass that Jazz actually listens to her. I never thought I would live to see the day where a white, male YA author writes a YA relationship better than some female authors. I didn\u2019t think it was even possible, but MIRACLES HAPPEN. But my favorite character by far in this book (other than Jazz, of course), is Howie. Howie and Jazz have been best friends since grade school, but it\u2019s an unconventional friendship to say the least. I mean, when you\u2019re dad is as infamous as he is, that\u2019s unconventional in of itself. But when you\u2019re the son of a serial killer and your best friend is a Type A hemophiliac who bleeds if someone looks at him the wrong way; now that\u2019s what I call unconventional. And yet despite this, Jazz and Howie are the best of friends through thick and thin.\n\u201dHowie had been there all along, always a friend. He was Jazz\u2019s friend when Billy was still home, pretending to be just another single dad juggling his child with his job. And Howie was there when Billy got arrested, and in the shocking days right after the arrest. Most important of all, Howie remained his friend in the dark days afterward.\u201d\nAnd because of this, we are treated to some of the sassiest, most sarcastic and glorious dialogue I have had the pleasure of reading. This whole review space could probably consist of me just quoting every time Howie opens his mouth, but here are some of the best lines in the book that are just too good not to read.\n\u201d'I can't believe you told her. Whatever happened to bros before hoes?''There's a little-known corollary to bros before hos, which states that if Bro One is terrified because Bro Two's girlfriend can make his nose bleed just by looking at him the wrong way, he's allowed to put hos before bros. I chose to implement that corollary because your girlfriend is a total badass.'\u201d\n\n\u201d\u2019What\u2019s your middle name?\u2019\u2018Why do you want to know?\u2019\u2018Serial killers all have three names. I\u2019m checking to see what yours is like.\u2019\u2018Fine. Francis. It\u2019s Francis.\u2019\u2018Jasper Francis Dent. Jasper Francis Dent. Jasper Francis Dent. Nah, it doesn\u2019t work. Doesn\u2019t sound right. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re a serial killer.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201d\u2019Are you gonna have a scar?\u2019\u2018A little one. I wanted a nice big one, but no one asked me, on account of me being unconscious at the time. Can you believe it?\u201d\nHowie is easily the most hilarious character of the book, but his friendship with Jasper is so genuine and heartfelt that you\u2019ll want to be friends right there alongside them.And then there\u2019s Billy Dent. He only makes a flesh and blood appearance once, and it\u2019s toward the end. However, his voice is ever present in Jazz\u2019s head, and it\u2019s goddamn creepy. So once you actually get to the part where Jazz confronts his father in prison, it\u2019s absolutely terrifying. Lyga could have easily gone the stereotypical serial killer root, but he chillingly makes Billy equal parts charming seducer and loving father with a whole bottle full of blood and gore.\n\u201dTo his son, he had been a god. A war god, a god of love, the two of them intertwined in a sick hybrid. Billy Dent excelled at alternating brute force with tender love, then blending the two together until Jazz thought that being forced to mop up blood spatter was just a natural way to show love to his dad.\u201d\nThis is one father/son pairing that you wish will never have happened.As far as the mystery is concerned, it was absolutely genius. I won\u2019t give anything away, but I will say that they are one sick bastard. How on earth Lyga managed to cook up such deliriously crazy characters I will never know (better yet, don\u2019t want to know). It kept me on my toes and compelled my fingers to keep turning the pages well past when I should have. I never guessed who it was until the final reveal, and I wasn\u2019t disappointed. YA mysteries face a bit of a conundrum when it comes to writing them. I think the publishing industry/authors feel that they have to tone down the gore/violence/language because of the age range targeted (and probably also to keep the parents happy so their book doesn\u2019t get banned). But Barry Lyga says a big giant \u201cFuck you\u201d to that notion with this book series. It\u2019s violent, it\u2019s gory, it\u2019s real, and it\u2019s the best YA mystery series out there. It\u2019s sick, twisted, and gloriously demented. The characters are likable but all too human, and their struggles and triumphs will have you rooting harder for a bunch of teenagers than you would have thought. And it will have you wondering, come book two and three, whether or not Jazz will take the bait and become the one thing he doesn't want to.But do yourself a favor in the meantime and read this book for a spell... if you dare."}, {"userName": "Annika", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39023148-annika", "userReview": "First of all, let me say this:Though it is shelved as such, I Hunt Killers is not a Young Adult novel. The book implies rape and contains graphic violence and brutal murders. Definitely not suited for anyone under the age of 16.___________________Now that that's settled...I have a love/hate relationship with thrillers. On the one hand, I love the suspense, the guessing, the adrenaline. On the other hand... I hate the suspense, the guessing, the adrenaline. I don't deal well with not knowing what's going on. I don't like being left in the dark, and seem to fight a constant battle against myself while reading to not skip to the last chapter and just find out who the culprit is already. It's exhausting, really. But, then again, it's also exhilarating.Like I said. Love/hate.This was one of those stories that just gripped me and didn't let go of me again. I Hunt Killers is a brilliantly woven psychological thriller with a unique approach to crime investigation. 124 - that's the number of people Billy Dent had brutally murdered, many of them in front of his little son's very eyes, before he was captured and convicted 4 years ago; but not before teaching him everything he knew about killing. \nJazz knew killers. Billy had studied the serial killers of the past the way painters study the Renaissance masters. He learned from their mistakes. He obsessed over them. And he passed his knowledge down to his son. Lucky Jazz\u2014those were the things he remembered from his childhood.\nNow, at the age of 17, Jazz is one messed up kid. Seemingly normal and even charming on the outside, he constantly struggles against the not so normal urges inside of him. Jazz doesn't want to be evil, doesn't want to follow in his sociopathic father's footsteps and pick up where he left off, but it's getting harder to resist every day.\n\u201cSomeday,\u201d he murmured. \u201cSomeday I could snap. I\u2019m my father\u2019s son. It could happen. And when that day comes, when I take my first victim\u2026it could even be you.\u201d\nWhen dead bodies start piling up in his town, showing a disconcerting resemblance to his father's victims, Jazz gets the chance to prove to himself and the people around him that he is more than just a killer's son. He can hide and pretend the killing spree has nothing to to with him, or he can make use of his knowledge in order to help the police catch the copycat.I loved being in Jazz's head. It was equally disturbing and fascinating to follow his complex thought process. His ability to easily read and manipulate people (courtesy of his dad's schooling), to work his way into the killer's mind and try to figure out his motives, while simultaneously battling against his own demons was such an intriguing thing to witness. I just couldn't help liking Jazz.\nJazz had an advantage the average teen could never have: a sociopath\u2019s ability to fake absolutely any emotion with utterly convincing authority.\nThe way the author managed to scotch any suspicions I might have developed towards some of the characters by simply letting Jazz analyze everybody, well.. it was frustrating, to say the least. And that made the story all the more appealing.\nPeople matter. People are real. People matter. He couldn\u2019t convince himself.\nAn intelligent plot, an alluring protagonist, a terrifying villain and an array of fantastically developed supporting characters.Exactly what I needed and what I was looking for in this book. 5 stars!"}, {"userName": "Mlpmom (Book Reviewer)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3829694-mlpmom-book-reviewer", "userReview": "There are few YA books not only told in the point of view of a boy, but a boy like Jasper Dent, who's father was a notorious serial killer and since birth, was raised to be one as well.

It's also a reminder of what GOOD YA fiction used to be like (with some notable exceptions) until it got dumbed-down by authors and/or publishers who seem to operate under the (mistaken) assumption that teens need to be talked down to and the stories need to be more simplistic. This is a YA novel with teeth, in turns psychologically creepy with well-placed moments of humor and humanity. Barry Lyga crafted the ultimate outsider, the son of a serial killer, and gives him a sympathy all the while prickling us deep down wondering what makes a young man like him tick (or perhaps be a ticking time bomb). Lyga also gets big kudos for diversity. The main character Jazz has a black girlfriend named Connie who is no weak-willed pushover and his friend Howie suffers from hemophilia but is found in the thick of the action with a well-placed quip. In their own ways they too are outsiders.Okay, serial killers are SO not my thing. Sure, I might watch the occasional Discovery ID show when bored, but I'm not into stuff like CSI or Criminal Minds. Silence of the Lambs freaked me out for a month, and the original Psycho had me so terrified as a child that I made my mom stay in the bathroom with me while I showered (I also made my folks hide all the knives). That being said, I Hunt Killers is less about a serial killer and more about the son of one. Jasper (Jazz) Dent is a typical, good-looking teenage boy who just so happens to be the son of the most notorious serial killer in America. Talk about NOT winning father of the year awards. Jazz's childhood, if one can call it that, easily makes Mommy Dearest look like The Brady Bunch with The Waltons thrown in. Given what for all intents and purposes could be considered PTSD, Jazz struggles inside to not be a self-fulfilling prophecy. He strives for normalcy, but normalcy isn't for him, especially with a grandmother suffering from dementia whom in her lucid moments tortures Jazz mentally.That struggle to hold onto humanity is put to the ultimate test when a body is discovered outside of the town Jazz lives in. While law enforcement, a small police force headed by the man who brought Jazz's father to justice and saw the worst the man was capable of, doesn't notice anything too particular, Jazz knows in his gut that another serial killer is on the hunt. All the while Jazz questions his desire to find the killer as he has to think like one. Like his father.I just finished this and all I can really say is read this now! The writing isn't graphic or gory, but being inside the mind of brilliant and horrific madness is a journey you won't soon forget. Jazz Dent is an incredible and incredibly complex hero. I loved him, feared him and wanted to strangle him at varying points in the book. Connie is Jazz's anchor with a force of will that he needs. She sees beyond his supposedly \"dark\" reputation to the wounded soul inside. By the way, no race-fail here. Connie is smart, loyal and has a mind of her own. Howie is no action hero, but he doesn't allow his disease get in the way of being there for his best friend (and tattoo canvas). Barry Lyga crafted a tour de force mystery/thriller that will haunt you until the very last.But it's far from over...hence the title."}, {"userName": "Spider the Doof Warrior", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2348494-spider-the-doof-warrior", "userReview": "This book is full of great characters.

He's trying to turn Jazz into a copy of him. A serial killer like him. Jazz struggles with his messed up childhood and trying to resolve all of these issues. He doesn't want to follow in his father's footsteps. He'd rather prevent murder than be a murderer.This book is a YA version of Dexter in a way, but it's still gritty and actually much better than Dexter which peaked at season 4.

The tone, too, was exactly what I wanted. It's darkly humorous at times, and other times just plain dark, but it's prevented from being completely bleak by the human connections in Jazz's life. \u00a0It's through them that you know Jazz isn't a lost-cause, because they see the humanity in Jazz that he's tortured himself into pretending doesn't exist. \u00a0Through them, you know he has the potential to be loving, to be a good person, and you see the burdens he places on himself - and all the while, that good portion of his life is being constantly undermined by Jazz's impressions of himself and his fear that any good he does, any love he feels, is just an act. \u00a0The blind his inner serial killer hides behind. \u00a0It's fascinating.And interlaced with all of this, there are snippets of things Jazz saw or did with his father, as well as snippets of narration from the current Lobo's Nod serial killer, which help escalate the tension and show what Jazz really is up against and why he's so haunted. The way these scenes from his past creep up on him and never let him have peace were a really nice layer to the story. \u00a0All of it - the killer's obsession and plotting, Jazz's understanding of the horrors and his own calculation, his grandmother's craziness and his father's sociopathic glee - all of that\u00a0combines to make it a really gripping read. \u00a0And though it's gruesome, it's never gratuitous. \u00a0Lyga eschews continual bloodbaths and cheap startles in favor of a layered psychological thriller that is far more chilling as a result."}, {"userName": "Mimi Valentine", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6110599-mimi-valentine", "userReview": "Rating: 4.5 out of 5 starsIt's hard to imagine how a serial killer's mind works. But Barry Lyga must have some sort of shady part time job or at least serial killer mind-reading powers, because this book is BRILLIANT.Jazz \u2014 son of the most notorious serial killer, snarky teenager, and overall charmer \u2014 takes the phrase dark hero to extremes! Being brought up by his psychotic father, he has How To Be A Good Serial Killer lessons ingrained on his brain. Sometimes they help him figure out other cases, and sometimes they make him seem more twisted than he is. But his dark assessments are what make him so uniquely awesome, and loving Jazz is guaranteed! \u2665The rest of the cast is a riot too! Jazz's best friend Howie is a type-A hemophiliac and a quirky chatterbomb, which makes him the perfect sidekick to Jazz's dark-minded hero. His girlfriend Connie is a complete badass. And we can't forget Gramma Dent, whose hilarious incoherent ramblings prove that maybe being out-of-whack runs in the family.I Hunt Killers is dark. There are mentions of bodies being nailed to ceilings and eyeballs being fed to cats. But it's also surprisingly funny, with witty lines that catch you off guard. I didn't expect to be that enamoured by this book, but the serial killer logistics and chilling details had me reading into the early hours of the morning!Part compelling murder mystery, part intense psychological thriller, and 100 % brilliantly original story, I Hunt Killers is a deliciously dark novel that I would recommend to people of all sanity levels! Jasper Dent, I can't wait to learn more about you in book two! ;)BUY or BORROW?: Not only is the cover under the dust jacket bloodily gorgeous, but the story is SO wow-worthy!

My library holds are coming in and there is a definite theme developing! First it was In Cold Blood, now there\u2019s this young adult novel I Hunt Killers.Teenager Jasper Dent (known to his friends as Jazz) was raised by notorious serial killer Billy Dent, who did his best to make his son into Satan\u2019s little helper. Billy is in jail at this point and Jazz is living with his bat-shit-crazy grandmother, trying to keep Social Services at bay, and trying to figure out how much of his father\u2019s criminality he is responsible for. When a corpse appears in Jazz\u2019s small town, he is convinced that there is another serial killer on the loose, but the cops aren\u2019t willing to listen to a teenager, even if he is a serial killer\u2019s son. Although there is a reasonably good little mystery written into this work, the main thrust of it is a matter of responsibility. How much are parents responsible for how their children turn out? Are children responsible for their parents\u2019 actions? Nature vs. nurture. How do you know what your true nature is when you\u2019ve been trained in a certain way?I was reminded of Dan Wells\u2019 John Cleaver series (which begins with I Am Not a Serial Killer), but I prefer Lyga\u2019s version because it doesn\u2019t go paranormal on me.
