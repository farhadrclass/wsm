Unfortunately, we don\u2019t get a new Salander, but we do get a pretty interesting and flawed character in Carl Morck. Morck is a Danish police detective who survived being shot in the head during an attack that left another detective dead and one paralyzed. While Morck has returned to duty, he\u2019s so depressed and wracked by survivor\u2019s guilt that he\u2019s barely lifting a finger on his cases, and his grumpiness has alienated the other cops. His boss decides to take a sour old shot-in-the-head lemon and make lemonade out of him when national politics force him to create a department to work on high profile cold cases. Morck is \u2018promoted\u2019 to be in charge of the new Department Q and sent down to a basement office.At first, Morck is happy to be left alone in the basement where he can smoke all he wants and play computer solitaire all day, but when he learns that the department is using the money allotted for Department Q to beef up the homicide division, he demands a piece of the action including a department car, getting the basement fixed up and his own assistant to make the coffee and do the shit work. However, he gets more than just someone to answer the phone with Assad, a Syrian immigrant who is curious about the case files. When the political pressure to show some progress mounts, Morck reluctantly ends up looking into the mysterious disappearance of a beautiful female politician, Merete Lynggaard, who vanished five years before. In a parallel story, we learn what happened to Merete and her horrible fate.There was a lot I found intriguing about this book. The Morck character and the set-up of him being exiled to Department Q was an interesting idea, and I really liked this grumpy guilt-ridden detective with a messy personal life. I also loved the dynamic between him and Assad with the bright and curious assistant messing up Morck\u2019s plans to sit quietly in the basement and smoke some cigarettes. Assad can read a case file and come up with legitimate deductions and questions, but while he\u2019s smart enough to track down a long missing piece of critical evidence, he doesn\u2019t know any better than to handle it once he finds it. Unfortunately, Morck\u2019s messy personal life seemed to be a bit much after a while. He keeps getting phone calls and giving money to his estranged wife and after a while you just want to scream at him to get a divorce lawyer and change his number. While the circumstances of Merete\u2019s abduction and her circumstances are disturbing and horrible, I figured out the villain\u2019s motive early in the book so that was pretty obvious. Plus, after a while Merete\u2019s predicament starts to go over the top and takes a turn onto Torture Porn Avenue and that\u2019s not a neighborhood I like visiting.Still, despite some clunky writing (which could be a translation issue), I liked Morck and Assad, and I found the basic premise intriguing. I\u2019ve also got a big streak of Danish heritage, but know almost nothing about Denmark so it was fun to soak up a little of the old home country in a better than average crime thriller."}, {"userName": "Jeffrey Keeten", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3427339-jeffrey-keeten", "userReview": "\u201dShe\u2019d been lying on the floor thinking about books. That was something she often did in order not to think about the life she might have had if only she\u2019d made different choices. When she thought about books, she could move into a whole different world. Just remembering the feeling of the dry surface and inexplicable roughness of the paper could ignite a blaze of yearning inside of her. The scent of evaporated cellulose and printer\u2019s ink. Thousands of times now she\u2019d sent her thoughts into her imaginary library and selected the only book in the world that she knew she could recall without embellishing it...A philosophical little bear named Winnie the Pooh was her salvation. her only defense against madness. Pooh and all the animals in Hundred Acre Wood.\nMerete could have used a Pooh and a balloonMerete Lynggaard disappears in 2002. She is a well known political figure and because she is beautiful she is also photographed extensively by a roving band of paparazzi. They get paid more when it is chilly and her nipples are noticeable through her blouse. (This is a voyeuresque world.) Despite her very public professional life she keeps her private life...private. She doesn\u2019t date even though there are legions of men that would love to spend time with her. She has more important duties such as getting home to her brother who is afflicted with brain damage suffered in a car accident that also took the lives of their parents. She has enemies as do all politicians, but would any of them try to hurt her?The book flashes between 2002 and 2007. In 2007 we meet Detective Carl Morck a grumpy, depressed, at time acerbic man who no one wants to work with. When the government insists the Copenhagen police department form a cold case department the Chief of Detectives jumps at the chance to assign Carl to that department which also happens to be in the basement...way...way...away from the rest of the detectives.  In Department Q\nCarl is the darkest, dankest corner of the basement of the police department.Jussi Adler-Olsen explores the politics inherent in any organization as the Chief tries to keep as much of that government money allocated to Department Q in a slush fund and Carl Morck starts to understand that he has leverage to certainly obtain more than what they first gave him for his department. In one of his negotiations with the Chief he gets an assistant, a Syrian, with a dubious passport who is supposed to help clean Department Q, but once Carl discovers how resourceful Assad is he starts to use him to help track down clues and also obtain what he needs from other departments. Assad gets along with people much better than Carl. Now Carl does have some legitimate issues that can account for some of his anti-social behavior. He has recently returned to work from being shot. He and two other detectives were investigating a murder. They did not clear the murder scene the way we are used to seeing it done on American TV. It turns out the killer is still there and in a blaze of gunfire all three detectives are shot. One dead, one paralyzed from the neck down, and Carl with a grazed head. Things happened so fast that Carl didn\u2019t even have a chance to pull his weapon. When he replays what happened frame by frame in his head he realizes he did have time. He froze. He is cleared, but the guilt hangs like a shroud over everything he does. Carl is lonely and when an attractive female walks across his vision he has to reel his tongue back in. He is especially attracted to married women. Adler-Olsen didn\u2019t really explore that in depth, but it does make me wonder if part of their attraction for Carl is their unattainability or maybe he is attracted to older women more likely to be married. If you listen carefully you might actually hear the thump under Carl\u2019s desk as the sexy psychiatrist Mona Ibsen walks into his office. \u201dMona Ibsen sat down across from him. The light from outside on Otto Monsteds Gade shone on the back of her neck, creating a halo around her head. the soft light revealed delicate lines on her face; her lips were sensual and a deep red. Everything about her signaled high class. Carl locked eyes with her so as not to dwell on her voluptuous breasts. Nothing in the world could make him want to break out of the state he was in.\u201dI think that state is called lust Carl. I had to put my hands over my eyes during the rest of this scene. He mucks things up so badly you\u2019d think he\u2019d never talked to a woman before in his life. \nJussi Adler-Olsen even looks like a guy who just wrote a really good book.This book is a slow burn. If you have read Scandinavian books before you will expect this. I think it was around 130 pages that the book really hooked me. The book switches between Merete before 2007 and Carl investigating her cold case in 2007. As the plot picks up momentum and we learn more and more about what has happened to Merete you will find yourself on the edge of your seat. You will find yourself, despite his best efforts, to start to like Carl. You will wonder if some woman will take pity on Carl and haul his ashes. By the end you will already be looking for volume two in the Department Q series."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "Book one in a series set in Denmark featuring Detective Inspector Carl Morck, a man who believes he has exhausted his interest in his job and just wants to sit out the remaining years to his retirement.

One of his fellow police officers was killed and the other was injured for life in a horrific and traumatic event that has scarred Morck forever after. He is about as wounded and psychologically messed up as a crime fiction protagonist can be, and that seems to be a prerequisite for such characters in the dark world of Nordic Noir.Add to this that Morck is a particularly abrasive and unlikeable person to begin with and that helps to explain Morck\u2019s surprise when he is promoted to head up a new crime unit, devoted to solving cold cases. Turns out the move was politically motivated to take advantage of some appropriated funds while also shelving a problematic detective. Not born yesterday, Carl figures out how the wind has changed and at first settles comfortably into his basement digs to wait out the next twenty odd years until retirement by playing Sudoku and napping on the clock.A new hire to his department (consisting of two people) actually wants to do some police work and so the two choose one of the dozens of cold case files and get to work. So begins Adler-Olsen\u2019s introduction of his Department Q series.A plausible and seemingly interesting enough premise, coupled with the Scandinavian crime fiction theme and this looked like it was headed in all the right directions. But Morck was more annoying than wounded, and I found myself thinking about Harry Hole or Kurt Wallander. Now those are damaged cops you can follow. Half the time, especially in the dreary sub-plot about his home life, I wanted to go Vito Corleone on his whiney ass, slap him, and tell him to ACT LIKE A MAN!Adler-Olsen used a narrative structure where he switched perspectives between Morck and the victim in a crime case and following the victim was more appealing than Morck\u2019s detective work. Until Adler-Olsen went overboard and her story turned into a weird sadistic melodrama. Still, looking back on the book, I felt closer to this storyline than with Morck\u2019s.Overall I must concede that I liked it, almost kind of grudgingly. Not one of the better Nordic Noir lineups, but Adler-Olsen is a good writer and this is a good concept for more stories."}, {"userName": "Sherry Roberts", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6602338-sherry-roberts", "userReview": "So Stieg Larson has drawn me into the world of Scandinavian sleuths.

There are so many good mysteries appearing by Scandinavian writers recently. Why are they just now being translated into English? I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve run into a better detective duo than Carl, a policeman of many years experience, and his sidekick Assad, who he supposedly hired to clean the office. Assad says he\u2019s an emigrant from Syria where he used to be a taxi driver but he seems to have skills that not many cabbies could claim. He\u2019s able to get documents examined and deciphered with the help of friends with special skills but no names. And they do it more quickly and accurately than the police department. He uses his charm to get co-worker\u2019s help and allegiance where the cantankerous Carl fails. He notices and remembers things that Carl misses. The funniest parts are when Carl underestimates Assad though it\u2019s understandable because of Assad\u2019s mad skills at coming across as a hapless charmer with a wide toothed grin. It\u2019s a perfect way for him to hide in plain sight. He\u2019s always cheerful, whistling or singing as he scrubs the office and then drops a clue that explodes the case. This book is more about the journey and less about the ending. In fact Adler-Olsen let\u2019s you in on the probable ending right as the story opens but there are many twists and turns along the way that propel you to keep turning pages.

People calling this the next \"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\" are wrong in a myriad of ways.First, the writing is just not good. The dialogue is stilted at best and, at times, completely ridiculous. I actually laughed at some of the things the characters said. And they were not supposed to be funny. I don't know how much of this is attributable to the translation, but it needs work. A lot of it.Second, the protagonist is an asshole. And not a likeable asshole. Not the kind you root for. He's a sad-sack asshole (what are you even still doing married to your wife and paying for her shit? Divorce her! DIVORCE. HER. What are you thinking, you moron?). The man is completely unrelateable and he doesn't even have the edge of brilliance to push him over into grudging respect territory. He's lazy and pretty damn slow on the the uptake (thanks for pulling his shit together, convenient sidekick!). I greeted his troubles with a resounding \"meh\". If you want to get better, make some effort. If you don't, stop whining about it. My sympathy is deep and wide, but not for you.Third, the plot twist was not a twist. Was it supposed to be? Because I guessed who the attractive guy was and who was holding Merete in about the third chapter. It was not a stretch. It was not subtle. Don't try to make this some sort of edge-of-your-seat type thing if you are going to spell out the mystery like this is some sort of elementary school mystery book. I know who did it.

Another excellent series discovered. I've heard tell of the Department Q series for some time but never got around to the books. Then my niece happened to give me a copy of the first in the series and I took advantage of a recuperation period post shoulder surgery for a dive into this new world. And it was well worth it.Carl M\u00f8rck is the head of this new department, a bit of a grudging head, since it comes on the heels of a disastrous last homicide case in which one of his close fellow officers was killed, another severely wounded and he luckily survived less severe wounds. He's back to work but unsure of himself and the world. And now he has a new charge--working on cold cases, selecting what he wants to do from a pile available to him, working alone. Well sort of alone in his basement office except for this strange fellow Assad, who is quite literally a jack of all trades.The plot here follows two threads, one following the cold case from its inception, and the second following the new investigation as well as Carl's life and attempts to work out all that has happened to him. I grew to like all of the characters quite a bit (except for an obvious few) and appreciate the author's skill at character development as well as his ability to eke out those small details of a criminal case that can make all the difference.I very definitely recommend this book to all, like myself, who haven't yet discovered it, and I plan to continue with the second book as soon as possible."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed", "userReview": "This longish Nordic thriller/mystery delivers a very satisfying read, for the most part.

The funny and personable interactions between Carl and Assad are the most interesting parts of the cop narrative. The main plot of the top Danish government official's kidnapping which they're trying to solve is serviceable enough. The suspense builds well, and the pacing is solid.

I went into it thinking it'd be just one more moody, scandinavian mystery. And it was to some extent. But it was also a suspenseful, sometimes dryly funny effort. And Carl Morck as protagonist was highly appealing.Carl is a detective with the Copenhagen police. He's returned to work after a shooting that left his partner paralyzed and another colleague dead. Where once he was a hard-charging investigator, now he is having a hard time caring about anything. What's the point? What once were minor irritations bug the crap out of him and it shows. None of his colleagues want to work with him on anything. And his boss, Marcus, is at wits end. He can't fire Carl (becaue of the union and because Carl was injured) but he doesn't want him in the squad anymore either. When the government decides to fund a nationwide cold-case investigation unit that will be based out of Copenhagen, Marcus decides to \"promote\" Carl to a new position as the head of Department Q - while managing to keep most of government appropriated funds for his homicide dept.Carl finds himself in a basement office with a stack of files he doesn't intend to touch. That intention is put aside when his new assistant, hired at Carl's insistence as someone to keep the basement office clean, shows an interest in the caseload and prods Carl into action. Assad is a Syrian with a sketchy command of the Danish language. But he also proves to be smart and capable. Soon the two men are caught up in the case of a missing elected member of the government, Merete Lynggard. Merete disappeared from a ferry five years ago and was presumed drowned somewhere between Denmark and Germany. But her body never surfaced and as Carl reluctantly investigates he realizes that much was missed in the early investigation.The author intersperces Carl's investigation with chapters that describe the captivity of an unknown woman. It's not hard to guess who she is, but guessing whether Carl will find her or not is another thing. I was feeling so tense about her fate that I was tempted to peek at the end to see how it came out. I managed to hold myself back and am happy that I did so because it made the reading that much better - whatever the outcome.Reading as Carl re-emerges as the very competent police detective he'd once been and his interactions with the very interesting Assad (which were often funny) was a delight. If I have one quibble it is that some of the supporting cast felt a little sketched in and not as believable as the stars.

Known for his 3 stand-alones (The alphabet House, The Company Basher, and Washington Decree and the famous Department Q novels his popularity in Denmark has finally migrated over to the U.S. All Department Q novels are set in Denmark and reveal the writings of an author intensely interested in criticizing politics while simultaenously being agnostic to parties in general. Not that this is any great revelation as for the most part politics is the mainstay of most European dinner table conversations. On this topic of politics, the author says:\"If you with that ask me whether I'm critical of the political system, then yes. If you ask me whether I have a tendency to defend party-political opinions, then no. My agenda political wise is firstly to criticize regardless of what is to criticize, and no matter what the basis of view is, and secondly to appeal to the politicians in power that they should understand that they are our servants and not our masters, and that they first and foremost on their fields of activity should learn to acknowledge mistakes and to evaluate their own actions.\"Through his protagonist Carl M\u00d8rck, a lone detective absconded to the basement of police headquarters, heading a cold case department of one, and for all the world a detective ostracized for his unsociable and arrogant manner we bump head-on into the political machinations of Denmark's finest if not the corruption of a government beyond. Not that corruption threatens to take over the story. The author is careful about that:It's all about having and keeping empathy. If you have this ability in your writings, it will never be the corruption in itself that is the story's starting point, but the people and the relations that the corruption affects. It is as simple as that! If you want to be a writer, you have to learn to turn everything upside down.Born a son to a father with a psychiatric degree and living on the premises of such mental institutions a portion of his life, Jussi Adler-Olsen has developed a keen insight into a human's boundlessness, self-centeredness if not the degree to which human beings can succumb to a lack of affection.If it wasn't for these issues, there wouldn't be any thriller novels in the world. And the consequences of these character flaws give me a lot to work with. Revenge, strive for justice, and insanity.As with most Nordic thrillers (Jo Nesbo, Henning Mankell, Larson, etc), there's a certain ennui that pervades the populace. Perhaps that is due to the unique form of Scandinavian democracy that today seems to be under siege by more globalistic tendencies, a slight leaning to the right that highly values the individual instead of the public society so prominent in Scandinavian countries. As with these other thriller writers, we view a somber if not morose society...practical, but not affluent in that affection mentioned by the author.We have had a very negative and sad period, but the right to criticize and reject bad ideas in their unblemished form still holds. And there is no other place on earth, in my opinion, that uses this right as frequently and thoughtfully, which I'm proud of.But what is it about  novels that is captivating readers across the globe? I can only speak for myself. As always, translations must be kept in mind and my hat's off to those who attempt to translate a foreign language into English. It is an art in and of itself. Especially when one considers that it is possible to have thoughts in one language that are not possible in another. Being bilingual myself, I still wrestle with certain idioms not available to me when communicating in English. In this sense, Lisa Hartford does an excellent job in her translation from Danish to English. Indeed, in terms of immediate and enduring attention grabbing, Adler-Olsen is in the Chandler class.As with most European and Scandinavian mystery/crime novels, the causation behind the crime is usually a simple event rationalized by an unhealthy mind. I love this about Nordic thrillers...how we are brought to fully understand motivation as part of the unravelling of a mystery. You could say that this is exactly what is wrong with Hollywood where everything is sensationalized, instead of sprung forth out of ordinary life.Junior Detective Superintendent Carl M\u00d8rck has a brilliant mind and as is usually the case, brilliance inspires envy, and envy destroys achievements. The way Jussi Adler-Olsen portrays this within the Danish police force cannot be dismissed. Ever critical, he has created a character both perfectly ordinary as well as constantly critical of everything set before him. There is a quiet humor behind the man who has no qualms about doing nothing but placing his feet on his desk and complain that he is too busy...until of course he becomes interested at which point he becomes a Danish bloodhound.The plot is exquisite, driven not by the unveiling of a carefully kept ending held close to the chest by the author (I've read reviews where some partially dismiss this author for guessing the who-dun-it half way through) but rather by the unveiling of the true motivation behind the crime which gives the reader an entirely different satisfaction. Cold cases are tough and most of them are not solved. But, as Adler-Olson says:It's all about having and keeping empathy.This review will be the same for all Department Q novels...so if you've read this one, you've read 'em all. Updates will be included in subsequent novels in this series, if warranted.Enjoy!"}, {"userName": "Krbo", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20371267-krbo", "userReview": "pitko, zanimljivo i zabavno.Jussi odli\u010dno pi\u0161e, glavni inspektor Carl ima svoj obvezni teret pro\u0161losti \u0161to ga \u010dini malo puknutim no tu je i galerija likova koji opu\u0161taju napetost po\u010dev\u0161i od vrlo neobi\u010dnog (i tajnovitog) asistena, Sirijske izbjeglice Assada (naravno, Hafez el-Assad kako bi bilo zanimljivije) to Carlovih podstanara i \u0161a\u0161ave \u017eene koja ne bi \u017eivjela s njim no ne \u017eeli ni rastavu.Zaplet (i rasplet) prvog romana serijala je OK, ni\u0161ta komplicirano no Jussi dr\u017ei konce od po\u010detka i vrlo dinami\u010dno bez ikakvih skretanja vodi radnju tako da se knjiga \u010dita vrlo brzo.Jaka trojka - skoro pa \u010detvorka i preporuka \u017eanroljupcima."}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "[Bettie's Books (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5240149-brenda", "userReview": "This was my April Book Pal's choice and it was a good one!

It was written in Danish and translated by Tiina Nunally. The translation reads very well. It seems from the inside cover that it may be the first of three, much like the Millenium series, with the second and third volumes due to appear in 2012 and 2013.Our \u2018hero\u2019 is Carl M\u00f8rck, a detective who appears to be burned out. Given that one of his colleagues was killed and another left paralysed this is understandable, since he believes he could have prevented it. On top of that he is no longer young. So we meet a detective who has stopped trying to accomplish anything and treats his fellow officers and admin staff in a brusque and abrasive manner. It seems he no longer cares.His superiors try to solve the M\u00f8rck problem by moving him sideways into a new department \u2013 Department Q \u2013 intended to deal with cold cases. He recruits an assistant to keep his office clean and sort the files while he puts his feet up and reads the paper. He is named as Hafez el Assad, which we don\u2019t believe for a minute since this is the name of the late Syrian dictator. Later on in the book M\u00f8rck himself begins to suspect that there is more to his assistant than meets the eye, but confronting him with his suspicions gets him nowhere, so M\u00f8rck and the reader are none the wiser. Some material held back for the next book?The file they end up working on, their first case, concerns a politician who disappeared from a ferry in 2002. The previous police investigation concluded that she had been lost overboard, perhaps as a result of an argument with her brother which was known to have occurred on deck. But the reader knows from the front cover that this is not correct.\u2018Her 37th birthday. The seventh year she\u2019s been imprisoned in a pressure chamber. They turn off the lights and turn up the pressure . . .\u2019 However, there is a problem here because the back cover tells us that \u2018She vanished five years ago\u2019. So, is it seven or five? Have the publishers read the book? The confused reader will find an accurate timetable on page 379 compiled by the perpetrator himself.There are two intercut timelines. One begins with the imprisonment of the politician in 2002, the other in 2007 with M\u00f8rck and Assdad\u2019s investigation. As the book progresses, the first catches up with the second till everything is in the here and now. The chapters dealing with Lynggaard in the pressure chamber must have been difficult to write, the problem being to introduce any development at all when nothing significant changes. The author manages this well and there are, in any case, fewer of these chapters.The politician is Merete Lynggaard, who seems to have led a blameless life, much of it spent looking after her brother Uffe, who had suffered brain damage in a car accident in which she had also been involved. (Although Lynggaard is a politician and the book is set in Denmark, readers should not expect the same level of political intrigue as in the Danish TV series, The Killing.)The question is who has kidnapped Lynggaard and why? Working out the why leads very quickly to the who, and in this case I figured it out before being told. If this book were simply a whodunit, this might take away most of the pleasure from reading on, however I didn\u2019t find that at all. MERCY is an engrossing read because the main characters and the environments they inhabit are well realised. And the book has something else going for it. Despite M\u00f8rck\u2019s lust for Mona Ibsen, a counsellor who tries to help him deal with his mental problems, there isn\u2019t a single description of sexual congress from first page to last.The only change I would make is dispensing with the prologue, a graphic account of the damage Merete Lynggaard inflicts on herself attempting to escape from the pressure chamber. Presumably this is intended to function as a hook, but as hooks go it lacks tempting bait.Comparing MERCY to books by other Scandinavian writers I have recently read, I am much more impressed by this author than by Camilla L\u00e4ckberg or Yrsa Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir and look forward to reading the next book in the series.There is an error on page 246: \u2018Atomos was an a little shit.\u2019"}, {"userName": "Laura von Eden", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51197670-laura-von-eden", "userReview": "Ich entdecke Reihen ja auch gerne erst sp\u00e4ter f\u00fcr mich, denn das bedeutet, dass man erstmal viel Lesestoff hat und nicht ewig auf die Folgeb\u00e4nde warten muss.

On a routine call to check out a murder, he and his team were ambushed. One was killed outright, while the other, Hardy, lives but is paralysed below the neck. Carl carries the burden of guilt, believing that he should have been more vigilant. He was also shot, but the bullets caused no serious physical injury.When he returns to the force after the ambush, he is told that he will be \"reassigned\" to a new department, Department Q. He's given an \"office\" in the basement and a quirky Arab assistant named Assad, whose behaviour disconcerts the moody Morck.They are given a stack of cold cases to investigate and the first they look into is that of Merete Lynggaard, a prominent, beautiful politican who disappeared after apparently falling off a ferry on a trip to Germany. No body was ever found, but the presumed cause of death was drowning, whether by accident or suicide is unclear.It becomes clear quite quickly that the initial investigation, headed by a lazy detective, had missed many vital pieces of information and evidence. Mr Assad is first to cotton onto inconsistencies in the file, and gradually Carl is drawn out of his apathy and into the case. He and Assad form an unlikely team, with their relationship tempered by Morck\u2019s cynicism and Assad\u2019s ethnic differences. A Syrian refugee, who claims to have been a taxi driver in Damascus, Assad displays a shrewd mind and obvious skills for detecting. He is particularly adept at extracting information from the female secretaries in the Homicide Division. As the bond grows between the two men, there is a lot of wry humour as they often wrong-foot each other. Gradually they coalesce into a functioning unit, and despite some false moves, they progress towards the inevitable closing of the cold case, with some surprising twists in the tail/tale.This is an exceptionally well written police procedural. I really enjoyed it and had difficulty putting it down. There are multiple narrative strands, but I did not find them too confusing. It was intriguing for me to try to weave strands together, sometimes quite erroneously (but, hey, being misled by the author is part of the fun in crime novels!) The world-weary, ill-humoured Morck could be criticised for being a bit too much like the Swedish role model for Scandi crime, Kurt Wallander, but I found enough difference to regard him as his own, Danish, man. There was some impressive scientific info scattered throughout the text, critical to the solving of the case, which appealed to the science nerd part of my brain. Chuck in a fractious boss, a decades-old car accident, plus a number of weird and/or unsavoury characters and you have a recipe for a successful whodunnit. For me the most engaging character was Mr Assad, who brought so much vitality and unintended humour to the story and to Morck's glum personality.5\u2605s"}, {"userName": "Nicola Mansfield", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1682713-nicola-mansfield", "userReview": "eason for Reading: The plot just screamed \"read me!\" and I'm a fan of Scandi Crime.Outstanding! The first chapter had me hooked on the case and the second chapter had me fascinated with the main character, Copenhagen detective Carl Morck. Usually I'm into the serial killer type of crimes but this case involves a kidnapping/missing persons case that is incredibly taut and gripping. Carl Morck has just come back to work after being in a shoot-out where he was injured and each of his two partners were either killed or seriously impaired for life. Carl has never been a lovable guy and this emotional event has not helped matters. He is sent to the basement, given his own department, Department Q, where he will work on cold cases. The first one that he and his Syrian assistant choose is that of the missing persons case of a prominent young female politician who has been missing, presumed accidentally drowned, five years ago. But Carl and Assad find out that many things were not properly investigated at the time. Everyone assumes that she is dead, but Merete isn't dead and won't be until her kidnapper's appointed time of execution.Carl is a flawed character with many problems but one that the reader routes for and agrees with as he fights against the establishment. His Syrian assistant, Assad, is both comic relief and a very intriguing character as he demonstrates great insight into detective work and has amazing contacts and capabilities which provoke interest in his mysterious past. Carl and Assad make a great team, their opposing characters bounce off each other as each gains great respect for the other.The case was fabulous! Everything one can want in a thriller. Full of twists and turns and fantastic descriptions of the victim's suffering. The point of view alternates between the present with Carl investigating the disappearance and with the past as we watch what happened to the victim unfold until the years meet up with the present. I must admit I guessed \"whodunit\" *very* early in the book, not from any clues, just simply because it felt like a logical surmise. This didn't spoil my reading one bit though as all the twisting and plot reveals only unfolded into an amazingly unguessable plot that put everything together in a very satisfying story for me.

Has it all, a great protagonist, horrible villains, a mystery with complex clues, a sidekick who's an immigrant with an intriguing backstory. Very contemporary, almost a thriller. Suspenseful moments, funny moments, and moments that will just make you think.Carl Morck and two of his colleagues were ambushed at a crime scene. Carl survived, but with injuries and other psychological issues. A bit disillusioned with life, and his job, and fellow detectives, he finds himself promoted - or is it demoted? - to a division set up to investigate cold cases. But Carl just wants to surf the net and smoke, biding his time until retirement.Until a fascinating case involving a career politician lands on his desk. It seems she disappeared while on a ferry, going on vacation with her severely disabled brother. (The back story of this sister and brother is a whole novel in itself.) Carl's job is to take a second look at the case, and yes he finds holes everywhere. (Suffice to say the original investigation was a slipshod, botch job.) As he maneuvers his own personal issues and learns to get along (and appreciate) his only assistant, Assad from Syria, Carl slowly, meticulously, and methodically solves the case.Now I also figured it out about two-thirds in, but I've read a zillion mysteries.
