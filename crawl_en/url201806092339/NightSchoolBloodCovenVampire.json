Yup. She did! Fairies! When I initially read these books when they came out, I'll admit I didn't like the fairies that were added. But now, as an adult who constantly sees giant film and book universes I understand the need for such an addition - and it does, oddly, work!! I think it's a cute addition, and I would like to see Mari build more into these ideas in future installments. Rayne is our lead in this book, and her sassiness is there (as always). And, as always, this book is fast paced and kept me interested. Plus, on top of it all, Mari tops her plot lines and goes a little crazier. She always seems to know how to go bigger and better.One thing I really like about these books is Mari seems to understand that it can be lengthy between the times you read her books - so she summarizes what happened last. In the first couple books it annoyed me (because I was reading them back to back) but when I realized that there is typically a wait in between and you might forget what our heroines were up to, then I was all on board! If this is something you don't like, you can always skip!! But I think this is a nice addition that'll help readers out.I did have an issue with this book - we've grown to love Jareth and Magnus so much, and they weren't in this book as much as I would like. Yes, they weren't integral to the story but it was a shame to pick up this book and not have some epic storylines with them. They were still there, but not as much as they could have been. Five out of five stars."}, {"userName": "Book Binge", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1660591-book-binge", "userReview": "This was my first Blood Coven novel (this is the fifth novel in the series) but, as the book starts with a \"My story thus far\u2026\", it's pretty easy to catch up. Blood Coven novels switch points of view between the two sisters and this time, it was Rayne's turn to tell the story. We start out with a quick recap of what's been happening in the two sisters' lives and, well, it's quite a bit. Rayne was always the Goth chick, into the arcane and paranormal while Sunny was completely the opposite. When Rayne decided she wanted to be a vamp, she took the classes, got certified and, instead of the vamp, Magnus, biting and turning Rayne, he bit Sunny. Sunny was pissed and so she went off to get un-vamped by way of the Holy Grail. Along the way, Sunny and Magnus fell in love, though Sunny still reversed the transformation and went back to being a normal human. Rayne, on the other hand, did eventually get turned but only after she found out she was a vampire slayer. So now, she's a vampire/vampire slayer. With a vampire for a boyfriend.Now the girls have just found out that their parents are both fairies\u2014royal ones\u2014which makes Rayne a vampire/vampire slayer/fairy princess. Sunny's just a fairy princess but, turns out, the fairies want her to be their queen and they're willing to kidnap her to do it. So, Sunny and Rayne are shipped off to this remote vamp slayer school for their own protection. Once there, Rayne realizes she has no blood and no way to get it (despite some rather obvious hints from someone on campus). Crazed with bloodlust after an attack by the fairies (how did they find the girls?), Rayne entrances and bites Corbin, one of the Alphas (supposedly the best slayers the school has to offer). Then she figures out her sister actually was kidnapped and they left a changeling in her place so they all have to escape the school, get to Fairyland, and save Sunny. (Oh, and there are also really bad things going on in this building on campus, nicknamed \"Night School\", but we'll just leave that for another book, shall we?)Maybe I've drunk my fill of vampires (pun intended) but I just wasn't a fan of NIGHT SCHOOL. Don't get me wrong\u2014the writing is fast-paced and the action never stops but, for once, I wanted it to stop just so I could catch my breath. I mean, we jump from a kidnapping attempt to a creepy new school to a confrontation with the Alphas to Rayne becoming a fairy for real-zies (the girls weren't \"official\" fairies until they did an incantation) to another kidnapping attempt to near-death and on and on. It was just too much.Plus, it just wasn't realistic. Okay, I realize \"realistic\" is maybe the wrong word, since fairies and vampires and the like don't really exist. But to have one character be a vampire slayer AND a vampire AND a fairy princess AND to have a vampire boyfriend AND a (sort of) vampire slayer boyfriend? It was too much for me.Then there's Corbin, the new guy in Rayne's life. He's a jerk. An asshat. An arrogant douche who also happens to hate vampires since one killed his parents, which makes him exceedingly dangerous for her (a vamp) to be around. But he's just so cute! And, of course, Rayne's drawn to him and sucks his blood, which makes him think he's in love with her. Gah! Please give this girl some common sense. Plus, doesn't she already have a boyfriend who she claims to love? Come on, Rayne. Get it together.I know this series is loved by many and, maybe if I'd started with the first one and worked my way through them, I would have liked this one. Become a convert to the Blood Coven, even. But, to me, this book wasn't cute or quirky, as it was written to be; it was a long slog through an outlandish story.Rating: 2.0/5.0This review was originally posted on Book Binge by Mary."}, {"userName": "Loni Flowers", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4343799-loni-flowers", "userReview": "My thoughts: Just when you think nothing worse could possibly happen to Sunny and Rayne\u2026it does! Now they find out shocking news that their parents have a past and they use to live in Fairyland and their mom was Queen of the Fairies. The only problem, Fairyland needs a new queen and if mom won't do it, one of the twins has to. But when there is an attack on the family which endangers their lives, mom and dad go back to Fairyland to sort things out and the twins are hidden away in the Swiss Alps at Riverdale Academy, a secret vampire slayer training facility. When Sunny starts acting out of character, Rayne gets suspicious that something sneaking is going on a Riverdale. However this could be the one place that might be the death of Rayne because she's a vampire among a school full of slayers. Will she be able to keep her secret safe or get \"dusted\" in the process?As with all the other books in this series, it was a fun read and I found myself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. Rayne never fails on making smart remarks or finding the humor in a situation she may be stuck in. I love her character. She's her own person and doesn't care what others think about her. She's protective over her sister Sunshine and doesn't back down from a challenge. Rayne faces a lot of challenges this go round. There is a ton of action in this book and the journey that Rayne and Sunshine take leave me curious as to what book 6- Blood Ties will be about. I'd have to say that I enjoyed this book the most out of the series so far. It turned into quite a page turner. If you are a fan of this series then of course you should pick this book up on Jan 4th, 2011. It's a great compliment to the previous 4 books."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1630945-alex", "userReview": "[ 1. We find out at the beginning of this book that Rayne and Sunny's mom and dad were fairies that ran away from Fairyland so they could be together. The baby that their dad had with Heather while still married to their mom? Totally normal in fairy world, and their mom didn't care at all. In fact, their mom LOVES Heather and was totally supportive of them being together. Here is where my problem lies. For YEARS, their mom has participated in saying that their father was a deadbeat dad, that Heather was a Home Wrecking Bitch (their words), and worse. When in reality, their mom loves Heather and thinks very highly of her, and their dad is staying away for their protection. I can understand the need to protect them, but how can their mom let these two girls cry all the time about their father not loving them and leaving them all for Heather? Couldn't she have lied to them and said that she wanted the divorce and he moved on with Heather, or something? I just don't understand how a mother could inflict that pain on her daughters and JOIN IN on bashing people that she holds in high regard. It didn't sit right with me at all.2. Their dad dies at the end.  I  almost cry, but the twins show hardly any emotion. It hints that their mom was falling in love with their dad again, but within minutes of him dying, she is back with David and shows no remorse at her fallen lover. Huh? 3. Fairyland is Disney World. Yes, you read that right. 4. Their mom - who is a fairy princess, mind you - freaks out when she finds out that Sunny and Rayne's boyfriends are vampires. She is so upset by it, that Rayne has to hide that she, too, is a vampire. Seriously? Could you be any more of a hypocrite?5. The twin's boyfriends seriously suck. (No pun intended) Magnus was completely ruined for me practically from the get-go, but Rayne has nothing to say about Jareth except how gorgeous he is. She had more chemistry with this new prep kid, as well as a booming genuine friendship with him. Same with Sunny and Jayden (?) from the last book. How I wanted her to dump Magnus and get with Jayden, but alas - he is so gorgeous she never will. Ugh.6. Oh yeah, and the twins find out that the grandmother who has been there for them their entire childhood was an actor hired to play the role of a loving grandmother. Seriously? I don't give a crap how much you are wanting to protect your children. This goes back to point 1 - you gave them a fake childhood with fake family, and then let them believe the worst of their father to the point that they don't even care when he died. Oh, and he died to SAVE RAYNE. But as long as she is with her gorgeous boyfriend who cares, right?7. I liked Rayne at first, but these endless and stupid mistakes she keeps making are driving me insane. She kisses her elbow to become a fairy and then just says \"whoops?\" Ugh.

I'm partly glad I read this, so I'm caught up with the series, but I also think I didn't need to read it. I felt that this installment wasn't the best out of the rest of the series. The plot was kind of made up on the spot. I could understand why Rayne should go to Riverdale, but it was weird how Sunny had to go to. Sunny isn't a vampire slayer, so why couldn't she just go to another private school or a public school in a foreign country? It seemed unnecessary for them to go to a school to go into hiding. Along with that, the romance between Corbin and Rayne was confusing. It seemed like they both had feelings for each other, but then Rayne mentions that it is because of feeding off of him. So, I wasn't sure whether or not Corbin feelings were true and why did she like him if she knew the reason to his behavior? Plus, I have to mention the fae names and world. It was cliche and I wish it was a little more mythical and not Disney-ish. Characters: Rayne - She was the narrator for this installment. I do like her POV's because it's a little less slang oriented. However, her's has less romance in it this time around. She would mention Jared and Corbin, but it wasn't a priority for her, which made me doubt how strongly she felt for Jared. She said she loves him but it's hard to see when they're together. But, I do love how determined she is and that she thinks logically to get out of situations. Sunny - When one twin is narrating, it seems like they're distant from the other twin, but yet they say they're close. Rayne doesn't have a clue what's going on with Sunny and I didn't like Sunny a lot of times in here. She was whiny or confused; it was hard to find her likable. Cover: The girl is perfect for Rayne. It has her blue eyes and dark hair. It's very simple, but pretty. I love the new covers for this series. Overall Rating: I have to give this book a two out of four. I didn't like this installment and couldn't get into it. I'm hoping that the seventh one will involve more romance and drama like they usually do. This one wasn't the best and since I read Blood Ties and then read this, I didn't really need to read this. I do love this series and will continue, but I wasn't happy this book at all.

The premise- 2 twins who are both vampires (and in one case, a slayer) find out they're OMG! fairy princesses! (WTF!?!)And no- that's not me being glib with the chat-speak, that's REALLY how the author writes. Which is nauseatingly immature, and will date the series/book in about 5 minutes.Not to mention, I can't figure out how someone so stupid as the narrator (Rayne) has managed to NOT get herself killed. She makes Sailor Moon look like a brainiac. (Even Betsy Taylor from \"Undead and Unwed\" had more to offer the world.) How someone with a journalism degree can write such insulting, mindless drek about modern teenagers is beyond me. I'm used to misunderstandings and adults not being smart as the main cause of conflict in teen romance & adventure... but this presumes everyone involved (in supposed age-old secret societies of otherworldly creatures) could be outwitted by four year olds.

next thing rayne knew, the last thing she remembered was that her mother was on the floor in pain trying to protect rayne and then nothing.rayne wakes up at a slay school and heather says that they probaly going to stay there for a while. and later on sunny is all crying about her love life and how magnus might think she ran away from him for jayden(the guy that sunny meant in vegas on her mission to save magnus).they then meet lilli-happy type of chick.later on after talking to the headmaster, the twins run into the \"alphas\" as everyone calls them-tuff bullies/school sucks/ i slayed vampires and noone else slayed as much as me kind of people-5 people to the alpha group.luckily sunny was there to calm rayne or she was going to beat their asses

doesnt think it works until next day rayne ends up seeing her own wings, along with sunny freaking out.now sunny knows that rayne is hungry for blood, and she is starting to have wings...and that they have to run away from the school to be safe.they run later on only to be caught in some trap and found out the alphas took them. and they were talking with the alphas and hanging around when rayne asked corbin what side is he on(like werewolf,vampire..). and then rayne finds later on from the other members that vampires killed corbins parents and that cobin wants to become a slayer to take revenge on the creatures...later on cobin comes running and saying that things are coming, and fairys ends up coming and rayne gets hurt saving cobin,cobin then ends up carrying rayne to a cave. and later he comes to report about sunny and that shes safe and also that the alpha kicked their asses....rayne found out that he never acturally killed a vampire before, it was just in a game that he killed vampires..rayne later on ends up using the vampire scent on corbin and sucks his blood to heal herself,after that cobin wakes up later on and rayne says that he got \"bitten\" by a fairy,then he fainted again.next day peter ends up being cassies partner in slay class because corbin was still in the infirmary.rayne ends up sending peter sailing across the field with one little touch.peter leaves later on asking to go to the infirmiary, while rayne thought and thought...until she found out that maybe she has vampire powers now because she finally bit a human..and now she has a plan to escape using her powers and she needs to find sunny.only to find her in the cafateria laughing like nothing ever happened and saying that peters cute and all that.cobin ends up coming in the cafateria and taking rayne with him out to the forest.only to have corbin tell his story about his parents being sucked by a vampire and dieing, and rayne ends up drinking cobins blood again.sunny meets rayne in the dorm later on at around 5 am and she said that she had *** with this random dude named aiden... so much for sunnys\"special\" first time with magnus plan.then later on everyone is ordered to go to the chruch, where the headmaster tells everyone that their in lockdown and that the DNA that they tested was a DNA of a vampire and a fairy..also that they will be interviewing each of the students.later on corbin feels raynes wings while hugging her and he knows that shes the one who sucked his blood and walks away.then rayne gets sunny and puts her in a closet, only to find out later on that the person inside sunny isnt really sunny, and that the person inside sunny told the headmaster that rayne is a vampire and a fairy...rayne wakes up in a room later on, and the headmaster tells rayne the truth about the night house, and how they pick a few kids and test DNAs on them...and now corbin is in a bed next to rayne, and people are planning to test raynes DNA with corbin...to see if he will become someone really strong...and later on rayne wakes up to be trapped in chains and corbin is too, later on rayne calls for help and later on lilli shows up-and shes a vampire!-thats why she heard raynes call,....,....,and her names not really lilli-its rachel-and in place of her happy outfit is a goth outfit!so they were about to go out when rayne steps on a place and alarms start to go...rachel ends up dieing saving corbin and raynes lifes...and rayne and corbin escaped on a helicopter..later they arrive at a place, and jareth comes running in with a happy expression on his face for seeing her alive.later on magnus,corbin,rayne,and jareth ends up on a airplane,where their heading off to a city close to fairy,where they plan to find fairy and save sunny...later on

up sucking almost all his blood from him. then jareth turned him into a vampire later on, then metioning to rayne that magnus has to know what happened and rayne has to do what magnus says.later on magnus is mad when he finds out what happened and wants to put rayne in a help program for vampires, but for now he allows to let rayne save sunny first, later on their at the entrance of fairy,but no vampires could come in because it was sunny, so rayna and jareth went..later on they catch sunny on a cart being pulled by horses, but when sunny sees rayne, she doesnt notice her.rayne trys to get to sunny when tinker(yes, tinker bell) beated up rayne and the world went dark.rayne wakes up to find jareth across the other cell from her, and her parents in another!her mom later finds out that rayne is dating a vampire and also sunny and is freaking out.magnus comes later on(9he has a GPS on jareth) and frees them, and convinces raynes mom to be on their side.after that their under the tower when apple blossom(the guy that the twins mom was supose to marry but picked to run away with their dad instead) came and almost killed rayne, but raynes dad grabbed a iron thingy and stabed it to the fairys chest and he fell..then the dad fell too..and rayne then remembered that fairys are allergic to iron, and that her dad risked his life for her..rayne remembers his last words befor he died\"Don\u2019t let this all be in vain.\".later on sunny is about to get married when magnus runs in and declines their marrage and says that he owns sunny, that made the priest say that if sunny says magnus owns her, then they can leave in peace. only to have sunny still under a spell and doesnt even know magnus..but later on magnus kissed sunny and freed her from the spell-just like any disney movie.and so at the end the twins mom ends up saying that she wants to stay in fairy since its her destiny, and that heather will take care of the twins till their 18....EPILOGUE:  Problem:corbin is now a vampire, and he doesnt appreciate the blood coven for saving his life, and wants revenge on the blood coven and rayne...so he hacked into magnus safe place and stole some of magnus's important documents...and now everyone knows that war is coming once corbin gives the important papers to the slayer inc."}, {"userName": "Brina", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2011", "userURL":

Man lernt Sunshine und Rayne noch besser kennen und mag sich beim Schlie\u00dfen des Buches gar nicht von ihnen trennen.Aber auch die Eltern werden in diesem Buch besonders hervorgehoben.

This book made me both sad and mad. Strong emotions, you must think. And indeed they are, but not for the right reasons. I was so excited to read this book and was so disappointed in it when I finished. I had to check to make sure I had the right book, by the right author. It was soooo ridiculous I could not believe it.This book starts where the last one left off. Sunny and Rayne find out that they are fairies and are being hunted to be returned to fairyland. They are attacked by fairies and then hidden at a Slayer Inc. School. Rayne is a vampire and not having synthetic blood and being surrounded by slayers was not very reassuring and creates problems. This book was told from Rayne\u2019s perspective. Sunny was absolutely, utterly, extremely annoying in this one. She cannot get in touch with Magnus and starts whining and crying and being annoying. I could not stand her character AT ALL. Once she leaves the scene the book gets better. And by better I mean, I don\u2019t want to slam my e-reader against the wall. Little did I know it was only going to get worse. The scenes at the school were bad, but had me going along waiting to see what the mystery in the school was. But soon saw it coming a mile away. It was ridiculous too. Rayne, during her stay at this school sucks the blood of this guy (Corbin) who HATES vampires because his parents were murdered by one. He falls in love with her \u201cvamp scent\u201d and is not happy when he realizes that she is with Jared. The escape from the school was soooo choppy and unbelievable. Corbin knows how to fly a helicopter by playing virtual games. She is rescued from the school, Sunny has been kidnapped by the fairies, and Magnus chooses to rescue Sunny first and not deal with the experiments going on at Night School and threaten all vamps and paranormal kind. And of course when someone hates vamps as much as this guy Corbin does, you turn him into one.Up to this point things are not good for me and the story, but once they get to fairyland I want to stop reading and never look back. Yet I continue torturing myself. If you know a Clich\u00e9 about fairy tales, they are used here. To enter you have to wish upon a star, info given by a fairy godmother, it looks exactly like Disneyworld. Sunny is under a spell that can only be broken with a kiss. Blah, Blah, etc. If it does not sound ridiculous enough, you have to read the names given to the fairies \u201capple blossom\u201d, \u201cApple Seed\u201d. It was all so childish, in the wrong way. I was cringing inside. I was mad for having my time wasted in this. I read this series because they were quirky and funny. The story was pretty decent and it was a good few hours of mindless fun where you had to suspend reality and take everything with a grain of salt, but like I said, it was funny, crazy and fun. This book was just plain ridiculous, choppy and not interesting or funny at all. I want not only to get my $ back, but the time I wasted reading it."}, {"userName": "Danielle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2637089-danielle", "userReview": "Rayne lives in a world of vampires, vampire slayers, faeries and so much more. In her recent past she\u2019s undergone her own transformation from average teenage girl to vampire/vampire hunter and now she\u2019s learned that she herself is the heir to a powerful faerie kingdom. To escape the likelihood of capture and \u201cdeportation\u201d to \u201cfairyland\u201d her parents decide that it\u2019s best for both her and her twin sister, Sunny (yes, Rayne and Sunshine), to stow away at Riverdale Academy, a vampire slaying school. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t happen to know that Rayne is a vampire herself and this could definitely cause some potential hazardous situations, not to mention that her sister has started to act a bit strange in the process. All of this leads to the discovery of some very interesting behavior at Riverdale Academy as well as an ending that will leave you questioning whether Disneyland truly is \u201cthe happiest place on earth.\u201dThis was a complete and total escape read. From page one I was left wondering whether I was reading Night School or watching one of those comedy mash-up movies where they make fun of every recent big hit out there. Not only did the story mention books like Twilight and the True Blood series, but Disneyland and every character you can imagine, even Tinkerbell. To an extent it was quite funny, but I\u2019d have to admit at some points I was really hoping it would get into the \u201cmeat\u201d of the story. Also, at points I found myself shaking my head thinking, \u201ccould there really be one more thing?\u201d because of all the circumstances revolving around Rayne\u2019s supernatural existence. All in all though, it was pretty hilarious and I found myself chuckling on nearly each page turn.As for the story, so many parts of it were completely original. I was shocked to see how the \u201cnight school\u201d was incorporated into the story without it having been the ongoing theme throughout the series. In addition the faerie kingdom itself, though mimicking a commonly known place was still completely different from anything else I\u2019ve read before. Each of the characters, Rayne especially were original and even first time readers of the series will find themselves connected with them immediately.Overall, Night School was an incredibly fun read. I\u2019d highly recommend it for readers who like quite a bit of laughter mixed in with their reading experience. Especially fans of comedy mash-ups and pop-culture will be quite pleased. In addition to that the characters were real and easy to relate to, even for first time readers of the series. An original story with an extremely quirky and hilarious backdrop, Mari Mancusi\u2019s latest installment of her Blood Coven series is sure to please paranormal fans and leave them eagerly anticipating the next in the series."}, {"userName": "JennRenee", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3710854-jennrenee", "userReview": "Review:I believe this has been my favorite of the series for sure. I felt there was much more going on, an evil plan in the making, tricksters at their best, and so many funny antics. I was laughing out loud many times during this read. I loved this book and the series keeps getting funnier and more serious at the same time. Long story short :Rayne and Sunny find out their parents are fairies and their entire lives have been a ruse, running from the fairy courts. Now the fairies are after Sunny to be the next fairy queen. So to keep the fairies from find Sunny, the twins are rushed off to a slayer school in the Swiss Alps. It happens to be a very secluded very guarded boarding school. The least of their problems, no wireless electronics\u2026. The worst of their worries, no synthetic blood for Rayne. Not only are the twins having trouble adapting, the school is up to something and it\u2019s about to come to surface with Rayne right smack in the middle.My thoughts :Ok so there are multiple storylines going in this installment and I liked that. Sunny and Rayne start off with the same objective but when things get a little hairy\u2026 Rayne finds herself having to deal with one emergency after another. This book was for sure nonstop action and fun. When I first read the fairy part back in Bad Blood at the end, I wasn\u2019t sure where this would lead. When I started Night School, I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to like the new direction. Somewhere in the middle of the story it all just fell into place and made sense. Fairies\u2026 why not. The humor an irony of it beats all hands down.There wasn\u2019t much Sunny in this book, she had her fill in the last book. Rayne dominated and I really started to like her in this book. For once she showed me she cared more about her sister than her own needs and desires. She started to really kick butt and embrace her vampire slayer/vampire powers. She did make a few mistakes that were just stupid but easily understood. She finds her way out of her own mess with the help of Jareth of course and its all good in the end.I want to make a note about the fairyland world building, it was crazy and silly but oh so much fun. I just couldn\u2019t help but laugh my way through it. I mean really no one else could have pulled it off the way Mari Mancusi did. Loved It!I felt there was also quite a bit more action scenes in this story and that kept me on my toes. Everyone was involved in fighting even Sunny and Rayne\u2019s parents. The book is of course fast paced and a quick read like the other and I really can\u2019t wait to read on in the series.In the endI am still loving this series!"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3345952-jessica", "userReview": "Yes, this review is out of order. I'm sorry my friends! I'll post my Bad Blood (Blood Coven Vampires #4) later on tonight or early tomorrow!Once again my friends, I was hooked from the very first page. As with all the installments in this series, you can pick up the book and instantly be up to speed with what Rayne and Sunny are currently up to! Mari has a great habit of reviewing earlier events, so that no matter how long it has been since you read the last installment, you'll remember right away where you left off with these awesome and crazy twins. If you'll recall my last review, I missed the action that usually ensues in these books. This one definitely sated my action need, and then some. I'm in love!In Night School there is yet another new supernatural being added in. Yes, yes I know. You're thinking, vampires, werewolves, what else IS there? Oh but my friends, there's more. If you've read the synopsis above you now know that Sunny and Rayne face their most difficult challenge yet. FAIRIES. The way that Mari Mancusi built her fairies and their world was fantastic! I won't give too much away, it's too much fun to find out for yourself. I'll leave you instead to ponder over why these stereotypical glittery and flitting beings are so dangerous. What I will say is that I loved their names! Cracked me up to no end. Oh and the ending? Once again I'm waiting with bated breath for the next book.I think by now you've realized that I'm partial to the parts of this series that are narrated by Rayne. Let me tell you why. She's feisty, she takes on any challenge, and she loves her family with such a deep emotion that she is willing to put herself in harms way to protect them. Sunny is like the yin to Rayne's yang, and without both of them I don't think the books would be half as enjoyable. Still, I'm partial to Rayne's snark and wit. It's true. Thus why this book made me laugh out loud, and subsequently have people stare at me on the bus. Don't read this book in public.Look, if you haven't been reading my other reviews and don't yet know how I feel about this series, let me break it down plain and simple. I LOVE THESE BOOKS. The humor is smart, the characters are amazingly well written, and there is just enough tips of the hat to pop culture to keep you giggling. (References to Twilight anyone?) The point is that I should have by now convinced to you to read these books.

When I saw it I thought that this would be like Twilight -sparkling vampires, girl is in danger, cries, and the\u00b4boy come and save her. Oh my was I wrong. This is the first book I've ever read by Mari Mancusi, and even though it is the fifth book in this series I felt like I could understand the plot very well, almost as if this was a stand-alone. A lot of cred to Mari for that!I liked the plot. It was very new and realistic for being a vampire book. It was very funny and I love how it was written, because it really made me feel like I was Rayne. All her thoughts were very interesting because it made sense with her character and the way she is. Our main character, Rayne, is absolutely kick-ass. She is even funny too! She managed to get herself out of trouble alone most of the time and was very independent. I liked that, but I feel like sometimes she went a little over the line and her recklessly became a little too much. She did a lot without thinking which is something I always find annoying -even if it's for the greater good. We didn't get to see a lot of how Sunny were deep inside in this book, unfortunately. She seems very kind, graceful and aware -the perfect princess. Replacing her with a fairy who's pretending to be with her was very well done! It added a lot more to her character as well as the plot. I'm not too sure how to feel about Corbin. It was kind of predictable that they would end up with each other in one way or another (even if it wouldn't be for long and or because of food), but I still feel like he's unique. One of a kind. I might feel like that only because of the ending though. Their dad dying broke my heart! He seem like a really cool dude! I liked most things about this book. It was very cool, mew and funny!

She was so fun and delightful and gave me some great advice for my own YA novel that I wanted to check her books out. So typical me, I happened to grab a book that is right in the middle of the series. It was on the discount rack okay! Fortunately it is written in a way that everything made sense without having any previous knowledge of what\u2019s been going on. I came into knowing it is about vampires (Says so on the cover) and the cover is dark, most of it black even, so I expected the writing to be dark and teenaged vampire antsy. Far from it. It is hilarious and witty. The books follow twin sisters Rayne and Sunny. Rayne has already been turned into a vampire at this point, while Sunny is destined to become the next Queen of the Fairies against her will, because, yeah, their parents just announced to them that they are also fairies on top of everything else.Sunny is the sweet cautious sister, who yearns to be normal, while Rayne embraces everything supernatural. Throughout the book, she jumps headlong into situations\u2014most of them she causes\u2014but it\u2019s her love and devotion to her sister that eventually sees her way through it with laugh out loud humor such as:Mom stands her ground, shoulders back, a fierce mama-bear expression taking hold of her usually serene, hippie-chick face.

It was good! The characters are just so lovable, and there are so many twists and turns! For example, we have Payne being a vampire, vampire slayer, and fairy all in one. Then the Corbin turning into a vamp (actually, this was one of those predictable twists, know what I mean?). I'm glad Rayne didn't do too much with Corbin - Jareth's her one and only! Speaking of one and only's, what's up with Magnus and Sunny? I know this wasn't focused on them, but in was definitely lacking romance and eternal love vibe. The entire story became almost clich\u00e9d, actually. The pop-culture and Disney references became a bit much, if you ask me. It took away from the story, even if the Disney references were supposed to be the whole point (humor wise) anyway. Probably unnecessary, in my opinion. A few things really did add to the story - her dad dying, her mom stepping in the court, and all that stuff, It was just that a lot of things were going on - the Slayer conspiracy, the fairies, Corbin's vampire issue (being AWOL and all that). I promise I'm not saying it's bad - I read it pretty much in one sitting (the bulk of it anyway)! Still, I feel a bit scattered in this book. My thoughts are all over the place.

It was a book full of many twists and turns, I could never guess where Mancusi was taking readers.The characters in Night School were a mix. I felt some of the characters were undeveloped while others really grew and developed more. Headmistress Roberta felt very unreal to me, and I didn't get much grasp of her as a person. Rayne on the other hand, grew a lot and some of her immaturity issues I had problems with in the past disappeared. The addition of new characters adds a lot to this great series.The plot in Night School constantly had me guessing! I wasn't able to guess as all where it was going. Mancusi threw in so many twists, I was constantly surprised, and I absolutely love the direction the story went off in. I really like how this series isn't strictly vampires but throughout the books have incorporated other paranormals. It's a lot of fun to read. I can't wait for the next book, Blood Ties. After the epic ending of Night School, Blood Ties is sure going to be good! I love how this series constantly gets better and better."}, {"userName": "Brittany's Bookish Things", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4310844-brittany-s-bookish-things", "userReview": "I love this series but I have to admit that when we found out at the end of book 4 that they were fairies I was very excited about reading this.

It was even better than the others, it was so funny at times I found my self laughing out loud and having people look at me weird.

Sunny McDonald was \u201caccidentally\u201d bitten by Magnus, the current Blood Coven Master, and nearly turned into a vampire. Magnus thought he was actually biting Rayne, her identical twin who had already gone through all the training, including giving blood to be blood matched with her new mate for eternity. Thankfully, Magnus and Sunny find the Holy Grail, which she drinks from to revert the process and remain mortal. Her blood, however, is highly toxic to vampires now. (Boys That Bite)2. In Stake That! Rayne learns that she has been chosen to become the next vampire slayer, and that she has nanobots in her blood stream that if triggered, will kill her. She has no choice but to accept the position. Under orders from Magnus, Rayne and Jared, a vampire who at the time was Magnus\u2019 second-in-command and general of the Blood Coven, go undercover to discover who is trying to poison the blood supply for the vampires. Rayne stops the villain, and is subsequently poisoned, along with Jared. Jared turns her into a vampire, which has been what she\u2019s wanted all along.3. Girls That Growl, is also in the POV of Rayne. This time it is werewolves she must stop from taking over the school and town in which they live in. Rayne and Jared fly to England and search for the culprit who infected an entire squad of cheerleaders. Rayne becomes one herself, which shocked everyone. Rayne also embarrasses herself by pulling a stake at the house of the local coven, much to the annoyance of Jared who asks her to get help with her anger issues. 4. Bad Blood goes back to Sunny's POV and finds Jane Johnson attempting to infiltrate the blood coven and bring Magnus to his knees. It is also where she meets and be-friends Jayden in Las Vegas, who will play another role in the last book of the series. Sunny finds a way to expose Jane, and save the Blood Coven and Magnus. Rayne and Sunny also discover they have a half-sister who they never met, and she and Sunny hit it off pretty nicely. Later the twins discover that her parents have been lying to them about their true heritage. Sunny and Rayne are actually fairy princess. No Joke Smoke! So now Rayne is a fairy princess, vampire, and vampire slayer. Confused yet? ---continue on my wayward friends!Night School by Mari Mancusi is book 5 in the series and has Sunny and Rayne McDonald shipped off to Riverdale a Vampire Slayer School after being discovered by Fairy Apple Blossom in Las Vegas shortly after discovering their true heritage. This story reverts back to Rayne\u2019s POV, and she has some serious issues to deal with.1. We learn that Heather is actually an operative with Slayer Inc. Fairy Division, and helped the mother and father escape from Fairy. Heather isn\u2019t really an evil step mother as they originally thought. **Wondering however, why the step sister wasn't in danger as well, since technically she has fairy blood in her body as well? Uhm, Ms Mancusi, an explaination please?2. Mother is a Fairy Princess called Shrinking Violet and Heir to the Light Court of Fairy. Her mother, Tatiana, was killed by the dark court. (Or so it was thought) Father was her guardian who she fell in love with and fled, and in the process, removed their wings to blend in with the mortal world.3. Sunny is named princess to be by the Sidhe court, something she has no inclination to accept. She wants Magnus and nothing more.4. We are told that once a fairy hits puberty, they\u2019re supposed to go through a magical ceremony to kick start their transformation, and gain their wings. Even without wings, fairies retain their powers.5. After Apple Blossoms\u2019 arrival and attempt to take the twins back to fairy, they are sent to Riverdale where they are thought to be safe from the Fairies themselves. It's, of course, thought wrong. 6. Rayne finds herself in a school full of vampire slayers with absolutely no blood synthetic to drink from, and not wanting anyone to know that she\u2019s a vampire. She ignores hints by a fellow student named Lilli when she offers red Kool-aid to drink. She is still hurt knowing that her parents lied to her and Sunny, and now, neither has any contact with Magnus or Jared.7. Rayne and Sunny try to escape the school and find themselves with the Alpha Slayers. Soon after, they are attacked by Fairies led by Apple Blossom, and Rayne ends up biting Corbin Billingsworth III and drinking human blood for the first time since she was turned into a vampire. This speeds up the healing process but Corbin becomes infatuated with Rayne. Sunny seemingly changes overnight and starts sleeping with other students, which she would have never done prior to arriving at the school.8. Rayne goes through the ritual process to transform into a fairy, and gains her wings. Now, she is definitely a fairy, vampire, and vampire slayer all at once. She claims to have done it to protect Sunny from being forced against her will, to lose her mortality, and to become fairy Queen. She also has the inability to lie, something fairies are supposed to adhere to, but somehow find a way around it time and time again.9. Rayne believes there is something wrong with Sunny and discovers that on the night they were attacked, Sunny was taken and a Sunny changeling was left in her place. The real Sunny is to become queen against her will.10. After Corbin is bitten a second time by Rayne, the school discovers that she is a new breed called Vamshee, and takes a sample of her blood to be used to create a whole new breed of slayers. The only problem is, they want it to be for nefarious uses, not for fighting evil vampires. Night School is actually a moniker for transforming the best of the Alpha's into a new vampire hybrid. They haven't been successful until Rayne's arrival on campus.11. Rachel, who was poisoned in the book Stake That! is now a vampire and comes to Rayne\u2019s rescue. She also pays the ultimate price for helping.12. Corbin and Rayne meet up with Jared and Magnus, and tell them everything that has happened at the Slayer School. Rayne, however, still has bloodlust issues from drinking real blood, and drains Corbin nearly to death. Jared is furious and ends up turning Corbin into a vampire, and getting Rayne to promise to go to rehab (Bloody Ford Clinic)<--if you seriously don\u2019t get this reference\u2026see me.In the end, Magnus, Jared, and Rayne find a way into Fairy (Disney World) where Cinderella and other fairy tale characters are real. Her father is struck down after killing Apple Blossom with Iron, and Magnus kisses Sunny breaking the spell and saving her from marrying Apple Seed, and thus becoming queen of the light court. Their mother takes the crown instead after exposing that Apple Blossom was the one who killed Tatiana, and spelling Sunny to go to Fairy against her will. Sunny decides to keep her wings, while Corbin escapes from the Blood Coven with top secret documents in hand.Blood Ties releases August 2011, and it's supposed to be the last book in the series from what I'm hearing. It also appears to be from Sunny's POV, which will be interesting now that Rayne is a full fledged vampire without her fairy wings. Sunny, it appears, decides to keep her wings, and embrace her heritage.This series, at times, annoys me, but to the point of rolling my eyes at the references to other YA books like Twilight and Vampire Academy. Haven't we had enough of the sparking vampires for a lifetime? The world view that fairy is actually Disney World in Orlando, Florida, was almost too weird to actually read. Rayne has come back from being an annoying loser in the last book, to nearly likable in this one. She still has major issues with her attitude, and not following directions from Magnus and Jared. Her being sent to Bloody Ford Clinic for rehab, nearly made me spill soda on myself.

I know that they are silly. I know they are ridiculous. I know they are going to have insane adventures and half the time make no sense and just have the craziest lines and be so silly, but that's why I like them. Sometimes what you need is not a book that tears out your soul or brings you to tears or makes you feel like something life changing happened when the book is over and have it leave you with a book hangover. Sometimes you need a Blood Coven book. One that you can read in one or two sittings, one that you know it will have a happy ending and you're just along for the ride, and one that will still make you want to see what goofy adventures come up next. Sometimes we need more books like this in our lives."}, {"userName": "Sheila", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/77419757-sheila", "userReview": "This was a interesting part of Rayne and Sunny story.This book wasn't what I would have expected.They are from fairyland?

Woah, I really like the serie but let be honest!!!The book is stupid! Nothing is matching together. The author should think about her writing skills sometimes...How can I mix the twilight saga and true blood? If I Am not wrong New Moon --> 2006 and true blood as tv serie should be aired around 2008? So...can't be that the both girls are 17 ...How she mixed everything buffy , true blood, twilight saga they would be around 19~21!But ok! Thats not much what I point out negative in the book...At first I truly HATE FAIRIES ! They are the worst fantasy character ever. So everything what I write now is just my subjective opinion!While reading I thought why...are the guys away? Both sister together is awful..Terrible...So boring to read !After the two guys are back in the story the whole story went mhm funnier? But still I hate fairies they're so stupid ...and dumb and...I hate dumb stuff.So the author underlined my hate, because she descriped them as dumb as I was expecting them to be...awful....Also how can their Mom not know that her children boyfriends are vampire?She is a damn fairy...To my opinion if my mum would that be stupid I wouldn't trust her my life in her hands and would stay at a school like this....!So back to the sister ...truly they are often not like there character should be...often they are so immature that its not realstic how mature they are sometimes. I started to laugh when Rainey cared of colbin ( was that his name? I remember names badly) like as he would be child...To be honest she is more like the true child.Also the boyfriends are so stupid if I would be over thousandth years old I would not trust an immature 17 year old girl.I would have killed Colbin , because what is his use? Or maybe they could have blackmailed him...No, they let it end how the end is going to be ( in my opinion really unrealistic how the story went ) ...but Margnus told Rainey they going to kill him if he wants to stake someone but he is angry that Rainey bites him after he nearly killed Rainey and because of the fight he was full of blood?! Sorry, I don't think Rainey needs rehab I think the author need realstic thinking or maybe she should remember what she wrote some pages before. Truly I gave the other books REALLY good ratings and I criticized less!For me I knew that the blood coven serie wouldn't be perfect and I haven't aspected much. I knew I was not reading one of the best books in the world. But to be honest everyone can let the story be a bit realstic. I don't want much realstic, because its still a fantasy book. But even if its a fantasy book no one can write a fantasy book without realistic moments. So Magnus should have scolded Jareth that he turned him, because as he said the guy is going to be killed if he wants to kill some vampire. Or both are vampires and if I remember right Colbind has various cuts so how should Rainey have resists if its her nature? It's not that she just was hungry and take a bite... Thats why I only gave 2 starts.My first intention was to give 3,but to be honest I haven't liked the stupid idea of story in the book or I've liked how the author described the characters of the book.Truly I gave two stars, because at the end the book was quite funny and I always thought Tinkerbell is a bitch when I was young.So is there still anything to say? I hope that the six book lets me feel better...besides I think book 8 is going to have only one star, because as I wrote in my first review of the serie I hate if problems are delayed in a book, because at the end the problems are coming back and everything is going to be unrealistic. Also without to solve the problems a happy ending would be impossible, so nerve-wracking the problem is coming back and every reader thinks:'' why I read book 2 until 7 ? 1 and 8 would have been enough!'' . End....Sorry for my harsh review...Just my opinion and every fairy lover sorry too but I never liked fairies..."}], "description": "Vampires, Slayers and\u2026FAIRIES?
