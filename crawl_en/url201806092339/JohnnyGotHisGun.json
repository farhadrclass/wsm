I think I finished it in five sittings, with great big tears rolling down my face. While everybody around me was busy quaffing scalding hot lattes, I was trying to muffle the sounds of my agonized weeping into my scarf. Luckily, this is not seen as strange behavior in Manhattan, so I was able to finish the book unmolested. Johnny Got His Gun sounds like it was written during the early stages of the Vietnam War (I think because the tone is very Salinger-esque), but it's actually set during WW I. The ending makes you want to slit your wrists, but in a good way. This is a great book to read when you're facing a dark time in your life. I don't think life could be any worse than this protagonist's, who has lost his arms and legs, in addition to sustaining serious burns to his face as results of injuries he incurred on the battlefield.For some reason, I group this book with \nFlowers for Algernon\n and I Am the Cheese, maybe because all three have similar themes of spoiled youth and corrupt government machinations. Fun fact: This book was written by Dalton Trumbo, who was one of the infamous Hollywood Ten that got blacklisted by House on UnAmerican Activities Committee for having left-leaning political sensibilities. Thankfully, he managed to keep working despite other people's attempts to rid Hollywood of Communists, going on to pen the screenplays to Spartacus, The Horsemen, and Papillion. These scripts were in addition to an already impressive roster of films that include Roman Holiday, Kitty Foyle, and I Married a Witch, . So suck on that, Elia Kazan!!!"}, {"userName": "Bill  Kerwin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83582-bill-kerwin", "userReview": "A scathing anti-war novel, in which the main character is one of the profoundly, hopelessly wounded, the human wrecks of war. It is told in the first person, by the voice of a person now voiceless, trapped in his mutilated body, confined to his hospital bed, and--as this person virtually unable to communicate communicates with the reader, telling us his story--we come to realize the true cost--and futility--of war.This is an angry, honest book. Thoroughly memorable."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "This novel about an American soldier who was severely wounded while fighting in World War I was so disturbing it took me several tries to get through it.The novel is told in a stream of consciousness, with soldier Joe drifting in and out of memories of his parents, of girlfriends, of more innocent days. He slowly realizes that he has no arms, no legs and no face, and his cries are gut-wrenching. I listened to this book on audio, and the performance by William Dufris was so affecting that I had to take breaks from the book. I'm glad I came back to it and kept going, because this is a moving story about how much soldiers can suffer.I was inspired to read Johnny Got His Gun after it was mentioned in Ann Hood's bookish memoir Morningstar. She wrote an essay about how she had first read Dalton Trumbo's book while growing up during the Vietnam war, and how meaningful it had been. Now I've read it while the United States is preparing to send more troops to Afghanistan, and I also found it to be a powerful experience.This is a challenging and thought-provoking book, and I would recommend it to readers who appreciate anti-war novels.Note on StyleOne last note is that while I did listen to this novel, I also got a print copy to flip through and mark quotes. Trumbo used little punctuation for Joe's rambling thoughts \u2014 the writing style reminded me of Kerouac's On the Road, except Trumbo did it in 1939, nearly 20 years before Jack's famous Beat novel. I think the audiobook performance made it easier to read and appreciate Johnny Got His Gun. If you've tried to read this book before and struggled with the run-on sentences, I recommend trying the audio. Meaningful Passages\"This was no war for you. This thing wasn't any of your business. What do you care about making the world safe for democracy? All you wanted to do Joe was to live. You were born and raised in the good healthy country of Colorado and you had no more to do with Germany or England or France or even with Washington D.C. than you had to do with the man on the moon. Yet here you are and it was none of your affair. Here you are Joe and you're hurt worse than you think. You're hurt bad. Maybe it would be a lot better if you were dead and buried on the hill across the river from Shale City. Maybe there are more things wrong with you than you suspect Joe. Oh why the hell did you ever get into this mess anyhow? Because it wasn't your fight Joe. You never really knew what the fight was all about.\"\"There's nothing noble about dying. Not even if you die for honor. Not even if you die the greatest hero the world ever saw. Not even if you're so great your name will never be forgotten and who's that great? The most important thing is your life little guys. You're worth nothing dead except for speeches. Don't let them kid you any more. Pay no attention when they tap you on the shoulder and say come along we've got to fight for liberty or whatever their word is there's always a word. Just say mister I'm sorry I got no time to die I'm too busy and then turn and run like hell. If they say coward why don't pay attention because it's your job to live not to die. If they talk about dying for principles that are bigger than life you say mister you're a liar. Nothing is bigger than life. There's nothing noble in death. What's noble about lying in the ground and rotting? What's noble about never seeing the sunshine again? What's noble about having your legs and arms blown off? What's noble about being an idiot? What's noble about being blind and deaf and dumb? What's noble about being dead? Because when you're dead mister it's all over. It's the end. You're less than a dog less than a rat less than a bee or an ant less than a little white maggot crawling around on a dungheap. You're dead mister and you died for nothing.\"\"We are men of peace we are men who work and we want no quarrel. But if you destroy our peace if you take away our work if you try to range us one against the other we will know what to do. If you tell us to make the world safe for democracy we will take you seriously and by god and by Christ we will make it so. We will use the guns you force upon us we will use them to defend our very lives and the menace to our lives does not lie on the other side of a nomansland that was set apart without our consent it lies within our own boundaries here and now we have seen it and we know it.\""}, {"userName": "Esteban del Mal", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2251009-esteban-del-mal", "userReview": "What do you call a guy with no arms and no legs in the water?Bob.What do you call a guy with no arms and no legs on a porch?Matt.What do you call a guy with no arms and no legs on skis?Skip.What do you call a novel about a guy who has no arms and no legs because he happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time? Johnny Got His Gun.***This works best as a character sketch. As poor Jon Bonham's consciousness recalls the events of his childhood, he simultaneously realizes he has missing appendages (and a missing face). And when the two threads meet, we are put in his mind alongside him. He is an inert trunk tucked away in a hospital because a German shell blew him apart in the horrifying attrition of WWI. It's like epiphenomenalism in reverse with a double shot of God is Dead. What I have difficulty with is:1.) his sophistication. He seems quite exceptional for Dalton's purpose of representing an average American Doughboy. Did your typical twenty-something male have a knowledge of Carthaginian history back then?2.) his sanity. He goes insane at the end, but could someone in complete isolation keep it together for several years? I doubt it. (And my mom always told me that I'm exceptional, so there.)3.) the dissolution into didacticism. The final few pages are a screed on par with Charlie Chaplin in The Great Dictator. The difference is, I buy Charlie's speech because he's knee deep in satire and it's not as jarring when he steps out of that satire. Maybe this is unfair, but Trumbo's effort is affected and, dare I say, as unnatural as the devices that conspire to keep his protagonist's body alive while neglecting his mind. Maybe Trumbo believes he has captured the reader to the extent that he can preach to him/her. I guess most people coming to the novel are looking to be preached at. I was not. 4.) it won't convince today's youth about the horrors of war because they've been inured to such things with their Xbox 360s. Besides, Bonham is eventually able to communicate with hospital staff through Morse Code. Unless salvation can be texted, kids these days aren't interested.All the same, war can suck it.And somebody give these hippies a haircut."}, {"userName": "Candace Morris", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/119789-candace-morris", "userReview": "Every time I read a book, I feel committed to it as if to a relationship. That relationship can be an infatuational fling, a carnal attraction, a passionate love, a committed best friend, a life partner...whatever form it takes will depend on how much I will remember it. Johnny Got His Gun got completely under my skin.I was finishing the last page on an airplane and an 80 year old yoga teacher looked at me and quietly summed up this book. \"I remember reading that. It blew my mind...\" She had read it in 1965!I have always considered myself a political pacifist. I realized this is because I shelter, absolutely shelter myself from the horrifics of war and violence. I have always chosen to live in the dark because I KNEW the rage would overtake me if I chose to care. Well, Trumbo sure as hell got me to care. Even if this never changes the fact that I don\u2019t vote...this absolutely got me to give a damn and know why I hate war.I would have made my students read this when I was teaching - if I had known about it.If you don't read anything this year - read this.This book is like my first love. It will appear to me in my sleep. It will haunt my mind forever. It will be the year 2058, and I will see a young girl reading this on a airplane and be launched into delicious nostalgia."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Johnny Got His Gun, Dalton Trumbo (1905 - 1976)Johnny Got His Gun is a novel written in 1938 by American novelist and screenwriter Dalton Trumbo and published September 1939 by J. B. Lippincott. The novel is commonly viewed as one that promotes anti-war ideals, but when read deeper, it can be seen that Trumbo's opinions of war shed light on humanity as a whole, and not just on the horrible aspects of war. The novel won one of the early National Book Awards: the Most Original Book of 1939.Joe Bonham, a young American soldier serving in World War I, awakens in a hospital bed after being caught in the blast of an exploding artillery shell. He gradually realizes that he has lost his arms, legs, and all of his face (including his eyes, ears, teeth, and tongue), but that his mind functions perfectly, leaving him a prisoner in his own body.

Unsurprisingly, its powerful anti-war message also had a profound effect on Americans during the Vietnam era.Dalton Trumbo conveys this anti-war message across 20 short chapters, each explores a different aspect of Joe\u2019s life before the war, or his thoughts on his current predicament. As his thoughts become more lucid, he realises he has been left deaf, dumb and blind and that all four of his limbs have subsequently been amputated. His face has also been disfigured and is covered by a mask to avoid distressing the hospital staff.Dalton Trumbo was also a screenwriter and he was later blacklisted and jailed for being a Communist. His political views are to the fore in this convincing argument for peace and cooperation, and against the futility and waste of war. War is explained as \"us\" versus \"them\": \"us\" being the working classes and \u201cthem\" being those with money who do not do any fighting but whose interests are served by war. Joe also muses on the abstract, nebulous language that is used to justify war - democracy, freedom, liberty etc.For all the arguments in favour of pacifism it is when Joe is musing on aspects of his life before the war that this book really succeeds. Most of these memories involve moments of loss for Joe, and these mirror the physical losses that Joe has sustained. Johnny Got His Gun is one of the most original, clever and powerful novels I\u2019ve ever read. It\u2019s a little uneven in places but overall it\u2019s unforgettable, and rightly regarded as classic American literature.4/5"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5304930-mary", "userReview": "Johnny rips its own heart out and throws it in your face.

Trumbo's novel had been the exemplar for all anti-war novels, in my mind, until I read Barry's work a few weeks ago and he redefined my perception of excellence in this genre.Joe Bonham is what Willie Dunne might have become, it struck me, as I was re-reading Johnny if he had not succumbed fatally to that final shell impact. There's the same strong rhythm of agony and torment driven by the complexity of damnation and hope in the face of eventual, and assured, death. The layers of complexity are so intricately layered, that you move from anguish to relief simultaneously in the same paragraph, sometimes in the same thought. It really is possible, in the end, to hold two thoughts in your mind, at the same time, with equal intensity, and not become completely mad: that is the the anguish of war. To want to fight, and defend, and stand true to one's principles; and equally, to want to run like hell and find a rabbit hole, and never come out. Both Trumbo and Barry achieve this complicated equilibrium and never let up.Trumbo's anguish is more punchy and didactic, much like the assured rhythm of a machine gun, delivering bursts of energy and fatal information all in one. Barry on the other hand, is more operatic where the orchestra sometimes slows, but never stops completely, and then moves on to new crescendoes. Both are dazzling works of invention that dance so close to the truth it is indistinguishable from it; both deliver the same message, that war is hell and why do we do it; both are vital and indispensable works against the Great War Machine."}, {"userName": "\u0386\u03bd\u03bd\u03b1 \u039c\u03b1\u03ba\u03c1\u03ae", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64210482", "userReview": "\u0395\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9, \u03c4\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c9 \u03b3\u03b9' \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf; \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03ac \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03ac\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9. \u039c\u03b9\u03bb\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c4\u03b7.  \u0388\u03c7\u03b5\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c6\u03b1\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03af \u03c0\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b6\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c3\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03ac\u03bb\u03b9 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03af, \u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b7 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03c3\u03ba\u03ad\u03c8\u03b7, \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03af\u03c3\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u03b1, \u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03bc\u03bd\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7, \u03c6\u03cc\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2, \u03b7 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03bb\u03b1\u03c7\u03c4\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03ba\u03ac\u03b8\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ae \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03bc\u03af\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b9\u03c9\u03bd\u03b9\u03cc\u03c4\u03b7\u03c4\u03b1, \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ad\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03b5\u03af\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03c3\u03ce\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9, \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03b1\u03c2 \u03be\u03c5\u03c0\u03bd\u03ae\u03c3\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b5\u03c6\u03b9\u03ac\u03bb\u03c4\u03b7; (\u03a0\u03c9 \u03c0\u03c9, \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03c5\u03bc\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ac\u03c8\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03ad\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b9\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03bc\u03ad\u03c2, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b9\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03cd\u03b3\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bb\u03ac\u03ba\u03c9\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c4\u03ae\u03b8\u03bf\u03c2)."}, {"userName": "Pink", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14084605-pink", "userReview": "Great novel, with a message I completely agree with.

It would be a bit macho, full of robust sentences and I'd be properly disgusted by all the bloody descriptions.And I was wrong. How can a man write a book whose narrator is a young guy with no arms, no legs, no face, blind and deaf and who is in and out of consciousness, never reliable, who spends his endless dark hours thinking or fighting sleep and have me flipping pages furiously like I was reading the most riveting adventure?I don't know what kind of mind a writer has to have to pull something like that off. I was so hooked into Johnny's mind and so moved by his plight to communicate and then so horrified, too.I mean... this book isn't for the weak of heart. It's a terrible tale. And yet, though the whole story revolves around war, death, wounds, blood, grief, loss and paralysis, it's also one of the most powerful homages to life I've ever read. That's the paradox. There are such beautiful passages in the book when Johnny remembers his ordinary but so precious life in Colorado with his family and his friends or girl and in those parts, Trumbo becomes almost Proustian in his attention to detail. You can taste and smell the jams and bread Johnny's mother use to make. Every memory is so vividly recounted that you begin to think of your own ordinary memories and travel down your own life and then that's where Trumbo gets you.You finish this bleak and sorrowful book with an immense gratitude. You are not Johnny and life is so good."}, {"userName": "\u039c\u03b1\u03bd\u03ce\u03bb\u03b7\u03c2 \u03a3\u03b9\u03bc\u03b9\u03c4\u03c3\u03ac\u03ba\u03b7\u03c2", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2013",

In particular, I witnessed an up-close-and-personal visit with one of it's many casualties in a unique writing style I had not experienced before. It was a narrative that yearned to be heard.1918 was not a good year in America to be a healthy male between the ages of 18 and 26. America was in the throes of the Great War. To meet the costly demand, bodies were desperately needed. It was time for our uncle to step in.Unfortunately, luck had not been kind to Joe Bonham. At the ripe age of nineteen, his number for the draft had been called. Just when life couldn't have been any better - a down-to-earth home life, a loving sweetheart and a satisfying job to round things out. Livin' the dream. Shattered.After four months of cursory training, He found himself in France with the rank and file doughboys. He had survived there almost a year until one fateful day had finally arrived. His life as he had known, as he adored it, had taken a drastic turn for the worse.Confined to only the boundaries of his mind after a bomb had blown him to smithereens, Joe struggled to find meaning to his loathsome existence. What to do, where to start, when all four limbs had been lost and only half a face remained. Once whole, now reduced to a mere slab of meat. Meat with a brain. Thinking...We sing praises to those lives lost in war yet we seem to forget through many generations the countless victims who return not whole. It serves as a reminder for all to see the outcome of deadly conflict. Those sad reminders can't be swept under the carpet.To those returning from war, they find that their home, their Shale City is not the same. In a sense, they are strangers no matter where they go. They always will be. Outsiders looking in. In the end, there's no one available to assemble the broken pieces."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/690315-andy", "userReview": "\u201cBut it wasn't a dream\u201d (Trumbo 63).Since it's publication during World War II, through various wars and political movements, Johnny Got His Gun has been a book in the spotlight. Of course, Trumbo was a member of the Hollywood Ten, and the book was banned, but it has always found it's way into the hands of pacifists, and is still considered among the best anti-war novels to ever be published. Is there truth to this statement? Is the book still as relevant as it was upon it's release or even during the Vietnam war? In a word: absolutely.In his introduction to Johnny Got His Gun, Dalton Trumbo describes World War I as the last of the \u201cromantic wars.\u201d While I have just discussed how war is far from romantic, I believe that Trumbo has a point with his statement. What he is saying is that World War I was the big war that served to open up the eyes of the world and cause the general public to finally understand that they were being lied to. This is not to say there wasn't dissenters and pacifists prior to World War I, but it is saying that they were being silenced and that the general public didn't want to listen to them. After the countless injuries and deaths incurred from World War I, including a most extreme (and fictional) case detailed in this book, the public began to take a stand and speak out against war. Johnny Got His Gun has been a massively popular book for the harsh story that it tells, showing the pain that the massively crippled can endure. It's a reality that no one wants to face, and it's not the only book of it's kind, but it was one of the first landmark, much-read books to tell this story. Following 9/11, the United States of America went into a flag waving frenzy. This carried over for many years, and is still prevalent today, in 2008. Patriotism was bred out of catastrophe, an unjust and unrelated war stemmed from this sense of patriotism, and 5 years later is still going on as planned, with people turning their shoulders rather than participating in continuous protests. We are still lied to. The amount of money that goes into the war is glossed over, while nationwide, programs are cut, and people don't realize the correlation. Our soldiers are not dying, that's a good thing right? We have less casualties than any other war we have participated in. Yet, we also have more serious, life-altering injuries than ever before as well. They're alive, but are they functional? It's opening up a wave of jobs to cater to this veterans, that's a good thing, but at what cost? \u201cWhen armies move and flags wave and slogans pop up watch out little guy because it's somebody else's chestnuts in the fire, not yours\u201d (114).Over time, Johnny Got His Gun has become the book most synonymous with the anti-war sentiment around the world. The brutal imagery coupled with an alarmingly real portrayal of what a victim might be going through internally is what gives this novel an edge over similar texts. The stream-of-consciousness prose, the near-insane jumping back and forth between the present and the past and the details of the pain that Joe Bonham is going through can turn the the stomach and hearts of even the hardest of us all. When comparing his situation to that of an American slave who had gone through unheard of torture and beatings, Joe says one of the most revelatory and arresting things I've ever read, \u201c...the slaves could always die but he couldn't and he was mutilated far beyond any slave who ever live\u201d (183). In this scene, the reality that Joe is truly powerless finally hits the reader. Thrust into this war, blown to smithereens, immobile, incommunicable, we have felt the pain that Joe is going through up until this point. But when we realize he hasn't even the power to end his own life, his only wish at this point. That's something that is hard to stomach. But it was all for \u201cfreedom and democracy.\u201dCertainly Dalton Trumbo was an extraordinary writer in many mediums, even the government knew that. However it is the reading of this book and the effect it has on people that can be a catalyst for those to stand up for what they believe and speak out against war. Joe was an ordinary guy, but it is through his struggles that we, the reader, connect. The societal change is ours for the changing, and we only need to push harder. Trumbo, the author and Joe Bonham, the brain both know and they tell us, \u201cPeople wouldn't learn much about anatomy from him but they would learn all there was to know about war\u201d (224). No matter how hard others try to deny us the truth and no matter how hard we try to ignore it, it's real.So you're right Joe, you're right Mr. Trumbo. It wasn't a dream."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5364077-connie", "userReview": "Author Dalton Trumbo was inspired by a newspaper story about a Canadian soldier in World War I who had lost all his limbs and all his senses except for the sense of touch. He created Joe Bonham, a soldier whose mind was still active, but who was unable to communicate with the outside world except for tapping his head. The story takes us inside Joe's head to his stream of consciousness thoughts, sometimes thinking about ideologies and often flashing back to the past. For example, his thoughts go back to holding his girlfriend in his arms when he realizes that his arms have been amputated. The flashbacks show us how much Joe has lost, both physically and emotionally. The story shows the destructive power of modern weapons. It also points out how wealthy capitalists profit from war while the working class does most of the fighting. Sometimes it seems like the more educated author's voice takes over Joe's voice when Joe thinks about politics. Joe would like to be part of a traveling exhibit to show people the horror of war.This pacifist book was published in September 1939, two days after Germany invaded Poland. The book is about World War I, was published during World War II, became very popular during the war in Vietnam, and is still in print today. The title is based on the refrain, \"Johnny Get Your Gun\", from the American World War I song \"Over There\".The author's life is as interesting as the book, and has recently been made into the movie, \"Trumbo\", starring Bryan Cranston. Trumbo was one of the Hollywood 10 who refused to answer questions when they were called to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities, headed by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Trumbo was jailed for one year and blacklisted, although he continued screenwriting under assumed names for the black market.\"Johnny Got His Gun\" is the kind of book that the reader will not forget. It's a good reminder that war is not all glory, to recognize the huge sacrifices that our veterans have made, and to value good diplomats in today's world."}, {"userName": "Kayla", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35623333-kayla", "userReview": "Now that the war is through with meI'm waking up, I cannot seeThat there is not much left of meNothing is real but pain nowHold my breath as I wish for deathOh please, God, wake me--DarknessImprisoning meAll that I seeAbsolute horrorI cannot liveI cannot dieTrapped in myselfBody my holding cellLandmineHas taken my sightTaken my speechTaken my hearingTaken my armsTaken my legsTaken my soulLeft me with life in hell\nThe famous lyrics from Metallica's \"One\" from the perspective of Joe Bonham, wounded soldier who was blown nearly to smithereens by a landmine during World War I. He has lost both of his legs, both of his arms, his ears, and his entire face and still managed to survive, with nothing but his own mind to keep him company. Metallica wrote the song based on the book and used clips from the 1971 film Johnny Got His Gun for the music video. Fun fact: Metallica actually bought the rights to the film so they could keep showing the music video without paying royalties. I want to say that I absolutely loved this book, but \"love\" is such a weird word to use in this situation because this novel is horrifying. I can't love the casualties of war. I can't love the situation that Joe is in. I can't love that only a few years after this book was written and published, World War II happened. I can't love the awful that is war. The one thing I can love is Dalton Trumbo's phenomenal writing throughout this entire novel and his ability to make you feel \nall\n the feels for Joe Bonham. I can also love his ability to make you either question how you feel about war or confirm what you already felt about it. I have read that people became pacifist's after reading this novel, so I'm not the only one that thinks it's powerful as heck. The way Trumbo wrote this book is very interesting. He used a third-person narrative combined with a \"stream of consciousness\" style of writing. This is a cool combination because even though we spend the entire novel inside Joe's head, Joe never refers to himself as \"I\" - it's always \"he\". Perhaps this was done to make it even more obvious that Joe has no control over anything in his current situation because \"I\" is a lot more controlling than \"he\". If so, that is genius writing. The novel has long sentences, lots of repetition of certain words/phrases, and lack of punctuation to mimic real thoughts in a person's head, \nespecially\n under moments of stress, anxiety, sheer joy, and happiness. For some people, these reasons may mean that they have a hard time reading this novel, though I would urge to please appreciate it for what it is as it is the best choice for this story. Personally, I loved the writing style and I don't think this novel would have had the same impact if it was written any other way. If you think Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five is an amazing anti-war novel and you haven't read this one, you probably should. This book affected me way more than SF did. There were quite a few times where I had to stop reading, close the book and just sit there absorbing what I just read. You experience present Joe with his tasks of trying to figure out how to track time and communicate with his nurse, as well as his incredibly deep thoughts and reflections about the war and what has happened to him. You also experience his flashbacks to his life before the war. This book had it all. I am not ashamed to say that I balled my eyes out while reading Chapter 10. That chapter is the most powerful part of any book I have read in my life. In addition, I have \"liked\" a few of the best quotes from the book that will hopefully show up on this review.I would rate this book more stars if I could. If it was a 10 star system, it would get 10 stars.

They forgot the thing they were fighting for the things they were dying for. They thought about things a man can understand. They died yearning for the face of a friend. They died whimpering for the voice of a mother a father a wife a child They died with their hearts sick for one more look at the place where they were born please god just one more look. They died moaning and sighing for life. They knew what was important They knew that life was everything and they died with screams and sobs. They died with only one thought in their minds and that was I want to live I want to live I want to live.\" I finally realized that beyond the passionate exposition of the cost of war, to the extent that the author and the publisher pulled the book during WWII, its really a horror novel.

Its a screaming indictment of inhumanity and the saddest, most depressing book I have ever read. Highly recommended, just be prepared for it to haunt you."}, {"userName": "BAM The Bibliomaniac ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6595648-bam-the-bibliomaniac", "userReview": "I don't agree with the main sentiment in this book. There IS nobility in death, in dying for principles, for those who are weaker.Having said that, I was still moved by the frustration and disability of the main character. His strong desire to live and his poignant acceptance of loss were communicated not only literally but also figuratively through his flashbacks to happier times in his life, to the terms before the war and his body's destruction. The author takes a passive stance toward battle and those young men who go to fight and face their demise. There is fear, incredulity, denial, but most volunteer bravely to uphold the principles of our nation. I did not agree with the argument of \"America being just as free as Australia or Canada\" at all. In fact I had to turn off the book for a few minutes while I debated, I was so upset. It's not the same at all. The book definitely did its job at stirring up thought and discussion. It seems to go out of print when its ideals become unpopular to the government. I'm glad I got to see the other side of the argument."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1778744-hannah", "userReview": "I've never had a book give me a panic attack before, but this one.... This one is disturbingly thorough in its purpose. It made me feel claustrophobic, alone, and dark. It kept me awake at night. This book is timeless. It doesn't matter what war, what era, or what the skewed justifications offered may be. The result is the same. The result is Joe. Dalton Trumbo has a writing style akin to Kerouac. The stream of consciousness prose is perfect for the experiences taking place. It helps to create that claustrophobic feeling that's so poignant in this book."}], "description": "This was no ordinary war. This was a war to make the world safe for democracy. And if democracy was made safe, then nothing else mattered--not the millions of dead bodies, nor the thousands of ruined lives... This is no ordinary novel. This is a novel that never takes the easy way out: it is shocking, violent, terrifying, horrible, uncompromising, brutal, remorseless and gruesome... but so is war.
