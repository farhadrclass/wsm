In this book we've also got a group of ghost hunters that are called to the Amador Hotel to check out some strange occurrences. As a fairly short book, it works to give you a few chills, but nothing too momentous.As I truly enjoy ghost stories, I was really curious about Amador Lockdown as soon as I read its brief, but eerie synopsis. We are right away introduced to four ghost hunter friends who call themselves the Paranormal Posse. Yes, very cheesy name, but they are an interesting dynamic group. Since the novel is short, there isn't an incredible amount of character development. It's more focused on the plot itself which is actually quite engaging. The writing format gives the book a really creepy vibe: While introducing the hauntings, it's told in interview style with the people who have witnessed unexplained events in this hotel. It's also intriguing that we get a few parts written in the ghosts' perspective. It's all very ominous. As having heard many haunting stories, the twists aren't incredibly unexpected, but they're entertaining nonetheless.If you enjoy ghost stories, Amador Lockdown is an eerie tale that you can easily read in one sitting. It's not especially deep or complex; it's a simple fun, mindless read.--For more of my reviews, visit my blog at \nXpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Katy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5552109-katy", "userReview": "Since I did the editing on this book, I feel uncomfortable rating it or writing a \"real\" review - however, I will say I very much enjoyed editing this book and learning about the characters. I'm also now curious about the ghost traditions of the TX/NM area and, if I had any extra time, I'd probably start doing mad research on it.

But I enjoyed it very much. We start with a group of paranormal investigators, The Paranormal Posse. Kind of a funny name, but if you\u2019ve ever seen any of the paranormal investigation shows on TV, you know most of them have a keen sense of humor. The Paranormal Posse specializes in investigations and also runs tours at different locations, allowing the public in on the investigating. At the beginning of the book we meet the team as they are on a tour. One of the lead guys, Hector, believes he is seeing shadows \u2013 ghosts! Fantastic, I think, we are into the action right off the bat. I love that. Marcos, another investigator in The Paranormal Posse, suggests that The Amador Hotel may be having paranormal problems. The team begins interviews with people who claim to have had paranormal experiences there. I really enjoyed the way the author used these experiences as a way to introduce some mini-stores into the book. Some of the interviews are rather tame ghost stories, but there is one from a boy named Julio that gave me chills! And while interviews begin, we get introduced to another twist. Hector\u2019s ex-wife is having trouble with their teenage son, Darren, and is signing custody over to Hector. Darren seems to be a teen that has an urge to rebel. It doesn\u2019t matter; of course, Hector is thrilled to have his son back. But not everything is as it seems. Darren is a handful, and there are some secrets his mother conveniently forgot to mention to Hector. And then we are also getting some glimpses into the paranormal realm. I liked the way the author handled these scenes. Not a lot of detail was given; things were kept fuzzy just like they were to the spirits. There is a definite creepy factor within these scenes that lends to the overall chill of the story. Soon enough interviews are over, and it\u2019s time to take on the physical investigation. Then the story really starts to get interesting. You think nothing is happening, but that is foolish to be so na\u00efve. Something is most definitely happening. Overall, I very much enjoyed this story. It had some definite twists and turns that were very interesting. The main character, Hector, was a kind man with a big heart. And when the unthinkable happens, he keeps his faith in what he knows to be true, not necessarily what everyone is telling him. There are some scenes near the end that I wish were a bit more detailed and longer, but only because I was enjoying them and wasn\u2019t ready for it to be over. I\u2019m not exactly sure how I feel about this book after it\u2019s over. The story is good, and the writing was good. Everything is good. But something happens, and I can\u2019t tell you exactly what (because any hint of telling you would be a spoiler). It was very unexpected, and not what I anticipated at all. I guess you will have to get ahold of this story and find out for yourself! I\u2019ve read a few ghost stories, and this one was different than most in the way that you are basically \u201cbehind the scenes\u201d of a paranormal investigation team for most of it. That in itself was a unique standpoint on a book. If you like good old fashioned ghost stories, then you are in for a treat with Amador Lockdown."}, {"userName": "Abigail", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6100497-abigail", "userReview": "What a pleasure this book was to read. A well written and down to earth ghost story. With everyone writing a new paranormal romance, mystery or urban fantasy novel these days, it is hard to find a good old fashioned ghost story. This one is set in a real hotel in El Paso. It opens in one of the most famous graveyards that I have also visited on a ghost story. From the first page this book felt comfortable, like I had slipped into my favorite sweats and curled up with my favorite tea cup under a warm comfy blanket. But it is not just a ghost story, it is a few stories rolled up into one. It is a story about loss and the search for what has been lost, from several different view points, not all of them earthly.I was rapidly turning each page with excitement! Amador Lockdown is a thriller in the real sense of the word! The story keeps you guessing and leaves you guessing till the very end. With such a classic style of ghost story it is refreshing that Ms. Russell was able to keep this mystery going with such consistency in style and also such capriciousness catching me off guard several times. I can honestly say I did NOT see any of it coming!It many ways it is also a story about loss. Loss of hope and loss of faith and the struggle to find them again, not just for Hector and his son, but for the spirits lost behind the veil. Many questions arose that were never answered including the one that I tend to always ask at the end of a ghost story, \u201cSo what happened to.....?\u201d We may never know! Coral was able to draw me in and developed her characters so strongly I was able to get a deep connection with them that makes me need and want to know. Which would be my only complaint. I want and I need to know more! I want the answers to the question, \"What happened to...?I have had my own share of ghostly encounters when I was living near Tombstone and Bisbee, AZ. Reading this just cements my beliefs more. The light happy fun of the Paranormal Posse to the dark sadness I felt with Hector's rage at those who did not believe him when he knew there was someone else that came back from that hotel lockdown, more then just his son )(that is if any of him was still left inside). It was so well written I felt the horror and anticipation right along with Hector, the fear that this child is truly lost forever, and I felt curiosity at who existed now. I hope we get some answers, only time and Coral's quill will tell!I would recommend this to anyone who likes a well written book about ghosts and real people. There is nothing fantastic or long legged in this book. It is about real people, their fascination with the paranormal and the relationships that exist in every day life."}, {"userName": "J.C.

The novel starts off as a pretty light story, despite the subject matter, with a group of paranormal investigators calling themselves \"the Paranormal Posse\" giving tours in a haunted graveyard and running investigations upon request of home owners and others who have experienced a fright. The team in the Posse have been working together for years, and the characters, despite their ghostly professions, are very grounded, real and likeable...and their dynamic with one another really works. Then things start getting weird...building to a \"lockdown\" in the historic Amador Hotel, a lockdown being when a team of ghost hunters spend the night in a haunted building and attempt to communicate with the resident spirits. I don't want to give anything away by saying too much, but dang, it gets pretty freaky after that! The ending wasn't at all predictable or what I expected...it was touching, upsetting, scary and very powerful. The relationship between one of the ghost hunters, Hector, and his son Darren really forms the heart of the book in a lot of ways.My only complaint really was that I wanted MORE. I actually could have read a longer book on this...there were a number of issues that I found myself wishing had been explored in more depth, including the history of the hotel, Darren's mysterious psychiatric ailments, the being at the end (I don't want to give anything away on that), and others I'm probably not remembering. All in all though, a great book! Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Books", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6665735-books", "userReview": "Gloriously spooky, this book follows the paranormal posse as they investigate the strange happenings at the Amador Hotel. No special powers here, just four people with an interest in ghosts and the paranormal in general. When Darren, a rebellious teenager who is said to be out of control, enters the situation, things get truly complicated. When I started reading \u201cAmador Lockdown\u201d, I thought it was going to be yet another ghost story. I soon realized how wrong I was when, a few chapters into the book, things started getting intense and spirit possession entered the picture - turning \"just scary\" into downright frightening! What really impressed me immensely about this book was that the author used realistic situations, existing technology and paranormal phenomena known to most people. This realistic touch continues throughout the book with characters who are the kinds of people we meet in day to day life. As the story is not very fast paced, it provides an almost unbearably slow build-up of tension to a truly hair- raising finale and an ending with an unexpected twist. Every chapter starts with a quote which hints at the contents thereof and what the reader can expect. This ensured my undivided attention and kept me reading.\u201cAmador Lockdown\u201d is a fast read which I easily finished in one evening \u2013 but disappointingly with a rather blunt ending for such a terrific book. I still highly recommend it for those who are looking for a good old-fashioned ghost story with a bit more to it and a moderately shocking ending.

I\u2019m a sucker for all of the paranormal TV shows, regardless how cheesy they get sometimes. I just can\u2019t resist a good spooky story. I\u2019m sure we have all heard something go Bump! in the night or a strange sound that sent chills down our spines as we secretly wondered what the heck it was, right? Well, Russell brings that creepy feel to life in Amador Lockdown.Russell starts off this creepy paranormal tale with the Paranormal Posse leading a tour group through an old graveyard, setting the tone for the entire story. As the team is called in to investigate, and hopefully debunk, the strange happenings at the Amador Hotel, it becomes quite clear that they may be in over their heads. Parts of the story had me thinking about Rose Red and a line about houses being alive and if we listen we can hear houses breathe\u2026this line is fitting for Amador Lockdown too.Overall, I enjoyed the riveting plot and the eery feel of the ghost hunt. The historical quality of the Amador Hotel was well researched, highlighting some of its unique history. Readers that enjoy Gretchen McNeil\u2019s Possess and Kendare Blakes\u2019s Anna Dressed in Blood will definitely find Amador Lockdown appealing.

I wanted to enjoy it and keep going, but I couldn't. Was the story horrible, no. I just couldn't see it through all the issues. The formatting problems on the Kindle version are very frustrating and easy to fix. The entire book is justified left, there are line spaces between each paragraph which spreads the book out and causes a lot of clicking/page turns, and there are many, many lines breaks where there shouldn't be.Also, I know this title was edited, but I think it needs a closer look. I found - FfundraiserMocha Frappe - why is that capitalized? Maybe if it said Starbucks Mocha Frappe and the drink is trademarked it should be capitalized. Ladies and Gentlemen, - again, gentlemen shouldn't be capitalized.Am I being picky? Maybe. But remember this - I have 400 other books waiting on my Kindle.

The Amador is an historical site and hotel that is experiencing irregularities which are now causing its bookings to suffer. Several events have been ruined by eye-witness accounts which have forced a skeptical admittance to the crew.The pace goes back and forth between the crew and the preliminary investigations and then proceeds onwards to the investigation of the hotel itself.

Unfortunately, I am also usually able to predict the ending before I'm halfway through most books. You've read the overview, and it takes nothing away from the suspense and unexpected ending that I found here. At points, Coral used points of wit and humor to push you through to the end.It is easy to \"know\" and identify with some of these characters just enough as you travel along with them on their journey, but not a lot of time is thrown into too much character description or development as is seen in many novels. However, there were a couple of characters I would have preferred to know better.Amador Lockdown is rather evenly paced and transitions decently throughout. The characters are likable, and the ending wasn't 100% expected which is a good thing.

Hector's partners understand that family comes first so they start the investigation of the Amador Hotel and the weird things that have been happening there. Fundraisers and events are being done to raise money to restore the building, during these events weird, unexplained things happen, which brings in the Paranormal Posse. There isn't a lot of character development with the rest of Hector's team or back story so you don't really get to know them that much, the good thing is that it doesn't take away from the book at all. It was very hard to put down once I started, the suspense of \"what's gonna happen next?\" and feeling some of the fear that the characters felt really pulled me in.

Whenever I have the inclination to be terrified I turn to South Korean and Japanese horror films which always leave me unnerved. It\u2019s a while since I read horror and I don\u2019t recall the last time I read a ghost story so I was intrigued by Amador Lockdown. The novel focuses on the Paranormal Posse \u2013 a quartet of friends that investigate the spooky and paranormal. At the outset they are giving a tour in an eerie graveyard but they go further afield when they are given an assignment at the Amador Hotel, full of history and supposedly haunted. The Posse head for the hotel for a lockdown to begin the hunt for ghosts.This is a fast-paced and short novel with little time to catch one\u2019s breath. Hector, Marcos, Bev and Tony make up the Paranormal Posse and they are a good bunch of characters to take our hand as we enter the Amador Hotel. There are numerous viewpoints including some fascinating interviews from people who have been to the hotel and witnessed strange events including a wedding celebration being disrupted. Something is lurking in the shadows of the hotel and it doesn\u2019t seem to suffer guests gladly. We soon get to the lockdown itself where the book\u2019s biggest chills can be found. Posse member Hector has had his plans somewhat disrupted by the arrival of his son, Darren, who he brings to the hotel in an attempt to re-establish a relationship. The question is do the Posse discover ghosts in the Amador Hotel or is it all a complete hoax?I enjoyed Amador Lockdown. It never stops to waste time in pondering insignificant things. Instead the story moves along at an electrifying pace and is hard to put down. I read 80% of this book in one day and would have finished it had I not started late in the day. There are few books I can say that about. The different viewpoints are fascinating including perspective of whatever is haunting the hotel. Russell builds the narrative up well to a very surprising conclusion. You\u2019ll think you\u2019ve got it sussed but then that final segment hits you and it hits hard. Completely unexpected. My only complaint is that the book is too short. It was over too quickly and I was left wanting more but that\u2019s the sign of a good writer though, right?Amador Lockdown is a quick but exciting ghost story. Although it won\u2019t take you long to get through the experience is a worthwhile one and the ending is well worth the wait."}, {"userName": "Home. Love.

I think people in general like the idea of people from the past sticking around, it's kind of a fun thing to think about and certainly can have plenty of uses in a book. That being said I am not a person who likes to be scared, so that was really my only concern when I was reading this book. However the book really isn't scary, more like suspenseful, which is something I really enjoy. Also the book isn't all that long so you don't have a lot of time to be scared. I also think the books length worked in its favor because it kept the suspenseful parts were I think more effective due to the length of the book. I have to say I am also impressed by the authors characters they created, they all have a pretty good rhythm to them and are pretty interesting. It impresses me because the books length could be a hinderance when trying to create fully fleshed out characters, but this author did not really have an issue at all with that. I think the biggest strength of this book is that it pulls you in. You want to know what happens next. I think the author did a good job with keeping the reader guessing about what was going to happen next, and then being able to hold on to that power until the very end. I also liked that the book felt more like watching an episode of a tv show, or a movie. I think the book used pretty good imagery and it made it all the more easy to picture what was going on in the book in my head. Which I enjoy. Overall, I think the book is pretty well written and it is a pretty enjoyable to read. I like that it took place in a hotel, I think it's a fun setting for a book. I think anyone who enjoys watching ghost hunter shows, or if you are at all interested in checking out something like that, then this is most certainly your book."}, {"userName": "Grampy", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7669867-grampy", "userReview": "\u201cAmador Lockdown\u201d by Coral Russell is a riveting tale of paranormal excellence. Hector and the Paranormal Posse (that is NOT the name of a rock band) were doing just fine with their public tours of allegedly haunted buildings in old El Paso, Texas. They even did the occasional \u201cghost hunting\u201d routine to prove or debunk rumored hauntings. When they decided to debunk the notion that Amador Hotel was haunted, they discovered a far darker \u201cother side\u201d than they ever expected to experience. On top of all the damage precipitated by unhappy spirits, Hector\u2019s son, Darren, whom he had only very recently taken into his home, disappeared. Hector\u2019s ex-wife, his parents, his friends, and even the police, all believed Darren had simply run away from Hector\u2019s home. When the police found and returned Darren to Hector\u2019s house, it seemed as if everybody else was right. But Hector could tell it was not Darren on the inside; another, more evil, spirit had taken control of Darren\u2019s body.\u201cAmador Lockdown\u201d is a highly enjoyable book. It is also very well written, and comes with a complex but easy-to-follow plot. The characters were very believable in every respect, and their interaction was precisely what you would expect. Darren\u2019s behavioral problems were also exactly what you might expect from a young teenager whose parents had divorced, and whose new Step-father was abusive. Coral Russell did some serious homework before writing this enticing tale. I fervently recommend \u201cAmador Lockdown\u201d to anybody and everybody who has an interest in haunted buildings, ghosts, or any other aspect of the paranormal. In a word \u2013 \u201cAmador Lockdown\u201d is awesome!"}, {"userName": "Jana Williams", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33146538-jana-williams", "userReview": "I Received the Book \"Amador Lockdown\" from the Author and I Told Her I Would be Happy to Review it When I Finished Reading it!

It starts in a cemetery that is suspected of being haunted with a group of paranormal investigators that call themselves the \"Paranormal Posse\". The Paranormal Posse give `ghost tours' for everyday people wanting to experience the paranormal. The real activity starts when they start to investigate and give an overnight tour at an old haunted hotel called the Amador.There are several layers to this story. There is the ghost activity, but there is a family crisis with one of the investigators. There is even a tragic surprise in the end. I don't want to give away the story, so I'll leave it at that.This is a novella length book and I feel it's very well written. If you like watching the tv shows where they hunt for ghosts, you will definitely like this book. It has all the suspense that you might expect. If you enjoy the suspense of ghost stories I think you will enjoy this book very much."}, {"userName": "S.M.

Here's my disclaimer - I am generally not a reader of ghost stories. That being said, Ms. Russell weaves a creepy tale that teaches me about the acoutrements of paranormal investigation, yanks me down a dark hallway, and leaves me, in the end, gasping in surprise.Hector's newly-formed and difficult relationship with his son hits dead on the mark, and I'm hoping to get to know the other members of the Paranormal Posse in Ms. Russell's future work.This is the second ghost story I've read by this author. She has a natural sense of story and plot, and I expect her narrative to become more and more sophisticated with every tale she pens!"}, {"userName": "Lesley McCullough", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5027149-lesley-mccullough", "userReview": "A hauntingly good paranormal ghost story holding the tension from start to finish. Although less than 100 pages in length it had plenty of content and good characters. Intriguing read leaving a desire for more ghost hunting adventures with the Paranormal Posse (the main protagonists). The relationship between father and son, the glimpse into the spirit world and the twist at the end create more depth to the narrative. If you like a good old fashioned ghost hunt then this is for you."}], "description": "FREE on every eBook platform.
