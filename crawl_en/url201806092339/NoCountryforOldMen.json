What better novel could I choose than this heartwarming tale of human kindness from one of the most optimistic men on the planet, Cormac McCarthy?** Note - That statement is sarcasm done in the interest of humor. 1000 reviews have taught me that I apparently have to explain that or someone with poor reading comprehension will troll me in the comments. In 1980 Llewellyn Moss is just a working Texan living in a trailer home with his young wife, Carla Jean. One day Llewellyn goes out hunting and comes home with a lot more than meat for the stew pot after he stumbles across the aftermath of a huge drug deal gone wrong in the desert. Over $2 million in a satchel would be hard for anyone to resist taking with no one around to know better, but giving into temptation unleashes hell in the form of Anton Chigurh, a relentless enforcer who removes any obstacles in his path with a cattle bolt gun and a silenced .12 gauge. Sheriff Ed Tom Bell is also on Llewellyn\u2019s trail, and he has to bear witness to the incredible violence unleashed by Chigurh and others. When Chigurh\u2019s actions grow too much for the men who sent him they hire the savvy Carson Wells to stop him and recover the money.An unsuspecting reader unfamiliar with the story or McCarthy\u2019s work might expect this to be simply a crime novel, and that\u2019s how a good chunk of the story plays at first. Llewellyn may seem like your average good-ole-boy, but he\u2019s also a Vietnam vet who shows a fair amount of caution and smarts even when he\u2019s forced to go on the run. He\u2019s clear eyed enough to know that once he\u2019s taken the money that there\u2019s no going back, and he\u2019s actually got some good survival instincts for this kind of thing. However, for all the determination and capability he shows, and even knowing that he\u2019s put himself in the crosshairs of very dangerous people by taking the money, Llewellyn doesn\u2019t truly understand what he\u2019s gotten himself into. The actions of those involved in the drug trade at that level have created an ocean of evil and chaos. The satchel full of money is just a bit of debris that washed up on shore that Llewellyn found like a piece of driftwood that he thinks he can scamper off with, and he\u2019ll be fine as long as he stays off the beaches. However, something else lurks in those depths. Maybe it\u2019s something new or maybe it\u2019s something ancient that was awakened by all the noise around it, but this creature won\u2019t stop at the water\u2019s edge. Anton Chigurh strides out of that ocean on two legs but still fully capable of devouring anything in his path with no more thought than a shark gives any fish it chomps. He can swim or run, it makes no real difference to him as long as he gets to eat. Sheriff Bell has been aware of existence of men like Chigurh, and he\u2019s not sure how to stop them or even if they can be fought. Take a boat out on the those waters and you\u2019ll probably get dragged down into the depths with them. Battle them on the shores and you\u2019re still likely to get pulled in and chewed up. What really worries Bell is that it seems like water is rising, and a lot of people seem willing to dive in so he's pretty well convinced that the entire world is sliding into hell.That\u2019s why I consider this a next level book. The idea of a guy finding a bag of money and getting bad people on his trail has been done before. The characters also could be cliches. The regular guy with a tough streak, the bad ass pursuing him, the honest law man, the worried wife, the roguish hustler looking for an angle, etc etc. McCarthy is good and sneaky enough to let that play to the point where you think that you know how the story will end, and that\u2019s when he pulls the rug out from under you. It\u2019s also where the book really shifts from what seems like a straightforward thriller to a brooding contemplation about fate vs. free will as well as good vs. evil.I could make some complaints about that might ordinarily knock it down from 5 to 4 stars for me. McCarthy\u2019s style of doing a minimum of punctuation so that quotation marks aren\u2019t used and apostrophes are seldom seem can cause confusion and often seems like a distracting affectation, but on the other hand this is a book about the normal rules not applying so it does seem to work in a way. The story also seems to be littered with anachronisms for 1980. There\u2019s a mobile phone capable of fitting in a shirt pocket at a time when a cell phone was essentially a bag, and while ATMs existed I don\u2019t know if they would have been common in south Texas at the time. A Glock pistol is mentioned, but they wouldn\u2019t exist for at least another year or two. Plus, I\u2019m no gun expert, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s actually possible to silence a shotgun.Despite that nitpicking this book hits an intersection of things I love. It\u2019s a fusion of genres that draws on crime stories and westerns, but it ultimately becomes Very Serious Lit-A-Chur that\u2019s done in a minimalist way that works very well for me. I\u2019m also a deeply cynical person who agrees with McCarthy\u2019s dim view of the world so I appreciate a story that isn\u2019t blinding rainbows and unicorn farts. It also has the advantage of being turned into the fantastic flm by the Coen brothers which is one of my favorite book-to-screen adaptations. So I\u2019ll stick with the 5 stars and consider it among the best of the best.Since this #1000, I\u2019ll also provide a little bonus content. The violence associated with the drug trade in Mexico and it\u2019s creep into the US has sparked a lot of great fiction that can be genuinely chilling in it\u2019s depiction of the way it can corrupt and utterly destroy people. If you\u2019re into that sort of thing I also recommend:- The film The Counselor was also written Cormac McCarthy. It isn\u2019t nearly at the level of this one, but I do think it was unfairly savaged by critics. It\u2019s not great, but it is good and shares similarities. You\u2019ll also never look at Cameron Diaz in quite the same way again.- Writer Don Winslow has been researching the history of the drug trade on the American/Mexican border for years, and he has two fantastic books that are essentially historical fiction that shine a lot on how US policies helped create that monster in The Power of the Dog and The Cartel. His Savages is also a black action comedy about people who think they can just dip their hands into that flow for profit and not get sucked into it. They are wrong.- Sicario is a great and criminally overlooked film from last year that features a haunting performance by Benicio del Toro. It should also come with a warning label to abandon all hope before watching.Thanks to all those who voted and commented without being a trollish asshat on my first 1000 reviews. It's genuinely appreciated, and I hope that you now all know better than to try and keep a bag of drug money you find in the desert."}, {"userName": "Glenn Russell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23385697-glenn-russell", "userReview": "\u201cHow does a man decide in what order to abandon his life?\u201d\u2015 Cormac McCarthy, No Country For Old MenMy first contact with this work of fiction was listening to a 'Partially Examined Life' podcast with 3 young philosophers and Eric Petrie, a university professor who has made a study of Cormac McCarthy's dark novel set in Texas in 1980. This fascinating discussion motivated me not only to read the book but listen to the audiobook read by Tom Stechschulte. I'm glad I did. Stechschute's reading is spot-on, particularly his portrayal of one of the main characters, a good old boy by the name of Sherriff Bell.Since there are many reviews posted, in the spirit of freshness, I'd like to share a few reflections of a philosophical nature. My observations are in light of what contemporary British philosopher Simon May has to say about the nature of love. According to May, love isn't what philosophers like Plato say it is, that is, love being a longing for the Good and Beautiful; rather, May argues love has a wider range: we fall in love inspired by an anchoring for our life, an anchoring giving us a home in the world. Such a love is worth dying for, since we want so much to be rooted in the world with a feeling of being fully alive.So, keeping Simon May's idea of love in mind, let's take a look at McCarthy's novel. An entire essay could be written for each main character, but, in the interest of concision, I'll limit my remarks to a few sentences on each man's way of living and loving:Llewelyn Moss is a 37 year old welder who served as a army sniper in Viet Nam. Moss is out in the desert with his sniper rifle hunting game when he sees something unusual off in the distance--- a bunch of cars and trucks appearing to have been abandoned. He walks down to have a closer look and finds the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad - men and even dogs filled with bullets and covered with blood. Moss then comes across a briefcase filled with $100 bills. He takes the money and knows this is the moment his life will be changed forever. Why would he do such a thing? I see one big reason Moss would take the money: by so doing he will be skyrocketed into a world where the intensity of being alive is a thousand times greater than being a welder. Having had an experience of life-and-death intensity in Viet Nam, Moss knows the feeling well.Anton Chigurh, also a Viet Nam veteran, is the man from the drug world who comes after Moss. As we follow Chigurh in the story, it quickly becomes clear he sees himself as a grim-reaper -- anybody who stands before him, if he so chooses, has come face-to-face with their own death. Well, not exactly his choice alone. Chigurh will occasionally flip a coin and ask the person to call it. If anybody shows the least hesitation to face their own choices in life or the reality of their own death, then, well, by Chigurh's standards, they might as well be dead. We would have to go a long way to find a character in literature, perhaps Richard III, who is equally the embodiment of pure evil. Love? Chigurh loves death; he is a true necrophilia, and he shares his love whenever the occasion presents itself. In the course of this McCarthy novel, Chigurh kills men and women left and right.Sheriff Bell is a World War II veteran who sees his county losing its moral glue. And moral glue anchors Sherriff Bell's life and gives him a home in the world. He reflects toward the end of the story, \"These old people I talk to, if you could of told em that there would be people on the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses speakin a language they couldnt even understand, well, they just flat out wouldnt of believed you. But what if you'd of told em it was their own grandchildren?\" We also learn what especially anchors Bell's life (what Bell loves) is a prime military virtue: loyalty to your men. And Bell tells his old uncle about the major regret of his life -- when a Sergeant in the war he faced a choice: stick with his men or save his own life. Since at one point in a battle the overwhelming odds were that all of his men were dead, he made the choice to save himself by leaving. Bell says he has been reflecting on this event over the years and concludes he violated the code of loyalty. He goes on to say that if he had to do it over again, he would have died with his men rather than leaving.These observations about the nature of love are made as a kind of invitation to read McCarthy's novel and see where you stand philosophically. Is love only love for the Beautiful and Good, or can love have, as Simon May puts forth (and illustrated by the respective objects of love of these 3 men), a more expansive and darker range?

This was an important moment for me not only because he is the author of Blood Meridian, No Country For Old Men and The Road, all books I worship, but also because McCarthy is famous for his almost Salinger-like reclusive tendencies. He does not do interviews nor does he show up on The Tonight Show. He doesn't walk red carpets, tour colleges on the lecture circuit, or do any of the public events that come with being one of the nation's greatest prose stylists.He writes these remarkable, beautiful, elegiac tragedies, steeped in prose that at times become Biblical in their sweep and intensity. Then he stays utterly quiet about them. (With few exceptions \u2013 he did a New York Times interview in 1992 and sat down with Oprah Winfrey last June.)I saw him at the Oscars on Sunday, just a face in the crowd gathered in the three-story lobby of the Kodak Theatre before the show, where champagne flutes were being clinked by the beautiful horde in anticipation of the big night.Of course, the Coen brothers' adaptation of No Country For Old Men was up for many of the top prizes, and that is why McCarthy was making this rare public appearance. At first, I wasn't sure it was really him, and then I lost sight of him. A female voice over the sound system announced that there were 45 minutes before the start of the telecast. Soon after that, he vanished.My job on this night is to be a reporter covering the backstage area, trying to capture true behind-the-scenes stories that no one sees. After cruising around a bit, talking with host Jon Stewart, making sure I didn't miss Jack Nicholson's annual pass-through (last year he showed up with a shaved head) I ducked into the main hall of the theater. I am one of the few reporters with a pass that opens pretty much all doors. I spend most of the night in the wings of the stage, catching candid moments from the winners and presenters, chatting with the folks I know or have interviewed before, gathering the backstory for USA Today's Oscar lead the next day.The theater was mostly empty. A few dozen seat-fillers were lined up along one side of the theater, getting instructions for the night, and some crew guys were checking the camera rigs near the foot of the stage.McCarthy was sitting by himself, alongside his young son, John, (the inspiration, incidentally, for The Road) about four rows from the front, with no one else around. One crew member walked by and shook his hand, and the author seemed genuinely pleased to chat. On one hand I thought I should leave him be. He is famously press-averse, as I said, and I didn't see any value in trying to disturb him. My job is to do interviews, to gather anecdotes from the scene, but if someone doesn't want to talk, I try not to hassle. The New York Times, in its interview 15 years ago, described him as a \"gregarious recluse\" who \"has lots of friends who know that he likes to be left alone.\"On the other hand, when you are at these events as a reporter, you are also constantly aware of your status as an outsider. Not only that, but when you come from a little town outside of Pittsburgh and find yourself in the glittering swirl of a setting such as the Academy Awards, you can't help but have a little pang of squirming desperation. It's easy to feel lonely in these crowds.McCarthy's charming reaction to the crew worker who recognized him suggested he was not shy or hostile. I don't think this Pulitzer-winning author needed company from the likes of me, but he is a human being \u2013 and one I admire \u2013 so I decided to just put away the notebook and take a chance on saying hello.I approached respectfully and said that I was a reporter, but not one who wanted to interview him. He smiled, stood up and shook my hand. \"What's your name?\" he asked, and I told him. \"Bresnihan?\" he asked. \"Is that Irish?\"\"No, it's Slovak,\" I told him. \"Breznican,\" he repeated. \"How is that spelled?\"Momentarily unable to remember the letter order of my own name, I looked at my credential. He said isn't it interesting how it could sound so much like the Irish name Bresnihan and yet be from somewhere so far away? I agreed that was a funny coincidence.\"Is this your son?\" I asked, leaning over to wave at the little boy. He reminded me of the little kid from There Will Be Blood \u2013 a round head with neatly combed hair and wise little eyes.\"This is John \u2026 John, this is Anthony,\" McCarthy said, and I shook the kid's hand. He had a big smile on his face. McCarthy asked me what paper I was writing for, and I told him, gesturing back to the stage where I would spend most of the night, describing my duties in brief.Then I told him that I just wanted to shake his hand, to thank him for all the remarkable work, and wish the both of them an enjoyable evening. He said, \"It should be fun. It should be trippy,\" and we both laughed.He seemed pretty relaxed, and that was such a great line -- very unexpected. So I took another chance and said, \"You know, I am writing about the scene here tonight, and \u2026 if you didn't mind, could I quote you? Could I get your thoughts on all this?\" If he'd said no, that he'd rather not, that would have been fine. I tried not to put the pressure on. I know the guy's reputation. Showing up at Thomas Pynchon's door is not going to persuade him to pose for a snapshot, you know?But McCarthy didn't balk. He looked around and waved one arm from the stage to the lobby. \"What's there to say \u2014 I'm at the Oscars and I'm not even in the film business!\" He said again that he thought it would be fun, and \u2013 knowing how stressed all the nominees have been \u2013 I said, yeah, it should.After all the snark and cynicism of Hollywood, it was a relief to hear some pure cheerfulness for a change. I'm grateful he didn't shoo me away, and hope he doesn't regret chatting (or me describing the encounter here.)I told him the thing that surprised me the most about the film was how similar the scenes in the movie seemed to the book, that the way I had pictured certain sequences were almost exactly as they appeared in the film \u2013 which means the Coens must have followed even the most subtle of descriptions from the novel.McCarthy said, \"Well, you can never put a whole book on the screen,\" but said he admired the movie they made from it.\"They got the heart of it,\" I told him, and he nodded, saying that he was surprised anyone wanted to make the movie at all, since the book has such an unusual ending. \"I'm just glad people didn't run screaming from the theater,\" he said, chuckling. I said it was the best kind of ending: one that gives you something to talk about later.With that, I decided to cut these two fellows loose. I could have stood there and talked to him from then until the end of the three-and-a-half hour show, grilling him about his stories, hearing the greater writer's thoughts on his work. That, he really would have hated. And I knew that was never going to happen anyway.I wished them both a good evening, and waved good-bye. Part of me wondered if it had not been a missed opportunity. So few people get to encounter him, should I not have gathered some thought or nugget from him, some insight into the mind that has so eloquently pondered the violent and cruel tendencies of our species? Where are we headed? Why are we this way? What's next? Where did these tales originate in his synapses?But that's heavy business, and interesting to me, but probably not to him. Surely he would have hated it \u2013 and has said so in the past. I decided beforehand that I wasn't going to talk to the great author, I was going to talk to a guy I respected. I only rolled the dice and asked to quote him because he ultimately did seem so friendly and happy to be there, and it seemed okay to ask. For someone whose writing explores our darkest natures, I enjoyed the opportunity to share an exchange about a happy moment. McCarthy doesn't attend events that are held in his honor, and yet here he was at the Oscars \u2013 and he was the first one standing and clapping in honor of the Coens when they won best picture.Just meeting the man was a treat. Glen Hansard, the actor-singer from Once who won the best song trophy that night, told me that when he met Bob Dylan, he told Dylan: \"This means as much to me as when you met Woody,\" referring to the iconic folk singer Woody Guthrie. I don't pretend to be on that level, but as a writer getting to meet McCarthy, there was nothing better for me that night, despite all the other famous folks around.My brief, light encounter reminded me in some ways of Allen Ginsberg, describing in his poem Death News the time he and Jack Kerouac and some of the other Beats met William Carlos Williams and \"inquired wise words.\" W.C.W. looked out his window and said, \"There's a lot of bastards out there\u2026\"My exchange was much more lighthearted, but no less surprising. I might have expected McCarthy to be grim, more stone-faced than he was, or to find him brutally uncomfortable with conversation. As it turned out, he was very warm and kind, surprisingly so \u2026 And I enjoyed meeting his little boy and seeing a father and son sharing a fun night out. McCarthy and I didn't exchange any secrets of life, but we exchanged pleasantries. In a world where cruelty is too often the top commodity, that's something, at least. I hope he felt the same.(UPDATE: I'm an author myself now, and my novel \"Brutal Youth\" comes out in June 2014. If you liked this story, maybe you'll be interested in finding me here on Goodreads.)"}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "Coac McCartney's No Country for Old Men is a quick but intense read. For those that saw the Cohen brothers' movie first (as I did years ago), the book is as bleak and violent as the movie was. Chigurh is probably up there with The Joker as one of the most evil, conscience-free bad guys in literature. He kills willfully and without a shred of remorse before slinking back into the woodwork unseen and uncaught. Moss is a tragic, but heroic character who gets caught up with something far beyond his abilities (which are great to say the least) to control. Bell is precisely how he was portrayed in the film: tired, old, jaded. The writing is typically devoid of quotation marks but full of wonderful descriptions:\"It was a big redtail...Any small thing might venture to cross. Closing in on the prey against the sun. Shadowless. Lost in the concentration of the hunter.\" (P. 45). This attention of Bell for the dead hawk mirrors his attention to the various victims of the cartel and Chigurh.\"Anything can be an instrument, Chigurh said. Small things. Things you wouldn't even notice. They pass from hand to hand. People don't pay attention. And then one day there's an accounting. And after that nothing is the same.\" (P. 57). This is sort of the leitmotif of the entire novel. Nothing is ever the same. Moss and the hitchhiker: \"What do I gotta do for it?You don't gotta do nothin. Even a blind sow finds a acorn ever once in a while.\" (P. 233)Moss never asks for help and yet throws himself into what he knows is a deadend quest - for a goal he is not even aware of, other than knowing that he will never reach it.The last time we see Chigurh with Carla Jean, he again leaves her fate to the toss of a coin:\"I only have one way to live. It doesn't allow for special cases. A coin toss perhaps. In this case to small purpose. Most people believe there cannot be such a person. You can see what a problem that must be for them. How to prevail over that which you refuse to acknowledge the existence of.\" (P. 260)As in most of McCarthy's novels, there is not really a moral to be found here. There is inescapable evil in the world and at some point you place yourself on one side or the other. When you straddle the line as Moss did, things usually do not come out well. Nonetheless, it is powerful reading and of course was made into an epic film.

Like Judge Holden and Glanton in Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West, Chigurh is intelligent, resourceful and utterly devoted to violence and chaos. Yet, like the antagonists in Blood Meridian, McCarthy has imbued in Chigurh a strange integrity, a devotion to a natural order that I think is McCarthy's embodied illustration of evil - a man cut off and separated from the love of man or God. McCarthy's lean, muscular narrative style is in masterful form for this dialogue on good and evil, and like other McCarthy novels, he pays no mind to popular ideals of what a story should say or do. McCarthy is the quintessential post-modernist with his bold disregard for traditional plot structure and unsettling d\u00e9nouement. There is no warm and fuzzy Hollywood ending here, no cathartic summation.

The novel grows on you.No Country for Old Men starts out in a thoroughly disjointed way. Multiple POVs, total lack of punctuation, dialogue rendered exactly as the characters speak it... the reader is utterly confused as to where the focus is, who the protagonist is, and what the story is about. It could be about one Llewlyn Moss who stumbles upon a fortune while hunting antelope near the Rio Grande. A transaction between drug dealers has gone wrong, leaving a number of bodies, a huge stash of heroin, and a case full of cash. Moss takes the cash and runs, knowing fully well that his life is changed for ever.Or then, it could be about Anton Chigurh, hired gun and cold-blooded killing machine. He is entrusted with the task of finding the money taken by Moss. On the way, Chigurh leaves a trail of dead bodies, sometimes philosophising to his victims.Or it could be about Sheriff Bell, bent on doing his job of keeping law and order and protecting the citizens of his county to the best of his ability-even though most of the time, he fails.The story moves at a roller-coaster pace. The scenes are short and mostly disjointed: the author sometimes leaves a major piece of the action behind the scenes. Characters come and go without any introduction. The sentences hit you like machine-gun fire.If you stick with the novel, after some time, you get accustomed to the style; it loses its annoyance potential, and the real story starts coming through.For this is not the story of Moss, or of Anton Chigurh; but of Sheriff Bell, and the country he is a symbol of. This is the country of Daniel Boone and Wyatt Earp and Billy the Kidd and Jesse James: the country of \"The Man With No Name\", and a hundred Spaghetti Westerns we have seen and forgotten. This country is absolutely heartless but imbued with a certain terrible beauty. This country sends forth its sons to die in Vietnam and Iraq.It is, indeed, not a country for old men.Anton Chigurh is a masterly creation: one of the most frightening villains I have come across, because he is not \"evil\" in the traditional sense. Chigurh is a philosopher, a believer in the karma of what he is doing, the karma which is unstoppable and which will find you out no matter what. The scenes of him philosophising with Carson Wells and Carla Jean before he shoots them are terrifying for the lack of emotion in them. It is also ironical that an out-of-control car driven by three junkies, an entirely chance event, ultimately proves to be his undoing.But as I said earlier, this is the story of Sheriff Bell, who is atoning for a single act of cowardice during the second world war (rather like Lord Jim). We get to know this only towards the very end, after the whole affair of Moss and Chigurh is over and done with: then the story suddenly falls into focus, and the philosophical interludes of the sheriff interspersed throughout the novel with the main narrative starts to make perfect sense. The killers, the chase and the shootouts are all just window dressing for the story of this one man as he tries to make sense of the conundrum of the meaning of life. And he does find his answer, though maybe not the one he expected.The image of this man, standing alone in the midst of the desert, shoulders slumped in defeat against an increasingly violent and unjust world, is a touching one: and somehow heartening. Because we know that he is the real spirit of the desert, the gunslinger of American myth who rides off into the sunset after taking care of the baddies. And because we know that finally at the end of the trail, his dad will be waiting for him with the fire burning in the dark as he saw in his dream.Ride on, Sheriff Bell."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "4.5 to 5.0 stars. First, a pre-emptive apology...this is my first Cormac McCarthy novel and so my gush of praise may be a tad too CAPTAIN KIRKISH in its melodramatic over the top-ness, so please forgive me. I will attempt to keep my giddiness to a minimum...but man can this guy write a novel!!! I will start by saying without trying to sound overly stuffy or pretentious that I thought this was a brilliant, nuanced, multi-layered story that was told in extremely simple, straight-forward prose yet required the reader to sift through the dialogue and pull out the deeper meaning that McCarthy was trying to convey. Or, put another way...THIS BOOK WAS FULL OF ENOUGH WIN TO PUSH IT UP INTO UBER TERRITORY.\nI have a read quite a few books in my life with a large portion of them being read over the last five years when I have been old enough (hopefully) to more fully appreciate some of the \u201cclassics\u201d that I was forced to read in high school and as an undergrad (in between a lot of science fiction, fantasy and thrillers). I have loved quite a few of the books and have a pretty healthy bookshelf of \u201cAll Time Favorites\u201d and \u201c6 star books.\u201d However, for all of the books that I have loved, there are only a handful that have actually either changed the way I think or given me a deeper insight into my world and my history. These I would call my \"life-changers\" and comprise a fairly eclectic group:Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass and John Adams (both inspirational figures who demonstrate greatness to me); American Psycho (the loss of empathy and consequent brutality resulting from the isolation, shallowness and loss of true identity that resulted from the rampant consumerism of the 80\u2019s); The Old Man and the Sea (the power and beauty to be found in a man\u2019s simple determination to persevere and not give up); The Sparrow (a superb story that illustrates the battle a good person can have with their faith when they are faced with the question \u201cHow could a loving God allow such evil and pain to happen to good people?); The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas (the Short Story) (the most evocative and powerful rebuttal to the utilitarian theory of ethics I have ever read...it still gives me chills when I read it); Night (the stark reality of man's inhumanity to man is something I will never forget);Lost Boys (the short story) by Orson Scott Card; (as a parent, this was the most devastatingly emotional piece of literature I have ever read).To that list I now add this amazing book which if I was annotating it like the stories above I would say: the most concise, piercing and spot on description of the rapid, cataclysmic escalation of violence in America beginning at the start of the 1980\u2018s and the absolute inability of the previous generation of leaders (in all areas of life from education, to spiritual, to law enforcement) to respond to, cope with (or even understand) the new breed of criminal that arose during that time. I would also say that the fact that the reader (i.e., a regular person of today) is not as shocked or confused by the actions of people like Anton Chigurh as Sheriff Bell is in the book is a powerful statement about how numb and accepting we have become of brutal, sadistic violence being a part of our everyday lives. I thought the book was superb and I look forward to reading more by McCarthy very soon. OH, and I can not end this review without saying that ANTON CHIGURH is one of the most COMPELLING, DISTURBING AND AMAZING literary characters I have come across in a long while. I was riveted to the story every single time he was anywhere near the narrative.

Vietnam vet Llewelyn Moss isn't making things any easier. Moss happened upon the drug deal aftermath, grabbed the loot and dashed. Chigurh's been on his heels ever since.

There are a multitude of colorful and carefully crafted characters herein, some as thorny as the landscape. How do I know the landscape is thorny? Cormac McCarthy made me feel it. The book is set in 1980. Thankfully, McCarthy doesn't overplay it with product placement...Oh look at me in my Lee jeans and pornstar mustache drinking from a glass bottle of Coke while sitting on the hood of my '76 Camaro....He uses period-appropriate props only when they are necessary. The plot is tight when it needs to be and breathes when it can. The action fluctuates from relaxed to tense and back again. Not-completely-necessary-but-still-enjoyable story asides (that you won't find in the movie) often contain pearls of homespun wisdom like \"Every step you take is forever. You can't make it go away. None of it.\"I saw the movie version of this awhile back and, although the book and movie are very similar, this was still an exciting read for me. McCarthy's austere style may not set well with all readers - he doesn't fuck around with flowery words much - however, the spartan prose marches soldierly ahead, pressing the story on, delivering to the reader a tale victoriously told."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "NO COUNTRY FOR OLD REVIEWERSRayner took the bolt of the Uzi and slid the firing pin on.

You could've just as well filmed the pages being flicked through (preferably by Javier Bardem, I'm sure he'd do it astoundingly) and you'd get roughly the same experience. I understand the comparisons being made between the film and the book. That's the kind of understanding guy I am. I can only say both are masterpieces. It all starts with Cormac McCarthy though, and while the Coen brothers and the cast of the movie did a tremendous job, I think the biggest piece of the praisecake should go to the author. This book has many things that define good books: 1. Suspense: Danger looms everywhere as soon as that suitcase gets in the picture. You can feel it breathing down the neck of everyone who comes near it. The main personificiation of this danger, Anton Chigurh, is one of the most legendary villains I've come across. Cold, rational, in control. 2. Pacing: While this is a book where you wonder what will happen next, it doesn't give you much time for doing that. Because while you're wondering BOOM, there's a surprise for you. BAM, there's another one. WHOOSH, still didn't see that coming, did you? Chigurh moves faster than your fears do.3. Characters: Bell, the good. Chigurh, the bad. And everyone else gloriously in between, with their little views and wisdoms.Speaking of wisdoms: The Bell-monologues are what really gave this book the extra touch for me. His fondness for his wife Loretta is the strongest counterweight to Chigurh. There are things that Bell possesses that Chigurh can never put a hole in. Reading those monologues is like listening to your grandfather, full of wisdoms that seem so commonplace to the person uttering them that it becomes touching, especially in contrast with what's really going on in the world that has gone and changed around them.

They are the same book, I thought, No Country For Old Men and the Bible. Only one is more graphic than the other. You have to use your imagination when reading the Bible. McCarthy fills in the cracks, takes away your imagination. That\u2019s all.I read a story in the Bible about a woman who lived with a large group of people, and a man from another tribe came in and raped her. After that God's people came in and killed every one of this man's people. Men, women, and children. Sounds like McCarthy. It was okay for the Israelites to do this, because, well, they were God's people.  McCarthy would have just made that scene more real. You would see the woman raped, her people\u2019s blood would be poring out on the streets, they would be crying, screaming. Things like that.The man in McCarthy\u2019s book does the same thing, kills innocent people. He is a psychopathic killer. I am reading another book along with it, Behave: The Biology of Humans at Our Best and Worst by Sapolsky who is a professor of biology and neurology. He was once a neuroendocrinologist.He wrote about the psychopath: , \u201cPsychopaths are typically poor at recognizing fearful expressions (though they accurately recognize other types). They also look less at the eyes than normal and improve at fear recognitions when directed to focus on the eyes.\u201d Still he says, they are emotionless, remorseless, and have a reptilian indifference.Did God look into the eyes of those He had killed? If He did. did he feel anything? I am only asking.And then I found other Bible lessons in McCarthy\u2019s book, but I would have to go into what was happening by beginning at the start. The main character in this book is Moss. Moss lives in a Texas desert town and hunts antelopes. He was out hunting for antelopes on this fateful day, but instead of killing an antelope, he hunted up trouble. He got out his binoculars and scratched around the land for antelopes, finding instead three vehicles with dead bodies lying around on the ground. Remember Lot\u2019s wife in the Bible? She was told by an angel of God to not look back or else. Moss looked back instead of running from the scene. He couldn\u2019t help himself, just like Lot\u2019s wife. Moss went down to check out the bodies\u2019 one too many times. The first was fatal; the second was just dumb. But I am not saying that he died in the story; just saying. One man was still alive and asked for water, just like the man in hell in the New Testament. When He asked for water; God didn\u2019t listen. Maybe He didn\u2019t even look into his eyes to know his suffering. Maybe his ears were closed. I don\u2019t know. Moss, on the other hand didn\u2019t have any water to give. Then Moss checked out the trucks, found heroin. He left the heroin where it was and walked down a bloody path where he found another dead man--and money. Anyway, he took the money, went back to his truck and home to his wife. I thought then that his wife was now good as dead. She should have left him when he told her about the money. Maybe she should have left him long ago. Life is like that, sometimes you get only one window of opportunity. Moss leaves his wife at home and decides to check out the scene again, but by this time it doesn\u2019t matter; its too late for other reasons.  To me, this book was just another bloody Bible lesson, but a much more interesting story."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "[\n\n(hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Dan Schwent", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/870755-dan-schwent", "userReview": "While out shooting antelope, Llewellyn Moss stumbles upon a crime scene: three trucks, all shot up, and numerous bodies.

Can Moss survive long enough to enjoy the money?This was my first McCarthy book and probably won't be the last. I devoured it in a single sitting. The clipped style really drove the story forward, reminding me of Jim Thompson at times and Flannery O'Connor at others. The tension grows as Moss and Chigurh head toward the climax. Sheriff Bell does his best to piece things together and keep more people from dying. A recurring theme through the novel is choices, how one's choices make them who they are.I wanted to give this five stars but I couldn't for two reasons. The primary reason: What was with the lack of quotation marks and apostrophes? Was McCarthy's keyboard defective? A little dialogue attribution would have been nice, particularly in the later chapters with Moss talking to other characters. The other gripe is that the last fifty or sixty pages didn't live up to the promise of the rest of the book. I don't want to spoil things but a pretty important character dies like a chump and does it off screen, making the previous 200+ pages seem like a bit of a waste.All in all, No Country for Old Men was a good read, especially for those who like a good pulpy crime story.

But the one thing I cannot accept is when people say he only writes westerns. His books cannot be categorized with such a simple claim. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a perfect example. Sure, McCarthy uses some sterotypes (easy-going sheriff, bumbling hero, and creepy psychopath) to tell his story, but he uses them in ways that few writers can--McCarthy breaths life into his characters, gives them substance. He paints with his words a world fully realized; even with a sparse writing style (in most of his books) readers are subjected to a canvas that is multilayered, complex, and unique. If you've seen the Coen brothers movie of this novel you already know how creepy Anton Chigurh is; the book paints him much creepier. In a nutshell: if this is just a western where a man comes across some loot that doesn't belong to him, and then more men want what he has and they send a very bad dude after the man with the loot, then THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is just a story about an old guy fishing.

And you know what that tells you? Not shit, except that the man can basically do no wrong in my eyes. I can and will nitpick, but just know that I don't really mean it and it's only because I love you, baby.First thing's first: I saw this movie about a zillion times before I read the book, though I wish, I wish, I wish that I hadn't. When an author bases a novel's emotional heft largely on the momentum of its action, suspense, and general thrills!, verily it doth suck when you know exactly where all that bing-bang-boom is headed. I am willing to acknowledge that it is unfair of me to judge the book based on this external factor. However, The Road was unaffected by my pre-read film viewing, and so I cast one stone. Okay, so No Country is not as excellent as The Road. Again, not saying much.Second thaaang: Unlike in that one book I just mentioned, the staccato style did occasionally get to me. I like to think of it as a warm-up exercise (since practice makes perfect and all), but still I found it to be excessively clipped and jarring in some places. Here and there, it was basically like this: \"Moss needed to piss. He found a wall. He unzipped his Wranglers. He pulled out his penis. Moss urinated. The wall got wet. Moss felt relieved. So long, penis.\" Still, it's Cormac McCarthy; the bulk of the novel is putrid elegance. Expect no less.Third: McCarthy is a craftmaster at evoking vivid landscapes. Added to his skill at articulating scenic minutia, I was actually (just like Moss and his buddy, Chigurh) traveling by car, train, and foot in Texas as I read, completed, and proceeded to mull over this book. I felt the oppressive heat, witnessed the sprawling golden fields, and raced past the rotting roadside dives as McCarthy tromped through them in text. It is eerie-cool to feel double-whammied by a book like that, and so I think I will make a point of being similarly literal again some time in the near future. I'll try not to take it so far that I'm like some asshole who reads Under the Tuscan Sun on vacation in Italy right after a breakup, but ya know...something like that. I wonder if astronauts read sci-fi novels in space?Fourth and final point: I much prefer the fiery britches Carla Jean. That woman didn't actually quite take things lying down like a frightened and battered puppy. Her extended scene with Chigurh was quite telling, as was her Bonnie and Clyde-like resistance to Sheriff Bell's interrogation concerning Moss's whereabouts. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that despite the script's relative accuracy, there are some surprises yet as far as she, Chigurh, and Moss are concerned (to summarize, the latter has a long scene with a character who didn't make the cut for the screenplay, but who reveals a lot about Moss through her interactions with him). The book still has some stories to tell. It isn't all an echo.Anyway, read this book. Why? It's McCarthy, dude.

Sheer menace and danger epitomizes this man, if ever the dialogue contained in a book could put you walking on the precipice of a perilous encounter, this is it. The only character that comes close to this is Preacher Jack Collins from James Lee Burke's Rain Gods and is narrated by the same man.The audio highlights the threat this character portrays, the conversation between Chigurh and the store owner at the beginning of the story, over the toss of a coin is just disturbing, incredibly tense and your attention is riveted, as is the scene with Wells the second hitman, taut with not a waver in sight.Finally his conversation with the young woman and wife of Llewelyn Moss, something he doesn't have to do but something his own morally disquieting fucking code won't allow him not to do. And once more, all on the toss of a coin, life or death.'Every moment in your life is a turning and every one a choosing. Somewhere you made a choice. All followed to this.

Several men and a number of pickups have been shot to death and Moss discovers only one survivor who is very near death and who pleads for a drink of water.Moss ignores the request and searches the site, discovering a large amount of heroin remaining in one of the trucks. There is no corresponding amount of money and so Moss deduces that at least one person got away. A very good tracker, he discovers the path of one wounded person leaving the site. He follows the track and comes across the man, dead, and clinging to a suitcase with a little over two million dollars in it. Anyone who's ever read a book like A Simple Plan or seen a noir movie made from that or another book like it would know damned good and well just to walk away. But if he did that, of course, there would be no story.Llewellyn hikes out with the money, takes it home and hides it in his trailer home. So far, so good. But then, in the middle of the night, he's stricken by a pang of conscience and decides that he really should take some water out to the guy he left dying at the site of the shootout. Well, hell, a child of five knows that this is going to be a huge mistake. To his credit, so does Llewellyn. But he does it anyway.Naturally, when he returns he runs into several bad guys who know that someone got away with their money and are damned anxious to know who it might be. They shoot up Llewellyn's pickup, but he manages to escape and make it back home. He quickly sends his wife out of town to what he hopes will be the safety of her mother and then hits the road himself in an effort to somehow escape the rain of crap that he knows is about to cascade down upon him.On his trail is a particularly amoral and devious hit man named Chigurh who has a particularly awesome and deadly weapon and who seems to be almost prescient in determining where Moss will be. Also on the trail is an aging county sheriff named Bell. Bell is a veteran of World War II who is distressed about the changes taking place in the world around him and who speculates that in the drug warriors and especially in the person of Chigurh, there is a new sort of evil in the world that no one can hope to contain.The result is a powerful story told by one of the great masters. Moss's efforts to extricate himself from the mess he knew he was getting himself into all along are compelling. Chigurh's apparent total lack of all human sensibilities are horrifying, and Sheriff Bell's meditations on his marriage and on the evolution of the world around him are thought-provoking and elegiac. All in all, a great novel."}, {"userName": "Trevor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor", "userReview": "To be honest, I found this a bit irritating. It jumped around a little too much and the violence was pointless and excessive. I also found the \u2018home-spun\u2019 philosophy a bit hard to take. There was not a single character in this book that I would urinate on if they were on fire \u2013 their deaths, therefore, were devoid of interest. I guess this book is Dirty Harry from the darkside. Same crap, same fascination with guns and the voyeurism caused by the effect bullets have on the human anatomy - I wonder what it is about modern life that eroticises violence so much?People say things like McCarthy is the \u2018greatest living writer\u2019 in the US.

Things have been crazy, but you just know this scene is going to take the cake. Everything's come down to this and I couldn't wait. ...and then we jump ahead to the aftermath. I had to go back on the audiobook and re-listen to the scenes leading up to the aftermath. Nothing. Moss is talking to his hitchhiker girl one moment and suddenly they're both dead and bloody. The injustice! I wanted that scene so bad!But then I got to thinking and for some reason I actually thought Moss had a chance against this lunatic. Even though McCarthy's been telling me the entire time that things are bad. Really bad. People like this are REALLY REALLY bad. The worst. And I still had hope. I think McCarthy is saying here that not only did he tell us (literally the entire book), but that it was so obvious that it didn't even need telling. Also, he's not telling that story. What he's telling is the story of how bad people are and what happens after Moss and the hitchhiker is a thousand times worse. To have that scene would have taken away from the horror that is that final discussion between Chigurh and Carla Jean. It didn't even compare to the atrocity that occurs in that scene. And I guess that's what I'll take from it.

And now Cormac McCarthy tackles a crime thriller and does what he usually does, turns it into something else that's part of a whole different genre: \"Cormac McCarthy Fiction.\"It starts as a simple noir. Llewellyn Moss is out hunting game when he stumbles onto a botched drug deal complete with dead Mexicans, dead dogs, dead trucks, and a satchel of 2 million dollars. He decides that finders keepers, so he does what any hot-blooded human would do and takes it for himself, setting off a chain reaction of violence across Texas, as a multitude of enemies search for him. I prefer the more recent McCarthy novels, like this one and The Road, to his earlier work. It feels like he's been able to really hone his style and become more disciplined and economical, straying away from some of the distracting bloat without losing any of the trademark lyricism and rumination he's famous for. And this book has some of his best characters. I think that Moss is a great \"hero,\" a simple but resourceful man of straight action while still being charming, while with his lady Carla Jean, I at first got the sense that she was a bimbo, but she turns out to be much stronger, resilient, and acute than I initially thought. McCarthy really surprised me with her character. And then there's Anton Chigurh, the enigmatic figure doggedly chasing Moss. He's less of a person than a force, similar to the Judge in Blood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the West. He's the embodiment of unstoppable judgment and inescapable fate. His character is pretty unsettling. \n\nAnything can be an instrument, Chigurh said. Small things. Things you wouldn't even notice. They pass from hand to hand. People don't pay attention. And then one day there's an accounting. And after that nothing is the same.\n\nBut then you have the character of Sheriff Bell, whose character is what provides the soul and transforms this crime noir into Cormac McCarthy fiction, and turns a four star book into a five-star book. He's the real main character here, providing a point of view for the reader, as he muses on the nature of violence and his horror at the way that evil has evolved into something that he's unable reckon with. \n\nThings happen to you they happen. They don't ask first. They don't require your permission.\n\nAnother stunning, instant-classic McCarthy novel."}, {"userName": "Olivier Delaye", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9854601-olivier-delaye", "userReview": "So you decided to reread this book, he said.Huh?I said you decided to reread this book?Sure.Third time around?Sure.Dont get old?Never.As good as The Road?Sure.
