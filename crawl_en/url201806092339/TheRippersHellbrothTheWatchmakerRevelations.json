A modern day copy car killer, with a 'cat and mouse game' between the killer and the police. Can the killer be caught before the next victim is taken?The narrative flips between the present day, and Victorian times - which at times can be quite disorientating, and interrupts the flow of the story. However, I enjoyed the unique perspective of this. If felt like a 'new' ideal, rather than someone merely rehashing the Jack the Ripper story, although I did find myself craving more of the historical story-line.I found the plot itself quite atmospheric, haunting and well researched - perfect for Halloween, especially (again) the chapters set in the past. It's also tied up completely, with no gaping plot holes (a bugbear of mine).A decent story, with a more unique plot. Great for this time of year when it's foggy outside. You can almost imagine Jack lurking in the shadows..."}, {"userName": "Kirsty &#x1f4da;&#x1f4d6;\u2764\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5390112-kirsty-x1f4da-x1f4d6", "userReview": "There's a Ripper copycat killer in New York and the police can't catch him so they call in FBI profiler Edward Dunham. This book swaps between the Ripper Story of 1888 and the modern murders. I really enjoyed the Ripper story, not just because it's a familiar tale. It flowed really well and was well written. I believe the author has written non-fiction about that time period and it showed in the writing.\u00a0For me it fell down with the modern half. With all the characters in both parts there were just too many people to follow and I often lost track. Their language and need to explain everything grated on me too. It lacked the flow of the other story.\u00a0I enjoyed the premise and the idea of mixing up the too and the book did keep my interest throughout.\u00a0Free arc from netgalley"}, {"userName": "Mandy White", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33018840-mandy-white", "userReview": "A modern day copy cat Jack the Ripper killer in New York.

It adds a new and nice angle to the original horror story and adds plenty of its own.A must for those still intrigued by the Rippers\u2019 legacy and who want a further insight into what started back in 1888 and was never solved."}, {"userName": "Melissa Borsey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30379107-melissa-borsey", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for my honest review. A good story that alternates chapters from the modern day \"copycat\" Jack the Ripper and the Jack the Ripper murders (quite gruesome) of the past. A serial killer expert called the Watchmaker is brought in to catch the killer. With a fast-paced story and interesting characters, this book held my attention from beginning to end. Well worth the read!"}, {"userName": "Ionia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16434239-ionia", "userReview": "I liked the premise of this novel, and thought that the idea of a modern day Ripper was an interesting one to explore, but I found myself struggling a bit with the switches in time, from present day to Victorian. It was jarring at times and prevented me from following either part of the story as closely as I would have liked. Still, the writing is good and the author clearly knows the facts behind the original Ripper case, which made gave this book a solid foundation and made it more interesting to read, I thought. The Watchmaker kept my attention throughout the story and there were quite a few unexpected events in the book that kept me guessing about what was going to happen next. Overall, I thought this was a brilliant idea, but the execution could have been better if the switches in time period weren't so blunt. Still, a great book for those who enjoy the Ripper or just a good mystery in general. This review is based on a complimentary copy from the publisher, provided through Netgalley. All opinions are my own."}, {"userName": "Lisa Henderson-Farr", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7228449-lisa-henderson-farr", "userReview": "Thank you to Sunbury Press and NetGalley for an advance copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. The storyline follows the original Jack the Ripper murders of the 19th century as well as the present day investigation of a Jack the Ripper copycat. The story alternates back and forth between the two timelines with each victim getting us closer to the unknown suspect. I actually found the historical investigation more appealing than the present day, that is, until near the end of the book when everything started to tie in together. We learn of a close connection between the murder sprees in each century that involves a bit of a supernatural twist. The author has left us with some unanswered questions that sets a great foundation for a second book."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6666306-susan", "userReview": "As present day Western New York is plagued by a serial killer seemingly copying Jack the Ripper we also follow his story in Whitechapel of the 1880's.
