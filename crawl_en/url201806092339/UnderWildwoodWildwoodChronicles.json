I normally take pride in giving up on a book I'm not enjoying. I am in charge of my reading life! I don't let guilt propel me! There are too many great books I'll never read to waste time on those I don't like. Why did I keep on reading this one even though I was not enjoying it?1. I enjoyed the first one. I assume it's going to be a trilogy and I like reading trilogies. 3 is the magic number!2. I like the look and feel of the books. The illustrations are lovely.3. It's a mythologized version of my own city, nearby neighborhoods and the Forrest Park wooded area that crowns Portland.4. My husband bought it for me for Christmas. I like getting books for Christmas.5. It seemed like I would enjoy it if I would just straighten up my attitude.I was bored. It was tedious. There was no heart. I thought the underworld would be more like an underworld (more banished souls and/or a devil character and less moles.) The Portland references (including the Shanghai Tunnels) and a nod to our Pabst Blue Ribbon hipster culture only made me roll my eyes. And now it's over and it was such an unsatisfying non-conclusion, which means that there will be no closure unless I read the 3rd and final installment. I don't wanna. I'll read the Cliff's Notes but that's it."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45261627-sarah", "userReview": "Congratulations, Colin Meloy, for producing a second installment that was noticeably better than the first!A few months after Prue McKeel and Curtis Mehlberg entered the Impassible Wilderness to rescue Prue\u2019s baby brother from an evil sorceress, life has returned to mostly normal for the McKeel family, although Prue is struggling in school and her parents don\u2019t know why. The Mehlbergs have had no such luck. Curtis is still missing, and the parents are so desperate to find him that they flew to Turkey, leaving their two daughters, Rachel and Elsie, at the decidedly creepy Unthank Home for Wayward Youth.Meanwhile Curtis has been happily training as a bandit in the Wildwood, almost never remembering his parents and sisters. The mad Dowager Governess was defeated (although we all know the drill with fantasy \u201cdeaths\u201d without a body to show for it) leaving chaos in the wood. Warring factions have sprung up and no one seems to know who the leader should be. Iphigenia, Chief Mystic and priestess of the Great Tree, insists that Prue needs to come back if the Wood should be saved. The girl\u2019s destiny has not yet run its course.Back in Portland, Prue confides in a concerned new teacher, Ms. Thennis. Prue suspects the Wood is calling her back, but what\u2019s wrong now?Content AdvisoryViolence: Like the first book\u2014not much, but what\u2019s there is startlingly bloody for a middle-grade book. We see a shape-shifter get stabbed, and her shape changes from her human to animal form as it dies. Assassins are sent after children, and while they are unsuccessful, that\u2019s not for lack of effort or menace on their part. Joffrey Unthank forces children to labor in his factory, and some have been maimed or terribly injured in said factory. Some rebellious kids burn down a building.Sex: Prue notices that Curtis\u2019 shoulders are starting to broaden. That\u2019s it.Language: None.Substance Abuse: None.Nightmare Fuel: The aforementioned shape-shifter is described in a frightening way, and one of the illustrations portraying her in mid-morph gave me the willies. That said, it\u2019s a lot less scary than the first book. Know your kids. Kids, know yourselves.Miscellaneous: There\u2019s a villainous Ukrainian character who speaks in a stereotypical accent and generally acts like an evil agent from the Rocky & Bullwinkle cartoon. She\u2019s not super offensive, but she still comes off as a product of accidental xenophobia.ConclusionsThe first volume in the Wildwood series, simply entitled Wildwood, really rubbed me the wrong way for a variety of reasons. The characters were hard to empathize with, the story took too long to get where it was going, and the whole thing was so hipster it had never heard of itself. Not to mention that the narrator\u2019s fondness for obscure vocabulary words made it hard to picture what was happening at some points. However, the book had a lot of potential. It stole from the best\u2014C.S. Lewis, Terry Pratchett, Jim Henson, and a wee dash of J.R.R. Tolkien at the end\u2014while bringing its own Old Americana aesthetic and an agreeably spooky mood. The illustrations by Carson Ellis (who happens to be Meloy\u2019s wife and album-cover artist) were charming pieces of folk art. The first book dashed my hopes, but for some reason the second one called to me. And while not the greatest general-audience fantasy novel ever written, it\u2019s actually quite agreeable. The addition of Joffrey Unthank and his orphanage/factory is straight outta Lemony Snicket, which both is and isn\u2019t an improvement on the first book. It\u2019s an improvement because a lot of the weirder \u201creal world\u201d parts make sense if the \u201creal world\u201d in this universe is a Snicketesque realm of absurdism. Yet it\u2019s also a step back because there was no indication in book one that this world was like that. It\u2019s a good ret-con, but still a ret-con. And even in such a surreal place, Mom and Dad Mehlberg leaving their two remaining children in such a place while they go to search for their son doesn\u2019t jive with what little we know about them. Violet, Klaus and Sunny Baudelaire wound up in situations this bad and worse, but their parents were dead. Big difference.On a related note, the almost bloodless battle between the kids and the Industrial Titans\u2019 goons was underwhelming after the spectacle at the Plinth in the first book, wherein people actually died and there were fantastical creatures. This one felt a little too much like the end of a '90s family comedy. It just did not go with the tone of the previous book, or this one up until that point. As for the Titans themselves, Big Business being the villain has become clich\u00e9, but it usually doesn\u2019t share antagonist duties with faceless magical forces, so watching the heroes battle both in Wildwood Imperium should actually be interesting.The hipster milieu from the first book has also been greatly toned down. It has receded to the background, where it\u2019s just fine. Prue and Curtis no longer try to wriggle out of their destined duties, and they certainly aren\u2019t ranting anymore about emotional support while everyone else is marching off to die. They have figured out that pacifism is a good policy in Portland, but will not save you from an evil sorceress or a shape-shifting assassin. When one lives in two different worlds, one can accommodate two different worldviews. Also no more posturing about expensive jeans or coffee. They were actually believable twelve-year-olds this time around. And Curtis got called out for being selfish and oblivious\u2014by Prue, by the narrator, and by his own conscience. Character development. It\u2019s a good thing.Rachel and Elsie, Curtis\u2019 sisters, are not terribly unique\u2014Rachel is a typical sulky goth teen, Elsie is a typical bright-eyed little girl who brings her doll everywhere\u2014but they were believable and likeable enough. They reminded me of both Susan and Lucy Pevensie from Narnia, and Wirt and Greg from Over the Garden Wall. Both very nice sets of sibling characters to be reminded of.The most interesting new addition to the ensemble hasn\u2019t even shown up yet. Remember Alexei, son of Alexandra? When he died, she went mad with grief and forced two Daedalus-like geniuses to rebuild him as an automaton, only for Alexei to figure out what he really was and destroy himself. Well, Prue has been told by the Great Tree that her task is to revive Alexei somehow, that only this can save the Wood. Some reviewers think this refers to an act of dark magic, and while it might, I can see another possibility: Prue must descend into this universe\u2019s Land of the Dead, find Alexei, and help him \u201creturn to the Sunlit Lands\u201d (h/t \nThe Silver Chair\n). I really hope this is what Meloy means: the descent and return of figures like Persephone, Dionysus, Orpheus and Psyche are some of the most potent stories in all of mythology. All told, this was a decent book, much better than I expected one in this series to be, and my curiosity is piqued for the third and final installment."}, {"userName": "Ingrid", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4303543-ingrid", "userReview": "My goodness Colin Meloy turned this series around! At the end of the last one, I was pleased. It seemed like a good, happy way to wrap things up (ignoring the fact that Curtis never went home. I didn't agree with that.) However, in this second book, he takes the book to a much darker level. People die. Hands are cut off. Both of these things I tend to appreciate in books. (Queen of Attolia. Best plot twist ever.)Anyway, despite (or perhaps because of) the darker feel to this book, I really enjoyed it. It was exciting, it was unique, and I adore the setting. The Wildwood has such a Narnia feel to it that gives me warm fuzzies. The main thing that annoyed me with this book was the interlude with the moles. I mean, obviously, they had to go to the moles to get the information on the makers, but did it have to go for so long? Did they need to be a part of a whole war on the behalf of the moles? It took forever and all the caps-locks were irritating. I definitely think that Meloy could have cut down some of the parts and made it a bit shorter. However, this was still a good book. And still a good series to read aloud to perhaps an nine or ten year old (it wasn't that dark, just darker than the last one.) I certainly look forward to the last book. (Wonder what it will be called: Over Wildwood? Through Wildwood? Wild Wildwood?)"}, {"userName": "BookishStitcher", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher", "userReview": "4.5A rare second book in the trilogy that is better than the first.

Meloy definitely took this story to depths not seen in the first book, and he approached bloodshed with zero fluff.Somehow the entire 559 pages are spent merely aligning things for the third book, though a hearty amount of new characters are introduced and new places explored. Unfortunately I was turned off almost immediately by WAY too many \"hold ups\" in the book.. meaning.. characters kept saying the phrase \"Hold up\" instead of \"wait a minute\", \"hold on\" or even \"just a second\", and for some reason it really irritated me. It seemed Meloy tried too hard to find a \"tween\" voice at parts in order to relate to pre-teen readers, but it wasn't necessary as he pulled off Wildwood (book 1) in his own words and it worked wonderfully. Also too many \"could only be described as\"es and backpedaling paragraphs to defend a thought or situation that the reader probably already remembered from previous narrative. In the end and all negatives aside, Meloy's written style won me over again. I prefer the first book to this one, but Under Wildwood still craftily carried me off to the magic places and characters of the series that I love reading about."}, {"userName": "Jan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1024357-jan", "userReview": "This series just keeps getting better. I honestly had to force myself to go to work this week. I just wanted to stay home so I could continue reading this story that I was so caught up in. Were Prue, Curtis, and the Children from the Unthank Orphanage ever going to get out of the very dire situations they had found themselves in? Would Curtis be able to find his way back to his bandit family? Would Prue be able to complete the seemingly insurmountable task she was given and be able to save Wildwood? Were Curtis' sisters ever going to find out the truth about happened to him? And would they all get out of this alive?

It just didn't capture me the same way, and while I didn't mind that this book was a little darker, it was lacking a spark that kept me wanting to read it every day. I did finish it, and while the prose is lovely and Prue was still a great protagonist, everything in terms of the story fell flat and didn't keep me engaged. Also, why did the moles speak in caps lock? That got really irritating after while.If Meloy keeps Wildwood going, I know I'll still check it out. I just feel like this book may be mis-marketed in a lot of ways, as it's labelled middle grade, yet it makes references to things from the late 70s, early 80s, something I don't think this middle grader generation would pick up on or understand. I get that Meloy has some very older roots (it's very prevalent in his music, which I adore), but I feel like his style and his desire to tell a very old fashioned fairy tale with a hipster twist didn't quite pan out the way I hoped it would. We shall see, I love the universe Colin Meloy has created, so for all I know it could have been a \"it's not you, it's me\" situation. :/"}, {"userName": "Madeline Knight-Dixon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5518809-madeline-knight-dixon", "userReview": "This book is just as magical and intriguing as the first one. It continues the story of the world right on the edge of our world, but this time shows the grittier side of both. Children being used for free labor, assassins of some fanatic religious group, overcoming tyrannical leaders, abandoning your family to live the life you want and the consequences that come with that. I mean I can\u2019t think of a young adult book that does ALL this at once besides this one.My favorite part is still the illustrations though. They\u2019re so charming, and they help bring the story to life without forcing you to imagine everything a certain way. Every few pages there will be this small image to help guide you, which makes reading it so much more fun.Not to mention the lessons about growing up in this book are completely unreal. I felt like I grew up just reading it, and I\u2019m 23. No matter how old you are, you\u2019re never too old to get slapped in the face by the reality that you\u2019ll always have to make hard decisions, even if you run away from them.

I love them and hate them. They fascinate me and bore me at the same time. This book is over 500 pages and it took me almost a year to finish reading it once I had started. It's very descriptive and almost slow until suddenly it isn't. I felt that way about the first book as well. I had to make myself sit down to read it only to discover by the time I was done reading that day, I'd finished a good portion of the book. This book sets up for the third and I hated that realization because I wanted to be able to leave the series behind and read something faster. I might still hold off on book three. Overall, the world is fun. The characters are many and interesting. The language is a little mature and not too childish for adult readers. Honestly, I don't know if a child would much like the books. They are a bit complicated. Random review and I feel like I'm spiraling, but that's kind of how reading the book was for me as well. So, fitting?"}, {"userName": "Audra", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2015709-audra", "userReview": "I should have reread my review of the first one before buying the second. Geesh.Once I started reading, I remembered a vague sense of not loving the series, but couldn't remember why. So, I kept reading. After about 300 pages, the \"why\" became clear.In Middle Earth, Frodo undertakes an overwhelming odyssey, to save Middle Earth from a great evil: total domination and destruction by Sauron.In Narnia, the four children, never before trained in battle, arm and prepare to fight a great evil: the White Witch, the curse of eternal winter, and her tyranny over all Narnians.In Harry Potter, Harry is challenged again and again to over come the most evil wizard of all time, in order to save not just his friends and family, but all Muggles and Muggle-born wizards, everywhere.In Wildwood, Prue and Curtis (and apparently his sisters) must use their wits, wiles, and resources to fight a great evil: Industry and Capitalism. Because the Five Titans of Industry want to use the trees in the Impassable Wilderness to make money.I get that some people do see that as a great evil; I, too, love and support the National Parks, conservation, and wisdom with our resources. But is that a compelling basis for a 1500-page trilogy? No.Furthermore, and RELIGIOUS PARENTS OF CHILDREN WHO LOVE FANTASY FICTION, TAKE NOTE: This book is written from an animistic perspective, but takes the religious debate a step further: I would argue that it is anti-organized-religion. The above-mentioned critically-acclaimed and historically-beloved fantasy series all feature magic and sorcery, and conveniently ignore any question of religion, or attempt to reconcile religion with the content of the story. They also all rely heavily on animistic elements and some religious typing, with a savior-figure who either has deity and sovereignty (Aslan), or on whom the salvation of the known world relies (Harry and Aragorn). That's all ok with me, because it allows a religious person to read and enjoy the story without having to reconcile \"magic\" and \"religion.\" But Wildwood takes a different tack: It's clear that Meloy has no use for a monotheistic god ('\"Gods rest her soul,\" he said'), or for religion in general (\"I know she wouldn't go in fer that claptrap, the gods and all, but I says it anyways.\" [p.255]). It takes a special disdain for religion and the religious to so infuse that tone into one's work that it's actually insulting to the reader, and he manages to convey that disdain.Overall, I just found the book disappointing (especially because his prose is still lovely and readable - Meloy IS actually a good writer). I don't expect a book to cater to me, and I enjoy reading different perspectives. If he'd simply wanted to write a book glorifying nature and vilifying industry, and encapsulate that philosophy in a fiction work, it would probably have been enjoyable. But that isn't this book, and this book left me completely dissatisfied."}, {"userName": "Kelly Bunch", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18343811-kelly-bunch", "userReview": "This second installment in the Wildwood series was just as magical as the previous book. I had my doubts after finishing book one that I would enjoy book two as much as I did. The size was honestly daunting even to me. This sense has kind of been niggling at the back of my mind while I've been reading it, like there was something off about it that I couldn't quite place. While I enjoyed the first book and enjoyed it's mood which to me was similar to Chronicles of Narnia in its magical atmosphere I realized the other books that it reminded me of. They definitely have a dash of Grimm's fairy tales. While the main characters are children who are faced with real danger I guess what makes it seem darker to me is that it isn't always easy to tell friend from foe. Who is trustworthy and who is lying? What is safe and what's a trap? There is an unsettling unrest that keeps the reader both anxious for the characters' wellbeing and also completely glued to the story to see what will happen next. Personally, I find it keeps me from really enjoying the magic but I tend to enjoy the lighter side of fantasy books overall. I think the only other thing that I didn't enjoy was the Unthank Home. I have been in childcare related jobs for most of my life and I love working with children. Therefore, it is really difficult for me to read about anything that is injurious to children. Without spoilers there wasn't anything extreme or graphic just a very bleak reality and lack of care for children which is always really difficult for me to read about. However, it does seem incredibly important not only to this installment but also to the next so I'll be curious to see how it resolves. I definitely think I'll have to pick up (borrow) the last book in the series soon."}, {"userName": "Hollowspine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2069761-hollowspine", "userReview": "3.5The sequel to Wildwood takes place only a few months after the action of the first story. For Prue and Curtis however, it seems a lot longer. The story at first rotates between the two characters, Prue back in Portland living a dull life and daydreaming about her time in the IW. Curtis, on the other hand, has formed a new family among the Wildwood bandits.Although I really enjoyed listening to Meloy's narration, I didn't enjoy Under Wildwood as much as the first book. It felt rushed at points, but also meandered at other times. Some of the kid's dialog got a bit silly (they took turns one trying to explain something the other saying, \"Hold up...\" just like that too. No, \"Wait a minute,\" or \"Whaaat??\" or anything other than \"Hold up...\" there cowboy.The story of the Dowager Governess in the first book wasn't happy go lucky, but Under Wildwood takes the darkness a bit further. I was a bit surprised the amount of blood shed throughout the book, especially adding vicious assassins to full out Mole war.I enjoyed the moles. I found them interesting characters in their world and especially as Gwendolyn reveals her own beliefs. However, I'm glad I listened to the audio version since the mole's speech is in all caps, which would get trying after a while.The ending too, left me a little confused. While the first novel ended really well, both concluding the plot of the novel, yet leaving enough to ponder on for the sequel, this second novel felt like it ended just as it began in the middle of the action.Overall, not as strong as the first, but still enjoyable.

But their lives are disrupted again, this time by an assassination attempt which sends them on a long quest to resurrect a ruler and save the Wood. Under Wildwood continues the stylistic traditions of its predecessor, but this is a darker book. Rambling and whimsical, lengthy but so diverse--exploring new areas of the map and introducing a number of new characters--that it never drags, it affects an almost mythical tone. But this view of Wildwood and its surroundings is starker, darker, and far more grim--not a new direction to take a children's series, but one that contrasts and compliments the whimsy and highlights the book's surprisingly vivid emotional landscape. Ellis's illustrations are the ideal companion, folksy and stylized but rendered suitably in thick blacks shot through with bright red.Unfortunately, Under Wildwood also does what I hate most about series and ends halfway, with the third book promising to finish up this particular quest. The comperably involved, extended journey suits the darker tone, but I'd still prefer a finished story; this is why I tend to avoid series. But I'm invested in Wildwood, enjoyed this installation, and will see it through. I don't believe these are new classics, but they have a certain beauty, especially for a St. John's resident: the location shines, as much a character as Prue or Curtis, and the series has a well-defined, unique tone that refuses to grow stagnant.

I wish I had reread the first book so it would have been a little fresher in my mind, it would have helped me jump into this book quicker. We again follow Prue on an adventure into Wildwood fraught with adversaries and danger. Teamed with Curtis her former classmate, they navigate the tunnels under the mysterious woods to complete a task that will save the woods. This books introduces several new characters and brings back a few favors. The downside of this book is it falls inline with the typical middle of the series syndrome where the story is not fully wrapped up so it feels like a little bit of a filler book. Just a little, not enough for me to be indignant or anything. I can't wait for the last book to come out. These books are beautifully illustrated by the authors wife and they are wonderfully affordable. Seriously, Christmas is coming people!"}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8370343-hannah", "userReview": "I downloaded this in audiobook format from my library's website late one night, in the throes of severe insomnia and desperate for something to lull me to sleep.Surely it can't be as bad as the first one, I thought to myself, and BOY WAS I WRONG.Please stop, Colin Meloy. Your music is amazing and your glasses are totally happening, but your books are just so boring. So. Boring. If this had been written by a nobody, I highly doubt any publisher would have given it a second thought. It's like any other fantasy novel aimed at middle schoolers, but three times longer and not quite as good. It's like The Chronicles of Narnia and Peter Pan got blended together and spit out of some hipster's Vitamix. The mere fact that I made it all the way to the most awkwardly pretentious epilogue ever written, says more about my determination to finish than the actual book itself.However, 5 stars for putting me to sleep without fail. On that front, this book was invaluable."}, {"userName": "Kinsey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15239952-kinsey", "userReview": "A great sequel, in my opinion better than the first. The multiple story lines heightened suspense and enriched the complex world of Wildwood and the outside world of Portland. The new characters brought much needed additional perspectives and helped make the story's pace seem faster and more engaging than the first. Though a very long drawn out story, the author uses that time to provide more character depth and events to weave the web of saving Wildwood. It does feel like a distinct journey from the first book, but the cliffhanger end connects it very closely with the events in the next book. Sometimes I was bogged down in the length and definitely felt more interested in some story lines than others, but I look forward to reading the next book to find out what happens to the many cast of characters and the magical Wildwood."}, {"userName": "Bivisyani Questibrilia", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18519232-bivisyani-questibrilia", "userReview": "Truth be told, this book isn't as good as the first one. But it sure did answer a lot of questions. It obviously still has the significant touches that the authors had in the first volume but with a lot more intricate detail as well as whimsical values that the prequel doesn't have. It is the start of the thread that connects both the Woods and the Outside. Most fantasy novels don't connect one world with the other and deem one is non-existent when the other one does. I have to say that the mole people are my favourite! They're so adorable, I can't even handle it. This book starts to make it clear that the author doesn't intend on leaving everything to one single hero/heroine to save the day."}, {"userName": "Lisa Ard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1355052-lisa-ard", "userReview": "Prue and Curtis are back, with another knock out adventure inside and outside Wildwood, the not so mythical forest on Portland\u2019s edge. This book finds Curtis enmeshed in the bandit life while Prue makes a go of life with her family in outside world (St. John\u2019s neighborhood). But, evil is afoot. When a shape shifter impersonates a schoolteacher, Prue is in danger. Rescued and flown back to Wildwood, Prue finds a calling from the North Wood she cannot refuse. Enlisting Curtis\u2019s help, the half-breed children are off on another journey to save their friends, the woods, and themselves. New villians and new friends abound, all artfully woven into a story of good and evil that centers on Wildwood. Wonderful illustrations and thoughtful art layout by Carson Ellis augment the story."}, {"userName": "Joe Vajgrt", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2404147-joe-vajgrt", "userReview": "I know it's a kid's book... But it's a FANTASTIC kid's book. I wish I had this series to read when I was growing up. Meloy's story telling is at times laugh-out-loud funny and is constantly engaging. Ellis' illustrations create a rich tapestry that enhances the story telling through a unique an consistent visual style. It's hard to put this book down, and it's easy to tear through it in just a few sittings. This is a fantastic book to get your kids to read, or to read to them. The 2nd book in the series, this leaves the reader with a much greater cliffhanger than the first book of the trilogy. Thankfully, book #3 is well on its way and is supposed to be out by this time next year.

I'm not quite sure anything actually happened in this book. Prue and Curtis really annoy me. Curtis is so incredibly self-absorbed. They seriously don't think about their real families at all??? At least there wasn't much about the super annoying hipster parents in this book. I can't stand all the annoying hipsters that have infiltrated my city (ummm the author included). The secondary storyline about Curtis' sister was much more interesting to me. Hopefully that line of the book continues."}, {"userName": "Sydne Scivally", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11808646-sydne-scivally", "userReview": "What can I say about this book? It was absolutely phenomenal! The main characters were just as relatable as ever, the plotline remained fresh and new, and their conflicts were just as harrowing. For every plot point that was closed from the previous novel, three more were introduced. And that last chapter....it was like the quiet moment before a bomb explodes.

It is one of those books that doesn't have any resolution at the end because it's part of a series. Instead of being excited for the next book in the \"Chronicles of Wildwood\" it just kind of pissed me off. I like the characters but it felt like a waste of time. Sorry, Colin Meloy.
