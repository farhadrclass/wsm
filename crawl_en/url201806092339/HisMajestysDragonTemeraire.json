I fell right in love with Temeraire! And I love Laurence and his love for Temeraire, he really knew how to take care of his dragon! I want one too dang it. \u2764Laurence was a captain on a Naval ship when they found a French ship with an egg on it. Well, of course they took the egg and when it hatched, the little black dragon picked Laurence. Well, life as he knew it was over as he was going to have to leave the Navy and train with the Aerial Corps. They ride dragons and have a crew on the dragon with you and fight the enemy. Oh what joy! I loved all of the dragons in the book and there were several of the men and women I loved too. I mean this is just an awesome book full of wonderful people and dragons. Well, there was this one ole bastard named Rankin and he treated his little dragon Levitas horribly! I hated him and I felt so sorry for Levitas. Laurence started doing nice things for the little dragon and it was so sweet. Oh, oh and the dragons talk! For the love of all that's holy, I want a talking dragon! I wish my dog could talk too but then they both would probably drive me crazy, but I digress! Anyway, most of the book is about training Laurence and Temeraire with the other dragons and captains but it was so much fun. There are a few battles they get into a little later but setting up this world was so freaking awesome. I have never had so much fun. I mean talking dragons, how could you not love it.

To tell the truth, if I'd seen it in a bookstore, I wouldn't have picked it up. But it was recommended to me by a reliable source as a better alternative to Eragon, and it was a historical fantasy set during the Napoleonic Wars. I figured I'd give it a try. I didn't regret it.I don't love this book because Naomi Novik's writing style is equal to that of Tolkien. I don't love this book because it's perfect in every way - indeed, some of the subplots were rather weak, and should have been changed or cut out altogether. Rather, I love this book because Naomi Novik took a boring, cliche idea, and put on a spin on it that's so brilliant and yet mind-bogglingly obvious I have to wonder why in the world someone hadn't thought of it before.In all of the previous dragonrider books I'd read, there was always one rider. One lone human on a dragon the size of a house. And somehow, that was supposed to be special and sensible and realistic. But no - if a dragon is that large, then why is there only one rider? Why can't there be more? Having one rider on a dragon is like putting one passenger on a plane that could potentially carry fifty.And that's where Naomi Novik takes the Temeraire series. Her fight scenes aren't one-on-one affairs, they're all-out aerial battles fought with crew members dangling precariously from leather harnesses, forced to make the best of inaccurate rifles. It's true, the captain has a special relationship with his or her dragon, but there's the distinct feeling of a team - that the captain would really be nowhere without the support of a crew behind him. What's more, Novik makes the battles work - they're clearly planned out and make sense in a historical context.The main characters are also unusually engaging - Laurence, as a former naval captain who accidentally stumbles upon a dragon egg, is plunged into a branch of the military completely unlike the one in which he's served, and his confusion and stiffness are only to be expected. While his stubbornness and sense of propriety are on occasion mildly irritating, his reactions to elements of the Aerial Corps are only natural given his character. And Temeraire, the dragon that hatches from the egg Laurence discovers, is more than a mere sentient ship - his naive, inquisitive personality is adorably appealing, and the political views he develops at times contrast sharply with those of Laurence.And then there's the matter of the main villain - there is none. There's no evil overlord to face, no Dark Lord Napoleon who tries to foil Laurence's and Temeraire's plans at every turn. In fact, despite the fact that the book is from a strictly British point of view, Novik portrays Napoleon fairly, and his character only grows more sympathetic as the series goes on. Napoleon doesn't even make an appearance during the first book - it's just the British Aerial Corps versus the French Armee de l'Air. It's a lovely change; as the battles grow steadily more climactic, one gets the feeling that they're in a war against other dragon-crews just like theirs, not fighting some unseen maniac.Like I said, His Majesty's Dragon isn't perfect. The subplot with Choiseul is ultimately disappointing in its resolution, and Laurence's love interest is perilously close to a Mary-Sue and should have been cut (thankfully, there's a lot less of her in the following books). Still, it's a refreshingly original spin on an overused idea, and all in all a very good read."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10067920-samantha", "userReview": "4.5 stars!

In all fairness, the way people described this book and series gave me a very different impression than what the first book actually entailed. They\u2019d say, \u201cit\u2019s an alternate military history, but with dragons.\u201d I\u2019m sure that description is completely accurate for the series as a whole, but had someone mentioned even briefly that His Majesty\u2019s Dragon was less about alt-history as a focus (even though that was an essential setting component) and more about the forming bond between a man and his dragon, I\u2019d have been on board the Temeraire ship years ago. Unfortunately first impressions caused me to hold off. When it came out I was in the middle of college and the last thing I wanted to do was put down one text book and pick up another (even if the new one had dragons). I thought I\u2019d be bored with the historical elements and recycled battle scenes. All the discussions I\u2019d had about it with customers made me think I was getting into a dry historical retelling that took itself too seriously. This is SO NOT THE CASE!!The relationship between man and dragon is 100% the appeal of the book for me. It\u2019s a slowly paced plot that focuses on the bond and establishes the groundwork for what\u2019s to come. Because of the aforementioned expectations for the series, I\u2019m certain some ventured in looking for battle sequences, military strategy, and loads of historical references, but were bored with their lack (which is an irony considering my boredom might have stemmed from those things being present if I\u2019d read it 10 years ago). As I said, perhaps the series as a whole will offer those things, but for me this book offered perfect immersion into what it\u2019s like to be a dragonrider (or Aerialist) in training. Now that my tastes have broadened, I\u2019m actually looking forward to seeing the historical immersion in future books, but that alone wouldn\u2019t have been enough to get me to pick up the series. The dragons are my main motivation. Not only was Temeraire a fascinating creature, but so were the many other varieties of dragons (aka Niki\u2019s dragon heaven). I loved the training aspects and can\u2019t wait to see those put into good use, I loved the commander of the training encampment (you\u2019ll see), and I loved the relationships and dynamics beginning to form between all the trainees and their dragons. Basically, this is the book I\u2019ve been hounding to find all my life. \ud83d\ude2dThe slow burn of this novel might have bored a few people, but I reveled in every single moment. It had me so wrapped up, I even shed a tear or two (I can\u2019t remember the last time a book made me cry). The combination of a fantastic main character, sentient dragons (filled with awesomeness), and the overall theme of the series set His Majesty\u2019s Dragon up as one of the best books I\u2019ve read in a while. I can\u2019t wait to get my hands on the next one!Recommendations: Read this book if you like dragons. It\u2019s a bonus if you also like alt-history. ;PVia The Obsessive Bookseller at www.NikiHawkes.com  Other books you might like:"}, {"userName": "\u2718\u2718 Sarah \u2718\u2718 (former Nefarious Breeder of Murderous Crustaceans)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans", "userReview": "[It does explain why you're all so screwed up, though (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Alex Farrand", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37663070-alex-farrand", "userReview": "3.5 starsHis Majesty's Dragon  is about a sea captain, who after capturing a French frigate, and seizing a valuable, unhatched dragon egg from the French is brought to an unexpected journey that changes his life forever. His Majesty's Dragon is a fantasy, historical fiction novel about the Napoleonic Wars. I thought this novel was cute, unique, and creative. It was different, and that is one thing I admired about the work. Naomi Novik used historical events, and mixed a tamer form of our fantasy dragon in one book. Sort of like How To Tame A Dragon, but with the idea that dragons are like domesticated dogs. At the end of the day I just wanted a dragon to ride around. I would get to so many places quicker. The other part I liked were the ideas of Natural and Artificial Selection. Science! Evolution! I am assuming, at one point there were tamer dragons, and wilder dragons, which the humans took advantage of the tamer ones for their own benefit. Honesty, I would of loved to know the backstory of how humans rode dragons. Was there one or a few guys who became friends with a nicer breed of dragons? What is the history? Then eventually, through Artificial Selection, humans started breeding between different types of dragons to give certain attributes to the next generation, such as fire, acid, intelligence, etc. Cool, right? I love it. The main character, Lawrence, was an intelligent, courageous, noble gentleman. Temeraire, the main dragon, was the same as Lawrence. I can see how these characters can annoy, and tire some people, because they have the best attributes of a human and dragon, and you wonder what is their flaw. They cannot surely be the best, of the best, of the best! That isn't human. I liked them, especially for their noble attributes, but I am waiting for them to relax. The other characters had flaws, some where evil, and dragons had their own personalities and qualities that gave a nice mixture to the overall story.His Majesty's Dragon was a light read, and easy to follow. Naomi Novik gives the ground work in this novel, by showing the reader the hatching, the training, the different types of dragons, personalities of dragons, and the war. There were a few exciting moments, but I was expecting more brutality. I was kind of disappointed that there wasn't more ferocious battles. There were some sad, and angry moments, but I just wanted a little more crushing of skulls. I will read the next book in the series to see if it may become more brutal. They are dragons of course, and some natural, wild instinct is sure to come in.  His Majesty's Dragon  overall is a cute, unique book that was enjoyable.

First, I've read lots of \"dragon books\", and this is far, far from the best. For one thing, I'm a physicist and while I'm willing to suspend disbelief up to a certain point, the image of dragons capable of carrying anywhere from tens to hundreds of humans at a time (plus weapons and armor!) for distances that again range from tens to hundreds of miles in a day just does not compute. Let me count the ways it violates natural law, not just by a little bit but ludicrously: energy conservation, scaling laws, biology -- you name it, her dragons violate it. Her dragons carry loads like 747 airliners carry loads -- to carry the load described in the last book of this series, where Temeraire helps ferry people over a hundred at a time from a fort out to a boat, well -- imagine hanging 100 people from an elephant. Hmmm, no way. A brachiosaurus? Sorry, I can't imagine more than 30 or 40. A blue whale? Now we're talking.100 humans at 200 pounds each is an easy 10 tons of humans. Add this to the (conservatively) 100 ton body mass of an animal large enough to hang all these people on and you're talking the good sized airliner, all supposedly powered by muscles on the fuel of the energy content of an occassional cow. Waste heat alone would cook such a beast until it starved to death, assuming of course that they weren't crushed under their own weight as they attempted to stand. Okay, you say. We know dragons aren't real, so why can't they be whatever she likes? They can, of course, but even my 12 year old thought that it was a bit odd and hard to believe. And it's not that I don't like dragons. McCaffery's dragons are close enough that I can suspend disbelief -- Pern's gravity is lower, air is maybe thicker, they're hollow bodied and don't have to carry huge loads, just a person and saddle and load of firestone, which (for all I know) is a light and porous rock or the dragons couldn't chew it. Battledragons are also believable -- basically smallish dinosaurs in armor who like noodles as much as meat. One can go down a veritable list of dragons back to King Arthur, and never has their been a storybook dragon so very out of kilter with common sense.Once you get past this, the book is still flawed in several ways. Laurence (the main human protagonist) is a middling flawed individual -- priggish, filled with notions of duty and obligation, blind to his surroundings, out of touch with the real world, a supposedly \"romantic\" character that comes across looking more foolish than believable. He persists in referring to his (male) dragon as \"dear\" throughout the book. No man calls his male companions or pets (however you want to view the dragon) as \"dear\", and even viewing the dragon as his \"child\" it still sounds odd. Because he's a dodo-brain when it comes to politics he naturally gets into all sorts of scrapes that could easily be avoided, which gives the book a bit of stilted or contrived feel. Even the economics of dragons doesn't really compute -- at a good sized piece of livestock a day, dragons are remarkably expensive to feed (a cow takes months to years to grow and can feed a lot of humans). Yet we see dragons by the dozen being supported for their military potential, we see dragons \"making a living\" carrying messages or people around a city. Hell of a taxi service, if the taxi driver/cab combo earns enough to buy an entire cow a day.Given all of this, if you accept the series as being a simple historical \"what-if\" novel exploring the Napoleanic wars with dragons being used as a living \"air force\", it's a decent read. Worth it for exactly three novels, which unfortunately wasn't enough to get close to terminating the endless story.

This isn't fantasy, it's day dream. By far, the most amusing portion of the book is the conversations between Laurence (the protagonist) and Temeraire (the dragon)-amusing to the sheer ridiculousness of its romantic triteness.

The Gentleman\u2019s Guide to How to Train Your Dragon. Dragons! Who doesn\u2019t love dragons? GOT Season 7 is finally bringing theirs into action, and so I decided to read this \u2018old\u2019 (= 10 years) dragon book, which I enjoyed immensely. The writing may be a bit dense, but reading about Laurence raising a baby dragon from egg to powerful beast was a lot of fun.The plot is quite simple: we\u2019re talking about Europe during the 17th century, but dragons are alive and flying and mainly being used as powerful weapons in the war. After taking commando over a French ship, Navy Captain Will Laurence discovers that it was carrying aboard a dragon egg that\u2019s about to hatch. When it does, the dragon unfortunately imprints itself on Laurence, who now has to say goodbye to his old comfortable lifestyle to become a dragon trainer. If you don\u2019t see the problem here \u2013 me neither, because that job sounds AWESOME! And to be fair, Laurence doesn\u2019t cry about his new career for too long, because Temeraire is the most incredible and endearing dragon I\u2019ve met. He\u2019s a mix between a curious young kitten (who loves gold necklaces as much as a cat loves yarn), but hyper-intelligent at the same time. And after Laurence and Temeraire move to the training grounds in Scotland, the reader gets to meet many more dragons and trainers, who all make this story much more engaging and delightful. However, the setting and the writing-style can be an issue. As I said earlier the Napoleonic Wars provide the backdrop to this story, so a large part of the book is dedicated to talking about battle-strategies and the technical aspects of aerial training dragons. This information is interesting but a bit dull, and since we only get two real battle-scenes, some readers might find this book quite underwhelming when it comes to action.The writing-style is also pretty old-fashioned. Similar to the writing in the books of Jane Austen*, almost every person that we meet is wealthy, well mannered and speaks \u2018posh\u2019. Luckily though the writing never becomes too wooly: dragons like honesty more than being polite, which takes fancy Laurence some getting used to. ;) Because no matter the writing-style or the technical battle-plans: the relationship between Laurence and Temeraire's is easily the best part of this book. The way the two grow closer and mature, both separately and together, is well-build up and so touching. Next to that Novik has done an amazing job with the historical worldbuilding (you wouldn't think adding dragons to the Napoleonic Wars would work, but it does), so I\u2019m very excited to continue on with this series. Moar dragons, please! * = speaking about Jane Austen: do you know that on the fanfiction-website Archive of Our Own, you can find a lot of Temeraire/Persuasion or Temeraire/Pride & Prejudice crossovers? #NoShame guys, reading about Elizabeth Bennet on a dragon is a great way to spend your afternoon.Read here my other reviews of the Temeraire books:#2 Throne of Jade (upcoming)"}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "Buddy read with a few peeps at Buddies Books and Baubles starting Oct 9. 3.5 I want a baby Dragon starsI read Uprooted this year and it was one of my favorite books of the year so far so I thought I\u2019d give another Naomi Novak book a try. His Majesty\u2019s Dragon is an alternate history where Dragons are present and used in the warfare of the Napoleonic Wars like battleships would be. It is a really interesting concept and the writing is almost as good as Uprooted.Laurence has been a navy man and ship captain most of his life but when some unexpected loot from a French ship ends up being a dragon egg he is cast into role of rider to a new hatchling dragon and the life he thought he would have is now over.I was entertained by learning what it takes to raise a dragon and see how they are incorporated into society and warfare. It was different than I expected as Dragons are pretty sentient and can speak right out of the shell. I also didn\u2019t expect the unique relationship between rider and dragon. Sometimes they spoke to each other almost like a couple. While a little strange I did like the strong bound that formed between a Dragon and the Rider they chose at hatching.Not a lot happens in the actual plot. There is a lot of training and Laurence getting used to how different the Arial Force is from the Navy. First of all there are women riders which is a huge change from the life he lived before. Most of this story is the life of having a Dragon and what it entails. There are a few battles and some tense moments but for the most part it is a story of a boy and his dragon.Laurence is a bit stiff but it fits with the timeframe of the book and since he is English. I did want him to loosen up a bit more. Temeraire on the other hand is so obviously loyal to Laurence and pretty charming that he made the book all that more enjoyable for me.If you haven\u2019t read a Naomi Novak book yet I still say go with Uprooted first but she has a great writing style that can bring you into a new world and keep you there easily."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "A very engaging book, I read it in a few hours on a very cold Sunday afternoon & evening.

This is easily one of the best \"alternate history\" adventure books I've read.It's amazing how well Naomi Novik has integrated dragons into the arsenals of the various nations during the Napoleonic wars. As there have been plenty of works already written about that time period, including the well-known Aubrey-Maturin series by Patrick O'Brian, it's nice to have a fresh take on these familiar battles and characters (Trafalgar, Napoleon, Nelson, etc). In fact, everything is so well thought out and meticulously detailed that it's now hard to imagine dragons NOT being involved in these great historical battles.One of the greatest things about this book, and those that follow, is the fact that dragons aren't \"all powerful\". They have been bred to be specialists, and within their specialized roles they excel, but outside of that narrow scope they struggle. Most can\u2019t see in the dark, young dragons are prone to panic or overzealousness, and they are all susceptible to the muskets and cannons (and other dragons) of the time period. They are not \u201csuper\u201d weapons\u2026they are aerial assets that have to be used carefully and tactically. Aside from that, though, is the fact that they are also creatures who think and feel, and don\u2019t always agree with the rules and laws of the military they \u201cserve\u201d.Our protagonist, Captain William Laurence, is very much a man of his time. Born into some privilege, he is an officer and a gentleman through and through, with duty to King & Country coming before anything else. He reminds me very much of Captain Jack Aubrey from the O\u2019Brian books, in that he is singularly devoted to his service in His Majesty\u2019s military, with everything else in life being an ancillary thought. If the entire book had him this uptight, we\u2019d have been in for a rough ride. But once he and Temeraire are paired, he starts to open up, as the more \u201cprogressive\u201d leanings of his dragon start to take hold in his own heart and mind.As for Temeraire, he is just as fleshed out a character as Laurence, even if we don\u2019t get chapters expressly from his point of view. He is young, impulsive, and marveled by the world in which he was hatched. With his inquisitive nature, natural rebelliousness, and disdain for useless rules, he is the perfect foil to Captain Laurence\u2019s stiff upper lip upbringing. They are such a fantastic team that they could easily carry the book by themselves. Fortunately, there are plenty of supporting characters who are also colorful and well thought out, which help broaden the strokes of the story even more. The less said about them the better though, as there are some conflicts and revelations best left unspoiled to new readers.There\u2019s quite a bit of technical descriptions thrown about in these books, but Naomi Novik writes in such a way that it never becomes cumbersome or confusing. The sea and air battles are handled with amazing flair, and the vernacular of the time is spot on (and also used in a way that the meaning is conveyed, even if the word may not be known to our modern minds). So much happens on these pages, that it sometimes feels like the book should be more pages than it is. So yeah, shame on me for rating it so low from my first read through. I enjoyed it so much that it\u2019s easily a 4 star read, maybe even rounded up to 4.5 stars.

And it looks more or less like this:The story will keep you glued to the seat till you reach the end and leave you wanting for more.It all starts with Navy captain Will Laurence discovering an unhatched dragon egg on board of a captured French frigate. As dragons are extremely valuable creatures, they have to be harnessed as soon as they hatch. And as fate will have it, despite his love for the navy and reluctance to join the despised Aerial Corps, Lawrence ends up being chosen by the dragon as his handler and has his whole life irrevocably turned upside down. Temeraire, as Lawrence chooses to name him, is a wonderful creature that caught my heart from the very first moment he hatched. His charming personality and his gentleness slowly turn Lawrence\u2019s resentment toward him into a genuine affection that further develops into a bond so strong that neither would be happy without the other.Together, Lawrence and Temeraire join the Aerial Corps and learn how to fly alongside other dragons and riders in aerial battles to repel the French invasion.The dragons are brilliant! Their personalities differ just as those of humans. The kindness a huge 10 ton beast displays towards a simpler one of his kind makes you want to be a better person yourself. The gentleness and care they have towards their riders is so sweet! The unconditional love between rider and dragon makes you all warm and fuzzy inside.And the riders themselves, Novik made them so wonderfully human that you can easily pick one or the other to identify with. They are all faulty but still good, with certain exceptions of course. Lawrence is by far my favourite with his old-school ways and manners: a gentleman through and through!The descriptions of different breeds and their characteristics are exceptional, the author making it very clear how every type of dragon looks so you can even picture them while reading. I have to admit I had some problems understanding the battle rigging so I checked it out. For those of you who\u2019ve also wondered, this is how it should go:The aerial battle scenes were brilliant. Extremely detailed and on the point, they were masterfully rendered. Not every author would be able to pull something like that off. Novik made me see how the dragons move, how they turn or twist or hover and even made my heart stop for a little while expecting Temeraire to be hit. I found it pretty easy to imagine Lily\u2019s formation and follow her through drills and action.I can safely say this is one of the finest books I ever read. The writing style is wonderful! The plot original! And the dragons fantastic! If the sequels are just the same, it will be one of my top 5 favourite series. If you love dragons or sweet reads that make you feel mushy, this is just the book for you! I highly recommend it.Buddy read with the Dragon Corps from FBR."}, {"userName": "Gar", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188437-gar", "userReview": "Something neat about the Kindle e-book device is that there's a number of free books on it, generally the first book of a series or whatnot. That's pretty good. So the good thing was, this was free. Also, the writing wasn't wretched.Anyway, it's the story of Captain Mary Sue of the Royal Navy who happens to capture a dragon egg from the French right before it hatches, and as luck would have it, the Mary Sue dragon who hatches is totally and completely going to only bond with him. Dragons hatch fully able to speak and comprehend languages, you see, and reach their full growth in weeks. Also the bond between dragon and rider is the bestest and most truest and most wonderful bond possible. Captain Mary Sue calls Dragon Mary Sue \"my dear\" and \"darling\" throughout, and prefers sleeping cuddled up with his dragon, and they have long talks and he reads to him, and it's OH SO WONDERFUL. And dragons are just like people, really, so there's never any sense of two intelligences who are actually alien to one another at a fundamental level communicating because the dragon and rider bond transcends that in its love and friendship and loyalty, except for one dragon rider, he's a BAD one, he treats his dragon BADLY and then his dragon DIES and Captain Mary Sue forces him to at least fake affection because all that poor dragon wanted was his LOVE, and Captain Mary Sue is a hero because he refrained from hurting the bad bad dragon rider, and everyone approves because they all understand how pure and good the dragon bond is, and it's such a terrible and tragic shame about that one guy. Everyone's sad but it's okay because Captain Mary Sue and Dragon Mary Sue can comfort each other and feel better.Oh oh oh! And Dragon Mary Sue isn't just any dragon, he's the BEST DRAGON IN THE WORLD! He was brought all the way from CHINA, and he's CELESTIAL! He's BIG, but ever so NIMBLE and BEAUTIFUL! He can do things like turn on a dime and hover in place, which the other dragons can't do. It's not that the other dragons are bad dragons, but they're just not THE BEST DRAGON IN THE WORLD like Dragon Mary Sue is, and Dragon Mary Sue is a little bit sad at first because he can't breathe fire or acid like other dragons can, and maybe that means he's not the very bestest dragon in all the world, but that's OKAY, because in the end, do you know what happens? Oh squee, it turns out he can ROAR with such brave strong FORCE that it's like a shockwave, and it SAVES EVERYONE! Everyone already knew Captain Mary Sue and Dragon Mary Sue were so awesome, but now they know it even more! And there's TWO WHOLE MORE BOOKS I could get, too! Could the BEST DRAGON IN THE WORLD get even MORE BESTEST?!?!I'll never know."}, {"userName": "Ashley *Hufflepuff Kitten*", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29787548-ashley-hufflepuff-kitten", "userReview": "[and I would love to see Hollin with his own dragon (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "I am a little surprised by how much I liked this.

The Eragon craze was in full swing, and everybody but me was raving about the book, it seemed. I have had a fascination with dragons ever since I watched Dragonheart (which made me cry like a baby!). Paolini's immature rendition of a draconian 'plaything' made me crave some decent writing. A friend recommended the Temeraire series, and it was the biggest favour he's ever done me, then or since. Sometimes when I re-read books that I read a long time ago, I find myself losing interest. One of the sad/good things about growing up is that you're more critical and less accepting of flights of fancy, let's say. So while my teenage self thought The Princess Diaries was the coolest thing to happen to YA fiction, my adult self gets pretty damn tired of her self-involved babbling. And don't even get me started on the then vs. now of Enid Blyton's books. But thankfully, the magic of His Majesty's Dragon has not faded. I find that I am still as touched and amused by the relationship between Laurence and Temeraire as I ever was. If you've been living in Siberia, and don't know what this book is about, it's an alternative history/historical fantasy set in the Napoleonic era. The war between Britain and France is being fought, with dragons in the fray. SO when Navy captain Will Laurence captures a French frigate and discovers an unusual egg, it is cause for celebration. Not for long, however. En route to Madeira, the egg hatches, and the dragonet forms a bond with Laurence, hitherto a career Navy man. Leaving behind all that he knows, Laurence sets off with his dragon, Temeraire to enter the new world of the aviators, those mysterious group of dragon handlers. Watching the bond develop between Laurence and Temeraire is a little like a love story, except then it'll be bestiality, so ew, definitely not! Maybe the start of a beautiful friendship, then. Laurence is at first distressed about leaving all that he knows and values, but gradually, his affection for Temeraire and respect for the dragon's intelligence grows, until he cannot bear to be separated from the creature who has become his best friend. I love Naomi Novik's writing. Her characterisations are authentic, and as someone who is a little bit of a Regency freak (no, I don't mean I read a lot of Georgette Heyer, although there is that too!) I know that she's really made an effort to research her history, customs, language, military data, etc. There are some inconsistencies that crop up, but I'll let her get away with it in the name of Art. Will is adorable as the stuffed shirt who eventually unbends, but it is not he that makes the series. It is, completely and totally, from the first book to the sixth, thus far, Temeraire who is the heart and soul of the story. He grows from the first book, where one tends to think of him as a fascinating, amusing, sort-of pet into a thinking, growing person in his own right, with opinions and quirks, until by the sixth book, he's just like a man on four legs. Although that would probably be something of an insult to a dragon. And it's not just Laurence and Temeraire who are likeable in this book. Despite a sad lack of page-time, I also fell in love with the relationship between Maximus and Berkely, and found myself blubbering in incoherent rage over Rankin's treatment of his dragon. I really, really, empathised with the characters and the storyline, even the second time around, which is saying a lot for the adult, newly-picky version of moi. I cannot recommend HMD and the rest of the series enough. If you're the kind of person who isn't entirely comfortable with the slightly long-winded modes of speech of Georgian and Regency England, you may find some parts of the story hard going, but if you persist, it's totally worth it. I. Love. This.

I must say, I was a little hesitant to dive into another Naomi Novik book after really not loving Uprooted, but I was very happily surprised by this book and I will certainly carry the series on. This story follows a young man called Lawrence who is a Navy Captain. He's earned his rank for service to the crown and he's proud of where he's got without much family help. One day he and his crew take the cargo from a rival French ship they capture and on board they find a dragon egg near to hatching. When this egg does indeed hatch no one knows the dragon's breed, but it takes a liking to Lawrence and from then on the course of his life shifts far from what he had anticipated...What I most loved about this was that Temeraire (the dragon) was sentient and intelligent and filled with personality. I loved seeing Temeraire's inquisitive nature come out, and the bond he formed with Lawrence over the course of just this one book was really lovely. I don't doubt that this will just continue as the series goes on, and I am looking forward to it.My only complaint is that I'm not hugely interested in the Napoleonic wars which is the back drop for this series and so some of the tactics weren't all that interesting to me, but as a story this worked well. I do think this has a lot of potential and with the addition of some more unusual or unexpected plot points and some more lyrical writing I could see this series becoming a favourite.

He was tired after a long day of flight training and eager to sleep, but he sensed Temeraire's energy and knew his companion had something to say. 'How did you like the book?' Laurence asked.'I enjoyed it.' Temeraire said 'I liked the dragons and the people. They all felt real and comfortable... when we got to know them.''But perhaps we didn't always get to know them?' Laurence asked as he closed his eyes and leaned into Tereraire's warm flank.'Well, the story just hopped around so much.' Temeraire said and raised his head, sleep forgotten. 'They were on the ship and we were getting to know how that worked and who the sailors were. And I was very keen to know all about that and how they were going to feed the dragon on such a long journey. But then that ended and we were in British society and the captain was dealing with his old family and friends; seeing whether they'd accept him now that he wasn't a ship captain anymore, and those people were interesting and I wanted to get to know them but then that ended and they were rushed off to the dragon school.''And how did you like the dragon school?' Laurence asked, amused but impressed at how seriously Temeraire was analyzing a story he himself had treated as a lark.'I liked that. They stayed at the school a while and we really got to know the dragons and the people there. Not everyone got along but they didn't fight over nothing like in some stories where there's lives at stake every three pages. It felt like a group of real people I'd like to meet.' Temeraire paused. 'Too bad about the actual training, I didn't find it as interesting as the navy or English society. How much is there to a dragon flying?''And what about the ending? The battle and all?' Laurence asked. His mind was drifting off.'Oh, all that stuff, it was just like all those other stories. The surprising stuff, or the stuff that was supposed to be surprising; the traitor and Napoleon's plan and how they almost lost but then they won. I knew what was coming and felt like...'

If you like historical fantasy at all, you\u2019re almost certain to enjoy this book.Will Laurence is a captain in His Majesty\u2019s Navy at the time of the Napoleonic Wars, and it looks a lot like the Navy you\u2019d see in a Patrick O\u2019Brien book--all protocol and taking enemy ships for profit--until his ship captures a precious dragon egg and Laurence is sent off the Aerial Corps to be captain of the dragon instead. Dragons here are essentially flying, talking ships, which makes for some entertaining battle scenes and opens up room for an imaginative alternate world.The plot is entertaining--not action-packed: there\u2019s a lot of training, and a lot about Laurence\u2019s adjustment to the Aerial Corps, which is much more casual and modern than he\u2019s used to (there are even *gasp* women in it!)--but fun; I was rooting for Laurence and his dragon, Temeraire, and enjoyed the story throughout. The characters are vivid and interesting, and I especially enjoyed Laurence\u2019s struggle to adjust and the conflict between his respect for hierarchy and his discomfort with some of the ways things are done in the Corps. Creating such a stiff and formal protagonist is a risk, but Laurence works because at the same time he\u2019s good-hearted and willing to adapt. Temeraire is also entertaining, breaking the typical dragon-companion mold (he likes books, for instance), and he manages not to come across as a animal-companion wish-fulfillment fantasy, which is rare in this sort of book. I\u2019ve read comments indicating there\u2019s a lot of romance in the book, which baffle me--there isn\u2019t, at least not in the sexual sense; the growing friendship between Laurence and Temeraire is at the heart of the story. Laurence\u2019s apparent love interest is awesome, though, and I\u2019d love to see more of her in future books.Otherwise, the writing is good, the period details convincing and the fantasy elements well-integrated into the historical setting. Novik\u2019s style hints at 19th century writing, while still being easy going for the modern reader. The secondary characters are endearing or obnoxious as the author intended, and feel real enough to set them apart from the typical fantasy extras. And Novik manages a modern, critical look at the British Empire without Laurence\u2019s ever breaking character; he\u2019s unthinkingly loyal, even while the narrative questions that devotion. Really, there\u2019s no downside here, unless you\u2019re leery of starting a long and unfinished series. But while there seem to be some long-running threads introduced (Laurence\u2019s relationship with his father, for one), the book works well as a standalone.This isn\u2019t great literature, and I don\u2019t expect to read it again. But I do intend to read the sequel, and I recommend this one to anyone looking for fun, high-quality fantasy.UPDATE: I read most of the sequel and found it boring as hell, so for me the series ends here. This doesn't affect my recommendation of this one, though."}, {"userName": "Jaya", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31691644-jaya", "userReview": "An endearing Dragon!
