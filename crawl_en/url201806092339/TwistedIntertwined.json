So when I started I was excited to hear how it would be end and how it all would end... But when I came to the last 100 pages I was getting worried that she could not leave me like this and how the heck the story could end in only 100 pages.. When I read the last page I knew it... and I was relieved and angry at the same time. Relieved because I get more story and that I can spend more time with Aden, Vic, Mary Ann and.. *sigh* Riley. And of course angry because I thought it would all come to an end... Twisted starts right after what happened at the end of the last book and It was a bit disturbing, very dark and twisted. It took me some time to get hold on what it's going on right now and I'm still slightly confused but it was nonetheless important for what happens afterwards.. Aden has changed. Very much so and I LOVE this new an improved Aden so sooo much! He's becoming the king of Vampires he was always intended to be and he's now a darker and stronger version of himself. Sometimes blinded and detached from himself but still Aden .... And I love him so so much more now .. ( and I DID love him already right from the beginning )  Whatever happens to Aden also happens to Victoria in a reverse way. I was never a fan of her, I didn't like her at all I have to admit, now seeing her changing I finally begin to like her. She's more human and looses her coldness and strange attitude. She's so protective of Aden that I now cannot help but like her and see finally what Aden saw in her right from the beginning..But my favorite couple is Mary Ann and Riley! In the last book Mary Ann run away from Riley to protect him from her and Riley was - to say it mildy - pissed about this! But although she leaves she cannot help herself and researches Aden's past, she loves him like a brother and would do anything to help him. Which is why she teamed up with ... (no I won't tell, but it's a very surprising twist)But Riley wouldn't be Riley if he wouldn't come for her and this is what I love most about him. He's the male alpha wolf that is very protective and very possessive and ..gosh he's hot!!!!! But their relation is insecure, they both don't know how to be together although there are so many sparks between them.....The story is very action packed and never never boring, the story has a great pace and leaves you on edge the whole time. And.. many things will happen that will leave you angry and crying in frustration. I love the dynamic between those two couples and I think the characters are my most fav part of this series. But also the world building and the plotline is absolutely captivating!! Very rich and full of twists, turns and surprises. The end however is horrible and left me hanging and crying out in frustration! If you haven't start the series yet, please do so - I LOVE it! the first book was brilliant, the second was good and now the third again brilliant! I love you Gena Showalter for giving me Aden, Vic, Mary Ann and... Riley!!! More please!"}, {"userName": "kari", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2207055-kari", "userReview": "Blood. Blood.  Blood. Blood. BLOOD. BLOOD. BLOOD! That is all Aden pretty much thinks about the majority of this book. Victoria's blood in particular, but again, blood in general. The first chapter is he wants her blood, she wants his blood, he drinks from her, she drinks from him, he wants to drain her, she wants to drain him, they beat the stuffing out of each other. Nice, huh? I wasn't sure I wanted to continue and wish I hadn't done so. There is nothing here that I enjoyed or appreciated, even brief moments. Nothing.Aden spends most of the first half of the book shirtless, stomping around the vampire castle, glaring, giving terse answers, being unfeeling. His vampire powers develops as Victoria's powers diminish and cease. She has somehow turned Aden into a vampire, something which can't be done or hasn't been able to be done for centuries, but she did it. How? Who knows? Will we get an answer to that? Nope, so don't bother to look for one.Mary Anne has run from everyone to try to find some answers and save all her friends from her draining ability. Rily finds her and they get shot by witches, almost dying. Riley force feeds her his wolf ability to save her life, losing his wolf ability and when she recovers her draining seems to have ended. Why? Will we get an answer to that? Nope.The ranch where Aden and his friends lived is burned to the ground, killling one of the boys. Another of the boys set the fire while compelled by the not-quite-dead Vlad, Victoria's father. That boy also kills Shannon for no apparent reason. But sadly, Shannon is then brought back due to Aden's (through Julian) ability to raise the dead. Don't worry about that because they are in the vampire mansion when it is burned to the ground, likely killing everyone there. We do get to find out in the final chapters that Rily and Victoria have slept together in the past, detracting from their romances with Aden and Mary Anne. Why was this even in here? I guess to make it okay when they all part? I don't know. Everyone ends up in a bad place; dark, dismal, sad, hopeless.Do you know the movie \"It's a Wonderful Life\"? George finds out that all these people's lives, his whole town actually and the lives of hundreds of people he's never met, are better because of him, are better simply because of his own life, however humble and disappointing it sometimes is. Now, you are saying, why are you bringing that up? Well, because this story about Aden is the exact opposite. He makes all the lives of everyone he comes into contact with awful, probably much worse than they would be if he had never met them. He ruins everything around him, not purposfully, but it still happens. Nice, huh?But the real kicker to all of this, the ultimate insult to me as a reader, the pinacle of this mess is at the end, when the whole thing has turned into an absolute pile of wreckage, Aden will travel back in time changing and erasing all of it, back to the day he first met Mary Anne or putting it another way, back to page one of the first book in this series.I give book-selling props to Showalter, but I truly hate this ending. So, I've read three books for a total of nothing? Really? Now she gets to start over and tell a completely different story? Really? How about just showing up and punching me in the face? That is how I feel. Gotcha! If only I could time travel back to when I began this series and skip the whole thing. Sounds fair."}, {"userName": "Kayls", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5898980-kayls", "userReview": "Are you F-ing kidding me. OKay so first things first. Aden is no longer Aden. He's a cold blooded son of a bitch that at the end of the story decides to go back and change everything? like are you kidding me? Second, the only reason i read this series was because i liked Riley and Marry Ann but at the end i couldn't even tell if they were together. Third, Riley and Victoria sleeping together was a pointless thing to bring up because all it did was cause the character's dignity to fall into a big black useless hole because it was a totally unnecessary twist. Also Killing a bunch of people (i.e. Shannon) was also unnecessary. Gena Showalter was one of my favorite authors. I loved her characters in the first two books and her Lords of the Underworld series is one of my favorites but seriously this book was not a good thing. The only reason i will read the next one is to see how everything turns out. However she is writing a spinoff series about Riley's brothers, Maxwell and Nathan, and i loved those boys and their curses so maybe we can be hopeful about that"}, {"userName": "Aimee", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3914805-aimee", "userReview": "Twisted is one amazing story! It had my mind whirling with all the events that happened in such a short time. It's the third book in the Intertwined novel and it definitely isn't winding down to a stop, instead it's getting to full speed. This is one of the better YA series I have read in such a long time.I can't express how much I love the premise behind this series. I love the souls trapped in Aden's head and I love the new family he's formed with Riley, Victoria and Mary Ann. Such a great dynamic that leaves room for just about anything and everything to happen to the four as they try to help Aden along his journey.It's so hard not to give spoilers, but in this my heart was aching with Mary Ann. She has a tough time in this novel, especially the end, and I kept rooting for things to finally go her way. I admit, in previous novels, I didn't care for her too much, but she's grown on me and in this I have found I really do care for her. She's such an essential part to the group that the story would have been missing something. The ending definitely leaves off like the rest, with an abrupt ending that leaves people wanting more, leaving a thread of storyline to clue us as to the possibilities of the next book. I was breathless when I finished the book, hands sore from gripping the pages as I read on, only to be left such an ending that begs for more. Definitely one of the best young adult novels I've read in a long time.

But the thing is, it actually went along with the story! He was fighting the inner turmoil of his ever growing beast and the past emotions of Victoria. Through the story we see the change in Aden as he fights the changes within himself and turns back again into the character that we all love, By the end of the story I was happy that he had turned back into his old self. While I do have to admit that the plot and characters of Riley and Mary Ann were neglected a bit. Despite this there was such an emphasis on my favorite relationship in the book (Aden and Victoria) that I was happy and did not mind the neglect on the other pair. The ending still has me on a numbness of mind. I cannot wait for the next book and it has to be here like....

It's like... good good good couple ups and downs twists and turns, nothing we as readers can't handle then BOOM everything basically goes to shit :/ The only reason this is getting 2 is because of the previous 2 books and my hopes that the final one will redeem this big massive waste of trees .... Well ... to be perfectly honest there's not much I can review about this book seeing as how I skipped past most of it... but anyways maybe I'll just list out what I disliked and TRY to list out that I liked...Dislike:1. The fact that Riley and Victoria slept together... that entire thing I hated... firstly the fact that it happened at all, secondly the fact that it was basically forgotten about by everyone 2 seconds later like I genuinely expected Mary Anne to be slightly more depressed over that?2. The fact that Shannon died... I mean come on him and Ryder could've been something cute but thats totally gone now... 3. The lack of cutesy moments between Riley and Mary Anne... first time in the series we have Riley's POV and there's just a big fat ball of nothing. I mean this is fiction for christ sake... I don't want to hear normal lad reactions to stuff I want boy's to day dream over! Riley was one of them until he went all cold and self deprecating like please GROW UP AND GET YOUR WOMEN! 4. I used to love how Victoria was so strong with all these powers and stuff because I just in general love strong female leads... now she's weak and unconfident in herself and just blah... Aden is the strong powerful one now like... could you not let the girls have something... ANYTHING! Instead we've got one whose gone from indestructible to just... grand and another whose a \"drainer\" (never liked that either... wish she was a fairy or something remotely cool and positive sounding) and perilously close to falling down a never ending pit of depression... while all the lads make their important decisions for them! 5. The ending... like how the hell is this going to go now :/ and if I wait a year for this series and don't get some cute Riley and Mary Anne stuff I'm gonne be piiiiiiiiiissed!Really I can't believe this is going to happen... I mean the amount of growth each character has done in the past two books and in the this one is just wiped out... Eveyone is just back to the way they were before it's so pointless it makes me mad!

The first book,  Intertwined was freaking AMAZING (Yep, all caps amazing) and the second book  Unraveled literally left me speechless because I could NOT believe a second book of a series KILL the first book and shredded it to pieces. Both books made my all-time-bests list  BUT.... This one did not. \nThings that pissed me off:\n1. Aden. I was in love with this kid. Like true (I really wish he was real so, I could date/kiss him)love. But sadly, he messed up the story for me. Honestly, he was a COMPLETE jackass to me. I don't know if it was because Choppers was in him or what but I don't know how Victoria dealt with him because I would have smashed a bat against his head after awhile of his bullshit.I was so \naggravated\n with him that whenever his stupid POV would come, I would skip it. I know that means I basically skipped like half the book but I still got the main point of the book.2. Did Riley and Mary Ann get back together? I honestly don't know because one minute, they were being all couple like and then Mary Ann would mention that they weren't dating and then the next minute, they would argue. I officially love Riley more than Aden now  GASP! I know I'm shocked too. Back to Aden again, I honestly love the cute boy appeal of him. He wasn't a jerk or a stupid jock who girls fell for because they were rude. Victoria fell for him because he was sweet and just ADORABLE! What happened to that adorable-ness?PLEASE GENA, explain what you did to Aden!

If you're looking for a continuation of all the wonderful things happening in the first two installments of this series, than be prepared to get nowhere fast. Normally I write a brief summary of the book and then an evaluation but I am truly at a loss for a real concrete storyline. Yeah Aden got somewhere with the souls in his head but Showalter spent a majority of the book on Aden's new alter ego and complete character reversals for our two main couples. Everyone changed so drastically so fast that I found myself wondering who are these people and where did the wonderful characters I loved so much go? When I first picked up Intertwined I was blown away, I mean vampires, werewolves, witches, necromancy, a couple of interesting wildcard paranormals and two love stories, this book has everything I love about the genre. I invested in this intriguing story and got involved with these characters. I looked forward to the continuation of these books every long year. And now I feel like the author just trashed everything I invested in. I think Gena Showalter is the truly twisted one here. To wait a year for a book that makes me think even the author wasn't happy with the direction so she went completely insane with the characters, extra light on the storyline, and destroyed everything just so she could have a do over. This book is about 98% filler. I get the idea of Twisted, but with a weak storyline and without the anchor of the characters and romances the fans have grown to like it became muddled and confusing at times. Showalter let go of everything all at once so it was hard to hold on to the bits and pieces I came back for. Just when I find a familiar character or relationship, it's pulled out from under me and I'm left flailing for some point of interest. Twisted was executed poorly and was an unnervingly drastic change from the previous books. I wish the author would have just kept the important parts, left out the weird character developments, and moved on with the story."}, {"userName": "Deea (Andreea)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3017446-deea-andreea", "userReview": "OH NO!

It's five stars because I find the book highly addicting and really enjoy Gena's writing. That being said, looking back on this book and knowing that there's no final book...it really doesn't deserve the five star rating (in my opinion). I will keep it at it's five stars, but I will give an updated more recent (like 7-8 years later?) post-rating since I'm going through this book again.Positives:1. This book is a lot darker than the previous two, which helped make this series pop out and become more addicting in my mind.2. Epic cover. What can I say? Sometimes you DO judge a book by it's cover. 3. The sudden changes in the characters are both a positive and a negative. I liked the changes, it made some of the characters more likable and it developed their characters. But...the rest is said in the negatives. Of course, there's a \"but...\".4. This book is action packed, and is definitely one of Gena's best series. It moves fast enough to keep me interested.5. I love the couple pairings in this series. This book doesn't disappoint for expanding on these relationships and make them more addicting.Negatives:1. Our characters personalities seem to have randomly changed in this book. It didn't follow as smoothly to the second book as the second did to the first. I would have loved a final book to explain why this happened...2. Cancelled series. Yup - if you aren't happy with cliffhangers, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK. If I would have known, I probably wouldn't have read this series. I absolutely HATE books that end in cliffhangers or where plots are never resolved.3. The ending. The positives and the negatives are pretty even for this series, to be brutally honest. It's a great read for someone who wants to get into Gena's writing and see the different sides of her that aren't just her giant Lords of the Underworld series. I would suggest this to those who want a quality YA read!!!My new rating would be closer to 3.5, especially since Gena never even gave a hint to what the ending would be (since the next book is apparently \"never\" coming out, and it looks like a literal never at this point)."}, {"userName": "Micah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6441299-micah", "userReview": "So basically take what I like about the Story(Riley and Mary Ann) and make me hate it.and take what I loathe about the Story(Aden/Victoria) and make me hate it more.Like Unraveled, the story works best when the Story is not focusing on the Leads(Aden/Victoria).Characters like the ones at the Halfway house, The Vampires at Victoria's home, Tucker, Soren,and to a lesser extent Riley and Mary Ann interest me. I like the storylines of all these charactersVictoria's character is RUINED. She was annoying as a Vampire as she seemed to be weak then...then Gena goes and makes her Human which definitely makes her weak. I did like how Aden seemed to be very cold towards Victoria in the beginning. I was hoping he was going to stay that way the entire book but then he went right back to nearly worshiping her everything and now a human Victoria is worshiping his everything.I did like the introduction to Soren and I was hoping for more with this plotline but it was over as soon as it began as you know Aden was going to win...Seriously, Gena...make it more suspenseful next time. Aden also makes to shocking discoveries about one of the voices, Julian's past, as well as his own past and that was pretty entertaining.This book series is a series I read for Riley and Mary ann but even these 2 are seemingly losing what made them unique and are treading the annoying line that Aden/Victoria crossed in Unraveled. When Aden discovered Riley was the one who took Victoria's virginity...he was mad all of 3 pages and she got hurt and he was not mad anymore.

He was so shattered by the book that he insisted I read it immediately so that we could discuss it. That should give you a hint of the upheaval in this book...there is a LOT of it.This is an amazing series and it needs to be read as a series. These are not stand-alone books in my opinion. There is too much story that continues to build upon itself. This is book #3 in a series that is supposed to end with the next book. How in the world it is going to end, I have no idea. Quite honestly, I don't think Gena knows how it is going to end at this point. Every book, she talks about how hard they are to write, but that effort is evident in the quality of the books, because they are very good!There are a core of four characters that flow throughout the series. *Aden- he was born with the souls of 4 other people living within his brain. He is 16 and throughout the series, he is trying to release those souls although they have been like his parents to him his entire life. He was raised in the foster system and spent most of his life in and out of institutions because of the souls and the prevailing thought that he is schizophrenic.*Victoria- vampire princess and Aden's love interest. She goes through such a huge transition throughout this book as a person and vampire.*Riley- wolf shifter and bodyguard for Victoria. His transition throughout this book was the most heart-breaking to me. I just hope that something changes for him in the next book. He is involved with MaryAnne.*MaryAnne- human that is somehow connected to Aden. They were born the same day and when they met, it set off a chain of events that set off the entire series. At the end of this novel, she is in a very bad place...at least headed there. Things are not looking well for MaryAnne...thinking positive thoughts for book #4.*Tucker- MaryAnne's ex-boyfriend and half-demon. He is in such a Catch 22. His story breaks my heart all the way around and I really did not like where it went in this book. Not sure that anything can change, but am still hoping for book #4.This book really didn't end well for any of the characters. I can deal with that, BUT OMG, the next book isn't supposed to be out until June, 2013!?!?! I am not sure that I can deal with that. I think that I am going to have to go live with Gena while she is writing to make sure that she settles everything correctly for these characters that I have grown to love."}, {"userName": "Kristi-The Book Faery", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4387706-kristi-the-book-faery", "userReview": "Gena Showalter did not disappoint in this third installment of The Intertwined Series! Our Aden has come so far from the sad boy who just wants to fit in somewhere and be able to stay there for more than a month. This is a series that really needs to be read in order to fully appreciate the journey Adens been on and how far he's come. Aden has/had 4 souls in his mind that most Psychiatrists attribute to Schizophrenia but what they don't know is that each of those souls has a unique supernatural ability and they've been with Aden since birth, such as the ability to raise the dead, to see the future, etc... you get the picture. His life has been a living hell of abusive mental institutions and foster care homes until he meets Dan, an ex-football player who lives on a ranch with his wife and truly has the heart to help troubled teens. He takes a chance on Aden and is with us throughout the entire series.Twisted is focused primarily on Aden and Victoria's romance-it is much darker than the two novels before it which I found kept things at a really exciting pace and I wasn't quite sure what to expect from Aden, again, adding a factor of 'What's going to happen next' which I loved! Aden is fighting for his life and his love while undergoing changes that bring out the darker side of his nature while Victoria is undergoing the exact opposite-it's truly amazing and kept me on the edge of my seat!MaryAnne and Riley (Grrrr....now there's a hunka' burnin' love for ya!) are working on their own issues. MaryAnne is a drainer, meaning she drains all supernaturals of their strength-to the point that she doesn't require food anymore. The Witches and Faeries want her dead along with Aden and the death spell still hangs over their heads. So much going on!I love the plot, plot twists and the characters of this series! I am never let down and find myself caring for the characters like friends and I'm never ceased to be amazed by Gena's plot twists-she's brilliant!The Faery says READ THIS SERIES!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer K Jovus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4133765-jennifer-k-jovus", "userReview": "Twisted is the perfect title for this book. Gena Showalter has literally twisted the world that Aiden lives in leaving me feeling lost, confused and a little peeved at the ending. One of the reasons I have enjoyed the series so much is because the characters are genuine. It was Victoria\u2019s tenacity, Aiden\u2019s selfless humanity, Maryann's Sincerity and Riley\u2019s fierce loyalty that originally drew me deeper and deeper into the story. Twisted breaks these characters and finds them stripped of all they trust and fight for. For those of you that have read the first two books Intertwined and Unraveled, I would wait to read Twisted until the final book is released (untitled June 2012). Gena Showalter is a very talented author and I am certain has an incredible and shocking ending to the series planned. One that will make me want to read Twisted again because it will make more sense. I am certain Twisted is an emotional set up for book four. I gave Twisted three skullies because I am invested in the series and I have faith that it will all make sense when I read the 4th book. What I did like was seeing the characters more subdued personality traits surface. Maryann is actually a little smart mouth and it was kind of funny. The other positive aspect of this book was finally meeting Victoria's brother."}, {"userName": "Akelah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2218263-akelah", "userReview": "Not that I don't love this series, I really do but...She messed everything up! It saddens me that Aden changed from this great guy to an evil jerk. And that whole thing with Riley and Victoria kind of irritated me; we all know they might have had a relationship at one time or another, but it's done and over with!Meanwhile, all the stuff with Mary Ann... and Riley... ahhhh! Why did she do that to Shannon?!!! I loved him, he was an awesome minor character and she did that to him...Although the majority of the story made me sad or pissed me off, I did enjoy certain parts, like the introduction of Victoria's brother... and the part where they had to duel, and all the boys from the halfway house were there and Aden won. \"Who's doing the gay foreplay now?\" or something like that, I thought it was a good part... And even though Aden became a vampire, I did enjoy Junior's creation....But then she had to kill Chompers so...And another thing! She killed off all the witches!! Why? That was Caleb's only chance to find out who he was in his past life and she just mass murders them! Ahhh! Now Caleb is going to be the only one stuck in Aden's head when everyone else leaves! That's pretty sucky! and I know Aden went back, but if he didn't, that would have really sucked!I feel really upset at this book, and I hope that everything is fixed in the next book."}, {"userName": "YourFriendlyNeighborhoodSpidey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7540236-yourfriendlyneighborhoodspidey", "userReview": "THERE IS GOING TO BE ANOTHER BOOK IN THIS SERIES. I don't care if there's not one announced or whatever, or that she's currently working on new series, BECAUSE THIS ONE IS NOT OVER.it's just not. there were far too many loose ends left untied at the end of the book. and, the ENDING! that can't be the ending, I'm sorry, it just can't. so. there will be another book in this series. and that is final.so, beginning of this book, some graphic and bloody scenes with Aden and Victoria. And then, VIctoria and fangirls everywhere burst out in tears, becuase we all love Aden for his Aden-ness and he lost that a little bit. He got it back, fortunately. If he hadn't, I would've screamed. Drama between Mary Ann and Riley, of course. We meet Victoria's brother. stuff with Tucker and Vlad.back to Untied ends: Riley, Vlad, are both examples. yeah. I'm not reviewing this book right, because I'm mad because I thought this would be a 3-book series, and now I'm waiting for a fourth one.I don't enjoy waiting.sorry. I'm gonna stop typing now.**update September 3, 2012**It's cool, guys. I just found out that yes, there WILL be a fourth book, coming out in June 2013.

I loved Intertwined when I first read it, I didn't love Unraveled as much because of how it ended. But I really just didn't like the direction this book has taken with the characters. Aden was so up and down in his personality and no-one was even questioning it. I mean, one minute he was the nice guy he was before, next he was practically a cold blooded murderer and just wanted to go to war with the other races. Did I just miss the explanation for this in the book?I also would have thought that everybody would have been a little more concerned about Victoria turning into a human? I realize that in this series it's probably not going to be this way, but in most other movies/books where vampires have lost their powers they usually instantly age to how old they actually are. So I just would have thought that it was a little more worrying. Anyway, I don't mean to be trashing this book or anything, some people may like the direction that they story has taken, but it was not for me. So I am not sure if I will be wanting to read the next book."}, {"userName": "ephrielle", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1627926-ephrielle", "userReview": "This book really deserves two ratings or maybe no ratings. The rating I chose above reflects how I feel about the way the story played out. So, as far as everything else is concerned this was a good book. The characters were well written and the story very compelling. Basically, I hate things that leave me feeling insulted. Yeah, this it turns out qualifies. *Spolier Alert*Okay I have read 1572 pages only to be told it was all a pointless waste of my precious time and brain cells. Psych, nevermind. Just forget that all happened. Well why bother writing it in the first place? None of the characters will be themselves anymore. Okay, in the authors defense I am going to assume it won't work out as predicted. Otherwise it seems to scream we should get stuck in the shoulda woulda coulda instead of facing the here and now. So does this mean we have to read three more books covering the same time period? This could be endless.Oh and by the way Riley is such a turd. At the end of the story he loses his spot as my favorite character. Such a complete waste."}, {"userName": "Miles Lutz", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9605728-miles-lutz", "userReview": "Well the story is exactly as how it is named \"twisted\"!!! I too felt that the storyline was at least 70% filler! It had a good storyline, it captivated me. The first and second book were great but once it reached the third book things took a turn for the worst. And the sexual relationship between Riley and Victoria, despite the fact it happened before she met Aden it was very unnecessary and made my stomach churn! It deflated the love between the characters putting tension and mistrust there. And as for the character Mary ann. If I were her I would be not only disappointed but upset even though it happened before they met she was still lied to! And know the fact that she's been turned into what is called a \"drainer\" Gena almost makes her sound like a succubus! And as for going back in time to change the future it sort of defeats the purpose of the first three books which I might add where not cheap in purchasing! However if you want to go back in time to change Riley and Victoria's sexual F up around by all means feel free!"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6511836-emily", "userReview": "So I suffered through this entire book and the one before it, just to find out that we're going back to the beginning. Course, I'm assuming that Aden can still go back, but I'm pretty sure he can so this just got frustrating. I hope there's only one more book, because this story just has to end! I already couldn't stand Aden/Victoria. Now Mary Ann/Riley are gone and they were the reason I was reading the book. With Aden going back to the beginning in the next book, there's no telling what could change, but I want Mary Ann/Riley together and things to be great between them. On a side note, I can't stand that Riley and Victoria slept together and that really bothers me. It almost makes me feel like I don't think Riley is good enough for Mary Ann. I really think that hurt the characters more than anything else could have. To be honest, I skipped several pages of this book. Especially if Aden was the POV, I couldn't take him."}], "description": "His vampire girlfriend might have brought him back to life, but he's never felt more out of control.
