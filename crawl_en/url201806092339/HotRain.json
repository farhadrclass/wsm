I have never read anything by this author before but i will definitely be looking for more of her books! this one was so fast paced and it kept me completely enthralled! the characters were amazing! When I got to the end of the book I really felt like i was saying goodbye to friends. I really liked how she made the story last over several weeks and months and didn't have the main characters expressing their undying love after a few days or even a week like some books i have read... there was so much adventure that she probably could have gotten away with two books from this one but the fact that she didn't makes me very happy! no waiting for book 2 to find out what happens!"}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2706351-angela", "userReview": "I really thought I'd like this book based on the summary but why would I want the two leads together after the violence he inflicted upon her? I don't care how the writer \"justified\" the actions, there was no reason to go there."}, {"userName": "Sunni", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/73538289-sunni", "userReview": "I loved this book. It captured my attention from the very beginning and held it. It is full of adventure and more importantly, misadventure. Ms. Martin writes some very enthralling and steamy love scenes amid all the action, and the suspense and mystery will keep you on the edge of your seat. I was amazed at the way Ms. Martin could weave a tale across continents, cultures, and numerous unsettling events without losing the depth of every character in the book. She is a very powerful writer. The ending proves this fact to the fullest as it isn't what one would expect. I was very surprised, but pleasantly. I can't wait to get my hands on some of her other novels."}, {"userName": "Dusty_Rusty", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43917539-dusty-rusty", "userReview": "3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Patty Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7206044-patty-campbell", "userReview": "I've never read a Kat Martin book that I didn't enjoy.

Not getting anywhere with the police Allie takes the case on and starts her own investigation. This is not the best move but friendship is priceless and everyone needs closure. After some snooping and searching, Allie finds herself as a stowaway on a yacht that is set for ports unknown.Allie is terrified when she is caught and fears what the two men standing in front of her are about to do. To Allie\u2019s surprise the captain Jacob Michael Dawson steps up to save her. Jake looks like trouble surrounded by a stunning package but can Allie trust him not to hurt her. He is very clear about the danger they are in and tells her to behave but Allie has her own ideas and most of them involve escape. When escaping proves to be not an option Allie starts to realize Jake is not the enemy he may in fact just be her salvation. She has put the pieces of what the yacht was really carrying and just how much danger they are in. When things go from horribly wrong to downright horrific Allie finds herself stranded in the jungle with Jake knee deep in mud and bugs and her only thought survival. Once Jake tells her what is really going on she tries to believe him, but still there is the doubt that perhaps he is playing everyone. When Jake and Allie enter the belly of the beast, they must lean on each other and being held through the night sure does help ease the pain.Reading any Kat Martin book regardless of the genre always provides you with the romance and adventure in perfect proportions. This book was published in 2002 and the writing style of Ms. Martin has changed over time. However, her ability with character building and relationships come shining through. A must read for all Kat Martin fans!"}, {"userName": "\u2661 Sassy ~ Amy \u2661", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4377854-sassy-amy", "userReview": "This was an amazing book. It came out in 2002 & thanks to the new cover... which does matter... It was a great read with a hot guy to picture. I love a hot 6 foot 4\" ex special forces guy any day!Sooo, Allie stows away on a boat/small yacht which belongs to the man she believes killed her best friend. Actually she sneaks on board to search for some evidence & people get on, she can't escape, so she hides. She's found by a lowly Mexican gang like man (very very bad guy) & the head of the op, decides he gets to use her while they are on their trip until he tires of her. Ahhh don't fret, we all know he's really a good guy & all of that is predictable.... They end up crashed in a jungle & hiking to the militant camp in Belize to sell (stuff)... Stuff happens, and I thought it was near over several times, but I wasn't even 2/3 done with the book.I loved that it was about a trip from SanDiego to Belize. I knew what she was talking about & where. At one point she talked about a store open late & I said to myself that it closed at 6pm where she was talking about & it was clarified as to why & that YES they are closed at 6... just saying... Even the where's & whats of the city were real. As for the jungle, I am not sure. A realistic crime & undercover op, yes it's believable.This book was one I started last night & hated to put it down, so during a Saturday, I would sneak off & read while people thought I was busy doing normal weekend chores (hahaha) Actually everyone else was doing things they were supposed to do 2 weeks ago & felt I needed to look busy even though I finished what I was supposed to do 2 weeks ago. This was my real first Kat Martin book & she has me hooked!I would say she's like Cindy gerard in her Romantic Suspense books but I have no idea yet about her historical books. NOW... I am off to find another book!"}, {"userName": "Haley Osborn", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54429155-haley-osborn", "userReview": "I LOED the concept and story of this book. And I am almost always hard pressed to find a well told story plot like it. I give it three stars only because the beginning was a little slow for me as it set up the sory. I felt that we knew what was going on so it could've been better. The second reason is becuase the side romance of Barb's I felt was a little unneeded. I enjoyed it but it didn't need full chapters dedicated to her becuase she wasn't the concentration on the story and it took away from Allie and Jake.Allie and Jake I thought were fantastic characters. Allie was strong and like many woman today not knowing what she wants to do in life but lookin for it, strong, smart with a mind of her own and more than ready to speak it. Jake is strong, smart and slightly cynical but there's a part of him that wants more but because of the betrayals of the past he he finds it difficult to see that what he wants is right in front of him. Instead he protects hmself withcynism...in the form of blond jokes. Which becuase I love the character so muc I found it forgiveable. In another review someone took down the stars becuase of the use of blond jokes and their number. This didn't bother me becuase I felt that it was a defenisve sheild for Jake and I understood that and...some were funny. Allie and Jake together are nothing less than entertaining. I love there interactions together as they have to rely on each other for survival and fall in love along the way. Their trials were not only intersting and exciting but also very real.I fully enjoyed this book from how it was written to characters and story."}, {"userName": "Cindy ~ SnS Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4512039-cindy-sns-reviews", "userReview": "Mary Alice Parker (Allie) watched as her best friend and roommate who she was seeing off at the marina to go off with her boyfriend die when then boat exploded minutes after taking off.

Allie and Jake are awesome together. I love all the adventures they got up to, while trying to bring Baranoff down. I loved how over the course of the book, Jake realized that he was in love with Allie.I'm also a big fan of action and this book was jam-packed with tons of it, which I love. I love that Allie started all of it by trying to get justice for her friend Chrissy, and in the process, ended up finding the love of her life.I also love that even though Jake fought falling in love with Allie through the book, he still wanted what was best for her through the whole thing. That shows how much he loves her.My favorite part was the last two chapters where Miguel was brought back so Allie and Jake could adopt him, and when Jake finally decided to try and find his son."}, {"userName": "Black Butterfly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18371985-black-butterfly", "userReview": "THAT'S ONE HOT COVER AND AN EVEN HOTTER STORY INSIDE.

I have always referred to romance novels as bubble gum for the mind, but this book is so much more than that. It has a gripping plot and realistic characterizations. You can really understand the characters feelings and thought processes and you get to know and like them throughout the book. There are so many interesting twists and turns in the plot that it really kept me interested and was not predictable. Also, I do love a good ending!! There is enough angst and disappointment in real life, a novel with a good ending is just a wonderful escape. Overall, I loved it!!
