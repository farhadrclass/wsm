Now few of the others will lament her passing as she was, as the title suggests, \u2018a pain in the tuchis\u2019 for the others. She\u2019d moan, complain and threaten, making life difficult for others at times and meaning she wasn\u2019t the most popular person in the home by any means. When she dies, initially nothing is suspected but her sister raises concerns with Mrs Kaplan and Mrs Berkowitz, asking for help from this intrepid duo to find out how her sister died. With disagreements with the police, interactions with the other residents and plenty of jewish and humorous references this is a delightful story to escape into as Mrs K again tries to discover who the murderer might be, putting her own life in danger in the process!This is a great detective story, packed with Jewish references and humour. A delight to read, I highly recommend it to anyone likes their murder mysteries to be solved by the elderly Jewish equivalent to Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson!Thanks to the author, publisher and NetGalley, too, for letting me read an ARC of this book in exchange for this, an honest review."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "A Pain in the Tuchis: A Mrs. Kaplan Mystery by Mark Reutlinger is a 2015 Alibi publication. I was provided a copy of this book by the publisher and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. The author charmed me so much with the first book in this series, I immediately queued up the second book. I am happy to report that the momentum never slowed down as Ida and Rose once more find themselves in embroiled in a suspicious death at the Jewish senior home where they reside. This time, a grumpy resident with a mean streak, suddenly takes ill and requires constant care. When she passes away, no one is all that surprised, and foul play never crosses anyone\u2019s mind, until it\u2019s hinted at by another resident. Rose\u2019s inner Sherlock Holmes awakens and she takes it upon herself to find the truth in order to give the family peace of mind. Ida is a perfect narrator, giving the reader all the facts and adding her own perspective as well, which is often laugh out loud funny. The author has painted the portrait of these two senior sleuths perfectly. I can see them in my mind\u2019s eye and envision all their adventures. The language is authentic, using accurate Yiddish words and dialect, but I did notice some definitions were added a few times so that everyone understood the dialogue without having to give the kindle dictionary a workout, which is probably a good idea. The mystery was a well thought out and evenly paced, with a few zany side adventures, and some surprising twists thrown in for good measure. I have to say this is one the best new cozy mystery series I\u2019ve discovered this year. If you love humor with your mystery, then I challenge you to read this series. You will be glad you did."}, {"userName": "Space Out With Sci Fi in June The Haunted Reading Room", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7302570-space-out-with-sci-fi-in-june-the-haunted-reading-room", "userReview": "REVIEW: A PAIN IN THE TUCHIS by Mark Reutlinger[Mrs. Kaplan Mystery #2]Sharp as a knife senior Rose Kaplan and her friend and sidekick Ida reside in a home for Jewish senior citizens, not a likely site for crime, tribulations, or murder.

Although I am not Jewish (yes, I am a Goy), I love Yiddish. This book uses the phrases very well, which makes the dialog even better, funnier. This mystery begins after Vera Gold, who lives in the Julius and Rebecca Cohen Home for Jewish Seniors, tells her sister that someone is trying to poison her with her pills. But, she won't divulge who she thinks it may be. She also claims to have thrown the \"poison pills\" away. The very next day, Vera is found dead of \"natural causes\".Her sister refuses to call the police with her suspicions because she has no solid evidence to back up Vera's claim. So she does the next best thing. She seeks the advice of fellow residents, Rose Kaplan and Ida Berkowitz. Together, the friends have already solved one murder. They decide to talk to Vera's doctor, who is also a medical examiner.He tells them that a pathologist would have to perform an autopsy in order to find out if there was poison found in Vera's system. It is against Jewish tradition to perform an autopsy. However, it could be done with the permission of the next of kin ONLY. That would have to come from Vera's son, Daniel. But, will he agree to it?This is a wonderfully juicy cozy mystery. It is full of intrigue with a long list of suspects. The characters are richly written. It has humor, and is a great read. I am looking forward to the next book.

WHAT A CUTE BOOK! This is the second novel in Mark Reutlinger's Mrs. Kaplan Mystery series. It could be read alone, but I suggest also reading Mrs. Kaplan and the Matzoh Ball of Death as it is a very cute novel, too. In this second novel, Mrs. Kaplan and her friend Mrs. Berkowitz, the narrator of the book, are again on the trail of a murderer at the Julius and Rebecca Cohen Home for Jewish Seniors. Vera Gold, the home's most disliked citizen, has passed away on Yom Kippur and the cause of her death is mysterious and when the ladies find out that she had indeed been murdered, they feel it is their responsibility to assist the nice Inspector Corcoran and his shlumpy partner, Detective Jenkins. This book reads like you are sitting and talking to your Jewish grandmother who is trying to tell you three stories at once. Some of the tangents had me laughing out loud, especially the one about \"Motorcycle Moishe.\" If I were to deduct a half of a star, it would be because of the overuse of Yiddish words, but Reutlinger translates all of these words and phrases.

Mrs. K and her BFF/ 'Dr. Watson', Ida Berkowitz, are known throughout the Cohen Home for Jewish Seniors as clear thinkers, able to piece together the truth behind the vagaries of life in a senior living community. Mrs. K is not shy about speaking with authority figures and she is almost rabbinical in her analysis of fraught situations. With their Yiddish idioms, zest for a good story and fondness for a little nosh while they sort through the issues, these latter day Sherlocks are a delight.

It is his second in the Mrs. Kaplan Mystery series. Mrs. Vera Gold is, according to the narrator, a real pain in the tuchis or behind and is murdered in the Jewish senior home on Yom Kippur. Mrs. Rose Kaplan and Mrs. Ida Berkowitz, two residents of the home, try to solve the murder and save Daniel Gold, Vera's son, from conviction for the murder. They unofficially work with the police and are able to identify the murderer after several plot twists. Fans of Murder She Wrote would enjoy this series. Having read this one, I plan on reading the first book of the series."}], "description": "Combining the classic charms of Agatha Christie with the delightful humor of M. C. Beaton\u2019s Agatha Raisin novels, Mark Reutlinger\u2019s Mrs. Kaplan mystery series returns as a notorious crank meets an untimely fate. \u00a0 Yom Kippur is a day of reflection and soul searching. But at the Julius and Rebecca Cohen Home for Jewish Seniors, Vera Gold misses this opportunity to atone for her many sins when she up and dies. Indeed, Vera was such a pain in the tuchis to all those around her that when her sister claims Vera was deliberately poisoned, the tough question isn\u2019t who would want to kill her\u2014but who wouldn\u2019t?  \u00a0 Having already solved one murder with her dear friend Ida, Rose Kaplan has a sleuthing reputation that precedes her. It\u2019s only natural that Vera\u2019s sister turns to Mrs. K for help. So do the police, but when her conclusions conflict with theirs, they tell her to butt out! This case has more twists than a loaf of challah. And with a homicidal scoundrel on the loose, Mrs. K has to act fast\u2014or she might be the guest of honor at the Home\u2019s next memorial service.Praise for A Pain in the Tuchis\n\u00a0\n \u201cA pure joy to read . . .
