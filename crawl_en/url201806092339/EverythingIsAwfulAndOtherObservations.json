I was ready to declare once and for all to the pornbrarian that . . . . \nBut then I realized maybe he/she doesn\u2019t know me quite as well as I thought they did because there were like eleventy-four people ahead of me in the queue and I very much have the mindset that This Is America and OF COURSE I Want It Now! Mind you, I had no idea who Matt Bellassai was. I simply bemoaned the fact that my entitled butt would have to wait a hot minute rather than receive instant gratification. Then I did what I do best and forgot all about this book until finally my turn did come around and I checked out the synopsis.Here are some things to know about me:1. I still don\u2019t really know who Matt Bellassai is, although his book made me laugh the terrifying \u201cwhat if I lart\u201d (definition below) laugh that happens when old ladies attempt to contain their guffaws whilst reading at work.2. I\u2019m not positive I know what a Buzzfeed is either and no I\u2019m not interested in looking it up, but apparently that\u2019s how this guy initially became famous. (I think there was some other Buzzfeed thing that I wasn\u2019t familiar with and some of you tried to explain to me, but alas I am dumb and also maybe have early onset dementia so I don\u2019t remember any specifics.)3. I do not and will not ever (yeah yeah, immortal Bieberish words remind me to . . . . \nbut I feel pretty comfortable saying never here) spend my free time watching You Tubers or vloggers. (I started jotting down my ramblings simultaneously with reading this book, so I now know that Bellassai isn\u2019t a traditional \u201cYou Tuber\u201d \u2013 I think \u2013 maybe, but he did do a video on the internet that went viral so tomato/tomahto.) My husband and friends can\u2019t even get me to watch Netflix and that is a simple button on my remote that I don\u2019t know how to work, but at least I know exists. I refuse to use a computer once I leave the office and my phone is for making phone calls (and about twice a week to send a text it takes me 14 years to type out since I insist on using real words and punctuation). I have nothing against You Tubers or viral videologists \u2013 I\u2019ll just be leaving the addiction to watching their videos to the youth of the nation. That being said, I have still not taken a gander at Bellassai\u2019s (apparently People\u2019s Choice Award winning) web series.4. I frequently complain (even when I enjoy their stories okay) about youngsters who write memoirs because they haven\u2019t lived long enough to have accrued experiences that fill a \u201clife story\u201d and instead seem to be cashing in before their 15 minutes of fame runs out. That\u2019s why I\u2019m choosing to call Bellassai an \u201cessayist\u201d \u00e0 la David Sedaris. His stories may be about himself, but they are presented as snippets of life rather than an autobiography and also because I am allowed to be as fickle as I would like to be.Okay, so now that you\u2019ve had to endure allllllll of that overshare, here\u2019s the point: I was not and am not familiar with Matt Bellassai \u2013 something I\u2019m sure he would be completely comfortable with since I highly doubt middle-aged, fat, married women are his target demographic. That being said, this book was FREAKING HYSTERICAL \u2013 to the point aforementioned that I was more than a bit concerned I might laugh fart (a/k/a lart) since I was trying my best to not allow any raucous sounds to escape my body from one orifice and that those sounds would therefore choose a different one. And although I\u2019m almost certain that I am nearly old enough to have birthed this boy (should I have chosen motherhood instead of high school), we are of one mind when it comes many different topics and especially to one particular terrifying entity:\n\u201cSay one wrong thing, however innocuous yet hilarious you think it may be, and you become Teenage Girl Enemy Number One. I\u2019m chubby, gay, pale and a whole decade older than most of them, which means I might as well wear a sign that says, \u201cHello fellow Internet users, please destroy my entire life.\u201d\nIf you are in need of something light that will confirm that - no, your new mascara is indeed not waterproof, this might be the book for you. Now I have to make an exception to everything I said up top and FINALLY Google this cat in order to watch the Drunk at Work or whatever the fuck his shit is called before my friend here at the office bludgeons me to death with my stapler : )IMMEDIATE EDIT: Google search officially complete (or as complete as I want it to be which means I watched one video and now I'm going to figure out what book I'm going to read next). I deactivated my Facebook account around a month ago for all of the reasons listed HERE. Matt Bellassai is my Patronus."}, {"userName": "Lauren Mcmanamon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22963051-lauren-mcmanamon", "userReview": "I never take the time to write reviews, but given my one star rating, I feel the necessity to justify it. For anyone who enjoyed Matt's Buzzfeed show \"Whine About It,\" I bet you were equally as excited to see his book announcement as you were when new episodes would come out. However, I'm not sure if the brevity of the videos' format made it more enjoyable or if I've simply grown out of this style of humor. The entire book comes across as a rambling, entitled mess. What I think is his attempt to normalize the chaos of adulthood simply comes off like a toddler screaming on the floor of a mall. He comes off as braggadocious about how little effort he puts into each day, playing right into the hands of any person who is on the \"I hate Millennials\" bandwagon. I know it's intending to be for dramatic effect, to get more laughs, but there's no purpose for it. I think the easiest comparison would be Shane Dawson's books, \"I Hate My Selfie\" and \"It Gets Worse.\" Both use the same kind of stories and humor: self-deprecating, emphasizing on being bad adults and having a rough coming-of-age. However, Shane's tie up nicely into life lessons, or things he's used to become better and wants to share, whereas Matt's just come off as excuses and \"woe as me's.\""}, {"userName": "Michel Avenali", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20825678-michel-avenali", "userReview": "A combination of factors conspired to make me binge read this in a few hours this evening even though I had no idea who Matt Bellassai was or what the book was about:1) saw it randomly on the goodreads choice awards2) cute ginger guy on the cover3) a very long day at work and needed to mentally check out for a few hoursAll such criteria being met I literally sped through this book in record time and had a few laughs throughout.

It's called Whine About It and it's HILARIOUS. So when Whine About It ended, he started To Be Honest, which is virtually the same thing with a different name. Then he started the Unhappy Hour podcast, which once again includes Matt getting drunk and complaining, but this time with other people!Now that you know who he is, lets talk about Everything is Awful. Once you get his voice and mannerisms down, you can almost hear every word as if you were watching the video On Why Teenagers are the Worst (great chapter by the way, I was getting ugly stares on the bus because I couldn't stop laughing). It's told through short chapters, each dealing with one annoying thing or the other. Mostly, it's just Matt rambling on like he does in his sensational videos, just with less alcohol (well that might be a lie, he could have drunk written this entire book, who knows). Basically I have two points to make with this review:1) Go watch his videos2) Go buy this book3) Do these two things immediatelyThis review and more can be found at A Reader's Diary!"}, {"userName": "Courtney", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13045881-courtney", "userReview": "Matt Bellassai is AMAZING!!!I had no idea who he was before he grace my newsfeed on facebook with \"Wine About It Wednesdays.\" And from that it was like a match made in heaven for me.

Well, I am never one to be afraid to admit, I was totally wrong.Even if you have never heard of Matt Bellassai before (who are you and why haven't you?!? - I kid) you really should read this.

Now I faithfully follow his \"TBH\" videos posted on his own Facebook page and nod in agreement each week as he guzzles his bottle of wine and vents about relevant problems that plague this world. Granted, they're first world problems, but still. He gets me. He's my ginger spirit animal and I want to be his BFF. Seriously, how do I get that to happen?!?!? His debut book was a must read and it didn't disappoint. It's a hilarious inside glimpse into Matt's life from his childhood, his teen years,\u00a0 and his coming out of the closet in college. Literally and figuratively. We learn all about what molded and shaped Matt into the fabulous, snarky, sassy man he is today! What I absolutely LOVED about this book was that this WAS written by Matt in his own voice. No one tried to change his style. No one tried to tell him he can't have a chapter on why teenagers are the worst. And every single reason was on point. As is his take on working out...\"It\u2019s no surprise, then, that I\u2019ve grown distrustful of physical activity in my mature state. For me, fitness will always equal shame and pain, broken bones and the bad kind of balls to the face.\"Amen, my friend. AMEN.If you're a fan of Matt's videos, you will love this book from start to finish. If you're like me, your stomach will be hurting from laughter at page two. And if you've never heard of Matt before, you MUST RECTIFY THIS IMMEDIATELY OR WE CAN NO LONGER BE FRIENDS! I've done you a solid and posted his social media links below in his bio. I'm also giving you the links to his Unhappy Hour podcast because I'm helpful like that.

And being the same age as him, we've had some very similar experiences, but it's much funnier reading someone else's growing pains rather than reliving my own.The only reason it took me like a week to finish was because I laughed so much that I couldn't let myself read in public on my commute to work."}, {"userName": "Daniele (Life of a Quinn)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39674616-daniele-life-of-a-quinn", "userReview": "MATT BELLASSAI IS MY HEROFirst book of 2018 and it did not disappoint.

So, thanks for that. I'm sure they'll feel both pleased and vindicated. I, on the other hand, feel merely frustrated to see all the misinformation about my generation reinforced. If this book is truly representative of his experiences, Bellassai has led a privileged, if not charmed, life, so to read a litany of complaints about every perceived slight or misadventure he experienced, despite none of them being truly out of the ordinary in the slightest (everyone wets their pants in kindergarten, Matt), is exhausting and grating. I've given this two stars because he does, briefly, actually appeal to our humanity AND take accountability for his actions in the chapter wherein he describes coming to terms with his sexuality and his first experience with unrequited love, which is the first time in some 200 pages he genuinely comes across as self-aware and capable of empathy for other human beings. But then he immediately follows it with an EIGHT PAGE description of the first time his college roommate masturbated, as if he needs to immediately bury whatever burgeoning sympathy the reader may feel for him.If you enjoy self-deprecation or secondhand embarrassment, then this may be for you. But if you don't think you would have fun listening to an entitled manchild who assuredly makes way more money than you (unless you also can afford to live alone in the Upper West Side of NYC) act like his life was utterly terrible because he had braces as a child, give this one a hard pass.

I gave Everything Is Awful a shot and was happy to get more of the same millenial-based, spot-on, relatable content. He tells us exactly what we want to hear (\"I chug a few bottles of wine throughout the week, which is basically the same as juicing, but with even more antioxidants\") while still letting his personality shine throughout (\"It was a beautiful morning \u2014 crisp, you might say, if you used words like that to describe the air and not a potato chip\").I gave this four instead of five stars because the humor and relatability definitely decline in the latter half of the book.

His videos give me life, I find him absolutely hysterical, and I've had the pleasure of seeing him perform live, which was pretty much everything. I was so excited to read this book by him and I knew it would be funny, memorable, and just all around enjoyable. It was all of that and more.I actually listened to the audiobook version which was narrated by him. That just made this book even more incredible. Listening to his stories, getting to experience his writing style, and getting to laugh my butt off for her six hours was the absolute best. This book baby laugh out loud so much, it was so easy to listen to, and I really enjoyed listening to the variety of stories that he told. It was very him, it was bursting with so much humor that I cannot get enough of, and it just made me a bigger fan of him. If you're a fan of Matt Bellassai you will enjoy this book. You'll get the perfect dose of his humor and antics that will have you almost crying you're laughing so hard.

Talking about a Slip 'n' Slide? Being on family vacation at a cottage where... nothing happens? Being a science nerd? Inane lists about qualities he'd like his future husband to have.
