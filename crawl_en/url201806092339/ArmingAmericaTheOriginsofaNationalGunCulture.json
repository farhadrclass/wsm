This situtation really made me think about how I choose books to read. I have never before researched the validity of a book before reading it more than reading friend's reviews on Good Reads or something similar. As a consumer of information, I expected the publisher and the world of historical scholars to check all that for me before the book was even published. I find it very disturbing that I was relying on a system that apparently doesn't exist."}, {"userName": "Douglas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10457462-douglas", "userReview": "It is most unfortunate that Bellesiles compromised his scholarly integrity by fudging one stream of data (weapons passed along through probate in the eighteenth century). This opened the door to scrutiny of his research data by other scholars and ultimately the loss of his professorship and standing as a historian. That is as it should be.But overall, this book contains an extraordinary bit of research and writing on the history of this country's obsession with guns. While the data on probate records represents a very small fraction of the total picture he assembles, he offers a fascinating analysis of historical records that show a picture of this country's history quite different than the one put forth by gun enthusiasts. The fact is, probate record-fudging notwithstanding, this country's origins and expansion beginning from the early seventeenth century do not support the notion that our ancestors were knowledgeable about and competent with the use of firearms. Quite the contrary, it was not until the Civil War that guns were ubiquitous and users were adequately skilled in their use.This is a big book, in both size and implications for dismantling the myth of gun ownership from our country's beginnings."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "Do not read.

Random reading failed to uncover anything interesting. However, I deduced the author, his employer (Emory University, Atlanta) and publisher are what my late friend, Jack Bruny, would sarcastically describe as part of a \"pinko, red conspiracy\" to discredit the National Rifel Association. I don't take sides on this topic. I also don't want to wast my time reading political propaganda. I did spend several pleasant minutes remembering Jack, his dedication to the ceramic tile and terrazzo business as well as to hunting and fishing, his total recall of everything which had ever happened to him, and his desire to share all of it with his friends.

Bellesiles leaps to the forefront of a recent move by scholars toward reexamining this mythology of the gun. To every article of the legend, Bellesiles mounts a relentless and eye-opening barrage of counterevidence, gathered over ten years of research in probate records, censuses, government and military documents, and other primary sources.Examining the growth of our national gun culture from colonial times to Reconstruction, Bellesiles finds that its progress was a slow and tortured one. From the first settlements up until the Civil War, ordinary Americans were not heavily armed and were generally neglectful of the guns they did own. Guns of the time were expensive, clumsy, unreliable, and hard to maintain. Opposing other historians' claims for nearly universal gun ownership among the settlers, Bellesiles finds that apparently \"at no time prior to 1850 did more than a tenth of the people own guns.\"During the Revolutionary War, the civilian militias were, again contrary to myth, ineffective on the whole as a fighting force. One basic reason: The great majority of their members had never bothered to arm themselves or attain proficiency in shooting. After the war was won by professionals, the government labored for the next 70 years to arm a surprisingly resistant citizenry.The Civil War finally brought reality into line with the myth. Technological improvements, massive government investment, and the training in gun use of virtually every able American male brought firearms into the mainstream at last -- with a chilling rise in civilian violence as its legacy.The shattering implications of Bellesiles' argument for scholars, policy-makers, and ruminators upon the national character are clearly evident, but he leaves them unstated. We are left to draw our own conclusions, but this formidably researched, vigorously written book earns the power to ground our currently high-flown gun debate in solid historical earth.\n--Edward Hutchinson", "title": "Arming America: The Origins of a National Gun Culture", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2216931.Arming_America", "average": 2.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328032357l/2216931.jpg", "reviews": 12, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/92727.Michael_Bellesiles", "name": "Michael Bellesiles"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "Literature", "Politics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2216931.Arming_America", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8145452-1877", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347070.Revolutionary_Outlaws", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12469456-a-people-s-history-of-the-u-s-military", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17462841-1877", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9093061-documenting-american-violence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
