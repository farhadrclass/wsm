Two of my favorite subjects. I really wanted to like this book. Not only was Moe Berg a catcher for the Red Sox and one of the first Jewish players in baseball, but he also happened to do a little moonlighting in espionage on the side. It should have made for a riveting story, full of twists and turns, savory Cold war nuggets and revealing baseball lore. And in the hands of another author, perhaps it would have. But somehow, in the hands of Nicholas Davidoff, it reads like one of the dry textbooks of Moe Berg's era. Wordy, barren of excitement, the account strips down even the most interesting facts of Berg's life to their most mundane parts. I came away from this book with the belief that Davidoff had done Berg an injustice, which is really ironic considering this is a man with whom Davidoff is clearly obsessed."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2201980-michael", "userReview": "I have never read a book that was such a chore to finish.I felt like making a flow chart to follow all the people and a map to keep track of all the places he went. I found it a very confusing book to read. Many of the people quoted in the book say what a great story teller Moe Berg was, yet the story is told so poorly by the author. The people also say how secretive Berg was and that most of the time no one knew how he could afford to live let alone what he was doing from day to day and that makes me wonder how the author could write a 365 page book about someone no one knew anything about.The author did a lot of research for this book and it shows in the amount of information that really brings the enjoyment level down."}, {"userName": "Randal", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14421553-randal", "userReview": "One of the dullest books I've ever read.Part of the problem is that it's so well-researched. Berg went to London for two weeks, where, wearing his usual white shirt, grey suit and black tie, he stayed at the Claridge Hotel and dined with this person and that person, although he did not submit timely expense accounts, and then he disappeared for two weeks, turning up in Stockholm, where he dined with this scientist and still did not submit his expense accounts -- while wearing his usual white shirt, grey suit and black tie.Just a fantastic amount of work must have gone into researching that. But:Who cares. And that's toward the end of his active spying at the end of WWII, before we get onto Moe didn't know what to do with the rest of his life so he didn't really do much.It's not so much a narrative -- he's repeatedly portrayed as wildly charming but almost none of that charm comes across in the book ... he's discriminated against in a general, WASPish way in Princeton, but then having gone to Princeton opens doors for him with the OSS -- as it is a laundry list of an interesting but obscure life. The repeated inability to pull back that obfuscation leaves the reader a little puzzled even at the end about the subject of the book and eventually leaves one scratching one's head about why it's such a subject of focus: Berg went here but we don't know why; Berg went there but didn't talk about it. If you are happy making up exciting things Berg might have been doing during the lapses, the book's likely a better read.I wanted very much to read and like this book.

It should have been a magazine article. On the surface the idea of a book about a baseball player who also was a spy was very intriguing. However, Moe Berg was neither a great baseball player nor a great spy. Granted it was still a cool story but one that was so meticulously research and told that it was very boring. The problem with the story was the lack or real conflict. At no time was Berg ever really in trouble with no issues to overcome or resolve. It is impressive that Berg managed to never really get a job in his whole life and having the amount of time to pursue reading and travel must have been great for him, but not so much for the reader. I really struggled to get through this one and most of the second half of the book did not enjoy turning the pages. I rarely recommend not reading a book but this is one of the few I would completely steer clear of if I were a potential reader."}, {"userName": "Brian Eshleman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5862823-brian-eshleman", "userReview": "If my experience is any indication, the reader is that once maddened by Berg's insistence on fashioning a persona rather than applying himself in a straightforward way AND fascinated by the persona he created.SECOND READING: Less exasperation and more fascination this time, which is perhaps a function of time and experience on my part rather than any \"changes\" in this deceased subject. Moe Berg is fascinating in his own right. I love his determination to be himself and to live a life of the mind that will not constrict itself to circumstance or bank balance."}, {"userName": "Quo", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7392004-quo", "userReview": "The title of this book sounds as if it could have been written by Mickey Spillane but it is in fact a well-crafted story of a little-known ballplayer, Morris \"Moe\" Berg, an exceedingly enigmatic figure who played baseball almost by default. But more than a story of a 3rd string, journeyman backstop, The Catcher Was a Spy by Nicholas Dawidoff is a deeply engaging psychological profile of a man personified by the adjective \"crepuscular\", as shadowy & mysterious as he was intellectually gifted, with a magna cum laude diploma from Princeton, a period of study at the Sorbonne in Paris, a law degree from Columbia & a keen facility with languages. A baseball scout once said that Moe was fluent in 7 languages (including Sanskrit) but could not hit in any of them. While regarded as a charming & erudite man, he apparently was unable to form meaningful & lasting social connections with others. On occasion, people would be in the midst of a conversation with Moe while walking down a street, only to find that he had suddenly vanished.Davidoff's research on Moe Berg is seemingly exhaustive but ultimately, some people are largely unknowable, even to themselves. I wonder what a neurologist like Dr. Oliver Sachs or a psychoanalyst might make of Berg? Beyond any clinical evaluation, Moe Berg's consciousness seems to have been haunted by the lack of familial recognition by his father Bernard, a pharmacist, his brother, Dr. Sam & his sister, Ethel. At every step of his life, Dawidoff turns up examples where those who should have been most open to Moe's against-the-grain or non-traditional behavior, rejected him, examples being when as a Princeton freshman he sent a poem to his brother who spurned it, or when he excelled at sports at college, eventually becoming a major league player while also continuing to work on a law degree at Columbia during the off-season, with his father disdaining Moe's choices in life. Moe's father seemed not just distant but antagonistic to Moe & the author offers examples of incidents when the son seemed to appeal to his father for love, or at the very least, to be afforded his father's respect, only to be rebuffed. Yes, this would seem to be a portrait of another dysfunctional family but Dawidoff makes the story of Moe Berg very compelling reading.Among the many attributes that caused Moe Berg to work as a spy most likely include his great intellectual curiosity, his gift for languages, his largely self-taught understanding of physics, his secretive nature + the fact that during an off-season baseball tour of Japan in 1934, Berg had managed to make a clandestine film record of many important buildings in Tokyo. For \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, also a former college athlete & Columbia Law graduate, later the head of the OSS during WWII, the predecessor to the CIA, Moe Berg's background & shadowy nature must have seemed a natural fit to perform undercover work, including trailing eminent German physicist Werner Heisenberg at an important conference in Switzerland in an attempt to discern how close Heisenberg & Nazi Germany were to gaining an atomic advantage that might have shifted the course of the war.This book is a thoughtful & fascinating profile of a man whose life was often a mystery, much more than a story about a baseball player. When asked why someone with such stunning academic credentials played baseball for so many years, Berg responded, \"I love it. I could never stop.\" And according to Nicholas Dawidoff, Over 19 seasons, it was an affection that had evolved, the way some marriages do, from passion to comfort. Baseball served Moe Berg well. It afforded him a lifestyle that he liked & offered him a center that he needed. For, if he was prepared for something, had been told what to look for, was carrying instructions, he was fine, even creative. Without guidance from a textbook, or a teacher, or a coach, or a parent, or a general, however, he grew confused & retreated. After leaving baseball, Moe Berg lost his center of gravity as it were & was never able to establish himself in a career or with a woman in spite of several attempts & often even lacked an address, though his brother & sister eventually both provided Moe with a spare room in Newark late in his life. Joe DiMaggio and the Chicago sportswriter Jerome Holtzman among others, also occasionally provided Moe with a room, meals & tickets to baseball games. Alas, even Moe Berg's end was shrouded in mystery, when his sister Ethel carted off his ashes to a secret location in Israel. This book may represent a depressing tale for some readers at this site but I thank Nicholas Dawidoff for introducing me to Moe Berg. And if the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein had somehow played major league baseball, I am sure that he would have found Moe Berg a kindred spirit!"}, {"userName": "Alexandria Barilone", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6468388-alexandria-barilone", "userReview": "The Catcher was a spy: the secret life of Moe Berg by Nicholas Dawidoff is a biography on the famous catcher Moe Berg. Throughout the book you start with the smart young Morris Berg, and learn about his amazing learning ability. As Moe grows up we learn about his passion for baseball and see him play for Princeton, The Red Soxs, Dodgers, and many other big league teams. As he grows he learns his real calling in baseball is to be a catcher, rather than the shortstop position he had previously made. In the 1940\u2019s Moe Berg found a job that suited him perfectly, and that was being a spy. He was a very mysterious man and no one every truly knew the real Moe Berg.\t This book helped me understand a lot more about World War two. During Hitler\u2019s A Bomb scare Moe was a spy who was sent to track down any information he could on the bomb, and the scientist. The scientist in charge was Dr. Werner Heisenberg, he was a German scientist who refused to leave Germany, but was anti-Nazi. He followed clues trying to figure out where Heisenberg was, which allowed Berg to do what he loved most, travel. During Moe\u2019s many missions, they would periodically lose touch with him for weeks to even months, and the next ting you\u2019d know Moe was back after spending a ton of money and claiming what he did was top secret. Moe was extremely good at his job. He received extremely important Intel that helped the US. He found out that Hitler\u2019s A Bomb was just a hoax, and saved Dr.Heisenberg\u2019s life, there were many ideas to end Heisenberg\u2019s life, and Berg nearly did himself, but he made a choice and decided that the Doctor was not a Nazi, just a very nationalistic German, and spared the doctors life. There were also talks of having him kidnapped and brought to the US, although they were considered they never really happened. Berg did meet Hiesenberg once, he listened to a molecular physics lecture that Moe had to use to Judge wither or not Hiesenberg was a threat, in the end he was not.\tMoe was extremely secretive; the author quotes a huge Moe berg fan whom followed him for years. Owen a fan who tracked most of moe's life says \u201cI don\u2019t know him now. I don\u2019t know if anybody knows Moe Berg. He kept secrets from everybody. Nobody\u2019ll ever know him.\u201d (Pages 4-5). The author\u2019s bias for writing the book was that he wanted to show the world who the real Moe Berg was; everyone knew a different side of him. He was completely different person with his family, his friends, his teammates and in the OSS. He always kept what he felt to himself, he was a very self-conscience man, he was Jewish and had to deal with some anti-Semitism at his college Princeton, and when he played baseball. When growing up his dad tried to hide their beliefs while trying to keep them at the same time. This confused him a lot, and helped created what seems to be a social phobia although it\u2019s odd. Moe was scared to tell people too much of himself, yet he was more than happy to pose for pictures, and always knew how to speak and react to people. Other people always had no problem opening up to berg and becoming quick friends, although his friendships never lasted long. I\u2019ve learned a lot about Moe Berg, he has become one of my favorite people throughout reading this book, and even though no one will ever truly know a hundred percent of Moe Berg I feel like I'm close to it and I relate to him on many different aspects of life. Moe Berg was a well-liked, well known, and knowledgeable man."}, {"userName": "Malcolm Anderson", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8486323-malcolm-anderson", "userReview": "#4 This book is quite possibly a hundred billion times better than the Awakening, almost as good as the Catcher in the Rye, better than the Great Gatsby, better than the Crucible, and not quite as good as small portion that we read of the Things We Carried, just to put this book in perspective with the others we have read this year. In this book, there is a \"dream\" portrayed. Moe Berg loved playing baseball more than anything else in his world. It made him happy just to be around the game, even if he didn't play. If possible, he would have continued to stay involved in baseball until he died, but because of the other endeavors he took on in his life, that idea was not feasible. As a first generation American Jew, his father set high standards for him, and so did society. He was expected to be very intelligent and do great things. But what was expected of him was far below what he accomplished in his life. Moe Berg became the best baseball player ever to graduate from Princeton, one of the best lawyers of his time, and one of the greatest intellectuals of his time. He had theoretical conversations with Albert Einstein, and played in the Major Leagues for 20 years. That is successful in any society. Fortunately for Moe Berg, he was able to adapt to many different cultures and remember everything he saw, read or heard. He was quite possibly the most succesful man in the widest range of expertise of this past century. The only fault he carried was the slight awkwardness when trying to keep himself busy when speaking to someone he did not like or thought was unintelligent. Besides this one small fault, moslty everything else Moe Berg participated in, he excelled and mastered. Moe Berg was succeful.#2 Moe Berg is a very complicated character who reveals little of his true personality. He is a man who has a wide breadth of knowledge and he increasing that range everyday. I am someone who likes to talk to people and listen to what they have to say, while disecting what is really going on behind a facade of knowledge such as Berg. So therefore, yes, I would enjoy talking to Moe Berg. He is a baseball player and I am a baseball player. He is a catcher and I am a catcher. We match up very well. I enjoy watching people and disecting what their true story is without any prior knowledge. Berg is a spy who can charm any person into revealing information. Berg is someone I would really enjoy listening and talking to because of his expansive knowledge of quite a few of the things I love. He could enlighten me onto how it is to hit a Major League fastball and what it's like to get caught in customs in Russia. Moe Berg is someone I would definitely hit it off with."}, {"userName": "Neil Pierson", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1186428-neil-pierson", "userReview": "After his career ends, a major league baseball player becomes a spy for the U.S. government.

A weak-hitting but quality defensive catcher who kicked around with various teams for over a decade, the enigmatic Berg would make his mark on another front when he served as a spy for the OSS during WW II and for the CIA in the post-war. Unlike most ballplayers of the 20s-40s (or perhaps any era), he was a Princeton grad, had a law degree from Columbia, and was multi-lingual. He was also Jewish which made him somewhat of a rarity both in the baseball ranks and at exclusive clubby Princeton at the time.  A truly cosmopolitan figure, he was part of the famous 1930s baseball tour of Japan on a team which included the likes of Ruth and Gehrig. He was often popping up in forbidden places taking photos which he would later claim were used in American bombing missions. During the war, he roamed North Africa and Europe and was one of the agents responsible for locating German scientists involved in nuclear physics. Because he was conversant with science and had his language facility, he was regarded as a prized asset by the American intelligence community. Unfortunately, he had difficulty explaining his rather exorbitant expense accounts and in a pattern he would continue in the ensuing decades, he would often vanish and resurface with no accounting for his activities. These were indiscretions which would later irritate his overseers at the CIA who eventually would terminate his connection with the agency. His mysterious lifestyle would be the focus of the author's narrative, sometimes to the point of tedium. The peripatetic Berg never held a regular full-time job after the war and basically existed on the largesse of sympathetic relatives and friends. His eccentricities and obsessions (always carrying a stack of newspapers and wearing the same style suits) and lack of romantic attachments made him even more compelling to a cast of admirers. Many of whom, as indicated, graciously subsidized his appetites and housing needs. It is with those encounters that an otherwise well-written book does flag a little as there are so many such episodes that a few examples would have been sufficient rather than a whole litany of such interactions. They almost all came to the same end, Berg would - for lack of a better word - mooch, then take offense over some trivial insult - real or imagined, and move on to the next benefactor. This biography was written in the 1990s and overall is an enjoyable detour from the usual sports biography with a minor reduction in the rating for the reason cited."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/662075-james", "userReview": "I'm knee-deep in research reading for an upcoming novel and I have stumbled across a fascinating book about a totally unique individual Moe Berg, the only Major League ballplayer with his baseball card on display at the headquarters of the CIA. Moe Berg had both a 15-year career as a catcher for such teams as the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Boston Red Sox and also as that of a spy for the OSS during World War II.Know as \"the smartest man in baseball\" as well as \"the strangest man ever to play baseball\" (Casey Stengel) and nicknamed \"The Professor\", Berg had a law degree and spoke several languages. Before he was officially employed by any spy agency, he secretly took pictures of Tokyo when he was on a goodwill baseball tour in the 1930s that were later used in planning Doolittle's famous raid.In 1944, the OSS assigned Berg to infiltrate Switzerland and work his way into a small group of academics allowed to sit in on a lecture by the visiting German scientist Werner Heisenberg. Berg's mission was to use his scientific background to assess if anything Heisenberg said hinted that the Germans were close to atomic bomb. If so, he was to shoot him then and there. He concluded there was little to the German atomic programming, befriending Heisenberg and later attending a dinner with him. What is astounding is that this was an invitation-only lecture and attendees were expected to discuss the scientific aspects - in German - which Berg managed to do quite well.He parachuted in Yugoslavia and undertook a number of other missions. A bit of an odd duck, he refused to take military rank, preferring the freedom his civilian status gave him within the OSS. After the war, he refused to accept the Medal of Freedom for his actions, never explaining his motivations. Moe Berg was one of those singular people who prove the adage \"you can't make this stuff up.\" Dawidoff does a great job of revealing - to the extent possible - the nature of Berg's fascinating character."}, {"userName": "Simmoril", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/117278-simmoril", "userReview": "I can't honestly remember how I came across Moe Berg's name, but when I first heard about him, I was immediately intrigued. A Princeton graduate, a polyglot, a professional baseball player, and an American spy, Moe Berg seemed to have all the makings for an exciting biography.Dawidoff's account of Moe Berg's life covers quite a bit of ground, detailing Moe Berg's baseball career, his work as a spy during WWII, and finally his decline in his later years after he was let go from the espionage business. Dawidoff gives the reader a great deal of insight into the secluded yet diverse world that Moe Berg built for himself, and he does a great job of really analyzing Moe Berg's motives for living his life the way he did.However, I must admit that I felt like I was plodding through this book rather than reading it. During the first half of the book outlining Berg's days with the Red Sox I can attribute my difficulties to my indifference to the game. But even in the later chapters where Dawidoff talks about Moe's days with the OSS, the deluge of details and side-stories just really stunted the allure of it all. The section talking about Moe's later, declining years was most difficult of all, as it was a 100-page chapter detailing anecdote after anecdote of Berg's time & friendship with this person or that one. I felt the chapter just said the same thing over and over again, without really revealing or explaining more about Moe Berg.I suppose part of my disappointment also stems from my expectations of this book, as I originally thought Moe Berg was a spy at the same time that he was a baseball player (which in hindsight now, seems like a somewhat far-fetched assumption).

Once Berg is cut loose by the CIA, however, the biography becomes as aimless as its subject's life, and the last third of the book, in which Berg becomes more and more reclusive and enigmatic, is scattershot and unsatisfying.

The first part is his childhood and baseball, the second part is the OSS and WWII, and the third part is about the strange man he became when his strongest ties (baseball and espionage) were cut. Berg comes across as an intensely private man made up of many fascinating contradictions, he always seems to be the thing that doesn't quite fit wherever he is. In baseball he was an intellectual and an academic, among academics he was a ballplayer, at Princeton and elsewhere he was a Jew, but among Jews he was secular.Dawidoff also makes clear how likable Berg could be.

Moe Berg was arguably the smartest man who ever played baseball. A graduate of Princeton in 1923 he became an anomaly in baseball -a college educated player sharing the dugout with a bunch of players who might not have even a high school degree. He managed to hang around baseball as a backup catcher for 19 unspectacular years. He loved baseball and being a part of a team and would have been lost had it not been for the advent of World War II. As a baseball player it was said that he could speak 7 languages and couldn't hit in any of them. However, his linguistic abilities came in handy during the war as he was able to use his background and his contacts to secure a position with the OSS, the forerunner of the CIA, and it's leader, William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan. His war time experiences took him to all parts of Europe that were free from Nazi domination trying to learn more about the German construction of the atomic bomb. As parts of Europe were freed from German occupation his mission was to recruit scientists to the US to assist in our construction of the bomb. By all accounts Berg was successful in his work but then a terrible thing happened. The war ended. Berg had not been the easiest spy to handle and when the OSS disbanded and the postwar world was being formed he found himself on the outside looking in. What followed was a tragic story of a highly gifted individual having to live off the kindness of friends and, in some cases, strangers for the rest of his life. This is where the book bogs down and the author offers a psychological study of Berg. I think it's pretty obvious that Berg was fouled up but I believe the author could have just presented the evidence and let the reader draw his, or her, own conclusion. Despite this, it was enjoyable reading about all the ballplayers he played with and the characters he encountered during the war. This is what Moe Berg should be remembered for."}, {"userName": "Bill Bow", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7997538-bill-bow", "userReview": "I am going to use a baseball analogy to describe this book; I was looking for a good spy story, but the author threw me a curve. Moe Berg of the Boston Red Sox was this very literate man who also happened to play baseball. Baseball in the days before divisional play was a very leisurely sport. You would take trains to the next town, get put up in a hotel room by the team, and, especially if you were the second-string catcher, enjoy a nice three-day vacation in a major city. It was perfect for Moe Berg, a man of mystery who charmed all of the people he met...sportswriters, university professors, and tourists, since Moe spoke many languages. Not fluently, but well enough to converse. He impressed many but left quickly, being careful not to overstay his welcome. He used this talent to get a job with Nelson Rockefeller, which led to a job with Bill Donovan and the OSS, which was struggling to find out whether or not Nazi Germany was going to beat the United States in developing the Atomic Bomb.There. That's the whole story. And you know the ending! We won the war. Now fill in the anecdotes. You probably have heard of Bill Donovan & Allen Dulles, but not Moe Berg. That's because he didn't find any secret plans, or blaze in with a .45 and kill any top Nazi scientists. That's Ian Fleming-style fiction. I found the book difficult to read because I wanted a spy story, which this is not. Moe is a strange and charming character; but, to get back to my twisted analogy, he makes you foul off a lot of pitches. Looking forward to the movie, which (hopefully) will have at least some semblance of a narrative.

But for some reason, his history didn't resonate all that much with me. Perhaps it is because of the element of fraud that surrounded his life. That said, author Nicholas Dawidoff does a good job of peeling that onion and delving into those insecurities, and I can't complain about the reporting he did on Berg's background.From the book:\"Once he got to Washington, Berg shifted abruptly from the gregarious entertainer to the man of mystery. Whenever he encountered people in Union Station or on the city street who knew him, he brushed past them, without a glance. 'It wasn't politic to recognize him,' says his friend from the OSS, Margaret Feldman. Berg did this in cities besides Washington, of course, but his ostentatious displays of secrecy were perhaps the most poignant in Washington, for in Washington was the CIA, the one place where it could be confirmed for certain that Moe Berg was a secret agent no more.\"For an accomplished man who was doing nothing and wished people to believe otherwise, spying was an ideal cover. Nobody could dispute it. For a private man who was loath to reveal anything about himself, spying was also an excellent means of warding off questions. Yet when Berg left the false impression that he worked for the CIA, it was not just a matter of petty dissembling calculated to save face and veil personality. It was also symptomatic of a man suffering a protracted bout of wishful thinking.\""}, {"userName": "Philip Cosand", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28795127-philip-cosand", "userReview": "Fascinating.

The author doesn't ignore Berg's professional baseball career, but suggests that Berg could have never been better than a third string backup catcher. In fact, as the book progresses, we find that the author believes Berg to be an almost complete fake in just about everything he did. He exposes Berg as a borderline schizophrenic\\narcissist whose selfishness, especially in later years, allows him to sponge off of others, rarely seeking employment beyond some sort of short-term odd job involving business negotiations. Berg is portrayed in his later years as a braggart and storyteller, and there is no doubt he told stories and exaggerated his adventures. During Berg's professional career he was known to the press and public as \"Professor Berg\" for he read voraciously, studied hard, even delaying reporting to Spring training to complete a year of college. In fact, even while playing professional baseball the man managed to earn a legal degree and pass the bar exam. No simple task. However, his practice of law was extremely limited. In the lat 1930's , physicists began to come up with the theory of splitting atoms, and one actually succeeded. The Scientific community was frightened by what their studies were now possible of creating. As the Manhattan project began, there was great concern that the Germans or even Russians were building an atomic bomb a well. Enter, Moe Berg, world traveler, now retired from baseball, and unlikely friends to a number of physicists. Berg is recruited to go to Europe (always \"safe\" behind friendly lines) and to visit his physicist friends and make contacts and to determine if there is an atomic project going on anywhere in Europe. Berg performs this task admirably. He makes contacts and travels, and appears in places in Europe where one cannot imagine. As an information gatherer, and one who understood physics quite well himself (he had several visits with Albert Einstein) he was capable of analyzing the data. Soon, he was able to reassure the OSS and the Manhattan project, that Hitler was not yet building a bomb. His one \"deadly\" assignment was to visit a lecture by a physicist in Switzerland and determine if this scientist was involved in building a bomb for Hitler. He attended with a gun in his pocket with the assignment of eliminating the scientist if it appeared he was doing so. Berg determined that the scientist not only was not involved in building an atomic bomb, but that this scientist, if pressed into service, would do everything he could to delay and foil the efforts to build a bomb. He was a loyal German, but not a loyal Nazi. Berg's post-war experiences with the CIA were not pleasant. Apparently, he was poor at keeping receipts, ran up huge bills at expensive hotels, and refused to account for the money. He told them to go on being bureaucrats, he was a spy, out in the field, risking his life regularly. One of Berg's exploits PRE-WAR-- had him visiting Japan and teaching baseball to Japanese. During this excursion, he claimed to have disguised himself, entered the local hospital under false pretenses, and managed to sneak to the top floor where he took films of the local harbor and surrounding city. When the war broke out, he turned that film over to the OSS and always claimed that the footage provided information for Doolitle's bombing missions... The author suggests that claim to be an extreme exaggeration, one that Berg repeated until the end of his life. The author is at his best describing Berg's odd behavior, disappearing acts, secretive manner, bragging about accomplishments, and his study of various languages. He works diligently to debunk some of the \"legend\" about how many languages Berg really spoke. Yet, at the same time appears to be in awe of Berg's linguistic dabbling, and provides anecdotal evidence of Berg's knowledge and proficiency being demonstrated over and over. The last part of the book, Berg's final years, is a scrambled Hodgepodge of anecdotes, primarily because Berg himself was an enigma. Trying to create a timeline of some of those anecdotes was likely impossible and the author makes little effort to do so. Instead, he creates confusion about Berg that seems suitable for a man who gloried in living a confused existence. Finally, the author makes a jerk of himself by attempting to use words not normally found in the English vernacular... It is almost as if he is attempting to demonstrate that his intelligence and mastery of language is equal to that of Berg. Here are some examples of words he uses in various places that forced me to go to a dictionary. If you know what they are without looking them up-- Well goodie for you... But I felt the author was simply trying to distinguish himself by their usage:sangfroid sibilantfilipquotidianingenuelugubrioussurfeitinsouciantnascentpenumbraThis was a difficult book to read, especially about the last half, as the author's disorganization of material shows. Further, the author suggests that Berg was driven to his eccentric behavior by seeking his father's approval, for his father never approved of his baseball career in the least. The author provides some letters between the two men suggesting Berg's compulsion to seek his father's approval caused him to be both bold and adventurous-- as well as one who exaggerated his successes and adventures from time to time. One gets the impression that the author began liking Berg and ended up feeling sorry for the man. Such an attitude was not helpful to the book's conclusion. Though, Berg's later life was indeed sad. Overall, an interesting, but difficult book to read. The author could have told the same story in half the pages and made it more interesting, but instead he sought to bog it down with his own assertions and exhibition of literary skill."}, {"userName": "Marybeth Edgecomb", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26068461-marybeth-edgecomb", "userReview": "The first half of the book was great. Really enjoyed learning about his college years and baseball years and how he was recruited by the OSS to spy during WWII. However, the book loses steam after WWII ends ... much as Berg did. He wandered around and did very little of note after the war ended. However, half the book is spent chronicling this time of his life. The stories are not told chronologically which also makes it difficult to follow. The author attempts to organize the years after the war by place where Berg spent time ... or the people he was spending time with ... but basically this part of the story could have been adequately told in about 1/3 the time. I finished the book only because I am stubborn and I was determined that this book would not beat me. I very, very rarely fail to finish a book, and this book came sooooo close to making that cut. Instead, I had to read it in spurts over many months."}], "description": "The only Major League ballplayer whose baseball card is on display at the headquarters of the CIA, Moe Berg has the singular distinction of having both a 15-year career as a catcher for such teams as the New York Robins and the Chicago White Sox and that of a spy for the OSS during World War II.
