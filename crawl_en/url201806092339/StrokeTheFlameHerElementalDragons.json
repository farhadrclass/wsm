I am totally hooked now and have been from the very first page where we are drawn into an incredible fantasy world that I wished I lived in. We get to meet Kira a seemingly normal girl until her twentieth birthday when everything changes. Four men are drawn to her whether they want to be or not and together they discover a destiny that none of them saw coming. I cannot get over the world building in the this book and the characters just made it even better. If you enjoy fantasy reverse harem novels and dragons then you really have to go read this.

Most of all she's tried to blend in, to not be noticed. That all changes on her 20th birthday when her fate finally catches up to her, set in motion by a strange encounter and a lightning strike. After several weeks of vivid dreams about beautiful men, the actual men start arriving in her village looking for her; all telling the same story. Jasin, the arrogant soldier. Auric, the scholarly prince. Slade, the protective blacksmith. Reven, the cold assassin. According to them, they\u2019ve each been chosen by the gods to become the next elemental dragons and Kira is their mate, the Black Dragon of the Spirit Goddess, the most powerful of all. They need to mate, master their powers, and overthrow the current Black dragon and her mates to right the lands. Stroke the Flame is a dragon-fantasy Reverse Harem. It's wonderful. The descriptive world-building, the complex characters, the multi-layered story are all nicely done. The pacing is perfect. The attention to detail is exact. There are attraction and infatuation but it's not insta-lust or insta-love. In fact, it's almost the opposite in two cases. It's a complicated dynamic with not everyone in agreement to being part of this mission or the relationships. Kira is a worthy successor to the Black Dragon. She's traveled every realm, she's smart, a fighter, kind, vulnerable, and caring. Her life has been forever damaged by the current dragons. Jasin is the man-whore of the group. He's bedded women in every town the military has passed through. This changes once he is chosen to be the Crimson (Fire) Dragon but his past still causes pain and distrust. Auric, The Golden (Air) Dragon is a nobleman by birth but of no importance to his family and more interested in his scholarly pursuits. He is smitten with Kira immediately. Slade is an enormous man with a bruised heart. He was content in his life and has no desire for change but once chosen as the Jade (Earth) Dragon is determined to do his duty for the world and protect Kira. He is equally determined to shield his heart from her. Then there's the assassin, Revel. He wants no part of being the Azure (Water) Dragon, no part of saving the world, no part of Kira. He is only interested in himself and has no plans to fulfill this destiny. Five strangers brought together by the Gods. Little in common. They have each felt pain in their past, either losing or disappointing loved ones but the only common ground they share is that they were each chosen. They set out on their path, uneasy, untrusting of one another, and with little control over their powers. When danger is immediate they are forced into a closer alliance but each gain is hard-fought. I enjoyed every minute of this dragon story. This book is the first in the series and while it does not have a cliffhanger the story is definitely in progress. It ends after the first bond but there is still much to do before facing the final battle. I eagerly await book two."}, {"userName": "Sian Jennings", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58863557-sian-jennings", "userReview": "Stroke the Flame is the first in Elizabeth Briggs new series Her Elemental Dragons. This novel is marketed as a \u201csteamy reverse harem\u201d fantasy, however it is anything but. I went into this novel expecting a lot of sex and not much plot, which I was more than okay with. What I got was lukewarm at best and damn cold at worst. That isn\u2019t to say this is a terrible book, it\u2019s not, it just didn\u2019t quite live up to expectations. Kira is a red headed huntress with a dark past. She is calm, competent, and able to remain uniquely feminine in her role as the hero. As a main character, she is wonderfully interesting and never comes across as being forced. We are then introduced to her four main love interests; Jasin, Auric, Slade, and Reven. If this was one of those novels where literally everyone was just getting it on all the time, I could have forgiven the two dimensional aspects of these characters. Each one can be reduced down to a single line, their stories barely interesting enough the keep the audience engaged. Jasin - The cocky soldierAuric - The clever princeSlade - The protective blacksmithReven - The mysterious assassin I thought the reverse harem aspect of this story would breath new life into what is a standard fantasy novel. The characters move from point A to point B with a few obstacles along the way that are easily overcome and nothing much, apart from bickering, takes place. The world Elizabeth Briggs has built is rich, though still doesn\u2019t feel fully developed. When it came to the world, I was left with way more questions than answers. A few simple throw away lines really would have helped to round this world out a lot more. My biggest problem with this book is that it never seemed to go anywhere. There was no real tension between the characters, there was no sense of urgency that their mission mattered, and at the end you\u2019re left with the feeling \u201coh was that all.\u201d It started out so strong, there was plenty to keep the reader engaged, but it soon became really boring, really fast. If the author didn\u2019t continuously change points of view the book would have been a lot shorter. I thought the perspective changes were really unnecessary and all they did was reinforce whatever it was Kira had said in her own chapters. A lot of the dialogue felt like it belonged in a screenplay, especially when the male characters interacted. \u201cLet\u2019s do this\u201d \u201cNo let\u2019s do that\u201d \u201cNO! LET\u2019S EAT\u201d. It almost felt like a choose your own adventure book and really brought me out of the story. This really is the white bread of books. It\u2019s perfectly fine but it was missing flavour. I really, really wanted to like this book. But I just couldn\u2019t. The best thing about this book is that it cured me of my insomnia. Which is unfortunate because Elizabeth Briggs has a wonderful writing style that flows so beautifully."}, {"userName": "Alimac ", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/70887872-alimac", "userReview": "I received this book as an ARC in return for an honest review!!On her 20th birthday Kira is hit by lightning and survives, little does she know that from this moment on her life changes completely: She has been \u201cchosen\u201d as the new black dragon to rule over the kingdom with her four mates.Kira has lost her parents when she was young due to the fire dragon burning her home and has been traveling ever since. She is strong, knows how to fight, is compassionate and stands up for what she believes in. Even though she is suddenly confronted with four men that she didn\u2019t know before and with the mission to bond with all of them in order to fulfill their fate, she doesn\u2019t shy away from the task and grows even more throughout the book. Her four mates \u2014representing each element fire, wind, earth and water\u2014 are not all happy with their new fate. But through out the book they slowly accept their role, the other men and Kira. We get little glimpses into the characters\u2019 past, and we can see that they all have secrets of their own and that they carry baggage with them, that they will hopefully all be able to overcome together!

The story was engaging with its medium pacing but picked up even better at its last 30%. The world building is simple, just enough snippets to cover the basics. The politics. The history. The system in general. As if it was easing me onto what would happen later in the series-the proverbial calm before the storm scenario. The heroine was such a beautiful mix of the strengths of each elements. The passion from the fire, the intelligence from the air, the kindness from the water and the stability from the earth. There was no doubt she was the representative for the Spirit element. She was also selfless to let any of them go if ever one of them did want to reject the role. (Because, yes, there was one from the men who didn't want the responsibility). But she was never too prideful to admit she did need them. The heroes were a bunch of...sissies. They were one colossal, chaotic mess. Their elements clashed at one another. But the series was just starting so I'd like to see them grow later.

That night the dreams begin and I like how we are introduced to each of the four men through her dreams before they all descend on her.

I couldn't put the book down until I finally reached the end.Kira is a wonderful main character. She's been living on the run and in hiding since the death of her parents. That all changes when she finds out she's got a big role to play in a destiny she's reluctant to take on. Not to mention, there's not one, but four guys who have also unexpectedly found themselves tied to Kira, and not all of them are happy about it.This book features chapters alternating between Kira and one of the guys' perspectives, though it's mostly from her POV. The relationships develop at different paces and it's mostly a slow burn with one sex scene near the end. There's no insta-love here, though the attraction is there. The book does not end on a cliff hanger, but is set up to lead into the next book in the series so I'd recommend waiting until closer to the release date of book 2 to read book 1 if patience is not your strong suit."}, {"userName": "T.", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9274125-t", "userReview": "Ever since Reverse Harem became a genre, I'm finding the books are gravitating toward the same personality types: bold/aggressive, shy scholar, strong silent-gentle giant, and anti-social-ass\u2026check, check, check\u2026and, check. As with all the numerous RH I've read in the past months, I'm annoyed by the bold, cocky hot-head, rooting for the shy-guy to gain confidence, loving the strong, silent, watchful lover, and hoping to uncover the secret to the resentful assassin. Most of all, I', wishing that, at some point soon, these guys will start working together to present a united front against their enemies. While the story is great and the plot fast-paced, the heroes are becoming tropes and the books are starting to blend with each other.
