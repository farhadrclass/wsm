You fold laundry and do dishes and cook dinner and copy and collate and draft and format and file for days on end whilst singing . . . . \n(By the way, I learned how to add text to .gifs so now the entire interwebs are my oyster)In what may be the most fitting title in the history of titles, Ugly Girls is about exactly what it says - U.G.L.Y. white trash. Now before anyone gets all up-in-arms about me libeling these poor innocents, allow this househo to explain the term . . . . \nIt has nothing to do with residing in single or doublewides. I\u2019m from Middle America \u2013 I know plenty of people who live or have lived in a trailer. No, Perry and Baby Girl (Dana before she decided to redefine herself and thug out) are morally bankrupt. They spend their free time jacking cars for joyrides before dumping them in the wee hours of the morn. Their friendship is one formed out of convenience rather than an actual liking of the other. And their most recent hobby????\nWhile the book spends time detailing not only each girl, but also their home lives, everything is a build up to when Perry and Baby Girl will meet Jamey, their internet friend. I\u2019m the first of my friends to have read listened to this, so I\u2019m not really sure how others will like it. I will reiterate that it is U.G.L.Y. If you are thinking there\u2019s some sort of redemption arc for these children, you need to think again \u2018cause it\u2019s just not the case. That worked for me here. Some stories just can\u2019t have a happy ending.I feel like it may have had a bigger impact if I would have read it too. Not only am I a total noob when it comes to audio books, but I can read a book this size in a few hours and really get wrapped up in it. Listening to it in 30-minute fits and starts increments over the course of a week probably didn\u2019t do it any favors. As this was only my second audio experience, I obviously can\u2019t compare narrators. That being said, Kathleen Early\u2019s delivery just was a little off for me on this one.ORIGINAL \"REVIEW\"My second audio book!!!!"}, {"userName": "Ryan Bradford", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1525100-ryan-bradford", "userReview": "A veiny, pulsing book.

Lindsay Hunter is the kind of fearless writer that doesn't give a shit about bestseller lists and happy ending. She revels in the sad undertow of her lost characters' lives and if you decide you can handle it, you'll revel in it too. This novel, Hunter's first, reminds me of vintage Harry Crews. It's so unapologetic that it becomes shake-your-head funny. And despite--or maybe because of--its blunt, hurried ending, you just gotta take some deep breaths when it's over and say, Daaaaaamn."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "I love Hunter's short stories; her style doesn't make the transition to novel length quite as successfully as I'd hoped. In Ugly Girls there are familiar elements of the author's work \u2013 the trailer parks and the Circle K, the grubbiness and dishonesty and queasy undertones of fucked-up families \u2013 but it's all dialled down, it isn't sprinkled with Cheeto dust and topped with whipped cream and crystal meth like it is in her flash fiction. Our ugly girls are Perry, pretty on the outside, rotten on the inside, and Baby Girl (formerly known as Dayna), willfully unattractive, and beneath that, a mess of insecurity and fear that's equal parts poignant and poison. There's also Perry's mother and stepdad \u2013 fading beauty Myra and soft-hearted prison guard Jim \u2013 and Jamey, whose entanglements with all four of the aforementioned form the engine of the plot. Since it lacked the colour I expect from Hunter, I wish there'd been as much to connect with emotionally here as there was in Claire Messud's The Burning Girl, with its not-dissimilar portrait of a small-town teen friendship collapsing beneath the trials of adolescence and family drama. There are some dynamite scenes, for sure. But by the end I was glad to be done with these characters.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/369169-lori", "userReview": "Listened 11/17/14 - 11/24/143 Stars - Recommended to fans of edgy, straight up trailer trash fictionAudio: 8.3 hoursPublisher: FSGNarrator: Kathleen EarlyReleased: November 2014Typical teenage girls getting into typical teenage girl stuff, only so much worse. In Ugly Girls, the writing was always on the wall of what ultimately boils down to the story of two incredibly incompatible BFF's who test one another, pushing each another from bad decision to bad decision, eschewing the consequences in lieu of the thrill of the moment, until that one final moment. The moment neither can take back though they wish like hell they could. Though you don't want to, you'll find the edgy, hard-core trashiness of the girls intoxicating. Baby Girl has made herself physically ugly, shaving her head, outlining her lips in a grotesque clown's mouth, donning her brother's old clothes, while Perry's ugliness is more behavioral, emotional, using her physical loveliness as a weapon. Home's nothing to get all worked up over. Both live boring, dead-end lives. Baby Girl lives with her uncle and struggles with the fact that her once handsome and devilish older brother has been reduced to a drooling, temper-tantrum-throwing five-year-old as the result of a tragic bike accident. Perry, she lives with her drunk-as-a-skunk mother, who never seems to care where she is or what she's up to and her step-father, a saint of a man for being able to put up with the two of 'em.Oh god, how this book brought the memories of my teenage years rushing back to me. For all intents and purposes, I was a fairly \"good girl\". I'd sneak around with the boys in the middle of the night, sure, slipping out the bedroom window like Perry did, my father never the wiser. I skipped school and chilled at friends' houses listening to music and watching them get high. A group of us would hang out in the local trailer park - skin heads and hippies talking about the ways they were gonna change the world, gawking at the strung out pregnant girls shoving ice cream and pickles into their junkie mouths. Making nuisances of ourselves at the local coffee shop, batting our under-aged eyelashes at the cute college boys who worked here. Cruising the main streets by the beach with the windows down, radio blasting, the wind in our ears, like nothing could touch us, just passing the time till something better came along. Unlike us though, to get even with the world for the bum deck they were dealt, Perry and Baby Girl get off on having fun at other peoples expense, joyriding in the middle of the night, stealing cars, skipping school and cutting classes. They even end up in the dunk-tank overnight for attempting to steal stuff from the local pharmacy. But all that becomes child's play when the two of them discover that they're both being chatted up by the same guy - a guy who has a serious crush on Perry. When the girls finally agree to meet up and show him what's what, that's where the real trouble starts brewing. And once they start that ball rolling, there's no stopping its momentum. From slow start to awkward and abrupt ending, Lindsay's multi-charactered novel is all about the ugly. The ugliness inside of us, how feeling ugly makes you act ugly, like there's no other way to be. Ugly Girls is a hopeless, grimy, gritty sort of novel that leaves you feeling as unwashed and skanky as its characters do and makes you thankful that you aren't raising teenage girls. Though now I feel I have to go and warn my teenage son about girls like them."}, {"userName": "Leah", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/663928-leah", "userReview": "Ugly Girls lays everything out in the open from the very beginning. There's no glossing over or pretty little bows. Instead, this is a story with a stark portrayal of two unhappy and bitter girls. There's no one to root for, no team to cheer on. At times overwhelming, and without a doubt tough, Ugly Girls held me captive. Despite the gritty feeling I had when it was over I enjoyed this one immensely and I do recommend it - though have a sappy love story on deck. Trust me, you're going to need kitten videos by the time Ugly Girls is through with you.For the full review and more, head over to The Pretty Good Gatsby!"}, {"userName": "Kerry", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4935386-kerry", "userReview": "I'm always impressed when an author creates a sense of dread that slowly builds through the whole book. 100% creepy and uncomfortable in the best way."}, {"userName": "Julie Zantopoulos", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51094260-julie-zantopoulos", "userReview": "This was not the book for me.

She's a strong writer -- that kind of modern seedy southern gothic that others like Gillian Flynn have brought into the spotlight, a trailer park freakshow, the protagonists two ugly girls from poor backgrounds. Unfortunately, the plot meanders, takes forever to pick up, and when it does, you're left with a really jarring ending that seems out of place and too sudden to even be called a \"twist\"."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14270260-leslie", "userReview": "I wanted to read a book about \"friends\" for a book club theme. This came up on my search (on Goodreads). What pained me most during my tedious reading experience is the idea that this may be labeled a YA book. I don't have kids but if I did I would not want my 14-year old daughter reading this book.The \"friendship\" between these two high school girls does not seem to be the focus. The whole milieu is one of boredom...poor white trash boredom. Kids cut school to steal cars and store goods they don't need. Mothers drink till they puke. Neighbors are disgustingly obese and emotionally coddle their adult children. Sex is ugly. Everything is ugly. There is no hope, no remorse...just a bleak landscape of damaged human beings.If there was a point to this misery, it was lost on me."}, {"userName": "Peter Landau", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/861304-peter-landau", "userReview": "Life sucks, and then you die. That\u2019s a fair description of this book, which plots the dead-end course of its characters to their sordid conclusions or leaves them on the edge of the cliff. It\u2019s not good and it\u2019s going to get worse. You could say its a microcosm for society at large and you wouldn\u2019t be too wrong. Fatalism is the ruling political party, not that this is an overtly political book. It\u2019s more a traditional narrative, set in the fairly untraditional place of a trailer park, and a slice of the people\u2019s lives who live there, which is cutting and sure to leave a mark."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10709651-matt", "userReview": "Wow.

In the hands of Lindsay Hunter there is so much more. If you\u2019ve read her collections, Don\u2019t Kiss Me or Daddy\u2019s, then you know how she balances the humor with serious issues, the longing with loneliness\u2014always seeking empathy, sympathy, for her lost characters, as in this case with two young girls.Perry is an attractive blonde who always gets the attention of men. Baby Girl is her opposite, shaving half her head, doing her best to push the world away. Both have baggage\u2014Perry, a fading mother who is a drunk; and Baby Girl with an older brother, Charles, who was hurt in an accident, now labeled a \u201cretard,\u201d just one more reminder of how the world takes away all that they love. Add into that mix the trailer park dangers, including a predator named Jamey who has a sordid past, and you have a recipe for disaster.The people in this novel are spot on representations of poverty, whether in trailer parks or depressed parts of this country, especially the rural south. I know people that live in houses where the rug pulls back to reveal a dirt floor, shooting deer in order to survive, not for sport but out of necessity, picking pellets out of your dinner plate, heading to the bootlegger on Sunday to get your drink on.This isn\u2019t just about everyone being rotten on the inside or showing that all of us have that the capability for ugliness. That\u2019s there of course, but it\u2019s more about desire and how those needs get us in trouble:\u201cSometimes Perry looked around and saw she was somewhere she didn\u2019t want to be. Sometimes it was sudden and sometimes it was because she\u2019d done shit to make it so. She could count on two fingers the number of times she was happy to end up in some backseat, but she couldn\u2019t say that she hadn\u2019t done everything she could to end up there. And like now. She hadn\u2019t meant for it to turn out the way it did. She wanted to go to school, even. But here she was. And when Perry found herself somewhere she didn\u2019t want to be, she rode it out until it was done, because it was the only thing to do.\u201cThe power in this story is not in the darkness, but in the raging against the dying of the light. It\u2019s about when the characters can make a decision that doesn\u2019t end up with a suspension, jail time, or worse. In every sentence of this book there is a chance, and even if it isn\u2019t taken, even if they don\u2019t all get out of this story in one piece, there was always that potential.Near the end of the book, Baby Girl gets shot, and she says it is a relief. She is tired of being the tough one, tired of standing up for her damaged brother, for carrying the weight. Perry finally goes to visit Travis, a boy she has a crush on, but she destroys any future with him by offering up all that she thinks she has to give. All of the adults want to be better and change things. They just don\u2019t know how.With Ugly Girls, Lindsay Hunter is not going to wrap this all up in a bow with every situation being better by the end. No, this is the truth, the way things often go down\u2014some making it out, some not; some learning their lesson, but most still wallowing in despair and failure. This haunting, touching, visceral story gets under your skin, and stays there. Whether we\u2019re born monsters or made into them, born damaged or fractured over time, the humanity in us just wants to be loved, to belong, to have a quiet, safe place to rest our head at the end of the day. That need is impossible to snuff out\u2014no matter how ugly it gets."}, {"userName": "Sian Lile-Pastore", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3281164-sian-lile-pastore", "userReview": "This is kind of a typical story about two girls living in poverty in America, hanging out, drinking, sleeping with boys etc etc it also has a mom who drinks too much and a disabled brother thrown into the mix. While the story is one I've sort of read before, I really liked the characters here - complex, real, relatable, and a genuine, believable mix of doing bad stuff but not being bad people. Particularly liked/was interested in Jim, who seemed to want the best for his family and be a decent guy, but then ends up with outbursts of violence. I also liked how I thought it was going to be just about the two girls but ended up being about their families. A touch bleak I guess, but ended up going places I didn't expect."}, {"userName": "Jason Pettus", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/147289-jason-pettus", "userReview": "Lindsay is an acquaintance of mine, so to avoid conflict-of-interest issues I will not be doing a formal review of her new book at the CCLaP website; but I did at least want to mention here at Goodreads that I had a chance to read the book for the first time last week, and that I ended up really loving it. A literal example of the overused term \"story cycle,\" this is a novel in vignettes that hops from one character's viewpoint and actions to a related one's from chapter to chapter (so from a Juggalo teen girl to her frazzled alcoholic mom, then to the mom's prison-guard husband, etc). Written in a poetic style that pays very close attention to every single word being used, I would expect no less from a writer like Lindsay who first earned her chops in the unforgiving world of Chicago late-night short-story readings and open mics.

The writing wasn't bad, but it read more like a student's work than a published author. None of the characters were particularly compelling, and the author seemed more interested in making the reader squirm than telling a story.

The ending is surprising and transcendent and the writing throughout is vivid and clean. Ugly Girls is gritty, but never strains to be so. These are hard lives, fully-rendered, and there is not a single, false note--not a single self-indulgent sentence. This book can be crushingly sad. There is one sex scene that is so bleak and believable, so fully realized and human, that I literally had to force myself to finish it. And Baby Girl is as realized and rich a character as I have read in some time--her own confused and matter-of-fact thinking about her own sexuality and experiences are heartbreaking and endearing, and again, very, very real.

With all their energy focused on deceiving themselves and the people around them, they don\u2019t know that real danger lurks: Jamey, an alleged high school student from a nearby town, has been pining after Perry from behind the computer screen in his mother\u2019s trailer for some time now, following Perry and Baby Girl\u2019s every move \u2014 on Facebook, via instant messaging and text, and, unbeknownst to the girls, in person. When Perry and Baby Girl finally agree to meet Jamey face-to-face, they quickly realize he\u2019s far from the shy high school boy they thought he was, and they\u2019ll do whatever is necessary to protect themselves.", "title": "Ugly Girls", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24675966-ugly-girls", "average": 3.2, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1422124465l/24675966.jpg", "reviews": 279, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3369554.Lindsay_Hunter", "name": "Lindsay Hunter"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Young Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24675966-ugly-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20613663-ugly-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31450596-eat-only-when-you-re-hungry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16059557-don-t-kiss-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7715816-daddy-s", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19421772-three-things-you-should-know-about-peggy-paula", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13552088-kitty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
