Writing is somewhat dry. Tarnished additionally by entire paragraphs being sprinkled through the work for no other purpose than to impugn the Bible as 'com[ing] from the merely human minds of a pagan civilization' (p. 914) which 'held the world in bondage to superstition' (p. 913) as long as people believed it, a view which was 'disproved by the discovery of the Epic of Gilgamesh' (p. 914), followed by a list of half a dozen 'plagiarisms' from that work in the Bible, to innumerable other, similar digs, including a discourse on communication with space aliens (according to the author, unfamiliar with Fermi, they're DEFINITELY out there) which have no place in an ostensibly scholarly work on a completely unrelated subject.Minus one star for both of the above, and dated and becoming more so (nothing on modern ciphers or their inventors, except for a brief mention of Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman in one sentence on p. 987) this would better be entitled 'A History of Cryptographers and Codebreakers to 1959'.Three stars. Two if you're interested in the cryptography or modern ciphers. Read Schneier, 'Applied Cryptography', Ferguson, 'Cryptographic Engineering', or Anderson, 'Security Engineering' instead. Singh's 'The Code Book' is much more recent history which gives computers more than a four-page appendix if you can do without the tedious, 70 pages of detail regarding the precise organizations and reorganizations of the eleven German intelligence divisions from 1933-1945."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2201886-mike", "userReview": "I read this book a a few years ago. It's fairly long and in places very technical. Translation: lot's of long and good examples of various codes and ciphers. It also clarified the distinction between a \"code\" and a \"cipher\", which i f you are like me, you probably thought were the same thing.Because of it's comprehensiveness and length, it's a somewhat \"daunting\" book to start, but the author knows his topic, writes well, and includes lots of interesting samples and uses of both codes and ciphers.There is another similarly-titled book that was first published only a decade ago (versus several wars) which may cover much of the same ground, but in less depth. I strongly recommend this book if you have ever wondered about how these things work and want a full history of the topic.I'm sure there are shorter, more focused books on specific methods and trends, but if you want a book that covers it all, read this one.

This is not an accident.* No one is going to attempt a detailed history of cryptology (notice the different word) like this for a very long time. Although I'm sure parts of it need updating as archaeology and historians break new ground, that's going to be a job few will be up for. We know a lot more about WW2 cryptology for instance, and the updated version which I own doesn't even scratch the surface of modern cryptology. You will need Schneier for that. Historical cryptology is a far more difficult nut to crack.* Kahn pays attention to the needs of the cryptographer, not simply the technique or technology. You would be hard pressed to find a better encapsulation of WWI cryptographic issues or the vital part that Friedmann and his amazing wife Elizabeth played in Prohibition and what that taught them.* More than that, it is extremely readable (and often funny), more than HF Gaines classic Cryptanalysis: A Study of Ciphers and Their Solution, which is for serious nerds only!It is probably the biggest book I own but worth it.

The Codebreakers is encyclopedic if not complete and Khan's knowledge is both thorough and entertaining. He is not the first to point out that the greatest codes ever made can and have been brought to their knees through persistence, good luck, and very often the ability to capitalize on human foibles. Solving ciphers is a mix of sweat and inspiration; creating them a remarkable affirmation of human ingenuity. Cryptography is essentially a mathematical undertaking as in y = mx+b. Code breaking involves both deductive and inductive reasoning, starting with analysis, hypothesis, prediction and finally ending in verification or refutation.The book is an interesting mix of both history and technique The book is a treatise and at 1000 pages covers some of everything.The Notes section is as additional 200 pages and I confess to skipping over large sections not because they were inherently less interesting but I do have a life! From Vigenere's archetypal system of polyalphabetic substitution to one time pads and microdots, the book traces the development of codes into the highly complex and asymmetric forms of D.E.S. and R.S.A that we have today.

At times boring, at times fascinating, it gives an in depth look at codes and code breaking through history. The book was published in the 1960s so the WWII coverage is lacking especially in regards to Ultra (this may have been corrected in a later edition) and the latest chapters chronologically, especially the one on the NSA should be 10 pages long, not the 30-40 that they are. In addition the author has a very triumphal tone with an Anglo-centric stance periodically that is particularly grating. Outside these issues the book is quite good at laying out both the nitty gritty of the codes themselves, the people that invented and cracked them, and their impact through history. The last few chapters are not specifically about code breaking, covering among other things translations of lost languages and code breaking in literature. They are however interesting in and of themselves. Worth reading unless and until someone comes out with a new, better written historical survey."}, {"userName": "Stephen Parrish", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3660750-stephen-parrish", "userReview": "Why anyone would give this book fewer than five stars is beyond me; THE CODEBREAKERS is the definitive history of cryptology. Its nearly 1200 pages tell the story of codes and ciphers from ancient Egypt to the NSA.As other reviewers have pointed out, this book is for lay readers, not professionals, not mathematicians and programmers---unless they too want to read a great story. It's not a how-to book. It is, as its subtitle suggests, a history of the subject.And it's a very engaging history. The research is breathtaking. Much of the narrative reads like a novel; a good example is the introductory chapter on Pearl Harbor. If secret writing fascinates you, if you've always wondered how ciphers were constructed, solved, and even hidden from view, you'll enjoy this book. It's a thorough exposition of an exciting and neglected subject, and it belongs in every reference collection.

I was distracted by frequent sexist stereotypes, but important female historical figures seemed to get pretty good coverage in spite of any cultural bias against them. The end is rushed compared to the rest, and the declaration that cryptography has come to close with RSA and other public key encryption uncharacteristically rash. These are small flaws in a tremendous undertaking that I've not seen the likes of on other subjects.The kindle edition is readable but could be much improved.

The opeining chapter is particularly gripping, dealing with the decryption of the Japanese diplomatic service's codes and ciphers during the run up to Pearl Harbor. The main plotline of the book follows the development of cryptology from antiquity up to the mid 1950's. The parts of this covering about 1300-1940 are very good. Unfortunately, the beginning deals with some very arcane topics, like Hebrew lyrical poetry. The last few chapters are very dated as well.

There's also a big problem with the flow of the book, as the same period is repeated again later, and not from an entirely different point of view, e.g. it would've been a lot better for the book to have a fully linear time line.The chapter on the Russian cryptography is also very bad and needs a good update.

For 4,000 years, fierce battles have been waged between codemakers and codebreakers, and the story of these battles is civilization's secret history, the hidden account of how wars were won and lost, diplomatic intrigues foiled, business secrets stolen, governments ruined, computers hacked. From the XYZ Affair to the Dreyfus Affair, from the Gallic War to the Persian Gulf, from Druidic runes and the kaballah to outer space, from the Zimmermann telegram to Enigma to the Manhattan Project, codebreaking has shaped the course of human events to an extent beyond any easy reckoning. Once a government monopoly, cryptology today touches everybody. It secures the Internet, keeps e-mail private, maintains the integrity of cash machine transactions, and scrambles TV signals on unpaid-for channels. David Kahn's The Codebreakers takes the measure of what codes and codebreaking have meant in human history in a single comprehensive account, astonishing in its scope and enthralling in its execution. Hailed upon first publication as a book likely to become the definitive work of its kind, The Codebreakers has more than lived up to that prediction: it remains unsurpassed. With a brilliant new chapter that makes use of previously classified documents to bring the book thoroughly up to date, and to explore the myriad ways computer codes and their hackers are changing all of our lives, The Codebreakers is the skeleton key to a thousand thrilling true stories of intrigue, mystery, and adventure. It is a masterpiece of the historian's art.", "title": "The Codebreakers: The Comprehensive History of Secret Communication from Ancient Times to the Internet", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29608.The_Codebreakers", "average": 4.19, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1492339589l/29608.jpg", "reviews": 54, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16679.David_Kahn", "name": "David Kahn"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "Science", "Science", "Science"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29608.The_Codebreakers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1362382.The_Codebreakers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8205464-the-codebreakers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/469890.Codebreakers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/470460.Seizing_The_Enigma", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1542740.Hitler_s_Spies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/632927.The_Reader_Of_Gentlemen_s_Mail_Mail", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/457215.Kahn_on_Codes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26114346-krav-maga-defense", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
