An empty vessel. The core of me is rotted away, and I can never get it back. There\u2019s nothing left to fill me but anger. There\u2019s nothing left for me to sense but pain.\u201d\n1 1/2 stars. What a weird, weird book. And not in a good way.A Darkly Beating Heart is about Reiko, a bisexual, American-born daughter of Japanese parents. As we are repeatedly told, she is \"full of hatred\" and longs for revenge. The book opens with Reiko in Tokyo, Japan, where she has been sent to deal with her issues after attempting to hurt herself. Seems like questionable parenting to me, but whatever. When she visits the historic (and fictional) village of Kuramagi, she finds herself pulled back in time into the life of Miyu - someone whose lust for revenge may be even greater than her own.Smith spends the first 10% of the book listing every Japanese stereotype and buzzword you can possibly imagine. Ramen, sushi, karaoke, manga, chopsticks, pachinko, Asahi beer, J-pop, playstation, kimonos, more ramen, sake, ikemen, cosplay, kawaii, shinto shrines, gyoza, white gloves, Gothic Lolitas, Final Fantasy, Malice Mizer, ema prayer boards, Suntory Boss, platform boots...It's very awkward. It feels like the attempts of an American author to convince an American audience that the book is set in Japan. Rather like Kristoff's Stormdancer, though maybe worse. I'm not Japanese and have never been to Japan, but I find it very hard to believe that everyone just eats ramen and sushi (or sashimi) and drinks sake. Every single day. Oh, and Reiko's father works in tech, obviously. But I think I could have overlooked that. The worst thing, for me, was how comically melodramatic Reiko's narrative is. The book doesn't give us reasons for anything for a long time; we are simply reminded every few pages that Reiko is burning with rage or some other dark/fiery/bloody metaphor for anger. She's unlikable and super angsty. Between her violent artwork and her like for black metal music, there's something so simplistic and cartoonish about her villainy. \n\u201cI will master Hideki\u2019s path of vengeance. I will make everyone listen to the dark pounding of my heart.\"***\u201cSo what if I like boys and girls? What if I don\u2019t like anyone at all?\u201d The darkness flashes through me - the rivers and rivers of blood. I raise my hand in front of me and imagine it drenched in red.\nJeez. Calm thyself, oh angsty one. The atmosphere of the book simply isn't dark enough to carry Reiko's inner narrative. It feels out of place and just kind of funny.As I touched upon above, very little is given up for a long time. I'm not a fan of most books that keep the reader completely in the dark until the very end - it's not compelling to me. I found it hard to care about Reiko when I had no idea why she was seething with hatred and plotting the deaths of everyone around her. And - to be honest - I still feel her reactions to be melodramatic and unwarranted. Everything is revealed in the last few chapters and the story ends rather abruptly. It's messy, and some things were too neatly tied up without being adequately addressed. For such a dramatic book, it was hard to believe it could just end like that.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "ak", "userReviewDate": "Jun 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5557238-ak", "userReview": "So I beta read this for Lindsay because it's about a Japanese American bisexual girl who goes to Japan and doesn't speak Japanese.

I love Reiko who was angry angry angry in a way I've never seen any girl in any book be and certainly never any Japanese girl (because we're all submissive AMIRITE????). Reiko's struggle with language and culture when she first shows up in Japan is something that resonated strongly with me.

The main character, Reiko, is brewing her own darkness and destruction. She was the master of her own downfall and she wanted to fall. But she wanted to bring everyone else with her. I loved how this book alternates between modern day Japan and Imperial Japan. After taking a humanities class all about East Asia, I was thrilled to read A Darkly Beating Heart, and I was not disappointed. Though the beginning was a bit slow but the middle and ending really picked up. I was flying through the pages towards the end. Miyu was an interesting twist to the story. She is full of rage and revenge, like Reiko. However, Miyu is a spirit that has inhabited others who share her rage and revenge. I found this aspect quite fascinating. Overall I really enjoyed this one. It is the perfect standalone about a girl wanting her revenge."}, {"userName": "Molly", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/913689-molly", "userReview": "Huge thank you to Macmillan for sending me an ARC of this book for review!Okay, so I know that this book doesn't come out until October, but I HAD to read it as soon as I got it. For those of you who DON'T know, I lived in Japan for seven years and I generally find a lot of issues with YA books set in Japan. I've kinda taken it upon myself to read them and pick them apart. So I went into this book both excited and leary because I don't believe that the author has actually lived or even spent a significant amount of time LIVING in Japan (I did read her author's note and she went there for a vacation, I know). That said I REALLY enjoyed this book. This is the story of a troubled Japanese-American girl who goes to Japan to stay with her Uncle and cousin while she tries to work out her issues. She's waiting to hear back from colleges and planning her own perfect revenge against... well you find out later on who and why, but for most of the book you just get glimpses at those who wronged her.Reiko is an angry girl. She's a cutter (trigger warning) and she spends A LOT of time thinking about how she's going to kill herself and get revenge on her ex-girlfriend, brother, parents, and later this extends to her cousin and friends. We find out that Reiko had a passionate relationship with a girl named Chloe who unleashed Reiko's dark artistic side. Reiko is swept up in Chloe's orbit and does thing that she normally wouldn't, which later gets her into a lot of trouble.While in Japan Reiko works for her Uncle's web design company and spends time with her cousin and the other employees who are also employed by the cousin, Akiko, who is trying to become a J-Pop idol. Akiko has her own lifestyle brand that she's trying to sell via her youtube channel, blog, cell phone novel and website. The other employees are basically her entourage as she tries to find ways to get her name out there. And Akiko's boyfriend, who is a washed up idol himself, gets Akiko a gig at a culture festival in a remote Japanese village.So the group travels to Kuramagi village where Reiko is swept away to another time, the Edo period, where she inhabits the body of a young woman who is filled with her own rage and revenge plots. Reiko loves being in Miyu's body and feeling all of Miyu's hate. At first, when Reiko time travels, she thinks that her antidepressants are making her crazy and she gets rid off them. But we later find out that something much more sinister is happening, something that happens every year at the festival, something that the village is desperately trying to stop.So the story was good, I really enjoyed it. As for the writing I thought that the whole\"I walk the path of vengeance, I must get my revenge\" parts were a LITTLE heavy handed. Like, we got it, Reiko is angry. And while I liked the glimpses of what had happened, and we do get the full story by the end, I was sometimes frustrated that I didn't have a full picture and was just filling in gaps and wasn't quite sure if I was even right.As for the Japanese aspects a lot of them were pitch perfect. My only two nitpicks are:1. Why in the world did Smith keep using the world \"pallet\" for a futon!? This boggled my mind to no end. She uses TONS of Japanese words (well) in the text with either direct translation or translation that follows not too long after. But the entire time they were sleeping on \"pallets\". And I really don't see why the word futon wasn't just used, defined, and then used for the rest of the book.2. Names. In Japan it's Surname followed by Given name. There are many different honorifics that are used much like Mr/Mrs, Sir/Ma'am etc. Usually these name conventions fall away around foreigners. In the group and at work they should have ALL been referring to each other by Last name + san. Instead they all use first names. I chalked this up to them being around Reiko and falling out of the convention because of her, but from my own experiences even around myself the Japanese people (especially while speaking Japanese) would not have used first names. So while Reiko was being called Reiko and using everyone's first names, Akiko would NOT have been calling Kenji by his first name unless they were VERY good friends and even then she probably should have added \"kun\".And then in the Edo period it was very odd that everyone was again using first names. Especially for Miyu who was so hated. And she would not have called Jiro by his first name from the very start. I'm not even sure if she would have used it after they got closer.So yeah, those were my only two real issues. The rest of the Japan stuff felt very authentic and true to my experiences as well as those around myself. I enjoyed that Smith didn't get too heavy with the \"weird\" Japan and that she really seemed to have a grasp on the lifestyle brand culture that Akiko was going for.

Net necessarily a bad weird, but not necessarily a good weird either.I'm actually very conflicted on how (what, I suppose) I feel about this book. On one hand, it was a unique and refreshing read, something I'd never come across before. On the other, certain aspects of the story, such as characterisation and plot, kind of irked me.Reiko is an angry girl. Things haven't gone well for her in the past and things aren't going well for her now. Ever since her ex girlfriend \"dumped\" her and got her in trouble, Reiko has been seeking revenge. And thinking about her death a lot, constantly saying it has to mean something.When her cousin forces her to go to Kuramagi, a sleepy if old-fashioned, village, some weird stuff begins to happen. Because she's not Reiko, she's Miyu. And it isn't the modern world, it's the nineteenth century.I don't know how many times I'm going to say this in the review, but Reiko is angry. Like, unhealthy angry. Like, I'm going to remind you twice, maybe four times, just how angry I am. And it doesn't even come off as edgy--it comes off as annoying.I get it. Life's dealt you a fair amount of shit and you sure as hell don't want to just take it. You're in a country full of your history and you don't know the language. You're surrounded by people you hate with every fibre in your being. You hate your parents for not caring, your brother for not being there, your ex for being horrible.But it got repetitive. It got strange. It got unnecessarily dramatic. It had me both eyeing the page oddly or rolling my eyes. Reiko came off as a really unlikable main character which makes me sad because it's not everyday where you meet a character like her. I mean, sure, you meet those full of revenge, but I was hoping Reiko would be a different character. And in the end, she was, but it wasn't a good kind.You find out more about Reiko's past as the story progresses and that was kind of weird, seeing as how Reiko also spends time as Miyu. I sort of understood why Reiko used Miyu as an escape, but at the same time, she just continually made things worse for her and for Miyu. Both girls are pretty fucked up but Reiko kind of just got free reign when she was Miyu. She made some questionable decisions and well, I did like that she thought about what she'd done after she got back to herself, but it was still a stupid move. Also, I kind of expected a bit more from the time travel aspect of the story. It was just simply going back and forth between modern time and the Edo period and that just didn't interest me enough.And that ending. What the hell? It was so abrupt, so quick and for a character who imagined blood running down her hands and everyone around her dying, that cookie-cutter ending was just a bad call. Everything was suddenly explained and everything went well and it literally made no sense to me. So, overall, 2.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Chelsea", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5489632-chelsea", "userReview": "Really dark and twisted Japanese time travel story. Looking for diversity in all forms? This is the book for you. We follow self-harming, suicidal, bisexual, Japanese-American, Reiko in this story. Did that cover all forms of diversity? I believe so. Reiko is one angry chick. She would have all ready offed herself if she didn't want her death to exact some serious vengeance on those who have wronged her and brought her to this point. Serious wrath there. So obviously we are dealing with some tough mental issues in this story about a 16 year old girl who, after a dramatic break up with her art camp girlfriend and some serious offense committed by her older army brother, is shipped off to her relatives in Japan to sort her shit out. (I'm going to leave that run on sentence in there as a tribute to my third grade self...get all the thoughts out in one breath tiny Chelsea!) While in Japan she follows her aspiring J-Pop star cousin around to video shoots and is all around mopey and dismal. When they go to a music festival in a small and run down town she somehow transports herself back into the body of Miyu, another angry 16 year old girl in the Edo period of Japan. After experiencing both her own miserable life and the lifestyle of a teenage girl who has brought shame upon her family in 19th century Japan she decides exactly how she wants to exact her revenge in her own life and attempt to continue on as Miyu. As her plan progress we learn more about what made Reiko the way she is and that Miyu may not be the better option and is in fact an even more bitter person than herself. Eery, dismal and off-putting, this story claws its way into your head and spits you out on the other side in the best possible way. I know this review makes it sound like a terrible experience but it haunts you when you're not reading it and it was also short enough to not push you into your own mental cycle.

Sticky Notes were the\u00a0answer. And while I did not tab the shit out of this book (or really any book because I am more of a reader than a note taker), I did tab a scene in this book and write OMG!!!You were probably wondering where I was going with the whole insight into my reading process thing weren\u2019t you? I AM SORRY. I felt like backstory was important just so you could kind of begin to understand the kind of book \n  A Darkly Beating Heart \nis. One that inspires OMG!!! stickies. Reiko is an unlikable MC. I did not like her for most of the book because she is not a nice person. She does not do nice things and has hurt people in the past just because she believed it was justified. To be fair, she has been wronged a whole lot in her short life but her approach to making things \u2018even\u2019 is NOT the best. The thing is, Reiko IS a well-written character. Even when it seems impossible to support or justify her cruelty, it is easy to understand her and see that underneath all the awfulness, she is just a girl who has been hurt by people who she should have been able to count on. This however is not the story of how Reiko realizes that she needs to deal with her feelings in a healthy way, at least not at first. Reiko\u2019s parents ship her off to Japan to stay with her relatives for the summer and hope that the change might help her feel less hatred in her heart. That doesn\u2019t quite work because when Reiko and a bunch of people are visiting the village of Kuramagi, Reiko gets transported into the life of Myu, a girl living in 1862 who has even more anger issues than Reiko does. Instead of being a tad terrified by Myu, Reiko is comforted by the anger and finds herself seeking out this alternative life more and more until well\u2026 that would be a spoiler. \n  A Darkly Beating Heart\n does have a PNR element to it and the transition into \u2018believing\u2019 is actually beautiful. Reiko is completely thrown off when she is transported in time but she connects the dots little by little and in a realistic manner so it was easy to believe her and even easier to get behind the whole time travel aspect (because the way it works in this book is a little odd). For those of you who like a little bit more sci-fic in your time travel and less paranormal, you might have that aspect of the book a tad unsatisfying because it isn\u2019t really explained. It kind of just happens and to immerse yourself in the book you have to let go of the fact that there is no real reason for why she is being transported in time (there is a pnr explanation but not anything more grounded in science.)There is a slight romance factor to the book that is important in some ways. Reiko has a crush on a girl who works at their bed & breakfast and when Reiko is Miyu she is in love with this dude (I am so good with names. I remember everythingggg.) BASICALLY Reiko has a love interest but no real romance which makes sense because Reiko really isn\u2019t ready to be in a relationship since she really cannot relate to other people. The best part about this book is the plot. I say this as a plot person though and there are LOTS of things to appreciate about this book. I love that \n  A Darkly Beating Heart\n doesn\u2019t necessarily fit into one genre category. Its got time travel, a little bit of a mystery, a coming of age, HORROR! The various elements work well \u00a0together without losing their essence (I totally feel like I am judging food right now) and are combined perfectly. I LOVE the nail-biting, fast-paced nature of this book and I love the horror aspect that makes me want to curl into a ball but most of all, I love the journey of Reiko as a character (does this make me a character person? WHAT? I am a confused banana). I do feel like this review is turning into a rambling mess so I am going to stop BUT you should definitely check this book out when it is out in the world and hopefully you\u2019ll love it as much as I did.

I was pleasantly surprised when I was given an ARC by the publisher and NetGalley, so this became an unexpected October read. Perfect for Halloween, because the book deals with a lot of darkness. A Darkly Beating Heart is going to be published next week, so now is the perfect time for a review.(I love this cover.)Reiko didn\u2019t go to Japan to enjoy herself. Packing herself away to a country where she doesn\u2019t speak the language, Reiko allows the rage she has inside about the events preceding her senior year to fester. Consumed by thoughts of revenge, she manages day by day only because she is planning how to best get back at everyone. Comfortable with her routine, when her summer job requires her to go to an Edo-period town in Gifu prefecture, Reiko initially believes that leaving Tokyo is the worst thing that could have happened. It throws all of her revenge plans out the window.Finding herself in a town with a curfew and deeply-rooted traditions, Reiko struggles with maintaining her revenge plot and coping with the anger that fills her head. Then she discovers a long-forgotten makeshift temple. It pulls Reiko back into the past into a time period rife with dangers. The connection that she feels with Miyu is immediate, her anger even more explosive than Reiko\u2019s. But Miyu is keeping things from Reiko. And if Reiko doesn\u2019t discover them in time, it\u2019s not just Miyu\u2019s time that will be affected.This is a book that is odd to review. Lindsay Smith writes beautifully; the scenes she creates are so vivid that it\u2019s very easy to see them in my mind\u2019s eye. The setting just jumps off the page. Of course, it helps that I live in Japan. This book isn\u2019t one that is \u201cset in Japan,\u201d where the setting isn\u2019t realized. This setting is, and I loved it. This would have made me really nostalgic for Japan had I already moved back.The world of modern day Tokyo and that of the Edo period were so clearly written that I had a very easy time picturing them. I\u2019m such a fan of the Edo period of Japan that I was thrilled to read a story set in it. Or half set in it. Reiko is connected to both, and the differences and similarities in the town she finds herself in\u2013and the times\u2013is done really well. I liked how they both kept getting closer together and the connections that were being discovered. Despite the speed of the plot, the setting was built slowly and when it made sense for the readers to be given the information.The writing itself is stunning. Each page seemed to have a beautiful description of a place or a spot on look at Japan or the characters that Reiko was spending time with. I was incredibly impressed with Smith\u2019s writing style. It wasn\u2019t too flowery or unnecessarily bogged down with details that didn\u2019t matter. It was an absolute pleasure to read. When I first started reading this I was sure that I would love the book. However, beautiful writing is not the only thing I look for in a book.That isn\u2019t to say the story or premise wasn\u2019t interesting. I just found that I was more interested in the Edo period parts rather than the modern day parts. While both are incredibly detailed, I\u2019ve found that historical fiction novels are increasingly becoming some of my favorite books to read. I understand why the plot was divided between the two times, but I ended up wishing that the novel was completely set in the Edo period and was about Miyu. That was the story I was really interesting in. Whenever it switched back to Reiko\u2019s point of view in the modern day, I was tempted to skim a little in order to get back to her.The connection of the past to the present in this little Gifu town was done really well. There are a lot of places in Japan that place importance on the past, but Kuramagi takes it to the extreme. Something isn\u2019t quite right about this town. They bury power lines (which actually does happen in some of these Edo-period towns), have a curfew, and place an emphasis on keeping the town as period correct as they are able. I liked that the town was the center of why the two different time periods were converging. I just felt like a great story was rushed.A Darkly Beating Heart is a relatively short story, and that is where it fell a little flat for me. Because it\u2019s short, a plot that I personally think should have been drawn out more feels rushed and half realized. In a book where the setting, writing, and emotions of the protagonist are written so well, a rushed plot (especially one that is actually really interesting) was disappointing. I did appreciate the element of Reiko missing half of Miyu\u2019s story\u2013I enjoyed that she only knew what she learned when she was in Miyu\u2019s body and had to figure out what she had missed when the story had progressed without her\u2013but ultimately I thought that it jumped back and forth too much without giving readers enough information about the two time periods and the conflicts in them.I thought that the way that Reiko was pulled back into the past was really well done. There\u2019s always an element of leeriness that I have when I go into a book that involves some form of time traveling, but I thought that the two story lines and the different time periods were perfectly intertwined. The time travel remained consistent throughout the story and it wasn\u2019t made overly complicated just for the sake of making it complicated. More is revealed as Reiko shares a body with Miyu and becomes more comfortable with the past and I appreciated the effort that Smith made to show that there are consequences for every action.Reiko as a character is\u2026interesting. The entire time she is plotting revenge: on her family, the people around her, her former girlfriend. Things have happened to her that are given to readers IV drip like, and that was part of my eagerness to read. I really wanted to know where all this anger came from, because I have never read a book where the protagonist is this angry. It was really uncomfortable at times because Reiko is constantly thinking about harming herself and others. Yet, I found myself continuing the book, despite this darkness. Her anger wasn\u2019t swept under the rug when it became inconvenient or when the novel ended. She is able to work through some things but also realizes that her life is far from perfect. But she learns how to manage her anger even as she still has it.It makes sense that she connected so quickly with Miyu because of her anger. Miyu also functions as a way for Reiko to understand that holding in all of that rage will consume her to the point of no return. Although Miyu is also a different character, because they shared had shared experiences I felt like they were the same. That\u2019s a reason why I wish the book had been longer. I think it would have benefited the plot to explore more of what Miyu was going through.Smith also had a handle on the sometimes dual nature of those who are bilingual. Reiko overemphasized the negative nature of bilingual characters because she is so blinded by her rage. Moments where Reiko is treated kindly (in English) but later is treated cruely or like a child (in Japanese) is unfortunately familiar, though rare. This is an element of passive-aggressiveness that foreigners sometimes experience. However, I do think that Reiko is being overly judgemental and Akiyo and Mariko are viewed harshly through this lens of anger she has. Reiko reconciles with this issue by the end of the novel, suggesting that much of her interactions with these characters had been so tainted by anger that she wasn\u2019t getting a proper read on them. There was closure with the promise to try harder to resist these moments in the future.A Darkly Beating Heart had amazing words that had it sitting at a 5 star rating. Due to the rushed nature of the plot and what I believe could have been a longer story, I\u2019m rating it a bit lower than that. I really recommend this for readers because it does have a very vivid setting and an interesting story that is plotted well. The only caveat I give is to be prepared for Reiko. Maybe I don\u2019t read many stories with dark protagonists, but her nature was hard to read at times.

Her style fills this book with compelling imagery and atmosphere, making even the downbeats contribute to the sense of consistently growing tension as the story progresses.The main character, Reiko Azumi, is a hard and brittle person -- a girl with a lot of damage, who reacts with anger to even the slightest of provocations. I LOVE characters like this. Dark, barbed, and antisocial, she is deliberately difficult to like in the traditional sense; but from page one, Smith engages the reader in Reiko's entrenched resentfulness, making you care about her, and making you like her in large part because she isn't soft or warm or uncomplicated. There's a pernicious mentality in YA lit that expects female characters to fall in line with the Manic Pixie Dreamgirl trope, and it is so, so refreshing to find a heroine (antiheroine?) that is all unapologetic sharp edges and messy internal conflict. It's also really great to see a bisexual protagonist whose attraction to both men and women is explored with frankness and accuracy.Last but not least, I cannot say enough about how thoroughly Smith immerses her reader in HEART's fantastic setting. She really brings Japan to life on every page, both in the contemporary parts of the novel and the scenes set in its Edo-period history. As someone who lives to travel and craves writing that transports me to new places, this was such a rewarding read."}, {"userName": "joey (thoughts and afterthoughts)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26565437-joey-thoughts-and-afterthoughts", "userReview": "Nope.Made it 124 pages in.

I was actually never sure what to think about it until well near the ending. Until everything came together. Because I couldn\u2019t see what this book was trying to do until all of the pieces of the puzzle clicked into place. Whether it\u2019s because I didn\u2019t understand a lot of the Japanese culture and references in here, the unreliable narrator, or simply the talented writing, I\u2019m not sure. But when it all led up to that ending, I could see exactly how good the book was and how the storyline that blended the past and present shined. Like I REALLY enjoyed A Darkly Beating Heart a lot! It took a while to get into the story, sure, but once it got going, I was hooked. It was super intriguing, and I know that\u2019s at least 50% in part because of the voice.The main character, Reiko, is not an easy person to like. She\u2019s unreliable, mean, and is mentally unstable. And she\u2019s so, so angry. Her rage is a living thing, a dark presence in her life. It affects not only her, but everyone else in her life. But she doesn\u2019t seem to get that; and if she does, she doesn\u2019t care. She\u2019s a narrator you can\u2019t exactly trust, because the way she views the world is so narrow and focused on herself. She wouldn\u2019t take responsibility for her own actions, and you don\u2019t even learn all of the things she\u2019s done until the last 30 pages or so. But I liked her character a lot, could even relate to her a bit, with her need for control and her anger at the world. And because she also had depression, it affected her even more. So much so that she almost destroyed everything around her based on a need for revenge that wasn\u2019t even completely hers.When she is pulled back in time, Reiko finds herself loving the past more than her present. She starts to want Miyu\u2019s life. She starts to fall for a samurai named Jiro and wants to spend more time there than in the present, but how much of that was Miyu and how much of that was Reiko? I have no idea. I was really confused on this supernatural aspect to the story. It seemed as if Reiko still had control when she was in Miyu\u2019s body, but I wasn\u2019t so sure, and it didn\u2019t make much sense to me if she was. I wondered why there was never any conflict when Reiko was there. But things became clearer near the end, when the truth behind Miyu\u2019s story comes to light and Reiko realizes that she\u2019s kind of been played by this vengeful girl from 1862. Their rage was so intertwined that the main character couldn\u2019t see her way out of it until it was almost too late.I honestly preferred the past pieces more than I did the present. I found the present to be incredibly boring, more so because I didn\u2019t like any of the other characters there, except for Kenji. They didn\u2019t understand Reiko, and I can see why, given how she acts and what she says. And given that she\u2019s kept a lot to herself, and as the readers come to realize, she\u2019s unreliable as a narrator. So how Reiko perceived the world and the people in it could not be trusted 100%, but I will say that Akiko and Merika and Tadashi were awful and selfish people who did not treat Reiko like a human being who had her own feelings. Ugh, such jerks! Anyway. I didn\u2019t much care for them, nor about what was going on in modern day Kuramagi.The combination of the past and the present was so fabulously written. Parts were confusing, because I didn\u2019t always understand who was in control: Miyu or Reiko, and you don\u2019t get the full history until well over the halfway point. Even by the end, I\u2019m not even sure I understood everything that had happened because the fast pace of the story made the ending that much quicker to unfold. And I don\u2019t know much about Japanese culture, so the beginning was hard to get around. But once the story started to play out, I couldn\u2019t stop reading. And I really loved the ending, how Reiko came to realize that vengeance was not the answer, that she didn\u2019t have to be so angry. That she was only going to perpetuate the cycle of violence and pain. This story was about a girl who just wanted to take back control of her life and live more freely./b>Rating: 4 Paw Prints!"}, {"userName": "Sam", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1559491-sam", "userReview": "Huge thank you to Raincoast for this ARC!I love books set in Japan despite having never visited. There's always something very atmospheric and lore driven, which A Darkly Beating Heart follows to a tee. I loved how well put together the story was, I thought the characters were very interesting, and the use of time travel was something quite special given our heroine goes backwards in time.I loved Reiko and I thought she was a great character. I feel like we get such a huge sense of her emotions, her desire for revenge, and how she is struggling to define her anger given her circumstances. I also loved the Miyu half, because I think it perfectly manifests angry and aggression in a way that feels almost symbolic given Miyu's story. They were a neat fusion of characters, and I liked how Smith blended them together.I also thought the way idol culture was presented was really interesting here. Aki comes across like quite the nutjob at times, but it's because you spend a lot of the story seeing her as her brand rather than a person. She's malicious and calculating at times, but it's interesting because you see it more from her being a businesswoman than just that type of person outright. It also doesn't help that certain characters really pander to her branding, which made for some great moments in the story. Personally, I liked Kazuo. He likes the PlayStation Vita, which makes me happy given that no one seems to love the Vita.While I think the ending wraps up a bit too neatly, I do love this story and I think Smith has a knack for doing balanced research and transforming it into an interesting narrative. I loved reading her Author's Note where she explains where her inspiration came from, as well as the extent of her research went.

Yeah, you can bet I got excited.Then I read it and I'm still wondering... WTF JUST HAPPENED.A Darkly Beating Heart tells the story of Reiko. Raised American with Japanese heritage, she has a lot of personal issues going on (ANGER issues) and flees to Japan to escape. Not that her time there is much better as she caters to her bratty cousin Akiko. Events move forward, they end up in this historical village Kuramagi where things turn weird. Like really weird. Mega-weird.From a writing standpoint, Smith has a easy to follow style and led the story through its paces. I can't say it was particularly remarkable but I can't fault it. The storytelling, however, is another matter. The world unfolds in the way I imagine a tourist would narrate a foreign country. I attribute this to the fact that a lot of people, like myself, have likely not been to Japan and this narrative provides a way to immerse oneself into the world. Instead of authentic, though, I found it a tad annoying the way phrases were thrown into large sections of pure English dialogue.But allow me to lead you into the heart of this book and my primary reason for almost DNF-ing it at 10%:\u00a0Reiko.So I mentioned that I was told this is the perfect book for InuYasha fans. Time-traveling to feudal Japan? Sign me up! And I\u00a0so wanted Reiko to be the Kagome of this story (she's a protagonist from the anime). But Reiko wasn't likable\u00a0at all. From the very beginning she's full of hate, anger, and a whole bowl of negativity. This book addresses a few trigger topics including suicide and self-harm so that is my warning on that front (though I think it handled them well). Reiko has a lot going on but what comes across is her anger.So angry.Like she talks about getting her vengeance on others.Needing that revenge.Always angry.And I say all this because if I went through this book, I would bet that her anger and need for revenge is mentioned every other page (maybe even more often). Reiko is a\u00a0dark, DARK\u00a0protagonist and I think it would've worked if the other characters hadn't been so unlikable. You know, I could've been rooting for at least\u00a0one\u00a0of them, then. But let me break it down for you:In modern day Japan, we have Reiko, who I've covered as being\u00a0very angry.\u00a0Akiko, her cousin who is an absolute brat and horrible person (please, the amount of times I wanted to slap her was too damn high).\u00a0Mariko, Aki's quiet sidekick who she bullies but follows her around anyway.\u00a0Kenji the artist trying to keep the peace and, of course, has feelings for Rei but it only really comes up once and not in a romantic way.In feudal Japan, there's\u00a0Miyu. She's Rei's counterpart and also (wait for it) full of anger and hate and seeking revenge. Rei finds herself in Miyu's body by accident but keeps seeking it out as a release from her regular life. And for most of the book they're the same person.Now let's take a moment to look at what's happened:We have a young woman who has serious anger issues, a mysterious violent past with both her ex-girlfriend and brother, and now she's inhabiting the body of another seriously troubled young woman from another time. Every page shows how dangerously close Reiko is to the edge. She's angry. She will have her revenge. She's angrier. Soon. You must wait to take your revenge.Over and over and over.I felt like I was watching an anime-telenovela crossover with all the dramatic moments of \"passion\" in feudal Japan and murderous plotting in the present day. I'm sorry but this is neither InuYasha or Jane the Virigin so I'd like a little less of the \"lets make everything go to shit all the time\" please and thank you. Reiko kept escaping into the past and went unchecked in terms of her actions. And through all of this there's this overlying idea that there's too much unknown about what happened to Miyu (too much to really keep me invested in either character).And then there's the ending.\u00a0What. The. Fuck.I just spent like 250 pages listening to how Reiko is angry (want to bet how many times I've mentioned that already? annoying, right?) and is planning this big revenge to get back at everyone who's ever wronged her. And clearly Miyu has her own issues to contend with that are seeping into Reiko's life. Then, in those last pages, suddenly everything is fixed and Reiko the angry little child she is finds a happy ending.I'm sorry but WHAT??I felt cheated as a reader. Instead of being a satisfying ending it was rushed and way too sudden of a change after the build-up. You want me to be in this character's head for almost 300 pages but then she does something completely\u00a0out of character... yeah, gonna\u00a0notice that. And perhaps with a more drawn out ending and Reiko's character arc being woven into the story more instead of the whiplash finale it was, I would've thought more of this book.The worst part of all of this was I REALLY wanted to like this book. I tried so hard and that kept me reading despite knowing early on that it just wasn't going to work for me. So end rant. I will certainly read other books by this author but this one's out for the count."}, {"userName": "Vicky the Cat Lady", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17388126-vicky-the-cat-lady", "userReview": "[\u201cThe younger sister [Miyu] --that demon-- she doesn\u2019t drink the poison.

The story follows Reiko, an angry, depressed Japanese-American teenager who moves to Japan for the summer to \u2018work out her emotions.\u2019 Reiko is an extremely dark character, she\u2019s been hardened by some of her more traumatizing experiences and is quick to react with anger to any situation. We learn about her past as her narrative continues, but we learn that most of this trauma comes from being scorned by Chloe, a past girlfriend, and her estranged relationship with her brother. In Japan, Reiko travels to the historical village of Kuramagi with her cousin Akiko and her budding J-pop band to attend a festival. Hellbent on revenge, Reiko wants to ruin Akiko\u2019s time in Kurumagi and it is also insinuated that she will commit suicide. As she creates her plan she simultaneously finds herself slipping back in time to 19th century Japan in the life of Miyu. She finds the Miyu is just as keen on revenge as Reiko and both of these stories unfold over the course of the book.Reiko is an intriguing character. From the beginning of the book I could tell she is not your normal love-scorned teenager. She is much darker than that and most of her imaginary scenarios involved bloody, destructive revenge. Her thoughts were so dark and disturbing that I think she may have had other issues before all of the emotional trauma with Chloe and her family. While I found it hard to relate to her, I was intrigued by her character and wanted to learn more about her thoughts and desires, as disturbing as they were. For a while, I couldn\u2019t even tell if the entire storyline with Miyu was even real or if it was just Reiko\u2019s imagination.Some aspects of this book were incredibly unique and refreshing to read. I enjoyed the insight into the Japanese landscape and culture in both present day and 19th century Japan. Smith\u2019s writing was colorful and imaginative and at times I felt like I was right there with Reiko in the strange village of Kuramagi. Reiko is also a bisexual character and I really like how directly and candidly it was explored in the book.I also like the way the time travel was handled, it was subtle and more of a \u2018slipping back and forth\u2019 between time so we got to experience dual story lines. The mechanism of time travel is only vaguely explained so the entire book had a certain mystical, mysterious quality to it. Miyu\u2019s character is also extremely interesting. She lives in 19th century Japan during the shogunate rule in militarized Japan. Miyu is treated poorly by her family and the entire village, but we do not learn why she is so hated until the very end. Her story absolutely had me guessing and it was both thrilling and disconcerting to read. While the story was intriguing, the climax and ending was too abrupt for me. I had so many questions throughout the book and suddenly everything was answered and the story ended. The book was delightfully bloody, vengeful and disturbing so I had a problem with all of the loose ends being tied up so neatly. I also have a hard time with the idea that Reiko is just going to go back to living normal life. I wish there was more of an explanation after the climax and this unfortunately seriously hindered my overall enjoyment of the book. While it was unique, I don\u2019t think this will be one of my most memorable reads. Overall, this book was an interesting read and I encourage you to try it out if the premise intrigues you. While I did give it three stars, I do think this book will really appeal to some readers."}, {"userName": "Shannon (It Starts At Midnight)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8652150-shannon-it-starts-at-midnight", "userReview": "You can find the full review and all the fancy and/or randomness that accompanies it at It Starts at Midnight There were lots of things I really enjoyed about this book, and a few that I didn't as much. But I think overall, the good outweighed the bad for sure, so that is a win, right? Let's break it down!\nThe Good:\n  The setting! Japan is a bucket-list travel destination for me, so I was tickled to see a book set there! Also, it made me really want sushi, because there was a lot of food talk in the book! But yeah, the setting was phenomenal, I loved that aspect for sure. \n   Since it was set in Japan, there was\u00a0cultural diversity of course, but that wasn't even the only diversity in the book! There were some LGBT+ themes too, which was such a win! While I can't speak on a personal level about the representations, it appeared to be incredibly well researched and thought out. \n   The historical part was\u00a0fabulous. I think I liked that part of the story more than the present day, in fact. I was so drawn in by the Japanese history, and the commentary on the role of women in that time period, and I was so invested in the outcome of that storyline. \n   I was definitely kept guessing! I wasn't sure what would become\u00a0of Reiko and her anger and self harming behaviors, or even what the catalyst was/would be. I also was definitely interested to figure out how/if the whole historical storyline would impact Reiko's modern day life, and of course how that particular story would wrap up too. \n   \nThe Not as Good:\n  Oddly, I think this book could have benefitted from more pages, which is something I almost never say.\u00a0\u00a0But by the end, I felt like there was almost too much I was a little unclear about, and that left me wanting a bit more. Both with Reiko as a character, and with the plot, I felt like they could have been fleshed out just a bit more. \n   I didn't quite understand Reiko. Maybe that's a good thing, because she is one dark character. She is very unhappy, that is clear, and she seeks revenge on anyone she's perceived to have wronged her in some way. I just never got a real sense of\u00a0why. I mean, yes, I get that she is just a generally unhappy person with some very clear issues. But the whole need for vengeance was something that\u00a0I simply didn't understand about her character. \n   The ending left me a little confused, honestly.\u00a0I won't say anything more, but just be aware that it did. But maybe you won't be confused, and then you can explain it to me? Great. ;) \n   \nBottom Line:\n I changed my rating on this about ten times- I went back and forth between 3 and 3.5 stars over and over. Let's say it's like, 3.25? I liked it, and I think had I felt a little better about the ending, it would have been a sure win, because I loved a lot of aspects about this book.
