It addresses the fact that many who call themselves christians are living a life contrary to the life that God wants them to live. Many are caught up in the politics of religion yet have no real relationship with god. Jaunita breaks down the philosophy of what it is to be saved and receive a new heart and what we can do about it.Quotes....\"You are maturing when you are the first to apologize, the first to keep the peace, when you are the first to say ' What did i do wrong?' rather than nailing the other person to the wall for what they did.\"\"if you do not have a real relationship with Him, then you merely 'appreciate' Him for the life and breath that He has given you. You are grateful for the way He makes for you out of no way and for all the things he permits you to have. but you are still operating from a materialistic standpoint -- and that is not real love. it cannot become real until you become committed and submitted to his ways.\"\"when you start doing ungodly things and yet try to justify why you are doing it, your moral understanding is darkened, and your reasoning is beclouded.\"\"Transformation takes place when our minds are brought to the understanding that we need God.\""}, {"userName": "Sharmaine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395746-sharmaine", "userReview": "The book breaks your heart down one compartment at a time.

I have been able to find myself within the first couple of chapter with areas I been having problems with. Juanita Bynum is a powergul woman of God. I love reading her books because while being looked down upon by critics, she still continues to tell the TRUTH. She puts her whole being into her books and doesn't care what anyone has to say about it. I will continue to read her old and newly coming books because they continue to amaze me with the Hell that she went through, but through it all, she was able to overcome her struggles!"}, {"userName": "Sherry Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/318871-sherry-robinson", "userReview": "I love this book!!
