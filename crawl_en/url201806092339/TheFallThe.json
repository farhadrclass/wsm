The suspense of not knowing how or when the full attack will happen, or if we'll be able to stop it in time. I was surprised by the religious tone, but then found at the end it was written by two pastors. The story is amazing no matter what your religious preference. What also got to me was that this could truly happen.

A computer hacker for the FBI, a CIA operative, a military chaplain, a Russian women, both good and bad political figures and a Prophet.When the President was warned about the downfall of The United States, he had to decide if it was a serious threat or just another unstable person writing a warning. Things become clear that there is something happening. This is a face-paced book with a lot of action and great scenes from around the globe. All of the threats and tragic events that unfold through out this book are things that could really happen to The United States or any other nation.I do not want to give too much away. When I received this book in the mail it was a lazy day for me. I read about the authors and then again the back cover. I was somewhat skeptical on if the book was going to be any good. I ended up reading the whole book that day and I am now wanting to see what happens in the next book. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a page turner on spies, wars, and battles between nations. It does have God and questions of faith and I am truly impressed at how well the authors pulled everything together. I can't wait for the next book to come out because I am going to read it.Notable Quote:\"Plumes of black smoke rose into the sky from devastated buildings. Bridges and highways melted into a pile of searing red metal. Ash and debris covered the entire landscape.\"Want to know how this came to be? You will have to read the book. It was great.

I entered for this book based on the synopsis of a suspense/thriller. Had i been in a bookstore or library leafing though the book jacket or pages, I would not have entered this contest, however, as a winner i read the book and now fulfill my obligation of writing about it. The book is a message book of an ideology of the authors. The story is not plausible, what fiction story is, but not only do you have to suspend your disbelief but you also need to check your freedom of thought at the front door. In theology there are so many areas which can be explored intelligently and with open thought but here the authors choose the simplest explanation possible. I'm not sure who the author's are trying to target here but it seems to be people who already share the same viewpoint as they do.I guess I'll continue to enter giveaways cause who doesn't like to receive books but sometimes you realize nothing is free."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/333533-andrea", "userReview": "3.5 stars.When the president of the United States receives multiple warnings for the country from a man called the Prophet, he enlists the best from the CIA and the FBI to get to the bottom of the situation.

Here is a novel that defies any certain description; it is packed with the message of Jesus plus themes, characters, etc\u2026 I can tell you that this book is riveting with a whopper of a storyline. You\u2019ll have to decide for yourself what that is by reading this book.\tThe geography in this novel is global though most action takes place in Dubai, the Unites States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. The protagonists are from all the countries mentioned; the antagonists come from the same regions too. There are believers who are weak in the faith and must choose what to do now that the unthinkable has happened. Some of the believers are reaching out and speaking unashamedly about the need to repent, seeking God with all their hearts.\tAs a teaser, the novel has a lot of action, adventure, spies, assassins, and those who commit treason. All agencies of the Armed Forces are represented in this novel as the President has been receiving messages from a source known only as the Prophet. The Prophet has been telling the President he must call the United States to repentance before the Lord unleashes his chastisement. The President is a strong believer who knows God has called him to lead this great nation, but is the Prophet for real or something else?\tDifferent characters in the Executive Branch are supposed to be working together to help America, but there is one woman in a position of extreme trust who is about to be found out. She has been doing the unthinkable. An FBI specialist named Megan is a computer genius and she has been more help in tracking down those doing evil than anyone is aware of. Jon works for the CIA. His military record is exemplary, but he is so angry at God that all he wants to do is catch the Prophet, not looking at the bigger picture let alone acknowledging God. Boz was in the armed forces before retiring and becoming a pastor, and he is a very close friend to the President. Boz knows more about the other people he is working with then they themselves know.\tNow there is a more imminent threat that the United States cannot handle alone. Other foreign nations want no part in helping the United States in their hour of need for fear that the enemy will then unleash unrelenting evil on them. So what happens to the government, the people, and those who serve America when all Hades breaks loose? I can\u2019t tell you anymore. You are going to have to grab a copy and read this excellent work of fiction. Plan to sit and read as the story reaches out from the pages and pulls you in. The chapters are short, which makes it easy to put it down if you have to, but you aren\u2019t going to want to! Wow, enjoy the adventure when you read!My rating is 5+ stars!Note: I received a complimentary copy for an honest review of this book. The opinions shared in this review are solely my responsibility.

The action then moves back in time by two weeks, to President Calvin Grant. Grant receives a message from a man calling himself The Prophet, claiming to speak on behalf of The Lord Most High. The message claims that God is going to punish the world for its evil, starting in fourteen days. CIA agent Jonathan Keene is teamed with FBI agent Megan Taylor and ex-special forces man Bozwell Hamilton to find and stop The Prophet. Keene\u2019s immediate reaction is that The Prophet is a terrorist, but Hamilton and Grant are strong Christians, and they aren\u2019t so sure\u2026 Well, we already know from the prologue that they don\u2019t succeed. What they do find is a bigger plot that could destroy America, and they don\u2019t know where The Prophet fits in. For the most part, The 13: Fall is a sound thriller with a good level of suspense and an interesting cast of characters who are introduced appropriately. But there are occasional literary mishaps, like unnecessary background descriptions, an overuse of exclamation marks, and scenes that felt as if it came straight from an old action movie (specifically The Fugitive and Matrix). And despite the fact that it is set in 2025, there don't appear to have been any major leaps in technology (well, all the police have smartphones, but this technology already exists). I suppose this is only thirteen years in the future, but the last thirteen years have brought in-home broadband, Facebook, Twitter, Netflix and Youtube, all of which have changed the way we communicate. On this basis, if it was so important that everyone heard The Prophet's message, why did he send it in a private email? Why not on Youtube or the 2025 equivalent?There are also times when Americans make us foreigners laugh. At one point, The 13: Fall comments that the price of oil is rising \u2018astronomically\u2019, and the price of gas (petrol) is expected to soon reach $10 per gallon. Wow. That\u2019s my irony font, in case you couldn\u2019t tell. Petrol already costs $7.00/gallon here in New Zealand, and a quick online search found it\u2019s currently $8.40/gallon in London and Sydney. If petrol only went up by $1.60/gallon in the next thirteen years, I think they\u2019d all be thrilled. (All prices in US dollars. And, yes, I know that petrol is currently only around $4.00/gallon in the US. But only because I looked it up.) Despite the faults, this was an enjoyable book. It was fast-paced, with an interesting plot and a group of characters that I, as a reader, wanted to succeed. The 13: Fall is more overtly Christian than a lot of contemporary Christian fiction, but it is a sound thriller, and it will be interesting to read future books in the series.Thanks to Barbour and NetGalley for providing a free ebook for review.This review also appears on my blog, www.christianreads.blogspot.com."}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9682631-christine", "userReview": "I first read about this book on Goodreads and decided to borrow from the library. This has to be one of the best books I have read this year. The 13: Fall by Robbie Cheuvront & Erick Reed is listed as as Christian fiction but it is much more. From the first page to the last I was entirely riveted by the story that was unfolding before me. Three characters dominate most of the novel Jon Keene a CIA agent, Megan Taylor, FBI hacker extraordinaire and Boz Hamilton, former military chaplain. They are on the hunt for The Prophet, who has been sending messages to the President pleading with about the eminment fall of the United States unless people change their ways and return to the fold. But The Prophet is always one step ahead of them. At first classified as a terrorist, they slowly begin to believe that The Prophet is indeed a messenger from God. Along the way are numerous obstacles are placed in their path, a greedy leader of Homeland Security, a female assassin, attempted assisnation of the President,a nuclear threat by the Chinese and finally invasion by the Chinese, because as they put it, they own much of the United States anyway. The story is delivered at a fast pace and you never lose interest. I refuse to reveal spoilers because others should read for themselves this terrifying and insightful book. This is book one of what appears to be a series. I cannot wait until the next book is delivered. I enjoyed this book so much that I intend to purchase a copy for my own library."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11647802-michael", "userReview": "I received the book for free through Goodreads First Reads. The story takes place during the summer of 2025. The President of the U S is receiving messages from a person who calls himself \"The Prophet\" stating that he has to let the people know that they need to change their ways and return to believing in God instead of believing in material things or there will be a price to pay. The President asks three people to find \"The Prophet\". Boz Hamilton old friend, Megan Taylor an FBI agent who's a computer geek and Jon Keene a CIA agent to hunt down \"The Prophet\". The head of Homeland Security, an assassin and the Chinese are involved in some duplicity which eventually ends with the Chinese attacking the U S on the Fourth of July. The Chinese take control of all the land west of the Appalachian Mountains. The last third of the book is about preventing the Chinese from taking control of the east side of the Appalachians. The book kept me interested in the characters, but be forewarned that the authors are pastors so there are a some references to God and the scriptures. Even though I am not very religious I did not find that this took away from the story. Also be forewarned that this is the first book of at least two (I do not know if there will be more than two) and that \"The 13: Fall\" does not really have an ending.

I enjoyed the fast-paced, FBI-CIA-Whitehouse-connected, time-sensitive adventure to figure out if \"The Prophet\" is real and if what he is preaching should be shared with the rest of the nation. In many ways, the action, the cause-effect relationships, and the characters seemed real. In \"The 13: Fall,\" there's a sense that with President Grant--a man of faith and deep love for his wife and country--at the helm, America might have a chance to avoid her impending doom. Though this book gave me pause about a great many things and how I relate to them, it didn't impact me enough to say, \"Wow, I was blown away by that. It was simply amazing!\" I believe the answer to my slight let-down is in the following hint: skip the Prologue. It was unnecessary, making the next chapters a bit confusing and the actual appearance of the Prologue within the book redundant and anti-climactic. Also, ignore adverbial grammatical problems. If you like mystery and action mixed with spirituality, it will be worth it to you to heed my above-mentioned advice.
