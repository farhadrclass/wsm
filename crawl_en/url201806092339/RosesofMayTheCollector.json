Where to start. I knew I shouldn\u2019t have complained about the dang ending in the previous book. Deep breath. So last year I stumbled upon a novel titled The Butterfly Garden on NetGalley and decided it looked equal parts disturbing and beautiful, and it was both of those things and so much more. I have raved about that book for well over a year now, and if the ending hadn\u2019t thrown in a few unnecessary details in attempting a shocking twist, it would have been my favorite read of the entire year. It was light horror kept wholly in the natural world; I was stunned at how the author wrote of such nightmare inducing content with a fully readable nature. TBG might very well stay in my list of most memorable reads; it was just that good and I highly recommend it to anyone with a strong enough stomach. All this to say, my expectations were extremely high when I found out the story was being extended into a trilogy. Perhaps I misunderstood, but in my opinion this really isn\u2019t a continuation of the original story as much as it is a spin off. We are briefly introduced to a family who\u2019s daughter was murdered years prior as they are close to one of the FBI agents investigating TBG; Roses of May focuses on their back story while also creating a forward narrative of the serial killer who took the life of Priya\u2019s sister Chavi.Once I realized this story wouldn\u2019t focus on the butterflies or their pending case in court, I was still excited to read it. I love crime fiction and I was convinced Hutchison would bring us that same horror we loved from the first collector novel, just with the focus being on a different story. If you are expecting anything remotely close to the feel of the first novel, let me stop you right here. This book was NOTHING like the first one, and that is both good and bad. Unfortunately, this one didn\u2019t work as well for me, as I had picked this up in order to feel things that I experienced previously in the series. If I had known this would be an entirely different book, I likely would have given it at least another half star. I was worried at about 25% in; I was having so much difficulty remembering many of the previous minor characters from the first story and we have a large number of new characters introduced as well. All the names were throwing me for a loop, and on top of that the pacing is VERY slow. \nVERY\u2026 SLOOOOOWWWW\u2026.\n Ok, you get it. Honestly, I would categorize this slow burn more as crime fiction with a sub genre of police procedural. Heavily procedural. We get a lot of detail in every aspect of the plot, which left little room for suspense to carry us through the story with any sense of urgency.However\u2026Once I made it about 50% in I finally was able to connect on some level with the story, and while I never was completely engrossed, I managed to develop a feeling of moderate interest in where it was going, who was behind the murders, and how this would all wrap up. I was satisfied with the ending, but I think what made me bump this from a 2 star to a 3 star read was how impressed I was with the author\u2019s improvement in her quality of writing and language use. While I was goo goo over TBG, it did hold a quality of immaturity in some aspects. The phrases were repetitive, the language very basic, and it held a somewhat young adult aura that I couldn\u2019t quite shake. Not so here; TROM was very much adult writing; the phrases were beautiful and well thought out and I am highly impressed that there was such a jump from one book to the next in that arena.I\u2019m not really sure where the next book will take us, as this one wrapped up pretty much every aspect with a neat little bow, but I also felt the last book had given essential closure, so I guess I\u2019m not a great judge of that sort of thing. I will say that while I\u2019ll probably read the next book so that I can finish out the trilogy, I likely won\u2019t rush to get to it like I have the past two. I did eventually connect with the characters and find pleasure in some of the beautiful writing, but I fear the slow burn and complete genre change between the first and second book in the series didn\u2019t quite work for me. I\u2019m eager to hear other\u2019s thoughts, as I know some readers have thoroughly enjoyed how the author chose to write this new entry. I think if someone were to be made aware of the pacing and changes in this book ahead of time, it might make it a more enjoyable read, so I hope I\u2019ve been able to provide that for someone somewhere. \u2764*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my copy via NetGalley; it was a pleasure to provide my honest thoughts here. \ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf37\ud83e\udd40\ud83c\udf3c\ud83c\udf3b\ud83c\udf3a\ud83c\udf38\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf37BR with Solly Wolly Doodle All The Day; even if it sucks I'm sure we'll come up with some really great catch phrases. \ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39\ud83c\udf39"}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16384209-candace", "userReview": "'Roses of May' is the second book in 'The Collector' series, by Dot Hutchison. Although there are a few connections, through characters, between the two books, they are really not a major factor. This book could easily be read as a standalone.This book is told from multiple POVs, but the majority of the book is told from the POV of Priya Sravasti. Year's ago, Priya's sister, Chavi, was murdered by a serial killer that has managed to evade capture for over a decade. Now it seems that she has become the murderer's latest obsession.Priya and her mother have moved all over the country trying to lay low and avoid Priya's new stalker. With each new springtime murder, Priya receives flowers like the ones left on the victims. It is clear that they are coming from the murderer.Meanwhile, three eager FBI agents work with Priya to try and find the killer before he strikes again. Some have a more personal stake in the manhunt and over the years they've formed a bond with Priya and her mother. Eventually they begin considering ways to use Priya to help them draw out the killer.All in all, it was an okay type of read. I didn't hate it, but I never really felt a strong connection to any of the characters either. It was pretty predictable and lacked the tension and anxiety that I would have expected for a suspense/thriller. It also seemed to have several long lulls, where I was waiting for something...anything...to happen. In my opinion, this follow-up wasn't nearly as good as the first book.Check out more of my reviews at www.bookaddicthaven.com"}, {"userName": "Pouting Always", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48650982-pouting-always", "userReview": "[ Priya killing him  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Mischenko", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1194517-mischenko", "userReview": "See my full review @ https://readrantrockandroll.com/2017/...I read The Butterfly Garden in 2016 and it was truly a captivating thriller. When I saw that the second book was out, I requested it from NetGalley right away. The problem was that I was too late getting to it and ended up having to purchase the book. I didn\u2019t mind because I expected that I would love this one as much as the first.The story follows Priya, a girl who lost her sister Chavi four years ago after she was murdered. Priya and her mother are still very upset about the loss of Chavi and relocate frequently as they are working hard to move on with their lives and to keep low. Chavi\u2019s killer has murdered multiple girls and he\u2019s still out there. Maybe closer than anyone thinks and possibly right under Priya\u2019s nose.Meanwhile, the detectives are still working to help the surviving butterflies (previous book) now that they\u2019re back in the world and trying to adjust to real life again. Many are struggling to adapt and it\u2019s possible that Priya might be able to help them. Eventually, the detectives work together alongside Priya to try to locate Chavi\u2019s killer and lock him up once and for all.I\u2019m not an expert, but If I were to rate this book on the writing alone, I\u2019d give it five stars. The truth is that the story didn\u2019t captivate or thrill me like I expected it to and the pacing is fairly slow for my taste. I think what threw me off the most is that this book is nothing like the first and takes place about four months after the end of The Butterfly Garden with not much focus on the first book at all. I had issues connecting with the characters, but I did enjoy the relationship between them and I did still enjoy the book, especially the ending. I\u2019m looking forward to the final book in the trilogy. I\u2019ll rate this one 3.5 stars.Thanks to NetGalley, the publisher, and the author for allowing me to preview this book for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Mary Beth *Traveling Sister*", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14233569-mary-beth-traveling-sister", "userReview": "For those that loved THE BUTTERFLY GARDEN... This is the second book of The Collector Series. I recommend that you start with book 1 The Butterfly Garden. I loved The Butterfly Garden and this one was really creepy good. I didn't find it to be as disturbing as the first book. I loved this one too. It continues the story of the butterfly girls while introducing us to a new plot. There is a new serial killer who kills a teenage girl and leaves her body in a church surrounded by flowers, every spring for well over a decade. Priya and her mother move every few months to be safe. They seem to be doing good in a small Colorado town but then flowers begin to appear and are afraid that they are in danger.I loved the author's writing style and how the characters were developed. You still have some of the same characters,the FBI Agents, and a couple of the butterfly girls. The main character is Priya who is the sister of one of the serial killer's victims. Even though she tries to be tough, at times she is depressed and angry at what happened to her sister five years ago. Priya's mother is very protective and dominant. This is a very tense read. It is so suspenseful. I loved the action, which didn't seem to stop with lots of twists and turns. Why only four stars and not five? I was able to guess thekiller and it was quite obvious and I love to be kept guessing but that was just minor and didn't matter to me because the creep factor kept me turning the pages. I recommend this book for those that love a dark thriller. Serial Killer Lovers will love these two books. I want to thank Netgalley, the publisher, and Dot Hutchison for a copy of this book in exchange for a honest review."}, {"userName": "Tulay", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36800166-tulay", "userReview": "Don't recommend.This second book isn't as engaging as the first book.

There's no Bureau requirement, no order, no generally agreed guideline, nothing official that mandates his presence at the funeral of a girl who killed herself because the seams where she broke the first time were too fragile to stitch together a second time.\"\nIt's hard enough on the agents when the butterflies start falling apart, but suicides of girls who can't seem to fit back in outside of the Garden are only half of the heartache that Eddison has to face down now. While the girls await their day in court with the Gardener, another killer is at large: the Spring Killer, who kills one teen every spring, and has done so for 17 years without exposing himself. His only marker is the flowers that he leaves around each girl's lifeless body.Eddison may not have a younger sister in blood anymore, but he's got Priya, a spunky London transplant whose older sister Chavi was one of the Spring Killer's victims 5 years prior. Though Priya and her mother have moved across the country to Colorado to escape their past, something is looming on the horizon that has Eddison terrified. These women are the only family he's got left, and he'll be damned to lose them.---4.5 STARSIf you've been following my reviews for a while, you probably already know that The Butterfly Garden, book 1 in The Collector series, was a 5-star read for me; in fact, it was easily one of my top reads of 2016. I was so excited when I got approved for an ARC of this sequel on NetGalley, but this book actually took me a few days to get through (I only note that because the first book was practically a one-sitting read for me). To be totally honest, Dot Hutchison ripped my heart into so many tiny pieces in The Butterfly Garden that I was a little bit terrified to read more of her writing.That said, I am so glad that I read this, because I really enjoyed it so much. It took a little bit of time to get into, as the beginning did feel a little slow, but once Dot got into the meat of the story, I ate it up. While the first book alternated POVs between Inara's memories and Vic Hanoverian's detective work, this one alternated between Priya's first-person experiences and Eddison's third-person investigations and experiences, as well as brief bouts of second-person thoughts from the killer (which was AMAZING). I love the way Dot seamlessly switches perspectives, and she's mastered each formatting so well, which isn't something just any author can do. I also was kind of ecstatic to see the trio of agents back again, especially with the focus having shifted to Eddison; it made me wonder, will the third and final book in the trilogy come from Ramirez's POV? One can only hope, because I'm kind of in love with her character's sass.Speaking of character development, Priya was such an enjoyable narrator; she and her mother are Indian, but have moved to the States from London, so there's some really delightful backstory revealed here and there. Her mother, Deshani, is a firey badass who terrifies everyone she meets (except Priya), and she was just so fun to read about. There's a lovely diverse cast in this book, even more so than in the first one, and there are so many wonderful side characters, especially in the cast of grumpy old veterans that Priya befriends.As far as action goes, it took a while to pick up, but Dot took her time carefully crafting the back story so that, once the action began, I really felt like she just dove in headfirst. Don't get me wrong, this isn't the kind of book with ridiculous new situations and events every other chapter, but she builds up the sense of dread so beautifully that I felt nauseated more than a few times, just out of apprehension for what was going to happen and who the killer would turn out to be. I wasn't shocked by the reveal of the killer, but I honestly don't think we were intended to be taken off-guard; much like in a good horror film, sometimes the best part is learning who the villain is through little crumbs here and there.The story was lightened up here and there with sweet familial bonding, friendly banter between Eddison and Inara (who makes a solid reappearance, much to my delight), and Priya's memories, but all in all, this was a solid thriller/suspense novel that kept me on the edge of my seat more than a few times. I won't say anything further to avoid spoiling it for you guys, but seriously, if you enjoyed the first book, please pick this one up, because it's SO damn good. I would recommend this series to anyone who enjoys thrillers and can handle being kept up at night a little bit, pondering the horrors of mankind.Content warning: this book contains physical and sexual violence, and may be a difficult read for survivors of abuse or anyone with a weak stomach for abuse. Please read at your own risk and keep yourself healthy and happy."}, {"userName": "Jill Croce-McGill", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9119740-jill-croce-mcgill", "userReview": "Wow...

You will see the \u201cButterflies\u201d throughout, but the main focus of this book is on a teenage girl, Priya Sravasti, who lost her sister to a diabolical serial killer that surrounds his victims with different types of flowers. Hanoverian, Eddison, and Ramirez, \u201cThe Quantico 3\u201d, are back again with more developed characters. They have been on the case since Priya\u2019s sister was murdered 5 years ago, since then they have formed a special bond with Priya and her very strong mother, Deshani.

I honestly don't think I even bothered to read the description-I just had to know what happened to the captive Butterflies! I don't think I am the only person who felt this way either.So here is where the disappoint comes into play and my expectations fell apart....While there are some mentions of the Garden and some of the more memorable 'Butterflies', it's clear the author has moved on. Book 2 introduces us to a new victim, a new serial killer, and a police procedural story line that just fell flat for me. The pace was soooooo slow, especially in the middle, that even when there were attempts to tie the Butterflies into the plot, it wasn't enough to move things along.I also had a hard time believing the relationships that these FBI agents had with their victims. How are they able to solve any cases when their time is so wrapped up in checking on them and staying in their lives? It's very sweet, but completely unrealistic.I do wonder how this book would have read on it's own, without having any ties whatsoever to The Butterfly Garden. Would I have enjoyed it more without the disappoint of it not being what I wanted it to be?

It was dark, it was disturbing, it is the kind of book you just don't simply forget about. Though I remembered the plot well and most of the characters, I re-read it before this one. Not only to refresh my memory, but because I just knew I'd genuinely enjoy it again. I'm glad I did, and would really recommend you start with the first book before this one. Though it adds new main characters, several we met in the first feature as well. This one is slower to get started than it's predecessor, and it took me awhile to get into it. The new characters are intensely likeable and the story is interesting. Don't go into it expecting another Butterfly Garden. This one also focuses on a serial killer who forms strange attachments to the young girls he kills and has several strong and inspiring female characters, but that's where the similarities end. While the first book focuses on imprisonment and escape, this one focuses mostly on a young girl named Priya dealing with the tragic death of her older sister. The murderer has never been caught, and the investigation is ongoing. He strikes the same time every year, and that time is approaching... The book also focuses on the \"Butterflies\" we met in the first... the women who escaped the madman that stole them from their lives and kept them practically in a gilded cage for his own pleasure. They've been free for a few months but the media attention still swirls around them and they're all having difficulty adjusting to the outside world. The same agents from the first book are still working on the case of the Butterflies, and now bracing for another victim from the murderer who has left the bodies of girls in churches around the county. They have a special affection for Priya, having met her after she found her sister. They'd protect her at any cost, and now that May is creeping closer, they may have to.

I was really confused at the start of the book because I couldn't figure out who each of the characters were and whether they were in book 1 or not; Google wasn't much help so I just powered on reading in hopes that I would catch on and eventually, I did. I feel like this book would have been a lot better if it was a standalone book and not part of the trilogy. Hutchison could have kept the Quantico Three (the three agents that link book 1 & 2) in as a sort of homage to book 1 but she should have left most of the stuff with the butterflies out of it. I felt like the mix of the new story and the old story was so messy and it came off as being really forced. It was also 100% not necessary. I feel like it didn't add anything to the book and it didn't really add much to the either story. Why force it? The plot of this book is intriguing enough without having to drag the butterflies into it. If Hutchison was set on adding the butterflies then she should have really gone for it. Sprinkling them into the story every so often didn't work for me. Book 1 & 2 are quite different. In book 1, I felt like the agents were used as a very smart way to tell the story of the butterfly garden but in book 2 they are very much apart of Priya's life. The story isn't told the same way and I felt like that was a negative difference from the first book. I also kept questioning why the agents were so invested in Priya's life. I've never spoken to real agents or anything but the ones in the book came off as really unprofessional. I kept thinking over and over again \"would this really happen?\" and that pulled me away from the story and it took away from my reading experience as a whole. This story was a lot more far-fetched then Book 1 and Book 1 was pretty far-fetched! The only difference was that I was totally engrossed in The Butterfly Garden and didn't quite question the authenticity until that silly twist at the end. I thought the serial killer was interesting. I liked his little snippets throughout the book and I thought his motives and backstory was perfectly messed up. It's painfully obvious who the serial killer is, which was unfortunate but I was glad to get a little bit of a twist with his backstory. I thought the strongest aspect of this book was the serial killer as I wasn't really pushed with the main characters. I didn't understand them and I couldn't really relate to them. I especially couldn't understand the relationship dynamics. The characters and their relationships seemed unrealistic and two-dimensional for the most part. The writing was good. I find Hutchison's books very easy to read and this book helped me get out of a slump. Her books are also quite addictive. Even though I mentioned quite a few problems that I had with the book, I didn't want to stop reading it. I wanted to see how it played out and so that is a really good thing. Would I recommend this? Maybe. Will I be reading the next book? Yes!

It's probably possible to read this one as a standalone, but I'm quite sure I would not have enjoyed it half as much without being privy to the background and characters from its predecessor.And boy, did I ever enjoy it! While it's not quite as dark and grisly as the first, perhaps, it's not all that far off; the prologue, written years ago, hints that a serial killer has been born. Fast forward to about four months after an explosion that destroyed the above-mentioned Butterfly Garden, where many beautiful young women were held captive (in more ways than one). A few survived, but all are struggling to readjust to a normal life - if that's even possible given the horrors they experienced. Now, some of the FBI agents from Book I - Victor Hanoverian, Brandon Eddison and Mercedes Ramirez, to be specific - are tackling paperwork. Enter Priya Sravasti, whose sister was murdered several years ago. Someone, it seems, is tracking them wherever they go, leaving flowers at their doorstep. As a result, she and her uber-professional mother move frequently, each time hoping they won't be found. Problem is, the flowers appear to represent the flowers left on the young female victims of an apparent serial killer - a person presumed to have killed 16 girls including Priya's sister.Now they've been found again; and as all this is happening, Priya gets a letter from Inara, one of the surviving Butterfly girls from the garden (the one who seems to have been the \"leader\" of the others). The two girls correspond and eventually meet, thus connecting the cases from the two books. They also connect with Eddison, whose sister Faith was kidnapped at age 8 about 20 years easier. She's never been found, a fact that continues to haunt him - and both he and Hanovarian feel a special, though somewhat strange, affinity with both girls. As the FBI team investigates with the hope of nailing the serial killer, they get with help from Priya, who just may be one of the killer's targets - perhaps even the most important one.As with the first book, there's plenty of tension, even though I correctly guessed who the serial killer was fairly early on. Sections shift perspectives from characters - most notably the killer and Priya - but it's very easy to follow who's who. Especially noteworthy to me is the in-depth development of the main characters; although I'm not sure we'd ever be friends, I really felt I \"knew\" each of them quite well by the end.

What you will get is a book that builds upon The Butterfly Garden but that is its own thing. The first book haunted me, it was a twisted and beautiful thriller and while the sequels keeps the beauty, it loses the constant sense of creepiness that kept you enthralled and made the book hard to put down. Not to say that The Roses of May wasn\u2019t compelling, but I felt like it was longer than it needed to be, the plot took way too long to get going and even when it did, it had too many moments of downtime when not much happened. In hindsight, those moments are easier to forgive because they lead to a beautiful ending that has me excited for the last book in this trilogy.Apart from some small cameos from the butterflies and the return of the same FBI team behind the Butterfly case, this books focuses on a new assemble of characters of which Pryia is the main star. Pryia\u2019s sister was brutally murdered years ago by a serial murder and ever since that she and her mother have been moving to new places every few months hoping for a new beginning that seems impossible while the murderer is still on the run. Pyria\u2019s story mirrors the story of the butterflies in many ways.Ever since her sister got murdered, Pryia has formed a sort of family with the FBI agents involved in that case, the same agents involved with the butterflies. Of the three, the one that gets his own chapters is Eddison. If you liked Eddison before, you\u2019re going to love him here. He is just as grumpy as before but his relationship with Pryia will reveal sides of him that were hinted upon before but never shown. Vic and Ramirez are just as present, but as far as characters go, Eddison is much more interesting in part because of the dynamic he and Pryia have. Pryia\u2019s mother is also a character that stood out for me, she is at times the antithesis of what a mother should be, but not in an abusing way. She\u2019s her own person and quite independent and you can see a lot of her personality in Pryia. Their relationship help alleviate some of the darker parts of the book, insufflating the story with much needed humor. \tTo call The Roses of May disappointing would be unfair, but it does suffer for being the sequel of a book that was almost perfect. It does pick up in the second part and it delivers an amazing ending that had me beg for more. Seeing as this will be a trilogy, I am excited to see more of these characters and where this journey will lead them."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3965659-rachel", "userReview": "Roses of May is more of a companion novel, rather than a sequel, to Hutchinson's The Butterfly Garden. We sort of pick up where we left off, chronologically, but then we follow a different thread. FBI Agent Brandon Eddison features more heavily in this novel, and we see a fair bit of Inara and Bliss, but the meat of the story is about a new character altogether. Priya Svrasti's sister Chavi was murdered by a serial killer five years ago; every May he seeks out a new victim, always a young girl, and murders her in a church and covers her with flowers. As springtime approaches, the FBI agents involved in the case - and Priya - want to make sure this man is found before he kills again.What I found interesting about this novel is that Hutchinson didn't play to what everyone agrees are the strengths that she exhibited in The Butterfly Garden. The power of that book was all in the atmosphere. The contrast between the stunning setting and the horrors that occurred in those pages made it both terrifying and unforgettable... but there's none of that here. This is a rather run of the mill thriller that has none of The Butterfly Garden's magic.That's not to say that it's boring. It isn't. It's a quick and engaging read. I wanted to know what happened, and I was immediately invested in Priya, who's both strong and vulnerable, in a way that's reminiscent of Inara (whom I loved), but not so similar that it feels like Hutchinson is rehashing the same character again.However, there's a lot that I was frustrated with. (1) To me, Priya's relationship with her mother was completely unbelievable, and the extent of what her mother allowed was absolutely ridiculous (you'll know what I'm talking about by the end). (2) I thought the FBI agents facilitating the connection between Priya and Inara was beyond unprofessional, and the interest they took in Priya fell somewhere in the realm of unprofessional and unbelievable - maybe both, I'm not entirely sure. (3) I was able to guess the killer the second he was introduced to the story, and anyone else who's ever read a thriller will be able to do the same.And finally, it's up to you to decide if this is a good thing or a bad thing (I think it's clear where I stand on the matter), but just a general observation: this novel read a lot more like YA than The Butterfly Garden did. Priya is younger than Inara was, so that may have something to do with it, but honestly, there was just a general preachiness to it that I hadn't really been expecting from an adult thriller. Two recurring themes in Roses of May are 'it's okay to not be okay,' and 'you choose your family,' both of which Hutchinson bashes us over the head with, over. and over. and over. and over. I'm not kidding - toward the end, we literally have someone ask Priya if she's okay, and she says something like \"Aren't I always?\" and he replies \"No. And that's okay.\" I lost track of the amount of times I rolled my eyes reading this book. Characters are also constantly making comments about how badass Priya and her mom are, which started to feel rather self-congratulatory by the end. There's also a majorly corny excess of 'this character knows EXACTLY what this other character needs, EXACTLY when they need it'... for such a dark subject matter, this book shows a rather idealized picture of humanity.I mean, Hutchinson is a good writer. She knows how to craft a compelling story. She kept me flipping pages, both here and in The Butterfly Garden. But Roses of May just... wasn't entirely what I wanted. It may have been stronger on its own than as a follow up to The Butterfly Garden, but Hutchinson set the bar high for herself with that one, and I can't help but to feel like Roses of May suffered for it.Trigger warnings for rape (nothing graphic, but it's mentioned fairly frequently), suicide, eating disorders, and emetophobia.I received a copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.

I think the mistake I made was choosing the audiobook route for this one. The story itself is ok, and the narrators are ok, but together I think this is a case where the sum of the parts far exceed the whole.As far as the story goes, I think I unfairly went into this expecting and wanting more Butterfly Garden so it took me a long time to warm up to the new story about Priya. By the end of the story, she'd completely grown on me and now I suspect I'll be irked that she's not a feature in the final book of the trilogy.I think it was a poor decision to have two narrators for this book, especially since there were times when each of the narrators had to do voices for the same characters. It just didn't work for me. Also, this is one of those stupid ones where Audible says the end of the chapter is a completely different place than where the real end of chapter is and that just always pisses me off.I'm glad I'll be read-reading The Summer Children.Badass Female Character score: 5/5 Priya kicked some ass and didn't put up with any bullshit.

I can't even really pinpoint anything super negative to say about this book. What I do know is that when I started The Butterfly Garden, I could not put it down.

I think I have finally settled on 3.5 stars. It wasn\u2019t as good as Butterfly Garden, so it had to be a lesser rating than what I gave that, but I still really enjoyed it.I think the best thing that you could possibly know about Roses of May is the fact that it is not a continuation of Butterfly Garden. I have read many reviews of readers being disappointed that this was not part of the same story. Connected, yes, continuation, no.The series is more of a focus on Vic, Eddison and Ramirez solving serial crimes involving young girls. However, even though Roses of May focuses on a different set of girls and a different killer, Hutchinson does a nice job of keeping you up to date on Maya & Bliss and their lives after the garden. Having said all of that, Roses of May was just not nearly as captivating as Butterfly Garden. As it happens, I read these in quick succession and I wasn\u2019t nearly as engrossed in RoM as I was BG. However, I still enjoyed the story and the slow burn and development of the story. It is tense and suspenseful, as it wraps into a crescendo in the final pages. One of the downsides for me was I was able to figure out who the killer was very early on, so there was no surprise there. Since this is a trilogy, and I will definitely be on the lookout for book 3. If you read Butterfly Garden, then I definitely recommend continuing the series and picking up Roses of May. However, I would not recommend this as a stand-alone book. But I definitely recommend going \"all in\" on the series!"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7510561-stephanie", "userReview": "The Roses of May is the 2nd book in \u201cThe Collector Series\u201d trilogy by Dot Hutchison but it is not a direct sequel to The Butterfly Garden. Instead, it\u2019s a story about a completely different serial killer whose been killing one girl every spring for over a decade and leaving each of them covered in a different flower. It also has a brand new main character, Priya Sravasti, whose sister was one of the killer\u2019s victims 5 years ago.The Roses of May isn\u2019t a story with the same horror, depravity, and terror as The Butterfly Garden so if you plan on reading this book, don\u2019t go into it with the same expectations of it being exactly like that. It\u2019s not, but that\u2019s okay because it's a wonderful book!It is an excellent suspense story although it didn\u2019t quite keep me as enthralled as The Butterfly Garden. Also, I figured out who the serial killer was way too early on, which was a bit disappointing. Yet, The Roses of May is an overall captivating, engaging, and suspenseful mystery that I highly recommend because the book is just really well-written, the characters are wonderful, and the ending is so very perfect that it makes up for any complaints I might have. I think that The Butterfly Garden was just such a fabulous book that it makes The Roses of May hard to be the 2nd in the series. Still, that doesn't make it any less than a captivating book, and it should be read and enjoyed on its own merits. While the story isn\u2019t about the \"butterflies\" from the 1st book in the trilogy, it does have some of the characters from the book, and you get to catch up with how a few of them are handling their lives now they are free. Because I felt very invested in what happened to the girls in The Butterfly Garden, it feels right somehow to be able to check-in on their well-being so to speak.But the main focus of the book is Priya. She\u2019s a remarkable young woman who has been trying to put her life back together since her sister\u2019s murder when she was only 12, but that\u2019s become almost impossible since it seems she's now the serial killer\u2019s latest obsession. Priya\u2019s strong, yet vulnerable, but she has a super strong mom who is amazing (and a little scary).Plus, the \u201cQuantico 3\u201d, Vic, Ramirez, and Eddison from Book 1 are back but even more so. Since they have been working to find this serial killer and were part of the investigation into Priya's sister\u2019s murder, they somehow have become like family to Priya and Deshani, her mom. You get to learn a lot more about the FBI agents in this book, especially Eddison, and he is especially more likable in this book because of the protective, big brother type role he plays towards Priya. I hope we learn more about the \u201cQuantico 3\u201d in the last book in the trilogy!Also, I liked how the author really formed a relationship with Priya and some of the \"butterflies\" from Book 1; it was nice to see them develop a friendship considering the hell all of them went through, and I look forward to seeing how that plays out as well.There is so much to like about this book! Even as horrible as the serial killer is and as disgusting and repulsive as he is, he appears likable and trustworthy when you first encounter him until you are hit with who he is, and go \u201coh wait...wow!\u201d.One thing is for certain, if you enjoy a good suspenseful mystery, excellent writing, and a strong plot, then you\u2019ll undoubtedly enjoy this book! I\u2019m highly anticipating the 3rd in the trilogy!!

I really loved The Butterfly Garden last year and when I saw this, I was super excited to give it a read, but no. I read 100 pages of this book, which is a whole third of the story and nothing grabbed me. Nothing. Did anything even happen in those first 100 pages?Warning, that you\u2019ll see on lots of others reviews\u2026 this isn\u2019t a sequel. This is a totally new book, with a new crime, it just has some of the same characters. This could be the second in a series of Inara & Bliss & Eddison, or whatever, but don\u2019t call it a sequel when that\u2019s not what it is.This felt really YA to me, but I\u2019m not seeing anywhere that anyone else is classing it like that. For me, this read really immaturely and the constant use of random swear words only added to that. It felt as though Hutchison added them in as a way to make the book feel more adult, but for me, it did the opposite of that.Eddisons relationship with Priya??? One, it felt totally inappropriate, even though there was nothing like that going on. They thought and spoke about each other really fondly, but not in a family kind of way, in a different way, and it made me feel icky to read. And two, it was totally unbelievable. As if an FBI agent (and his team) would have time to send cards and texts to a girl from one of their cases\u2026 over years and years. ALSO, why did Priya get special treatment? I\u2019m sure the serial killer went round and killed other girls with sisters, what made Priya so special as to garner all this attention from a grown-ass FBI agent? It was weird and it made me feel uncomfortable the entire way through.Plus, I find it really hard to believe that if a 17 year old went missing for 3 hours and you called the police, they would bring out patrol cars and lots of officers\u2026 that\u2019s not how it works at all. At that age, it\u2019s 24 hours they wait, normally, sometimes shorter if it\u2019s a strange circumstance, but never 3 hours. That\u2019s reserved for young children.Also, the need to make this book as open and accepting as possible got a little bit frustrating. I love that this book had diverse main characters, but there was something about the emphasis on this diversity that just screamed \u201clook, I\u2019m a diverse book!!!!!\u201d Plus, the bit where the mum sits down to play a Lego game on the Xbox made me wince in secondhand embarrassment.Now, I don\u2019t want to sound like a total downer and hater of this book, because I\u2019m not. Hutchison is amazing at writing, her descriptive skills are out of this world and she really knows how to capture feelings with words but for me, the story sucked and I couldn\u2019t get on with it at all.Thanks to Netgalley and Thomas & Mercer for giving me the opportunity to read this book in exchange for an honest review.

I couldn't believe my eyes when I first saw Roses Of May mentioned and realized it was a sequel; I instantly knew I had to read it after my experience with the first book. It was interesting how some of the main characters of The Butterfly Garden reacted after what happened in the first book, but Roses Of May can in fact also be read as a stand-alone since it's mainly about a completely different case and serial killer. Dot Hutchison has without doubt created another creeper with this one and the case is intriguing, although I do have to say I was slightly disappointed by the fact I figured out his identity really early on in the story. The writing style is just as enjoyable as book one and I liked the main character Priya, her kick-ass attitude and relation with the feds. I think I still prefer the first book, just because it made a little more impact for being such a dark, twisted and shocking story, but Roses Of May has its share of horror as well. I liked that the POV switches between the present and the voice of the killer... It really adds to his character. As with the first book, it has a rather closed ending, so no painful cliffhangers (thankfully). I'll be wondering what the third and final book will be about though!WARNING:\u00a0Possible spoilers!

And the agents know that if they don't find him, another young woman will turn up dead in a church with her throat slit and her body surrounded by flowers. Will they be able to stop them on time? And what has Priya, one of the victims' sister, to do with all of this?While not as strong or twisted as the first book, I still very much enjoyed Roses Of May. Especially the final part had a very fast pace and the writing style is very enjoyable to read. The serial killer and plot itself are both intriguing and the chapters with the killer's thoughts added another level of suspense.\u00a0I also might or might not have squealed when I saw my name mentioned in the story (doesn't happen often, trust me!).

I remember closing that book on my Kindle, sitting down, and pacing for a few minutes because I needed to process what I had just read. It's dark and disturbing and just, wow. And I didn't love the ending. But I couldn't help myself and a few days later, I caved and started this one.But oh my goodness: I COULD NOT STOP READING. I'm so puzzled by the mixed reviews! I mean, different strokes for different folks and all, but I thought this was great. I liked it better than the first book.The Roses of May picks up a short time after the Butterfly Garden has been destroyed. The case is still ongoing, however, and the investigators that we met in the first book are the same investigators that are featured in this one: the Quantico Three. Here, they're investigating a string of very unpleasant serial killings in which young girls are found murdered in similar fashion, all in churches, all surrounded by flowers. The Quantico Three are simultaneously juggling this case and the Butterfly Garden case.So! the big question is: are the \"butterflies\" in this book? Yes they are. At least, the ones that are left.This book actually features Priya, the sister of one of the victims of the serial killer. Priya and her mother are very interesting and have spent the last several years grieving and moving around from place to place...for reasons I don't really want to tell you. They're super, super, always on the lookout for someone that could possibly be the killer because Priya has been receiving gifts that fit within the killer's profile. Let that sink in. But because of technicalities at the FBI that include low funds and a boss with a chip on her shoulder, the Quantico Three are limited in what they're allowed to do to protect Priya and her mother from what is really shaping up to be a dangerous situation, but OH HELL NO that won't be stopping these top-notch investigators. Hell-to-the-no.This book felt different to me than the first book because - where the first book focused on the crimes as they were being committed and was really dark - these serial killings have already taken place, so the investigators are trying hard to find the bad guy. There is a big focus on their investigation, on protecting Priya from any harm that could happen to her, and on their increasing suspicion that harm will happen to her. There is also a focus on the aftermath of these crimes, and on the well-being of the victims and their families from both the first book and the crimes from this book. So this is an entirely different focus and feel.Also: I really thought I had this one all figured out. But nope, I was wrong again! I'm generally awful at picking the bad guys in books, but that's okay because it's so much fun being so shocked when I'm wrong. You could have knocked me right out of my chair when the big reveal happened!Some other fun things about this book:1. The link between this book and The Butterfly Garden is obviously the characters. The \"butterflies\" feature heavily in this book as a means of support for both Priya and the investigators. LOVE LOVE LOVE. The investigators are so great.2. The characters that I didn't really love in the first book are surprisingly some of the characters that I absolutely loved in this one. Specifically: Brandon Eddison, the FBI Agent. I thought he was a jerk in the first book because of his methods of investigation, but he has totally different methods in this case, and I feel like I understand him 100% better. He has different strengths than his two partners plus he has a backstory. I'll just leave it at that.3. The \"butterfly\" that I didn't really love from the first book - she's so great in this one. She reads almost like a different person entirely now, but I would imagine that if you're no longer in captivity and you now have a voice -- anyone would be different. 4. I loved the way the book mentions (a few times) that the media has impacted their recovery, their return to normalcy, and their privacy (or lack of it). Also how the media has made their lives more dangerous and brought attention to them in ways that could make them the focus of further crimes against them, bullying, and cyberbullying. This isn't something that we always think about as we are interested in these big news stories, but I appreciate how these characters were able to make this a theme in this book.I loved this one. I think I can officially say now that I'm super, super eager to read the next book but I'm so impatient for the release date! Why does it have to be so long from now? WHY? I hope it features the Quantico Three again. I've grown quite fond of them. I hope we continue to hear from the \"butterflies\" and I hope we hear from Priya and her mother.I think this book ended in a much better way than the first book. I actually think this book was much better than the first book in pretty much every way. I hope the next book is just as good. My heart raced throughout this book and I just couldn't stop reading -- this is exactly the type of suspenseful read that I love."}, {"userName": "Sam (Clues and Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20224869-sam-clues-and-reviews", "userReview": "After reading (and obsessing over) The Butterfly Garden earlier this year, I was elated to find out that this book would be a part of a \u201ccollector\u201d trilogy. The Roses of May, by Dot Hutchison, is the second novel in this trilogy. Not knowing whether or not this one would start where the first novel left off or if it would focus on a new set of \u201ccollections\u201d, I was eager to find out. The novel did have some reoccurrences of original characters from The Butterfly Garden but also has a whole new serial killer and new female lead. The novel opens and dives right into the story. Taking place a few months where the first novel left off but in an unconventional way. The Butterflies are awaiting the trial of the Gardener and a few of the girls, unable to handle the trauma of the garden, have completed suicide. The police officers from the original case are dealing with this and also find themselves being pulled back into a different investigation involving a serial killer who murders girls and adorns them with flowers. When a sister (Priya) of one of the victims\u2019 finds herself a target, the investigators must use their knowledge of the past and what they learned from the garden to find the perpetrator before he collects around victim.My favourite part of The Butterfly Garden was the narrative style and the creepy events that took place in the garden; I found that this one read more like a police procedural. Instead of being character driven, this one focused more on the police investigation and the officer\u2019s relationships to the victims. Initially, I was slightly confused by what was going on and there were moments throughout the plot where I found myself not fully understanding some of the plot\u2019s importance or struggling to understand the relationships between some of the characters. I feel like someone who hasn\u2019t read The Butterfly Garden would feel completely out to lunch. Although it is not a direct sequel, it still relies heavily on the basic knowledge of characters and plot points from the first novel to drive the story. Although I appreciated The Roses of May for what it was, it was completely not what I was expecting. I will absolutely continue to read other books in the series, but I absolutely found this one less addicting than the first."}, {"userName": "Isabela", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27838244-isabela", "userReview": "3 stars I still remember reading The Butterfly Garden - it was sick and twisted and interesting, and I couldn't put it down. It'll always be one of my favorite books, simply because of the impact it had on me. When I heard a sequel was coming up I didn't know if I should feel nervous or excited, and now that I've read it I can say I'm a bit disappointed.Roses of May also gave me the chills, it was beautifully written and the athmosphere is very dark and creepy. I also loved to read more about some characters from the first book, such as Inara, Bliss and Eddison - I still love them so much. Reading about how the girls were moving on with their lives, or, well, trying to move on, was heartbreaking.\n\u201cWhat I have is a healthy sense of spite and a determination that someday I\u2019m going to learn how to do this thing called living. Maybe that\u2019s as far as justice can stretch.\u201d \nHowever, the problem I had with this second book is that it was just not as entertaining as the first one, simple as that. Even though I was creeped out during some chapters, others I was kind of bored and just begging something to actually happen. Even though this is a relatively small book, it took me a while to go through it, which made it not as enjoyable as I was expecting it to be."}], "description": "Four months after the explosion at the Garden, a place where young women known as the Butterflies were kept captive, FBI agents Brandon Eddison, Victor Hanoverian, and Mercedes Ramirez are still entrenched in the aftermath, helping survivors in the process of adjusting to life on the outside.
