I reached out and caught hold of the porcelain, trying not to grab at him, not to touch him. No. No. No. He was raging, spitting, the blows hitting the wall as often as they hit me. Beyond the door, Mama was screaming. Daddy Glen was grunting. I hate him. I hated him. The belt went up and came down. Fire along my thighs. Pain. I would not scream. I would not, would not, would not scream.\u201d\nBone played by Jena Malone in the movie adaptation.There was confusion when Ruth Anne \u201cBone\u201d Boatwright was born. Her Mama, a fifteen year old girl without a husband, was recovering from a car wreck and from giving birth when the people with the paperwork came around. Bone\u2019s Aunts tried to answer the questions, but because they could not remember exactly the name of the fellow who was the sperm donor the paperwork went through as UNKNOWN FATHER and Bone\u2019s birth certificate is stamped in big red letters at the bottom. ILLEGITIMATE. Her mother tries for years to get that red stain removed from the birth certificate, but the people at the courthouse take too much malicious, petty joy out of continuing to issue each new birth certificate with the same damning stamp.The Boatwright clan is a force of nature. The men are hard working, hard hitting, binge drinking, thieving, skirt chasing,and fast driving dervishes of fire and passion who when not fighting each other are fighting the world.They are intensely loyal, to a fault, to their friends and family. The Boatwright women name their daughters after their sisters. They name their sons after their brothers. They demand respect and get it. When Aunt Alma gets into a conflict with her husband she makes if very clear how she sees things. \u201dOh, but that\u2019s why I got to cut his throat,\u201d she said plainly. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t love the son of a bitch, I\u2019d let him live forever.\u201dFamily get togethers are intensely emotional and always on the verge of song or violence. Uncle Earle is Bone\u2019s favorite uncle. He is popular with the whole family brimming with charisma. He is the one guy everybody wants to see when they are troubled. \n\n\nUncle Earle played by Michael Rooker in the movie adaptation.\n\u201dUncle Earle was my favorite of all my uncles. He was known as Black Earle for three counties around. Mama said he was called Black Earle for that black black hair that fell over his eyes in a great soft curl, but Aunt Raylene said it was for his black black heart. He was a good-looking man, soft-spoken and hardworking. He told Mama that all the girls loved him because he looked like Elvis Presley, only skinny and with muscles. In a way he did, but his face was etched with lines and sunburned a deep red-brown. The truth was he had none of the Elvis Presley\u2019s baby-faced innocence; he had a devilish look and a body Aunt Alma swore was made for sex. He was a big man, long and lanky, with wide hands marked with scars. \u2018Earle looks like trouble coming in on greased skids.\u2019\u201d\nNow Bone\u2019s Mama is married to one young man just long enough to get pregnant with Bone\u2019s sister Reese. He died under unusual circumstances clearing the way for Glen Waddell. Glen comes from a good family, a family that owns their houses and goes into professions like lawyering and doctoring. Now Bone\u2019s mother Anney is a beauty, fine boned and graceful, but compared to the type of women that a Waddell is expected to marry she is trash. Glen has never lived up to his father\u2019s expectations and marrying Anney just confirms for their family that he is never going to amount to anything. He gets in fights. He intensely loves Anney; and yet ,can\u2019t hardly stand to be in the same room with Ruth Anne without finding some \u201cbone of contention\u201d. \n\u201dI looked at his hands. No he never meant to hurt me, not really, I told myself, but more and more those hands seemed to move before he could think. His hands were big, impersonal, and fast. I could not avoid them. Reese and I made jokes about them when he wasn\u2019t around--gorilla hands, monkey paws, paddlefish, beaver tails. My dreams were full of long fingers, hands that reached around doorframes and crept over the edge of the mattress, fear in me like a river, like the ice-dark blue of his eyes.\u201d\nDaddy Glen, as he insists on being called, swears he loves Bone, but when he is not beating her he is pulling her against him; rubbing her up and down his body; his hands inside her clothes. His mind is twisted with hate and unnatural desire a lethal combination that kills love. Even though she can\u2019t carry a tune, Bone wants to be a gospel singer. She loves the music, but what she really loves about religion is Revelations. It stokes the rage in her heart and gives her hope that everyone will get what\u2019s coming to them. \n\u201dI sang along with the music and prayed for all I was worth. Jesus\u2019 blood and country music, there had to be something else, something more to hope for. I bit my lip and went back to reading the Book of Revelation, taking comfort in the hope of the apocalypse, God\u2019s retribution on the wicked. I liked Revelations, loved the Whore of Babylon and the promised rivers of blood and fire. It struck me like gospel music, it promised vindication.\u201dBone loves her Mama so completely that she made me want to love her too. I just couldn\u2019t forgive her. Sometimes when we are faced with something so horrible our brain chooses not to process that information. Anney knew, but didn\u2019t want to know. Anney not only let Bone down, she let us all down. I know we can\u2019t help who we fall in love with, but you have to love your children more. In the beginning, children are the best of us ,and how we protect them and nurture them will determine whether they continue to represent us to the world as better versions of ourselves or shattered adaptations of the worst of us. \nDorothy AllisonThe plot is predictable, no deviations from a script that has been played before. Despite that I bumped it to four stars for the lovely descriptions of the Boatwright family. I felt that Allison has that Southern gift for language that soars especially well when she is describing people. The Boatwright\u2019s are a family I\u2019d be proud to be a part of and a family I\u2019d work like crazy to get far, far away from."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "Bastard Out of Carolina: A Reader's Personal Reflection\n\u201cPeople pay for that they do, and still more, for what they have allowed themselves to become. And the pay for it simply: by the lives they lead. - James Baldwin\u201d --From the epigraph to the novel.\n\n\n\"No one knows what goes on behind closed doors.\"\nIt is hard to swallow, hard to believe, stories such as the one told by Dorothy Allison. The world would be a much prettier and more pleasant place if we did not have to believe things of the nature related by young Ruth Anne Boatwright, known to her family as Bone.But this I know is true. These things have always happened. They have happened from time immemorial. I do not believe that it was the idea of Lot's daughters to lie with their father in his drunkenness. Rather, when a man's wife is a pillar of salt, he has needs which must be met elsewhere.In the basement of the Monroeville, Alabama, County Courthouse, the old Courthouse, are the records dating back to its construction. I visited there. I asked permission to examine the records. At the turn of the Twentieth Century, I found cases of incest and carnal knowledge of a child under the age of twelve in the huge red leather bound docket books, the parties long dead.I was an Assistant District Attorney for twenty-eight years. In the mid-1980s, with the breaking news of child abuse cases occurring across the United States, I was assigned to handle those cases. Actually, I volunteered for it. I had no idea of the world I was about to enter.The Judicial system was ill equipped to answer the problem of child abuse cases. Juries were uncomfortable with the facts that poured out like a stream of sewage. It was a world of children with knowledge for which they should have no basis. Abusers who should have been protectors. Mothers who should have been the first to protect their child from the man in their lives. But the abusers were abusers and the mothers were not supportive of their children.I was the Courthouse Santa Claus. I had the ability to talk with children. I was willing to work with social workers who were more like police officers and police officers who could have been mistaken for social workers. It was the beginning of a multi-disciplinary approach to handling child abuse cases. We learned as we went. Child by child.Through the years, I became known as Mr. Mike to the children whose cases I took to court. The name stuck with social workers and police officers. I developed a reputation of winning those cases. And I was called the meanest man who ever stepped into a courtroom when I was able to carve a Daddy Glenn into little pieces on cross-examination. The television cameras were often there for the verdict. The crime beat reporter was there. I was asked how I handled the cases without them getting to me. Naturally, I lied. My response was they did not. If I allowed the cases to get to me, I would not be an effective advocate for any child. I imagine my lies were fairly transparent, as I sometimes bared my emotions uncontrollably in summation. I could only say there are some things that should make a grown man cry.The truth is, keeping the lid on your emotions takes a tremendous toll. These were the cases you did take home with you at night. These are the children whose faces I can still see, whose voices I can still hear to this day. And there are the eyes of the dead, the glazed eyes in little bodies on steel gurneys in emergency rooms, on whose faces I still imagine I see, sometimes surprise, sometimes resignation.Often I wondered how those children who lived might have grown up. What they would have said. What lives they would have lead. I read Bastard Out of Carolina when it was first published in 1992. Dorothy Allison became the voice I had been looking for. It helped me understand better the Bones of this world, the Anneys, and the Daddy Glenns. In a way this book became an unholy bible for me in the preparation of cases.Understand, I did not set out to write about myself, although it may appear otherwise. I wrote this as I did to encourage anyone who has not read this book to do so. I wrote this for anyone who has read it, as a speaker for children, that what you have read in the pages of Dorothy Allison's book is true.I write this in appreciation for the courage required and the emotional toll taken by Dorothy Allison to tell this story.Finally, this is for all the Ruth Ann Boatwrights in the world. There are so many of you. I know that you are not trash. I know that you are not all poor. I know some of you make yourselves unattractive in the hope you will be left alone. I know some of you will run away from home. I know that some of you will excell in school and some of you will not. But most important, whatever has happened to you, it was not your fault. And I write this in the hope that one day you will believe this even if you do not today. Know this is true. There is always someone there to listen.And for all the Daddy Glenns out there? It's not the 1950s anymore. Somebody's gonna get you, sooner or later.For those who are looking for a more traditional review, I heartily recommend those of Jeff Keeten at http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... and Larry Bassett found at http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/... ."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "This book is beautifully written, but I did not enjoy it. It is a grim story of poverty, child abuse and rape. The prose may be lovely but the drama is harrowing.\"Things come apart so easily when they have been held together with lies.\"Bastard Out of Carolina is the story of Ruth Anne Boatwright, but everyone calls her Bone. She was born out of wedlock and doesn't know who her daddy is. Her mama tried several times to get the word \"illegitimate\" removed from Bone's birth certificate, but the courthouse clerk just smirked at her.\"Mama hated to be called trash, hated the memory of every day she'd ever spent bent over other people's peanuts and strawberry plants while they stood tall and looked at her like she was a rock on the ground. The stamp on that birth certificate burned her like the stamp she knew they'd tried to put on her. No good, lazy, shiftless. She'd work her hands to claws, her back to a shovel shape, her mouth to a bent and awkward smile \u2014 anything to deny what Greenville County wanted to name her.\"Her mama eventually married a man named Glen, and that is when Bone's real troubles began. Glen couldn't keep a job or pay the bills, so the family often went hungry and had to move a lot. Glen also had a fierce temper and started molesting and beating Bone, and she didn't know what to do. Her mama seemed to know Glen disliked Bone, but she said she loved him so much that she wouldn't leave him. After several years of abuse, Bone's aunt saw the bruises on her, and she was finally taken away.Poor Bone. She blamed herself for making Glen angry, and she hated that her mama couldn't protect her. At times she would get so mad that she wanted to fight him, and other times she just wanted to disappear. Those passages were some of the most heartbreaking in the book.\"I was no Cherokee. I was no warrior. I was nobody special. I was just a girl, scared and angry. When I saw myself in Daddy Glen's eyes, I wanted to die. No, I wanted to be already dead, cold and gone. Everything felt hopeless. He looked at me and I was ashamed of myself. It was like sliding down an endless hole, seeing myself at the bottom, dirty, ragged, poor, stupid. But at the bottom, at the darkest point, my anger would come and I would know that he had no idea who I was, that he never saw me as the girl who worked hard for Aunt Raylene, who got good grades no matter how often I changed schools, who ran errands for Mama and took good care of Reese. I was not dirty, not stupid, and if I was poor, whose fault was that?\"I had previously read Dorothy Allison's memoir Two or Three Things I Know For Sure, so I knew that this novel was semi-autobiographical. From the author's afterword:\"Writing Bastard, I had imagined that girl \u2014 or rather some girl of thirteen or so who hated herself and her life. I had imagined that, reading Bone's story, a girl like her would see what I intended \u2014 that being made the object of someone else's contempt and rage did not make you contemptible. I was arguing against the voice that had told me I was a monster \u2014 at five, nine, and fifteen. I was arguing for the innocence and worth of that child \u2014 I who had never believed in my own innocence.\" \"The mythology of rape and child abuse had done me so much damage. People from families like mine \u2014 southern working poor with high rates of illegitimacy and all too many relatives who have spent time in jail \u2014 we are the people who are seen as the class who does not care for their children, for whom rape and abuse and violence are the norm. That such assumptions are false, that the rich are just as likely to abuse their children as the poor, and that southerners do not have a monopoly on either violence or illegitimacy are realities that are difficult to get people to recognize. The myths are so strong they subvert sociological data and personal accounts.\"Truthfully, the afterword was my favorite part of the book. Besides sharing her motivations for writing the novel, Allison also discussed how some schools around the country have censored and banned the book, and how she grieved whenever she heard such news. If you want to read Bastard Out of Carolina, try and find a copy that has the afterword (mine was the 20th anniversary edition). That said, I don't know if I can recommend this novel because it was so grim. I am glad that some readers have found comfort in seeing issues of abuse brought to light, but it will be awhile before I can shake those awful images. \"I do not want to be the person who acts always out of fear or denial or old shame and older assumptions. I want to be my best self \u2014 the one who set out to tell a story that might make a difference in the lives of people who read it. Unafraid, stubborn, resilient, and capable of enormous compassion \u2014 someone like Bone.\""}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "Dorothy Allison pissed a few people off when she first wrote this novel. Boy am I glad she did. Why should literature seek to please, rather than excite the reader? Why should it try to be polite in order to seek the truth? Should books not produce composed disorder, honest diatribes, and gut-wrenching truths? Insult me, make me angry, make me laugh, make me cry, leave my mouth agape from disbelief at your crude renunciations of what I thought was orthodox--all things that good books do. In Greenville County, South Carolina, lives the Boatwright family, a family that bad things seem to happen to all the time. At the center is the child narrator, Ruth Anne, who is called Bone throughout the book. The scene opens with Bone's mama, a teenage girl, heading to the county office to try and get the word \"bastard\" erased from her daughter's certificate. Later, she tries to look for someone to marry in order to avoid such things in the future. With these few scenes, the mood of the book is set. Poor, uneducated, working class folks, the Boatwrights. It is a family saga with violence, teenage pregnancy, unemployment, and instability at its core. The women must find husbands and have babies, the men are drunks who constantly switch jobs, etc. \"A man has needs,\" they laughed each time they got together. \"So what you suppose a woman has?\" \"Men!\" one of them would always answer in a giggling roar. Then they would all laugh til the tears started running down. I wasn't at all sure what was so funny, but I laughed anyway. I liked being one of the women with my aunts, liked feeling a part of something nasty and strong and separate from my big, rough boy cousins and the whole world of spitting, growling, over bearing males.I find that I \"read\" audiobooks slower. So for weeks, I listened to this in spurts, my iphone plugged to my ear at night, and I tell you, there were times when during vicious scenes, my body shook with her pain. The prose here is so vivid, the imagery so profound, that I felt as if I was right in the moment and I didn't like it. Didn't like what it must have felt to be Bone. Thought Daddy Glenn was a pig, and at the end I really disliked Bone's mama. Yet I couldn't help but like the Boatwright men--Earl especially. Loved Ruth. Didn't care for Shannon Pearl and her family but liked the way in which Allison used them to show hypocrisy in the the community and in the church. There is no way I could have known what it felt like to be the Boatwrights, but Allison gave me some inkling. And this is why I loved the book--notwithstanding the fact that Elizabeth Evans was a wonderful reader, of course. The imagery, character development, intense dialogue, and bright scenes, made this book as real as an ordinary day for some. In the beginning, the prose is so lyrical, though not as much in the second half--which makes you feel as if Allison was reeling you in with beauty so she could introduce horror. In her afterword, Allison wrote that she chose fiction and not nonfiction because she wanted a \"well-told lie\" and because she didn't want her mom vilified. Though she did experience some of what Bone experienced, the author said, Bone was a completely different character from her because she wanted a character with fortitude (my word though, not hers). Bone tells her harrowing, heart-wrenching story with a mixture of ease and spunk. I really liked her as a character: her moments of vulnerability and introspection, her spunk, her fearlessness in the times of fearfulness."}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "This is one of those books that leaves you with so many questions, but I think the afterword really helped me understand the overall message, and it made me realize how important this book is. This is a brutal and honest story about Ruth who grows up with her mother, her sister and her step-father in America. She is also surrounded by a ton of aunts and uncles who help her guide her through life. This book is not for the faint-hearted, but still I think it's very important that everybody read it. It's one of the most honest books I've ever read, and while especially one aspect of it seemed unrealistic to me, I couldn't help but embrace the book and cry over Ruth's fate. I cannot recommend this novel enough; however, I don't recommend it if you're still young since it is quite brutal. After all, there is a reason why this book was banned (even though I'm personally very much against that ban!).

Written by Dororthy Allison and set in Allison's home town of Greenville, South Carolina in the 1950s. The story centres around \"Bone\" Boatwright a girl born fatherless to 15 years old Anney Boatwright and sexually and physically abused by her step-father Glen but part of a large extended family who know poverty and life is as hard as it gets a life where family matters but drinking and fighting is part of their existence.I personally found this a long drawn out harrowing story of abuse and relentless violence and while the story needed to be told I found the telling was just way too drawn out and repetitive. There was so many pointless sections in the Novel that I found myself zoning out on a couple of occasions. While the story is important and a shocking and excellent insight into a child's life of abuse I couldn't find the emotion within the story and although I was shocked and I just didn't connect with this book like many readers have done and for me this could have been an excellent short story but just didn't make fulfill me as a novel and this might have been the fact that the book is quite graphic and a lots of detail. I also found the relentless cast of characters quite frustrating. I know that is a book loved by many but just and ok read for me. I listened to this one on Audible and the narration was was adequate but I think I may have got more out of reading a hard copy of this book.Perhaps readers who liked The Glass Castle or Angela's Ashes might be interested in this novel."}, {"userName": "Beverly", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68708752-beverly", "userReview": "This is such an important vital book for survivors of child sexual abuse and assault, that I was disheartened to learn from Dorothy Allison's postscript that her book has been censored in school systems from Maine to California.

Raylene knows this from her personal experience of having a lesbian partner choose her baby over Raylene. This is divulged at the conclusion of the book. Nothing should be a surprise since Raylene is, above all, a Boatwright. If Bone is Dorothy Allison, the psychiatric bills must be immense.

The novel opens with the birth of main character and narrator of the story, Ruth Anne (nicknamed Bone), the illegitimate daughter of a 15-year-old member of the dirt poor Boatwright clan. The book, a semi-autobiography, chronicles Bone\u2019s youth growing up as \u201cpoor, white trash\u201d and the abuse she suffers at the hands of her emotionally disturbed stepfather.The abuse scenes are wrenching and disturbing and while they play an important part in both the plot and the development of Bone\u2019s character, the conflict with her stepfather is often kept in the background throughout much of the novel. The novel is almost a picaresque story and spends a great deal of time giving a detailed look into what growing up poor in the rural south was like and the shame Bone feels of being looked down upon for being \u201ctrash\u201d:\u201cHow am I supposed to know anything at all? I\u2019m just another ignorant Boatwright, you know. Another piece of trash barely knows enough to wipe her ass or spit away from the wind. Just like you and Mama and Alma and everybody\u201dAllison does a good job with this aspect of the story and it\u2019s small wonder since this was the life that she actually lived. She was born into a poor, white trash family and was the illegitimate daughter of a 15-year-old waitress. You feel the raw truth in what Bone says in the novel knowing it\u2019s also the voice of the author who lived it all herself. Bone and her family were often unable to pay their bills and moved from one ramshackle house to another after being evicted for not paying rent. This passage succinctly sums up the effect of such an unstable, rootless life on Bone:\u201cMoving had no season, was all seasons, crossed time like a train with no schedule. We moved so often our mail never caught up with us, moved sometimes before we'd even gotten properly unpacked or I'd learned the names of all the teachers at my new school. Moving gave me a sense of time passing and everything sliding, as if nothing could be held on to anyway. It made me feel ghostly, unreal and unimportant, like a box that goes missing and then turns up but then you realize you never needed anything in it anyway.\u201dAllison does a particularly good job with the dialect and idiom of her rural characters. Her dialogue rings true and the large extended family in her book are all well characterized and feel like real people. I\u2019m particularly impressed with the character of the stepfather. It would be easy to portray him as a monster, but even though he does monstrous things, Allison writes him as a flawed and deeply troubled man and gives some context or reason for his actions. It isn\u2019t a justification in any way, shape, or form, but an attempt to keep him from being just a caricature. His actions are still evil and Bone\u2019s confusion and anguish over them are heartbreaking:\u201cLove would make me beautiful; a father\u2019s love would purify my heart, turn my bitter soul sweet, and lighten my Cherokee wyes. If he loved me, if he only loved me. Why didn\u2019t he love me? I drummed my fists on the porcelain walls of the tub, shook my head and howled underwater, came up to breathe and went under to whine again. If anyone came in, they wouldn\u2019t have known I was crying, and I was sure even God couldn\u2019t hear me curse\u201dThis isn\u2019t an easy read. It\u2019s grim, disturbing, and often sad. Bone\u2019s burgeoning sexuality is twisted by the abuse she suffers and Allison writes several graphic and uncomfortable scenes concerning it. However, there are some bright spots in the novel. The Boatwrights might be \u201cpoor, white trash\u201d, but they are loving and supportive of each other. Allison does a good job of showing a large extended family and how they rely on and help each other."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68450-robert", "userReview": "Bastard Out of Carolina is one of those books about which all of the hooplah surrounding it really baffles me. Allison basically plagiarizes herself by, instead of expanding what was a quite good short story she wrote and published in High Risk: An Anthology of Forbidden Writings, simply cutting and pasting sections of it throughout the book (I actually went through it and identified the sections because I could scarcely believe a serious author would do something so incredibly lazy). The final product was somehow a finalist for the National Book Award, and I think that had much more to do with the content than with the artistic merit. The book was published during a time when \u201cempowerment novels,\u201d written in a style similar to confessional memoirs, dealing with the taboo subjects of gay identify and childhood sexual abuse were enjoying a minor vogue, and I am convinced that a book written at the same level of artistry, but about different topics would have garnered little respect or notice. It is unfortunate, as the novel starts extremely strongly, with the story of Bone\u2019s mother, Bone\u2019s birth, and her early life tight, elicitous, and strong, but then, as Allison just starts plunking in sections of her previously published short story, writing around stock, clich\u00e9d characters (the strong, independent\u2014gasp!\u2014lesbian aunt figure) which you can see coming from a mile away, and relying on moralized speechifying about tolerance, accepting oneself, etc, it simply unravels, and the reader finds that it has no center.

I don\u2019t know who Dorothy Allison is, but she reads like some sheltered spinster with a five point plan and flowery cursive labouring over moleskin writing paper with one hand and wrestling with the Lapsong Souchong and crumpets with the other. And unfortunately its not coming out like it did in Coleman Dowell\u2019s \u2018Too much Flesh and Jabez\u2019. Well, of course that wasn\u2019t a real spinster reeling off the sickmare scenarios there...The grittiest, rawest Southern white trash ever rears its ugly head in Crews\u2019 \u2018Feast of Snakes\u2019 and nothing else I\u2019ve come across ever captures the brilliant clarity and insidious force with which Crews imbues the quintessence of the southern differential. Snippets rear up in short burst perhaps in Agee\u2019s \u2018Death in the family\u2019, Ron Rash\u2019s \u2018Serena\u2019 or Stewart O\u2019Nan\u2019s \u2018\u2019Prayer for the Dying\u2019, and I wouldn\u2019t know about Faulkner because he was impenetrable in \u2018The sound and the Fury\u2019 and so scared me off for more.But Allison: this woman points, shoots and misses the mark every single time. She tries for White Trash, but her Boatwrights are a close knit, caring extended family, where child rearing and money is shared, brothers stand up for their sisters and beat up errant brothers in law for good measure, no one seems to be cussing and frankly the worst of the lot is narrator Bone\u2019s eight year old sister who seems to be masturbating 24/7 (as you do, at that age, right?) for no discernible reason (she was never the focus of incest or abuse).Daddy Glen is supposed to be \u2018cold as death, mean as a snake and twice as twisty\u2019: but rape scene apart, and I\u2019m not excusing that, prithee (and again I go), this is a man who doesn\u2019t drink, doesn\u2019t beat his wife or raise his voice to her, keeps her and her two \u2018bastard\u2019 children even though she can\u2019t have any children by him, and although bestowed with a remarkable propensity to get laid off work, seems to jump right back in the fray getting one job after another, thus perpetually employed. Does this sound like a twisty snake? What did I tell you about Allison trying to patch together a mean ole nasty but just don\u2019t know how to do it? Does throwing in a rape scene willy nilly as an afterthought satisfy the criteria for successful character development?And Bone\u2019s mama? Phish. Here is a woman who tries her best to protect her children all the way throughout until the very last moment, when for no rhyme and reason, and mind you after walking in on Daddy Glen in flagrante delicto with Bone, decides to abandon her two daughters and run off with this fine specimen of a man into the sunset. And its not that final act of unbelievable gauche which rankles me, but rather the lack of any characterisation or build up whatsoever to lead to such a denouement.A total, utter train wreck from start to finish. And I only finished because I couldn\u2019t be bothered to rouse myself from my reclining position on the couch with the duvet thrown over and the Southern Comfort easy in."}, {"userName": "A.M.

When I was still at home, still under his roof. I saw the film adaptation of Bastard Out Of Carolina. We all did; my mother, him, the boys we watched it together in the living room. I laid on the floor in front of the TV and felt all the muscles in my body tense and a hot flush go through me as I watched the story of Bone , the bastard girl. Her mama married a man\u2014after a hard life, he was her second chance\u2014and then her mama stood by as that man hurt Bone. He terrorized her and told her she was nothing, hurt her over and over. That is me, that is me, that is me. I thought as I laid there, my tormentor, my step-father made derisive comments to the movie\u2014I fantasized for the thousandth time standing up with power; 6 feet tall, armed, blazing. I imagined stabbing him in the heart, ripping him to shreds, tearing him into tiny pieces. I laid there and tried to block out his voice, tried to build an invisible wall between us. When Bone\u2019s uncles find out how she\u2019s been hurt they beat her step-daddy to a pulp\u2014they but him in the hospital. I feel flushed and triumphant. I feel that justice like no other justice has ever been served.I was out of the house just a couple years, safe from him but filled with rage\u2014not safe from myself\u2014when I read the book by Dorothy Allison. This time, when the uncles beat Daddy-Glen I just felt sick jealousy. I have four uncles and they pretended that nothing was wrong. It was the book, page 300, near the end after Bone has been beaten and raped and her mama has left her to be with Daddy-Glen that I read the words that have been the only explanation that could ever come close. \u201cBone, no woman can stand to choose between her child and her husband.\u201d That was it, that was all I had besides when my own mama said \u201cDo you want me to die alone\u201d after she had finally been forced to face the facts, after I had run away, attempted suicide, been hospitalized, after I had been terrorized by my own step-father for six years, after I had begged and cried and raged to be saved.I met Dorothy Allison many years later, I waited in line while she signed books and flirted with people. My guts were all jumbled up, I was in line with a friend and I could hardly hold a conversation with her\u2014my eyes were just on Dorothy. I needed so badly to somehow let her know that that line on page 300 of B.O.O.C. was all I\u2019d had for years as any sort of reason why I\u2019d been left out to be hurt, why my mama hadn\u2019t done anything. I got close, I held out my book with shaky hands, I fumbled my words\u2014told her how much her work meant to me, how it had changed my life. The words felt weak and pale and I wished I\u2019d had the money to be taught by her, that I hadn\u2019t just snuck in to see her read. What I really wanted was to sit with her awhile and find out if she\u2019s ever made peace with her mama. If she\u2019d ever lost that sour stinging feeling in her gut when she thought about what had happened."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1415971-jim", "userReview": "Took the shine off my teeth, this one.

I was boiling inside. I was cooking away. I was who I was going to be, and she was a terrible person.'A word of warning right from the start if you are sensitive to physical, sexual and mental abuse than this book may be one you will wan't to avoid. Narrated by Ruth Anne 'Bone' Boatwright, this a harrowing story of a dysfunctional but loving Southern American family that will find itself torn apart when Ruth's Mother falls for a monster of a man called Glen Waddell. Bone who does not know her real father, has a really big family with the women who tell the most amazing stories while the men although having there faults such as being heavy drinkers are lovable rogues who just adore Bone. In a way the story far from a coming of age story is a tribute to her large cracker family.Bone's mother means the world to her and she wan't to do everything to make her happy so when a new man comes into the family home things seem good with Glen being a loving person who want's to be a husband and a father. But after the marriage things will change as his abusive side shows through in scenes that are truly heart wrenching and will have a terrible effect on Bone as her happy childhood is replaced by fear and anger. Slowly Glen will drive the family apart as they move away from the ones they love and despite the family suspicions of Glen, Bone will not tell the truth as negativity overcomes her. The even-handed description of the dynamics that permit the outrages to be denied, and so continued, is what puts the novel into a class of its own.I will be honest and say i have never read a book were i was so much in dread of turning the page thanks to the sheer honesty of the prose that pulls no punches in describing what it can be like for a family in crisis. I felt at times helpless and wanted to put myself between Bone and Glen to protect her. I also hated the mother with a passion, especially at the end when she will show her true colours. Despite the grimness of it all i was left with great hope for Bone thanks to the wonderful narration as confusion moves to clarity. This is undoubtedly an important book that would be a great comfort not only for people who are going through similar experiences but is true eye opener for anyone who reads it. This is a book that just needs to be read, it is that simple and is easily one of the best books i have read this year."}, {"userName": "Sue Davis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2124304-sue-davis", "userReview": "This is one of the most heart wrenching, shockingly sad novels about poverty, family interaction, dysfunction and abuse that I have read recently. For me Allison's treatment of class and gender and, to a lesser extent, race (always there in a southern novel) makes Bastard Out of Carolina such an important contribution to southern literature rather than just a very sad story about an incredibly feckless mother. A quotation that captures the theme of class and race in the context of southern history that dominates the novel: Reading Gone with the Wind with photos from the film, Bone \"looked up from Vivian Leigh's pink cheeks to see Mama coming in from work with her hair darkened from sweat and her uniform stained. A sharp flash went through me. Emma Slattery, I thought. That's who I'd be, that's who we were. Not Scarlett O'Hara with her baking-powder cheeks. I was part of the trash down in the mud-stained cabins, fighting with the darkies and stealing ungratefully from our betters. Stupid, coarse, born to shame and death. I shook with fear and indignation.\" Bastard Out of Carolina provides a powerful examination of the lives of the members of a family, the Boatwrights, people commonly categorized and derided as white trash--impoverished violent drunks who constantly lose their jobs, their rented homes, abuse or leave their wives/girlfriends. For their part, the women get old while still in their 20's from too much poverty, too many children, and so much underpaid or unpaid work trying to take care of their men and keeping their families together. For me, the overarching theme of the novel is the gender dynamic in which the women struggle to survive while the men drink, steal, and fight. I was struck by the way both men and women of all ages seemed to accept those roles--boys stealing, girls quitting school and having babies while still practically babies themselves. Bone's overwhelming anger can be viewed not simply as her reaction to the unbearable abuse on the part of Daddy Glen and her mother's stupidity, but more broadly as her response to finding herself in so many situations that she couldn't understand--physical and sexual abuse, of course, but also, her own sexuality, her aunt's death, her other aunt's breakdown, her uncles' conflicts with the law, and still another aunt's sexual orientation. That burning anger seems to represent Bone's rebellion against her family/class tradition."}, {"userName": "jo", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/210397-jo", "userReview": "i have no idea why this book gets so much love. the writing is mediocre, the story construction weak-linked, the point fudged by so much nonsense, it's blurry and romanticized and wrapped in cheap tin foil and smelling of county fair cotton candy. and the mistique of class: i like it just as much as i like the mistique of ethnicity, i.e. not at all."}, {"userName": "Demisty Bellinger", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/225643-demisty-bellinger", "userReview": "Let\u2019s see. It, at first, seemed like a log of a child\u2019s life, growing up in 1950s (60s? hard to tell; try to figure it out via the music) South Carolina. All the trials and tribulations of growing up in a single family household, crazy extended family, young mother, et cetera. Her mother marries then is widowed (I think this is all before the mother is 21), marries again to a man that beats and molests Ruth Anne, nicknamed Bone -- narr and our hero -- repeatedly. The molestation is silent almost throughout, but the beatings are found out relatively early by the Bone's mother when Bone has to go to the hospital. Her mother knows, but won\u2019t let on to her roughneck bros and sisters. They find out, though, and beat the hell out of Glen (the step daddy) for beating her.A few things I liked: The candid look at childhood sexuality, masturbation, and rape fantasies. I liked how they were only described and not explored. In that way, it stayed in Bone\u2019s voice of growing child and not a doddering adult therapy session. That is to say that the style of the book isn\u2019t written childishly, it is only to say that Bone only allows herself to reminisce with limited knowledge. It is true w/masturbation and fantasies as well as with the abuse she receives from her stepfather: we know it wasn\u2019t her fault that she was beaten and molested, the person who is narrating the book \u2013 supposedly an adult Bone (I may be stretching that) \u2013 knows that it wasn\u2019t her fault, but the 8-12 yr old Bone doesn\u2019t know that! Nicely done.The vignette style was nice. The immediate family situation was the overarching story, but I loved the little stories that only sometimes clearly added to the rest of the novel. It did mimic growing up: the little episodic adventures only a child can find important and the epic size of events and people in one\u2019s life. There were a lot of red herrings, but I sometimes liked that they were never realized.Although there were five hundred characters, I liked the characters. I thought they seemed well-developed, enough so that for the most part, I recognized the names when they repeated after chapters-long hiatuses. Some, of course, were more developed than others, but even the brief characters, like the doctor that first discovered Bone\u2019s bruises, stuck out.I liked that I didn\u2019t know all of the cultural references, but enough so that I knew about what time period the novel took place. I also did not think that there were too many that the novel depended on them, but I sometimes got tired of the lists of gospel and country singers.Some of the language (some I could not stand) was pure beauty, in all of the rawness and dialect salted with an educated, well-read (and assumingly) Bone\u2019s narrative voice. Some of the language was over the top, but there were a lot of niceties.I really liked the freedom to be ugly, evil, and mean. That was done well and, often times, done unapologetically.Some things I didn\u2019t like:The constant use of the word nigger. I grow very suspect whenever someone uses it so freely behind the guise of art. It [the suspecting feeling] may be unfounded, only there because I\u2019m black, but so what? And I took the whole constant reference to the undesirableness of the niggers dotting the novel here and there and the undesirableness of the Boatwright family, some of their dark hair, and especially Bone\u2019s dark hair, dark ways, brownish skin (bark of a walnut tree it was described as at one point) and that her father has, in a manner of speaking, r-u-n-o-f-t, if not fully black but wholly unliked by Granny, may have had an undesirable amount of nigger in him. Also, Bone seemed to have an affinity to every black soul she came across, however briefly and silently. That was one of the red herrings.Some of the dialect seemed over-the-top.Everything seemed affected. Bone\u2019s life from beginning of the novel \u2013 the ridiculousness of her mother trying to get that birth certificate righted \u2013 to the wholly unrealistic act that ended the book. I don't want to say what happened, but I do want to say, \"what the hell was that about?\" Made one wonder if, indeed, it was Bone\u2019s fault that Glen would go after her like that. He was already on watch from all of Bone\u2019s roughneck uncles. Didn\u2019t make sense at all, except for that it had to happen to have that particular ending.It all felt a little flat on purpose. So what? I kept asking. Since there were so many red herrings, so much left to assumption or speculation, it was hard to understand what exactly Dorothy Allison had in mind when writing it. \u201cLook at how hard these poor, Southern, white folks life is,\u201d is what it seemed to say. But who didn\u2019t know that? It's 2008 and a lot of poor Southern white folks have a hard time. And poor Northern white folks, too, for that matter.Okay, that\u2019s enough of that. I enjoyed all of the music references, and how song, many times, moved the story along. I was really interested to know the lyrics or the music of the songs I don\u2019t know to know what that particular song added to the story. But lately, my obsession has been food. That\u2019s all I tend to write about lately.I liked the way Allison used food as medium in the book: assuage grief and pain, show (relative) wealth and poverty, good times, bad times, et cetera. A couple of interesting quotes:\t\u201cPeople don\u2019t do right because of the fear of God or love of him. You do the right thing because the world doesn\u2019t make sense if you don\u2019t.\u201d Annie (Mama) 145Bone after getting baptized: \u201cIt was as if I were mourning the loss of something I had never really had. I sang along with the music and prayed for all I was worth. Jesus\u2019 blood and country music, there had to be something else, something more to hope for. I bit my lip and went back to reading the Book of Revelation, taking comfort in the hope of the apocalypse, God\u2019s retribution on the wicked.\u201d 152When Aunt Alma goes mad with rage at her husband Wade, Bone thinks: \u201cWomen all over Greenville County were going to smash stuff and then sit down to wait for Armageddon or sunrise or something.

Bastard Out of Carolina has been on my TBR ever since I first heard Mercedes from MercysBookishMusings' absolutely glowing review, and it sounded like everything I love in a book, and more besides. Maybe I was a victim of hype, but I found this really difficult to get through.The book is semi-autobiographical, and follows the child narrator Bone, and illegitimate child who suffers both physical and mental abuse at the hands of her cruel stepfather. She is angry, isolated, and hurt, despite being surrounded by a myriad of family members, and her mother is blind to the abuse because of her love for 'Daddy Glenn'.Overall, I thought the premise of this book was excellent - there were some truly heartbreaking scenes, particularly the ending, and some incredibly shocking moments. I really enjoyed the first 100 pages or so, with the story of Bone's birth and her mother raising her in the earlier years, and the first encounter with Daddy Glenn. Her family members as well are all excellent, well-rounded characters who fly off the page and have buckets of personality.However, I found that I was gradually losing interest through much of the middle-section of the book. I felt that the focus of the book, on Bone's home life and the abuse she had to deal with, became almost secondary to random tales and exploits with other family members. Although this was a bit of a relief in a way, as I wasn't having to read about truly horrific things, I still felt like the momentum that had been building in the novel was lost. Every time I put it down, I struggled to pick it back up again, and felt my eyes glazing over a lot of the time whilst reading. It definitely picked up again towards the end, but I just felt like the book was overly long which took away from the central plot.I can completely understand why people adore this book, and I think it's a great coming-of-age book in a way. But I can't deny that I struggled to maintain an interest in this for the majority of the book, and it just didn't live up to my expectations. I would love to see the film adaptation of this however, as it appears to be very loyal to the original text.

Allison deftly captures the psychological nuances of the situation at the same time, making clear to the reader some things the innocent narrator probably doesn\u2019t comprehend. One stunning moment that exemplifies this point comes when the mother, frustrated by her husband\u2019s inability to bring home enough money to feed the kids, tarts herself up, goes out, and returns later with a boatload of groceries. The reader instantly knows what\u2019s going on, but Bone seems to remain uncertain. Throughout, the writing is beautiful\u2014convincingly in Bone\u2019s voice, but touched by poetry (and thankfully unblemished by dialect).

It is a beautifully-written semi-autobiographical account of a childhood in 1950s-60s South Carolina. The protagonist, nicknamed Bone, is a victim of poverty and physical abuse, including sexual abuse. But she is also part of a big extended family, all of whom are poor, uneducated, loving, and protective. Allison lived this story and knew these people, which is why she is able to write about them so convincingly. Bone's mother is a complex and interesting character who either chooses not to protect her child or is unable to do so because she perceives her choices to be so limited.

You watch her mother be displayed as beauty on a platter. a woman looking to be loved and comes off strong only to be a coward all because she loves a man and it is said that you should not make a woman choose between a child and a man. a man who brutally beat her child (bone) numerous times, sexually assaulted her, and in the end, raped her so viscously. the roles her families play in this book is very important. as each member plays a key part in bone's emotions and upbringing. the family seemed doomed from the start but at times, they would come together to protect one another. each boatwright woman in this story is depicted as women who had to or will have to grow up fast and nothing would be easy for them (you can see by the aging described in their faces). the men are spoiled and reckless but always get a past. they drink and cause trouble everywhere they turn but no one messes with boatwright men. you get drawn to bone's character right away because she is so realistic. the hardest part was reading how her mother went back to daddy glen again and again. when the damage was completely done and bone was so fragile and needed all the love the world could offer, her mother left her to run off with him. the same woman who fought to be so independent. my heart cried for bone desperately. \"i could see her fingers on glen's shoulder, see the white knuckles holding him tight. my mouth closed over the shout i would not let go. rage burned in my belly and came up my throat. i'd said i could never hate her, but i hated her now for the way she held him ... i wanted everything to stop, the world to end, anything but not to lie bleeding while she held him and cried. i looked into the white sky going gray. the first stars would come out as the sky darkened. i wanted to see that, the darkness and the stars. i heard a roar far off, a wave of night and despair waiting for me, and followed it out into the darkness\"."}, {"userName": "Dusty Myers", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/423999-dusty-myers", "userReview": "One thing I know for sure is that Bastard out of Carolina is, in the end, a very conservative book. Its focus is on the family. Ruth Anne Boatwright is a girl born the titular bastard to a teenage mother, Annie, and an absent father. The mother remarries after she has another kid with a man who dies, and this man she marries\u2014Daddy Glen\u2014turns out in what has now become a cliche in the memoir/autobionovel genre to be abusive. First it's verbal/emotional, then it becomes physical/sexual. All the while, Annie turns a blind eye, or sees what's going on and gets really upset but then goes crawling back to Daddy Glen because she can't stand to be alone. The novel ends with this reconciliation between daughter and mother than rang, to me, completely false and sentimental. \"You're my own baby girl,\" Annie says. \"I'm not gonna let you go.\" And the line is so clearly another lie, yet Ruth Anne does everything in her narration to assert that this time she believed it, and therefore we should.Another problem I had with the book was its point of view. I don't remember what the problem was, exactly, just that a problem was had. I think it had something to do with the fact that for much of the book Ruth Anne doesn't do anything but watch her colorful family members yell and lie at one another. And then this combined with the book's insistence that we never question Ruth Anne's perspective on herself and the events of her narrative. It's like this depressing by-product of the Victim Narrative That Resists At All Costs Being Labeled A Victim Narrative. I fully submit that this is a matter of personal taste, not one of literary ideals or whatever.Like, I like my first-person narrated novels to be a bit more aware of the inherent unreliability of every first-person narrator ever. Bad memoirs are completely ignorant of this. \"I\" am witness, they say. \"I\" will tell you what you need to know. Novels, though, usually know better. Or, at least, they should."}, {"userName": "Book Concierge", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1628041-book-concierge", "userReview": "This is a fine work of literary fiction centering on a young girl's coming-of-age in the 1950s rural South, and fighting the label of \u201ctrash\u201d attached to her. Ruth Anne (\u201cBone\u201d) is born to her extremely beautiful 15-year-old mother shortly after an auto accident. In the confusion at the hospital her grandmother and aunt can\u2019t agree on her name and as a result her birth certificate bears the label \u201cIllegitimate.\u201d Her grandmother insists this makes no difference; the baby is still part of the Boatwright clan, who are tight-knit despite their drinking, fighting and womanizing. But Bone\u2019s mother, Anney, is mortified and determined to legitimize her daughter. When Anney marries Glen, the son of a well-to-do dairyman, it seems her life is set on the right path. However, when their first child is stillborn, Glen begins to take out his frustrations on Bone. Unable to fully understand, and ashamed to admit what is really happening, Bone nurtures her rage silently, while Anney, unaware of the extent of the abuse, stands by her man and dreams of a better life for her family. There are moments of brilliant writing in this work. I was particularly grateful for occasional laugh-out-loud passages (especially when Bone is describing her own lack of singing talent). Allison does a fine job of \u201cshowing\u201d us the characters, rather than telling us what they are like. Bone\u2019s ability to show compassion despite her rage is admirable. But she IS a child, and cannot be expected to always behave nobly. This is an emotionally wrenching read; some of the scenes are just horrific."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7051280-anne", "userReview": "This award-winning and wonderful novel is now on sale for Kindle for just $1.99.

The novel's profound portrait of family dynamics in the rural South won the author a National Book Award nomination and launched her into the literary spotlight. Critics have likened Allison to Harper Lee, naming her the first writer of her generation to dramatize the lives and language of poor whites in the South. Since its appearance, the novel has inspired an award-winning film and has been banned from libraries and classrooms, championed by fans, and defended by critics.Greenville County, South Carolina, is a wild, lush place that is home to the Boatwright family-a tight-knit clan of rough-hewn, hard- drinking men who shoot up each other's trucks, and indomitable women who get married young and age too quickly. At the heart of this story is Ruth Anne Boatwright, known simply as Bone, a bastard child who observes the world around her with a mercilessly keen perspective. When her stepfather Daddy Glen, \"cold as death, mean as a snake,\" becomes increasingly more vicious toward her, Bone finds herself caught in a family triangle that tests the loyalty of her mother, Anney-and leads to a final, harrowing encounter from which there can be no turning back.", "title": "Bastard Out of Carolina", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11975224-bastard-out-of-carolina", "average": 4.1, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436376027l/11975224.jpg", "reviews": 2371, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5599.Dorothy_Allison", "name": "Dorothy Allison"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Classics", "American", "Young Adult", "Novels"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11975224-bastard-out-of-carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52663.Bastard_Out_of_Carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25354.Bastard_Out_of_Carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108689-bastard-out-of-carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15925013-bastard-out-of-carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/879070.Bastard_Out_of_Carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6463867-bastard-out-of-carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/879069.Bastard_Out_of_Carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12136752-bastard-out-of-carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/879067.Bastard_Out_of_Carolina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91872.Trash", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91873.Two_or_Three_Things_I_Know_for_Sure", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68797.Cavedweller", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/91871.Skin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1643980.Bastard_Out_of_Carolina_Two_or_Three_Things_I_Know_For_Sure"]}
