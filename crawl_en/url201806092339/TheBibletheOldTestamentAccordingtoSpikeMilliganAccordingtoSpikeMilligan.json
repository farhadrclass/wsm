Still, there were some laugh aloud bits that made me look like an idiot in the eyes of the people aroud me!My favourite joke?\"And the eyes of them were both opened and they knew they were both naked, and Adam said to her, 'stand back, I don't kow how big this is going to get.' \"Well, that got a huge snort of laughter!Silly, funny and something to dip in and out of whenever you're in the mood.

However after a few pages I was bored but I can't leave a book unfinished so I ploughed on and the only way I could finish it was to read another book alongside it to break up the monotony and finally skim-reading the last 40 pages. Not the late Spike's finest work I'm afraid."}, {"userName": "David Campton", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6132768-david-campton", "userReview": "Not as long as the original, but not as many laughs either.
