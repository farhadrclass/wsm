The idea that someone who has an almost perfect life for 30 years, but who then has it a little bit tough for a short period of time is hard done by... just left me really shocked.It made me wonder if the author has any idea that for a huge percentage of the world's population...well, they would give anything to have had 30 years of such a perfect life; wonderful education, beauty, intelligence, caring family and friends, born into a wealthy country, basic safety and security, a job that pays well and is respected.....Even with what happened to her, she is still, what, better off and far more lucky than probably 80 - 90% of people around the world!? (She would STILL be one of the luckiest people I know!)The assumption underlying this book seemed to be that 'rich upper-middle class Americans' (and maybe rich people from other countries??) are owed a perfect life and have a right to feel very hard done by if anything bad ever happens to them.Was it just me, but was Nat's journey through cancer...ummm, not very brave or amazing at all? I thought she was really selfish and negative and well, it was all very average. Sure she could have coped with it worse, but there was nothing at all remarkable with what she did either. (She was very hard to like I thought, she didn't cope at all well or remarkably.)There was just no sense of gratitude at ALL for what she has already been given that I could see. That seemed to be what she saw as just her due, never mind that the vast majority of people are nowhere near so lucky. Never mind that some people are far far more ill and that this illness lasts for DECADES at a time.....I did cry in this book.... I cried with envy at what she could still do and how not-ill she was at the worst of her illness. Like many people with serious chronic illnesses, I would give anything to have even a day being only as 'ill' as she was... On one of her worst days, (which was meant to make you feel so sorry for her) she made some phone calls and left the house.....Many of us can only DREAM of such luxuries, and it has been YEARS since we experienced them... Many of us could only dream too of getting even 10% of the quality of medical care and support from friends and family she received or being 10% as able to do things as she was. (Sure she has a 50% chance of death, but she also had a 50% chance of having a perfectly normal life! Something many of us have no chance of at all.)I cried when she was so mad she had to use a wheelchair for a few days too when so many people I know are bedbound/housebound and far too ill to use a wheelchair, but would give anything to HAVE even a few days in one... to leave the house even occasionally.. to see a doctor even occasionally...I think Nat was lucky. Not brave, not hard done by, not amazing, not at all inspirational, but very, very LUCKY. I wonder does the author know what is happening in the world today? That not everyone in the world is living such a charmed and perfect existence as the wealthy and privelleged characters in this book. If so, why is there not even a short acknowledgement of this? The book seems to assume we are all living such charmed lives... I found this quite offensive and...ignorant.Yes, not everyone is in my situation... but so many people are dealing with all sort of horrible things all their lives; kids with serious disabilites that they have to care for for decades, being subject to severe abuse and neglect in childhood, having a severe mental illness, having your life put at risk for being gay in the wrong country, living in extreme poverty and fearing your children will die every day, and so on and so on. All much worse than this mild but scary illness...and a charmed first 30 years of life!If you have had any real problems in life or have a serious chronic illness, do not buy this book, it will likely only upset you as it did me. The writing was fine, quite good even, but the underlying social attitudes etc. left a lot to be desired. Perhaps her future books will be better though!"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1700667-erin", "userReview": "Unbeknownst to me....Somehow I always end up reading books about women with Breast Cancer...which is kinda weird since my mom passed away from breast cancer.

I'm a breast cancer survivor myself and although it's been a little over twenty years it still hit very close to home. In fact I had to remind myself that it wasn't happening to me all over again, it was happening to Natalie.I also didn't really like Natalie all that much in the beginning but I suspect I wasn't supposed to. Cancer is a life changing journey and I found Natalie's evolution to be realistic. It wasn't long before I was routing for her and by the end of the book I had become genuinely fond of who she had become.I highly recommend this book. In spite of the subject matter it is in no way a depressing read. Rather it is the funny, thoughtful and somewhat philosophical story of a cancer patient who realizes that she alone is responsible for making her own good fortune. That's uplifting, not depressing."}, {"userName": "Keris", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/183575-keris", "userReview": "Ever since I heard about Allison Winn Scotch's debut novel, The Department of Lost and Found, I've been looking forward to reading it. It's about Natalie Miller, political assistant to the senator of New York (shades of Hillary Clinton!) who's a total workaholic. Then one day her boyfriend Ned discovers a lump in her breast and... I'm trying not to use a cliche like 'her whole world turns upside down' but honestly, her whole world does go A over T.Not only does Ned pick the time immediately post-diagnosis to confess he's been planning on leaving her for another woman, but coping with chemo knocks Natalie for six, and her relationships with those closest to her start to change, too.

I side with the reviewers who didn't care much for this book which tries to combine Chick Lit with personal tragedy. The main character is difficult to like, even as she is soul searching and trying to reconnect with past failed relationships. I think the author was going for a character with an upbeat attitude even though faced with a serious illness, but somehow chemotherapy and shopping at Bloomingdales ( only the BEST for her) just didn't work. I had a tough time, both caring about snooty Natalie and finishing this book. That said, I think my daughters (about her same age ) may like it . 2 stars"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27577-jessica", "userReview": "While I appreciate the author's attempt at melding a chick lit scenario with the harsh realities of coping with cancer, I wasn't charmed enough by the heroine to invest her recovery or indeed her journey. I felt that the author had stretched my sympathies too far asking me to care about her recovery, her relationship with her mother, her devotion to her career, as well as the men she found her self drawn back to. I abhor that all female writers of a certain age are classified as chick lit, and wanted this book to be different. More on a commentary of the harsh realities of a young woman coping with the realities going through recovery on her own, versus trying to find meaning in her life by digging through her little black book and obsessing over her ob/gyn or her exboyfriend."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2267186-denise", "userReview": "I put this book on reserve at the library many weeks ago.

From the fresh wound of knowing that my 44 year old friend is facing the greatest battle of her life--this book hit me hard. What a \"timely\" read for me.

Which is very disappointing, really. (Not to say that chick lit is bad, it's just that this would've been so much better if it wasn't.) What makes this chick lit, you ask? Well, Natalie is battling with cancer, so we've already got a major page-turning plot here. But then, Scotch throws more elements into the mix! Which is great! But not when she throws in too many elements such as - Natalie's struggling relationship with her mother, her intense job and devotion to working, her best friend's wedding and her part in that.... Which is all fine. BUT THEN this is what really gets me: Natalie is given a diary from her therapist to help her resolve issues during chemo. Instead of dealing with other problems in her already hectic life, Natalie chooses to pursue her old boyfriends in order to figure out \"what went wrong\". And in all honesty, isn't that just a whole chick lit plot by itself? It wasn't necessary. Still, it could've worked. Except at the point when Natalie makes one of the best decisions she's made throughout the entire book, a lovely lovely climax... The book continues on. Scotch makes a huge mistake, as instead of leaving well enough alone, she chooses to try and wrap everything up when it really didn't need to be done.And yet, her ultimate undoing is how selfish Natalie comes across as. You can't help but feel sorry for her, due to her illness, but she is just... Extremely fortunate throughout the entire novel, and her whole attitude of ungratefulness for her wonderful friends, and entirely too-perfect life, often made me wonder if she deserved my pity at all. Anyway. With its boy-centered plot and only-somewhat-loveable protagonist, the interspersed philosophies Natalie discovers during her chemo treatment only slightly make up for it. But all in all, it's quite a nice change from regular chick lit, but chick lit it is all the same. Read it though; you might find it's exactly what you've been looking for."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2613327-becky", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. I knew of the author Allison Winn Scotch, but I'd never read anything by her. The subject of the book is heavier for sure, but the story pulls you in, and you feel the highs with Natalie, and the lows.I'm learning to appreciate more and more as a reader, especially the perspective it provides. For awhile you get to be an observer of another life - you can sometimes anticipate things they cannot. This is what I found during this story. I could see where there the story was going - not because it was predictable - but because it was how I wanted it to end up, and at times when Natalie would do things I would get frustrated, saying \"Don't you see he is not right for you?\" or \"Why are you being so stubborn?\"This book was full of some amazing one-liners - just thoughts or musings that stuck with me after I finished reading it.

While I did not always like Natalie, I did sympathize with what she was going through during chemo and the book kept me reading.

I w ould call this book vapid. I think I would call Nat and her friends pretty self absorbed about every strand of their hair and whether they have a man on their arm. Pretty desperate stuff. And pretty out of touch with how most women live their lives. Much less women fighting cancer.Everything is just too pat. And that includes the ending. Glad Nat went into remission but who cares about whether she and Zach go to Fiji. I just see it as vapid. I read it on a recommendation but none of the characters seemed very substantial to me.

Why shouldn\u2019t she? She\u2019s the top aide to a senator, young and determine and has a great political career ahead of her. The world Natalie carefully built comes crashing down when her doctor informs her, she has breast cancer. In an instant, her live-in boyfriend breaks up with her, her career is in jeopardy and whether she wants to or not, Natalie is forced to reflect on her life as she confronts her own mortality while fighting this life-threatening disease.As Natalie begins her chemotherapy treatments, she\u2019s assigned to Janice, a cancer therapist. Janice encourages her to keep a diary as an outlet for her feelings. As she writes her first journal entry, her mind begins to focus on her recent breakup with Ned. She isn\u2019t sure where their relationship went wrong and what caused Ned to finally end things. The more she ponders this, she begins to think about her past boyfriends. A plan then forms: she will revisit her past five loves by tracking down each man to determine what went wrong in their relationship. This is more about self-discovery for Natalie and not to rekindle an old-flame.I have to admit early on I didn\u2019t like Natalie very much. She seemed to be very cold and distant emotionally. She was very power-hungry and would do anything necessary to manipulate the situation in her favor. The more I began to read about Natalie\u2019s life and her battle with breast cancer, I slowly started to warm up to her and began to empathize with her.Keeping busy and focused on work while undergoing chemo is what\u2019s keeping Natalie in this fight. Her life is centered around her career. Without that, she wouldn\u2019t have anything to live for. This realization to her is powerful as things begin to shift at work and she\u2019s no longer viewed as irreplaceable. As Natalie continues journaling and reconnecting with past loves, she begins a transformation that leaves the reader feeling hopeful she will win this battle and will be given a second chance to live her life based on the lessons she has learned.The Department of Lost & Found is the author\u2019s debut novel, which at times I found hard to believe.

You actually start out with a not too nice impression of Natalie, she's an assistant to a Senator and she pulls no punches in getting her job done, making the Senator look good, even when it comes to spreading rumors about opponents. She is surrounded by female support, her friend, Lila, who previously dated Natalie's gynecologist, Zach, and her best friend, Sally, a reporter, who is getting married soon. Getting a cancer diagnosis is definitely not in Natalie's plans, particularly when her boyfriend, Ned, breaks up with her shortly after. She then begins a quest to find out from her past loves what went wrong, keeping notes in a diary as suggested by her counselor at the hospital. She pines the most for Jake, a singer on the rise, and is surprised to find her gynecologist, Zach, is interested in her to which her reply is, \"I have cancer\" to which he responds, \"I guess that makes you unavailable.\" As Natalie continues through her treatments, she begins learning about herself as well as the people around her; from the Senator, who reveals herself as a politician in the lowest form of the word; to Sally, who has been her constant support through treatments but refuses to back down from a story that will reveal the Senator's dirty laundry; to Jake, who shows back up and swears he loves her and will be there for her yet soon reverts back to his old ways, choosing his career over their relationship. Of course, alls well that ends well, and as Natalie realizes who she really is and starts taking a chance on this second chance she's been giving, you can see how wonderful her second chance at life is going to be."}, {"userName": "Anastasia Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5674186-anastasia-cynthia", "userReview": "Well, gue review kilat aja ya. Chicklit satu ini lagi-lagi berbeda dengan buku-buku yang gue pernah baca sebelumnya; pada umumnya chicklit punya pembawaan yang mengusung tema ceria, tapi \"The Department of Lost and Found\" ini malah mengusut perjalanan dari seorang penderita kanker bernama Natalie Miller (Nat). Dikisahkan pada sinopsis bahwa Nat memiliki sebuah kehidupan yang sempurna. Nyaris sempurna tentunya, pacar yang memiliki pekerjaan yang aneka ragam. Sebuah kedudukan yang keren, yang memiliki oposisi untuk mendepak petingginya yang kurang sigap. Nat benci Dupris. Ia mengatur sebuah persekongkolan dengan bawahannya, Kyle, agar dapat menggeser kedudukan pimpinannya itu.

Sudut pandang orang pertama memang dapat memaparkan semuanya, terutama dapat membuat pembaca ikut tersentuh dengan konflik-konflik batin yang dialami Nat. Namun, bagian yang kurang gue suka ada padaa gaya penceritaannya yang kurang pas untuk menginterpretasikan penderita kanker. Gue tahu benar, seorang yang mengalami kemoterapi sangatlah gak enak.

Scotch manages to take a very serious subject, cancer, and develop a story that is at times touching, at times hilarious, and at times achingly raw. In her book jacket bio, the author says that she lost a close friend to breast cancer and wanted to write a book with a happier ending. She accomplishes what she set out to do, but the reader is not spared any of cancer's wrath in the process.\"The Department of Lost & Found\" is the story of Natalie Miller, a ruthless senior adviser to a senator. She will let nothing stand in her way. When she is diagnosed with breast cancer, she tries to continue things as normal, but must face the fact that everything she has must now go into fighting this disease. Along the way, the reader sees cancer for what one can only imagine it is who doesn't have it....merciless. Natalie begins to understand that life is not for settling, and if she is lucky enough to get a second chance, she should live the life she wants to live.Scotch does not sugarcoat anything, including her main character.

On the one hand, it has a flawless writing style and you could read it fast and easily. But on the other hand, something was just missing. Because I found myself skipping some pages towards the end. Not because it was really boring and all but some things just bugged. Plus, the whole ex-boyfriend thing annoyed me. I am still not sure why that part needed to be in that book after all. I just didn't get it.Also, I found it hard to like the heroine, Natalie, your usual workaholic, kick ass woman with probably way too many self-esteem who suddenly got breast cancer. Of course, writing this book in a chick-lit way was different and I liked that but Natalie somehow annoyed me. Yes, she had cancer and was brave and all, I admired that, but the whole job thing with the senator annoyed. At the end, she knew what was worth and what not. A conclusion I already had after 10 pages. Whch resolves in not really liking and probably even caring for Natalie.Plus, despite trying to write a book about breast cancer in a different way, Allison Winn Scotch put every single clich\u00e9 in it you can think about. I was just wondering when she would come up with XYZ and bang, there it was.The ending was OK. But that's it. The book is OK, nice. Nothing more. You can either read it, or not.
