Based on the article's synopsis, I knew it was a book I wanted to read, so I ordered it immediately - in doing so, I have no regrets - what an insightful, creative, and often humorous read! Cion follows the travels of Toloki, a professional mourner (which in itself is an unusual profession), as he ventures to Southeastern Ohio (Appalachian country). It is in this rural, impoverished setting and through Toloki's eyes that American pop culture, politics, and other \"isms,\" such as racism, colorism, sexism, etc. are explored. A Halloween prank-gone-bad leads Toloki to form an unusual friendship with a local, rather eccentric family. His host family is self-described as WIN (White-Indian-Negro) and it is with them that the complexities of racial identity, prejudice, and stereotypes emerge. Mda uses his creativity and playwriting skills to construct scenes that evoke crystal clear images and crafty dialogue/arguments to cover aspects of African American history (a wonderfully imagined Underground Railroad escape is presented as a sub-plot) and its far-reaching impact on Americans today. Toloki's observations and internal thoughts/commentaries are oftentimes laugh-out-loud funny and laced with truth and heartfelt honesty. This book is definitely in my 2007 Top 10 list - I have already ordered his earlier works and look forward to the reading experience."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41925-carol", "userReview": "I was befuddled initially but so glad I stuck with it.

The author does a great job intervweaving a past story line with the present. The past story is about slavery in the US south; the current story is a \"professional mourner\" from South Africa who has come to the US to learn more about mourning."}, {"userName": "S.B.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4659463-s-b", "userReview": "A Big Thumbs DownThis book, Cion, by Zakes Mda, is very hard to read especially in the beginning. It is a far-fetched, disconnected story that jumps all over the place. To top it off the main character, Toloki, is a professional mourner. It is full of vile sexual content and foul language. The book recieved great praise by a few descendants who claim to have read it. Did they not see the insult to their people, be it true or not? I do feel that Mr. Mda captured the essence of the area, Kilvert, and \"some\" of the people as seen by outsiders. The people no matter whether black, brown, white, or some shade in between are all related. Mr. Mda's character, Toloki, doesn't understand this, being a true Black man from South Africia. He sees that the people are not all the same even tho they believe that they are, and that they cling to a long ago legend that they don't really know much about other than the oral history they present. He touches on the inner conflict, prejudice and pretense amongst some of these people, and in my opinion he is not totally wrong in that observation. Some of the people say they are colored or black, some are anything but black, some are Indian, Irish is a curse, white is a bad word. The solution to this is...call us WIN (White, Indian, Negro). The people Mr. Mda came to befriend, as he calls it, and interview for his book gave him the impression of not knowing who they are. I can understand that thru Mda's broader scope of vision in the world and mainstream societies. It is true that they, the people, all have a different version of what their race is...sometimes even in the same family. He also captures the attitude that \"some\" have about living in poverty; blaming the outside world, or the past and not taking responsibility for themselves. At any rate, Mr. Mda can call it fiction, but I could pick out many of the characters and stories he was writing about...Those he interviewed were obviously trusting of him, befriending him and praising him without even reading the book. It is a very insulting book. If you have people in the area, or come from the area you would feel something in your heart, no matter what your beliefs or understanding of the family history, no matter your racial self-identification. I felt truly saddened and nauseated at the way this man used these people to make fun of all of them and their stories in his book. I'll just add the book to my collection because it mentions so many of our places and people, although with a very twisted and insulting version, yes he calls it fiction, but it is insulting, whether he meant it to be or not. Mr. Mda does not treat the subject with any respect or sensitivity, instead he seems to make fun of the history and the people of Kilvert. The Washington Post saw it that way (see below, read the definitions!). Mda's character Toloki comes off as the Black intellect amongst the mixed up, not so bright people of Kilvert. As much as an insult this is to many of the people in the area, and as sad and angry as it made me feel while reading the book, unfortunately if the shoe fits they'll have to wear it. This Washington Post Review says it like it is: \"One of the most prolific black writers of post-apartheid South Africa, Zakes Mda, has now cast his roaming, wry (wry means marked by or displaying contemptuous mockery of the motives or virtues of others: cynic, cynical, ironic, ironical, sardonic) and satirical (satirical means contemptuous or ironic in manner or wit: derisive, jeering, mocking, sarcastic, satiric, scoffing, sneering) eye upon the United States, in particular the rural southeastern Ohio community outside of Athens, Ohio (where, incidentally, Mda teaches at Ohio University). I give it a big thumbs down!"}, {"userName": "Deborah Waugh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2779601-deborah-waugh", "userReview": "This is a wonderful book written by a South African, now an American, who lived through the apartheid in his country. I was amazed at how well he portrayed the events of American slavery showing how two brothers, one sired by a white man and the other by a slave, escape to freedom via the designs on the quilts their mother made for them. One of the quilts survived through one of the brothers, giving only half a story to his present day descendants. As a result, the family\u2019s matriarch holds her family in a bondage to what she believes is her family\u2019s tradition, leaving no room for creativity, originality, or change. Zakes Mda is a fabulous author."}, {"userName": "Shamekia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1409316-shamekia", "userReview": "This book was definitely something else! I really liked it, but still don't quite know what to make of it. It's well-written and I really like the way Mda weaves the chapters through past and present(I have a special affinity for any author who \"plays\" with time in narrative). This book also made me go and do my own research on breeding plantations, as I had no clue they existed. All in all, I'd recommend it for anyone who's looking for a fresh voice, and a unique (to say the least) point of view on African-American history/life."}, {"userName": "Barbara Rhine", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31033276-barbara-rhine", "userReview": "A South African author has written this unusual book about the contemporary American South.

Lured to Athens, Ohio, by an academic at the local university, Toloki makes friends with an angry young man he meets at a Halloween parade and soon falls in love with the young man's sister. Toloki endears himself to a local quilting group and his quilting provides a portal to the past, a story of two escaped slaves seeking freedom in Ohio.Making their way north from Virginia with nothing but their mother's quilts for a map, the boys hope to find a promised land where blacks can live as free men.
