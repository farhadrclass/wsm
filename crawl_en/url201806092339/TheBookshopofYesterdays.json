THIS BOOK IS AS DELICIOUS AS HOMEMADE PEACH ICE CREAM!...with mystery-literary clues sprinkled on top!!! \u201cEvery family has its unspoken stories. Billy was ours. It didn\u2019t matter whether or not it was sad\u201d. Miranda grew up in Southern California as an only child. Her mother tells her that she was named after one of the main characters in Shakespeare\u2019s play \u2018The Tempest\u2019. Miranda, the daughter of Prospero, was her mother\u2019s favorite female literary character. As a small child, Miranda thought of her Uncle Billy as her superhero. And when she was too old to believe in superheroes, she still believed in Billy. Billy made the world safer.He was a seismologist. Miranda felt pride of his importance. He taught her almost everything she knew\u2026 giving her lessons in geology and biology and evolution disguised in adventures. He taught her about the world and how it collided and evolved, and how their lives were shaped by the movements at the earth. Miranda had remembered the Northridge earthquake. It was one of those nights in Southern California that everyone remembered. Her best friend, Joanie was sleeping over. They were asleep when startled by books falling off the shelves. The night was chaotic. Mom and dad were screaming that they needed to get out of the house. There were aftershocks- broken glass on their hardwood floor - and the kids had bare feet. Joanie clung tightly to Miranda shaking and scared, but everyone was safe & sound. Miranda said: \u201c The earth had moved here, beneath my feet, and that meant Billy wouldn\u2019t have to travel to some other distant land to study the damage. He would stay here with us. That was the best gift Billy gave me as a child. When ever the earth shook, I became excited once the confusion subsided. At some point, I\u2019d stopped connecting that feeling to Billy, but it never went away. Even as an adult, I felt a guilty pleasure whenever the floor oscillated with the earth\u201d. Miranda thought the world of her Uncle\u2014 and he called her \u201cmy favorite girl\u201d.Besides being a seismologist, Billy owned a neighborhood bookstore on Sunset Boulevard in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. \u201cProspero Books\u201d was his \u2018fun\u2019 job he told Miranda. Miranda loved the teen books she discovered and the scavenger hunts Billy planned for her. \u201cProspero Books, where books are prized above dukedom\u201d. AGE AGE 12..... Miranda\u2019s heart was broken. Uncle Billy and her mother had an awful falling out. Billy went away.....and she never saw him again. The last words Billy said to her were: \u201cThings with me and your mom, whatever happens, I just want you to know it isn\u2019t your fault\u201d. It never occurred to Miranda that it was her fault.... but she went through grief - loss - and anger. He left her with no explanation. Her mother wouldn\u2019t talk about it. Her father\u2019s lips were sealed. \u2014 Everyone had secrets and hurts. Yet.......for the next 16 years ..... Billy slowly became non-existent. Then one day.........Miranda was 27 years old, living in Philadelphia, teaching 8th grade history, and living with her boyfriend Jay.....( \u201ctesting the waters of cohabitation for the first time). Miranda receives a package in the mail - later a phone call - that will bring her back to Los Angeles filled with curiosity- thoughts of Uncle Billy - her parents - carrying a message with her that she knows she\u2019s heard some place before:\u201cUnderstanding prepares us for the future\u201d. Uncle Billy left a non-traditional legacy of understanding, inviting forgiveness and love , with literary clues..and pizzazz! It\u2019s easy to fall in love with the characters. It\u2019s hard to believe this is a debut novel. Amy Meyerson is a terrific writer. I enjoyed many little details she created too. Miranda\u2019s mother use to be a lead singer for a band called \u201cLady Loves\u201d....her dad once owned 200 ties........and oh my gosh, the food that came out of this family\u2019s kitchen made me hungry for good old fashion yummy foods before -gluten free - sugar free and no taste free....lolPancakes- French omelettes- steaming warm blueberry muffins- chocolate chip cookies- lasagna....even cool whip and strawberries! Scrumptious-heavenly-and page turning heart-endearing reading!!!Thank You Harlequin Trade Publishing, Netgalley, and Amy Meyerson"}, {"userName": "Scarlett", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53419883-scarlett", "userReview": "4.5 stars\u201cAt the beginning, it seems like a play about vengeance but it\u2019s really about forgiveness.\u201d \u2013Amy Meyerson\nThe TempestJane EyreAlice\u2019s Adventures in WonderlandFrankensteinFear of FlyingPersuasionThe Grapes of WrathBridge to Terabithia\n\u201cWhatever clue it held, wherever Billy wanted to lead me I didn\u2019t want to follow anymore\u201d-Amy MeyersonAs a young child, Miranda loved her uncle Billy. He always had the neatest ideas to keep her busy. Because Miranda was a clever girl, Billy often made up riddles for her to solve.

While the plot split between the family dynamics and Miranda\u2019s thoughts, Billy\u2019s mystery was a gradual slow burn that would not let up. This very creatively crafted riddle, slowly unfolded, while playing out Miranda\u2019s relationship with her mother, boyfriend and all those she ends up meeting along the way from Billy\u2019s past and \"Prospero Books\".I very much enjoyed this touching book. It resolves into an unforeseen ending of love and forgiveness, as all the family members come clean and a big secret is revealed. The nostalgia of the bookstore was lovely and the title of the novel befitting perfectly as it makes all sense at the end. A lovely, touching novel.

But, I want to go on record stating that The Bookshop of Yesterdays is destined to be one of this summer's great read! Amy Meyerson introduces us to very relatable characters who must navigate through love, loss, friendship and, of course, family drama. Through the heroine, Miranda Brooks, Meyerson asks us to consider how we define ourselves, our families, and our community. We follow Miranda as she walks through her own truth in order to define who she is. (Something that we all must do for ourselves). \n\"Understanding prepares us for the future\".\nI must acknowledge my husband, Leo, for bringing this ARC home about 3-4 months ago. Through his job, he received a copy of the book from Park Row books. Leo told me that once he read the premise and saw that a bookstore serves as the story's backdrop, he knew that he had to share The Bookshop of Yesterdays with me. There is no doubt that Park Row has a bestseller on its hands. I hope you get a chance to read this book. You will not be disppointed."}, {"userName": "Robin Bonne", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43171956-robin-bonne", "userReview": "On Miranda\u2019s twelfth birthday, she witnesses a fight between her mom and Uncle Billy. Eventually, their falling out causes Miranda to virtually forget her uncle, so she is surprised to learn of his death and that she inherited his failing bookshop, Prospero Books. Her parents refuse to answer her questions about the past, but her uncle has sent her on one last scavenger hunt to unravel the mystery that tore her family apart. As she uncovers the clues and searches for answers, she grows into the woman she was meant to become. Meyerson wrote emotionally complex, perfectly imperfect characters. The employees of the bookstore charmed me into hoping they could all save the bookstore. The only one I could not grow to love was that awful boyfriend, Jay, and I badly wanted Miranda to dump him.The literary reference clues blended into the story beautifully, never once feeling out of place. Books about books, libraries, or bookstores warm my heart, and this book was successfully executed within its setting. Every loose end was wrapped up by the final pages which was satisfying.

She slowly follows clues with literary ties, that tie in with a bookstore from her youth. She goes down the rabbit hole and does not come out the same.This has been such a long read, interesting but dragged on with the drama. The author just took so long to get the mystery solved and didn't spend enough time writing about the books she obviously loves. The mystery was apparent early in the story, so that part of the story didn't hold my interest. I was reading to follow the clues because they had to have some really cool outcome, right ? The tricky clues so elaborate delivered after death must lead to an extraordinary truth. No, there was no great reveal I'm not sure if I enjoyed it or was annoyed more by the meandering slow pace. I was left wondering what happened to the emerald earrings, yeh that bugged me, they came into the story at a pivotal point and then just disappeared and nobody asked about them. There were at lot of dangling points in the story, I wanted more family history answers, or more book store. The two parts of the story felt separate, the book store part felt complete, leaving the family drama feeling incomplete."}, {"userName": "Caitlin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30903220-caitlin", "userReview": "I received this as an ARC and I can\u2019t wait for it to come out June 2018 so I can begin recommending it to everyone.

I requested it from NetGalley because I wanted a small respite from the more noir/darker mysteries that I've been reading lately. I expected it to be much fluffier than it was. THE BOOKSHOP OF YESTERDAYS is a lovely, smart novel that followed a young woman's journey to fulfill her purpose in life, and how we don't always know where that path will take us. After the death of her uncle, Miranda follows clues in an epic literary scavenger hunt to discover more about her past than she even thought possible. I loved the intricacies of the familial relationships in this debut, and even though I saw the \"twist\" coming, I still wanted to read about how Miranda was affected by the upheaval in her life.

The Bookshop of Yesterdays is about Miranda, a history teacher on the east coast who's estranged uncle dies and leaves her not only his bookstore in LA but also the clues to a family mystery. The premise is interesting enough and I am always a fan of books about books. My two main problems with this story are the characters and the 'mystery' Miranda is solving . Beyond Miranda and her mother's character (somewhat) they all fall flat. No one feels like a fully fleshed out person. The people at the bookstore, both the workers and the regulars feel more like quirky character ideas of people than real people. They were funny ideas of people rather than whole fleshed out beings. The mystery was fairly easy to guess at. Which because this isn't a mystery novel wasn't bad just kinda boring. It again felt like drama for the sake of it. My main positive of this book is that you can tell the author loves books, reading and the culture that comes with it. I wish she had spent more time on the books she loves and the meaning they had to Miranda and her uncle. It might have helped give the story a denser flavor.

She starts to think about other people's feelings, and then just turns and it's all about her again. I get that she was mourning the loss of Billy, and that she felt betrayed/lied to, but at no time did she ever actually thank her Mom and Dad for stepping up, raising her as their own child, and loving her.

Even if they're not particularly amazing, something about the premise always seems so magical, yet comfortable...like you're greeting an old friend. And even though The Bookshop of Yesterdays didn't wow me, it was still a little bit like this.The Good: Again, the premise is amazing! I love books about books, particularly when there is a bookstore or library at its forefront. Prospero Books seems like it would be an awesome bookstore to visit. You have used, sometimes cheap, books, a cafe right next to it, and employees who know what books they're talking about. I absolutely loved learning about it and I loved its sometimes kooky clientele. If The Bookshop of Yesterdays was mostly about Prospero Books, I would have loved it. I also really liked some of the familial angst. Oh, I also really liked the resolution of the romance at the end of the novel. It was really well done. The Eh: The mystery surrounding The Bookshop of Yesterdays went on way too long that it started to drag about a third of the way through. I think the whole quest thing seemed more elaborate in idea than in execution. The familial angst also slightly dragged. Again, I'm a huge fan of familial angst, but in this book, it felt like the familial angst was just dealing with the same issue over and over again, and it didn't really do this book any favors. More Eh: The author does this (in my opinion) weird thing when there is a flashback. She starts it out with the person talking to Miranda actually talking about the flashback and then has Miranda sort of paraphrase what the person was saying in her POV. I found it so incredibly clunky and it took me out of the book every single time it happened. I feel like it would have been better if the flashbacks were separate chapters. It would've made it less clunky, at least. I also feel like we should have gotten way more with Miranda and her Dad. He really didn't do much. He could've been completely omitted from the book and nothing would have changed.In the end, I merely liked The Bookshop of Yesterdays. It had a lot of potential, but certain things kept me from really loving it.

I fell deeply in love with this story and indeed spent a couple nights reading past my bedtime to discover the truth along with Miranda."}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29620981-lindsay", "userReview": "Well developed, relatable, complex characters are what usually pulls me into a book. The relationships between the characters keeps me reading! The author does a great job of making Miranda, her family, and all of the people she meets along the way feel like long lost friends. The book is filled with complex family dynamics which keep the reader engaged in the story and waiting to find out what is going to happen next. I found myself thinking about what would happen next and where the characters may be today long after reading, which to me is a sign of great book! I look forward to June when the book is out so I can send my fellow readers out to get their own copy!"}, {"userName": "Fictionophile ", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428094-fictionophile", "userReview": "Schoolteacher Miranda Brooks reaches a crossroads in her life when she learns of her Uncle Billy's death.\u00a0 He was a big and very important part of her childhood years, but a family rift resulted in her not seeing him for over a decade.\u00a0 Her mother, unable to find forgiveness in her heart, does not attend her brother Billy's funeral, so Miranda goes alone. With promises to her live-in boyfriend Jay, she embarks from their home in Philadelphia, on what she thinks will be a visit home lasting about a week.When she was a child, Uncle Billy would take her on adventures. These adventures were usually didactic and often included riddles. Frequently, they ended up at Billy's bookstore, Prospero Books.\u00a0 Miranda always loved it there, and Billy would let her choose a book every time. Miranda was named for the Shakespeare character in the play \"The Tempest\".\u00a0 The bookstore's sign showed a picture of Prospero holding his staff in one hand and a book in the other.\"Billy called seismology his real job, Prospero Books his fun job.\"Miranda learns that Billy has left her his beloved bookstore, Prospero Books, which is located in Silver Lake, Los Angeles. Some would say that her inheritance is more of a burden than a windfall. Like many independently owned bookstores, Prospero Books is struggling to make ends meet.\"We had competing recollections of the past, but one wasn't more right than the other\".It seems that Billy has one more adventure for Miranda. One more riddle to solve.\u00a0 He leaves his obscure clues in books scattered throughout the store. She befriends the store's meagre staff, including the taciturn though handsome manager, Malcolm. As she attempts to fend off creditors, and keep the store open, Miranda repeatedly delays her flight back to Philadelphia.\u00a0 \u00a0She and her mother aren't speaking, and she feels she can't leave with things as they are. Whilst trying to mend her relationship with her mother, she finds out some life-altering family secrets.Meanwhile, her trip home keeps getting delayed...~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Miranda's story was engaging, though predictable.\u00a0 I guessed what the big family secret was, which somewhat marred the reading experience for me. I was impatient for Miranda to realize what I had already guessed.\u00a0 I very much enjoyed the atmosphere of the novel with its charming bookstore and myriad book references. I felt that the riddles were too obscure for most readers, but that the novel was well rendered on the whole.This is a novel about family secrets, forgiveness, new beginnings, and the destructive nature of miscommunication. A worthy debut novel that I enjoyed enough to look forward to what this author writes next."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/987336-sarah", "userReview": "The word \"bookshop\" in the title was enough for me to pluck this off the shelf and into my hot little hands. (That's not really true, my hands generally run cold.) In many ways, this novel is an ode to independent bookstores, to those reading aficionados who still prefer to peruse the aisles of their local (if they should happen to be so fortunate) shops rather than clicking on Amazon. Lovers of literature will undoubtedly warm at the mention of many familiar titles and authors. Books are an integral part of the story.Miranda Brooks spent her early years delighting in the excitement her beloved Uncle Billy managed to create. He never simply gave her a gift, a scavenger hunt was always involved. On the night of her twelfth birthday she overhears bits and pieces of a viscous argument between her mother and uncle, never to hear from him again. Fast forward sixteen years: Uncle Billy has died, bequeathing her his small, struggling bookshop. True to character, he has also left clues about the long buried secret that tore her family apart. Uncovering the truth and trying to keep the failing business afloat become her mission. What she learns threatens her relationships and causes her to question everything she has ever believed about her life.As much as I took pleasure in this book, I am going to add that I found Miranda frustrating. That girl can hold one heck of a grudge! Sakes, alive, child, give people a break! It was difficult for me to understand the depth of her anger. The reason I mention this is because it surprised me that the central character could be someone with whom I could scarcely identify yet it did not hinder my enjoyment of the novel itself.If you work at a bookstore, love bookstores, or simply adore books, pluck this one off the shelf."}], "description": "A woman inherits a beloved bookstore and sets forth on a journey of self-discovery in this poignant debut about family, forgiveness and a love of reading.Miranda Brooks grew up in the stacks of her eccentric Uncle Billy's bookstore, solving the inventive scavenger hunts he created just for her. But on Miranda's twelfth birthday, Billy has a mysterious falling-out with her mother and suddenly disappears from Miranda's life. She doesn't hear from him again until sixteen years later when she receives unexpected news: Billy has died and left her Prospero Books, which is teetering on bankruptcy--and one final scavenger hunt.When Miranda returns home to Los Angeles and to Prospero Books--now as its owner--she finds clues that Billy has hidden for her inside novels on the store's shelves, in locked drawers of his apartment upstairs, in the name of the store itself. Miranda becomes determined to save Prospero Books and to solve Billy's last scavenger hunt. She soon finds herself drawn into a journey where she meets people from Billy's past, people whose stories reveal a history that Miranda's mother has kept hidden--and the terrible secret that tore her family apart.Bighearted and trenchantly observant, The Bookshop of Yesterdays is a lyrical story of family, love and the healing power of community.
