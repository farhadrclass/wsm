Twice! I mean, sure, it was basically just because I spent 12 of my 48 hours of friends and family Christmas visiting blitz-time alone in my car, and I didn't want to cause a fatal wreck by constantly readjusting the radio station on my cheap ipod plug-in or blindly sifting through scratched CD's while navigating holiday traffic, but how's this for a silver lining? Stephen Colbert reads his own book. Score! He could word-for-word recite Twilight to me like it's poetry and I would sit Indian-style on the floor just totally fucking enraptured. He's one Cool Cat(holic), that Stephen.Since the length of this thang isn't exactly making Dirk Diggler blush, I don't want to overly quote-pluck. Also, I'm just too lazy to transcribe anything from the CD's. I get paid to enter data, and I am not at work as of approximately 30 minutes ago. Regardless, I will say that the section on pharmaceutical drugs is more than enough of a sell on the book, so maybe start there if you're having doubts about time-investment. From Ritalin (prescribed for ADHD, characterized by things like difficulty concentrating, sudden mood-swings, and being a child), to Xanax (for symptoms frequently associated with human life), to Airborne (most effective when used on patients who approach medicine with \"the naive wonder of a 3rd-grader\"), Stephen lays out his faves, rallies for support of Big Pharma, and lifts his nose to Obamacare. Is funny. Is very, very funny.Here is where I get sappy. Look away, tough guys, and recommence bench-pressing. I just want to say that it sorta blows my mind in the best way that comedy like this, the views it espouses when you realize it's sarcastic--sorry, but I once had to tell an NRA-nut redneck bar-regular that Stephen Colbert is a satirist, and he didn't believe me at all--has such a large fanbase in America. I mean, it's so easy to think that most people are backwards idiots. Well, maybe not most people, but lots of people. Then again, I grew up in Oklahoma, so ya know. Any time I watch The Daily Show or The Colbert Report, the smoke of fatalism deep inside my chest briefly ceases choking me near-completely, and I think maybe it's all going to be alright in the end. That sounds hammy, I know, but it is Christmas, and Christmas is often associated with ham consumption.Last thought: I very distinctly remember the first time I watched Colbert's launchpad, The Daily Show. I was a Junior in high school returning home after a night out with some friends. My head was in...let's just say \"a strange place.\" My mother had the lights off in the living room and the television on super-loud. Thinking it wise not to do what I really, really wanted to do and run to the shelter of my room to listen to music on headphones and chew all my fingernails off, I casually (at least I think it was casually) sat down on the couch and joined her in watching what I believed to be a news broadcast. Words left the mouth of the sharply-dressed fellow on the screen, and before I knew it, the most obnoxious horsey-laugh galloped out of my mouth. I quickly covered my face with both hands to silence myself, sheer terror grasping me as the little me inside my head was smacking the insides of my stupid cranium and wanting nothing more than to take back the last 5 seconds where I totally revealed myself. I had my eyes closed just waiting for the inevitable \"what the hell is wrong with you?\" when a rush of relief swept over me; my mother was laughing as hard as I was. I slowly opened my eyes and noticed that rather than piercing me with her expert accusatory gaze (her cold stare of parental disappointment could freeze a blowtorch), my mother still had her back to me and was giggling like crazy, totally sucked into this strange little show. Even though she doesn't know it, it was a moment of deep bonding between us which I probably read too much into at the time, but still smile when I think about. She's...like me. I may tell her what I felt that night and why when she's on her death-bed, assuming I live that long and she has dementia at the time. How's that for an American tale, folks? We have since watched countless hours of Colbert and Stewart together. I will be mailing this audio book to her once I've listened to it a few more times, and she will love it as much as you will. Oh, AND YOU WILL. Happy Horror Days!"}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Another one? Ugh, what is it with me and duds lately? America Again: Re-becoming the Greatness We Never Weren't feels forced, as if it was pushed out to meant a contract or capitalize on a previous success. It doesn't help that Colbert hams it up by acting put upon by his publisher to rush out another book. The thing is, stripping that away, this feels hurried and light on content. Ooooh the filler! Sooooo much filler. This has more filler than an embalmed Phyllis Diller. What's that even mean? Doesn't matter, because you see what I did there? Just padded my word count, thank you very much! Too often that's what you get in America Again. Bummer. I expected I'd enjoy this way more, because I've always gotten some good laughs from Colbert.Of course you also get a fair amount of that wonderfully tongue-in-cheek Colbert humor; that razor-sharp wit. America and what's wrong with it from the perspective of his faux conservative talk show host character provides most of the content, which admittedly got at least two solid snort-chuckles out of me. Maybe two and a half. And that's basically how I rated this one. It's a 2.5 at best. Unfortunate, because I love Stephen Colbert. I just don't love this book."}, {"userName": "Kris", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1146002-kris", "userReview": "got my advance copy and enjoying it already. jealous?"}, {"userName": "David Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12817127-david-anderson", "userReview": "I would love to write a review on this incredibly funny, and 100% Colbert-esque book, but in the Terms and Conditions that I had to agree to in the first few pages, I had to agree to not share this book or even think about it during sex to delay orgasm.

What I really liked about this book was that his humour was even more intricate and surreal than in The Colbert Report - it's not just a simple extension of the show.

Colbert didn't write the book on his own, but the humor is relatively the same as that of his show. I highly recommend the audiobook for this reason because having Colbert actually read the book makes it massively more entertaining than sitting down and reading through what is much like a script of a long episode of Colbert Report. For fans, give it a chance, as I thought the book started off rather slow and picked up later on."}, {"userName": "Siria", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/115473-siria", "userReview": "Writing his books\u2014America Again is a follow-up to his previous I Am America and So Can You\u2014clearly allows Stephen Colbert to indulge in slightly more surrealistic tangents than he can on his show. I recommend listening to this one in audiobook, because I think Colbert's voice and his bone-dry delivery really helps to sell some of those moments, which I think might otherwise read a little flat on the page. Some of the humour can be a little juvenile, but there are layers upon layers of quite satisfying irony, sarcasm and wry observation here\u2014as ever, if there's some opinion you find you share with conservative pundit-Stephen, you know that there's something you need to reconsider\u2014concealing what is nevertheless an obvious and blazing anger.As the President of the Colbert Super PAC writes: \u201cJust because the election is over, doesn\u2019t mean you have to give up on what inspired you to start a super PAC in the first place: Money. You can use your remaining cash however you please! Hire Sarah Palin\u2019s relatives as \u2018consultants.\u2019 Buy clothes for Sarah Palin. Pay for hotel rooms for Sarah Palin. Off the top of my head, I can think of at least one Sarah Palin who\u2019s done very well for herself that way.\u201dIt may not be subtle, but it's gloriously pointed."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6316460-becky", "userReview": "As usual Colbert is on point with his topics, his allegories, and metaphors to make us realize the ridiculously ramshackle and insane our country and government functions around us.

And what better way to start the year 2013 than reading and reviewing the book that has everything? In fact, it has so much of everything that I used every single one of my shelves to label it. I'm pretty sure that I'm still short a couple subjects. Sure, I could've been reading Anna Karenina and learning about Imperial Russia with the rest of my book group instead of learning about the present American stuff I already know. But since my reading goal this year is 100 books - which is like reading everything - I should start my odyssey with the book that has everything. Everything American, that is. Anna Karenina just has affairs and trains and Keira Knightly and other stuff.Tolstoy's book doesn't have anything that Colbert's book doesn't have. Anna Karenina has extramarital affairs: America Again has illicit relations between politicians and food. Anna Karenina has people who hate their jobs: America Again has resume how-tos. Anna Karenina has 2-D: America Again has 3-D.Anna Karenina has Siberia: America Again has North Dakota.Anna Karenina was translated into English: America Again was written in American.It's probably this last one where Tolstoy has managed to one-up Colbert. America Again has no, count them: none, award winning translators. We're just expected to understand paragraphs like: \"But the Real Question is: are America's best days behind us? Of course they are, and always have been. We have the greatest history in the history of History. But never forget, our best days are also ahead of us, and always will be. Because America also has the Greatest Future in the history of the Future. It's our Present that's the problem...and always is be.\" I mean, Colbert began two sentences in that paragraph with But. And fragments. You just don't do that. A good translator would've saved him some face-saving."}, {"userName": "Loveliest Evaris", "userReviewDate": "Sep 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4425018-loveliest-evaris", "userReview": "I absolutely LOVE Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart. Jon Stewart cuts through all the flak and crap and actually TELLS ME what's happening in the political arena, while Stephen Colbert basically tells me what's NOT happening -- see, whatever he says, you basically think he means the opposite: simple!That being said, I was soooo ready to dive into this book.I've read \"I Am America (And So Can You!)\" by him, so I was ready for something similar.What I got was a meaner and raunchier sequel. I haven't seen every episode of the Colbert Report, but usually he keeps his humor fairly clean; but this was like he was off the clock and could be as inappropriate as he wanted. And he was. After chapter 2 things went very mature in some places, but the laughs still kept coming. I read the Medical Coverage sheets to my friends at the lunch table and we couldn't stop laughing. Some of the things were just so out-of-the-blue that I couldn't HELP but laugh!By the time we got to Food, the funny train was slowing down. I just didn't care much for it. It was only sardonic smiles from there-on-out.

Let me tell you my 5 month history with this book.I ordered it in mid-December because it was on sale and my friend said it was a good book to read. I had been exposed to Stephen Colbert\u2019s show a few weeks before so I took a chance. All of my books got delivered except this one and I didn\u2019t notice until a month later. I called Barnes and Noble and they sent me another copy. I got it mid-February. I was so excited to read it and I was so bored. I read about 1/3 of it and did not find it funny at all. I didn\u2019t pick it up until a few weeks ago when my friend told me to just get it over with and finish it. I read the last 2/3rd in one sitting. I enjoyed it more this time than the first time I started reading it. I found some of it funny, but not all of it. I think Stephen Colbert is half content and half presentation. In the book we are exposed to just content. It is very hard to read because it just sounds so\u2026annoying. I found myself just rolling my eyes at the book, sometimes a few times on the same page! I think this would have been a great book to listen/follow to on audiobook. I think you need someone who will be able to deliver the zingers and put emphasis and sarcasm in the correct parts for it to be enjoyed at its fullest potential.

Colbert's first book was from the closing days of the Bush administration. It was funny, but ultimately wore out it's welcome before it finished. This book was from the middle of the Obama years and effectively captured the madness that has taken hold of the collective conservative brain during that time. The paradox of this is the greatest country on Earth vs. this country has gone straight to hell! We're all gonna die!I probably enjoyed this more because this insanity is what we're still going through during this election season. Oddly enough, Colbert's faux-fire and brimstone falls short of what the Republican candidates are saying now but even he couldn't have anticipated Trump. Oh, wonderfully crazy Trump.I felt like the satire in this book just worked better. The Colbert Report gradually evolved from mockery to an effective tool for social change.

Sir Dr. Stephen T. Mos Def Colbert, D.F.A. The comedian discusses American Exceptionalism, the inherent greatness of the American way of life. Regardless of their consequences, Colbert reaffirms the established American traditions of jobs, healthcare, Wall Street, energy, elections, justice, and food. His arguments are embellished with hilarious images, graphs, testimonials and questionnaires.Colbert uses his conservative persona and follows our culture's rhetoric with a twisted logic that somehow always ends up conveying ironic truth. Playing with perspective makes America Again a multifaceted comedic treat that satirizes politics and consumerism. Colbert has the divine ability to make us laugh at the things that would normally make us cry.

And I didn't come in with high expectations, so it's really saying something for me to have been disappointed.This book isn't funny. The moments that made me laugh were few and far between, significantly fewer than those in I Am America (And So Can You!). The writing is over-the-top. It's so excessive that it's totally unrealistic and unbelievable, and comes across as just plain dumb. Colbert is a smart, funny man, and can be a great satirist, but after awhile, it falls flat.The only chapter worth reading, in my opinion, is \"Wall Street.\" It was sharper than the others. The rest of the book, however, was nonsensical. By now, Colbert is trying too hard, and failing.And WHAT IS THE COVER? MAKES NO SENSE. Why is he covered in cuts and bruises and burn marks?

The writing style, while amusing, critiques American society to some extent but then leaves you mostly unfulfilled as it never quite drives the point home. I know, I know, it's satire; it's only meant to make you think! I simply felt that much of this book pointed out obvious flaws in American or other contemporary societies' rhetoric (immigrants bad! guns good!) while never truly criticizing anything. That being said, this book had me laughing out loud at times, and if you leave it in the bathroom this book may prove to be a solid read.

Jon Stewart is good, too, but Colbert's satire has a sharper edge to it, cutting deeply and swiftly to the core of an issue, whereas Stewart is more of a blunt instrument, hammering away at his ideological opponents. Anyway, my point is that Stephen Colbert is quite possibly the most brilliant satirist of our time. So of course I enjoyed this book thoroughly. He addresses current political hot potatoes very effectively, all while snarking in the background about American exceptionalism, which has indeed gotten out of hand.It's hard to imagine anybody not liking this book, but I know full well that there are people who are completely immune to wisdom and insight, even when it's sneaked in, disguised as comedy. I think the only reason I'm giving this only four stars is that Colbert sometimes gets sillier than usual, which makes it easier for his critics to dismiss what he's saying. Really, this is more of a 4.5 rating. I wish GoodReads allowed for half-stars.
