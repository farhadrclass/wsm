The Last Thing She Ever Did  is a suspenseful, quick read filled with twists and turns. The characters are appalling, the story is over the top, and there's tons of drama--this combination makes for an addictive reading experience! \nBehind the closed doors of the beautiful facades of Bend, Oregon yuppie couples Liz and Owen Jarrett and Carole and David Franklin, ugliness lurks. When Liz commits an unthinkable act, their ugliness comes out in full force and their true natures are revealed. This is a fun, yet flawed read. Some elements didn\u2019t add up for me, but I\u2019m not going to get into that in this review. The characters are vile, but their behavior didn\u2019t bother me as it serves a purpose. This is a very readable book, but I found the ending disappointing. With such awful, outrageous characters, I was expecting more! Overall, I would still recommend for the entertainment factor.

This was my first experience with Gregg Olson and I can definitely see why many people like his style of writing :).Gregg Olson knows how to leave his readers on the edge of their seats! Can I just say... talk about a year of bad luck!! Yikes! Liz and Owen live in a small Oregon community by the Deschutes River. They are good friends with their neighbors David and Carole who appear to have it all with a sweet and charming little boy. One day, David and Carole's son Charlie disappears when he is playing outside by the river. Little did Liz know, this earth shattering event of Charlie disappearing will effect both couples in ways that the reader can't imagine. What truly happened to Charlie that day? What I liked about this novel? Very engaging! Gregg does a nice job with leaving his readers with wanting more from every page that is turned. Characterization was also pretty strong. Can, I just say both men were JERRRKKKSSS lol. What I didn't like so much? The ending.... I was extremely disappointed. I feel like a lot of the books I've been reading lately haven't had a strong ending. The author kind of leaves you hanging to use your imagination to figure out \"the last thing she ever did.\" The last chapter was weird.. to me it was conversation between characters and just completely stopped. I wanted a more solid and thrilling ending.Overall 3.25 stars on this one for me.Thank you so much to Thomas & Mercer and Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.Review published on Goodreads: 1/8/18.Publication date is 1/1/18."}, {"userName": "Sarah Joint", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19758811-sarah-joint", "userReview": "What a nerve-racking book! It made me feel for characters I thought I couldn't. A bit, anyway... as this book is full of characters that are difficult to like. Just when you think you've identified the worst character... oh, you're wrong. Bad decisions run rampant in this one. Suspenseful enough to keep your attention if slightly predictable. I know a lot of people won't be a fan of the ending... but even though it was jarring, I was okay with it. Liz and Owen are on their way to success. After a lot of hard work and long hours, he's about to experience a windfall... and no slouch herself, Liz is about to take the bar exam. No, it's not her first time... but hopefully this time she'll nail it. She doesn't know that the day of the exam will certainly change her life, but not in the way she hopes.If Liz and Owen are on their way to greatness, Carole and David have already arrived. She left her work at Google quite well off and now creates art, and he owns a successful restaurant in town. They have more money than most people would know what to do with. Carole now stays at home with her long-awaited young son Charlie. When she takes her eyes off him while he's playing by the river to speak on the phone, she expects him to be right where he was when she returns... her well-behaved, sweet boy. But he's gone.Most of the middle class long-standing residents of the neighborhood resent the rich newcomers who build large, block their views, and push them out, but the two couples are close. It's always seemed like a good thing, but when a tragic accident happens, they all may live to regret it. This book will horrify you at times but keep you reading.

I tried to keep an open mind as I read this book, but characters doing really stupid things, making really bad decisions, and compounding their lies drive me nuts!

I didn't like the split-second and life-altering decisions that were made. I didn't like such a simple premise.I read this in one sitting.I didn't look for any opportunity to do laundry or dust picture frames. I planted my backside on the sofa and with the exception of a few bathroom and coffee breaks, I read the whole thing. The writing is that good.Not only did I not connect with anyone, I didn't like them. There was one person that I was somewhat sympathetic towards until they opened their mouth later in the story.The split-second decision that was made, while wrong on so many levels, was believable. The author painted a situation where I could see it happening. Same for the life-altering decisions - I could totally see it happening IRL. In the hands of a lesser author, the decisions would come off as nothing more than stupid mistakes to keep the story moving.The simple premise kept the pages turning until there were no more. Again, excellent writing.The ending is what I have a problem with. What would I have preferred?

I mean crazy in a good way. I will warn you that there are some uncomfortable scenes in this book, so if you don\u2019t like gritty suspense novels, you might want to pass on this one. Charlie, a young boy, is out of his mother\u2019s sight for several minutes and vanishes. A neighbour and close friend to his mother knows what happens but coming forward will ruin their lives. Other than Charlie, all the characters were pretty much selfish jerks. Yet, I couldn\u2019t wait to see where the story would go and I was flipping through the pages. What I found interesting was the realism of the split decision moments, but wrestled with the how they reacted to. There was a twist to the ending, I for once didn\u2019t expect and while I am not sure if I liked the ending it was interesting. This novel had be glued till the end and that\u2019s what I love!

It\u2019s stuffed full of characters who each have this disgusting selfishness about them that makes my skin crawl. A little extreme you may say but it\u2019s my unshakeable reaction to this book sadly. The story (this happens at the beginning so no spoilers!) basically revolves around a woman who reversed over a 3 year old boy, hides the body and continues with her life. The boy as we subsequently find out, was still alive and could have been saved. It\u2019s just such an uncomfortable read and the whole story could have been avoided if the woman had just checked for a pulse? All of the characters are abhorrent, vile individuals that leaves you with a bitter taste.

I was probably a hot mess the entire time while reading it. I barely slept while reading this book because it was so freaking addicting! I just wanted to know everything! I couldn't wait! Plus, my mind was like \"WHAT IS SLEEP?!?\" \"DON'T KID YOURSELF! READ THE DAMN BOOK LADY!\". Yup, the book won this round and I'm not regretting anything.Okay, so this book is about two different couples, who are friends, and how their worlds are turned upside down by one important event. A kid is missing. This kid, name Charlie, is one of the couple's kids. Oh, the couples are: Liz and Owen & David and Carole. The moment Charlie is gone, I'm thinking.. what kind of parent let's their kid play by a damn river? Why weren't they watching him? Where did he go? WHAT HAPPENED TO CHARLIE?!Yeah, I had a ton of questions but I totally forgot about them while reading this book. WHY? Because it was so freaking good. Owen and David were dicks sometimes in this book and I didn't really like them for acting like that. Then there's the whole ending which I don't accept at all. I wanted more. I didn't want this book to end! Well, I did.. but with a better ending?!?Overall, The Last Thing She Ever Did was amazing. I loved everything about it. I'm sad it's over and I really want more.

A lot. Now, I easily preferred this to the 2 true crime books I've read by him, since both were edited terribly. No proper proofread. This is definitely WAY better presented which I was happy about. Plus I selected this as my Kindle First book for December and paid for it so I'm glad it wasn't a dud.He's created some.....interesting characters here. Of them all, I have to say the one I really despised was Owen. What a prize he is !! Actually, both the husbands are pretty terrible choices if you ask me ! The tale itself was very good and I read a third on the first evening and a further 50% on the second so it definitely holds the interest. There's not too much I can say other than that regarding the story without writing spoilers so I won't. A couple of characters were treated atrociously by the residents of Bend. Especially Dan....Liz too seemed to be a total flake.Now to these Google assistance-needed parts....I had to rely on it more than I would've liked. I know we share the same language but so many times you'd not think it at all. The Australian writers don't bastardise the language the way Americans do....I think it's very peculiar. A train rack over the toilet ?? We say starfish and I thought you did in America, too....nope-sea star !! I'd never heard of Calder (though, upon investigation, I can see I've not missed much) and this line just baffled me-\"The gray-and-white tabby's motor played against Liz's obvious anguish\"...plus the cat's called Bertie all the way through and it's only at 80% we're told it's a female ? Another female cat was named Toby...just peculiar. Amber glass beer growlers was another, I'd no idea Fedex ran printing shops nor what a Martha Washington geranium looked like !! Pilot Butte was called that all the way through and then suddenly he called it Pilot Knob ?? Google also showed me what a live-edge table looks like. I'd no idea what coup-countercoup injury was but Google pointed out it should be coup-contrecoup....There were some newspapers referred to which then went nowhere.....I expected them to get utilised. I wondered too how Liz managed to pick up a Thai takeaway first thing in the morning and why a McMuffin wouldn't suffice. The description high-desert was very overused. One character had pills that he shouldn't have and it was talked about but nobody asked him where they came from. So it's a case of flicking back a couple of pages believing I'd missed one or something, needing to re-read it.There were quite a few sentences that seemed to be either really bad or just a strange use of English....\"....she dreamed she was in the station wagon with her brother, Jimmy, in the neighbor's station wagon\" or \"She'd let Owen out of everything\"....and \"A gooseneck lamp illuminated the space in the far corner of the space.\"As for the police, I think they did a terrible job. It took them a whole week before they spoke to one witness holidaying in their little town and HE came forward to them !! Only an orderly in a hospital had seen something happen and they didn't even interview him. One character at the beginning had one child. Later on, his greedy relatives were alluded to and then, 90% in, Seth and his siblings merited a mention. So there was quite a bit of confusion with these continuity errors.Blimey, it sounds like it was non-stop mistakes but it wasn't, honestly. But do bear in mind I'm only a fellow reader, NOT a proofreader but this lot DID catch my attention....."}, {"userName": "Ella Star", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/74677804-ella-star", "userReview": "Beetles never stop.

I don\u2019t tend to get squeamish often but this one made me feel sick to my stomach all the while providing a compelling story and a satisfying conclusion I was sooo praying for.This book was honestly incredible and solidifies my belief that T&M thrillers are some of the best out there. This is my third one in a month or so and I just can\u2019t get enough.I loved the characters the author created, all of them so grey and murky, not black and white at all. He really made it impossible to put this book down and I HAD to keep reading to find out what actually happened. The first half of the book is absolutely INSANE in tension and has you stuck with your nose in a book. It was so shocking and oh so good.In many ways this book reminded me of Crime and Punishment. It was honestly such a good read and something I might pick up again in a year or so because it definitely left an impact.Would recommend for: If you love thrillers and you\u2019re not afraid of having your boundaries pushed, I strongly recommend this one!
