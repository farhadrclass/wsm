The fact that she is setting Gilly up with a goat just pisses me off, yuck yuck yuck. I'll bet you anything she will try and find a way to alter Puck's appearance to try and bring us back into caring but seriously just piss off. There is absolutely never been any chemistry between the two characters. I bet she tries oh so hard to make us like him more-he was abused too or he saves a village of orphan children-swoon. She stated that she is going to have a lot of William in this book, only to appease those who want William with another girl so that they buy this book anyway even though they hate Gilly so that she can still get her sales. Well for all those who wanted William with another I hope you get a character that you can't stand. A Puck character, so you know how we feel and I hope the book flops.

I have read and loved all of her other books/series as well. It pains me to say this, but I cannot support an author who just point blank leads her fans on with false advertising of a couple then decided at the last minute, of years of build up, to go in a different direction. Since book 3 of this series we have been teased with William and Gilly. In the past 10 or so books she has built up there chemistry and made promises of them being together. She even made them a shipname called Gilliam. I am so distraught over this because I have waited and longed for their book for years. I feel as if she only kept building up their relationship as a mean for book sales. She knew that William and Gilly are the fans favorite and that their book is the one fans have been anxiously waiting for. While I understand that it is her story and her characters, she can do what she wants, I don\u2019t understand why she lead us fans on for many years. I can recount every scene with William and Gilly and the chemistry between them. I don\u2019t understand why people want her with the goat. I keep seeing post about how creepy Williams relationship is with Gilly. How do they not find in creepy or awful that Puck, known as the goat to me, only saved Gilly to use her against William. Or worse, in Baden book after she married him, it was implied that she would have to make him feel something in order to eat. It was also implied that this would be of a sexual favor/bargained for food. Here is part of the scene, \u201cThose suggestions would be sexual, wouldn\u2019t they? The look in his eye...\u201d I would tell you the page but my kindle doesn\u2019t say what page exactly. Yet, William would never expect anything like this from her. Instead he cherished her and provided for her. Also, for the people that saying it was like a father/daughter relationship between her and William did not read the books. It was stated how William would look at her with lust in his eyes, and it was stated she loved him. Their relationship has been built up to be that as lovers. I\u2019m sorry but I lost respect for Gena as an author and a person. To use and deceive fans the way she did is not ok. If she didn\u2019t want these characters together, then she should of put a stopped to all the build up many books ago. She shouldn\u2019t of stated in interviews that William and Gilly would end up together either. It\u2019s just disappointing to see an author break this code of trust between her and the readers. With that said, I will no longer be reading anymore of her books/series. As much as I love the Everlife series and so badly want to read the last book, I can\u2019t support her anymore after this betrayal. For those of you who don\u2019t agree, that\u2019s fine you are entitled to your opinion. Just as I am entitled to mine and entitled to feel hurt and betrayed over this. It isn\u2019t so much as the character being together, it\u2019s the fact that she did lead us on for years and deceived us. That is what the fans are mad about. I don\u2019t like to be deceived by an author so that she can keep getting my money. I don\u2019t like the fact that I spent years anxiously waiting for this couple to have a book. I also don\u2019t like the fact that I wasted all this time reading her books just to get glimpses and closer to William and Gilly\u2019s book. With that said, I am once a loyal fan of hers turned heartbroken. Sorry for all the grammar mistakes, I\u2019m writing this from a shattered screen and in a hurry."}, {"userName": "\u25ca\u2666 Naomi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20128361-naomi", "userReview": "This book was a revelation. In my mind, Gillian belonged to William, I genuinely didn't believe otherwise, I respected Gena's decision but my mind was made up, until I read Gillian's story and it all made sense. If you feel the same way as me, if you feel like Gillian and William were meant to be, I feel your pain, I do. I understand how you must feel about this book too, maybe you don't want to read it, maybe you're done with the entire series and I respect that but, trust me when I say that if you give it a chance, The Darkest Warrior will change your mind, it will turn you upside down, it will make you cry and your heart will definitely break but then you will understand why Gena made the decision to find Gillian a new love interest. It does make sense.I even surprised myself. I was reading and then all of a sudden it clicked in my mind, just like that. I had gotten it. It was a revelation because before I started reading this book I felt a certain way about Gillian and William, I was sure nothing could make me think differently but then it happened, it was natural, it just made perfect sense. I am so glad I took a chance and read this book.No matter what you may feel, Gena is an incredibly talented writer and she knows her characters, she knows what's best for them, she knows their future and what life has in store for them. She wrote this book knowing a lot of readers were going to be angry, sad and feeling betrayed but she wrote it nonetheless because she knew she had to do the right thing for her characters even if it meant angering her readers and maybe losing some.But, honestly, from the bottom of my heart, if you love Gillian and William, please give this book a chance. As Martin Luther King Jr. once said,\n\"Take the first step. You don't have to see the whole staircase, just take the first step.\"\nI swear you won't be disappointed, you will understand, it will make sense, even if you still feel a little sad afterward at least you'll know the reason and you'll be able to move on. I loved this book. I loved it so much because it showed me that we, as readers, don't know everything, we don't get everything. Sometimes the author has something specific in mind for a character but she can't reveal anything so we feel betrayed at times, or angry but then the author just show us, it may take a little while, it may not be right away, but we eventually understand. The Darkest Warrior was it for me, I was confused and uncertain before diving in, my heart was with William and I didn't understand but then Gena showed me why Gillian and William didn't belong together, she made me understand simply by telling a story, a story I knew but never truly understood until now.I don't want to reveal too much so I will leave it at that: you will love and admire Puck, promise. William plays a big role in this book, you will see a lot of him and since his story is next, Gena is already setting it in motion and I am more than ready for it. Gillian, you will love and adore, she becomes so much more than the young frightened girl we all know her to be. Hades is badder than ever and I have a feeling we won't have to wait too long for his story as well. Rathbone makes appearances to my greatest delight, as well as the other seven kings of the underworld, you will want to eat them all up. Hopefully we will see more of them in The Darkest King. We also get to meet new demon-possessed warriors, Cameron and Winter, and it left me wondering, how many more books can Gena write in this series?! Not that I'm complaining, give them all to me!The Darkest Warrior will surprise you, it'll thrill you, it will also definitely make you bawl your eyes out. It's a bittersweet goodbye to a readers favorite couple, a loss you will be able to mourn while reading because Gena lets you have that. There's a quote that I love and I thought it was perfect to describe this book.\n\n\"Every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end.\"\n\nWilliam and Gillian not ending up together is not the end, far from it, it's only the beginning of an epic story, for both of them."}, {"userName": "Victoria Castillo", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49501590-victoria-castillo", "userReview": "Update: So you think a sketch is going to make this situation any better huh?

HOLD THE FUCK UP. Now I've been reading the Lords of the Underworld for years. Y-E-A-R-S. And never, in my wildest dreams have I ever thought I'd be let down this much by someone I admired. PLEASE TELL ME I'M DREAMING. (or that this is some marketing stunt and Ms.Showalter is going to turn around and be like 'gotcha!') I know I'm not the only one here who is disappointed in reading the synopsis of 'The Darkest Warrior'. Fans and myself alike have been anticipating for years on the Gilliam development. Now Showalter is up there with a huge fanbase comparable to other authors like JR Ward, Kresley Cole (to name a few) but please Ms. Showalter if you're reading this. I mean no disrespect to your creative agency or your ability to write. But I for one, and the majority of your fan base who truly love and enjoy your LOTU series will not recover from the blow if William and Gilly do not end up together. Here are the reasons why: 1. The buildup throughout the entire series of William and Gilly's romance. Denying us this is like, equivalent to cockblocking tens of thousands of people at once. 2. William's character was made for Gilly, and vice versa. William, the boyish, immature immortal with a mysterious and dark past is complimented and balanced by the fact that his love for Gilly adds not only depth but maturity to his character which we the readers, ABSOLUTELY LOVE. We love seeing how William acts with Gilly, you've been baiting us on their story for years now and this is quite possibly one of the biggest best-sellers you're going to have.3. Pairing Gilly up with Puck, who was originally a side character that was only introduced recently makes NO SENSE. This is an insult to the readers who have been anticipating the GILLIAM story, how can you suddenly pick up a main player like Gilly and suddenly pair her off with a side character like Puck? It's almost as though you're trying to sweep her under a rug and drop her off for the rest of the series (YEAH DON'T). I for one, will refuse to continue with LOTU if I don't see Gillian and William together. So although I respect your creative agency over all your works Ms.Showalter.

They complemented each other in a way no other couple in this series did. It wasn't only they slow burn that made things so much more interesing and gave depth to their characters, but their respective traits that made all so much better. Yes, she was immature and physically weak, in comparison to him. But that are both things that could have been treated in their book. Gilly had a heartbreaking backstory that could have made of that book an amazing, deep, emotional read. Relationship often aren't like math, in where two negatives make a positive. You need to have opposites to complement each other. That's why i haven enjoyed the last four books. All heroines lately had follow an specific mold. Arrogant, sarcastic, bitchy, inmature girls, who have a lot of physical power but nothing of emotional depth. With equaly emptied-head male counterparts. A lot of people in facebook seem to want another of that kind of heroine for William. They claim he need a \"strong woman\" who can keep with him toe to toe. And i say that's bullshit. Because what william needs is a women who can show him love and softness, to equate his own darkness and cruelty. Another Keeley, another Anya, another Katarina...that kind of woman could make a steamy book but not much more. There's a lot of different types of strength, not alwasy has to be the bitchy one. You can be tender, sweet and still be hella strong...in a world like this...in a world like LOTU, being soft is a synonimous of being brave. IMO. And Gilly being human doesn't meant she wasn't capable of stand against him. William himself said she was the only one capable of bear his dark moods and it has been stated many times through the series she never did what he wanted. Yes, she loved him. And yes, maybe that love hadn't develop yet because they never had the chance to go further...but their relationship never was brother/sister like.This book had the chance to be the one that rediemed the series for me. It could have been and emotional, heartwrenching, deep book, full of true love, acceptance, and redemption. Instead we got a mercenary goat who we barely know and whom i personally don't GAF about. Many people say i should give this book, and Gena, a chance. But you know what? I already gave Gena a chance, multiple chances actually, and she screw them all. I won't be reading this book, because i couldn't stand reading about one of my favorite characters of all times, being reduced to a means for an end. Much less if she is ending up with a fucking Goat.Cali out...Can't comprehend why some people were so butt-hurted about Gilly being much younger than William but then when she was paired up with a satyr suddenly nobody remembers that she is still young, just turned eighteen, still traumatized, and Puck is probably as old as William, or at least quite old too.

You must be the Red Queen I\u2019ve heard so much about.\u201d\u201cYou may call me Dr. Keeley.\u201d We are going to be fast friends, and I am going to teach you how to torment William of the Dark for years to come.\u201cDo I not deserve a greeting, poppet?\u201d William purred.Gilly\u2014Gillian\u2014turned with a grace rivaling a ballet dancer and placed her hands on her hips. \u201cAre you the person who burned all of my party decorations to ash?\u201d\u201cI am.\u201d And he didn\u2019t sound sorry about it.\u201cThen no. You don\u2019t deserve a greeting.\u201d ====================================Excerpt from Gena Showalter\u2019s Darkest TouchThough William couldn\u2019t seem to tear his gaze away from Gillian. It was almost embarrassing.The womanizer\u2014former?\u2014stroked his finger over his fork as if he were imagining stroking something else.Okay. It was definitely embarrassing. There was such intense heat in his eyes that even looking at him made her feel scorched by the sun.===========================Excerpt from Gena Showalter\u2019s Darkest Torment\u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d William said. \u201cYou\u2019re not. In fact, my life makes yours look like a picnic hosted by naked forest nymphs.\u201d\u201cNow you\u2019re exaggerating.\u201d\u201cUnder-exaggerating, perhaps. In a matter of days, Gillian will celebrate her eighteenth birthday.\u201d\u201cSo?\u201d Baden wanted the guy to say the words aloud\u2014to admit to a vulnerability of his own. Tit for tat. \u201cShe\u2019ll be an adult. Old enough to handle you.\u201d He couldn\u2019t help but add, \u201cOr any other man she wants.\u201d\u201cMe,\u201d William snapped. He\u2019d never been able to mask the intensity of his emotions for the girl. \u201cOld enough to handle me. Only me. But I can\u2019t have her.\u201dWhen the guy said no more, Baden prodded him. \u201cBecause you\u2019re cursed?\u201dA pause. A stiff nod. \u201cThe woman who wins me will kill me.\u201dLoTU don't deserve Gilly and the significance of what she represents. If there's a deserving couple in LoTU series that can give a soulful example of LOVE it SHOULD BE Gilliam- they could have prove about relationships that's beyond sexual, a healing between two wounded individuals that thought they are beyond repair. Of love that is unconditional they'd rather sacrifice their selves to protect one another. I hope you are happy with your choice, Gena Showalter. I hope you will never utter the word \"REGRET\" about breaking the couple that could have give you the \"greatest love story ever written\" under your belt.So long LoTU and any of your works, Gena Showalter. You'll forever be a part of my broken heart and trust issues.

I don't even know how to express my disgust/rage/disappointment/nausea over this mess. I'll try my hardest. Okay. So. We get teased for 11 books - 11 FREAKING BOOKS - about Gilly and William. Their relationship was teased beautifully. It was the one unique and best slow building relationship in this series. For God's sake, I've stuck with it for 11 books! I can't even stick with my 1 hour episode of tv without getting bored and jumping ship. All of this patience and emotional investment amounts to nothing because Gena (you backstabbing shady ass....) randomly decides that Gilly should end up with....a goat man who has been in, what, one book? NO ONE CARES ABOUT HIM!! This is the most shady move I have ever seen a writer make. And to the people saying that it was obvious that Gilly and William weren't going to end up together...huh?? With quotes like this from a mere two books ago, it's very easy to see why we feel led on:\"When William isn\u2019t on a violent rampage about his daughter\u2019s death, he\u2019s watching Gilly with such intense hunger everyone else wants to pluck out his eyes, then their own.\"When Gilly enters a room this is William's reaction. \"No longer the picture of relaxed depravity, he morphed into a bona fide pillager\u2014ready to spring and attack...to devour. Keeley had never, ever, witnessed such a response from him.\"\"William couldn\u2019t seem to tear his gaze away from Gillian. It was almost embarrassing. The womanizer\u2014former?\u2014stroked his finger over his fork as if he were imagining stroking something else....There was such intense heat in his eyes that even looking at him made her feel scorched by the sun.\"WTF. Complete effin tease. I guess Gena recently posted on her FB about how sorry she is to have disappointed her readers and how she intends to regain trust. I'm sorry, there's no regaining trust after that. Gena's writing and character building has declined in the past several books to the point that I was only buying her books to keep up with William and Gilly. No more. If I could, I'd return every book I'd purchased from her and spend the money on a worthy author. Buh bye Gena.P.S. - She can take the sketch of William in this book and shove it up her condescending behind. Yes Gena, a sketch of what should have been the hero of the story, will definitely make us feel better. Shouldn't she be promoting Puck anyway??
