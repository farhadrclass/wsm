After three weeks of opening its pages virtually every night, I now find myself saddened that I can no longer turn to it. How can anything else compare? Of Human Bondage is a classic in every positive sense of the word. Aside from The Brothers Karamazov, it is the only book I've read, whereupon finishing, I was able to say to myself: \"This novel is life itself: it contains all of its complexities, emotions, and meaning. Everything that you need to know about life is in this book. All that is life, is this.\"The main character, Philip Carrey, (who was born with a clubfoot and a taciturn temperment), is a different sort of lad; yet he manages to be understandable and human. He is intelligent and introspective, has a strong passion for the arts and adventure -- and, though he's rather introverted, even hardheaded at times -- means well and would do just about anything for his fellow human being. Being inside Philip's head and watching the ramifications of his decisions as he grows into a man, is at times harrowing; other times, vitalizing: it conjures up many emotions: the reader receives a full and enriching experience of a life truly lived.Maugham's wikipedia page is slightly critical of his writing, stating that he\u2019s lost critical acclaim as a great author, and that few modern-day writers count him as an influence. This is sad, and upon reading it, I was both astounded and appalled, because the prose in this novel is exquisite. I was constantly swept off my feet by Maugham's ability to display the wretched and beautiful in smoothly written, truthful ways. \"But he could not tell what that significance was. It was like a message which it was very important for him to receive, but it was given him in an unknown tongue, and he could not understand. He was always seeking for a meaning in life, and here it seemed to him that a meaning was offered; but it was obscure and vague. He was profoundly troubled. He saw what looked like the truth as by flashes of lightning on a dark, stormy night you might see a mountain range. He seemed to see that a man need not leave his life to chance, but that his will was powerful; he seemed to see that self-control might be as passionate and as active as the surrender to passion; he seemed to see that the inward life might be as manifold, as varied, as rich with experience, as the life of one who conquered realms and explored unknown lands.\"This novel had its affect on me for many different reasons, but two personal, empirical reasons quickly come to mind. One is that having had problems myself, for a period of time, due to a physical deformity of sorts, I was able to relate to Philip's embarrasment and resentment of his clubfoot, and how it affected his personality and his dealings with others. I remember thinking to myself, \"How does Maugham express these emotions so perfectly? He must have had a similar experience himself.\" And sure enough, I later found through wikipedia (heh) that Maugham had a very serious stuttering problem that made him a bit of an outcast.The other personal, empirical reason is that for a period of time, while in college, I fell hard for a girl that had no interest in me whatsoever. I lied to myself that she liked me, I kept treating her wonderfully, and held onto \u2013 and practically lived upon -- her every word. Pathetic, really: very pathetic. Philip went through this -- more drastically, and with a much colder woman than was my college crush -- but still, it brought back memories and emotions: I could empathize: I could relate. (In fact, on a number of occasions as Philip was dealing with this, I found myself gritting my teeth and wincing.) Philip Carrey is one of only a few literary characters that I know will stay with me ten years from now; he is imprinted within me. With all of Philip's difficult experiences (and the manifold of deep emotions felt therein), Of Human Bondage is the perfect novel with relation to self discovery and growing up. In addtion, it has all the existentialism, philosophical inquiry, and ideas of a great Dostoevsky novel. The way I felt about this book can, in part, be articulated from something Philip himself said:\"Partly for pleasure, because it's a habit and I'm just as uncomfortable if I don't read as if I don't smoke, and partly to know myself. When I read a book I seem to read it with my eyes only, but now and then I come across a passage, perhaps only a phrase, which has a meaning for ME, and it becomes part of me; I've got out of the book all that's any use to me, and I can't get anything more if I read it a dozen times. You see, it seems to me, one's like a closed bud, and most of what one reads and does has no effect at all; but there are certain things that have a peculiar significance for one, and they open a petal; and the petals open one by one; and at last the flower is there.\"I realize that in this quote Philip was speaking of specific parts of books; how certain passages and ideas stick with him over time; that they can reveal parts of himself and, in conjunction with other passages from other books, slowly unfold what life to him truly means. But you see, I feel slightly differently than Philip about this: I believe that there are individual novels out there that, when taken as a whole, can provide the reader with an overall truth about life that goes far beyond any collection of passages from various reads. These novels are so rare and special, and their affect so profound, that one is lucky to come across a few of them in the course of an entire life. And this, my friends, to me, was one of those novels."}, {"userName": "JSou", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1020084-jsou", "userReview": "THIS BOOK IS ABOUT A GUY WITH A CLUBFOOT HIS GIRLFRIENDS A BITCH"}, {"userName": "Trevor", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/175635-trevor", "userReview": "A lot of this book is quite harrowing \u2013 you know the drill, young boy orphaned and alone in the world and being brought up by people without affection. Public school nightmares, a child with a deformity that causes him shame all his life.I was not surprised to learn that Maugham was homosexual, or bisexual, or trisexual \u2013 or whatever it was that he was. There are subtle hints to the fact throughout the book. Young Philip, the central character (rather than protagonist, I think \u2013 as there is something of the antagonist about him too) fascinated me. His loss of faith, for example, happens so simply that it had a real ring of truth about it \u2013 much of the book is autobiographical and this seemed particularly so here \u2013 well, to me anyway. This was not always the case. There were things that happened in the book where I struggled with the suddenness of his \u2018discoveries\u2019 \u2013 where Philip finally determines the meaning of life from a Persian carpet, for example \u2013 the meaning being pretty much Nietzschean pointlessness relieved by recognising life as a work of art \u2013 seemed a little sudden for me. I tend not to have such revelational moments in my life, but I guess I should not deny them to others.His furious passion and ardent love for Mildred \u2013 a slut and callous bitch if there ever was one \u2013 is all a bit much. But if the definition of a good novel is how often it gets one to call out, \u201cNo Philip, not that!\u201d then this is a great novel. Again, I\u2019ve been lucky in that I\u2019ve never loved someone completely in the way Philip does \u2013 not in a way that is insensible to how terribly they have treated me and how completely indifferent they are to me. So, perhaps, in this too, I am lesser than Philip.Maugham defined himself as \u2018among the first of the second rate\u2019 \u2013 Philip goes off to study painting in Paris and leaves when he realises he will never be more than mediocre as a painter \u2013 and the life of penury that being a painter would necessitate could hardly be justified if he was only ever going to be second rate. The question \u2013 what is art and how does one know one has the gift \u2013 is a constant theme of the early part of the book.The conclusion is hard to say \u2013 there is much talk in the book that reminds me of Wordsworth, the artist shows the world how to see and how to feel. But there is also a terrible pointlessness to art. In the end I think art isn\u2019t what one does because what is produced is good or bad, it is what one does because there is no other choice. And for most of us there are always other choices.Repeatedly, as someone is about to die, Philip is struck by how pointless their lives have been. In the end Philip is grateful for his acceptance of the meaninglessness of his existence \u2013 which reminds me of that quote from Stendhal, \u201cGod\u2019s only excuse is that he does not exist.\u201d There is a terribly interesting scene towards the end of the novel where this is brought home with full power. It is a favourite ploy of the faithful to think that atheists on their death beds convert to join in hope of salvation. While his uncle is dying, and Philip has been sitting contemplating murdering the old man to relieve his own intolerable poverty, he knows the old man is almost panic stricken at the idea of losing his life. This resolves differently to how I expected \u2013 leaving room for the faithful to celebrate at the comfort their faith offers in the end \u2013 but it seems a somewhat hollow victory when their own saviour\u2019s last words were \u2013 \u201cOh Father, Father, why hast thou forsaken me?\u201dThe central idea of this book is that life has no meaning \u2013 no overarching meaning \u2013 that most of life is pain and bitterness and at times punctuated by tiny moments of joy and happiness \u2013 and these ought to be accepted and celebrated equally \u2013 both the pain and the joy \u2013 as part of the tapestry of life. Love is almost impossible and is never equal \u2013 it is a sad and bitter vision.In the end the real lesson seems to be to live in the present. I would have liked to have read this book years ago, I\u2019m terribly sorry I have only read it now for the first time \u2013 I would have liked to have read it when I was 18, when I would have had no means to understand it. I would have liked to have had it with me during darker times than this. It was quite a read and I enjoyed it, if enjoyed is at all the right word, very much."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/604477-kelly", "userReview": "Has one of literature's great lines about reading: \"Insensibly he formed the most delightful habit in the world, the habit of reading: he did not know that thus he was providing himself with a refuge from all the distress of life; he did not know either that he was creating for himself an unreal world which would make the real world of every day a source of bitter disappointment.\""}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32532774-lisa", "userReview": "I love the main character in this book so much, I was sad to say a final goodbye to him after spending 700 perfect pages with him. \"Of Human Bondage\" is now among my favourite books of all times, inspiring so many reflections that my copy of the book is full of scrap paper with quotes and references.Somerset Maugham explains in his introduction that he felt compelled to write down this story as it was tormenting his memory, in order to free himself from the ghosts of the past. It is not strictly autobiographical, but reflects on his experience. As a successful playwright, he must have been well acquainted with the theatrical device of catharsis in the Aristotelian sense of the word, and in a way, the character of Philip Carey might have eased the author's pain and relieved him from his struggles with himself. But Philip Carey is NOT just a imaginative portrait of a specific person, he is the very essence of a questioning, searching human being, experimenting with life and its meaning.Even if Philip comes to the conclusion in the end that life has no meaning, this is not to be taken as defeat. In fact, it gives him the uttermost freedom to create his own life pattern, choosing form and colour freely and according to mood and circumstances. After Philip broke off his art studies in Paris, someone told him that those two years were \"a waste of time\", and Philip answered something to the effect of: \"Not at all, for I have learned to see the shadow of that tree branch on the grass and the blue sky. I wouldn't have been able to see my environment without those experiences!\" I find so much wisdom in that attitude. Learning to see the world more fully, and with pleasure, can never be a waste of time, just because it does not lead to a professional development. Reading \"Of Human Bondage\" does not help me professionally, but it makes me feel more alive.The eternal drama of desire and disappointment in love reminded me of Sartre's conception of Hell, where all characters are bound by unreciprocated desire. Somerset Maugham's outlook is somewhat less depressing, though, as life goes on and new possibilities open up all the time. In fact, the reader leaves Philip at the moment when he finally decides to get married, and anyone who has embarked on the adventure of marriage knows that the story does not end there. Somerset Maugham could easily have filled another 700 pages on Philip's accumulated experience during the first ten years of marriage and possible fatherhood, not to mention old age. I would not have wanted a sequel to this story under any circumstances, as it is perfectly complete such as it is, but the message clearly is: life goes on, it has no objective meaning, but you are in charge of creating the pattern you prefer:\"Whatever happened to him now would be more motive to add to the complexity of the pattern, and when the end approached he would rejoice in its completion. It would be a work of art, and it would be none the less beautiful because he alone knew of its existence, and with his death it would at once cease to be.Philip was happy.\"This idea of life as a work of art, meaningless but beautiful, reminds me of Oscar Wilde, a contemporary of this novel. \"All Art Is Quite Useless\", he said, in full praise of the only thing that exists without any practical reason, solely for the pleasure of wit and beauty.Must-read! Love it!"}, {"userName": "Joe Valdez", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez", "userReview": "The best novel I've read that wrestles with the meaning of life was once The Razor's Edge by W. Somerset Maugham. That honor now belongs to Of Human Bondage, written by Maugham thirty-nine years earlier. This voluminous, passionate epic of ideas and expectations concerns one Philip Carey, born with a club foot in London in the 1880s as he journeys into adulthood, encumbering relationships and suspending them, searching for his calling and his own answer to the question posed by so many 20th century artists, but few as eloquently as Maugham. What Is Life?Philip is introduced as a child in 1885. His father, a surgeon with a good practice, died unexpectedly of blood poisoning. He's survived by a pregnant wife in fragile health and a son, Philip. A poor manager of money, Mrs. Carey encounters more misfortune when she delivers a stillborn son and passes away. Philip's paternal uncle William, vicar of Blackstable, arrives to take custody of his nephew, raising him sixty miles from London with his wife, Louisa. The childless couple are all thumbs when it comes to parenting. The vicar is a thrifty, obtuse man while his wife suffers quietly under his lack of affection, but raise their nephew as if he was their own.Raised in the vicarage, where he bathes no more than once per week in a tub near the kitchen boiler, in the same manner his uncle, aunt and their maid Mary Ann do on opposite days of the week, Philip has few peers his own age, and grows into the solitary, often lonely life of an only child. Forbidden from playing games on Sundays and brought to tears over being assigned the memorization of collects from the prayer book, Philip is handed an illustrated book his aunt sneaks from her husband's study. A lifelong passion for books begins.One day a good fortune befell him, for he hit upon Lane's translation of The Thousand Nights and a Night. He was captured first by the illustrations, and then he began to read, to start with, the stories that dealt with magic, and then the others; and those he liked he read again and again. He could think of nothing else. He forgot the life about him. He had to be called two or three times before he would come to his dinner. Insensibly he formed the most delightful habit in the world, the habit of reading: he did not know that thus he was providing himself with a refuge from all the distress of life; he did not know either that he was creating for himself an unreal world which would make the real world of the every day a source of bitter disappointment. Presently he began to read other things. His brain was precocious. His uncle and aunt, seeing that he occupied himself and neither worried nor made a noise, ceased to trouble themselves about him. Mr. Carey had so many books that he did not know them, and as he read little he forgot the odd lots he had bought at one time and another because they were cheap. Haphazard among the sermons and homilies, the travels, the lives of the Saints, the Fathers, the histories of the church, were old-fashioned novels; and these Philip at last discovered. He chose them by their titles, and the first he read was The Lancashire Witches, and then he read The Admirable Crichton, and then many more. Whenever he started a book with two solitary travelers riding along the brink of a desperate ravine he knew he was safe.At the age of nine, Philip is sent to King's School at Tercanbury, where the neighboring clergy send their sons for their primary education. His club foot rules him out of sports and is often made a target of ridicule among the other boys, but even after his deformity is accepted and ignored, it remains a source of sensitivity for him. Accepting everything he reads, Philip believes the Bible and becomes a devout boy. Assured by his uncle and others that the power of faith can move mountains, Philip prays for God to give him a normal foot. The lack of results leads Philip to question for the first time what he's read or been told.Philip develops a cutting sense of humor and is ultimately befriended by a boy named Rose whose attention flatters Philip and before leading to jealousy. When Rose abandons Philip for a new best friend, Philip loses all interest in school or sours on a scholarship to Oxford. He announces his desire to study in Germany and resisting all attempts by adults to sway Philip to finish one thing before he starts another, the boy eventually gets his wish. A friend of his aunt's recommends a boarding house in Heidelberg run by a professor. In Heidelberg, free to rise and study at his leisure, Philip learns some German, a bit of French but is mostly schooled by the personalities of the boarders he meets. An Englishman named Hayward is son of a county judge; a lover of literature and Roman Catholicism, he's an idealist, and recommends many books to his new acolyte, which Philip devours. An American philosophy student named Weeks sees Hayward less as a poet and more of a waster, and with deliberate self-assurance, calls the Englishman out on his inconsistencies during their fireside chats. Philip continues his education.One of the things that Philip had heard definitely stated was the the unbeliever was a wicked and vicious man; but Weeks, though he believed in hardly anything that Philip believed, led a life of Christian purity. Philip had received little kindness in his life, and he was touched by the American's desire to help him: once when a cold kept him in bed for three days, Weeks nursed him like a mother. there was neither vice nor wickedness in him, but only sincerity and loving-kindness. It was evidently possible to be virtuous and unbelieving.Returning to Blackstable after three months, Philip meets Miss Wilkinson, daughter of his uncle's last rector, whose exact age becomes a frustrating riddle to the boy as he becomes taken with her. Having worked as a governess in Berlin and Paris, Miss Wilkinson thrills Philip with her tales of being seduced by an art student in the City of Lights. Philip sets his mind to seducing the older woman. As for his future, Philip sits on a meager fortune of only two thousand pounds, and eager to go to London, it is recommended by the family lawyer that Philip apprentice as a chartered accountant. Philip greets loneliness in London and what at that time, seems like misery. Socializing with few people other than his fellow clerks, he's bored to death by the work. He begins making sketches on company stationary to pass the time and while a career in accounting begins to look dim, he's compelled by Hayward to devote his life to the only two things that matter: love and art. The idea grabs hold of Philip and when his apprenticeship at the accounting firm expires, he bucks the expectations of his uncle and with some financial assistance from his aunt, is off on his next great adventure: studying art in Paris. As in his last foreign experience, Philip falls in immediately with his fellow students in Paris. He grows close with a conceited, disagreeable art student named Fanny Price. Philip finds her paintings atrocious and her hygiene nearly as bad, while her poorly communicated affections for him grow. Philip wonders whether he has what it takes to be a successful artist and falls under the spell of a penniless drunk and writer named Cronshaw who the art students tell knew all the greats. Cronshaw tells Philip where he can find the answers to all his questions.\"Have you ever been to the Cluny, the museum? There you will see Persian carpets of the most exquisite hue and of a pattern the beautiful intricacy of which delights and amazes the eye. In them you will see the mystery and the sensual beauty of the East, the roses of Hafiz and the wine-cup of Omar; but presently you will see more. You were asking just now what was the meaning of life. Go and look at those Persian carpets, and one of these days the answer will come to you.\"\"You are cryptic,\" said Philip.\"I am drunk,\" answered Cronshaw.W. Somerset Maugham saw Of Human Bondage published in 1915, but if fleeting mention of year was redacted within the novel, it would be impossible to determine whether his story takes place in 1900, 1950 or 2000. The book is completely devoid of trends, fashions or popular culture and is more passionate, witty and vivacious for it. Edith Wharton is one of my favorite authors, but even with her I feel claustrophobia of the early 20th century, as if squeezed inside an hour glass and being smothered. Maugham transcends era. He could be writing about characters and conversations taking place at the corner coffeehouse. His wisdom is nearly as impressive as his language.It is a mixed lot which enters upon the medical profession, and naturally there are some who are lazy and reckless. They think it is an easy life, idle away a couple of years; and then, because their funds come to an end or because angry parents refuse any longer to support them, drift away from the hospital. Others find the examinations too hard for them; one failure after another robs them of their nerve; and, panic-stricken, they forget as soon as they come into the forbidding buildings of the Conjoint Board the knowledge which before they had so pat. They remain year after year, objects of good-humoured scorn to younger men: some of them crawl through the examination of the Apothecaries' Hall; others become non-qualified assistants, a precarious position in which they are at the mercy of their employer; their lot is poverty, drunkenness, and Heaven only knows their end.Of Human Bondage is a thick novel, but a thrilling one. Maugham is a storyteller, first and foremost. He introduces one of the great villains of literature in Mildred Rogers, an ice queen Philip becomes inexplicably enamored with in London and is nearly destroyed by in a manner I found too familar. Likewise the charismatic friends who come and go, the aunt who loves more than is loved, the dead end job, the family member on their death bed, I recognized from my own life. Maugham takes the reader on a search for the meaning of life but does so without peddling hokey sermons. Instead, before there were even such a thing as documentaries, he structures the novel like one, focusing on a boy as he moves through childhood and into adulthood. There are many stops along the way and times I expected the novel to settle down, kick up its feet and explore one relationship, or one travelogue, all the way through. Instead, the story moves on, just like a life."}, {"userName": "Jenn(ifer)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/780933-jenn-ifer", "userReview": "The following is American Idol judge Nicki Minaj's critique of Of Human BondageHello darling.

On the other hand, there are also books one should have read 20 years earlier. For me personally, \u2018Of Human Bondage\u2019 belongs to the latter category. It had been gathering dust on my father\u2019s bookshelf for years (in German translation) and I never thought about it. To tell you the truth, this book crossed my path again because of \u2018The Goldfinch\u2019, an impressive Pulitzer-winning Bildungsroman and one of my favorite books. I was looking for another Bildungsroman when I came across \u2018Of Human Bondage\u2019 again. \u2018Of Human Bondage\u2019 by Somerset W. Maugham is a classical Bildungsroman \u2013 a coming of age story, published almost 100 years ago. While reading it, I continually had to remind myself that the book is actually 100 years old. A lot of Philip\u2019s thoughts seemed so very modern to me that I often forgot when Maugham actually wrote them. This is the story of Philip Carey, who loses his parents in early childhood. As a reader, we witness his life from early childhood until his thirties. Even though it is a third person omniscient narrative, the reader is very deeply involved in Philip\u2019s thoughts. I read a large part of the book over the Easter holidays and was so deeply immersed in the story that Philip became almost real for me. This happens to me very rarely with a book. It is that childlike state when you forget everything around you and reality and fiction merge into one. Of course, as in every good Bildungsroman Philip spends most of the book struggling with life\u2019s challenges. More than once I wanted to take him under my motherly wing as he attempted to deal with religious beliefs, hindrances and, especially, relationships with women. Philip is an aesthete and a lover of literature. His love for books, literature and art comes across throughout the book and adds to the quality of storytelling:\u201cAnd then beautiful things grow rich with the emotion that they have aroused in succeeding generations. That is why old things are more beautiful than modern. The \u201cOde on a Grecian Urn\u201d is more lovely now than when it was written, because for a hundred years lovers have read it and the sick at heart take comfort in its lines.\u201d(p.281)Maugham\u2019s rich descriptions of paintings and art in general are especially evident when his protagonist reflects on El Greco\u2019s paintings. El Greco\u2019s artwork used to make me feel rather uncomfortable and I was not a fan of his gloomy brushstrokes, but through Philip\u2019s reflections Maugham opened my eyes.\u201cEl Greco was the painter of the soul; and these gentlemen, wan and wasted, not by exhaustion but by restraint, with their tortured minds, seem to walk unaware of the beauty of the world; for their eyes look only in their hearts, and they are dazzled by the glory of the unseen. No painter has shown more pitilessly that the world is but a place of passage. The souls of the men he painted speak their strange longings through their eyes; their senses are miraculously acute, not for sounds and odours and colour, but for the very subtle sensations of the soul. The noble walks with the monkish heart within him, and his eyes see things which saints in their cells see too, and he is unastounded. His lips are not lips that smile.\u201d (p.397)El Greco,1595: Study of a ManThe reader accompanies Philip on his stays in Heidelberg, London and especially Paris where he enrolls in art school, convinced of his abilities as a painter. I particularly enjoyed this part of the book, when Maugham gives the reader a fascinating insight into the bohemian lifestyle of the Belle \u00c9poque. Paris and its smell, colors, people and lifestyles come alive before the reader\u2019s eyes.\u2018Of Human Bondage\u2019 is said to be Maugham\u2019s semi-biographical novel and I would recommend every reader to look up the writer\u2019s life before or while reading the book. With this in mind, I was especially astonished by Philip\u2019s relationships with women. Philip is in pursuit of beauty, but not when it comes to women. Women are either anemic, have narrow pale lips, greenish skin (!) and are flat-chested like a boy, or they are large and unsophisticated. Not very attractive, I would say. By comparison, Griffith, one of Philip\u2019s fellow students, is described as a \u201ctall fellow, with a quantity of curly red hair and blue eyes, a white skin, and a very red mouth\u201dand Maugham writes that \"There was a peculiar charm in his manner, a mingling of gravity and kindliness which was infinitely attractive\u201d. Maybe I am biased, knowing that Maugham\u2019s sexual preference was for men rather than women, but I wonder if the reader of 90 years ago picked up these hints. That said, Philip\u2019s relationship with Mildred (best known for its film adaption with Bette Davies in 1934), a vulgar, unworldly teashop girl he encounters during his medicine studies in London, tops everything. It is almost unbearable to read how he submits to her, how he let himself be humiliated by her. \"He did not care if she was heartless, vicious and vulgar, stupid and grasping, he loved her. He would rather have misery with one than happiness with the other.\u201d(p.308). Every time Mildred appeared in the story, my stomach literally twisted in knots. I must admit that even though these scenes are an important part of the plot and constitute the main storyline in the aforementioned film adaptation, I found it very hard to endure them. However, they are an essential part of Philip\u2019s personal development. Philip is a complex character. Born with a clubfoot, he always felt self-conscious. He is shy and overly sensitive. He blushes a lot (I counted 30 times). Nevertheless, he endures humiliation with a stoic steadiness. In the meantime he is often condescending. He is aware of his intellectual superiority to Mildred. As a connoisseur of literature and art, he even feels superior to his peers at Medical School. Notwithstanding his flaws, I like Philip very much. In real life as well as in literature I have a soft spot for people who are in pursuit of beautiful things, who love literature and art. Philip is a keen observer of human behavior, both that of his entourage and his own. His train of thought, his self-exploration and subsequent conclusions on religion, philosophy and the meaning of life come easily and straightforwardly to the reader. In my opinion this is Maugham\u2019s forte: the examination of ideas in moral terms and his portrayal of the meaning of life and religion through Philip\u2019s eyes. The writing style is rather simple; nothing remains of the flowery or verbose prose of the Victorians (which I love by the way!). Nonetheless, the writing is powerful; it has stayed with me long after I have finished the book.As I have already said, I wish I had read \u2018Of Human Bondage\u2019 20 years earlier. It is certainly a book to encourage younger people to find their place in life. But even 20 years \u2018too late\u2019, the book has the power to evoke a variety of strong emotions. Why is this? Maugham provides an answer through Philip: \"When I read a book I seem to read it with my eyes only, but now and then I come across a passage, perhaps only a phrase, which has a meaning for me, and it becomes part of me...\u201d (p.292)\u2018Of Human Bondage\u2019 did this to me."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7668522-carol", "userReview": "What is the meaning of life? Well, the answer seems to be hidden in a scrap of Persian rug.This is the story of an unforgettable fictional \"character\" named Philip Carey and his extremely tumultuous and tormented life from age 9 thru 30.Poor Philip is only nine years of age when his beloved mother dies in childbirth and he is sent off to the vicarage to live with his strict, overbearing Uncle William and loving Aunt Louisa. Born with a club-foot and small for his age, Philip is shy and embarrassed by his deformity and is often lonely and pegged an outcast.In his search for freedom and affection, OF HUMAN BONDAGE descriptively depicts Philip's various vocations, friendships, precarious love life and education.....as well as his love of books.\n\"Insensibly he formed the most delightful habit in the world, the habit of reading: he did not know that thus he was providing himself with a refuge from all the distress of life; he did not know either that he was creating for himself an unreal world which would make the real world of every day a source of bitter disappointment.\"\nThroughout the reading of this complex semi-autobiographical novel, I often became so frustrated with Philip that I just wanted to shake his obsession with the vile, grungy waitress Mildred right out of him!

Maugham is a good story teller and his characters are drawn well. It is a story of obsession, desire and yearning for something beyond the ordinary run of life. The hero, Philip Carey is not a conventional hero; he has a difficult childhood, a club foot which deeply affects him, he's awkward and often uncomfortable with people. We follow Philip from childhood, the death of his parents, living with his very religious aunt and uncle, boarding school, his attempts at jobs, Paris trying to be an artist, studying medicine, poverty and back to medicine. Interspersed are friendships, relationships with women and especially the intense and doomed relationship with Mildred which dominates the second half of the book. The 1934 film had Bette Davis as Mildred; wonderful piece of casting. There is a slightly awkward ending which I found satisfying and unsatisfying at the same time.So why did the book strike a chord with me? Mainly because I identified so much with Philip Carey. I wasn't orphaned, but there was the intensely religious upbringing. Then, more importantly, there was Philip's club foot which blighted his school days; children are cruel; I have a disability which affects the way I walk (I stand out) and made school grim hell. Philip used reading to escape; as I did and many others do. Our career paths were different, apart from a period of unemployment; but there was a realisation that ultimately the negativity could either destroy one, or it could be turned to positivity and empathy for the pain and suffering of others. Philip survives and becomes stronger. Of course, Philip also falls in love with or becomes involved with totally inappropriate women; not, of course that I've ever done that (Ha!).There is a redemptive theme running through, although Philip loses his religious beliefs. This is a powerful novel and is well worth the effort."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "MISOGYNE BONDAGEFirst from Maugham's Self-Loathing, Chauvinistic ClosetBefore discussing the title, my thoughts on this superb 1915 novel:Reading it was a strain, slow-moving until the protagonist Philip Carey went to Paris to study art, after which I found it fascinating, then infuriating and ultimately affirming. That is to say, I loved the parts about art and Paris and his relationship with Fanny Price, the poor and talentless soul who committed suicide; I detested his main love interest (a unilateral infatuation of the first degree) in Mildred Rogers, the Cockney waitress who used and abused him without pity, and his pathetic lapses into co-dependency on her. Thus, I was heartened by Philip's ability to finally escape the chains of fear and self-hatred caused by losing his parents young, having a clubfoot and being attached by \"love\" to an awful leach.Now, to misogyne bondage:The enterprise of comparing this novel with his other three major novels, The Painted Veil, The Moon and Sixpence and The Razor's Edge, as well as his most acclaimed short story, \"Rain,\" has been terribly illuminating. As I contemplated, I saw a peculiar pattern in Maugham's female leads (in these works, at least) and was reminded of an essay by Christopher Hitchens that I read in his brilliant collection Arguably: Selected Essays, in which Hitchens reviewed the Maugham biography Somerset Maugham: A Life, by Jeffrey Meyers. See C. Hitchens, \"W. Somerset Maugham: Poor Old Willie,\" The Atlantic, May 2004. After re-reading this essay and traveling back through my memory of the four novels and short story, I am convinced that Maugham was a misogynist sparked by his self-loathing as a closeted homosexual.Consider first, \u201cMaugham worked assiduously to create a persona for himself in life. And the life was, according to this admirable biography, a good deal more exquisite, dramatic, torrid, and tragic than any of the works. Born and brought up in France, Maugham lost his parents when quite young and from then on was farmed out to mean relatives and cruel, monastic boarding schools. The traditional ration of bullying, beating, and buggery seems to have been unusually effective in his case, leaving him with a frightful lifelong speech impediment and a staunch commitment to homosexuality.\u201d ***\u201cAn ideal way to \u201clock in\u201d homosexual disposition is probably to spend time as a gynecologist in a slum district of London\u2014which, astonishingly enough, is what the fastidious young man did. Though he would ultimately abandon medicine, he passed considerable time delivering babies in the abysmal squalor of Lambeth, on the south bank of the River Thames. As part of his training he witnessed cesarean births in the hospital, where death was not uncommon.\u201d  C. Hitchens, \"Poor Old Willie,\" supra.Reviewing each of his four major novels and his most renowned short story, one is struck by the common thread: the females are all weak, wanton and/or wicked. These women are the type of which George Bernard Shaw so mordantly quipped in his play, \"Mrs. Warren's Profession\": \"She may be a good sort but she is a bad lot.\"Mildred Rogers and Fanny Price (who only appeared briefly) from the instant novel are discussed above. In the short story, \"Rain\" (1921), the prostitute Sadie Thompson is violated by a missionary intent upon saving her soul and after finding the missionary dead from suicide, the narrator observes that Sadie has returned to \"the flaunting quean\" they had first known when coming to American Samoa. \"Quean\" means \"a low woman; a wench; a slut.\"In The Razor's Edge (1944), Sophie Macdonald, a childhood friend of the protagonist Larry Darrell, becomes an alcoholic, opium addicted \"slut\" after losing her husband and child to a tragic car accident. On the eve of the wedding of Larry and Sophie (whom he's trying to save from a life of debauchery), Larry's pre-war girlfriend, the wealthy, wicked Isabel (who wants Larry for herself), leads a sober, fragile Sophie back to the path of destruction by effectively handing her a bottle of expensive vodka.In The Moon and Sixpence (1919), Blanche Stroeve, wife of a Dutch painter who is a friendly comrade of the Gaugin-based antihero, abandons her husband for \"Gaugin,\" who quickly casts her aside once she's served her purpose as a model and short-term concubine, after which she kills herself.Finally, in The Painted Veil (1925), Kitty Garstin Fane, the heroine, is a flighty and self-centered \"low woman\" who, shortly after marrying Dr. Fane, embarks upon a lurid, torrid affair lasting two years and only laughs when initially faced with Dr. Fane finding out. Notably, this is my favorite Maugham novel, probably because he gives Kitty redemption. While this may seem the exception to my thesis, I'd point out that Kitty is like the others in her sexual promiscuity, a trait that seems particularly deplorable to misogynists.Does this take away from the brilliance of Maugham's works or mean that he doesn't remain on my list of favorite authors? No. But, I do believe that being forced by then-existing societal norms to hide his homosexuality significantly contributed to his self-loathing, in turn leading to his negative outlook toward women. Were our culture more advanced, as it is now progressing, maybe Maugham would not have felt compelled to conceal his sexual preference and would not have been so fundamentally adverse to females and, as a consequence, might have been more kind to the superior sex (IMHO) and penned novels with more positive female characters or at least given his seriously damaged female characters more redeeming arcs, such as he did in The Painted Veil.I don't do this for a living so I cannot afford to spend any more time revising or cleaning up this review, so please forgive any errors or if I have offended anyone."}, {"userName": "Mariel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel", "userReview": "Of Human Bondage used to be under my (re)tired \"waiting-until-I'm-not-too-depressed\" shelf on goodreads (it had no company. What's the time before birth? I'm gonna say purgatory anyway). Yeah, right. Jump, Mariel, jump! I'm glad it is out of the way. It's the uncomfortable conversations like religious people might feel if they are unstable in faith. The glimpses when someone points out to you a fact (weeeelll) about yourself that pulls off every straggled hair as it is yanked off. I started reading Of Human Bondage after getting dumped by my friend of many years (I'm \"too dark\"). All things considering, a stupid book choice on my part, if I didn't want to be reminded of these exact type of conversations. Of Human Bondage is a before the dust settles life part story of Phillip. I'd say it is not much a life story as a whole lot of those conversations that look big and mean a lot of things, and at the same time sound big to beat you down. Like when Phillip wonders if thinking ever helped anyone out when they needed it? Backstory! Subtext! Okay, here's some text: My friend told me I waste my life reading books. Fiction is pointless. Those conversations might have SOME point. They aren't the whole point. That gets in the way of living, when those ideas beat down. I don't want to be beaten down. God, I really don't. What was it that M. Ward said about if life is short then why are the nights so long? Paragraph break. My eyes would glaze over that much of me babbling. Phillip comes to the realization that life has no meaning. Everyone dies. If you can't be great, why bother? Okay, so stories are not real. But what the hell is? Is love real? Imagined, built up, analyzed interactions. Memories don't match. Life then gets rewritten in that hindsight. I comfort myself that nothing I do matters. It's how I can bully myself to carry on despite my intense stupidity. I don't understand much and sometimes this is really painful. (I say this a lot because it is my recurring nightmare.) So what? That's not gonna change. Stories are where it's surprise and multi sided relationships all in one's own brain. The best part? A surprising brain of your own. Of Human Bondage makes me feel my \"But that's all wrong!\" and crying out in frustration and misunderstanding when confronted with those beat down conversations. That it isn't forever is how I can carry on. What it means to me, and it doesn't matter if I can give back anything worth as much... Yeah, stories. To be honest? I was a little lost when the ideals were really entitlement. Wrong foot... I hated Phillip sometimes. I related to Phillip too much sometimes too. He's a quitter like me. His life's work was all along his introspection. His pitying and self satisfied (mostly in pity) inner life. How could he have missed that he only wanted Mildred because she had rejected him? C'mon, Phillip, even I would have seen that. The side of Phillip that thinks more about how good he could look making love instead of just making love... Frustrating, indeed. Mildred is too pathetic for me to hate. She's just drifting between thoughtless passions. I'd hate her if I had it in me to hate people who picked on me in junior high. I'm needing more than that these days... Mildred is the void that is no stories. Yet she remembers everything about her dreams... Pretty much the only interesting thing about her. It isn't like he didn't KNOW that. She's not even an adult. How could one ever have a relationship with her? Or expect to? Phillip's ideal was someone beautiful. (Sorry to anyone who hasn't read Lanark! [If you haven't, it's really good.] This relationship made me feel exactly like that. So what? It is your own damned fault.) I'm not inclined to feel that bad for a guy who doesn't try to take a bit more than that looks thing. (Sally reminded me of Mildred with the \"If you like\" and passiveness, anyway. If she despised Phillip she'd be better off with him. That creeps me out.) Take more! If you can't know how anyone else feels anyway, if you're going to be trapped in your own head... Make that space richer? Miss Price killed me. Starvation suicide... Phillip's disgust towards her, his impatience with her affection... I mean, he's the same to these other women like Miss Price and Norah that Mildred was to him. Why his Mildred is a bitch talk and poor me didn't get what I deserved? What the hell is deserved? Sometimes I worry that I'm like a sociopath who cannot fake human emotions when it comes to romance and religion. I just couldn't feel sorry for Phillip when it came to his \"ideals\" (coughs entitlement coughs) of perfect beauty. (By that token, he didn't \"deserve\" love because of his club foot.) It isn't about who deserves what. You take what the hell you can get if you can, I say. I don't know what it is like to lose that because I never had it. Entitlement. I don't want to stop caring. Sad sigh. I felt a lot of things from this book... I just wish they were the sustaining kind that I'd drink from in my camel's hunch back huddled up for sanctuary. I said this already... It's that \"But you're wrong! You HAVE to be wrong!\" conversation interlude outside of life that almost sounds like it is getting somewhere and probably really isn't. I know what I can't live without... I marked off so many passages for future reference. I will probably look them over in the future when I miss having someone to piss me off with being wrong that my life in my head from books is meaningless. Life outside too. There were many jumping off points for inspiration. I'm going to have frames of reference. I guess that's what Phillip had from his own life of introspection. He's too much like me and I don't like me. My favorite part of Of Human Bondage is when young Phillip gets into the picture books. He stares and imagines and goes to places. I can get that retreat. It was the sensitive like feeling attuned instead of his quick to offense that I relate to entirely too much (on my worst days). Phillip's sweet moments when he feels sensitive. Maybe he likes himself for being sensitive. I don't care about that. I like looking beyond that shitty layers and can feel embarrassed, pained... He's at best when no one wants anything from him. Knowing what to do is really hard. Phillip would be a really good friend to have if he were in a book... And not the parts that were me. P.s. Damn. Why'd I have to write a review of this before bed time? I'm upset."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "I had no idea what Of Human Bondage was about going in. I'd heard vague, unreliable rumors and I expected a dense, difficult read, perhaps a philosophical mind-bender or hell, by the title and date of its publication (1914) I wouldn't have been terribly surprised if it turned out to be a naughty Victorian era S&M novel (Can you imagine all those naked ankles? Forsooth!)It's just a coming of age tale. I'm not even sure \"tale\" is the appropriate term considering how very autobiographical this book turns out to be. It's not loosely based on W. Somerset Maugham's life, it is his life. Sure, the details are changed or rearranged a bit, such as giving his main character Philip a clubfoot instead of the stammer he actually had or having the character be a struggling painter instead of the struggling writer Maugham was, but in the end this is Maugham's early life. The story starts at the beginning of Philip's life and ends when he's in his thirties. Much of the first half describes his school days and youthful experiences abroad. The later half focuses mainly upon an infatuation in which he allows himself to be used time and again by a woman who has no love for him. So pathetic did he become in my eyes during this section that I had a hard time stomaching it. His intense love for an undeserving woman tested the believability waters a time or two in my eyes, but I'd heard of how middle and upper class Englishmen of that time often developed fancies for poor shop girls, so I was able to hang in there. I have a feeling not everyone else would have that same kind of stamina. I'm not boasting, it's just down to taste and patience for certain kinds of, I don't know, let's call it entertainment. The rumor of potential philosophizing was true to a point. There was plenty of the sort expected from college students who major in the arts, and who think art is the most important thing in life...nay, more important than life itself! Many a high-minded declaration of this nature is made through out the middle section of this book. Certainly there are insights, but there are just as many follies. But for all its philosophizing, Of Human Bondage is just about a guy trying to figure out who he is and what he believes in. It asks with a cyclical repetition \"who am I?\" while simultaneously stating \"This is who I am.\" Philip doesn't know the true answer or the meaning of the answer he gives. Half time you wonder if he understands the meaning of the question. And perhaps that's the point. What is the meaning of life, and what does that question really mean?"}, {"userName": "Rowena", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2990642-rowena", "userReview": "This was my first Maugham book and I'm very glad I was recommended it. The story was essentially the coming of age story of an orphaned boy who was born with a clubfoot.He tries to find himself in many different ways and places; in Germany, in Paris, in London etc. I loved the parts of the novel which dealt with the Bohemian lifestyle in Paris. It was basically the stereotypical image one gets when imagining poor, struggling, artists. The characters I met in this section were among my favourites in the whole book. The book deals with many issues, for example loss of faith, youth trying to discover their destiny, love (Phillip's love for the cruel and selfish Mildred was very obsessive, moreso than I expected), lost dreams, philosophy etc. I quite liked the protagonist, Phillip.

Friendship and love, that we find in the very society we often dislike for its ill elements, are the only motivations and comforts besides our beloved ones to help us survive. Bonding, be in friendship or love, is how we find the people we want to be with and attach ourselves to them. Like all men, Philip was born into this world where he wondered why he was born in first place, brought up in a family from which he often wanted to disassociate, and caught up in love affairs in which he hated himself for being helplessly captivated. To him, bonding seemed to be inevitable and reading seemed to be safe haven. As Goethe said, Bonding is like chemical reaction. We do not always end up with a desired result, as it may explode on our faces leaving us with permanent scars. Sometimes, it left him feeling loved, and at other times, feeling wretched.\u201cHe knew that all things human are transitory and therefore that it must cease one day or another. He looked forward to that day with eager longing. Love was like a parasite in his heart, nourishing a hateful existence on his life's blood; it absorbed his existence so intensely that he could take pleasure in nothing else.\u201dLike all men, Philip was ridiculed because of his natural weakness: clubfoot. He tried to find someone who would see him for not what he has, but what he is. No matter how hard he tried and how nice he was, Clubfoot was still there in his body and nakedly visible to others\u2019 eyes. Sometimes, \u2018leaving\u2019 where he was supposed to be \u2018living\u2019 was all that he could do.Like all men, Philip wanted to have his own freedom to think and act freely and that made him go to Germany and Paris (correspondingly). Arts and literature solaced him but did not make him feel home. Soon, he knew that he did not belong there. His pursuits of meaning for life, most of the time, turned out only to be meaningless, but he believed that he had to discover the meaning on his own.\u201cLike all weak men he laid an exaggerated stress on not changing one's mind.\u201d Like all men, Philip was stubborn about his decisions which, sooner, he was likely to give up. In the scurry of passing love and fair-weather friendship, he limped through his way to what his father was. But it was not at all easy for him to withstand the winter of loveless days. The new lives he helped to emerge into newborns offered a professional satisfaction. Living became a little easier, his deformity became a forgotten object, and he might be as well loved, too. But,\u201cThe important thing was to love rather than to be loved.\u201d ---This is how the life of Philip was, which people often relate to the life of Maugham, and that is not undebatable.

Somerset Maugham at the time, a work that is part of a long and distinguished line of such whose origin is in Germany which that debut training appeared in the eighteenth century.Philip is an orphan and lives in the presbytery with his uncle reverend and his aunt remained childless; life is very austere. He is sent to a religious boarding school where he learns the maliciousness of his schoolfellows that attracts his clubfoot, school friendships very ephemeral, stifling conformism, prejudice and servitude that teachers demand as a tribute to their authority. A gifted and intelligent pupil, he refused, however, to pursue his studies at Oxford, which would open him the career of a pastor whom their tutors call for. It is to see the world he wants and to live his life. Thus he went to Germany in a pension in Heidelberg, an important place in his intellectual and ethical formation. He realized, astonished, that he no longer believed in God. Returning to England, he experienced his first emotions in love, and embarked on the fray in London, where he rapidly deceived, his place as an apprentice in an accounting firm, and the isolation of the suburbs. Feeling artistic disposition, it was in Paris, in spite of the reluctance of his uncle, that he went to study painting. It is in a city with a creativity and artistic attractiveness that it happens: Paris lives at the time of the innovations of the impressionists, Philip feels transported there: finally the great life, the freedom of the rapins, it thinks of being able to make its place. The encounters that he makes there complete his education, he will gain freedom of mind, but must resign himself to the evidence: he will not be a painter. He resolved to follow the paternal example and returned to London to study medicine. Then he madly falls in love with a tea-room waitress of a rather vulgar conformism who has no use for him, this complex attraction made of contempt and sensual attraction, a passion without hope whose impetuous impulses are not rewarded only by vilest ignominy, is another aspect of these enslavements of which he must make the bitter experience. Haphazard placements make him swing and compel him to endure the yoke of a stunning and uninteresting job: calico for a magazine of novelties. But a happy and healthy friendship is offered to him: a man at first jovial and pleasant commerce within his large family will bring him the comfort of the family that he hardly had and finally love.The simple joys quickly forgotten, the gradual loss of innocence to enthusiasms force too quickly cooled, bitter disappointments, the discovery of the discrepancy between the ideal and reality, the will to give a rule of life and meaning to the latter for to perceive that all is vanity, these are some of the obligatory and painful steps by which Philip must pass to arrive at his full maturity. This novel with a strong autobiographical content, proposes beautiful pages on art and painting, notably concerning Le Greco; I especially appreciated the painting he made there of the bohemian Paris, the licentious and hard life of apprentices painters. Of Human Bondage is a true classic in the noble sense of the term: beautiful, hard, exciting, we plunge in eagerly to emerge moved and somewhere transformed."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "\u201cLife seemed an inextricable confusion.

(p.350)What beautifully flawed and frustrated characters Maugham created in Of Human Bondage! This book pulled me in quickly and I loved walking alongside Philip Carey, a boy born with a clubfoot and orphaned at a young age, as he struggled into adulthood. Every character in this story, whether a major player or a minor one, is so real and raw -- they are all alive and despicable in their own authentic ways.Philip is sent to live with his religious and conservative uncle and aunt, he struggles to find a sense of self and fumbles through school being bullied and confused.  It is an illusion that youth is happy, an illusion of those who have lost it (p.109). His uncle and aunt are painted in such vivid sadness, Philip watches them and learns to want more out of life.  Philip realised that they had done with life, these two quiet little people: they belonged to a past generation, and they were waiting there patiently, rather stupidly, for death; and he, in his vigour and his youth, thirsting for excitement and adventure, was appalled at the waste. They had done nothing, and when they went it would be just as if they had never been.(p.118)To say he is in a constant state of identity crisis is an understatement. He goes from being an assistant at an accounting firm, to being an artist in Paris, to being homeless and starving in London, to being a doctor.... as someone who still contemplates what she wants to be when she grows up, I related to Philip's inability to find his place in the world. His sense of never belonging, of never being good enough resonates throughout his life.When he falls in love, he does so terribly. Mildred is a character who is so ugly and chaotic, so hateful and mean, that I looked forward to her appearances throughout the book. Unrequited love is a constant theme - Norah loves Phillip but Phillip loves Mildred but Mildred hates Phillip and loves Griffiths who hates Mildred. It's a wonderful web of tragedy of which Philip is unable to escape.  He had though of love as a rapture which seized one so that all the world seemed spring-like, he had looked forward to an ecstatic happiness; but this was not happiness; it was a hunger of the soul, it was a painful yearning, it was a bitter anguish, he had never known before\" (p.253)The on-again-off-again of Mildred and Philip is frustrating. She treats him like an ATM and he takes it. She's a wretched woman I loved to hate, and apparently so did Philip. He hated, despised, and loved her. (p.274)This book is exquisite. Beautifully written and wonderfully alive. It was no surprise to learn after the fact that this book is almost entirely autobiographical. Maugham's mother died at a young age and he was sent to live with a religious uncle, just as Philip was. He was teased in school for a speech impediment, as Philip was teased for his clubfoot. Maugham had homosexual inclinations and so many times in this book there are minor acquaintances and crushes that Philip has on males - though it's subtle. The insight in which Maugham is able to portray with Philip is astounding - the shame, the lack of self worth, the confusion. Philip learns, as we all eventually must, to live in the present and to appreciate life. To take pleasure in the small things, to find purpose in the people you love and the people who love you back. This book is dark. It's lonely. It's painful. It's absolutely amazing."}, {"userName": "Martine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/381149-martine", "userReview": "Of Human Bondage is a Bildungsroman which frequently makes you groan and mentally exclaim 'Oh, no!', only to blow you away with the power of its message and the perfection of its ending. Over the course of the 656-page book, the main character, Philip Carey, a young orphan born with a clubfoot, takes many wrong turns, mostly because he has taken it into his head that he wants to live the life of a romantic hero. He makes unwise career moves, recklessly spends money he should have saved, and gets obsessed with a woman who is so obviously awful that even he himself, at the height of his passion, calls her an 'ill-mannered slut'. But such is the depth of his obsession and extravagant generosity that he goes on treating her nicely even when she grossly abuses him, because hey, you never know -- she might realise one day that he's a much nicer fellow than the rakes with whom she likes to hang out. And so he drags himself down into a hell of masochistic misery, very nearly ruining himself in the process, only to find that happiness of a kind he had never given any serious thought is within his grasp, if only he cares to accept it and let go of the false dreams and ideals that he has cherished for years. The most autobiographical of all Somerset Maugham's novels, Of Human Bondage is a frequently maddening but always impressive account of the education of a shy, bullied young man who seeks to free himself from the shackles of existence without realising what exactly these shackles are. Following a strict and unhappy upbringing, Philip goes on to look for freedom, romance and adventures in the world of art, ideas and ideals, not realising how dangerous and seductive these are, and how they will lead him astray. For much of the first half of the book, Philip is a somewhat unlikeable, self-pitying snob whose bad decisions and obsessive love for an obviously horrible woman occasionally exasperate the reader. In the final third, though, he learns important lessons and meets genuine friends, and by the end of the book he has improved so much that you really find yourself rooting for him, hoping he'll recognise the goodness of the life and wife that are placed before him, and accept them. Maugham paints his journey towards awareness in exquisite detail, looking deep into Philip's soul but also sharing the outsider's perspective on him. He also does a great job drawing the large cast of secondary characters. Many of them are vain, selfish and pretentious, but that only adds to the 'Oh, no!' quality of the story. As for the book's message, which is that life has no meaning and that it's better to accept this before one drives oneself mad searching for it, this is brought home in magnificent detail, especially in the superb final third of the book, which has more depth than just about any other novel I've read. Granted, the story is a bit long, and the first half drags a bit, but it's worth sticking with it for the final chapters, which are so cathartic and revelatory that you cannot but come away impressed and converted. I know I did. Twice. I'd give the book 4.5 stars if I could, but alas..."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "[And when he was faced to endure the madness of going from a life of prestige to one of stark poverty, I applauded his courage even as he watched his dreams lapse temporarily.

Of Human Bondage was written in 1915 following a philosophical theme that William Somerset Maugham was developing during his first novel. It is Maugham's semi-autobiographical novel.Philip Carey, born with a physically deformed foot, is orphaned at a very young age. He is raised in the house of his stoic, rigid, unyielding preacher uncle whom he grows to resent. As an intelligent and educated young adult, he is harshly disappointed by his unsuccessful attempt to become an artist. Floundering, he eventually settles on a medical career, where his compassion and capacity to ease his patients' suffering seem natural, inborn. He meets an ill mannered waitress, Mildred Rogers, and falls in love. They are, from the start, undeniably unsuited - completely incompatible to one another. Their obsessive and irrational, back and forth relationship is based on Maugham's developed philosophy of \"human bondage\" and the novel's central theme of love and passion. Maugham postulated in his book (he refused to call it an autobiography or a book of recollections) The Summing Up:\"I believed we were wretched puppets at the mercy of a ruthless fate; and that, bound by the inexorable laws of nature, we were doomed to take part in the ceaseless struggle for existence with nothing to look forward to but inevitable defeat. I learnt that men were moved by egoism, that love was only the dirty trick nature played on us to achieve the continuation of the species, and I decided that, whatever aims men set themselves, they were deluded, for it was impossible for them to aim at anything but their own selfish pleasures.\"(The Summing Up, p.73)Maugham's philosophy questioned the nature of human actions and their underlying motivations: If someone's choice of action is based on his rational will, yet he is controlled by his very nature to act differently, then rational will is not autonomous nor free. He is in psychological bondage.The natural instincts of Maugham's characters are persistently scourged by unrelenting passion. Fanny Price, for example, the failed artist who needily attaches herself to Philip in Paris, is in a kind of bondage to the passion to paint. Her desire is deep rooted and overwhelming. Disregarding time and again her instructors' humiliating assessments of her lack of skill, she is driven to frantic levels and eventual self destruction.Mildred is described as \"anemic\", a woman not even generically attractive, a consideration which makes Philip's infatuation of her the more odd. She is stupid and common - her passions are essentially primal; she's more easily drawn to men who are as manipulative and undependable as herself. For a caring, concerned, vulnerable and likable man like Philip, whom she describes often as a \"real gentleman\", she could barely tolerate. She is, to some degree, also in bondage to her own passions.Philip's personal binds are obvious, beginning with his early comprehension of his physical restrictions - the origins of the barrier to his psychological freedom. Philip looses faith in the religion which proclaims freedom of prerogative; he realizes he hasn't the skill to follow his desire to paint; he obsessively loves Mildred in spite of her loathsome conduct and her inability to love him back; he suffers dire poverty when finding work is impeded by his club foot. Until Philip finds power over his constraining desires, his progression as the novel's protagonist remain stymied.Maugham clearly made his point with Philip and Mildred's relationship, although too often, too repetitively. Philip seemed to fall into the same trap over and over again, without learning from his past bad experiences with this she-devil. Many times I shouted at him and wanted to shake him (gently, of course) from sheer exasperation. Of Human Bondage is a wonderful read, be prepared to holler at Philip but don't miss out on the basic human lessons. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "DNF at 25%.

My knowledge of W. Somerset Maugham\u2019s work was limited \u2013 I had seen the 2006 film version of The Painted Veil but never read anything by him \u2013 so I had no clear idea of what to expect. I was pleased to encounter a narrative rich with psychological insight and traces of the Victorian novel.Philip Carey is not unlike a Dickensian hero: born with a club foot and orphaned as a child, he\u2019s raised by his stern vicar uncle in Kent and reluctantly attends boarding school. Much of the book is filled with his post-schooling wanderings and professional shilly-shallying, along with multiple romantic missteps. He studies in Germany, tries to make it as a painter in Paris, and returns to London to train as an accountant and then as a doctor. Each attempted career seems to fail, as does every relationship. Philip reminded me most of David Copperfield, especially after he meets the jolly, Micawber-esque Thorpe Athelny during his hospital internship and becomes friendly with his wife and children.As is common in Victorian novels, Philip is troubled by his conflicting desires. When it comes to women, he cannot get love to match up with lust. As a youth he loses his virginity to Emily Wilkinson, a woman in her mid-30s, then wants nothing to do with her. A few other dalliances have mixed success, but the novel focuses on Philip\u2019s connection to Mildred Rogers. A caf\u00e9 waitress, she\u2019s vain and ill-tempered and acts indifferent to Philip \u2013 but is happy for him to spend money on her. He\u2019s disgusted and infatuated all at once: \u201cHe did not care if she was heartless, vicious and vulgar, stupid and grasping, he loved her. He would rather have misery with [her] than happiness with [another].\u201d Though Mildred tries to eschew the traditional roles of wife and mother, the Victorian notion of the fallen woman haunts her.This on-again, off-again romance forms the heart of the book. Both Philip and Mildred are maddening in their own way. Not since Pip (another Philip, interestingly) in Great Expectations have I been so furious at a main character for consistently making the wrong choices, being dazzled by beauty and status and ignoring the more important things in life. Yet the close third-person narration sees so deeply into Philip\u2019s psyche that I could not help but feel sympathy for him, too, cringing over his every failure \u2013 especially when stock market losses leave him destitute and he undertakes humiliating (to him) work at a department store. The novel is liberally studded with intimate paragraphs conveying Philip\u2019s thoughts:He painted with the brain, and he could not help knowing that the only painting worth anything was done with the heart. \u2026 [H]e had a terrible fear that he would never be more than second-rate. Was it worth while for that to give up one\u2019s youth, and the gaiety of life, and the manifold chances of being?Pain and disease and unhappiness weighed down the scale so heavily. What did it all mean? He thought of his own life, the high hopes with which he had entered upon it, the limitations which his body forced upon him, his friendlessness, and the lack of affection which had surrounded his youth. He did not know that he had ever done anything but what seemed best to do, and what a cropper he had come! Other men, with no more advantages than he, succeeded, and others again, with many more, failed. It seemed pure chance. The rain fell alike upon the just and upon the unjust, and for nothing was there a why and a wherefore.Another humanizing element that especially appealed to me was Philip\u2019s loss of Christian faith. During my study abroad year and especially my master\u2019s year at Leeds, when I wrote a dissertation on women\u2019s loss-of-faith narratives in Victorian fiction, I read a lot of novels about belief and doubt. In Philip\u2019s case, I was interested to see how Maugham portrays what is usually seen as a loss as more of a liberation:Suddenly he realised that he had lost also that burden of responsibility which made every action of his life a matter of urgent consequence. He could breathe more freely in a lighter air. He was responsible only to himself for the things he did. Freedom! He was his own master at last. From old habit, unconsciously he thanked God that he no longer believed in Him.Although Philip frequently indulges in self-pity, he also has moments where he wakes up to the wonder of life. These epiphanies of the beauty of London, of the whole world, were among my favorite scenes.Unusually in a long book, I thought the last 150 pages were the strongest. I struggled to pay attention throughout Philip\u2019s schooling and wearied of the endless negotiations with Mildred, but when Philip is at his lowest point \u2013 like the protagonist of Knut Hamsun\u2019s Hunger, not even sure if he\u2019ll find enough to eat \u2013 there\u2019s a real intensity to the plot that made this last chunk fly by.I read a 1930s Modern Library copy from the University of Reading, but consulted Robert Calder\u2019s introduction to the 1992 Penguin Classics edition for background information. It seems the novel was recognizably autobiographical for Maugham, though where a club foot was Philip\u2019s source of shame, for the author it was his stammer (and his sexuality \u2013 he married but is known to have been a homosexual).Like Joyce\u2019s roughly contemporary A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Calder notes, Of Human Bondage fits into the \u201capprentice novel\u201d genre. Despite being published in 1915, it is set in a recent past so makes no reference to the First World War, though the Boer War plays a background role. I didn\u2019t find the book to be particularly dated; I even discovered that a couple of sayings I might have pegged as later inventions were around in the 1910s: \u201clike it or lump it\u201d and \u201cput that in your pipe and smoke it.\u201dOf Human Bondage met with a lukewarm critical response in its own time but does seem to be among the more beloved \u2013 if obscure \u2013 classics nowadays. Calder insists that it \u201cremains Maugham\u2019s most complete statement of the importance of physical and spiritual liberty.\u201dThere have been three film versions \u2013 and another is in production this year, apparently. The best known, from 1934, launched the career of Bette Davis, who gave it her all as Mildred Rogers (she was a write-in favorite for the Oscars that year). Overacting, for sure, but her blonde wave and simpering looks were perfect for the role. By contrast, Leslie Howard\u2019s is a fairly subtle Philip. The movie \u2013 condensed, amazingly, to just over an hour and a half \u2013 focuses on his club foot and his relationship with Mildred; I was disappointed that no attempt was made to reproduce Philip\u2019s introspective monologues through voiceovers.To my surprise, Calder asserts that Of Human Bondage \u201chas become one of the most widely read of modern novels, particularly by young people, who still find relevance in Philip\u2019s struggle for a free and meaningful life.\u201d It was good enough for Holden Caulfield, after all. It struck me during my reading that two recent novels may have taken inspiration from Maugham: the main character in Esther Freud\u2019s Mr. Mac and Me, set in 1914, has a club foot; and in Hanya Yanagihara\u2019s A Little Life Jude\u2019s shame over his deteriorating physical condition, especially his legs, is reminiscent of Philip\u2019s.I\u2019m not sure I\u2019ll try anything else by Maugham \u2013 how could I when there\u2019s still so much of Dickens and Hardy left to read? \u2013 but I\u2019m certainly glad I read this. It\u2019s clear why Berthoud and Elderkin thought Of Human Bondage would be a perfect read for someone in their 30s: it\u2019s infused with the protagonist\u2019s nostalgia for his youth and regret at opportunities not taken and time lost.

It was like dishing out the toy at the bottom of the cereal box:He accepted the deformity which had made life so hard for him; he knew that it had warped his character, but now he saw also that by reason of it he had acquired that power of introspection which had given him so much delight. Without it he would never have had his keen appreciation of beauty, his passion for art and literature, and his interest in the varied spectacle of life. The ridicule and the contempt which had so often been heaped upon him had turned his mind inward and called forth those flowers which he felt would never lose their fragrance.

N\u00e3o raros s\u00e3o os leitores que lhe atribuem nota m\u00e1xima, figurando mesmo em algumas listas de melhores obras ou de c\u00e2nones cl\u00e1ssicos. Aceitando a relev\u00e2ncia e compreendendo o efeito que o livro produz, tenho no entanto algumas obje\u00e7\u00f5es a apontar, nada que fa\u00e7a desmerecer o destaque da obra, s\u00e3o mais quest\u00f5es que o texto evocou em mim e partilho para reflex\u00e3o. (Estas minhas obje\u00e7\u00f5es acabariam por, no decorrer da produ\u00e7\u00e3o desta resenha, transformar-se em reconhecimento pela obra de Maugham).[Acabei por ter de comprar a vers\u00e3o eBook da Asa, j\u00e1 que a edi\u00e7\u00e3o em papel que tinha \u2014 cole\u00e7\u00e3o Mil Folhas do P\u00fablico \u2014 apresenta um tamanho de letra completamente ileg\u00edvel. Estamos a falar de uma edi\u00e7\u00e3o que consegue colocar em 540 p\u00e1ginas o que as edi\u00e7\u00f5es normais colocam em 700.]Come\u00e7o pelo tom, j\u00e1 que ele \u00e9 talvez um dos maiores catalisadores do impacto no sentimento dos leitores. Maugham, aqui o personagem Philip, apresenta-se na primeira pessoa, relatando a sua vida desde crian\u00e7a at\u00e9 \u00e0 idade adulta, abrindo o seu cora\u00e7\u00e3o a n\u00f3s com total franqueza, mas acima de tudo explanando toda a sua vida por meio de um filtro de grande humildade. E se os eventos e as personagens s\u00e3o vistas pelos olhos humildes de Philip, que s\u00f3 v\u00ea pelo lado certo da moral, sem julgamento dos outros, apelando \u00e0 raz\u00e3o para desculpar o erro e a maldade, a escrita de Maugham, simples, sem floreados ou recursos estil\u00edsticos, ainda que notando-se o labor de depura\u00e7\u00e3o da mesma, contribui em muito para que esse sentimento de franqueza e humildade impregne toda a nossa experi\u00eancia de leitura.Este tom n\u00e3o \u00e9 alheio ao facto de \u201cServid\u00e3o humana\u201d ser um romance autobiogr\u00e1fico, ainda que nem tudo corresponda exatamente \u00e0 realidade, mas na generalidade \u00e9 um relato de uma vida. Maugham n\u00e3o tinha um p\u00e9 boto mas gaguejava, e mais importante, os seus pais morreram quando ele era crian\u00e7a, tendo ido viver com o seu tio, tal como Philip. Maugham n\u00e3o foi para Paris para se tornar artista da pintura como Philip, mas tornou-se artista da escrita, o que ajuda a explicar as d\u00favidas que pairam sobre Philip durante todas as suas tentativas de se tornar um artista de primeira, e n\u00e3o um mero pintor mediano. Quanto \u00e0 Fran\u00e7a, nasceu na embaixada inglesa em Paris, esteve na primeira grande guerra mundial em Fran\u00e7a ao servi\u00e7o da Cruz Vermelha, e voltaria in\u00fameras vezes a Fran\u00e7a onde acabaria por morrer. Por outro lado, antes dessa viagem para Paris, Philip passa um ano na Alemanha, tal como Maugham passou na realidade.Ali\u00e1s, esta primeira parte at\u00e9 aos 20 anos \u00e9 o melhor do livro para mim, n\u00e3o s\u00f3 porque nos d\u00e1 a ver a crian\u00e7a que cresce sozinha, sem pais e num semin\u00e1rio, mas porque chegado \u00e0 idade de tomar decis\u00f5es verificamos que temos uma pessoa que mesmo n\u00e3o sabendo o que queria sabia o que n\u00e3o queria. Foi Philip (e Maugham) quem disse ao tio que n\u00e3o queria continua a estudar para padre e saiu do semin\u00e1rio por sua pr\u00f3pria vontade, apesar de n\u00e3o haver muito dinheiro para outras carreiras alternativas. Foi Philip (e Maugham) quem foi um ano para Alemanha estudar literatura, e depois se cansou e regressou a casa. Depois foi (e Maugham) estudar para contabilista em Londres, e no final de um ano voltou a cansar-se e a retornar para casa. Seguido por mais 2 anos em Paris, a estudar pintura, desistindo tamb\u00e9m, e retornando a casa praticamente sem dinheiro. Voltando ent\u00e3o por fim para Londres para se dedicar \u00e0 escola de medicina, tendo-se formado j\u00e1 perto dos 30 anos. Se para alguns isto pode parecer um desperd\u00edcio, para mim foi o melhor do relato, j\u00e1 que deu conta de algu\u00e9m que incessantemente se procurou a si mesmo. N\u00e3o existe nada mais dif\u00edcil do que nos encontrarmos, tanto que considero essa a maior fun\u00e7\u00e3o da escola. E por falar nela, Maugham destr\u00f3i completamente a mesma ao longo de todo o livro, n\u00e3o de modo frontal, mas subtilmente, basta ler nas entrelinhas, e analisar o seu percurso. Para fechar a compara\u00e7\u00e3o, Maugham n\u00e3o terminou o curso de medicina aos 30, mas aos 23, contudo depois do curso passou por v\u00e1rias profiss\u00f5es at\u00e9 decidir aceitar-se como escritor.Passada esta primeira parte chegamos ao miolo do livro no qual me desliguei de Philip. Mas para entrar nessa discuss\u00e3o preciso de trazer um novo dado sobre Maugham que talvez introduza mais ambiguidade do que esclarecimento, mas \u00e9 inevit\u00e1vel, e \u00e9 o facto deste ser homossexual. Tal como Proust, viveram numa \u00e9poca em que n\u00e3o o poderiam assumir, e os seus escritos acabam por funcionar como trapa\u00e7a dos seus verdadeiros sentires, nomeadamente nos romances que descrevem entre os seus alter-egos e as raparigas. Contudo julgo que Maugham sofreu mais com esta quest\u00e3o, pelo menos a julgar pelo modo como tudo isso surge aqui representado. Ali\u00e1s, a ponto de alguns cr\u00edticos lerem no p\u00e9 boto de Philip, n\u00e3o a gaguez de Maugham mas a sua homossexualidade.Assim o problema com que me defrontei a meio do livro surgiu na rela\u00e7\u00e3o entre Philip e Mildred. Philip desenvolve uma paix\u00e3o doentia por Mildred que n\u00e3o mais o largar\u00e1 para o resto da vida. Diga-se que \u00e9 esta paix\u00e3o que acaba dando for\u00e7a ao t\u00edtulo da obra, e isso afastou-me tamb\u00e9m. A certa altura pensei mesmo que o livro n\u00e3o passava de mais um romance de cordel, relatos de paix\u00f5es assolapadas, que se transformam no fim \u00faltimo das vidas dos seus personagens. E por isso cheguei a dizer no Goodreads que me apeteceu jogar o livro pela janela. Mas mantive a leitura e \u00e9 verdade que o livro avan\u00e7a n\u00e3o estagna a\u00ed e \u00e9 mesmo capaz de tornar-se ainda mais amargo que a parte inicial, ainda que termine classicamente bem.Detenho-me um pouco mais em Mildred para explicar que o caso me ocupou algum tempo. A descri\u00e7\u00e3o da rela\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e9 de total masoquismo, j\u00e1 que Mildred n\u00e3o gosta de Philip, enquanto este se transforma no c\u00e3ozinho que tudo faz para agradar \u00e0 dona, mesmo ap\u00f3s abandono crasso, volta uivando de felicidade. E vai mesmo ao ponto de magoar outras pessoas, foi a\u00ed que desliguei da personagem, por sentir que tinha ultrapassado a linha. No entanto, agora enquanto escrevo, parece-me ver outra realidade por detr\u00e1s daquelas linhas. Atente-se na descri\u00e7\u00e3o corporal que Maugham nos faz de Mildred:\u201cO corpo dela era t\u00e3o magro que era quase poss\u00edvel ver-lhe o esqueleto. O peito era liso como o de um rapaz. A boca, de l\u00e1bios finos e sem cor, era feia e a pele tinha um leve tom esverdeado.\u201dOu seja, Maugham n\u00e3o pode estar aqui a falar de uma mulher, ele est\u00e1 a falar de um homem. Por outro lado, atente-se numa outra declara\u00e7\u00e3o de Maugham ao seu sobrinho:\u201cEu tentei persuadir-me a mim mesmo que era tr\u00eas quartos normal e apenas um quarto homossexual, quando afinal era exactamente o contr\u00e1rio.\u201d W. Somerset Maugham, (Maugham, Robin 1970)Ou seja, n\u00e3o ser\u00e1 Mildred em vez da sua grande paix\u00e3o (que n\u00e3o se reconhece na vida de Maugham) antes uma representa\u00e7\u00e3o dos homens da sua vida, aqueles por quem se apaixonou, acreditando que n\u00e3o devia? \u00c9 que existe um problema claro na descri\u00e7\u00e3o de Mildred que n\u00e3o vi ainda ser discutido que o facto de ela n\u00e3o apresentar um \u00fanico tra\u00e7o positivo. Mesmo o severo tio, acaba por mostrar o seu lado positivo. Em Mildred tudo \u00e9 mau, desde a apar\u00eancia ao comportamento, pela mentira, engano e trai\u00e7\u00e3o constantes, ao desprezo pela tia e at\u00e9 ao desprezo pela filha. Tudo \u00e9 t\u00e3o terr\u00edvel e no entanto Philip n\u00e3o consegue deixar de olhar para ela como algo que deseja. Ou seja, at\u00e9 que ponto Midlred representa a sua ang\u00fastia por preferir homens a mulheres, tendo sido educado para ver nessa prefer\u00eancia o pecado, o mal?Como tudo est\u00e1 representado de modo a dar sentido aos sentires do autor mas tamb\u00e9m de modo a ser aceite pela sociedade, mascarando para o efeito os seus mais verdadeiros desejos, torna-se dif\u00edcil saber o que exatamente queria dizer Maugham. Por outro lado, permite que cada pessoa veja nos eventos e conflitos aquilo que mais se pare\u00e7a com a sua pr\u00f3pria vida. Ali\u00e1s, \u00e9 isso que muitos dos leitores referem, o facto do livro passar muito rente aos seus quotidianos. Repare-se como o t\u00edtulo \u00e9, segundo Maugham, baseado na seguinte frase de Espinosa \u2014 \u201cChamo servid\u00e3o \u00e0 impot\u00eancia do ser humano para governar ou restringir (as suas) emo\u00e7\u00f5es\u201d, e como ela pode dar conta de tantos dos problemas que assolam cada um de n\u00f3s.[*** Spoilers ***]Confesso que na leitura procurei compreender o masoquismo de Philip/Maugham na base da falta do afeto dos pais que partiram antes do tempo, do tio austero incapaz da menor emo\u00e7\u00e3o, da defici\u00eancia do p\u00e9/gaguez, mas nada disso me pareceu suficiente, e menos ainda oferecer o direito de magoar outras pessoas. No entanto, agora que leio o texto e as personagens de um modo distinto, tudo se encaixa diferentemente. A personagem Norah, que se tinha apaixonado por Philip sendo largada sem mais, apenas porque Mildred, abandonada por um outro com uma gravidez indesejada, resolve voltar para Philip, foi um baque enorme para mim, algo completamente inaceit\u00e1vel na personagem. Uma pessoa dotada de raz\u00e3o, e Philip \u00e9 algu\u00e9m profundamente racional, nunca cederia, n\u00e3o esque\u00e7amos que toda a sua humildade e incapacidade de magoar quem quer que fosse. Contudo, agora o que leio \u00e9 que Norah aceitou a natureza de Philip/Maugham, e n\u00e3o era para outra mulher que ele voltava, ele era reclamado pela sua natureza homossexual, e contra essa, Norah uma personagem de grande eleva\u00e7\u00e3o, sabia que n\u00e3o adiantaria lutar, e por isso sai de cena sem mais.Estranho como n\u00e3o consegui compreender isto na leitura, e como isto n\u00e3o surge nas discuss\u00f5es mais gen\u00e9ricas sobre o livro (acredito que existam recens\u00f5es acad\u00e9micas a aprofundar tudo isto). Vi tantas pessoas identificarem-se com algo com o qual n\u00e3o me conseguia propriamente identificar, a paix\u00e3o avassaladora que tudo leva na sua frente, quando afinal n\u00e3o era a paix\u00e3o, era algo mais profundo, ainda que isto n\u00e3o nos distancie do velho problema da luta entre a emo\u00e7\u00e3o e a raz\u00e3o. Porque diga-se Maugham ter\u00e1 passado grande parte da vida nas lutas desse dualismo. N\u00e3o nos esque\u00e7amos que casou com uma mulher e teve uma filha. Ele acreditou que a homosexualidade era algo que podia controlar, e gra\u00e7as \u00e0 sua humildade deve ter conseguido sujeitar-se a levar a vida que todos \u00e0 sua volta levavam. Mas a natureza humana n\u00e3o \u00e9 mera paix\u00e3o, o fogo que arde sem se ver \u00e9 ef\u00e9mero, mas a natureza da homossexualidade n\u00e3o \u00e9 paix\u00e3o, mera emo\u00e7\u00e3o, como Maugham tentou definir a partir de Espinosa, \u00e9 algo muito mais profundo, e este livro acaba a mostrar isso mesmo.Terminando, \u201cServid\u00e3o Humana\u201d n\u00e3o \u00e9 aquilo que muitos nos venderam, de ser um livro sobre a raz\u00e3o de viver, nem sequer \u00e9 sobre aquilo que Maugham disse, de ser um comp\u00eandio das filosofias que tinha constru\u00eddo at\u00e9 a\u00ed, ou talvez seja, mas agora vejo que \u00e9 muito mais do que isso, \u00e9 um grito a partir do seu sentir mais \u00edntimo. Repare-se como at\u00e9 mesmo a cita\u00e7\u00e3o constante do evolucionismo de Darwin que serve para definir a tal aus\u00eancia de fundamento da vida, deve ser lido antes como a refuta\u00e7\u00e3o do cristianismo que penaliza o desejo e criminaliza a homossexualidade. E mais ainda, como o Darwinismo retira das costas de Maugham a culpa de ter nascido assim, justificando a sua incapacidade de torcer a sua natureza para se fazer entrar dentro dos preceitos morais da religi\u00e3o.[\"Laoco\u00f6n\" (1604-1614) de El Greco. El Greco coloca Laocoon, o troiano que tentou avisar Tr\u00f3ia daquilo que se escondia no Cavalo dos gregos, com Toledo no fundo.]Claro que tudo isto acaba passando e Maugham porque n\u00e3o podia ser frontal, se o tivesse sido provavelmente este livro n\u00e3o teria sido um romance, e certamente n\u00e3o um romance de enorme sucesso, e acaba criando uma fachada de vit\u00f3ria e j\u00fabilo no final, com direito a casal satisfeito com o mundo \u201ctal como ele devia ser\u201d. Julgo que este final que no livro serve para dar conta de um Philip que triunfou na vida e conseguiu atingir o equil\u00edbrio esperado dele, acaba por servir para dar conta do amb\u00edguo sentimento de Maugham sobre si pr\u00f3prio. Atentemos em dois detalhes: Sally, a namorada final, n\u00e3o reage de forma muito natural, parecendo mais uma personagem de cera, dotada de todas as qualidades morais que a sociedade prezava, mas estranhamente distante de todos e mesmo de Philip; e segundo, Philip faz uma escolha final, resolve ficar com Sally por receio de a ter engravidado, j\u00e1 que a sua vontade era viajar para Toledo para conhecer as pegadas de El Greco, um dos artistas mais individuais de sempre, e que alguns historiadores etiquetam como homosexual. No fundo, Maugham est\u00e1 aqui a dar conta da sua ambiguidade, j\u00e1 que numa fase inicial da sua vida namorou com raparigas, e depois casou com uma mulher, e s\u00f3 a partir do meio da sua vida passou ent\u00e3o a partilhar, abertamente, a intimidade exclusivamente com homens.[*** Fim de Spoilers ***]Cheguei a pensar retirar uma estrela pelo que Philip tinha feito, mas depois de ter escrito este texto, n\u00e3o consigo. A escrita de Maugham \u00e9 boa, n\u00e3o deslumbra com virtuosismo, mas mant\u00eam-nos presos ao livro todo o tempo ao longo da enorme quantidade de p\u00e1ginas que perfazem o mesmo, o que d\u00e1 bem conta da sua qualidade. Por outro lado, \u00e9 um relato que marca a nossa hist\u00f3ria, vai ao fundo do \u00e2mago daquilo que sente quem tem de passar todo o tempo escondido por detr\u00e1s de uma fachada a ponto de j\u00e1 n\u00e3o conseguir distinguir essa fachada de si mesmo.Publicado no VI em:https://virtual-illusion.blogspot.pt/..."}], "description": "The first and most autobiographical of Maugham's masterpieces.
