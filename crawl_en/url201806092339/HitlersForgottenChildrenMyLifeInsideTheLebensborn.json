Heinrich Himmler wrote the policies for selecting the \u201cbest\u201d. Nazis took for Lebensborn, from among the blond, blue eyed children from the places and families they destroyed, those who fit the eugenic metrics of perfect Aryans. Lebensborn also sheltered \u201chealthy\u201d unwed mothers who met standards of pure German heredity (forbears to 1800); Many were sweethearts of married SS officers. There were several of these nurseries/adoption facilities in Germany and occupied areas of Europe. Not every child left the home for an adopted family. Those found not to measure up in looks or behavior went to work camps and/or to their death.Ingrid von Oelhafen first describes her childhood, what she remembers of her \u201cparents\u201d and how she learned of her other identity. When she began her quest to find her birth parents, she had no idea that something like this existed or that this is where she spent the first few months of her life. She describes the difficulty of getting information, particularly through government sources, even for non-research purposes, like getting a passport. It took many years, but she found others from Lebensborn facilities who were also piecing together their past. She describes \u201cthe Father Finder\u201d and how he helped her connect, at last, with what remained of her birth family.I was, at first, impatient with Ingrid\u2019s story of her childhood, her parent\u2019s separation, leaving East Germany, and living separately with her adoptive mother, then father and mother (again). She never explores why this cold couple would bother to adopt children. Later I saw how important this background was to who she is, and generically, the dynamics of how families kept their secrets in post-war Germany.There are short histories of the areas of importance, actual letters and documents (translated) of pertinent correspondence and official policies. There stories of other survivors and descriptions of the nurseries from their accounts and other records. There are amazing photographs.That there are still Lebensborn children alive to tell their stories reminds us that the Nazis and the horrors the brought are not ancient, but recent history."}, {"userName": "Ctgt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt", "userReview": "What is identity? How is it formed? And does identity shape the person-or is it the other way around?Noticed this book at the library and I had never heard of Lebensborn so I picked it up thinking it was a traditional history book but it is more of a memoir with moments of historical references included as the author attempts to learn the truth of her past.It is still a little murky to me how the program started and some of this may stem from the lack of real documentation regarding the beginning. Whether it was a way to help unwed mothers, as initially alluded to, or a \"stud farm\" for SS officers, over time it morphed in to a scheme to advance the Aryan race and eventually an avenue to kidnap children of those conquered in the Nazi rise.Plenty of reminders of just how abhorrent the Nazi regime was, especially those at the top. From an SS \"baptism\"Ruthild told me that she and other children underwent a quasi-religious naming ceremony in which they were dedicated to Hitler and the brotherhood of the SS.This Namensgebung ritual was a distorted version of the traditional Christian baptism, with an altar draped in a swastika flag and with a bust or a photo of the Fuhrer in pride of place. In front of a congregation made up of Lebensborn staff and black-uniformed SS officers, mothers like Ruthild\u2019s promised that their children would be raised as good National Socialists; they then handed over their babies to an SS man who intoned a \u201cblessing\u201d. Then an SS dagger was held over the baby and the senior officer intoned a formal welcome to the brotherhood of the SS.We take you into our community as a limb of our body. You shall grow up in our protection and bring honour to your name, pride to your brotherhood and inextinguishable glory to your race.A portion of a speech made by Himmler in October 1943I consider that in dealing with members of a foreign country, especially some Slav nationality, we must not start from German points of view and we must not endow these people with decent German thoughts and logical conclusions of which they are not capable, but we must take them as they really are.Obviously in such a mixture of peoples there will always be some racially good types. Therefore I think that it is our duty to take their children with us, to remove them from their environments, if necessary by robbing or stealing them. Either we win over any good blood that we can use for ourselves, and give it a place in our people, or we destroy this blood.When the Lebensborn program didn't work as planned i.e. more German babies, it began to morph in to a way for the Nazis to try and increase the population by kidnapping children in the areas they over ran. So using the above quote from Himmler, the Nazis embarked on a Eugenics type culling of children in the occupied areas to weed out the undesirables and keep those children who fit their ideal and place them in Lebensborn homes.All these moments are revealed as the author tries to unravel the mysteries of her past and struggles over the years to find others who, like her, were taken from their parents by the Nazis. 7/10"}, {"userName": "Carlos", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1701553-carlos", "userReview": "This is the story of a woman who as a child was taken from her parents and given in adoption to a German couple. This is the story of a regime that stained Europe from 1939 to 1945, this is a story of Nazi Germany. She was the victim of \"germanization\" a word coined by Himmler himself (Hitler's second on command). Kids who looked Aryan were to be taken from families all over occupied Europe and be given to German families to be raised in Nazi Ideals, This was policy back then. In this book we wont see to much feeling because the author stays away from that and the story is told from an objective point of view, in the book we will see the name Hitler, Himmler, Nazis, SS, Partisans, Communism and Cold War appear all over, This is the story of a woman who was victim of the Nazi Legacy, this is the story of a continent who still bears the scars of that time. this is the story of a group of people who share the same tragic background, This is a story you should read if you want to understand modern Europe."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/896357-kevin", "userReview": "There are hidden depths to the depravity of the Nazis. Their belief that Aryan blood was the highest ideal of race caused them to systematically steal children from occupied areas to be raised by \"Good Germans.\" They used their belief in blood and race to label some as \"Untermenschen\" or less than human so they could justify slavery and extermination. They used blood as an excuse for systematic rape.

As Hitler eliminated those not worthy in concentration camps, his troops were assisting him in increasing the German aryan population through any means possible.This is just one account of thousands by a woman who was taken as a baby and placed with a foster family. The authors subsequent struggle to find her real identity and surviving relatives is the story that follows. Some of the book details the history of the SS and its prime members, but much of the story is hers and how she has dealt with the legacy of her early years.

This is a real account of Ingrid Von Oelhafen's search to find her origins after she was kidnapped by the Nazi's in Yugoslavia during the war and sent to live with foster parents in Germany.

The facts of Ingrid's childhood were few, but it just needed a very good editor to make it into a good book. A very sad story, but it's important that this side of Nazis is also revealed to the big audience. What just wonders me is Ingrid's brother Dietmar. After he was taken into foster care, Ingrid stops talking about him and doesn't seem to want to know what happened to him. She thought him to be his real brother for years and then just forgets him. Really? Why wasn't she at least interested in finding out if Dietmar was also a Lebenborn?

Coming from a Polish family that suffered at the hands of Nazi and Soviet alike and brought up with the horrors of what both did to the people from the Polish Baltic down to Yugoslavia in the south, the Jew and Slav were victims, some more than others.Like most Eastern European families, those who have had to live in a country other than that of their forefathers since 1945 for various reasons, where were brought up on the rumours and knowledge of the Russians committed crimes at Katyn (which they still try and deny) and that the Nazis stole babies away from their mothers across Eastern Europe but never really understood why.Hitler\u2019s Forgotten Children is Ingrid von Oelhafen version of that age old question of who am I? Even more so when she discovered that she was an unwitting part of the Lebensborn programme created by Himmler and that the Nazis had done everything they could to destroy her true identity. This is her journey in to finding who she really was as well as an examination of Lebensborn a much forgotten Nazi pogrom to create more \u2018Aryan\u2019 children that had been born to people who were \u2018substandard\u2019.To those who think they know much about what happened during the Second World War tend not to know much about Lebensborn, and this is part memoir, part history lesson. This is an important book that will guide you through what was and still is a hideous pogrom whose children are still coming to terms with it today.Lebensborn is the name of the pogrom that Himmler created for children that were born to Slavic women but were \u2018blonde haired and blue eyed\u2019 clearly a freak of nature and had to be taken from them and placed with good \u2018Aryan\u2019 families in Germany. Lebensborn shows the obsession that the Nazis had with blood lines and racial purity and this book covers all aspects of this terrible history.What we learn from this book is the Ingrid felt dislocated from her German family and how she was dumped in a children\u2019s home after the escape from the Soviet zones in Germany after the war. Her and her \u2018brother\u2019 dumped there by her good German \u2018mother\u2019. It is only after the end of the cold war and the end of the divided Germany did the facts start to be revealed and that Ingrid found that she was a Lebensborn child. From there started a painful but important journey and how shocking it is when you see the bureaucracy and the state secrecy that stopped her discovering the truth about herself.Hitler\u2019s Forgotten Children is part memoir part history lesson that many who think they know about the Nazis will be shocked at. One has to remember that these babies were stolen during the war and are in the 70s now and some are coming to terms and some just cannot come to terms with their status. They are still unwitting victims today and reading Ingrid von Oelhafen\u2019s account you will find a well written well researched and knowledgeable account, written with compassion.This is a one of a number of dark periods of European history and this is still going on today as Europe has still come to terms with the effects of war and being divided. Think how hard it must be to know that most of your life has been a lie and the one you should have had was stolen from you in the aid of \u2018racial purity\u2019."}, {"userName": "Tweedledum ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20494551-tweedledum", "userReview": "I consider myself pretty well read on the atrocities and barbarism of Nazi Germany but it seems there are depths to the warped and twisted mindset still waiting to be fully brought into the light.

I know of Hitler's dreams of a master race the same as everybody else does. He wanted a superior Aryan (also known as Nordic) race, a world eradicated of anyone who wasn't blue-eyed with blonde hair. Anyone who didn't conform to the Nazi party was suddenly in danger, as were those we weren't German, and especially the Jews.I picked this up super cheap on Kindle a while ago, having vaguely recognised the word 'Lebensborn' though from Lord knows where, and thought it'd be an interesting read. Now, I've read autobiographies and memoirs of people from so many different parts of the war: soldiers from numerous countries, Holocaust survivors, the English people whose houses were reduced to rubble in the street, German citizens dreading the arrival of the Russian soldiers in 1945. What I've never read about is Lebensborn.I was very vaguely aware of experiments on children deemed to be part of the master race. It's not something we're taught in school or see in the vast majority of documentaries about WWII. It was something that was always whispered between pupils in class or the playground when the War was mentioned in History lessons. I couldn't have even imagined the size of the story behind those experiments that kids used to whisper about.This is part memoir, part history book. Ingrid Matko-von-Oelhafen weaves her story with the history behind what she was a part of. To learn her past she delved not only into how Lebensborn worked but also its creation, Heinrich Himmler's obsession with a pure, strong, master race, and the SS. I learned so many new things. I had no idea of the SS's history or of the extent of Himmler's obsession with purity from its start. He had such a bizarre mind and considering some of the ideas he was so consumed by it's honestly a wonder he rose so high in Hitler's ranks without his sanity being questioned. And then there was Lebensborn itself, 'perfect' German children born out of wedlock in the Lebensborn centres where both child and mother were treated with care and discretion, but the floor below is filled with children stolen from families in countries the Nazis have conquered. Ingrid's story is both terrible and inspirational, and I couldn't put it down at all.It's also beautifully written. At no point is this book boring, even the chapters of history were compelling and just begged to be read. I don't know who did it, I know Ingrid Matko-von-Oelhafen wrote at least the base, and Tim Tate also helped with the writing, and then they obviously had an editor as well. They're clearly the dream team because this book flowed wonderfully and I devoured it.Hitler's Forgotten Children is one of the best memoirs I've ever read. I 100% recommend this to everyone."}, {"userName": "Rosemary Ellis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10909424-rosemary-ellis", "userReview": "Opposite Hitler's Final Solution was Lebensborn.

The author struggled with a difficult relationship with her parents and was left frequently in children's homes. Eventually, she realized that she was not the biological child of her parents, but was not allowed to ask any questions. She grew up feeling isolated and unloved until she was contacted by the Red Cross and learned that she was a foster child. The few clues she had from the documents she found as she went through her mother's effects began her long journey to finding that she was a Lebensborn baby. She continued to search until she found some of her family in Yugoslavia, but even then she did not feel the kind of connection she longed for.I have read several books about the Lebensborn children, but this is the first one that dealt with the details of the lives of children found in conquered countries who were sent back to Lebensborn to be \"Germanized.\" In this book, the author describes how she learned that her parents were required to go to the town center where the men who had resisted the Nazis were lined up and shot in front of the horrified crowd. Then the Nazi's looked over the children and any that appeared to be Germanic were taken from their mothers and siblings and kept in a building until the Nazis could put them on trains to carry them to Germany. Older children were in charge of the babies and toddlers. The author didn't just leave the description there. The babies had no clean diapers or bottles of milk at the proper time. In fact, they were delayed 4-1/2 hours and were kept in a large room with no food or place to lie down. She helps the readers understand what it was like for the children who had no idea where they were being taken or what would happen to them. Modern parents, when faced with a long journey with children prepare for days and, along with the necessaries, they provide things for their children to do and make frequent stops for exercise. These children were often put in railway cars for journies that took days. At each step of her journey, the author takes the reader into the mind of the stolen child and conveys the fear and bewilderment. She details the number of living situations the children had to get used to only to be swept off to another placement and another group of strangers.She also describes the contrast between what Hitler was trying to build by taking these children and what the actual result was. How could human beings treat children as property and then expect them to grow up to be the leaders of a super race? How could they look at these children who were bred or stolen to supplement a flagging birth rate? Most interesting, given all the preoccupation with the Nordic perfection, was the description of the adult Lebensborn children in later support groups. They looked around the groups and saw the same mix of people that could have been found anywhere. There were no perfect looking people who radiated leadership and success. There was no sign of a super race. Another aspect I found interesting was the description of the minds of Hitler and Himmler and their preoccupation with purifying the race. I knew that they were obsessed with getting rid of the undesirables such as the Jews and Gypsies, but I did not fully understand how their understanding of race undergirded everything they did. Reading the book left me with amazement at the way they replaced God with themselves as creators of a new and better race. They manipulated people with no thought of the Geneva conventions and basic human rights. The hubris of these men was unbelievable."}, {"userName": "Janne Paananen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4853662-janne-paananen", "userReview": "Kolmannen valtakunnan kadotetut lapset kertoo Ingrid von Oelhafenin tarinan.

One, the tragic kidnapping of \"Germanic\" children from their Slavic parents; and two, birth-houses for the care of unwed mothers. While the first is notably horrible, the second seems rather noble. I suppose when you consider that many of the babies born in these houses were children of high-up SS officers, there is something somewhat uneasy about it, but technically, there wasn't anything really sinister about it. It is hardly \"one of the most terrible of all Nazi experiments,\" as the back of the book suggests.Ingrid von Oelhafen's story focuses on the first of the Lebensborn programs just mentioned. Clearly, this was a horrible tragedy, one of the many atrocities committed by the Nazis, but Oelhafen reveals a bit of moral ambiguity here. After returning to Slovakia and seeking out her family, she realizes, that in a sense, her life has been far richer and more fufilling than what she would have expected had she grown up in Yugoslavia. But she was taken as a baby. She has no recollection of her time there. The tragedy is really for the family who lost a baby, not for her. Hers is that she was placed in a home where the parents were less than ideal. And in this her story is really no different that any story of a foster child, placed in a home where they are less than wanted, and who one day discovers the truth. Von Oelhafen's story is really the story of the discovery of her roots, one that originated in tragedy, no doubt, but nonetheless, is the similar path that many foster and adopted children make. It has little to do with the Lebensborn program, I think.For most of these children, the problem is not like von Oelhafen's. The problem is that they are the illegitimate children of SS men, and no one wants to have anything to do with them. Either way, the book is not so horrifying as the jacket makes it out to be. Her story is certainly interesting and she gives a nice historical background to it, but it really is just a case of a foster child searching for her roots, albeit in these very unique circumstances."}, {"userName": "Jo Barton", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2090731-jo-barton", "userReview": "I have to say that I knew nothing about the Lebensborn programme before I started to read Ingrid's fascinating and at times, difficult account of how, in 1942 aged just 9 months, she was taken from her parents in Yugoslavia and 'adopted' into the Von Oelhafen family.When the war ends, Ingrid is three and half years old and is living with her mother, grandmother and younger brother, Dietmar in Bandekow in the Mecklenburg region of Germany. However, in the aftermath of the Second World War many German lives were fractured beyond repair, and Ingrid grew up in a state of fear and disruption. Her childhood was a lonely and frightening time and, as both of her parents had their own worries, Ingrid often faced an uncertain future. When she was eleven Ingrid discovered that she wasn't who she thought she was, and as she entered young adulthood she began a painstaking and difficult search for her true identity, which, over time, was to prove challenging and not without complications.Reading through Ingrid's account of her life and of her search to find out more about her origins is a sobering experience and I learned much about the history of post-war Germany along with the complicated process of missing identity. The story flows well and Ingrid is a fascinating raconteur; her resolute determination to find out the truth is a credit to both her strength of purpose and utter resilience.There is so much to share within the story which would be spoiled if I gave anything else away, so I will end with this quote from the book which states \"we are not defined by the facts of our birth but rather by the choices we make throughout life..\" Ingrid is an inspirational lady and I am glad to have had the opportunity to read her story."}, {"userName": "Mimi Fintel", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23695672-mimi-fintel", "userReview": "During Hitler's reign of terror, he wanted Aryan type Germans to do a lot of procreating to increase the population of Germany. He thought this Aryan \"blood\" would make his country the strongest in the world. However, he realized that even if Germans had more children, he still wouldn't have a big enough population. His solution then, was to kidnap children from countries that the Nazi's invaded. Children with blond hair and blue eyes were favored to be \"Germanized.\" These children were sent to the Lebensborn home. There they were subjected to many medical tests, forbidden to speak their home languages, and eventually sent to German families to be fostered and given new German names. Their foster parents usually told them nothing about their early lives, so these people found it very difficult to find out where they had come from. This book is one woman's story. She was born in 1941. She was raised as Ingrid Von Oelhafen by what she thought were her mother and father in Germany. Eventually she found out they were her foster parents. She did not really begin her search until many years later when she was in her 50's. She was shocked by what she learned as she searched for her identity. This is an insightful but sad book. So many lives were ruined. Nearly 500,000 children were abducted across Europe and \"Germanized.\" Even after the war ended, many children were not reunited with their original families. Those that were, still struggled since they had no memory of their early lives and could not speak the language of their families. I found this book to be an important one, in hopes that history never repeats itself in this way."}, {"userName": "Trixi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1438432-trixi", "userReview": "An interesting read about a topic I hadn't ever read about. Ingrid was kidnapped by the Nazis, a plan to raise Aryan children in Germany properly. She was under a year old at the time and was placed in a foster home, with her adoptive father working for the Wehrmacht in southern Germany and she living with her adoptive mother and extended family in northeast Germany during the war. Her memories were not happy ones as her mother was distant and when she lived with her father, she found him very frightening. She was also sent off to boarding school, all the while just wanting love of her mother. When a medical document with a different name is used, she starts wondering who this other person is and how it relates to her, but gets no answers from her parents. Even when she is an adult and starts pressing her mother to give her information, she gets nothing. Until she finally goes through some of her mothers documents while cleaning out her house and finds information that indicates she was part of the Lebensborn program, and then gets some information from the German Red Cross that verifies that she was indeed part of this program. With help of others and the eventual opening of records after the Berlin wall falls, she is able to discover where she was originally from and that she has relatives that live there. The book has lots of information about the Lebensborn program as well as how she felt throughout the years of not knowing who she really was and how so many people and things conspired to keep the information from her."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3414482-barbara", "userReview": "On a scale of cotton candy to Brussels sprouts, Hitler's Forgotten Children by Ingrid Von Oelhafen is roasted brussels sprouts dusted in salt and sugar. The high temperatures of roasting soften the bitter flavor of this vegetable. And the sugar and salt beckons further helpings.Hitler's Forgotten Children details the account of Ingrid Von Oelhafen/Erika Matko as she searches for her true identity after discovering she had been a part of the secret Lebensborn program. Heinrich Himmler planned to repopulate Germany with a super human, Aryan race with Lebensborn. At the end of WWII and the fall of the Nazis, untangling the influence of this program proved difficult and convoluted. No one wanted to talk about it.Reading a book like Hitler's Forgotten Children forces the reader (me) to consider the discomfort of the horrible things that have occurred in history. Questions plague me: How does this type of thing happen? Would I bend so easily to such a cynical rule? But mostly, I'm shocked at the culture of silence and shame that rules Germany. Of course, my American perspective deeply colors my perspective because I want everyone to just sit down and talk it out.And yet, wouldn't it be easier to forget that this happened? I think many people chose to do that. I can't fault them. But, I'm glad for this book, and I admire the bravery of Ingrid Von Oelhafen to ask questions when it pushed against the very core of her upbringing."}, {"userName": "Grace", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9747516-grace", "userReview": "Many items about WWII that I was unaware of were uncovered in this story. I have read books about the holocaust and WWII in general since I was in high school, so a total of about 22 years. I'm not an expert and usually stick to novels so I am not to be considered a historian by any stretch of the imagination. I had heard of the existence of lebensborn homes in a novel that I read last year but as it was fictional I didn't figure there was much concrete information about this. Well, I was wrong! This story is engrossing and not only provides a wealth of new information it comes from a survivor of the Lebensborn homes during WWII. This isn't a fictional story or novel. I am amazed by this story and even posted about it on Facebook. This is a book worth reading, we should all know about this. We hear general stories about the war that are similar to what we have previously read, heard, or been taught. But this . . . this is something new and big and horrible. It's good to hear it first hand. It took this woman her lifetime to uncover the truth about her origins and this impacted thousands of children. Insane amounts of children were sterilized by the German's as well, also under the direction of Himmler. Himmler and Hitler were listed as God father's on these children's birth certificates. Identities were erased. This is a book to read and to not take lightly."}, {"userName": "Pirate", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11420507-pirate", "userReview": "Extremely moving account and a must read of another innocent group of people subject to the base criminality of the Nazis ludicrous hare-brained racial purity policies...children. Ingrid von Oelhafen's traumatic journey of discovery without any help from her German 'parents' is extraordinary. What is perverse -- quite apart from Himmler's deranged beliefs which emanate in part from his background as a chicken farmer -- is the judges at Nuremberg --in one of the later trials -- didn't find the people directly associated with the Lebensborn programme to be guilty of any crime even though they knew thousands of the children had been kidnapped from their real homes. If they were looking for love in those homes prior to being allocated to 'deserving' Nazi loyalist families then they had another thing coming collective beatings if one child wet their bed and so on. Not all the children lifted from their communities of course even made it to the homes...if they failed the revolting 'Aryan master race' physical assessments they were carted off on trains to the death camps. Sounds gloomy of course but the superb writing and dignified manner in which she and Tim Tate relate the journey and the background makes it a journey well worth accompanying them on.

The book is well researched, that is the best part of the book , and the stories of how this operation came to be and the experiences of the children is fascinating. She repeatedly rails against her mother for keeping her history from her, yet she doesn't seem to accept responsibility for not wanting to know her history until she got a call from the Red Cross 40 years after the war ended. When she started looking in earnest, many people who could have helped her were gone. The biggest gap in the story, for me, was her failure to examine the story of the brother she had in her German family.

The fact that this story was published in 2015, that I have read so many books, novels, articles, and more on WWII, touching on the effects of Nazism, I am almost in disbelief that this is the first time, I've heard of Lebensborn. Ingrid spent half a century figuring out who she was and it wasn't until 2007 when certain archives were opened that certain pieces fell into place. This woman, as a baby, was stolen from her family, placed with a foster mother and father who didn't like each other and didn't seem to like her. They hid the truth from her. Even had she learned the truth, she would have been traumatized in a different way. Then, once as an older adult, she is ready to learn more about her origins, she is prevented by so many organizations who were reluctant to share what they know. Just when I thought, there wasn't much left to discover about this so often, revisited time in history, I read this and discover another layer and more details.
