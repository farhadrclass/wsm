This was slightly more substantial than the last few fluff chick-lit novels I've read, but not too much so. I think it took itself more seriously than it actually was, trying to make a statement about medical marijuana as well as pulling in some fairly far-reaching plot points, but it was an interesting enough read. The novel switches between the perspectives of three generations of Moon family women: Allegra, her daughter Mariah, and Mariah's twelve year old daughter Lindsay. After being laid off from her University teaching position, Mariah moves herself and Lindsay in with her mother and grandmother who live in the apartment over the family business, the Owl & Moon Cafe, near the beach in the coastal city of Monterey. As to be expected there are some tensions of these very different women all loving together, which is not helped by Allegra's diagnosis of leukemia. While they try to put aside old arguments in the effort of taking care of Allegra during her chemotherapy, they are not always successful, and it turns out that their path to understanding one another and becoming a closer family is much more nuanced and difficult than expected. In my opinion the most interesting character was Mariah's mother, Allegra. She is a product of the 70's and is as interested in the latest cause as she is in organic cooking in her cafe. She made mistakes in her youth, getting pregnant at 16, but is now trying to make amends for her parenting mistakes with Mariah by being a better grandmother to her granddaughter Lindsay. She's an infectious personality who makes her quirky cafe a popular spot among the locals. Her progression and acceptance of her leukemia was the most interesting journey for me in this novel. The author uses Lindsay, the smarter-than-average kid who attends a pricey private school, to bring in the topic of medical marijuana (she does her science project on it based on her grandmother's illness). It was ok and kind of interesting, but seemed like a bit of a side point. I'm not one for the \"genius kid\" characters in novels though as most authors really have trouble creating a voice authentic enough to be knowledgable and innocent. It generally just rings false to me, as it did here from time to time. Maybe I'm just being nit-picky, but everyone has their little things and this is one of mine. Maybe it won't bother you a bit. Anyway, it was an interesting read that helped me pass a lazy Saturday morning while I had the house to myself. I'd recommend it if you're looking for something a bit more substantial than your normal chick-lit, but not too heavy."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/330479-sandra", "userReview": "Love, love, loved it!

In this case it would partially be due to reader expectations. The book was recommended to me as a novel with elements of magical realism in it which, alas, never appeared. Instead we have the story of four women who are forced to live together over the family owned caf\u00e9. We have Gammy the bible spouting \u201celder\u2019 of the clan and her daughter, Allegra who is an aging hippie about to be diagnosed with leukemia. Rounding out the cast of characters we have Allegra\u2018s daughter Mariah a recently unemployed college professor and her daughter Lindsey are forced to live with Allegra due to the job loss. Mariah comes across as a bitter, pinched sort of soul while 12 year old precocious Lindsey appears to be the most mature of the four women.What I liked about the story was Lindsey and her decision to discuss the use of medical marijuana as a science project as Lindsey watched her grandmother become sicker and sicker due to her treatments. The author was careful to mention that Allegra had tried a wide variety of medications to try and stem the nausea including Marinol and that none of them had been effective so it was logical for Lindsey to consider medical marijuana. Lindsey was probably, for me the most accurately drawn of the characters. Her feelings and emotions as a middle schooled rang true for me. Some of Mariah\u2019s emotions also seemed to ring true as well. I did understand why she was resentful of her mother and her newly found father even though she was a 34 year old woman.What didn\u2019t work for me were the sketchily drawn personalities of the older characters. Grammy was a walking stereotype of the older Christian woman constantly praying for the souls of her sinner relatives and co-worker. She was so heavy handed in fact I was amazed that Simon the gay cook had managed to work for her all those years or that the caf\u00e9 managed to attract return customers. Then we have Allegra, the epitome of aging hippydom who meditates, has her chakras adjusted etc and yet who then seems to settle pretty comfortably into the life of being a doctor\u2019s fianc\u00e9. The doctor, incidentally, just happens to be her one true love from 33 years ago and Mariah\u2019s father, a touch too much of a coincidence for me. She barely protests his huge house or gas guzzling cars and seems more than happy to give up her life at the caf\u00e9 even though at one point she mourns the loss of her daily social contacts there. Yet, hippie that she allegedly is she refuses to smoke the marijuana that would help in her recovery and stimulate her appetite and for the most contrived of reasons. We are told constantly throughout the book that she will not become healthy again unless she eats and gains weight so after a certain point I just felt like hitting her over the head and yelling \u201csmoke already\u201d. Finally we have Mariah who is bitterly uptight. I was amazed she was able to attract Fergus as she came across the page as a really unsympathetic somewhat self absorbed individual and yet we are expected to believe this man would court her and then ultimately fall in love with her. I also had difficulty with the fact that Mariah would on a nightly basis abandon both her daughter and her sick mother to the care of Gammy, who was constantly being described as being in poor health herself due to her varicose veins. Because I never really felt attached to any of the characters except Lindsey I cannot really recommend this book unless you are looking for a simple feel good story.Oh and one last nitpicky point \u2013 while Carmel by the Sea is the name of the town no one refers to it by its full name. This admittedly minor point drove me nuts throughout the book."}, {"userName": "Mary Lou", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1267139-mary-lou", "userReview": "The Owl and Moon Cafe by Jo-Ann Mapson is typical chick lit: love, secrets, and conflict, plus a bit of a coming of age story. The cast includes four generations of women, three single parents. The setting is Pacific Grove, California, a charming beach town; the time frame, fall through New Year's 1990-91. The conflicts are ostensibly different values among the women and a diagnosis of leukemia. Mapson does a capable job of building interest in the characters and the story. Mapson's philosophy and key theme is \"If you see your happiness out there on the horizon, honey, you run for it like hell's hounds are on your heels. Don't let somebody else steal it.\" (326).Plot details follow.Gammy Bess is the matriarch; Allegra, Bess's daughter; Mariah, Allegra's daughter; and Lindsay, Mariah's daughter. Bess met Myron Moon on the rebound, married him when their one night stand left her pregnant, was widowed and then ejected from Moon's rich family with the gift of the property that is now the Owl and Moon cafe (186).Allegra had a summer fling with Alvin Goodnough just after he returned from Vietnam, during his last free summer before medical school. His parents will fund it, but they expect him to marry a woman he's known all his life. When Allegra finds herself pregnant, she doesn't tell him or Mariah (110).The novel begins with Mariah losing her position as assistant professor of sociology just as the fall quarter is about to begin. Mariah and Lindsay move to the apartment about the cafe where Allegra lives because Mariah can't afford Lindsay's their apartment and private school for Lindsay. Only 12, but in 8th grade because of her 175 IQ, Lindsay is fascinated by science and idolizes Carl Sagan.Like many others written in the beginning of the 21st century, the novel is almost too inclusive. In addition to the single moms and leukemia, there is a gay cook (Simon Huggins) and Goodnough moves to the area, after overcoming the death of his daughter and being divorced by his wife, in time to diagnose Allegra's leukemia and Lindsay's bleeding ulcer. Naturally, he is rich. Mariah begins a relationship with a man from Scotland, Allegra goes into remission and moves in with Doc who is adored by Lindsay and gradually accepted by Mariah. Bess moves away from the cafe and Simon steps up to partner with Mariah."}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5868516-natalie", "userReview": "This book wasn't great, it was simply pretty good. It flowed alright, and the characters were believable to a point. What I found the hardest to believe was that everything had been plodding along in this life that these women had created, the same way for 12 years, then all of a sudden, everything completely changed in a year. That can happen with a cancer diagnosis, I don't begrudge Mapson that- I have first hand experience. However, everything else- Allegra finding her lost love, Lindsay taking the huge chance at the science fair AND finding a best friend, Mariah suddenly coming out of her shell and falling in love, and Gammy giving up the cafe, all in a year? I don't think so. Too much went down in a short period of time for it to really be believable. Mariah drove me up the wall- initially refusing to go out with Fergus, second guessing sleeping with him and berating herself for falling in love with him. I felt like she needed a wake up slap. No one told Gammy to shove her unwanted judgmental Christian ideals either- and that drives me insane. \"It's ok if I judge you if I stand behind this cross.\" However, that is an argument for another day. I know that the author had a note at the end of the novel stating that she didn't have a hidden agenda with the Marijuana, but that just made me believe it all the more. Why that topic? If she really wanted to write about it, why not have the novel centered around it? If the controversy really intrigued Mapson so much, she should have had Lindsay be the center of the novel, tell the whole thing from her perspective, and have it focus almost wholly on this taboo science project. It felt like she did enough research to touch on a few things about Mary Jane, but not enough to really feel like she put in the effort. After all this, you might be wondering how I even enjoyed the novel at all. I did enjoy Allegra, and Simon, and the way Sally told off the school bullies made me feel vindicated, somehow. The pacing was ok, except during the middle of the book where it slowed down to a snail's pace. It ended on a feel good note, but there wasn't enough epilogue for my taste. If you like those novels where enough good happens to make you feel life is worth living, yet enough cynicism to bring you back down to Earth a little, this might just be for you."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2081924-sara", "userReview": "A story which has a bit of all of us in it!"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1409064-christine", "userReview": "This wasn't bad. I was a little skeptical at first, kind of worried that we were in romance/\"women's lit\" territory, which isn't usually my cup of tea, but it didn't end up being too romancy for me. Despite there being two big romance stories (one with a superrich doctor and one with a ruggedly handsome Scot) (seriously) (I mean... could that stuff be any more clich\u00e9?). There were other storylines that reeled me in though, and while the line of \"finding my perfect mate will solve ALL THE THINGS wrong in my life!\" was certainly trod, it wasn't overdone. The focus was mainly on the three younger generations of Moon women and their lifestuff + relationships with each other. The youngest was my favourite, my penchant for YA lit showing I guess. The whole book did feel a little like a public service announcement against health insurance companies and pro medical marijuana. There was a fourth \"elderly\" Moon, Gammy, but we never had a chapter from her point of view so I would consider her more of a supporting character. And can we just take a moment to note that sixty-eight is not elderly? Cripes. She was written like an ninety-eight year old from pioneer days, but the women I know in their mid-sixties are not exactly at the crone stage of life. Maybe being in your sixties was a lot worse back in... when was this published? 2006? Oh. Well maybe this was written a lot earlier than that, I think it must have been because no one breathed a word about mobile phones. So yeah... a few things didn't make a lot of sense, a few characters were less well developed than others, and it was definitely a deliberate heard-string-puller but I enjoyed most of it anyway.

The characters are all complete opposites, yet they come together nicely, in a way that somehow complements each other. The story line revolves around a four generation family of women. Gammy, the oldest, is a devoutly religious woman who is constantly praying for the salvation of her daughter's soul. Her daughter, Allegra, is an old school hippie with no fear of getting arrested for the right cause. Allegra's daughter, Mariah, is a more conservative woman, a recently unemployed college sociology professer. The final member of the family is Lindsay, a junior high child prodigy of sorts, who worries over everything, and often finds herself trying to keep her family functioning from day to day.The story is told from the alternating perspectives of Allegra, Mariah and Lindsay. Each woman is facing her own personal battles, along with trying to cope with life on a daily basis. I read a customer review of this book somewhere (I can't remember which website I read it on) and the reviewer wrote that this book was terrible, and that so many issues were raised which were never given any resolution. Having just finished the book, I would have to strongly disagree. In my opinion, all the issues were touched upon, and dealt with. If no answer was directly given, readers are at least left with the sense that the Moon family is going to triumph once again.

It is about four generations of women who have a cafe and all of the dynamics of their relationships with one another as well as the men in their lives. Lindsay was a wonderful character. I could not wait to see how her middle school science project turned out. Mariah, her mother, lost a job due to downsizing and I've been there, done that, so I could totally relate to her character. Mariah's mother, Allegra, was a lovable hippie and her mother, Bess, a rosary holding church goer trying desperately to save the soul of their cook, Simon, who was gay. This book had likable characters and humor in it as well as a great story line. It was truly an enjoyable read and I recommend it."}], "description": "After losing her teaching position at the local university, Mariah Moon will do anything to keep her gifted twelve-year-old daughter, Lindsay, in a prestigious private school -- which means moving in with her mother and grandmother in an apartment above The Owl & Moon Caf\ufffd.When her mother, Allegra, is diagnosed with leukemia, Mariah rises to the challenge of running the caf\ufffd mastering her mother's famous fudge and chatting up customers -- including a man who might just reawaken her heart.
