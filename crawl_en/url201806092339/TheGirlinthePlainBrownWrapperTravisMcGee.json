Helena is dying and asks Travis to check on her daughter Maureen who has gone completely nuts. Travis learns that Helena died before he got the letter, and even though he doubts there is anything he can do, he travels to see Maureen who is being cared for by her husband and sister.After visiting Maureen and talking with her family, Travis thinks she is being cared for as well as possible and is about to leave town. Before he can go, he gets sucked into a murder investigation of one of Maureen\u2019s doctors. Does the murder have something to do with Maureen\u2019s current condition?As always, you get an interesting character with McGee, and the mystery is intriguing, if a bit wonky. Unfortunately, the inherent sexism of these books written in the \u201860s is pretty awful. But this one is actually a bit better than the previous ones. Yes, every woman in the story is willing to submit to McGee\u2019s wily charms at the drop of a hat, and none of them seem to have a problem that can\u2019t be fixed with McGee\u2019s patented brand of sexual healing. However, they seem a little less like scatter brained props and more like actual characters this time."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"That's because we always want to know why. Not so much how and who and when. But why.\"- John D. MacDonald, the Girl in the Plain Brown WrapperOne of the better MacDonald novels I've read this year. He appears to be unable to escape the bizarrely sexualized, woman-in-peril, sex kitten clich\u00e9, BUT for a book that came just 15 years after Playboy and James Bond made their entrance into the Western consciousness, turning women into bunnies and well-oiled sex kittens, some roughness can be forgiven (not overlooked or excused). Generationally, it is understandable, if still hard to really tolerate for more than a couple pages at a time. Why do I read him if I can't stand MacDonald's attitude toward women? Because there is something there. Because I like his perspectives on a great deal more. Because he isn't just writing crime fiction, but doing a mini-exegesis on the American, male psyche of the 1960s and 1970s. And, each book seems just about to escape the confines of his highly marketable form of misogyny. The bright spot in this book, published in 1968, was his brutal (for the time) honesty about race as it intersected with commerce, law enforcement, sex, and justice.The dialogues between Travis and Lorette, a black maid at the hotel he is staying at, is almost worth the entire price of admission. I kept reminding myself that this book was MacDonald's 10th McGee novel and published in 1968. That was the year that Johnson passed the Civil Rights Act of 1968 (Fair Housing Act). It was written from the perspective of a white libertarian (Travis McGee) living in Florida. His perspective on race was refreshing and honest, given the time and place. It shows that we have made some strides as far as sex, and some strides with race too. Just not as many or as quickly as many would prefer."}, {"userName": "James Thane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483907-james-thane", "userReview": "As the tenth book in John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee series opens, McGee is once again called upon to restore a grieving widow to psychological and sexual health. The grateful woman, Helena Pearson, returns to her normal life, but several years later, she is dying of cancer and calls upon McGee for one last favor. Helena's daughter, Maurie, has become mysteriously suicidal and Helena would like McGee to diagnose the problem and find a solution.McGee dutifully journeys to Fort Courtney, Florida, where Maurie lives with her husband, Tom, a high-flying local developer. Maurie's younger sister, Bridget, is also in residence, helping Tom look after Maurie. Sadly, by the time McGee arrives, Helena has succumbed to her cancer and so McGee is left to feel his way through a very complicated situation if he's going to be of any help.As is usually the case in one of these novels, things get complicated in a big hurry. A number of folks seem to be very interested in McGee's arrival; a couple of people will have to die; everyone will be enormously confused and only McGee may be smart enough and devious enough to sort things out.Like all of the McGee novels, this one is obviously dated, and McGee spends a lot of time philosophizing about the world around him. There's not as much action in this book as in most of the others in the series--things are a bit more cerebral--and there's not a hulking, giant, Neanderthalish brute of an adversary as there often is. The climax beggars belief a bit, but still, it's a fun read and anyone who enjoys the series will certainly want to find this entry."}, {"userName": "Jeff ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12618229-jeff", "userReview": "It\u2019s been a long, long time since I last read a Travis McGee novel.

References to the Pill (Macdonald\u2019s caps, not mine), Walter Cronkite (kids, he was a network news anchor, back when that meant anything), and an antiquated take on sex and race stood out.He doesn\u2019t treat women \u201cbadly\u201d, it\u2019s just that he comes across as Travis, amateur sex therapist, the guy with the answer to every woman\u2019s problems because they dig him so much. The fact that the female characters are a mishmash of genre \u201ctypes\u201d doesn\u2019t help. When you\u2019ve read enough of this type of fiction, like I have, clich\u00e9s have a tendency to stick out.That said, McDonald does play with the detective/mystery conventions a little. There isn\u2019t a dead body until about two-fifths of the way into the book. McGee, for better or worse, goes into these inner monologues on occasion that aren\u2019t your standard mystery/detective fare.

There is a lot of elaborate back-story here, that may put off readers who want a murder on the first page, a fist fight on page two, and a car chase by page five; but John D. is at the absolute top of his game: the story he has to tell sucks me in and holds me. As usual, Travis goes shuffling and blundering into some potentially criminal situation driven by misguided loyalty or a debt he thinks he owes to someone; in this novel a dead woman. It isn\u2019t until page 59, when Travis is all set to give up on his foolish notion that anyone needs rescuing from anyone, when he discovers that someone has searched his hotel room: BAD GUY ALERT! My guess is I\u2019ve re-read this about 4 times over the years. By page 72 a man and woman try to drug Travis and question him at gunpoint. By page 103 Travis is questioned by two detectives\u2014because the woman half of the pair who tried to question him at gunpoint was found murdered, and Travis is the main suspect.I don\u2019t like the plot for BROWN WRAPPER, but I can\u2019t think of any way to improve anything. And BROWN has some of my all-time favorite scenes of Travis McGee dialogue. And the ending! Oh, baby! I absolutely LOVE the ending.What I want to know is how John D. MacDonald knew so much about human nature to write scenes that surprise me and awe me with secret knowledge about us critters called humans. Was he tapping random phone conversations? Was he privy to police interrogations? Was John D. listening into shrink/patient conversations? Oh, s***.

He was much younger than her and she wasn't looking for a new husband, just a good time. Which Travis was able to give her on his boat while taking her traveling. When she left after that summer of love, they kept in contact through mail, but never saw one another again. When Travis gets a letter from Helena telling him how she is terminally ill and how her eldest daughter is in a bad mental state since her second miscarriage he is shocked by how much the vital woman he knew so well and intimately is now so frail. He is out on a salvage job on his boat when Helena dies. When Travis gets home, he finds a letter from Helena's lawyer telling him he has been given $25,000 as a payment for a job he has done for her. The \"job\" is then described to him by her in a letter that came with the check. Helena wants Travis to help her daughter Maurie so she doesn't destroy herself. She has tried to commit suicide three times since her last miscarriage and Helena seems to think that Travis would be one that could get through to her and help her recover mentally from it all. What Travis finds after flying in to see the family that he once helped and loved is a scene that is more messed up than even Helena seemed to think it was. Is there more to Maurie's suicides than a depressed woman? As he is trying to make sense of the household she lives in he is almost killed by a couple who thinks he is there because of Maurie's husband Tom and his \"business\" ventures. This leads Travis to become friendly with the local cops and start an investigation of his own into the live of Tom. When he finds out about a link to a doctor who \"committed suicide\" with Tom, Travis is in way too deep to just turn and go home. He has to help find out what is going on. His feelings about helping only get stronger when the woman who tried to kill him is now murdered. What is going on in this messed up family and town? Did that doctor, who happened to be treating Maurie, really commit suicide like they say he did? Are the practices and medications being used on Maurie to \"treat her mental disorders\" really necessary and ethical? What has happened to this family that seemed so put together so many years ago? And can Travis really be of any help to any of them?I must say this book had a very slow and odd start to it. I almost put it down actually in those first chapters. I decided to push on though and I am glad that I did. It really turned into quite a good book with lots of mystery and things to think about as the plot thickened. I have read a few of the Travis McGee mysteries that were written after this book and I must say that my favorite part of any of them is the wonderful character of Travis McGee. He is a laid back kind of guy who just wants to help others in any way he can if he thinks he can. This is shown greatly in this book. He travels far from home and gets involved in a murder case and a dysfunctional family's affairs all because he was in love with the old mother of the family and because she asked him to help her family and daughters figure things out. The daughters of the late Helena are open to Travis being there to see them because they remember him helping them when their father died and remember that he was good friends with their Mom. Travis endures a lot in this book both physically and emotionally, but comes out the other end a new and better man. This book is well worth sticking with, no matter how the first chapters seem. After is gets moving it is full of family drama, action, adventure, murder, and mystery. I would recommend picking it up to read. The characters are great and the book/plot are very well developed.4/5 Stars!"}, {"userName": "Dave", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35045983-dave", "userReview": "Girl in the Plain Brown Wrapper is the tenth out of twenty-one Travis McGee novels. Although sometimes categorized as a mystery series, the McGee series may borrow some ideas from mysteries, but it is a series about as far from the standard PI genre as can be. McGee is not a PI. He\u2019s a salvage consultant. When someone loses something of value and the normal lawful means of getting it back are not sufficient, he figures out how to outfox the conmen and nets a fifty percent profit of the haul. He lives on a houseboat in the Bahai Mar Marina on the Florida Coast. Often, he confronts conmen, swindlers, and just mean ones, but he is about as unofficial and off-the-books as they come.This entry into the McGee legend follows some of the usual territory with an old flame looking up McGee and asking for his help, but there is nothing to salvage here, except perhaps a woman\u2019s life. He\u2019s asked by an old flame who he cruised with for a season after she was widowed and who has now died of cancer to look after one of her daughters, who is apparently suicidal. McGee isn\u2019t sure how he can go about this, but looks into it and stumbles on a nest of intrigue and con games and blackmailers.This novel has quite a bit less action than most the McGee books. Most of it is consumed with McGee sorting things out and logically deducing what is going on and who is who and what they want.What\u2019s really great about it isn\u2019t necessarily the mystery so much as how MacDonald describes people so that, even if you haven\u2019t met them, you know the type he is talking about.

John D. MacDonald\u2019s style is engaging and distinctive, his pacing and plotting marvelous. As someone who reads a lot of crime novels I can usually predict where a story is going, however, the twists and turns in this book kept me guessing. The ending, while not gloriously happy, was truly satisfying.My only quibble is the confusing opening chapter. The author supplies the directions and names of so many locations within the Florida Keys that they become confusing and therefore meaningless to anyone unfamiliar with the area.

Travis was in and out of bed with three women in the story with several other \"encounters\" that could have but didn't end up there. More interesting was the way that he uses his considerable sexual expertise to help the women characters overcome problems in their lives. Kind of a PI sex-therapist. Some of the dialogue felt very yesterday, and his view of women and of African-American culture was interesting for the era. He was enlightened by those standards but certainly not by ours.

In fact the onslaught of meticulously detailed\u2014or overwrought, depending on your view\u2014sex scenes early in the book makes it abundantly clear that McGee is nothing short of an Olympian shagger. Okay Okay the guy\u2019s supposedly uber-smooth and implacably attractive. But he\u2019s not cosmopolitan James Bond: he lives on a houseboat and plies his trade in sleepy backwaters.

The other thing I like about MacDonald is that not all his mysteries were murder mysteries, but often things dealing in monetary fraud, and the murders happen along the way as he's hunting lost and stolen money. He lessens this by making Travis McGee an amiable beach bum who specializes in helping people and recovering lost things.

I'll have to check out some more MacDonald (not to be confused with Ross McDonald, of Chandler's era and genre)."}, {"userName": "Drew", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4675538-drew", "userReview": "Best part of this book was MacDonald describing a character thus:\"...might have been too handsome without a certain irregularity about his features, a suggestion of a cowlicky, lumpy, aw shucks, early-Jimmy-Stewart flavor.\"Of course, finding out the reason that description is so apt would necessitate reading the book, which you can pretty much take or leave."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11351200-leslie", "userReview": "This 10th entry in the McGee series was fast-paced, a good suspense story.

comparatively shorter than macdonald's 'great' stories. this one took some time to \"get\" into it...there is that seemingly unrelated to the narrative beginning. joe and bobby and marine salvage, raising a boat with some sort of expanding foam. interesting, sure, but what were you doing there? macdonald? this is followed with a five- six-year flashback that brings helena into focus. many interesting gimmicks at work in the story...the \"dormed\"...some sort of device that brings blissful sleep to the wearer...a number of drugs designed to eliminate memory...couple with the old stand-by of greed and corruption through land and money deals. an okay story and there's a scene at a tree that is a tad disturbing...as is the phosphate mine deal. makes ya think, anyway...does me.

"GoodReads has had this on my \u201cCurrently Reading\u201d list since 2011. I will cop to being a slow reader, but come on! I actually just dropped out of touch with GR for a while, thus begins my housekeeping of the Currently Reading list.Several years back, I started reading John D. MacDonald\u2019s Travis McGee series from the beginning. MacDonald was a talented writer, but I\u2019ve enjoyed reading the McGee books as much for their blend of history lesson and sociology class as for the thriller elements. The thriller element here is convoluted, as McGee comes to the aid of the wife of an old friend. She is dying of cancer, and she winds up being the last person in the story to die of natural causes. The audacious plan McGee hatches to catch the bad guys is satisfying, and there\u2019s a wicked little twist at the end in which some extra justice is dispensed.Mid-story, MacDonald uses McGee as his mouthpiece to take on race relations in America circa 1968. McGee, a large, rough-looking white guy, is trying to get information out of an African-American woman who doesn\u2019t know him from Adam, and does not trust him right out of the gate:\u201cIt was all too familiar and all too frustrating. It is the black armor, a kind of listless vacuity, stubborn as an acre of mules. Okay, so they have had more than their fair share of grief from men of my outward stamp, big and white and muscular, sun-darkened and visibly battered. My outward type had knotted a lot of black skulls...burned crosses and people in season. They see just (my) outward look and they classify on that basis. I had to find my way past that black armor. Funny how it used to be easier. Suspicion used to be on an individual basis. Now, each one of us, black or white, is a symbol. The war is out in the open, and the skin color is a uniform. All the deep and basic similarities of the human condition are forgotten so that we can exaggerate the few differences that exist\u201d"}], "description": "With an introduction by CARL HIAASENJOHN D.
