I am completely awestruck by this book.A very well-written, unique and hauntingly Gothic story, with the enough amount of detailed descriptions of atmosphere and characters and beautiful references to some of the best literary works. This was my first Tiffany Reisz read and I can't wait to get my filthy hands on her other works now!Gwendolyn \"Gwen\" Ashby has left her job and home at Savannah, Georgia, and is now driving to Chicago, with every single thing she owns in this life in the trunk of the car. She\u2019s planning to crash at a friend\u2019s house for a while and find a brand new job as an English and Literature teacher. She has absolutely nobody left in life. Her parents have been dead for years and now her boyfriend Cary has left her to pursue his dream to teach in a village school in Africa. She is all alone, jobless and frankly, penniless too.She reaches Appalachian Mountains along her way and decides to take a break from driving. She goes into a pub, where she hears about an all-boys boarding school called Marshal School and learns from one of the waitresses that they\u2019re hiring new teachers. She thinks, what the hell, why not give it a try, what does she have to lose anyway, right?But Marshal School is nothing like she has expected\u2026\nWelcome to \"The William Marshal Academy\" !\n\u2026A heart-stoppingly beautiful old English castle that immediately takes Gwen\u2019s breath away. Distracted by it\u2019s beauty, Gwen gets startled by a deer in the woods and ends up having a serious car crash.When she awakes to the authoritative voice of a British man, mixed with some other young and eager male voices on the background, she finds herself in the quarters of a certain enigmatic gentleman, the Headmaster of the academy, Edwin Yorke.Headmaster Yorke is a tall, broad-shouldered and very handsome 40ish-year-old man, with black-grey hair and oh-God-so-sexy glasses that hide his no-doubt incredibly beautiful eyes. He is a true gentleman, and a rather old-fashioned one at that. \n\n\"You are living in the wrong time. You should have been born in the Regency era. You would have made a wonderful Mr. Darcy.\"\n\nOnce Gwen gets over her initial shock of coming face-to-face with the man in her dreams, she explains that she has been on her way to the academy to ask whether they may have a job opening as a teacher. Apparently, the English teacher Miss Muir has recently parted her ways with the school, so Headmaster Yorke and Gwen agree on a one-week trial period, to see if she is suitable for the job.The overwhelming and irrepressible attraction between the Headmaster and Gwen is palpable from the very start and eventually, Gwen finds herself shamelessly flirting with this extremely stoic man. After all, he was the one that called her \n\u201clovely\u201d\n not just once, not just twice, but THREE TIMES the first time they talked together, wasn\u2019t he?\n\nIf he was a king and the students his knights, surely he could use a lady in his court.~ GWEN\n\nBut the gentleman that he is, he denies her for a long time, pleading that it would be inappropriate when she is a teacher and he is the headmaster of a school full of fifteen and sixteen year old boys that he is supposed to be a role model to.\n\n\"You won't trick me that easily into drinking your tea of concupiscence, Miss Ashby.\"\"It was worth a shot.\"\n\nWith Gwen\u2019s unrelenting advances though, his control cracks and crumbles, freeing him to finally cave in\u2026 Just one sizzling hot kiss is enough to bind these two souls together and locking them inside each others hearts, with no key to be found ever again.But Edwin has dark secrets, secrets that might cost him of his first true love that he has waited too long for\u2026\n\n\"You\u2019ll stay, won\u2019t you? No matter what happens? You\u2019ll stay here with me? I shouldn't ask you to stay. You don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re giving up. But please\u2026\"\"I\u2019ll stay.\"\n\nThe smart and sassy Gwen and the old-fashioned gentlemanly Edwin created one of the most captivating and perfect love stories I\u2019ve ever read. Edwin is so charming and funny without trying.\n\n\"You're very handsome and charming when you're being overbearing and disdainful.\"\"Then I shall endeavor to be less overbearing and disdainful in the future.\"\"Pity.\"\n\nHe is even a perfect gentleman in bed!\n\n\"You can come whenever you want,\" she said between ragged breaths. \"You don't have to wait for me.\"\"Ladies first.\"\n\nAll students of the academy are simply adorable! I wanted to hug each and every one of them to death for their extreme cuteness! Plus, I loved the way T. Reisz touched some very controversial social issues through them.\nI RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE!\nJust remember to expect the unexpected.You won\u2019t see what\u2019s coming at the end\u2026\n\n\"Fortius quam fraternitas nullum est vinculum.\"meaning...\"There is no bond stronger than brotherhood.\""}, {"userName": "Sandy \u10e6Coffee Addict Books\u10e6", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28806659-sandy-coffee-addict-books", "userReview": "\"4.5 tea stars\"TR did it again!!!! apparently she can write any genre and excel in it, this woman has a way with surprising her readers with her 'WTF ending' because this was a complete unexpected unpredictable shocking ending for such a short story and I loved it!!Gwen Ashby left behind her old life in Georgia after her long term boyfriend dumps her to teach in a village school in Africa, with no family and friends, she packs ups everything she owns (which is nothing much) and leaves to Chicago in search of a new job but she stops at a diner and learns about the job vacancy for teaching position in Marshal School situated in middle of the woods at Appalachian Mountains, she wants to try her luck there as she doesn\u2019t have a planned schedule ahead of her and drives to the mountains, expecting to see a industrial school she is taken aback by sight of English Castle rising over moss-covered stone walls, enchanted by its beauty she gets distracted and crashes her car to avoid knocking down the deer.Gwen wakes up finding herself in a strange old-fashioned room and there she meets a tall, broad-shouldered black haired Englishman wearing eyeglasses in other words Edwin Yorke, Headmaster of \u201c The William Marshal Academy\u201d. A school so unique with breath taking view where students are well mannered, highly intelligent and very humble. So when Gwen is offered a temporary job of teaching English literature she gladly accepts it.\u201cThis school was weird, but it was a good kind of weird. Her kind of weird.\u201dOnce she becomes a part of the Marshal academy she starts loving the peacefulness of the institution which has no connection to the outside world and no trace of modern technology where students and teachers share a strong bonding and respect for one another, and then there\u2019s the handsome Headmaster she can\u2019t stop thinking of, his very enigmatic demeanor stirs a buried passion within her.When he was glaring, he looked very handsome. When he wasn\u2019t glaring...well, he probably should start glaring again or Gwen was going to have that sex-on-a-desk fantasy again.Edwin being a gentleman denies her advances but he too falls for her witty charm, a woman who penetrates the walls he built around his stoic personality. In matter of two weeks Gwen is living a life she dreamt of, a man who loves her, students who adores her and place so beautiful that she soon decides to stay there forever.\u201cYou\u2019ll stay, won\u2019t you? No matter what happens? You\u2019ll stay here with me? I shouldn't ask you to stay. You don\u2019t even know what you\u2019re giving up. But please...\u201d\"I\u2019ll stay.\"Though she loves the place and people residing in it, she can\u2019t ignore the strangeness lurking in every corner of this place. She\u2019s adamant on getting to the bottom of this mystery. Edwin tries very hard to protect the secret from her; the very secret if revealed changes the course of their lives and they might lose Gwen forever.\u201cWhat was he hiding? And why was he hiding it?\u201dTiffany Reisz is an amazing storyteller, even if this was a short read there's great amount of information making it a perfect story and it was hell of a perfect story with great description of the places and characters whom you connect so strongly you keep missing thinking about them long after you\u2019ve finished it. She weaved the story with her usual signature of overbearing chivalrous fluent in gazillion language Hero and sassy, witty and smart heroine with great amount of passion and lot of references to the Classic English literature's of all times. I loved the banters, the boys were so adorable and characters lovable making this a captivating story and the mystery leading to the ending was a total PAGE TURNER!!P.S: If it was not for my bestie Eda (Whom I love even more now :p), this book would've gone unnoticed in my ever growing TBR pile, So Thank you babe for rec\u2019ing and providing me with the copy. muahhhhhh! :D"}, {"userName": "J *deep in the heart of Texas*", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9072385-j-deep-in-the-heart-of-texas", "userReview": "4.5 Stars!!Yup.....that's all you're getting from me!

Stern, enigmatic Edwin Yorke simmers with a heat Gwen longs to unleash. But Edwin knows all too well that forbidden love can end in tragedy\u2026.\nWhat can I say, I loved The Headmaster, it had a little bit of everything; intrigue, mystery, passion, sass, class and laughs. Tiffany Reisz can pretty much make any one desirable, while Edwin is no Soren, he holds his own in the distinguished controlled overbearing class. Gwen is a female who is full of passion and compassion in everything she did with everyone she encountered. \n\n\u201cPlay hard to get all you want,\u201d she said after he\u2019d disappeared from view. \u201cBut you will be drinking tea with me before this week is over.\u201d \n\nRight off the bat there was chemistry between the two, and while Gwen was more open in her interest, there was no denying the feeling was mutual.

Unless he didn\u2019t want to.\n\nI can't tell you what exactly it was about this read that did it for me, I felt as enchanted with this the school as Gwen. The Headmaster and the boys, they were all so endearing and just made you want to be a part of their little world. The banter between the characters are just to precious to miss, it brought everything to life. \n\nFor Edwin... For the boys. For the love of teaching and the love of learning and the love of the life she\u2019d been granted here like a wish she didn\u2019t remember making. It was a wish. It was a dream. It was everything she\u2019d wanted and hadn\u2019t had the courage to ask for.\n\nWith twists and turns along the way you never would guess where it is all heading... you just gotta sit back and enjoy the story for what it is. \u2764\u2764\u2764Buddy Read with my Haven Hotties."}, {"userName": "Allison \u2764\ufe0fWill Never Conquer Her TBR\u2764\ufe0f", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9080319-allison-will-never-conquer-her-tbr", "userReview": "4.5 Crazy Ass Stars!\nNo? Well, ladies and gentlemen, The Headmaster will be your first. It will seriously rock your world!\nGwendolyn Ashby, on a road trip to Chicago to find work as a teacher, stumbles upon Marshall School, an old all-boys academy. Deeply seated in the woods, looking like a historical French chateau, she's mesmerized. Swerving to avoid a deer, she crashes her car into one of the school buildings. She wakes to find herself ensconced within the living quarters of the headmaster. Headmaster Edwin Yorke, a proper (albeit stiff) English gentleman, provides Gwen care while she recovers from a head injury. He's refined, almost stoic...combined with Gwen's snarky dry humor, provided a fair amount of comedy relief.\n\u201cSo you do think I\u2019m lovely?\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve seen worse.\u201d\u201cI appreciate the miserable attempt at a compliment, Headmaster.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re most welcome, Miss Ashby.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll try to find some burlap bags\u201dOr...\u201cMiss Ashby.\u201d\u201cYou can call me Gwen,\u201d she said.\u201cI don\u2019t like that name,\u201d he replied coldly.\u201cWould you like to change it?\u201dHe narrowed his eyes at her.\u201cI suppose I could call you Gwendolyn?\u201d\u201cYou can,\u201d she said. \u201cGwendolyn Anne Ashby, at your service.\u201d\u201cMiss Ashby it is, then.\u201d\nGwen is immediately drawn to the school and the prefect-gentleman teen boys who reside here. She offers her help in teaching English Literature, replacing the mysterious Miss Muir who departed a while back. Gwen is uber drawn to this prim and proper Headmaster. She propositions him on more then one occasion (hysterically so). He, always being the controlled gentleman, denies her advances. He's the head of a very distinguished school...and the role model to find young men (who, by the way, were so stinking cute). But beneath his starched exterior, his control is crumbling...he wants her. It doesn't take long for him to cave...\nHoly cow! Mistress Reisz doesn't fail us on the FUCKHOT sex scenes. Headmaster Edwin kind of reminds me of one of her other...rather...reserved...controlled...panty-melting heroes. (who shall remain nameless but we all know who he is. I'd be a sinner to tell).The Headmaster is not what you think. It's a crazy ride. I'm not going to spoil it. Avoid reading a lot of reviews. Just experience it. With Halloween upon us, this is a great, rather ghostly erotic tale. Tiffany Reisz is the master at weaving a story that heats up the pages with eroticism, makes us laugh with witty banter, provides a hero with mysterious sexual prowess...and leaves us with a complete mindfuck we didn't see coming. Bravo! So happy I picked this up!*** At the time I read this, it was not tagged PNR. I don't read PNR and I wouldn't say this is such. It's a tad ghostly but in a entertaining, non-creepy, non-scary way. If I liked it, it's uber mild.The Headmaster is part of an E-Shivers boxed set of four ghoulish novellas.

It wasn't hard to figure out. But...I won't do it. This is the perfect (shorter) romance story for Halloween. It has just enough of a spooky element to qualify as paranormal, but not enough to turn off contemporary romance readers. The story itself reads like a contemporary with a slight twist. I could/should throw out the instalove warning. It's here in all its overbearing glory. However, the instalove makes sense in this instance, when we're not dealing with a full book. You have to get in and get out in less pages, hence the sped-up romance. Plus, the \"twist\" makes the instalove element stronger in a good way. If the \"twist\" hadn't been part of the story, I don't think I would have enjoyed the read nearly as much. A lot of the character behavior was bordering on odd until the twist brought the story full circle and made you want to root for the characters, which I appreciated.As usual, Reisz writes interesting characters peppered with zany character quirks who like to engage in entertaining banter. I felt like the characters were somewhat recycled in parts from other characters of hers I've read in the past but it wasn't enough to deter me. The headmaster reminded me of a stuffier/more proper version of Zach and Nora's pushiness was ever-present in Gwen. But...there was enough of a change that I was able to soon move past any similarities and allow myself to fall into the story. The setting was its own character, which is something I tend to love. If a book is able to make me feel like I can picture the character's surroundings, I find myself that much more invested. I was easily able to imagine the creepy, elegant, and regal school. It's not quite Hogwarts but I still wanted to be there, even so.If you're looking for a short romance with a dash of mystery and love, as people are brought together through a strong hand of destiny, I'd definitely say to give this a go."}, {"userName": "Elle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31899511-elle", "userReview": "3.5* SHIVERS STARS!!I read anything from Tiffany Reisz. End of. The Headmaster has different aura but still the same writing. I never expect that Ms. Reisz could pull this off brilliantly. With Gothic theme and mysterious aura, the story managed to grip me until the end.Gwen Ashby is undergraduate student who leave her town to Chicago for a job vacancy. In her trip, she has an accident. She awakes in Marshal Academy who treated her nicely. It's all boy school and Gwen is the only woman in there. Edwin Yorke is the headmaster of Marshal Academy. He's a dedicated person and love all the children. Since the academy quite remote, she couldn't leave from there and need to wait. When she got the job as a temporary teacher, the mystery begins.Gwen and Edwin has mysterious persona and I ended up couldn't understand them at first. Honestly, Gwen is a mediocre heroine. Otherwise, Edwin is the one who intrigued me. He's old fashioned and traditional. But quite handsome in his age. Edwin has some hardship in his past that couldn't allow Gwen to close to her even she's become more persuasive. They're trying to build the chemistry with slowly but sure. When Edwin's past come to light, I finally understand. I loved how the seduction in action for Edwin.I haven't read a story like this before. It was slow paced and almost bored me. When Gwen experience all the night events, I could feel something was wrong. Damn Gothic ambiance. Boo!! Honestly, it was hard to review this without any spoiler. LOL! But despite my issues, The Headmaster was a great read for romance with mysterious vibe. Well written until the end! The ending was just un-freaking-believable with twists and turns.

I am sad to admit that I was bored while reading this story. I saw hero as some weird caricatural version of Mr. Darcy instead of charming gentleman that author was probably aiming for. However, it all \"clicked\" in the last (quite unexpected) chapter. But instead of being shocked, I personally felt very repulsed by it all. Note that this is purely my subjective opinion.

PERFECTION!

This book is... WOW. I loved every moment of it. I was completely enthralled by the amount of detail that went into the writing of this novel\u2014 the diverse cast of characters, the artistic & architectural details... but most of all, the numerous & in depth references to literature. Ivanhoe, Great Expectations, Jane Eyre, A Midsummer's Night Dream.... Each of these revered pieces of classical literature were so intricately & astutely woven into the plot. The Headmaster is the perfect book for anyone who loves the classics & contemporary literature in equal measure. It's also a novel suitable for readers who are \"deep thinkers.\" It's only 125 pages long, but it took me quite a while to get through it since I was intent on soaking up every last detail. I re-read & analyzed the references to literature. I paid extra attention to the Latin phrases & tried to recall *if* I remember anything from my 3 years of high school Latin. In short, I took the time to bask in the writing\u2014 writing which was nothing short of brilliant!If you are planning on reading this novel, I URGE you to forego reading the synopsis/blurb, & I also urge you to stay away from all spoilers. Your reading experience will be enhanced if you go into the novel with a clear & unadulterated mind.I DID take 0.25 stars away from this novel for a few typographical errors. I realize that they're \"only typos.\" HOWEVER, when a novel is crafted as exquisitely as this one, the typos are blemishes on what could have been sheer perfection.As for author Tiffany Reisz, I just have to say that:Iaminawe.I absolutely ADORE Tiffany Reisz. I realize that her books are not for everyone. However, whenever I pick up a Tiffany Reisz novel or novella, I'm always certain of a few things: 1) The novel or novella is going to be well-written. There won't be any grammatical mistakes (and only a few, if any, typographical errors). The book will be written at an adult reading-level, & it will be suitable for ADULTS. There won't be a plethora of childish expressions such as \"Totes-ma-goats,\" \"Holy granola bar\" or \"Holy shit for Saturday dinner\"... and there won't be repetitive use of the expression \"Oh Lawd.\" (Yes, JLA. I'm talking to you).2) The novel or novella will be a unique work of fiction. Unilike the vast majority of authors in this particular genre, Reisz isn't merely recycling her past work & attempting to package it as a new novel. (Yes, Abbi Glines. I'm talking to you).3) The novel or novella will have significant undertones & themes. In her novels, Reisz touches on a number of hot-button issues\u2014 issues such as human rights, female liberation, social tolerance, civil rights, civic duty & honor. Reisz approaches these issues in a manner that is subtle. She isn't preachy or overbearing. Instead, she expertly blends these points into the storyline. So in addition to all of the kinky f*ckery, there's also an important, underlying societal message. Her books are fun & yet profound.*4.75/5 stars**** As many of you know, I've been pretty unlucky in the reading department as of late. Over the past two months, I've given the vast majority of the novels that I've read either 1 or 2 stars. I was growing weary of the perpetual disappointment that I felt after finishing (what I considered to be) mediocre or subpar reads... and I was considering taking a break from reading altogether. Therefore, I owe a HUGE \"Thank You\" to Amanda for recommending The Headmaster to me... and for, in effect, rescuing my sanity, as well as my love for reading. :)"}, {"userName": "Kim Bailey", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17747245-kim-bailey", "userReview": "3.5 StarsThis story is well written.

Gwen Ashby ends up at the Marshal School for boys by chance, looking for a teaching job. When she lays eyes on Edwin Yorke the incredibly handsome Headmaster, she knows she needs to do whatever she can to land the job and possibly the Headmaster too.\nHer attraction to Headmaster Yorke had been instantaneous, overwhelming and irrepressible. She\u2019d never seen a more attractive man in her life. Even his rudeness endeared her to him. The more he pretended to dislike her, the more she adored him.\nYes, there\u2019s an insta-love factor at play here, but it didn\u2019t both me\u2013 what do you expect from a novella this short? I just thought it was so well done. The banter between the two was phenomenal. Gwen is sweet yet feisty and Edwin is proper and direct, but together their sarcasm and back and forth is just pure gold. I found myself laughing and smiling a lot while reading this.\n \u201cCome with me to my office, Miss Ashby.\u201d \u201cYes, I will. Thanks for asking.\u201d He arched his eyebrow at her. \u201cI was pretending you asked me, instead of ordering me.\u201d \u201cBut you are coming to my office.\u201d \u201cYes, since you asked so nicely.\u201d\nInevitably Gwen and Edwin become lovers and we get plenty of steamy moments between them, but there\u2019s more than that. There\u2019s a mysterious feel throughout the story and at times you know there\u2019s something eerie going on behind castle-like walls of Marshall School. I must mention how great the boys of the school are, they played such a huge part even in their brief moments and added so much depth to the story.I really enjoyed this one. It was short, but managed to make me like and care about the characters. The setting and mystery were an added bonus to the romance and there\u2019s a twist that makes things even a bit more interesting. Definitely glad I picked this one up. \n\u201dYou\u2019ll stay, won\u2019t you? No matter what happens?

Even The Bride who roams the school is reminiscent of the Mad Woman in the Attic.But that\u2019s just superficially what this story is about. The last chapter changed my whole perspective and I can just think: brilliantly done!Tiffany Reisz is an excellent writer, that\u2019s a fact \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to say I\u2019m tired of Original Sinners, but I was more than ready for her to write something else, something different. And she sure proved she can. The Headmaster was a true Gothic story and I loved it.

It felt very atmospheric and a little bit creepy. Instead of the story being focused on the students, like boarding school settings usually do, this is a romance focused on the adults: The Headmaster and the new teacher. Gwen is immediately attracted to Edwin the very proper and a bit old-fashioned Headmaster, and the feeling is mutual even if he does fight it a little. Clandestine and steamy rendezvous (mustn't corrupt the kiddies, lol!) lead to deeper feelings and an intense connection. Strange events unsettle Gwen, and even though Edwin knows what's behind these occurrences he's reluctant to share. Can they overcome whatever sinister secrets may lurk at Marshall School? There's a bit of a spooky mystery mixed in with a twist that you may or may not guess.
