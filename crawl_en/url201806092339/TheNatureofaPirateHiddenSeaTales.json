I love the characters, from Sophie\u2019s headstrong intelligence to Garland\u2019s reserved politeness to Verena\u2019s desire to prove herself. They\u2019re whole people, able to stand on their own and tell their own stories. I love the cultures built in the flooded world. I love the little linguistic quirks that get thrown in, pieces of a puzzle to solve. Dellamonica is a fantastically skilled writer, at the top of her game, and I can\u2019t imagine her coming down from those heights any time soon. Do yourself a favour and pick up this series soon if you haven\u2019t already. It\u2019s absolutely worth the time you\u2019ll spend reading it."}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29609954-james", "userReview": "While billed as a trilogy, this series has more room to run. While the ending is not a cliffhanger, it's has lots of unresolved mysteries. Also the romance aspect kicks in with an Austenisque situation where Sophie must be engaged to be considered an adult. Is she being manipulated by her sociopathic, control freak father? A fun read."}, {"userName": "Danya", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2582316-danya", "userReview": "3.5 starsSophie Hansa was adopted as a baby and never knew her biological parents, for good reason: they belong to another world. Stormwrack is similar to earth during the Age of Sail, but with significantly less land mass\u2026and magic. Governed by the Fleet, a floating city comprised of hundreds of ships, Stormwrack is a place where people\u2019s names are powerful ingredients in working spells or intentions; and it\u2019s also a place where Sophie\u2019s knowledge of science is scorned. Sucked into Stormwrack against her will, Sophie gradually begins to fall in love with her biological parents\u2019 home world and takes on a series of missions there.Secretive, deeply politically divided, and bound by rules of etiquette that Sophie considers old fashioned, Stormwrack is a fascinating world that I\u2019ve really enjoyed learning about throughout the series. In THE NATURE OF A PIRATE, Dellamonica delves more deeply into the particulars of Stormwrack\u2019s various cultures and practices, most notably the slave trade. Understandably, the slave trade is a bitter pill to swallow for both Sophie and her brother Bram (many Stormwrackers feel the same) but it plays a large role in the social hierarchy of Stormwrack. The siblings get up close and personal with slavers in this book, and the results are pretty spectacular\u2026to say the least!Sophie also connects more deeply with her biological family and the Verdanni half of her heritage in THE NATURE OF A PIRATE, which was a treat to read about. The Verdanni are a powerful people in Stormwrack: they lay claim to one of the largest landmasses on Stormwrack and their agricultural practices have made them quite wealth. A matriarchal people, the Verdanni are ruled by the Allmother and celebrate women \u2013 but they also expect a lot from them. This means that Sophie\u2019s relatives Beatrice, Verena, and Annela are pretty badass ladies who also have giant chips on their shoulders\u2026much like Sophie herself.The character growth in THE NATURE OF A PIRATE is absolutely phenomenal, and as the star of the show, Sophie has really come into her own throughout the series. She\u2019s more confident in her own abilities and intellect, more sure of her place in her family (both adopted and biological), and she\u2019s also more experienced in the ways of Stormwrackers. I\u2019ve also really enjoyed seeing Bram, Sophie\u2019s brother, grow more assertive and stand up to Sophie when he thinks his big sister is trying to walk all over him. Of course, I\u2019m also biased because Bram\u2019s gay and y\u2019all know I love a queer character\u2026 But he is really cool, I promise!With a satisfying yet slightly open-ended conclusion, THE NATURE OF A PIRATE is a strong instalment in a solid series about magic, family, finding yourself, and \u2013 of course \u2013 sailing. If you like books with fantastic PoC and queer representation, or you\u2019re hoping to read more stories set at sea, then I recommend the Hidden Sea Tales series."}, {"userName": "Forestofglory", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4456637-forestofglory", "userReview": "I didn't like this one quite as much as the rest of the series. There was less science, and almost no ecology, an aspect I loved in previous books. Also I was hoping for more explanation of the big world building mysteries than we got. Still Sophie is great character and I was glad to spend some more time with her and see the end of her story arc."}, {"userName": "Michele", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9373341-michele", "userReview": "This was a thrill read from first to last..."}, {"userName": "Ari", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43431845-ari", "userReview": "So it took me the longest time to get into this book, and I couldn't figure out why I wasn't clicking with the characters or why I was so confused by where the characters were at the beginning of the book, and then I did find my groove with it and then I finished it and turned it over, and then it turned out that I had gone from book 1 to book 3 without stopping at the second book in this trilogy along the waySo........................whoops, A.M. Dellamonica, I bungled that one pretty goodBy the end I did get really into it, and now I want to reread the trilogy as a whole, to make up for missing #2, and because when reading #1 I do remember I never quite clicked with the characters (which surprised me because I love fiction about siblings!!) or the setting (I think I just had a hard time keeping track of the details), but now that this book got its hooks in me I think I'll have a better time.I love all the family stuff in this book-- the thorny half-sibling step-sibling step-parent estranged-cousin loving-but-resentful-sibling shit. Sophie with Bram, with Verena, with Cly-- those were some of my favourite scenes. I love Sophie with Garland, too -- I had to get up and walk around a bit at one scene with them near the end, which is how you know a romance is effective. The ending and its tone worked so well for me too.One thing that surprised me about this series and is maybe why it took me forever to find my groove with it is Sophie and Bram's... scientific curiosity about this magical world: their determination to figure it out, and not figure it out in terms of the magic it uses, as happens in so many Oh I'm A Regular Person And Oh What Is This Fantastical Magical Realm I Have Stumbled Into stories, where the main characters find power by learning the rules that realm plays by (and breaking them as necessary with their outsiders' POV), but by bringing the scientific method to the magic world-- to catalogue, to test for DNA, to look at fossil records, to try to find where and what this magic world is and how it's connected to the regular world, to bring your DSLR to Narnia and document the sea serpents' mating habits. It's so interesting and it's such a good take on it, and I think its newness is what threw me-- I was expecting that Harry Potter pattern and never got it.So I definitely want to reread the series, and I'm sure I'll like it all the better when I'm not fighting against its core just out of sheer genre confusion, and when I actually remember to read the books in order.:B"}, {"userName": "Clay Kallam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/961119-clay-kallam", "userReview": "So \u201cThe Nature of a Pirate\u201d (Tor, $28.99, 364 pages) was intriguing enough that I decided to jump in on a volume three (after trying to catch up by reading reviews of the first two books of the Hidden Sea Tales). The move was successful enough that I enjoyed the book and didn\u2019t feel too left out.The setup is similar to Roger Zelazny\u2019s Chronicles of Amber, for those readers of a certain age out there, in that there is an alternate world that is much different from modern day Earth. Sophie Hansa makes the trip to Stormwrack, which is a version of Earth covered almost entirely by ocean. That means much of the action takes place at sea, and since Hansa was a marine videographer and biologist in the 21st century, her skills fit right in.A.M. Dellamonica does a nice job of world building, positing a civilization that discourages curiosity, and that contains a wide variety of small nations that swing from cooperation to competition. The presence of significant magic and that lack of curiosity has led to a culture not that impressed with science or logical thinking, which gives Hansa an advantage as she tries to navigate her way, figuratively and literally, through this new world.There are plots and subplots aplenty, and though the protagonist is sometimes annoying, it\u2019s a fun ride. As always, though, it\u2019s best to start with volume one, which in this case is \u201cChild of the Hidden Sea.\u201d And it\u2019s also possible there might be a volume four, as Dellamonica left the door open more than a sliver at the end of \u201cThe Nature of a Pirate.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Karen Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15419740-karen-rebecca", "userReview": "This trilogy started out slow for me (caveat: I have the attention span of a squirrel when I'm battling depression, which is always) but by the third book had built into a cherished favorite. I grabbed this as soon as I could and devoured it as fast as I could. I've become very fond of the characters, the world, and where the books are going in the big scheme of things. It goes to show that some series need a few books to really establish the world and start blooming.. and are worth the stick with it time. So thankful there are publishers willing to make that commitment to these kind of authors, that not all publishers remain short sighted on immediate returns. I've discovered these types of stories are often the best in the long term. I can't help compare this development style to other series that started out so immediately amazing (Wheel of Time, cough cough) and got so top heavy, I lost interest about the same time the author realized he could sit back and milk the world and the plot and draw the books out into perpetuity--have you ever seen taffy made or caramels being pulled? That's just disrespect for your reader. In this reader's humble opinion. This series is not like that. It's like coming home every few months to a close friend who has *the best* stories and is nice enough to invite you over for a chat in front of the fireplace with wine and dinner and a little chocolate something later because it's the wee hours before you have to stagger on home. That is what this series is like. Keep on writing Alyx!"}, {"userName": "Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3349617-lindsey", "userReview": "A fun, clever addition to a fun series. I continued to enjoy the scientist-as-MC conceit and found myself missing Verena's interactions with Sophie (although Sophie and Bram was always solid). I still felt like Parrish was a bit 2D but he and Sophie had some good scenes in the later half. As before, I really enjoyed Cly (mostly because Sophie is so very judgmental and, while you don't love him, he's not really evil) and Beatrice (whom we get a little extra glimpse of through several other characters).Okay, plot. More \"who's plotting against the Cessation\" but I'm not tired of it yet. This one stepped it up a bit regarding what Sophie does and doesn't know about how magic works. This \"whodunit\" tied into the other two books neatly but further advanced our view of Stormwrack and its inhabitants. It also neatly answered a couple of big series question, although we didn't get much further than an answer that begged more questions.I very much want to read the related short stories now and also strongly hope that Dellamonica will be returning at the least to this world, if not also these characters."}, {"userName": "Aspen Junge", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4737224-aspen-junge", "userReview": "So what is a scientist with an insatiable curiosity, visiting a fantasy seafaring world, do to keep herself on the right side of the powers that be?

Sometimes it\u2019s helpful, as when she is looking for clues, sometimes she\u2019s just spinning her wheels and can\u2019t figure out who to trust.

I am always amazed at the unexpected places things go in this series. The characters are awesome\u2014the whole aspect of Sophie being inscribed at birth added a real twist to her already trying to figure out her identity. I love the whole idea of inscriptions, and that Bram is studying them. Introducing 19th Century fingerprinting techniques in was a really cool idea. The frights were genuinely freaky. The political subtext and subtleties between the nations is so well done, as is the mystery of who was responsible for Gale\u2019s death (TBD?).

It's actually kind of nice; leaves a lot up for further exploration and speculation within a fandom, if there is a fandom for Stormwrack. idk, I haven't really looked... but I might have to.

The science-focus has shifted away from biology and toward forensics, which is fine, though since the former is perhaps underrepresented in SFF compared to the latter I confess to being ever so slightly disappointed. I was also quite surprised by how much was left unresolved at the end of the book. The main thrust had a satisfying resolution, yes, but there would still be a lot left to explore in another book or two.The worldbuilding remains the absolute star of the book. This is just a cool setting, and I want more in it.

They need to advance the plots that have kept readers entranced for two books, and to tie up as many loose ends as possible.

This series seems designed specifically for me, hitting a bunch of my favourite conventions: portal fiction, pirates, secret families, intrigue, magic. Still, while I enjoyed all three books, they never quite resonated with me the way I expected them too. Sophie as a main character had an interesting progression, trying to find her place and reconcile two very different worlds, but some of her decisions also rang quite false to me. I also had to laugh during the sex scene; the language was, shall we say, purple, which felt especially out of place when sandwiched between Dellamonica's otherwise very practical writing style. Still, the magic system in Stormwrack remains fascinating, and I particularly liked the description of how mermaids are made and the religious aspects introduced in this book. I did also like how the mystery came together in the end, enough to resolve the story, but also leave room for future adventures."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31518922-jen", "userReview": "Upon finishing this book, I went to the Goodreads reviews and said, \"wait, what? This was the end of the series?\" and sure enough, in the acknowledgements I saw that this was indeed a trilogy. There was definitely room for more, because while the book reached a good wrapping up point, there still seemed to be a lot of questions to be resolved. Then again, that kind of slightly messy ending is a bit like real life; there are always more questions and more things to be happening. Sophie has a future, in a way that characters in other book series don't always seem to have.This book has Sophie trying to set up her forensic science institute and trying to figure out what to do with a prisoner who turns out to have some complicated motivations for his destructive actions in a previous book. In the process, we get some interesting answers to longstanding questions in the book (such as whether this portal world involves time travel to far future Earth or travel to a parallel universe) and some good character and relationship development, most notably with Cly.All in all, this was a fun book in a fun series."}, {"userName": "Paula", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13430735-paula", "userReview": "Thanks to Goodreads and Tor/Forge for a free copy of this book. The Nature of a Pirate is the story of Marine videographer and biologist Sophie Hanna and her adventures on the strange world of Stormwrack. Fantasy is not one of my favourite genres but I loved that Sophie is such a strong female character and became invested in her character. There is a lot of exciting and innovative action in this book. For instance, it will be a long time before I get the images of the merman transformation out of my head. The novel is well written, very descriptive with lots of action such that at times, I had a hard time putting it down. So why only 3 stars? Well, this book is the 3rd and final book in the Stormwrack series and I found it a bit confusing in parts.
