Because, if you do, you will be denying yourself the pleasure that only comes from the intimate knowledge gained in understanding the arc of life of Britain\u2019s greatest (fictional) warrior, Uhtred of Bebbanburg.A fragile peace governs the kingdoms of Wessex, East Anglia, under the rule of the late King Alfred\u2019s son, King Edward, and Mercia, under his daughter Aethelflaed. Utred\u2019s son-in-law, Sigtryggr, has the kingship of Northumbria (the remaining pagan portion of the future England). It is this last piece that has Utred, for the first time in decades, allied with pagans who worship Odin rather than the Saxons who worship \u201cthe nailed god.\u201d It has also raised his hopes of overcoming his cousin and reclaiming Bebbanburg. Now, at this particular time with so much in the balance there are opportunities for wealth and power that few can resist. Will Uhtred prevail? Can he do so and keep his oath to Aethelflaed? Can he secure Northumbria for his daughter and son-in-law? How much of a chance do the Danes and Norse have against an increasingly powerful Saxon alliance?Cornwell could be content with continuing to crank out these books knowing that they have a vast readership and a lot of people who enjoy reading any historical novel in this period of England\u2019s development. But he is not satisfied to give us a couple hundred pages of battles and intrigue. No, this may be his best book of the series.Why? Because it is a crafty story filled with words and events that illuminate human lives (even if some are fictional). The tension is there from the start as Uhtred and most of his \u201cwolf pack\u201d shadow a group of three ships making their way up the east coast of England to Bebbanburg. They are there to help Uhtred\u2019s cousin (the present Lord of Bebbanburg) with food and fighters to relieve the siege of Constantin, King of the Scots. No one can successfully attack the fortress of Bebbanburg but Constantin believes that he can starve them into submission before the following spring. Uhtred understands that this means his window of opportunity is very limited. If Constantin is successful, Uhtred will never be able to reclaim his birthright.Left virtually free to create this canvas, Cornwell gives us a detailed picture of the politics and duplicity of the various factions Scotland, East Anglia, Wessex, Mercia and Northumbria. Uhtred is bold and crafty and goes on hunches that are usually, but not always correct. His reputation often brings fear and anger to his encounters with other lords. All of this creates a true \u201cpage-turner\u201d as multiple and overlapping plots play out. But what becomes my true delight is the depth with which Cornwell peoples this novel. It isn\u2019t just the lords and warriors, but the boatmen, the innkeepers, the wives and whores whose presence deepens the whole experience. And, for a story so steeped in battle (with all its intricacies described) there is an abundance of humorous situations that help to fill-out the picture.I cannot say much more without spoiling one or more elements of Cornwell\u2019s deft plot. For those, like me who enjoy this historical stuff, you will not be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Lucia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8837962-lucia", "userReview": "Spectacular addition to series!

Bernard Cornwell brought 9th and 10th century England alive for me.* Unforgettable narrator. Uhtred of Bebbanburg is unapologetic and ruthless yet lovable and admiration worthy character with brilliant military strategic mind. He is a true hero!* Complex and fascinating side characters that you will love to come back to.* Constant philosophical battle between paganism and Christianity that depicts given period precisely.* Well thought-out storyline and twists.* War and fight scenes are chillingly realistic. I really felt like I was there with Uhtred, fighting every new enemy or being part of countless shield wars.All in all, The Warrior Chronicles/Saxon Stories series (all 10 available books) is spectacular story with spectacular writing. It is one of the best historical fiction stories I have ever read and it is the perfect example of how to write engaging historical fiction series that never get boring or predictable!Moreover, I loved author\u2019s note at the end of every book where author explained which parts were based on historical facts and which parts of his novel he made up.

We finally get some good plot progress in this book however. I liked it more than its predecessor but since War of the Wolf is scheduled to come out later this year the series will be at at 11 books, when I think it might have better to end with 10.I love Uthred and Finnan and \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d and all the rest, but I'm ready for a conclusion. Uthred is already pretty old (especially for the time period). That's even more unbelievable considering he's a warrior who can be pretty reckless at time, even if age has granted him some wisdom along the way.There's not a whole lot I can say about this book that isn't just straight up plot spoilers, but it did remind me why I've enjoyed the series so much. I was mostly reading this book 1 chapter at a time, but there was a night where the book was too good to put down and by the end of the book the final part was very enjoyable.I agree with the Author's note that there is more story left to be told, I just hope he goes about so quickly and if he doesn't end with War of the Wolf that he's only got at most 12 books by the end."}, {"userName": "Susan Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172713-susan-johnson", "userReview": "4.5 starsI was a little disappointed in this one.

When I am reading a new book in the series, this character just brings so much enjoyment to my week. There is something about the books that makes them so stress free to read too. They are written well and yet you don't have to work hard. Plenty of lovely prose in them if you want to notice it. Heaps of outstanding dialogue, which is hard not to notice. The laughs are plenty. The characters are rich in personality. It all blends so perfectly in these books and you can knock one over so quickly. Maybe too quickly. As now there is the long wait for the next book and I had already dragged out reading this one in anticipation of another one in the series coming in 2017, but it didn't, so now I wait until the end of 2018 I guess.This book is one of the most significant of the series. You would have to read it to know why. I can't really go into that without dropping in massive spoilers. It is just...monumental and prodigious. Read it to know why, and if you are a fan of the series, then enjoy!I have to say, I found the scenes between Uhtred and Constantin to be some of the most enjoyable scenes between two characters of the whole series to date. Well, at least of those I can recall and I am sure there are other 'greats' and after ten books, I simply do not remember them. But Constantin is such a character, a good match for Uhtred, and Cornwell plays both enigmatic characters off each other so well.This book is like the others in most ways. Vile, cunning priests, extraordinary warriors, great deeds and deceptions, ineffective and underwhelming nobility and rulers, travelling all over the countryside and then travelling all over it back again, lots of insults parried back and forth between Dane and Saxon, Saxon and Saxon, Pagan and priest, a bit of sea action, port action...gold action...fire action...screaming action...living life to the fullest...dying miserably..yeah, it's all there for the fan of this series...plus that one significant and momentous thing.

Parece at\u00e9 que foi ontem (2012) que comecei a s\u00e9rie acompanhando a vida de um pirralho e literalmente devorando os livros seguintes.Ap\u00f3s os acontecimentos do 9\u00ba volume, quando Uhtred, Finan e seus guerreiros derrotam o ex\u00e9rcito do irm\u00e3o de Sigtryggr, Ragnall, al\u00e9m das mortes de Brida e Haesten, agora as aten\u00e7\u00f5es do nosso protagonista voltam-se totalmente ao norte, em dire\u00e7\u00e3o \u00e0 Bebbanburg, sua fortaleza de direito.Ajudado pelo fato do seu genro Sigtryggr, casado com Stiorra, ser o comandante atual da Nort\u00fambria, Uhtred sabe que n\u00e3o ter\u00e1 que se preocupar com inimigos \u00e0s suas costas quando avan\u00e7ar para o norte, focando-se somente no que interessa. Para manter a paz, um acordo foi feito com \u00c6thelflaed, onde Sigtryggr abriu m\u00e3o de v\u00e1rias terras e de v\u00e1rios burhs que havia conquistado.Mas nem tudo s\u00e3o flores, \u00e9 claro. Ao aproximar-se de Bebbanburg, Uhtred descobre que seu primo est\u00e1 sendo abastecido com comida e contratando guerreiros a partir do noruegu\u00eas Einar, o Branco, j\u00e1 temendo um ataque de Uhtred \u00e0 fortaleza inexpugn\u00e1vel. As coisas ainda pioram quando um ex\u00e9rcito escoc\u00eas aparece, liderado pelo chefe de guerra Constantin, reivindicando todas as terras acima da Muralha de Adriano. Para eles, essa parte do territ\u00f3rio \u00e9 escocesa, e isso inclui as terras em volta de Bebbanburg. Com uma quantidade de guerreiros bem menor e sem querer se arriscar, Uhtred \u00e9 obrigado a recuar, indignado com as artimanhas aprontadas pelas fiandeiras do destino.\"Eu digo aos meus netos que a confian\u00e7a vence batalhas. N\u00e3o desejo que eles lutem, preferiria tornar o mundo de Jeremias uma realidade e viver em harmonia, mas sempre h\u00e1 algum homem, e geralmente \u00e9 um homem, que olha com inveja para os nossos campos, que quer a nossa casa, que acha que seu deus ran\u00e7oso \u00e9 melhor que o nosso, que vir\u00e1 com fogo, espada e a\u00e7o tomar o que constru\u00edmos e torn\u00e1-lo seu. E, se n\u00e3o estivermos prontos para lutar, se n\u00e3o tivermos passado aquelas horas tediosas aprendendo a usar espada, escudo, lan\u00e7a e seax, esse homem vencer\u00e1 e n\u00f3s morreremos. Nossos filhos ser\u00e3o escravos, nossas mulheres ser\u00e3o prostitutas e nosso gado ser\u00e1 morto. Por isso precisamos lutar, e um homem que luta confiante vence.\"Um oponente do passado aparece para atrapalhar ainda mais a sua vida: o poderoso ealdorman \u00c6thelhelm, sogro de Eduardo e atualmente o homem mais poderoso do reino de Wessex. Determinado a confirmar seu neto como sucessor do atual rei, ele deseja uma invas\u00e3o o quanto antes da Nort\u00fambria, o que vai de encontro \u00e0 vontade de Uhtred. \u00c6thelhelm teria que passar por cima de Sigtryggr e Stiorra, mas como foi visto no 9\u00ba livro, n\u00e3o se mexe com a fam\u00edlia dos outros.Os primeiros cap\u00edtulos desse 10\u00ba livro s\u00e3o cheios de intrigas pol\u00edticas e incertezas quanto ao futuro da Inglaterra. Ao acompanharmos os pensamentos de Uhtred, percebemos que a uni\u00e3o dos quatro reinos ainda est\u00e1 bem longe de acontecer, apesar do dom\u00ednio territorial sax\u00e3o indicar o contr\u00e1rio. E isso \u00e9 algo que com certeza ser\u00e1 MUITO explorado tamb\u00e9m nos pr\u00f3ximos volumes da s\u00e9rie, quando os pr\u00f3prios sax\u00f5es entrar\u00e3o em conflito entre si para decidir quem seguir\u00e1 o sonho de Alfredo.Com um ritmo menos empolgante que o antecessor, O Portador do Fogo sofre um pouquinho com a parte pol\u00edtica na primeira metade, quando o leitor \u00e9 constantemente deslocado para um lado e para outro, tentando entender o que est\u00e1 acontecendo e quais ser\u00e3o as consequ\u00eancias.No entanto, quando chegamos na parte onde se cumpre o prometido na sinopse, a coisa pega fogo.Nesse livro acontece algo que praticamente todos os f\u00e3s da s\u00e9rie estavam esperando. N\u00e3o escreverei aqui exatamente o que \u00e9 para n\u00e3o dar spoilers aos desavidos, mas quem acompanha a hist\u00f3ria do Uhtred desde pequeno n\u00e3o tem como errar. \u00c9 pra glorificar de p\u00e9, irm\u00e3os! Chegou o grande dia!Eu tinha desamarrado as placas faciais do elmo, deixado que eles vissem o sangue no meu rosto, que vissem o sangue na minha cota de malha, nas minhas m\u00e3os. Eu era um homem de ouro e sangue. Era um senhor da guerra e estava tomado pela f\u00faria da batalha. O inimigo estava a dez passos de dist\u00e2ncia e eu caminhei cinco desses dez, ficando sozinho diante deles. \u2014 Esta \u00e9 a minha rocha! \u2014 vociferei para eles.E que narra\u00e7\u00f5es sensacionais! Nos cap\u00edtulos finais passa um filme na nossa cabe\u00e7a, do Uhtred levando uma pancada do Ragnar velho para depois ser recebido pelo Ragnar filho, da batalha com Ubba \u00e0 beira do mar, dele derrubando Svein do Cavalo Branco, de acompanhar a morte de Kjartan pelas m\u00e3os de Ragnar, da briga por Lundene, dos momentos \u00edntimos com Gisela e seus herdeiros, da morte do rei que ele amava e odiava ao mesmo tempo, entre tantas outras coisas que fazem das Cr\u00f4nicas Sax\u00f4nicas um conjunto de narrativas \u00e9picas de brilhar os olhos.

In this book Uhtred achieves his goal he has had since book one.The Saxon Chronicles has been a historical fiction series following the story of King Aaelfred the Great of Wessex and his offspring. Unlike the other books in the series, Cornwell does not have to worry about historical accuracy in this book. In this book, he can allow his imagination to run free. Of course, he still stays within the historical parameters of his series. Uhtred recaptures his Babbenberg home, land and titles.The book is well written and the historical accuracy of the series has been meticulous. Cornwell is the master of historical fiction; he is also the master of the battle scene. His description is packed with detail and emotions. His battle scene is so dramatic he places the reader in the middle of the battle with all the sights and smells. I have enjoyed all the fascinating characters in this series, real and imaginary. I would guess this is the end of Uhtred\u2019s story. But Cornwell does have the rest of English history to tell us about.

I'm happily reunited with Serpent-Breath and Wasp-Sting. And with Uhtred too, of course.Uhtred as a young man was desirous of battle glories, daring and impetuous as any youthful warrior, often corrupted by his vices and lust for gold, and always going to wherever his fate led him. Now, as a man hardened by experience and old age, and having outlasted many of his contemporaries\u2014both friends and foes, Uhtred wants nothing more than to live the rest of his days in a place that is his by birthright, Bebbanburg, and that his uncle has so treacherously taken from him when he was a child. His uncle\u2019s son now rules his lands and fortress, which, over the years, has grown to be more solid and impregnable. Uhtred feels that it is high time to reclaim Bebbanburg, but with the fortress being well-garrisoned and fortified, the Scots suddenly making their presence known all over the place, a faction of dissident West Saxons intent on driving the Danes out of Northumbria forever, and Uhtred\u2019s plan guided only by the faith that he will triumph the way his ancestor Ida the Flamebearer did, one never knows whether his plan of recapture will ultimately prevail, or backfire. This is probably the shortest book in the series, but one that is highly reflective about life, friends, and the ugly business of doing battles. It is the most fictionalized, too, as Mr. Cornwell has admitted in his afterword, but I did appreciate Uhtred\u2019s maturity and sensitivity in this story. Although I am missing a few good personalities from the previous books and saddened by the fate of several others, I\u2019m all the more excited about the prospect of a few budding characters becoming front liners in his... next book?Just please don\u2019t make us wait too long, Mr. Cornwell."}, {"userName": "Thiago d'Evecque", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36735766-thiago-d-evecque", "userReview": "Vai ter spoiler aqui.Tirei uma estrela porque eu queria que a s\u00e9rie tivesse terminado nesse livro (em um mundo perfeito, teria terminado at\u00e9 antes).

That's about the time that the soul went out of this series that is now but a shadow of its former greatness.The first six installments were compelling. They demanded to be read and took the reader on a voyage of adventure, war and espionage Saxon style. The last four installments including this volume have been the incessant beating of a dead horse. Don't get it twisted. I love Uhtred despite this book and will sadly read more books in the Saxon Stories if ol' Corny lives to pen more. But Uhtred stories have become boring and formulaic to the point that I could easily write book 11.

Uthred must band together with Sigtriggyr, his son-in-law, to fend off the Mercians and the West Saxons. This was a great story and very exciting. I always wanted Uthred to question his loyalty to the Christians and Alfred. But through his service it seems he has finally managed to gather a band of his own with which to attack Bebbanburgh, his home that has been stolen from him by his uncle and now ruled by his cousin.There are quite a few different enemies in this story and the final fight is a four way fight involving Norse mercenaries, Scots, Uthred's crew and the cousin's forces at Bebbanburgh. It was very well done. This, sadly, seems to end Uthred's tale. These events will lead to eventual creation of the land that is England (or Englaland, as Alfred would say) and cement Anglo-Saxon rule till 1066 when they get steamrolled by William the Conqueror and the Normans.Cornwell's stories are always chock full of information and great dialogue. He really brings old historical figures to life. I enjoy his Norse characters. They are always great warrior characters. Cronwell's disdain for early Christianity and it's various tricks/oddities and bad priests often brought a smile to my face. Early Christians were truly irritating peoples and I tend to prefer the Norse/pagan religions. If you want to see what life in the late 800's was like (here's a hint-think Hobbes, as in \"Nasty, brutish and short\") and a good historical fiction about the events and warriors who forged what eventually became England-then you will enjoy this series as much as I did."}, {"userName": "Thomas Ray", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6874323-thomas-ray", "userReview": "Bernard CornwellThe Saxon Stories: ten books (11th planned for Sept./Oct. 2018): goodreads.com/series/43581bernardcornwell.net/series/the-last-k...Online map: google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?hl=en_US...Great historical novels.

Our protagonist is the son of an English earl, captured and raised by the Danes who kill his father, age 9\u201320. Well-drawn characters, a page-turner.Cornwell\u2019s approach is to put his heroes in a difficult situation, then see how they get out of it. Works a treat!Uhtred is delightfully irreverent: \u201csmall group of priests I admired and liked, hugely outnumbered by the corrupt, venal, ambitious clerics who governed the church.\u201d (book 9 p. 132 of 481) \u201cGood decent men rarely achieve power in the church. Sly and ambitious ones gain preferment.\u201d (book 8 p. 141 of 296) \u201cI wouldn\u2019t trust your god to save a worm.\u201d (book 9 p. 271 of 481) \u201cThe Christian god was just as capable of losing his temper and slaughtering children as any god in Asgard. If the purpose of life was to be an unpredictable, murderous tyrant, then it would be easy to be godlike.\u201d (book 9 p. 308 of 481)The books are fiction but mostly consistent with what\u2019s known to have really happened. Cornwell will take a terse note in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicles and write a story around it. Uhtred is fictional\u2014but people like him existed. There\u2019s a Historical Note at the end of each book where Cornwell \u201cconfesses his sins\u201d\u2014admits some of his main departures from history. The chronology is pretty close to true, with departures for the sake of the story. In Cornwell\u2019s books, Alfred\u2019s grandson \u00c6thelstan (actually born 895) is about 9 or 10 in 911 CE (book 8, pp. 4, 48, 56 of 296), 14 or 15 in 914 CE (book 9, pp. 10, 56 of 481), and 22 or 23 in 917 CE (book 10, pp. 138, 281 of 284).Cornwell says he started writing because he was refused a green card by the Carter administration: writing novels was a job you don\u2019t need a government permit to do.Cornwell says it takes him about 6 months to write a 125,000-word book. Amazingly prolific: and his stuff is good.There's a TV series, The Last Kingdom, but it bears little similarity to the books."}, {"userName": "Newton Nitro", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8151398-newton-nitro", "userReview": "The Flame Bearer \u2013 O Portador da Chama | Cr\u00f4nicas Sax\u00f4nicas Vol. 10 \u2013 Bernard Cornwell | NITROLEITURAS #resenhaE vamos que vamos para mais um Cr\u00f4nicas Sax\u00f4nicas, a saga mais testosterona medieval doidimais que t\u00e1 tendo, v\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9\u00e9io!The Flame Bearer \u2013 O Portador da Chama \u2013 Bernard Cornwell (Cr\u00f4nicas Sax\u00f4nicas Vol. 10) | Harper Collins, 2016, 304 p\u00e1ginas | Lido de 28.10.16 a 30.10.16SINOPSEA Bretanha est\u00e1 presa em uma paz ind\u00f3cil.

Uhtred did the trick, as he always does. This is very bittersweet for me because I've ripped through all the last 9 books in a little less than a year. Now I think I have to wait until October for another, which makes me very sad. (But also happy because it looks like there will definitely be another!)On to the book itself, I suppose some could detract points for the formula the Saxon Stories follow. I'm not one of those people because I'm a firm believer in \"if it ain't broke, don't fix it.\" What carries these books is Uhtred and his war dogs. There is always a battle to be fought. Always an enemy plotting against him. Always a victory to be had. But what always amazes me is the way Cornwell develops ways for him to outsmart his enemies. This book was no different, Uhtred's plan is brilliant, and of course it only goes off by the skin of his teeth and some brilliant stroke of luck, but it's just so much fun to read.The only thing that saddens me about The Flamebearer, is that other than a few key characters, I hardly recognized most of the names. Aethelflaed, Aethelhelm, Aethelstan, Sigtyggr, and Finan are all present. I think Berg's name has been mentioned in a couple of the last books, but many characters (Swithun, for example) seemed like cardboard cutouts that could come and go or be discarded as the author pleased. What I love about the earlier books was that most characters had history with Uhtred. You knew where they came from, whether they were friend or foe and why. You knew the history and camaraderie that existed between those people, and now all poor old Uhtred has is Finan and a son that will (maybe) one day, finally outshine his father. I found myself missing Leofric and Steapa and Ragnar and Gisela and Beocca and Father Prylig, and hell even Alfred. And poor Eadith, I can remember she was snatched away by Uhtred from one of his many enemies, but beyond that I can't remember why or how, or even bother to care. It could just be that I read the first 7 or 8 books back to back, but I think it has to do with these last books making some larger jumps in the timeline and Cornwell killing them all off slowly either by battle or old age. Instead of building more people into his life naturally, he's just thrown a bunch of names in there and given them some nod to history, like: \"Steapa taught me to put iron strips in my gloves.\" It was nice they were called upon but felt like a forced effort to bring back fond memories. If I can remember Steapa from five books ago, I should be able to remember Berg or Swithun or Eadith from two books ago. But I can't. Take it how you will.I'd have deducted a star for this, but ultimately, this book sees Uhtred doing what he's always set out to do and for that I can't be mad. So I'll cross my fingers for the next book and hope for more of what made those others so magical.I'll leave with this quote, because there's always one that makes me laugh out loud:\"What ails you?\" Aethelhelm asked. He was standing directly in front of me.I said nothing.\"Answer his lordship,\" Hrothard growled.\"He's...he's...he's,\" Cerdic stuttered next to me.\"He's what?\" Hrothard demanded.\"An id...id...idiot, lord.\"A shilling dropped into my hands, then another into Cerdic's. \"And you?\" Aethelhelm asked. \"What ails you?\"\"An id...idiot too.\"\"God bless both you idiots,\" Aethelhelm said, and walked on.God bless all the idiots."}, {"userName": "Wulfrun Andy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16633346-wulfrun-andy", "userReview": "Im not going to spoil this book at all for any of you.. because if your like me, you have waited n waited for it...So, all I will say is, for me, this was one of the best of the series!Its also the fastest book Ive read so far lol, with this series I always intend to r e a d i t v e r r r r r y s l o w l y....

Woot! What a fast paced novel. The ravaging battles, the masterful planning, and all the painful struggles finally come to a head. I have to say that Uhtred has got to be the most baddddassss warrior ever to exist. I\u2019m excited for him and feeling bitter sweet because though I have enjoyed Uhtreds journey, I really didn\u2019t want his journey to end. No, now that he has reclaimed his heritage, what will he do with it now? So many unanswered questions to be fulfilled.Every novel in this series is just excellent and I believe the best part is the descriptive battle scenes and the fierceness of Uhtred in battle. In this installment, it far exceeds the previous books. I felt every emotion of each warrior as if it was my own heartbeat. The writer\u2019s ability to capture a dramatic battle scene is amazing with each detail giving me a visionary experience as if I was literally there on the battle field or in the fortress itself. The humor of the warrior\u2019s right before they go into battle always cracked me up too.Uhtred just continues to amaze me. With enemy all around him, he continues to outsmart them. I loved how he used the Mad Bishop to his advantage. The set up couldn\u2019t have been more perfect. The best part is that Uhtred played each enemy against each other. With his enemies surrounding the fortress - AEthelhelm (King Edwards father-in-law) and his army , Einar the hired muscle who the Scotts had bought off, The Scottish King Constantin and his army, and don\u2019t forget inside was Uhtred\u2019s cousin and his army \u2013 however, somehow Uhtred used their hatred and madness to take each other out in order to get to and through the sea gate first \u2013 they literally did their own killing instead of Uhtred and his wolf pack having to kill them. I mean the odds were against him, but with his wolf pack \u2013 Finan, Prince AEthelstan (King Edwards son), Cerdic, Berg, Gerbruht, Swithun, Ulfar, Edric, and the boy Rorik with the help of Odin or thor, they made it all happen. I really enjoyed their friendship and loyalty to each other.You may wonder where the title/name of The Flame Bearer comes from and its relevance.Well:\n\u201cA man call Ida had come to this shore almost four hundred years before. He had landed from the sea, leading ships full of cruel men, and he had taken the crude fortress built on this rock, he had slaughtered the defenders, used their wives for his pleasure, and made their children his slaves. I was Ida\u2019s descendant. His enemies, who were now the Welsh, called him Flamdwyn, the Flamebearer.\u201d\u201cwhether the song of Ida tells true or not, one truth is certain, that Ida the Flamebearer came to this crag and had the confidence to make a new kingdom on an old island.\u201d\nUhtred\u2019s words:  \u201cNow I trod in the Flamebearer\u2019s footsteps to drench the rock with blood again.\u201dThis was such an amazing story, the whole series is just fan-freakn\u2019-tastic. I\u2019m thrilled for Uhtred and the author has written that Uhtred\u2019s work is not done yet so we get to look forward to another installment in the future.

After their bloody defeat of Danish-held East Anglia, the West Saxons stand victorious while the Mercians have taken back their land on the border of Northumbria, the last kingdom of Britain still ruled by the pagan northmen. A precarious truce exists between \u00c6thelfl\u00e6d\u2019s Mercia and Northumbria, now ruled by Uhtred of Bebbanburg\u2019s son-in-law, Sigtryggr.Under the cover of this fragile calm, Uhtred must begin his campaign that will end with the assault on Bebbanburg, the great fortress that is rightly his and was stolen from him in childhood. But his plans are shattered when the Scots surge down and lay claim to the north of England, as the West Saxons, under Uhtred\u2019s old enemy, \u00c6thelhelm, invade Northumbria from the south.
