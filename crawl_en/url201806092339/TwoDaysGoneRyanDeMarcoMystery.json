Now the husband, a best-selling author is on the run. Is it even conceivable that he\u2019s responsible for this horrid crime? Is he running because of guilt? Or is he tagged as the next victim?Thomas Huston is a College Professor and best-selling author. His wife and three children are discovered dead in their home from vicious, devastating knife wounds. Huston himself is nowhere to be found. Hiding out. Detective DeMarco, a friend and confidant is in charge of the investigation. He is obliged to follow the clues where ever they may lead\u2026 even if that points to his old friend Huston. To aid in the investigation, DeMarco cleverly uses excerpts from Huston's own novels to get in the mind of Huston...either a killer or the last victim.When does a novel become reality? Where do the lines blur between the written word and an author\u2019s brutal reality? \u201cHad the writer become the character?\u201dIt is heavyhearted. Even borderline depressing. Can a thriller actually be depressing? The characters are all sad and tragic souls, all fighting their own personal demons.

NOW AVAILABLE !In writing a novel, writers may research different places, people, professions. While working on his best-seller, Thomas Huston had conferred with state trooper Ryan DeMarco about legal aspects, criminal behavior and related topics. They became friendly over the course of many of these meetings,. Ryan DeMarco can\u2019t quite make himself believe that Huston has killed his family, this family DeMarco believed he so cherished. He had everything, why would he do that? And where is Thomas? Huston\u2019s been working on a new novel, which may or may not hold some clues to his state of mind, give DeMarco something to probe, but are there answers there? Huston\u2019s also a college professor with students and co-workers. Student affair? Professional jealousy? And where is the novel he was working on?Thomas Huston is a man with his own demons, though, his mother brutally murdered during a holdup in their little store, his father, unable to live without her, with the memories, takes his own life soon thereafter. As happy or content as he may be now, these memories never really leave.\u201cHe understood how a single event could shred a privileged life, leave it tattered and flapping in the black gales of night.\u201dRyan DeMarco also has his own demons, his son and wife gone \u2013 a tragic car accident which both Ryan and his wife survived, only to lose the one thing that tethered them to each other. This haunts him still. A student of Huston\u2019s, Nathan, is helpful in giving insights into what Huston\u2019s new novel-in-progress was about, a Lolita-like character merged with Poe\u2019s Annabelle Lee who is young and hopeful, an exotic dancer? Perhaps. In the name of research Huston went in search of the one to build his Annabelle from. And, also in the name of research, DeMarco follows in an attempt to find a girl who Huston might have viewed as his muse.

In alternating narratives we hear from DiMarco, learning his tragic back story in the process, and the suspected killer, now on the run.Starts out strong, but then there was some dialogue that seemed out of place, not fitting the circumstances and the author almost lost me there. DiMarco saved it for me, I just loved his character, this police officer that needs all the answers, asks questions, follows his own rules, but a bit deeper than the regular renegade officer. Along the way we are privy to some of the artistic elements of putting together a book, thought processes. There is an underlying sadness to many of the characters and the tone of the book is often melancholy. So the strength of a character made this an better read for me than I initially expected, along with a few plot twists.

I agree with a few other GR reviewers that Two Days Gone starts off really strong but then loses a bit of momentum. But I thought it came together pretty well in the end. Two Days Gone starts with the murder of a mother and her three children. Set in a small town in northern Pennsylvania, it is told from the point of view of the children's father -- a bestselling author and English professor -- and the police officer charged with solving the case. Both are interesting troubled men. I won't say much more to avoid spoilers, but I will emphasize again that the set up is really strong. This is very much a literary mystery/thriller. Silvis is an excellent writer, and he throws in plenty of good literary references. The characters are interesting, and his take on relationships is not simplistic. The story deflated for me toward the middle when it took a few turns that felt quite ordinary and the plot line got a bit slack, but then the end picked up again with a good twist and satisfying closure. Two Days Gone makes for a good read and I would be happy to try Silvis' next book.

I really enjoyed the authors writing style and the narrative throughout this story as it was very interesting and entertaining, which is actually what made me appreciate this book so much more. The story was told in two different points of view that of Thomas Huston a writer and professor who was accused of murder and Detective Ryan DeMarco who was tracking him down. I actually really enjoyed both of these characters; they were funny, witty, and a bit sarcastic with each of them dealing with their own personal struggles.The story unravels slowly as we follow along with Detective DeMarco's investigation, learning all the different facts and sides of the people involved.

Not only in the horrible events that occur--a man\u2019s family is brutally murdered, but also in the characters and the setting of northwestern Pennsylvania.. The water is dark, the woods hide a murderer, and a grayness fills the sky eliminating all signs of warmth and color. The author\u2019s use of descriptive details and imagery brought the dark, eerie setting alive and transported me into this book, which was not a comfortable place to be.Thomas Huston, renowned author and college professor, was living the perfect life: \u201cThe perfect family. The perfect life\u201d, all destroyed in an instant: \u201cAll gone now. Snap your fingers five times, that\u2019s how long it took. Five soft taps on the door. Five steel-edged scrapes across the tender flesh of night.\u201d Huston\u2019s wife, two sons, and daughter have been murdered and the \u201cperfect man\u201d has fled from the scene of the crime, hiding out in the woods.The community is in shock. No one believed that this perfect man was capable of committing such a crime. Why would the man who was living the perfect life kill his family? Sergeant Ryan DeMarco, who is battling his own demons, also is in a state of disbelief that Huston could do such a thing. The two men formed a bond when Huston was doing research for a book. DeMarco leads the investigation, trying to uncover the reason why this crime occurred.Two Days Gone is more of a character study of Huston and DeMarco, and the focus is on events that tie them together vs. the mystery of whether or not Huston killed his family.This was a really interesting reading experience for me. At times, I felt like I had to force myself to to continue reading. There was something about it that I wasn\u2019t connecting with and I felt like the darkness was pushing me away. Now that I have finished, I feel differently. This book and characters have stayed with me, and I continue to think about DeMarco and Huston. I would definitely recommend Two Days Gone--the characters are complex, the sentences are finely crafted, and DeMarco is a likable main character. Just be prepared for the darkness.

I'm beginning to think that I have a bias against books centered around college professors! (See also: Listen to Me, All Things Cease to Appear) I didn't dislike Two Days Gone. I just couldn't get into it. The writing was lovely, but the story and characters were just okay for me.Tom Huston's wife and three young children were stabbed to death and he's on the run. Could the beloved college professor and bestselling author have slaughtered his family? Sergeant Ryan DeMarco leads the search for the missing professor. Perhaps Tom\u2019s latest manuscript holds the answers to this mystery? The investigation takes DeMarco from the campus of Tom's university to seedy strip clubs.\nI'm reminded of Nabokov's contention that there are always two plots at work in a story. The first is the plot of the story, but above it, hovering ominously like a fat-bellied cloud, is the writer's consciousness, which is the real plot of everything he writes. If a book is filled with love, it is because the writer longs for love. If the book drips violence, it is because the writer burns to levy justice, to decimate his enemies. The writer composes such books as a means of survival. Otherwise, his psyche would unravel. And the unraveling, depending upon its form, can be either pitiful or disastrous.\n\nRYAN DEMARCO\nAmazon calls this book a Ryan DeMarco Mystery, so I'm assuming it will eventually be part of a series. DeMarco is the character we spend the most time with. He was the inspiration for one of Tom's fictional characters, so they had previously become acquainted during Tom's research. DeMarco is disdainful of academics, but he immediately identified with Tom despite their many differences. He is shocked when the picture perfect Huston family is found murdered, presumably by Tom's hand.The banter between DeMarco and his boss (his former subordinate) at the station was sometimes amusing, but I felt like I'd missed an earlier book in a series. I liked DeMarco most when he was doing fieldwork because the investigative interviews allowed me to know Tom from different perspectives. The two worlds that Tom was traveling between couldn't have been more different: (1) a university campus filled with grudges and professors fighting to make a name for themselves & (2) the strip club with tight-lipped employees who would rather stay off the grid. The closer DeMarco gets to finding Tom, the more he has to look to the literary greats to get a view into the suspect's psyche.DeMarco suffers from a lonely and empty home life. His personal life slowly takes over the narrative, which might have been why I wasn't overly enthused by the story as a whole. He and his wife Laraine separated after the tragic death of their only child. Laraine lives in a cottage where she entertains random lovers. DeMarco sits outside her home and watches, occasionally becoming one of his wife's nighttime visitors. (Their story would have been right at home in Roxane Gay's Difficult Women!) While I wasn't that interested in DeMarco's personal life, the description of his relationship with his estranged wife had a good mix of the intimate and the everyday that made their relationship feel authentic.\nTHE HUSTON FAMILY\n\nHe was both a fiction and the truth. The stronger of the two was truth, however, and the truth sickened him and hollowed him out.\nWhen we first encounter Tom Huston, he has just disposed of a large knife and is on the run. Unable to process what happened to his family, he begins to disassociate and think of himself as a fictional character. He decides to contact the mysterious Annabel, the only person who can help him piece together what happened. I was disappointed when his frenzied perspective became less frequent as the story continued! The death of Tom's entire family was objectively horrifying, but I never got a real sense of Tom as a family man so I had a hard time linking into his grief or caring whether he was guilty or innocent. The humanizing parts where there (victim intros and the Huston/DeMarco interviews), but I wasn't completely sold--maybe because the family was just a little too perfect. At round 75% there\u2019s a picture of family life which gave me inklings of emotion, but it was already too late.Tom's beautiful wife Claire is such a perfect extension of him that her portrayal, as minor as it was, irritated me. She felt more like wish fulfillment than a real-life person. The most interesting thing about her was that she and Tom used to spend nights in abandoned buildings, \"places where their only real concern was how far through the night Claire\u2019s cries and moans might carry.\" I was rolling my eyes by the time she murmurs \"Baby, make love to me again. I can never get enough of you.\"\nDoesn't every guilty man hide his deeds behind his words and hid his thoughts behind his smile? Or behind other deeds?\nI liked what I assumed was the dramatic finale, but the story just kept going and added an unnecessary complication. It was beautifully-written. Even the acknowledgments were a pleasure to read! I just didn't care about the characters enough to care about the other elements. Since what makes a character and their relationships compelling differs for everyone, I'm going to end with links to two positive reviews from Kirkus and Publisher's Weekly.\n\u201cWhat I have to do now is that which is not easy. That which I most fear. If I keep accommodating my fears, I can only move in reverse. That would be fine if by moving in reverse I could move back through time, but the past is a wall, a solid and impermeable wall. The past is a fortress that cannot be stormed.\u201d\n_______________I received this book for free from Netgalley and Sourcebooks Landmark.

The lyrical introduction and breadth of character ascribed to both Professor and novelist Tom Huston and the defeated detective Ryan DeMarco grabbed me by the throat as soon as I opened the book. I forgave awkward dialogue in the police station with the useless character of boss Bowen since I was so intent on pursuing the ravaging mystery and intense depths of the first two men. Bereft, Huston runs from police. Alternating between agony over the murder of his family and a shocked psychological distance where he tracks his course as if he is the protagonist in one of his novels, it is Tom's intent to find the woman who will point to the murderer. The prose is dark and dramatic, heart rending. I, meanwhile, am thinking that I've been introduced to a virtuoso storyteller, similar to my favourite famous Southern writers, those who bend words and wring emotions. Full stop. \" He wanted Claire\u2019s body against him again, wanted her breasts crushed against his chest, wanted his dick in her mouth, wanted to taste her pussy and to feel her body rocking against him wave after wave. He wanted all of it and he would never have any of it ever again. Only a man like Thomas Huston deserved those things. Who he was now, he did not know.\"I did not know this character either. He had nothing to do with the desperate man who had just a paragraph prior been bleeding his pain through the page. He wanted HIS DICK SUCKED? Randall Silvis' characters and I suffered a parting of the ways from that point on. From depth, the novel dived into sleeze, stripper joints, lap dances and hookers displacing earlier nuance, instead meant to approximate the noir grittiness of a hard line detective oeuvre. The promising beginning was beguiling, not sustained and Silvis could not bring himself to give us a good dose of Southern redemption for those most fragile heroes. I tiredly read the conclusion, and thought, \"Who cares?\" Randall Silvis, you shouldn't have shown me that you could write like a genius, and then mid-book give up your pen to a publisher's flack. The hard landing after such a heady lift off as I began Two Days Gone may have predisposed my review to be a bit harsher than it should have been, but I really was disappointed.

Ryan DeMarco, a state trooper has to lead the investigation into these horrific murders and find his friend Thomas Huston who was seen walking through the neighborhood dazed. Where is Thomas? The novel is told from the points of view of both Thomas Huston and Ryan DeMarco. The whole time while I was reading this I didn't know who committed these grisly murders. Both protagonists I cared about more and more.They are both flawed and haunted by their own demons. As Thomas is wandering through the woods I could tell that he was cold, hungry and exhausted. His only hope was in reaching Annabelle, who is an exotic dancer whom he was meeting to discuss with her questions about the profession she worked for. In his novel he was writing he made references to Poe\"s Annabelle Lee and Nakabov's Lolita. Nathan, who was Huston's student told Sergeant Ryan DeMarco that Huston's manuscript was a maroon journal. DeMarco located the journal, but will it give him some insight into Huston's state of mind or help him locate Huston?I really loved this literary mystery crime thriller. I was spellbound while reading this and read it straight through. I like to be kept guessing and I loved the noir atmospheric setting. DeMarco had lost an infant in a car accident, his wife left him. He can't let her go. Many nights he spends in his parked car watching her bring home a different guy every single night. I believe a novel has successfully caught my attention when I can't stop thinking about the characters long after I have finished the book. Highly recommended! 5 stars.Thank you to Randall Silvis, Source books publisher and Net Galley for providing me with my copy of this outstanding work."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36555254-robin", "userReview": "3.5 starsplease, for the love of everything holy, Goodreads, can we make half star ratings already?? there's such a difference between 3 and 4 starsA great thriller continues to be such an elusive animal for me.Main character Thomas Huston is a successful writer and a professor of creative writing. One day, his wife and three beautiful children are found murdered in gruesome violence - and he is on the run. Police detective Ryan deMarco, a friend of Huston's, is desperately trying to find him before the situation gets worse. He's also desperately hoping Huston didn't massacre his family. Both men are haunted by loss and have darkness in their hearts, a basis for an unlikely but unwavering friendship.I was initially entranced because, as someone who loves reading and writing, I'm always hooked with literary references and writerly inferences. This story has both. Huston is inspired by the greats (Nabokov, Faulkner and Poe to name a few) and those authors are echoed through the book, as are Huston's writing techniques and journals.\"The woods are UGLY, dark and deep...\" Huston thinks, twisting Frost's words as he shivers in the forest, barely able to touch his thoughts to what happened to his family. The writing in these scenes is masterful, describing the avalanche of pain that crashes over him with each fresh realisation. He eventually has to dissociate and become the author of this nightmare story, deciding his own actions as he would for a character in one of his books. It is the only way he can put one foot in front of the other.Writing like this propelled me forward and left me in admiration of this author. The unraveling of plot, while perfectly ok, wasn't quite as brilliant, unfortunately. Oh thrillers, why am I so easily left unsatisfied?

He's a college professor, best selling author, and devoted family man - with a beautiful wife, Claire, and three wonderful children, Thomas Jr., Alyssa, and David. Then one night Claire and the children are brutally murdered.....and Huston goes on the run. The professor immediately becomes the prime suspect in the eyes of the Pennsylvania State Police. Police Sergeant Ryan DeMarco gets the job of tracking Huston down. As it happens the two men are acquainted, having met when Huston was researching a 'state trooper character' for his new book. DeMarco got a favorable impression of Huston and can't fathom how the writer could wipe out his whole family. DeMarco isn't a stranger to tragedy himself. Years ago he and his wife Laraine lost a child in a tragic car accident. Inconsolable, Laraine left DeMarco and began a string of one-night-stands. For his part DeMarco took to excessive drinking and lurking outside his estranged wife's apartment. The novel is told from the alternating points of view of Huston and DeMarco. As the story unfolds Huston is trudging through the freezing woods, looking for food and shelter, hoping to get assistance from a woman he calls Annabel. The writer is distraught and disturbed and thinks of himself as a character in his own book. DeMarco, meanwhile, interviews Huston's neighbors, colleagues, and students - trying to figure out the writer's state of mind and where he might go. One student, Nathan Briessen, informs the detective that Huston kept a journal and that his new book is inspired by Edgar Allan Poe's poems and Vladimir Nabokov's novel \"Lolita\" - all of which are liberally referenced in the story. Thus \"Two Days Gone\" feels like a literary novel as well as a mystery. For me though, the numerous literary references stalled the story a little too much. While chasing Huston, DeMarco uses troopers and dogs..... and stakes out places Huston might go. All this heightens the suspense. Eventually DeMarco learns the truth about what occurred on the night of the murders and what led up to it. This revelation is followed by additional drama - with some twists and surprises. The story contains a variety of compelling characters, but to mention specifics would lessen the thrill of discovery, so I'll refrain. (You're welcome. LOL) \"Two Days Gone\" is very dark but there are lighter moments when DeMarco is bantering with his station commander, Sargeant Kyle Bowen. I enjoyed these humorous scenes, which provided a respite from the tension. At one point, DeMarco calls his boss an asshole, and Bowen says \"I'm getting a little annoyed with your insubordination. From now on, it's Sargeant Asshole.\" (ha ha ha)This is a well-written, well-plotted book that I'd recommend to mystery fans.Thanks to Netgalley, the author, and the publisher for a copy of the book.You can follow my reviews at http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Fictionophile ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4428094-fictionophile", "userReview": "Five years ago I read \u00a0a great book by Randall Silvis called \"The boy who shoots crows\". \u00a0I was very impressed by the plot and the writing so was therefore happy to see another book by this author offered on Edelweiss.Set in late autumn, \"Two Days Gone\" features two admirable and likable protagonists.Sergeant Ryan DeMarco is a man with little hope in his life. \u00a0His wife has left him.

The hopelessness of the protagonist's situation didn't leave room for a satisfactory or in any way positive turn to their lives. \u00a0I liked both Thomas Huston and Ryan DeMarco, so I felt 'bummed out' while reading as I couldn't imagine how their situations could improve, regardless of the outcome of the story.

It was an intricate character study of two troubled men set amidst a slowly unraveling mystery. Written in detailed, atmospheric prose from the perspectives of DeMarco and Huston, I preferred the chapters from DeMarco's perspective. Yeah, he was the quintessential flawed cop fighting his own demons, but he was extremely likable and I enjoyed his humorous exchanges with his superior and colleagues, which were a welcome boost in an otherwise very heavy and depressing tale. I also enjoyed the book-related elements of this, such as the insights into the writing process and the literary references, which were quite cleverly incorporated into the plot. The strength of this was certainly in the characterization of the two main characters. This should appeal to anybody who enjoys elaborately written literary fiction.

If you\u2019re seduced  by the darker, deeper, grittier side of literature, with vivid descriptions, you will be drawn to the grisly, moody, atmospheric, graphic, disturbing, and unsettling tale, with a clever thought-provoking literary twist. A book within a book. Not for the faint-hearted.  A bold powerhouse novel and author. The cover, copy and book description: A \"bullseye.\" Right On. Gripping, taut, sensitive, and astute.  Even the inner musings of the characters have a poetic power. A haunting character-driven study of two deeply flawed and troubled men protagonists (alternating narratives).  Both solitary men in their own way.  DeMarco lived alone, and of course, Huston did not. Both had complicated relationships with others. DeMarco had no center. He ventured out from emptiness and to emptiness he returned. One case of tragedy after another, puzzle after morbid puzzle to solve. What if he had made better choices twelve years ago on that rainy night?Sergeant Ryan DeMarco  of the Pennsylvania State Police has seen his share of despair, violence, and malicious acts. From college students to strip clubs, the woods, the streets- there lies a murderer. Hiding. A man, gone mad in the blink of an eye. A man turned into a beast.  A murderer is in their midst.  A community. One of their own. Someone they all trusted. a bestselling author. The education of sons and daughters. They had seen his smiling face in local bookstores and watched him with Katie on Good Morning America.Claire Huston, one of the prettiest women in town is dead with a slash across her throat. Thomas, Jr, twelve, a sixth grader also dead, same way. Sister, Alyssa, fourth grade, also murdered. Little David Ryan Huston, asleep on his back in his crib. A blade thrust in his heart. A second one. A chef\u2019s knife. The perfect family.  The perfect house. The perfect life. All gone. Snap your fingers five times, that\u2019s how long it took. Five steel-edged scrapes across the tender flesh of night. Why was the baby killed differently than the others in the family? Stabbed in the heart twice. The bodies of the Huston family had been discovered. From family, neighbors, and friends. All stunned and grief-stricken. All eyes turned toward the husband, the father, the accomplished writer, the professor. He had fled.DeMarco had met Thomas Huston previously. He had read all his books. A reader. He was a friend. He reminded him of a young Jack Kerouac. Thomas Huston was a professor. A writer. He loved his students. He was working on a new book. A trooper was one of the main characters. They had met on several occasions and connected on several levels. There was Huston\u2019s tragic past.  The bungled robbery of the family hardware store. The blast that tore out his mother\u2019s throat. His father\u2019s suicide two weeks later from an overdose. The horrific images still haunted Thomas. The memories overwhelmed him. Now, his own family. Was he the murderer? Or someone else?DeMarco had his demons.  A ruined marriage, his son\u2019s death, his anger, his aggressive behavior, and the subsequent demotion. His drinking. The accident that took his son\u2019s life. He and Huston had connected. How could this man have killed his entire family? He loved them. He was a good and decent man. He spoke so fondly of them. He was not a violent man. Did something set him off? Now Huston was out there. He had fled. Maybe he is amnesic?

A book released three and half years after his parent\u2019s death. Other profiles from Poets and Writers. Interviews. Characters. It was clear that Thomas Huston, like his character, suffered some very dark moments. But dark enough to cause him to slaughter his own family? The rage and grief. What would have gone through his mind for him to do this to his family? Huston was a writer, teacher, and student.  It was his job to make order out of disorder. To find the meaning in metaphor. DeMarco is on the hunt, digging for each piece of evidence. The woods, his students, and strip clubs (Whispers). Strippers, hookers, an abortion, dancers, bouncers. Research for his books. Did he have enemies? Were all the associations for his book, or personal? Was Hutson\u2019s life idyllic  as it had seemed? He was the primary suspect and DeMarco took no pleasure in that discovery. Marco could drink himself into a stupor, but he needed a clear head. He had to figure out who murdered this family. He liked this man. He owes him to find out what happened. He goes back and forth with his suspicions. The more he learns, he wonders if the writer had become the characters in his book? Had the murder and suicide of Huston\u2019s parents loosened something in him or spawned a rage he struggled with, and finally lost? Who was Annabel? Bonnie? Tex? Were these relationships an integral part of the slaughter at the Huston home? After the murder, Huston had been spotted wandering through the dawn in a daze. Where else would he go? Could he have been cheating on his wife? DeMarco had to find him. As he digs deeper, with the homicide investigation, time is of the essence. Four people are dead and three of them are children. If Thomas is running because he is innocent, who is the guilty party? DeMarco wanted Hutson to be better than this. Someone he could admire. Had the equation changed? Was it infidelity, madness, lust, weakness? He had to know!Who could Thomas trust? Who can he turn to for help? Complex characters.  It\u2019s the contradictions in a personality that make for conflict. Did he take the qualities for each of these women to build his characters or was it something else?In the meantime, we hear from Thomas hiding out. Like some character out of a Flannery O\u2019Conner story. Hiding in a shed. A misfit. Hunted. Hates. Will his life ever get better? The events leading up to the murder. The book is in his head. Is this all a dream? The lines are blurred. From literary references  to Poe, Hemingway, Steinback, Faulkner, Macbeth, Wolfe, O'Connor, Nabokov and Poe\u2019s Annabels, Poe\u2019s  poetry. A trinity of troubled men. A kinship. Misery. What parts are made up and what is real? \u201cTo the casual observer, Huston\u2019s life would have appeared blessed. But this was the illusion Huston had created and maintained. A man patient and generous with his students, a picture-perfect wife and family, shirts and chinos always neatly pressed, fame and financial success; a man respected envied; a man with a life each of his students longed for. Was it all a construction meant to conceal in himself the same dark urges that drove Huston\u2019s characters? His life had seemed a sunlit lagoon, but what currents made the blue water shimmer. A lifetime of struggle and ambition. Parents, taken away by violence. Professional jealousies. The stresses of fame; the loss of anonymity. The pressure to live up to the hype, to always be better, brighter, more successful, more worthy of praise.Was it as simple as that?  The fa\u00e7ade as thin and brittle as all facades are, shattered? Had Huston snapped? Was he deliriously happy in his insanity? Weightless and free? No shame, no remorse, no obligations, no sin?\"  Does the life of novelists  show up in fiction, thinly disguised as somebody else\u2019s life? Portions of the journal were totally fiction; others not? Discerning the difference would be the hard part. Were the character\u2019s desires actually Huston\u2019s desires brought to the surface?Did Thomas dream of these events,  or did they actually occur? The knife. How could he go home? All is gone.

If the book drips of violence, it is because the writer burns to levy justice, to decimate his enemies? A means of survival. Otherwise, his psyche would unravel. Pitiful or disastrous.

Will he be so desperate to commit suicide or seek revenge, if, in fact, he was not the killer? He may have nothing to lose.Between pressure at the station to find Huston and his need to help this man, the author keeps the suspense high, while readers slowly learn what went down that fatal tragic horrific night. His family had been butchered.  Did helping someone with a simple choice in life - set the stage; putting things in motion, for a string of deadly events to unfold, with devastating consequences? TWO DAYS GONE  is like no other book I have ever read and surely it will be at the top of the bestseller list. Silvis grabs you from the first page to the last, with the introduction of this new series, and anxiously awaiting the next! Ferocious storytelling  that makes you think, and feel with an array of emotions. From the dark and ugly pit of the human psyche. Sadness, pain, suffering, tragedy, love, and loss, sprinkled with a heavy literary flair. The relationship and narrative between the two men sealed the book. Both equally strong and powerful. The relationship between writer and reader, priceless. Other readers have asked me about a similar author or book to compare. I can honestly say, this work is unique. In regards to the crime thriller genre, comes to mind is possibly Paul Cleave  (New Zealand), Of course, his Trust No One is a book within a book, as well. Cleave's crime writing is also gritty and dark, with twisted humor, and his cop leads, tend to become emotionally connected. Fans of David Bell  and Dennis Lehane will also enjoy. With Silvis, you receive the crime + the literary fiction in one package, a rare find.  \"The poet's, the writer's, duty is to write about these things. It is his privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.\" -William Faulkner This one will stay with you. Chilling. A murder mystery, both absorbing and entertaining, from an experienced author drawing from his own experience as a writer and academic. Connecting with readers and writers:  My favorite part: (Acknowledgements) this is only a small portion:\u201cA writer\u2019s job is to love his readers and to want nothing more than to pilot them from experience to experience, emotion to emotion. The best fiction is a voyage of feeling, and the writer\u2019s job is to generate sentipensante for his readers, those feelings that give rise, not to an intellectual kind of knowledge but an emotional knowledge, a deeper connection with what Faulkner called \u201cthe old verities and truths of the heart.\u201d  (love William Faulkner: Nobel Prize Speech Stockholm, Sweden 12/10/50). \u201cAnother way of looking at this relationship between writer and readers is through its intimacy; the reader comes, to a story wanting to be wooed, desirous of seduction. If the writer\u2019s inducements are successful, the voice sufficiently tempting, the promises sufficiently alluring, the reader gives herself over to the story not for minutes but hours, and for days at a time, melding her own imagination with the writer\u2019s while falling into step with the characters, hoping for the best, giving them her heart.

Ann Patchett, in her semi-autobiographical novel COMMONWEALTH, drew from her own life in a blended family. Karin Fossum in BROKEN adopts a more distanced approach. She creates and then inhabits a fictional character, the Author. This alter-ego claims to be merely giving voice to the characters in her book. They must make their own choices within the situations she creates. She does not control them, she insists. The Author suffers for her compulsion, living a life of uncertain success and isolation. Here, author Randall Silvis plays with even darker questions about this mingling of real and imagined persona. Does an author indulge his own forbidden fantasies through his characters? Is he exposing secret thoughts about those around him or merely reworking realistic mannerisms? Does his self-imposed solitude weaken defenses and release personal demons? Speculations about creativity rising from the crucible of suffering, about the idea of the mad genius, fuel the mythology of the artist. Numerous examples of alcoholism, depression, mental instability and suicide haunt the histories of many prominent authors. Silvis draws on these pre-conceptions with extraordinary skill. At times, the reader will find himself nodding in agreement as Pennsylvania state trooper Ryan DeMarco investigates the horrific murder of an author's family. The author, Thomas Huston, is the primary suspect, but was also DeMarco's friend. DeMarco, however, is not merely meant to channel the reader's thinking. He is a sensitive troubled person with his own tragic burden. Tragedy, in fact, was the commonality shared by the two men. Huston's bestseller was gestated in the nine months following the murder of his mother, and the suicide of his father. DeMarco and his wife separated after the death of their infant son in an automobile accident. The relationship between DeMarco and Huston is expressed poignantly by the silences in their conversations. These caesura-like pauses reinforce the rhythm of their mutual empathy. DeMarco had met Huston's family, a beautiful wife, a preteen son, an elementary-school aged daughter, and a toddler son. Their refuge of love seemed inviolable. So what could have happened? DeMarco doesn't want to believe Huston murdered his family. Neither does the reader. But authors don't always give us what we want, do they?The police have tracked Huston to the edge of a freezing bog before losing the trail. DeMarco asks a colleague, Jayne Matson, about the mindset of someone like Huston, someone who has just butchered his entire family. Matson, just shy of a masters degree in psychology, protests she has too little information. She ventures the fugitive might be in shock from the horror, dissociated, perhaps even an amnesiac. Those conclusions are reinforced by glimpses of Huston, wading through the icy bog. Huston chants corrupted phrases from Robert Frost, while lapsing into detached musings, as if he were writing the thoughts of a fictional character.  \u201cWith a little effort, Huston was able to achieve the split point of view that allowed him to do his best work. Usually, he was aware first of himself at his desk, blue ink moving across a yellow legal pad, but also aware of himself as the character in the story unrolling in his imagination. This time, the perspectives were reversed. He was the character first, cold and tired and hungry, and then, removed to the background, the writer watching and directing the action.\u201d (Location 666) From this starting point, fragments of reality gradually infiltrate Huston's inchoate thoughts. His resolve coalesces around a new puzzle. He is obsessed with the idea that a person named Annabel, of whom we have no other information, can bring clarity to his situation. Silvis introduces other complicated characters when DeMarco interviews Huston's colleagues and students at the university where Huston taught. All of them reveal more about themselves than they do about Huston. DeMarco uncovers hints of professional jealousy, unrequited love, and academic backbiting which only occlude any straight-forward theory. Silvis also demonstrates a talent for procedural narration. With patience and persistence, he interrogates one of Huston's promising graduate students, Nathan Briessen. Briessen is so distracted by his own anguish that DeMarco almost accidentally teases out details relevant to the case: Huston's current project reflected themes from Nabokov's LOLITA; he was doing research at various strip clubs; he wrote his notes and draft in long-hand; the working title of the book was \u201cD\u201d and its four sections were to be called \u201cDesire,\u201d \u201cDeception,\u201d \u201cDespair,\u201d and \u201cDiscernment.\u201d Silvis narrates in third person, alternating the viewpoints between DeMarco and Huston. He presents an interesting contrast between the two men. The author, despite the solitude demanded by his vocation, was an able departmental administrator and gracious mentor who often had students over to his house. DeMarco, charged with a responsibility \u201cto serve and protect\u201d the public had lapsed into a surly attitude softened only by abrasive humor after his wife left. DeMarco loves the enveloping solitude of the woods and savors the sounds of nature. The fugitive Huston's brain, however, echoes with the chant:  \u201cThese woods are ugly, dark and deep....\u201d (Location 653)Silvis is restrained in his writing, applying a poetic voice with judicious effect. Here is a passage early in the book in which he sets the mood.  \u201cBut here in Pennsylvania's farthest northern reach, Lake Wilhelm stretches like a bony finger down a glacier-scoured valley, its waters dark with pine resin, its shores thick on all sides with two thousand acres of trees and brush and hanging vines, dense with damp shadows and nocturnal things, with bear and wildcat and coyote, with hawks that scream in the night.\u201d (Location 116) Conflicted characters, strategically placed questions, suspenseful scenes, controlled prose and an unpredictable dynamic hold the reader's interst to the very end."}, {"userName": "Anja", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5149499-anja", "userReview": "This was a five star read for me because the story and the authors brilliant writing had me glued to the screen, and it took a while before I could let the story go after having finished. It is more than a crime novel, it is the story about two men\u2019s struggle trying to do the right thing. The novel draws you in from the beginning and stays with you after the end. The reader is immediately being plunged into the lives of Professor Thomas Huston and police sergeant Ryan DeMarco, who is leading the investigation and the manhunt of Huston, who has just experienced his worst nightmare and is on the run. It is now up to DeMarco to find out who did it! The chapters are taking turns between the two men, who are practically friends but also very different characters. Sergeant DeMarco is described as a man who has gone through some ugly stuff in life, some similar to Huston and strikes me as a truly thorough and honest cup, you just have to love him and his funny remarks. Here\u00b4s a quote where DeMarco is trying to get information out of a stubborn secretary: \u201cThe thought popped into his head that maybe she was flirting with him. Was it possible?. He considered again the overdone hairdo, the overly tight dress, the overabundant cleavage. But he dismissed the possibility. He knew this kind of woman. She laid out all the necessary bait but only so as to lure the victim close enough that she could slap him silly\u201d. I can tell you no more (afraid of spoilers), only this \u2013 you will never guess who did it until the end, which is my kind of detective novel. Ps. I loved that the writer writes about a writer.

The biggest one is that much of the action takes place in parts of Pennsylvania and Ohio about a 45-minute drive north of our northeastern Ohio home. That alone - seeing names of cities, small towns and places in between that we've visited too many times to count - got my attention. The job of keeping it, though, falls directly into the hands of the author - and what a great job he did!That said, it not a book to be skimmed; the writing is brilliant, but close to what I'd call ponderous. Some of that, no doubt is because one of the two central characters, Tom Huston, is a bestselling author and college professor and the other, Pennsylvania State Police Sgt. Ryan DeMarco, is a well-read guy who in many ways doesn't fit the description of standard-issue cop. The two men have met and like each other, but circumstances here cause one to become a hunter and the other the hunted.The story begins with the brutal murder of Huston's wife and three children in their home. When Huston goes missing, the assumption is that the mild-mannered, popular writer-educator who was working hard on a new book with a lead character loosely based on Vladimir Nabokov's Lolilta and Edgar Allan Poe's \"Annabel Lee,\" somehow snapped. DeMarco doesn't quite see Huston's killer potential, although he wonders why the man has run away. But whether Huston is guilty or innocent, it's now DeMarco's job to find him and bring him in.As the search progresses, DeMarco travels in and out of many places familiar to me like Erie and Linesville Pa., and Conneaut and Pierpont, Ohio. At one point, I was surprised to see a reference to the 1985 tornado that destroyed much of Albion, Pa., but - as I can personally attest - not before it wreaked serious havoc in and around my town of Niles, Ohio. It is character development, though, that takes center stage; little by little, we see into the hearts and minds of various characters - Huston and DeMarco in particular. DeMarco, for instance, is no stranger to tragedy; a traffic accident a few years earlier resulted in the death of his young son and, ultimately, the loss of his much-loved wife. His understanding of anguish, in fact, is one of the reasons he not only doesn't accept Huston's guilt and ultimately is willing to put his own career on the line to get to the truth.It's rare that I give much credence to official book descriptions issued by publishers, but in this case, their word \"masterful\" is right on target. Kudos to the author, and many thanks to the publisher, via NetGalley, for the opportunity to read the book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Sofia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14453898-sofia", "userReview": "[Find the bad guy, the one who has no character development and shove it all on him.
