The sheer life force of this novel is amazing, the prose is masterful and wickedly funny, and the journey is like nothing I've ever been on before. Now I'll shut up and let the far more eloquent Mr. Barth take over. Here's the opening line:\"In the last years of the Seventeenth Century there was to be found among the fops and fools of the London coffee-houses one rangy, gangling flitch called Ebenezer Cooke, more ambitious than talented, and yet more talented than prudent, who, like his friends-in-folly, all of whom were supposed to be educating at Oxford or Cambridge, had found the sound of Mother English more fun to game with than her sense to labor over, and so rather than applying himself to the pains of scholarship, had learned the knack of versifying, and ground out quires of couplets after the fashion of the day, afroth with Joves and Jupiters, aclang with jarring rhymes, and string-taut with similes stretched to the snapping-point.\""}, {"userName": "Franco  Santos", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29931457-franco-santos", "userReview": "Luego de nueve d\u00edas y m\u00e1s de 1200 p\u00e1ginas puedo decir con total seguridad que El plantador de tabaco es una obra maestra. Una historia declamada por decenas de personajes variopintos que entran en escena para luego salir y volver a entrar cientos de p\u00e1ginas despu\u00e9s, piratas, esclavos, indios, personajes hist\u00f3ricos como Charles Calvert, Francis Nicholson o el mismo Ebenezer Cooke y m\u00faltiples relatos dentro de relatos. Una locura llevada a su grado m\u00e1ximo, en la que la identidad carece de valor real y su suplantaci\u00f3n es moneda corriente, la virginidad es un prestigio ilusorio entre el trasfondo de la masacre entre nativos y conquistadores, el l\u00edmite entre lo salvaje y lo civilizado se difumina y una intriga pol\u00edtica tan enrevesada y desesperante que no se tiene nunca constancia de lo que sucede.La escritura de Barth me result\u00f3 extraordinaria, en especial por su manejo de los tiempos para hacer determinadas revelaciones. Cuando el libro comienza a lentificarse, saca una sorpresa debajo de la manga que propulsa la historia por unos cuantos cap\u00edtulos que hacen del proceso de lectura un viaje de lo m\u00e1s adictivo. Sus descripciones envuelven al lector en la atm\u00f3sfera del Maryland del siglo XVII e inicios del XVIII y los di\u00e1logos, aunque a veces pecan de artificiales, se sienten reales a pesar de las exageraciones propias de la s\u00e1tira.Lo principal de El plantador de tabaco es la burla al sentido de la vida, de la conexi\u00f3n de los hechos y de la seriedad con la que (quiz\u00e1) deber\u00eda tomarse la existencia. Todo lo que ocurre en este relato (y en parte epopeya) es un delirio que sobrepasa cualquier esencia significativa. Barth se sienta sobre miles de a\u00f1os de escritos filos\u00f3ficos y proclama desde la altura un nuevo orden: el caos. La endeblez de la historia y de lo que nos hace ser quienes somos. Rompe la moralidad impuesta, la \u00e9tica absurda y la inocencia inconcebible y despliega una sucesi\u00f3n de aventuras no solo grandiosa sino tambi\u00e9n inquietante.En fin. El plantador de tabaco es una obra maestra plagada de humor, inteligencia y profundidad, que recomiendo sin dudarlo."}, {"userName": "Fionnuala", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "[ (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Well-loved books from my pastRating: 5 golden stars of five, with a rapturous yodel cluster The Publisher Says: Considered by critics to be Barth's most distinguished masterpiece, The Sot-Weed Factor has acquired the status of a modern classic. Set in the late 1600s, it recounts the wildly chaotic odyssey of hapless, ungainly Ebenezer Cooke, sent to the New World to look after his father's tobacco business and to record the struggles of the Maryland colony in an epic poem. On his mission, Cooke experiences capture by pirates and Indians; the loss of his father's estate to roguish impostors; love for a farmer prostitute; stealthy efforts to rob him of his virginity, which he is (almost) determined to protect; and an extraordinary gallery of treacherous characters who continually switch identities. A hilarious, bawdy tribute to all the most insidious human vices, The Sot-Weed Factor has lasting relevance for readers of all times. My Review: The book description is a bit weak-kneed, but I can't find a better one, and I detest writing the book reports with a passion.A couple months ago, I started a re-read of this book that did not go well. I sighed. I snorted. I rolled my eyes, and cut up rough whenever we got into the book's faux-antique Englysshe. I was responding to it like it was a phauntaiysee nawvelle with majgickq and other such borderline-criminal goins-on. I put it aside, and I forgot it, except to renew it online from the Port Washington liberry.Damn me anyway! Why can't I listen to my REAL self?! John Barth, my Real Self murmured, John Barth of The Floating Opera and this book which you adored thirty years ago, he deserves better than this, to which Angry Self replied, \u201cShut up you! Seven hundred plus pages of this phauntaaahsticall-ness will make us homicidal! Why not encourage me to read Dickens or Tolkien if all you want to is encourage me to massacre random strangers? Silence! Begone!\u201dDamn me! What an ass! I read the first six chapters and tossed the book aside! But...I did keep renewing it....And today, today with two days left on my final renewal, to-goddam-day I pick the book up again. And I read the first paragraph/line. And oh damn me! Damn me! How beautiful, how simply and completely perfect it is, and how I wish I could boil Angry Me in oil!In the last years of the seventeenth century there was to be found among the fops and fools of the London coffee-houses one rangy, gangling flitch called Ebenezer Cooke, more ambitious than talented, and yet more talented than prudent, who, like his friends-in-folly, all of whom were supposed to be educating at Oxford or Cambridge, had found the sound of Mother English more fun to game with than her sense to labor over, and so rather than applying himself to the pains of scholarship, had learned the knack of versifying, and ground out quires of couplets after the fashion of the day, afroth with Joves and Jupiters, aclang with jarring rhymes, and string-taut with similes stretched to the snapping-point.Oh.

It's just not. This isn't a book to be got through, it is a book to be appreciated, savored, delighted in.I will await the tides of fortune washing a copy of my own back up on the shores of my private liberry.

I'd like to compare it to Bob Dylan\u2019s 115th Dream, but alas it's already been done. The song's plot is not all that far from what John Barth is up to in The Sot-Weed Factor, but Barth is far more (dare I say it) exhausting. This is a mock history of the real life poet Ebenezer Cooke, who wrote the Hudibrastic poem \"The sot-weed factor: or, A voyage to Maryland. A satyr. In which is describ'd the laws, government, courts and constitutions of the country, and also the buildings, feasts, frolicks, entertainments and drunken humours of the inhabitants of that part of America. In burlesque verse\".That title is sort of a plot outline for the novel, with the million little twists and turns left out.\n\nBarth's meticulous attention to historical detail and his excellent imitation of the tone and style of the 18th c. novel had me believing this world. Slightly. The plot is outrageous! There is a crazy coincidence on nearly every page. And it's so dense and complicated that you need a chart to figure it all out. On one level Barth is a serious storyteller, but he pushes his writing to the outer limits of the sensible - as in this delightful chapter heading, \"The Poet Wonders Whether the Course of Human History Is a Progress, a Drama, a Retrogression, a Cycle, an Undulation, a Vortex, a Right- or Left-Handed Spiral, a Mere Continuum, or What Have You. Certain Evidence Is Brought Forward, but of an Ambiguous and Inconclusive Nature.\" If you read this book with a straight face it's very satisfying - but a silly grin with occasional laughter works too.Ah, except for poor Joan Toast.It's like this song - you can laugh...or just go with it.There are stories within stories, characters within characters, plots within plots. Books within books. Things either go horribly wrong or wondrously right, as if there were an outside hand always intervening. \nJohn BarthFrom how many ships must a man get tossed,Before you call him drowned??Get the ebook here."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "[plucked.

Good description.Don't expect brevity or logic here.I already knew Barth was a formidable and unique writer, since I'd read and loved Lost in the Funhouse a long time ago.The Sot-Weed Factor is an entirely different type of novel. So Barth, like the most brilliant writers, is extremely versatile and has proven he can write well in completely different styles. Barth's lengthy novel, written with very authentic dialogue (and, in the texts-within-the texts, written style) of the times, tracks the innumerable adventures of one Ebenezer Cooke, who was born in England in 1666 and died in Maryland in 1732 (or at least that's the arc of the novel). Our hero is based on a real poet, Ebenezer Cook (sometimes spelled Cooke) who lived around the same time and wrote a biting satirical poem scourging life in Maryland entitled \"The Sot-Weed Factor\". (In the idiom of that time, a sot-weed factor is a tobacco dealer). Little is known of the real Ebenezer Cook. This real poem and poet are obviously the source of Barth's title and his main character. The poem is also the source of certain basic plot elements. But that's like saying a vegetable is the source of a culinary masterpiece or a simple tune is the source of a complex jazz piece. Barth, our chef/jazzman (expressing himself through his characters) creates complex riffs on the original undreamed of by the real Cook.Ebenezer Cooke is a genuine horse's ass at the beginning of the novel. He's pompous, pretentious, and hoarding his innocence (both of life and of sex) like it's gold (although at least in the beginning of the book, he's quite reserved). Only later on does he start trumpeting his virtues. He's about to flunk out of Cambridge, since he's started dabbling with writing verse . Ebenezer is also paralyzed by a lack of direction. His problem is that he finds every path in life equally appealing and cannot decide between them.In the book's opening paragraph, Barth describes Ebenezer thus:\"IN THE LAST YEARS OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY THERE WAS TO BE found among the fops and fools of the London coffee-houses one rangy, gangling flitch called Ebenezer Cooke, more ambitious than talented, and yet more talented than prudent, who, like his friends-in-folly, all of whom were supposed to be educating at Oxford or Cambridge, had found the sound of Mother English more fun to game with than her sense to labor over, and so rather than applying himself to the pains of scholarship, had learned the knack of versifying, and ground out quires of couplets after the fashion of the day, afroth with Joves and Jupiters, aclang with jarring rhymes, and string-taut with similes stretched to the snapping-point\"Ebenezer gets a surprise visit in his Cambridge rooms from his former tutor, Henry Burlingame. Burlingame had disappeared for no apparent reason after teaching Ebenezer and his twin sister, Anna, at the estate of their father, Andrew, in St. Giles in the Fields. Burlingame was a fantastic teacher and curious about all subjects and the world in general. Ebenezer's indecision about his life's path is in part a result of Burlingame's eclectic tutelage, that made all life paths seem equally desirable.Burlingame, hearing that Ebenezer is about to be kicked out of Cambridge, explains his disappearance (Andrew Cooke had presumed that Burlingame had designs on Anna, and fired him on the spot). He also proposes a business venture: that Ebenezer should join him in London in a tutoring business. \"Unhappy day!\" laughed Ebenezer. \"I've no skill in any craft or tradewhatever. I cannot even play Flow My Tears on the guitar. I can do nothing/'\"Then 'tis plain you'll be a teacher, like myself.\"\"'Sheart! Twould be the blind leading the blind!\"\"Aye,* smiled Burlingame. \"Who better grasps the trials of sightlessnessthan he whose eyes are gone?\"\"But what teach? I know something of many things, and enough ofnaught.\"\"I'faith, then the field is open, and you may graze where you list.\"\"Teach a thing I know naught of?\" exclaimed Ebenezer.\"And raise thy fee for't,\" replied Burlingame.Ebenezer decides he's no teacher, and goes home to face his father. Andrew Cooke decrees that Ebenezer must apprentice as a clerk for a time in London and then sail to Maryland to oversee Andrew Cooke's estate there, Malden.Ebenezer has no talent for or interest in, clerking either: \"He would begin to add a column of totally meaningless figures and realize five minutes later that he'd been staring ata wen on the neck of the boy in front of him, or rehearsing in his mind areal or imaginary conversation between himself and Burlingame, or drawingmazes on a bit of scratch-paper. For the same reason, though he hadby no means the troublemaker's temperament, his untamable fancy morethan once led him to be charged with irresponsibility: one day, for example, scarcely conscious of what he was about, he involved himself entirely in a game with a small black ant that had wandered across the page.\"He spends several years in London and \"fares unspectacularly\" in Barth's words.He then gets himself into more trouble (he seems to have a knack for getting into trouble and dragging everyone around him into it). He falls in love with a whore, the humorously named Joan Toast, and refuses to pay John McEvoy, her pimp and lover, on the grounds that he cannot bring himself to pay for a woman he has fallen in love with.McEvoy then mails a letter to Andrew declaring that Ebenezer has been spending time with whores, not advancing in his job, etc. As a result, Andrew sends Ebenezer to Maryland.Before Ebenezer leaves London, he dresses up in his best (and humorously depicted) finery and pays a call on Lord Baltimore, persuading him to make him Poet Laureate of Maryland.Ebenezer commences to have many misadventures, including multiple captures by pirates, several near drownings, being robbed of all his worldly goods (several times), being captured by Indians, etc. He also commits a petty theft of his own after nearly getting in a duel with a stationery/book seller who drives him crazy by offering him too many notebook options (slim cardboard quarto with unlined paper, thick leather quarto with lined paper, etc.) Ebenezer hates options because, since they are all equally attractive to him, he can never choose between them. He encounters various shady characters (such as the aptly named Captains Slye and Scurry), shysters, quacks, shady lawyers, golden-hearted whores and disreputable women, pirates, thieves, spies, traitors, imposters, rebellious Natives and slaves, Indian kings, etc. But others often take Eben himself for a madman.The novel is a comedy of errors (albeit with a somewhat sobering postscript).The themes of trickster, criminals, and especially disguises and mistaken and faked identities pervade the entire book (as well as that of twins). We also have changes in social and cultural identities occurring on a regular basis (certain characters switch between being Indians and being English colonists; others morph from being servants to being gentlemen (and vice versa). Burlingame disappears and reappears at regular intervals in both England and Maryland. He assumes various disguises and identities (many of which don't become obvious until later in the book). He's a master trickster. He's also clearly a spy, although for whom is not clear until the novel's end. Orphaned Burlingame is also obsessed with finding his parentage and origins. Ebenezer helps with this task.The Laureateship causes multiple problems. It engenders numerous \"Ebenezer Cooke\" impersonators, who of course, also cause Ebenezer trouble.Also, coincidences abound (many of which strain credulity, but credulity is not the point here). Or as Barth puts it:\u201d Lest it be objected by a certain stodgy variety of squint-minded antiquarians that he has in this lengthy history played more fast and loose with Clio, the chronicler's muse, than ever Captain John Smith dared, the Author here posits in advance, by way of surety, three blue-chip replies arranged in order of decreasing relevancy. In the first place be it remembered, as Burlingame himself observed, that we all invent our pasts, more or less, as we go along, at the dictates of Whim and Interest; the happenings of former times are a clay in the present moment that will-we, nill-we, the lot of us must sculpt... Moreover, this Clio was already a scarred and crafty trollop when the Author found her; it wants a nice-honed casuist, with her sort, to separate seducer from seduced. But if, despite all, he is convicted at the Public Bar of havingforced what slender virtue the strumpet may make claim to, then the Authorjoins with pleasure the most engaging company imaginable, his fellow fornicators, whose ranks include the noblest in poetry, prose, and politics\"Ebenezer runs into many of the same people he met in London (or who showed up in others' tales) again and again in Maryland. Many of them turn out to have (previously unknown) connections to others in Ebenezer's life. Ebenezer also encounters new characters in Maryland , such as Mary Mungommery \"The Travelling Whore of Dorchester\" and Harvey Russecks, a trapper. There are a couple of key players who (possibly---we are never certain) never actually appear in person in the novel. We are not really sure if they exist or not. The themes of shifting and uncertain identities were also explored by Barth in Lost in the Funhouse There's plenty of meta here. There are innumerable (and very entertaining) tales within tales. In fact, it seems like almost every person Ebenezer encounters has a yarn to tell. There are also a couple of manuscripts (memoirs) within the novel, not to mention Ebenezer's poetry. Maybe that's why Barth insists this is \"postmodern\", although I really don't see that it is. Ebenezer does evolve through the novel. He goes from being a terrible poet to a pretty good one. He also realizes that the innocence he's set such store on is not worth as much as he thought. Innocence (and its loss) is also a theme throughout the book.This is a kind of picaresque novel crossed with a Bildungsroman. And it's remiscent of novels of that time period, such as The Life and Opinions of Tristram Shandy, Gentleman. Anyway, this novel is hilarious and great fun to read, although I do admit it seemed a bit long (although its length is probably appropriate for its epic sweep).Kevin Pariseau does an absolutely masterful job of reading the audio and voicing the different characters. I read along in the Kindle book and the PDF version, both of which are available free online, since I think this novel might now be in the public domain.Here's a link to the original poem: http://pages.uoregon.edu/rbear/sotwee...Thanks to Ian Pagan-Szary for this link. Also thanks to Ian for suggesting we do a \"buddy read\" on this, which inspired me to tackle this long book sooner rather than later."}, {"userName": "Mariel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/647547-mariel", "userReview": "We sit here on a blind rock careening through space; we are all of us rushing headlong to the grave.

I'll start to look at the kid to see if they are doing what I'm doing. I'll get distracted looking at the adult they are with and wondering what relationship dynamic they share that they aren't studying what they are doing. Why choose me? Then there's that feeling when someone is watching you and you feel pressured to give them that big laugh. They'll repeat the joke if you didn't laugh hard enough. Didn't you get it? It's hilarious! These feelings aren't conducive for that blissful wrapped up in a story feeling that I can't get enough. I don't want to be prodded into laughing over endless dick and fart jokes. I want to roll over and go to sleep and not wake up with a vegetable poking me into a further vegetated state.I can't remember the last time that I really laughed. I mean a full on bellyaching sidesplitting laugh. It may be me. My goodreads friends list seem to love this one to pieces. The whole thing and the ensuing of hilarity. If it were a film I'd expect the sound bites to read something like \"The thrill ride of the summer!\" and \"I laughed until I cried!\" Reviews all over the internet suggest it is a book to be loved. Ribald, raunchy, corset poppin', romps, sweaty, sheets, rolling, rollicking, over the side, walk the plank, tied up, buttered up, tarred, feathered, skinned, scalped, pokered, buggered, roped, raped, underneath, hole, fit it, in, penis, vagina, poop. Blah blah blah. It was okay enough, at first. I started out wondering why this blank faced young man was looking at everyone else in the movie theatre for his cue to look like he felt about anything. I didn't really find it hilarious but I wasn't desperately bored, yet. Have you ever read series fiction? And you have to get through a lot of boring bits that reiterate information from previous volumes? One that I used to read before I got bored with it was Michelle Sagara's Elantra series (an excellent example, if you are familiar with it, because I doubt it'll ever end, or at least it seemed that way when I gave up). Every damned time I had to sit through scenes of the lead character being late to everything. She's always late! Look, she's a klutz! Scene after scene of this. In case you forgot (which I hadn't). The Sot-Weed Factor is one book. I got really damned bored reading about stuff that just happened as if I had read about it years ago in an earlier volume when I hadn't because it was the same book that I was reading at that time (I read it while waiting all day and into night for emergency car service. If I had had ANY other book with me I would have given up). I guess it is probably a satire of serial series too? You know how back in the day (or now, if it is the awful The Hobbit film(s)) they would stretch out stories beyond (en)durability to milk out the most money? Yeah. I felt like I was rereading books that I read in my teen series or early twenties. I probably would be less moany about this one if I wasn't writing a review of it. It's the energy it takes to have a reaction to something and finding out you didn't really care that much. I don't feel like writing reviews of Tristam Shandy or any of the J.P. Donleavy books. I'm really reminded of Philip from Of Human Bondage. It's a \"history\" of a life, same as that book, and the hero is a cypher for a parade of other people's stories. I liked Megha's nicer way of seeing it that it was an echo of the storytelling nature of lives past. To me it felt like going from soap box to soap box to espouse whatever the author felt like talking about, and not much of a life for the hero. He's always looking to everyone else and then he writes about it. He would probably hold a quill to his lip and dream dreamy dreams about love and life and not understand any of it because he never lived any of it. Ebeneezer depressed me. I just saw him as some dick waving asshole confronting the prostitute Joan with his \"virtue\". It is supposed to be like this! Tell me what it is supposed to be like, somebody. Somebody live up to something so I don't have to get in the dirt. The poor girl on the ship that he is disappointed was not a virgin when the other guy rapes her before he had meant to rape her himself. (Like Phillip's entitlement to a hot girl despite his bum leg. It amazes me he's not seen as a dick for wanting a hot girl instead of the supposedly ugly girls who loved him but Mildred was evil because she wanted a hot guy instead of him.) I don't know. This is innocence? I saw a monster face hiding behind not having one. He wonders about his own halted desires and stilted virtues. Sure, he notices it to talk about it. Talking a lot and making claims on the future and meaning isn't innocence to me. Of course, the fictional Ebeneezer Cooke (there was a real one) likes to run around and call himself a poet (I grew so tired of how often Barth refers to him as \"the poet\" as a name). Names aren't art. Innocence would be living in spite of it and art would be making something in spite of it, or just having something else to live in along with it. Some place to go. What was all of these hijinks and antics and adventures and scenes scenes scenes saying? No, don't look at the face of the person next to you, Mariel. You didn't like it that much.His twin sister moves between serenity of listening to her father, or her brother, or their tutor Burlingame. Another no expression. She has Burlingame's baby and their neighbors believe it is her brother's child. They have to live with faces coming up with conclusions. I was interested from time to time in the horrors of indentured servitude. I am fascinated by the corruption and cruelty enacted on fellow men in \"contracts\" (not feeding people to \"save money\"). But then I never thought that colonization was a pure thing without warts on the ass. I sort of cared about Mary and the Inn-keeper's daughter. They tried to live anyway (mirroring the wet nurse who fell into trouble with a man because another authority male figure kept her locked up from life. So they took lives for their own). I liked that Joan could live as herself and like sex anyway, even as Ebeneezer hearing the story of the rape by trickery from her uncle (after her first bleeding) tells her that she should feel the horror and shame. I don't care about what anyone says anyone else should be feeling. There wasn't anyone alive then who didn't have to live with something. I guess I don't give any kind of damn about satirizing other novels. If they aren't living their life that says a lot more about them than it does about their teachers or parents or that life wasn't handed to them on a clean silver platter. I was just happy to finish it and never have to read it again.At least the prostitutes were diseased. It is refreshing to read about prostitutes in novels that aren't just dream girls for some man, no matter what Ebeneezer thought. It sucks and they do get haggard and have sexually transmitted diseases (Thomas Pynchon in Inherent Vice I am talking to you). Of course, I don't need an enormous book to tell me that either. I would have been better off reading a book about the colony of Maryland and imagining stories out of that myself then trying to squint and imagine history and stories out of why aren't you laughing? I just made another sex joke.P.s. I read The Sound and the Fury that is an intensely style focused novel obsessed with virginity after reading this intensely stylized novel about a man obsessed with his own virginity. Uh oh. Is this a sign of my wet blanket existence going further into my future? I never find Kristen's penis drawings funny. She thought I thought they were obscene and that's why I disliked them. I just didn't feel anything at all. Pubic hair in the pictures was too intimate for me, though. I can imagine it getting into food, for some reason. Burlingame's suggestion for vegetables and penis will ruin this vegetarian's appetite. I just don't find it funny. I feel nothing. I don't want to think about not feeling anything like I'm lacking. I just don't have the same sense of humor. Maybe this book is for everyone else and I'm on another ship going to another colony where they scalp Princess Tiger Lilly."}, {"userName": "Edward", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12933866-edward", "userReview": "Unlike many other reviewers, I did not have the experience of being pleasurably catapulted headlong into the world of Ebenezer Cooke and his associates. In fact, I struggled with this novel for hundreds of pages before I started to enjoy it. I dislike the particular style the book parodies and resembles, and found the plot and characters to be overtly silly, the adventures unbelievable. It took a long time for me to suspend my cynicism and allow myself just to roll with the punches. While the style never really stopped feeling like a chore to read, what won me over was simply the incredible story , whose endless twists and turns cannot but eventually ensnare and immerse even a resistant reader. By the end I was cheering for poor Ebenezer, and hoping for neat and satisfying conclusion to his misadventures. I ended up enjoying The Sot-Weed Factor despite myself, but was left with the feeling that the enjoyment was mostly superficial. The book does present some matter for contemplation, but on the whole there are not too many layers to tease apart. In this regard I think the novel is limited by its adherence to Seventeenth Century literary styles, which though charming in themselves, are perhaps not as nuanced or flexible as modern ones.

So have been many others. Maryland is infested with poet laureates called Ebenzer Cooke. Henry Burlingame, on the other hand, is singlehandedly filling many shoes as he goes on a Mission Impossible-esque spree of changing disguises. Joan Toast is diligently working at supplying pox to the Indians. King Hicktopeake's ravenous Queen had been keeping, not only the king, but all men in the town perpetually fatigued. Highly confusing provincial politics and conspiracies are constantly afoot. An uproarious cast of characters is strewn all over the province. Their paths often criss-cross in such ways as to make it look like a bad case of Twister - where the proprietorship of hands, feet, torsos is difficult to ascertain. Hilarity ensues.Unlearned in matters of the real world, Ebenezer Cooke soars high on wings of fancy and blissful ignorance. When forced to come up with an improvised bum-swab, he summons his knowledge of philosophy, history and literature. He has a way of jumping out of frying pan to land straight into the fire, a bit of a 'wrong place wrong time' syndrome. When he is is lucky enough, someone comes along to pull him out of the ditch, only to drop him into a bog later.\"His chair rose from the floor, passed through the roof of Malden, and shot into the opalescent sky. As for Maryland, it turned blue and flattened into an immense musical surface, which suavely slid northwestwards under seagulls.\"Perhaps my favorite thing about The Sot-Weed Factor is how it upholds the tradition of oral storytelling. Several episodes are incidents being leisurely related by one character to another, each story-teller adding a bit of his/her own color to the story. Some even care to drop a nugget of wisdom or two.\u201cOnly the wittol can know he is no cuckold and only a dead man is safe from death.\u201dSome of the stories being told are incredible enough to find a place in 'Ripley's Believe it or Not'. Many of the episodes that I was convinced could only be tall tales concocted to fool Ebenezer, turned out to be true. While some things I had believed, were revealed to be made-up truths. Who am I to call Ebenzer gullible then! There is no telling how the tide will turn in Barth's world. One small happenstance can set a contraption in motion leading to big, comic consequences.Barth's ribald, irreverent, comic adventure has a lot going for it. Except the length, methinks. After a point, it does exude a 'joke being told one time too many' feeling. In any case, I did make it to the end of the story where the oh so polite author apologized. Ebenzer's ordeal ended and he had a chance to lie down to rest and perhaps sink back into his dreams and reveries. \u201cTo me she is a woman.

I am hard pressed to decide what to like most about it, but I would choose the characters, and it has a slew of amazing characters. In his the Paris Review interview, in 1985, Barth was asked, about his perusing of the libraries at John Hopkins: Interviewer: In browsing the libraries, was it the concept of simply telling stories that fascinated you, or was it the characters that came through the works you read?Barth: It was not the characters. Perhaps I would be a better novelists in the real of characterization had it been.http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2910/the-art-of-fiction-no-86-john-barthI have to disagree with Ole John, here. I think he has some of the best characters I have ever had the pleasure to read about, hell, many of characters \"played\" multiple characters themselves. Even Ebenezer's father at one point was afraid he would change in front of his eyes:\"From time to time he cast(Andrew Cooke) great frowning glances at his children, as if they might vanish before his eyes or change into someone else.\" p. 712I think he is a master of character development. I loved his develoment of Ebenezer; I thought that Eben grew throughout the novel, and I did not like him at first, but he grew on me. Mary Mungummory is a sage of the world, and boy does she know whats going on in the world. Burlingame, a mastermind, thats all you need to know.Barth's story telling was great; he used stories within stories to tell his story.

The style could well be Fielding, except that Barth is even more hilarious.At a time when minimalist novelists seem to be in vogue, I revelled in the intelligent richness of the elaborate quixotic tale woven by Barth. When a novelist can write as well as peers like Saul Bellow or V.S. Naipaul, then a maximalist style like Barth's is to be savoured. Poor chaste poet laureate, Ebenezer Cooke, encounters harsh reality at every turn, including capture by pirates and Indians. His dreams drive him to ridiculous ends where his ambitions are constantly confounded by greater existential powers. \"The road to Heaven's beset with thistles, and methinks there's many a cowpat on't.\" The dialogue is delicious and well-constructed with an authenticity and wit and bawdy truth. You have to marvel at the construction of such credible characters as Joan Toast, Bertrand, Boabdil, Andrew, Pocahontas and the pirate captain. Barth's dialogue on various letters of the alphabet, the trading of ancient insults and the scene where Ebenezer fears drowning in Chesapeake Bay were uproariously funny. Barth obviously knows the Eastern Shore near the Choptank River intimately: it's a lovely setting for his novel.

A prospective reader asks about the kind of humor it contains and whether it suffers from an ailment of early (1960) postmodern literature from being \"bizarre to the point of fantasy.\" A definite \"no\" to that.This is the story of a new English immigrant, Ebenezer Cooke, who has become a tobacco merchant (aka sot-weed factor) in colonial Maryland at the beginning of the 19th century. He is absurd in feeling special virtue over his celibacy, but that doesn't stop him being curious over the power of lust. The man is delusional enough to aspire to writing a heroic poem about the presumed noble virtues of the colony (a real Cook did so, but nothing is know of him). He is puffed up over his own importance like a Don Quixote and self-blinded to the human misery and venality around him like a Candide. He makes a tour of the towns and country, interviewing people and intersecting with their capers as an innocent abroad. The viciousness and lechery of folks like Miles Standish, corruption of the governing class, and wisdom of prostitutes eventually gets through to his thick head. But we love him anyway as the sweet idiot he is at heart. He eats dirt to meditate on his new land. He actually does have poetry in his soul, overblown but sincere. Barth's cleverness and mastery of language come through his voice in these quotes stolen from the few by readers at the review page:\u201cIs man a savage at heart, skinned o'er with fragile Manners? Or is savagery but a faint taint in the natural man's gentility, which erupts now and again like pimples on an angel's arse?\u201d \u201cThe difference here 'twixt simple and witty folk, if the truth be known, is that your plain man cares much for what stand ye take and not a fart for why ye take it, while your smart wight leaves ye whate'er stand ye will, sobeit ye defend it cleverly.\u201d I see the book as a national treasure.

The novel itself draws on official archives of Maryland, but its historical account is animated by a whirlpool of imagination. The plot pivots and twirls with intrigue, counter-intrigue, masquerades, farce and melodrama, and adventure--lots of adventure. The characters are many, but primarily Ebenezer Cooke, his twin sister, Anna, and Henry Burlingame, a complex man of many guises.The dialogue alone I would award 5 stars--formal, yet hysterically funny, insightful, and often bawdy--I admit to having dialogue envy.This is a long novel, about 500K words, so it easily suits lots of themes:The existentialist notions of action, choice, and value.The lawlessness of early America with its connection to European political conspiracies complicated by a disregard for morality juxtaposition with desires for upper class wealth and prestige.Coming of age and the development of a coherent sense of self.Sex and society. (Women's roles, prostitution, rape, incest, buddy love, lust....)I could go on. For criticisms, I have 2. First, extensive text of a journal is produced on the page in all manner of glorious misspellings, which made for difficult reading, which amounted to me skimming.

No puedo m\u00e1s que relamerme los dedos y desesperarme con la (gozosa) espera.\u201cEl plantador de tabaco\u201d (\u201cThe Sot-Weed Factor\u201d) fue publicada en 1960 e inicialmente Barth la concibi\u00f3 como la conclusi\u00f3n a una trilog\u00eda nihilista, siendo las dos primeras novelas de la trilog\u00eda \u201cThe Floating Opera\u201d (1956) y \u201cThe End of the Road\u201d (1958); y tom\u00f3 su t\u00edtulo del poema \u201cThe Sotweed Factor, or a Voyage to Maryland, A Satyr\u201d de 1708 realizado por el poeta ingl\u00e9s Ebenezer Cooke (c. 1665-c.1732) del que pr\u00e1cticamente no se sabe nada.Resumiendo a grandes rasgos la trama, la novela (ubicada en la d\u00e9cada de 1680 a 1690 en Londres y Maryland) es una narraci\u00f3n \u00e9pica sat\u00edrica de la colonizaci\u00f3n de Maryland basada en la vida ficcionalizada de Ebenezer Cooke; honrado con el t\u00edtulo de Poeta Laureado de Maryland, y al que se le manda para cantar las alabanzas del proceso y que vivir\u00e1 una serie de aventuras en su viaje a la colonia ( \u00a1y en ella!) mientras preserva, con no pocos problemas, su virginidad intacta.Barth tambi\u00e9n ten\u00eda la idea de dar un epitafio al poeta, en sus propias palabras: \u201cThe Sot\u2013Weed Factor began with the title and, of course, Ebenezer Cooke\u2019s original poem. . . . Nobody knows where the real chap is buried; I made up a grave for Ebenezer because I wanted to write his epitaph\u201d. A pesar de lo comentado, el resultado final fue por otros derroteros. Como dijo Barth en 1994: \u201cLooking back, I am inclined to declare grandly that I needed to discover, or to be discovered by, Postmodernism.\u201d (\u201cMirando atr\u00e1s, me inclino a pensar mayormente que necesitaba descubrir, o ser descubierto por el Postmodernismo\u201d). A partir de ese momento, de hecho, las obras de los per\u00edodos siguientes se inclinar\u00edan cada vez m\u00e1s a la fabulaci\u00f3n, la metaficcionalidad, en conclusi\u00f3n: lo postmoderno.Tras leer la obra, no puedo m\u00e1s que estar de acuerdo con lo anterior. Y me gustar\u00eda incidir en lo que considero sus virtudes, aquellas caracter\u00edsticas que la hacen tan especial y, por qu\u00e9 no decirlo, una obra imprescindible del postmodernismo y, extendi\u00e9ndolo a\u00fan m\u00e1s, de la literatura universal.En primer lugar hay que tener en cuenta la estructura: la trama principal, ese tour de force de nuestro querido poeta, se convierte en un juego de cambios de identidad, mascaradas y equ\u00edvocos altamente humor\u00edsticos por momentos que alternan con digresiones, historias dentro de historias e incluso listas (esot\u00e9ricas, ingredientes de comidas, insultos\u2026). Se puede comprobar f\u00e1cilmente c\u00f3mo la historia comienza de una manera m\u00e1s realista (como en sus obras anteriores) y va desencadenando una narraci\u00f3n cada vez m\u00e1s postmoderna seg\u00fan avanza la obra: esas digresiones, esas historias dentro de historias, son elementos cl\u00e1sicos de este estilo. La novela toma como referencia los g\u00e9neros (y formas) del siglo XVIII y las parodia, imita, recupera y reescribe: en esta parodia entran el Bildugnsrroman o relato de formaci\u00f3n, el K\u00fcnstlerroman o relato de formaci\u00f3n de un artista y del g\u00e9nero picaresco, convirtiendo toda la obra, en s\u00ed, en una farsa sat\u00edrica de proporciones \u00e9picas. Luego volver\u00e9 sobre este tema, ya que hay que indicar para qu\u00e9 le sirve esto.En este texto que pongo a continuaci\u00f3n de la fabulosa traducci\u00f3n de Eduardo Lago (que adem\u00e1s hace el pr\u00f3logo y de la que proceden todos los textos que voy a reproducir) para esta edici\u00f3n de \u201cEl plantador de tabaco\u201d de Sexto Piso, encuentro dos hechos rese\u00f1ables:\u201cEn los a\u00f1os finales del siglo XVII hab\u00eda entre los juerguistas y petimetres que frecuentaban los caf\u00e9s londinenses un individuo delgaducho y zanquilargo llamado Ebenezer Cooke, con m\u00e1s ambici\u00f3n que talento y, sin embargo, m\u00e1s talento que prudencia, el cual, al igual que sus compa\u00f1eros de juerga, que en teor\u00eda estaban educ\u00e1ndose en Oxford o Cambridge, encontraba en los sonidos de la madre lengua inglesa m\u00e1s un motivo de juerga y diversi\u00f3n que algo con sentido, con lo que se pod\u00eda trabajar y, en consecuencia, en lugar de entregarse a los sinsabores de la erudici\u00f3n, el tal Ebenezer aprendi\u00f3 el arte de versificar, dando en desgranar, conforme a la moda de entonces, cuadernillos de pareados plagados de Joves y J\u00fapiteres espumeantes, entre el estruendo de las rimas estridentes y s\u00edmiles que de tanto tensar la cuerda, a punto estaban de romperla.\u201dUno, sin dudarlo, el estilo, que imita las formas de novelas anteriores de Fielding, Sterne y su \u201cTristan Shandy\u201d o de Samuel Richardson; requiere mayor esfuerzo lector por lo estramb\u00f3tico, por la r\u00e9plica del estilo antiguo; pero compensa debido al incre\u00edble lirismo de cada descripci\u00f3n, a la minuciosidad narrativa, al humor que destila en cada palabra, en cada met\u00e1fora. Una joya, de la que no te cansas y que te ayuda a disfrutar a\u00fan m\u00e1s. Dos, los personajes, este es el primer p\u00e1rrafo y asistimos a la presentaci\u00f3n, cu\u00e1l Quijote, de este poeta \u201cde pelo y ojos claros, huesudo, los p\u00f3mulos hundidos\u201d \u201chombre garza, de patas flacas y pico largo, caminaba y se sentaba con pose descoyuntada; su porte mismo era una sorpresa angulosa, cada uno de sus gestos, una semiagitaci\u00f3n.\u201dEl tri\u00e1ngulo de protagonistas que forma junto con Henry Burlingame (que en alg\u00fan momento llegu\u00e9 a identificar con Sancho Panza) y la hermana del poeta, Anna, llevan el peso de buena parte de la obra y son parte de su encanto; sin perder de vista al criado traidor, Bertrand, que le pone en m\u00e1s de una situaci\u00f3n comprometida y a Joan Toast, una suerte de Dulcinea grotescamente desahuciada, a la que ama sin reparo:\u201c-\u00a1Y vos sabed que os amo por ser mi salvadora y mi inspiraci\u00f3n! \u2013repuso Ebenezer-. Pues hasta esta noche en que hab\u00e9is venido a m\u00ed, jam\u00e1s fui hombre, sino un mero pat\u00e1n chocho y un currutaco; y hasta el momento en que os abrac\u00e9 jam\u00e1s hab\u00eda sido poeta, sino poetastro fatuo y huero. Con vos Joan, \u00bfqu\u00e9 proezas no ejecutar\u00e9? \u00bfQu\u00e9 versos no escribir\u00e9? [\u2026] Despreciadme, Joan, que entonces ser\u00e9 un loco egregio, un don Quijote que se tambalea por causa de su ignorante Dulcinea; pero aqu\u00ed os desaf\u00edo (si ten\u00e9is la vida y el fuego y el ingenio suficientes) a que me am\u00e9is sinceramente, como yo os amo a vos, y entonces luchar\u00e9 contra gigantes de verdad, y los sojuzgar\u00e9. Amadme y os juro lo siguiente: \u00a1Yo ser\u00e9 Poeta laureado de Inglaterra!\u201dNo se puede negar la influencia \u201ccervantina\u201d, patente en ese protagonista y en sus compa\u00f1eros; el ser conocedor del texto ayuda a disfrutar a\u00fan m\u00e1s de esta reescritura en clave sat\u00edrica. Tambi\u00e9n la \u201cIl\u00edada\u201d de Homero es musa inspiradora y nos lleva al hilo principal de la obra que adem\u00e1s se convierte en otra cualidad rese\u00f1able:\u201c\u00bfHubiera tenido el mundo noticia alguna de Agamen\u00f3n, o del fiero Aquiles, o del ingenioso Odiseo, o del cornudo Menelao, o del circo, todo lleno de griegos y troyanos que se iban pavoneando por ah\u00ed, de no ser porque el gran Homero habl\u00f3 de ellos en verso? \u00bfCu\u00e1ntas batallas de mayor importancia cre\u00e9is vos que se han perdido en el polvo de la historia por falta de un poeta que las cantara para la posteridad? [\u2026] Los h\u00e9roes perecen, las estatuas sucumben, los imperios se desmoronan; pero la Il\u00edada se r\u00ede del tiempo, y los veros de Virgilio son hoy tan verdaderos como el d\u00eda en que fueron compuestos. [\u2026] \u00a1Ser\u00eda una composici\u00f3n \u00e9pica como jam\u00e1s se ha escrito ninguna! \u00a1La Mariland\u00edada, por mi fe!\u201dDe la Il\u00edada deriva en esa \u201cMariland\u00edada\u201d y nos muestra su inter\u00e9s por ensalzar la labor del poeta y de la literatura en general como atestiguan estos momentos:\u201cEntre todas las artes y ciencias la literatura era la \u00fanica que ten\u00eda como dominio propio el campo entero de la experiencia y el comportamiento humanos (de la cuna a la tumba y a\u00fan m\u00e1s all\u00e1; del emperador a la puta barata; desde la quema de ciudades hasta el modo de luchar contra el viento), as\u00ed como los problemas de toda magnitud que afectan al hombre.\u201d \u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9n tiene m\u00e1s necesidad que el poeta de todos los dones divinos? El poeta posee el ojo del pintor, el o\u00eddo del m\u00fasico, la inteligencia del fil\u00f3sofo, la persuasi\u00f3n del letrado; cual un dios atisba el alma secreta de las cosas, la esencia que se oculta bajo la forma de las mismas, su m\u00e1s rec\u00f3nditos recodos. Cual un dios conoce las fuentes del bien y del mal: ve la semilla de la santidad en la cabeza de un asesino, el gusano de la lujuria en el coraz\u00f3n de una monja. Y a\u00fan voy m\u00e1s lejos: as\u00ed como el poeta es entre los caballeros como una perla entre piedras pulimentadas, as\u00ed tambi\u00e9n debe el Laureado ser un diamante entre las perlas, un pr\u00edncipe entre los pr\u00edncipes.\u201d\u201c\u00bfQui\u00e9n tiene m\u00e1s necesidad que el poeta de todos los dones divinos? El poeta posee el ojo del pintor, el o\u00eddo del m\u00fasico, la inteligencia del fil\u00f3sofo, la persuasi\u00f3n del letrado; cual un dios atisba el alma secreta de las cosas, la esencia que se oculta bajo la forma de las mismas, su m\u00e1s rec\u00f3nditos recodos.

Es l\u00f3gico, por otra parte, esta afinidad; no en vano la literatura es mi mayor pasi\u00f3n y esta idea est\u00e1 cargada de romanticismo literario.Barth, nada ajeno a la tradici\u00f3n norteamericana, no se olvida en esta obra de se\u00f1alar uno de los temas m\u00e1s recurrentes en la literatura norteamericana: la identificaci\u00f3n del protagonista con Ad\u00e1n:\u201cMe refiero a que lo que vos est\u00e1is haciendo es volver a representar la historia de Ad\u00e1n. Tanta importancia le conced\u00e9is a vuestra inocencia que por causa de la misma hab\u00e9is perdido vuestro para\u00edso terrenal. Pero a\u00fan he de llevar esta idea m\u00e1s lejos: vuestra aventura no solo os ha dejado sin hogar, sino que al igual que sucedi\u00f3 con Ad\u00e1n, hab\u00e9is probado vuestro primer bocado de Sabidur\u00eda y experiencia; de ahora en adelante no os ser\u00e1 f\u00e1cil coger frutos con que llenaros las tripas sino que ganar\u00e9is el pan con el sudor de la culpa, como hacen las masas humanas. Vuestro padres, si lo conozco bien, no dejar\u00e1 pasar esta ocasi\u00f3n de expulsaros del jard\u00edn del Ed\u00e9n.\u201dEste Ad\u00e1n americano, es colonizador, hombre hecho a s\u00ed mismo, ah\u00ed est\u00e1 el Sue\u00f1o Americano.Me encanta c\u00f3mo la obra, ya lo indiqu\u00e9 anteriormente, va avanzando en forma y temas, y evoluciona del realismo al postmodernismo; los momentos en los que me di cuenta de ello empiezan a aconteceren la parte final aunque empiezan con la falibilidad del recuerdo:\u201c-En suma, pues: \u00bfse es lo que se recuerda?-S\u00ed \u2013convino Ebenezer-. O mejor yo no s\u00e9 lo que soy, pero s\u00e9 que soy y que he sido merced a la memoria. El recuerdo es el hilo que ensarta los abalorios, constituyendo el collar; o como el hilo de Ariadna, del cual hizo entrega el ingrato Teseo: indica qu\u00e9 camino he seguido por el laberinto de la vida, me vincula con el punto de partida.\u201d (ese recuerdo, esa memoria se torna a\u00fan m\u00e1s falible seg\u00fan se avanza en la obra, por los trastornos de identidades)Y se extiende a la propia realidad como vemos en este di\u00e1logo entre Burlingame y Ebenezer:\u201cS\u00f3lo quer\u00eda dejar bien sentado que toda aserci\u00f3n sobre el t\u00fa y el yo, incluso de cara a uno mismo, es un acto de fe imposible de verificar\u201d a lo que Ebenezer responder\u00e1 anonadado \u201c\u00a1Santo cielo, tu discurso me ha robado los s\u00edmiles: no conozco nada que sea inmutable y seguro!\u201d: la realidad que conocemos, fragmentada, es irreal, nunca podemos conocerla de manera absoluta e inmutable, se resquebraja: \u201c-\u00a1Todo esto es sumamente cambiante y confuso! [\u2026] \u00a1Nadie es quien ni lo que yo creo que es! -Pasan muchas cosas \u2013asinti\u00f3 cr\u00edpticamente el criado- que a gentes como vos y como yo se nos escapan. Maldita sea si las cosas son los lo que aparentan.\u201dRealidad, apariencia y recuerdo se mezclan cada vez m\u00e1s y a la luz de este relativismo, se enfatizan cosas menos universales. Lejos todav\u00eda del inicio del postcolonialismo que surgir\u00eda en 1978 con la obra de Edward Said \u201cOrientalism\u201d; Barth, con todo lo indicado anteriormente acomete una reescritura postcolonialista de los cl\u00e1sicos para modificar y subvertir el di\u00e1logo tradicional; de ah\u00ed el uso de la parodia y la iron\u00eda; todo se convierte en una farsa, s\u00f3lo hay que ver el segundo nivel de lectura que nos da con los fragmentos de los diarios \u00edntimos de sir Henry (de 1608), que van pintando la historia del antepasado de Henry y que no es m\u00e1s que una reescritura del cuento de John Smith y Pocahontas aunque con \u201calgunas diferencias\u201d como podemos ver en este p\u00e1rrafo: \u201cComenz\u00f3 entonces Attonce a darse de palmotadas en la panza con el fin de despertar un mayor apetito de viandas y, en vi\u00e9ndolo, otro tanto hizo Burlingame, hasta que el estruendo de las tripas de uno y otro reson\u00f3 por sobre las ci\u00e9nagas como fragor de volc\u00e1n. Acto seguido, Attonce, cruzado de piernas, dio en rebotar con las posaderas sobre el suelo, para agradar a\u00fan m\u00e1s su apetito; hizo otro tanto Burlingame que no daba cuartel a su rival, y la misma tierra entremec\u00edase bajo el peso de sus espantables traseros. [\u2026] Y ans\u00ed estuvi\u00e9ronse un buen espacio, efectuando numerosos rituales con que azuzaban el hambre, en tanto nuestra compa\u00f1\u00eda los observaba, at\u00f3nita, sin saber qu\u00e9 estaban presenciando, e los salvages bat\u00edan palmas e danzaban en derredor, y Pokatawetussan miraba con lascivia a uno y otro rival.\u201dEn clave de humor, la lucha entre los dos comilones dar\u00e1 un ganador que desflorar\u00e1 a Pokatawetussan. Esta visi\u00f3n desarma el porte apuesto y viril de una persona de principios, un gran americano, para igualarlo con la tribu de indios; es ins\u00f3lito, pero se produce durante el texto una lectura en contra del imperialismo brit\u00e1nico dando a\u00fan m\u00e1s importancia a los personajes de otras razas y poniendo a los colonos al nivel de los indios. Por si no nos quedara claro, en la parte final el norteamericano clarifica la reescritura del texto: \u201cOtros\u00ed fue tan osado que me mostr\u00f3 una relaci\u00f3n escrita donde se refer\u00eda c\u00f3mo salv\u00f3 a Pocahontas , cuya relaci\u00f3n pensaba incluir en su mendaz Historia; aquella versi\u00f3n no hac\u00eda menci\u00f3n ninguna de la infamante desfloraci\u00f3n de la princesa, sino meramente daba a entender que la doncella hab\u00eda sucumbido al porte viril y hermoso rostros de mi capit\u00e1n. As\u00ed pues yo deb\u00eda fingir que cre\u00eda en aquella farsa burlesca y fue ello mismo lo que hame movido, con la esperanza de as\u00ed apaciguar mi angustiada consciencia, a llevar a cabo aquesta relaci\u00f3n verdadera en mi diario, en cuyas p\u00e1ginas ruego a Dios jam\u00e1s pose mi capit\u00e1n sus l\u00fabricos ojos.\u201dLa dicotom\u00eda \u201chistory-story\u201d se hace presente, cobrando a\u00fan mayor importancia la segunda parte (\u201cstory\u201d, esos cuentos dentro de otros cuentos) debido a la falta de fiabilidad de la primera.En un principio pens\u00e9 sobre todo en lo anterior como motivo principal de la obra, sin embargo, ya acabando el libro me encontr\u00e9 con esto:\u201cEl plantador de tabaco goz\u00f3 de una popularidad constante entre las gentes de letras de Londres, bien que no era la clase de popularidad que hubiera deseado su autor. Los cr\u00edticos lo consideraban un buen ejemplo de la clase de farsa sat\u00edrica entonces en boga; elogiaban la rima y el ingenio; aplaud\u00edan las caracterizaciones y lo grotesco de la acci\u00f3n\u2026, pero ni uno solo se tomaba en serio el poema.\u201dEn un texto como este donde todo es farsa, iron\u00eda y parodia, \u00bfpodr\u00eda pensarse que precisamente nos quer\u00eda mostrar algo serio? Seg\u00fan el texto de Edmund Fuller \u201cThe Joke is on Mankind\u201d para el New York times, con el que estoy bastante de acuerdo, quiz\u00e1 el autor quer\u00eda expresar a trav\u00e9s de esta obra lo que es la humanidad: una s\u00e1tira, un conglomerado de fragmentos que a veces no se pueden discernir y que constituyen, como nuestras vidas, una (tragi)comedia en s\u00ed mismos.Infinitas posibilidades y reflexiones las que nos ofrece esta obra que, en mi opini\u00f3n, es capital e imprescindible. Una obra mastod\u00f3ntica que constituye un hito \u00fanico por su influencia posterior y, c\u00f3mo no, por s\u00ed misma.
