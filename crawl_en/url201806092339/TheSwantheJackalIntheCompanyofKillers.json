I\u2019ve been meaning to catch up with the In the Company of Killers series for a while now, but I guess the release of Behind the Hands that Kill really gave me the last push. And what a ride it has been. I read The Swan and the Jackal in one sitting. I couldn\u2019t for the life of me put it down. Ever since we met Fredrik the \u2018interrogator\u2019 in Killing Sarai I was intrigued by the man and I was curious to learn more about his past and Seraphina. \n\n\u201cMy beautiful swan.

I started out a bit weird, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I would like this book in the end, but then the big twist and the gut wrenching feels happened. I cried. Yup. At 2am in the morning I sat in my bed bawling my eyes out and I have no regrets. Sometimes a book just needs to hurt real good. And it did. Angst, pain, violence. I\u2019m slightly surprised the author went there, but I have to say I\u2019m impressed. Might be because I\u2019m a huge Courtney Lane fan, but I appreciate a good mindfuck and can handle these kinds of turns of events. On the other hand I can absolutely understand why some people wouldn't like this book as much. Different tastes and maybe even the wrong mood can be a killer with this book. Pun most definitely intended.All in all, an emotional and very different read. I enjoyed it immensely and I'm going to continue with Seeds of Iniquity right away. That is all.

It's completely wrong to try and categorize it. It's one of a kind, dark, gritty and unapologetic about it. A journey to the most hideous places of a human soul where our inner child hides and cries himself to sleep. A story about abuse, killers and torturers.

A monster with a persecuted heart and a dead soul.\u201d\nWhile the majority of fans were anxiously awaiting Fredrik\u2019s book, I was on the fence about it. My apprehension had a lot to do with the sheer fact of what his story would include. Let\u2019s face it, this guy gets off on interrogating people in his dentist chair and then proceeds to remove their teeth with pliers. For me, I wasn\u2019t as taken with him as I was with Victor or even his hot pain in the ass brother, Niklas. I knew that 'gruesome' and 'handsome' was only some of the words that could be used to define Fredrik Gustavsson.\n\u201dI don\u2019t kill innocent people. I, while although a sadistic bastard and torturer and killer, have limits and standards.\u201d\n\n\u201dSeraphina is the epitome of darkness. And I need her back. She and I have unfinished business.\u201d\nThis story may not be one any of the fans of this series envisioned. I sure didn\u2019t expect the author to go this route but I have to give her props it wasn\u2019t your typical fall in love with your captor while learning their kinky sex ways and embracing under a rainbow type of story. Casia Carrington is imprisoned in Fredrik\u2019s basement because she has information on his wife, Seraphnia (coldblooded killer, traitor, etc.) for ONE YEAR! Casia is suffering from amnesia and can\u2019t recall her connection to the woman Fredrik seeks. It also appears that the dreaded Stockholm Syndrome has infected yet another book I have picked up. \n\u201dBut I happened to like where I am, confined in a sunless, starless, rainless room with only my thoughts for company on some days. I guess it\u2019s the price I pay for being in love with the Devil.\u201d\nAlong with keeping Casia, finding Seraphina, Fredrik works a few cases with the new Order headed by Victor Faust. Izabel Seyfried does indeed play a part in this story as well as Dorian Flynn, who I liked a lot! Just when you think you have a strong grasp on what is going on in the story J.A. Redmerski turns the tables on you!I really liked this change of events and I was glued to the story to see how things would play out. Well, things didn\u2019t end up under that rainbow and I can\u2019t say I was happy, but it was good story and I have to give the author credit for knowing what readers would expect and doing what the story called for in her opinion. Going forward it appears there will be a prequel for this story of Fredrik\u2019s past, which I may skip because I\u2019m just not that into him. But the moment that Dorian or Niklas' books are released, I\u2019ll be back!!"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6049062-jen", "userReview": "OMG! I am reeling from what I just read! Seriously, this book was the darkest in the series so far. (in my humble opinion!) Fredrik Gustavsson, aka: The Specialist works in Victor's new organization called the \"New Order.\" His job is to torture people to talk, and one thing about Fredrik is that he enjoys every single minute of the torture he instills onto others. In fact, he will go through withdrawals if he doesn't get an ongoing dose of making his victims bleed. Don't worry though, he makes sure that the ones that sit in his torture chair are guilty of some crime. That would be his main rule; no innocents. Pretty gruesome right?!!! So, how on earth can someone like the sadistic Fredrik be a hero in the story? Well, as with most of our anti-heroes, he has had some terrible things happen to him in his dark and disturbing past. He didn't become this way on his own. The monsters created a monster within himself, and he very well knows it.This story is Fredrik's and Seraphina. She was his wife that betrayed him six years ago; but their story isn't done yet. Fredrik can't stand the fact that she betrayed him, and he is looking for her. In the process of his search, he comes across a woman who may know the whereabouts of his wife. There is a huge problem though. Cassie doesn't remember anything of her past...nothing...not who she is, where she lived..zilch. She does have nightmares though, and guess who stars in them?? Seraphina does, and Cassie is so terrified of this woman that she has accepted that Fredrik has held her captive in his basement for a year. OOPS! Did I forget to mention that part?? Oh yeah, he has secretly held her captive in hopes that her memory will come forth one day, and lead him to his wife. Feelings begin to develop between Cassie and Fredrik though, and this makes him become very confused as to what he really wants. This was a very good read. The story held me captive the whole time I read it. I forewarn anyone thinking of reading it though, it is a lot darker than the first two. It left me with a major book hangover, and I am going to have to pursue a light, fluffy read next just to take me out of this head space. I don't regret reading it though. This series is explosive, and should have a slogan of; \"Expect the unexpected!!\" I kid you not, these stories take you on a roller coaster ride of emotions. \"The Swan & The Jackal\" has some major twists that set a very somber mood for the rest of the book after they happen. My heart bled for Fredrik by the time I was done, and I'm still teary eyed just thinking about this story as a whole. Brace yourself for a ton of feels, and some very hot, primal, and raw sex!!!! This book won't be for everyone, but if you are a reader that is determined to go through this whole series; then brace yourself...you are in for one hell of a ride!!!"}, {"userName": "Beatrice Masalu\u00f1ga", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4590441-beatrice-masalu-ga", "userReview": "Reread: October 2017Let me put this gif to summarize my feelings on rereading this book:Can I just hug Fredrik Gustavsson? *wailing* My goodness, his story wrecked my heart.

I think there are more clues for the seventh book than this one. -------------------------------------------First read: January 2016Nothing is more exciting than to hear the story of Fredrik Gustavsson -- The master torturer, The Specialist, The Jackal.  I got more curious and intrigued with him on Reviving Izabel. He is attractive, compelling, and clever but also dangerous. In the series, this is by far the  darkest story I've ever read. Brace yourself if you're going to read this book.Like Izabel, Fredrik had an awful childhood experience that traumatized him for life. He's a heartless monster. He became more of it when his wife and the only woman who can match him, Seraphina Bragado betrayed him. They have an unfinished business and he wants to conclude it. However, he needs to find her by imprisoning Cassia Carrington. She was a kind, innocent and loving woman. She brings the lightness in him and a total opposite of the vile and cruel Seraphina. The story is a total mind-fuck. What. the. heck. was. that?! It is something I totally didn't see coming. I just can't believe it. The twist left me conflicted, sad and brokenhearted. That revelation made me speechless. It is a bitter ending but I'm satisfied with it. My heart breaks for both of them. My fucking feels. I'm drained. I need a happy book right now.

Just like JA Redmerski says at the start of the book, this isn't a romantic book by any means. This book is about Fredrick... his search for his wife who betrayed him, destroyed him and broke his heart. It's about seeing the monsters that made him into what he is today; another kind of monster. It's about him using another woman's vulnerabilities to get the information he needs from her... how to find Seraphina. But he never could have been prepared for what he actually found in the end.It was beyond shocking. Complex and brilliant, all at the same time. JA Redmerski knows how to write a bloody good story. So even though this book is incredibly difficult to read at times, it's totally worth all the pain. But I have to warn you again, if you're looking for a light book, or romance, or a beautiful ending... you're not going to get it here.There is some great storyline progression with Victor, Sarai and the gang. I loved seeing Izabel (Sarai) again and she was so great with Fredrik. She was there for him when he wouldn't let another soul in. She didn't always tell him what he wanted to hear, but she was there nonetheless.

But she ultimately betrayed him and he's been hunting her for the last 6 years. That is until he finds a major clue, Cassia, whom he keeps captive in his basement.

He has been searching for her for six long years! He believes his prisoner he's kept in the basement for a year Cassia is the key to getting his Seraphina back. Cassia has no memory of her past and Fredrik will do whatever it takes to get her to remember. While this is going on Fredrik can't help to develop feelings for the kind and compassionate Cassia.Cassia is the exact opposite of Seraphina. Cassia is light to Fredriks darkness. Seraphina is his equal. She is as dark as him and has helped him control the darkness that is in his soul. Fredrik finds himself struggling with his love for Seraphina, and his growing feelings for Cassia\u2014because he knows that to love one, the other must die.My mouth flew to the ground around halfway through!!! I would have never guessed that!! That's my kind of writing!!! Will light win out over darkness, or will something more powerful than either further destroy an already tortured soul? You will have to read to find out! Start at the beginning of the series and enjoy your ride! You will not be disappointed!!I'm off to read the next book:))"}, {"userName": "\u2765Lil", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14097794-lil", "userReview": "****4 messed-up stars****While I was reading this book, I was listening to a playlist on repeat.

They spent two short but unforgettable years together, full of lust and killing and the darkest kind of love that two people can share.And then Seraphina was gone.It\u2019s been six years since Fredrik\u2019s lover and sadistic partner in crime turned his world upside-down. Seraphina went into hiding and has eluded him ever since. Now, he\u2019s getting closer to finding her, and an innocent woman named Cassia is the key to drawing Seraphina from the shadows. But Cassia\u2014after sustaining injuries from a fire that Seraphina ignited\u2014suffers from amnesia and can\u2019t give Fredrik the information he desperately seeks. Having no other choice, Fredrik has been keeping Cassia locked in his basement as he not only tries to get her to recall her past\u2014because she and Seraphina share it\u2014but also to protect her from Seraphina, who clearly wants her dead.But Cassia is a light in the darkness that Fredrik never believed existed.
