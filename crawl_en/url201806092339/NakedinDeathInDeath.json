The attraction here is the same as in the most of urban fantasy IMO. Mystery-solving, some world-building (in this case, futuristic instead of paranormal) - it all is only background noise. What you are actually anticipating is the heroine's hookup with some handsome hunk. (That's what I read urban fantasy for anyway.) And the hunk here is something special - (1) he is drowning in money; (2) super hot; (3) has morals; (4) buys the heroine stuff; (5) feeds her; (6) he adores everything about the heroine from the get-go; (7), (8), (9) and (10) HE SPEAKS WITH AN IRISH ACCENT. What's not to like, right?Unfortunately, Roarke never managed to work his magic on me. I thought he was controlling, patronizing, stalkerish even, always forcing Eve out of her comfort zone and himself on her (in that signature way - I am going to make you have the most intense orgasm you've ever had, no matter if you want it or not, because I know what you need better than you ). Plus, as I've noted above, the switch from mystery to romance was too early in the book. Quarter in, second meeting, and already \"her small, firm breast weighed gloriously in his palm\" and \"he wanted to forget the patience and control he'd taught himself to live by, and just ravage.\" This bodice-ripperish language totally killed my mood. At that point, I already knew how it would unfold, with \"throbbing,\" \"wetness,\" \"I want you but I can't\" and so on.Sorry ladies, but romance is not quite my thing."}, {"userName": "Val \u2693\ufe0f Shameless \u2693\ufe0f Steamy Reads", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11626803-val-shameless-steamy-reads", "userReview": "4 StarsThis was solid.Fast paced.Sexy.Fun.And old.Seriously though, there are, what, only 40 thousand books in the series after this one?

I've finally read the first book in J.D. Robb's, aka Nora Roberts', vastly popular In Death series, and now I understand why there's 30 books and counting...'cause it's an awesome romantic suspense/futuristic mystery thriller and very addictive. In fact, it's a good thing that I brought the first three books with me on my trip since I wanted to immediately jump into the second book after finishing this. I loved it! And all the flattering Roarke talk is totally justified because he's such a mysteriously delicious, sexy alpha hero! I wasn't convinced that a series could stay interesting and fresh enough with the same characters for 30+ books, but I don't think there could ever be enough of Roarke...he's that yummy!I'm not sure if I need to recommend this since it seems that just about everyone else has already read it, but if you like romantic suspense and/or mystery thrillers and haven't yet read Naked in Death, then I highly suggest it. But be prepared to get hooked on the series!

I knew that JD Robb also wrote as Nora Roberts and I had read another book by Ms Roberts and hated it ... so I was a bit wary about starting the In Death books. But I had heard great things about Roarke. Another reason that put me off reading this series is because he is Irish and, being Irish, if it is not done right, it drives me nuts. But she pulled it off. He is perfection. I am already up to book 19 but decided to head back to book 1 and do a quick recap of how they met and their initial reactions to each other. OMG. I loved it. \n... he turned his head, looked five pews back across the aisle and directly into Eve's eyes. It was surprise that had her fighting not to jolt at that sudden and unexpected punch of power. It was will that kept her from blinking or shifting her gaze. For one humming minute they stared at each other ...\n\n\"You fascinate me, Lieutenant Dallas.\"\nWe meet Mavis, Feeney, Whitney ... Summerset. Yes, I can see now how they started off on the wrong foot. Bit of a poker up his arse alright, Eve. But you take no shit from him.\nGalahad, she thought. Her white knight.\nI highly recommend this series.\nMY ORIGINAL REVIEW - DECEMBER 2105 ...\n****************************************Well, they say \"practice makes perfect\" - would love to know who THEY are. Read Nora Roberts years ago and thought it was the greatest load of shite I had ever read - an Irish themed book - I am Irish so a bit sensitive. So totally avoided her forever. Read some forums on Amazon and GRs about Roarke and Eve and thought who are they - In Death - J. D Robb aka Nora Roberts - NO THANK YOU. But then again I saw that a lot of my GR friends are fans of JD so decided to bite the bullet and jump on the bandwagon.... OKAAAAAY - Naked in Death- freaking loved it. Was this the same woman who wrote about and Irish girl who trained a horse for the Kentucky Derby - cannot even remember the storyline now cos it totally pissed me off. Irish people are not like Darby O'Gill and the Little People or like Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Far and Away or whatever it was ... OK, we see our kids progress through school and improve over the years and definitely Ms Roberts did this. Will I go back and read a Nora Roberts book after this/ Not sure, maybe, probably as I can see a definite improvement in her writing style.... so do not understand how many of you gave Irish Hearts such high ratings - us Irish coleens are not as dimwitted or innocent as she was ,,,, Deliver us lord from every evil!!! Now I am totally depressed cos I realise that if I have to read the whole IN DEATH series it is going to cost me a feckin' fortune. Goodnight. 23.20 here in Belgium so time for bed! ..... and if I had known it was set in the future I definitely would not have read it but it totally blends in and you do not notice it."}, {"userName": " Lady Jayne *~*The Beach Bandida*~*", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1453659-lady-jayne-the-beach-bandida", "userReview": "4 Stars - Also reviewed at: Lady Jayne's Reading DenOkay, here\u2019s the quick and dirty... well, sort of. \nNaked In Death\n is the first book in the daunting (almost 40 books!!... and still growing) \u201cIn Death\u201d series by Nora Roberts, writing as J.D. Robb. I kept putting off reading it, for that very reason. Though, after recent reviews by Goodreads friends who have joined the growing legion of \u201cRoarke Groupies\u201d, I was most curious to read this book to find out for myself what the fuss is over Roarke. While I do not feel I have reached full \u201cGroupie\u201d status, I think perhaps a badge of \u201cRookie Groupie\u201d is in order. ^_^What is it about Roarke? Well, it\u2019s not just that he is a mysterious, tall, dark and stunningly handsome \u201cbad-boy\u201d, or that he owns like\u2026WHOA! \u2026 20-something % of the world in 2058. It is his intelligence, confidence, drive and determination in getting what he wants - and he wants Eve. And who could resist his oh-so-sweet moments, like with the button and the coffee? *sighs* I won\u2019t say anymore so as not to spoil it for those who have not yet read this book, but fans of the series will know what I\u2019m talking about. ^_~I seem to recall, prior to reading this book, people expressing that they didn\u2019t really like Eve. Lt. Eve Dallas reminded me of the character of Charlotte King in the TV series, Private Practice. She is prickly, with a hard shell, and I just knew this had to have been developed as a defence mechanism against some trauma she had suffered previously. What Eve needs is the right touch, \u00e0 la Roarke. I actually really liked Eve, the tough chick.I really liked Eve\u2019s friend, Mavis. She was funny and provided the comic relief in the story, like for example, in the scenes below where Mavis and Eve are discussing Roarke: \u2018\"Is he good? Stupid question,\" she said quickly. \"You wouldn't have stayed otherwise. Wow, Eve, what got into you? Besides his incredibly energetic c**k?\"\u2019 \u2018\"Okay, but can you tell me if he looks as good in person as he does in pictures.\" \"Better,\" Eve muttered. \"Jesus, really?\" Mavis moaned and let herself fall onto the sofa. \"I think I just had an orgasm.\"\u2019Yes, that is the kind of effect that Roarke has. ^_^One of the issues I did have with the book was with the futuristic elements. For the most part, I did not actually feel immersed in the \u201cfuture\u201d, but rather, I very much felt like was reading a contemporary novel with bits of unexpanded and unexplained futuristic things dropped in, eg. references to \u201cAutoChef\u201d, \u201cGlida-Grill\u201d etc. without a bit more of a description of it. I mean, you can guess that this \u201cAutoChef\u201d prepares the food in the future, but do we buy the ingredients and put it in there and then a cooked Spaghetti Bolognese comes out? The \u201cGlida-Grill\u201d I assume is a futuristic New York hot dog stand that glides from place to place rather than being set up on a particular corner? While I didn't want an \"info dump\", I do wish the author hadn\u2019t just dropped names like that, as it took me out of the story, at times.Very briefly, ...speaking of \"briefs\", if you keep reading you will be rewarded further on... ahem... Right, as I was saying, very briefly, the plot involves Lt. Eve Dallas investigating a series of murders committed in the \u201cold way\u201d using \u201cantique\u201d guns. These are the guns of today, ie. revolvers, magnums, etc. Roarke is one of her suspects and this is how they meet. \"Up against the wall, Roarke, spread 'em!\" Well, it actually didn't happen like that... LOL Overall, I really enjoyed my first \u201cIn Death\u201d book and will certainly be reading more - Hey, I want to upgrade to full \"Roarke Groupie\" status! ^_^ - though I will most definitely be pacing myself. My Eve (Morena Baccarin):My Roarke (David Gandy) \u2013 Even though Roarke is supposed to have longer hair, I think David Gandy is certainly gorgeous enough and has that teasing \u201crich bad-boy\u201d look about him to suit Roarke\u2019s personality.

David was a delicious image to have whilst reading. ^_^And since this is NAKED in Death, the following images of Roarke are...*coughs*...well, a must, obviously. LOL Images kindly supplied by Rane.

Robb is an alternate pen name for Nora Roberts. I only read my first Nora Roberts' book about a year ago, and was--to put it mildly--pleasantly surprised. I'd always assumed that Roberts wrote cornball Walmart-paperback-romances for-your-grandmother, and when I saw a new book with \"Witch\" in the title, I figured she had jumped on the paranormal train, but was curious enough to check it out.It was kind of amazing.And with about 30 seconds of research I discovered that rather than \"jumping on the paranormal train,\" it was more likely that Roberts could be held responsible for making books with paranormal elements marketable in the first place. (<------assumptions make you look stoopid. FYI.)I really liked this book. BUT. The too forceful, borderline abusive love interest whose aggression is attributed to his sheer maleness that I was expecting in my first Roberts' book (b/c '70s - '90s bodice rippers you stole from your grandma's stash when you were a teenager) . . . Well, he was hiding out here all along.Roarke Nolastname (*rolls eyes*) is a smoking hot Irish self-made bazillionaire. Say that three times fast. Go ahead. Do it. He's also a textbook example of a male with abusive tendencies. I know this for FACT, b/c I volunteered at a battered women's shelter while I was in college, and before a place like that will turn you loose in the facility, they educate you. Based on that education, Roarke is one giant Red Flag: he has zero respect for personal space, he makes unilateral decisions about things any rational person understands are not decisions to be made unilaterally, he has fits of temper that involve grabbing, shoving, and shaking . . . Red flags . . . Red flags everywhere . . .And maybe that's the difference between a book written a couple of years ago and a book written a couple decades ago. B/c NAKED IN DEATH was written nearly twenty years ago . . . BUT it takes place in the only slightly distant future (2058, I think). So there's this sometimes interesting/sometimes uncomfortable combination of modern/future ideals and innovations coupled with surprisingly old-fashioned tropes.Like how our heroine Eve Dallas is as hard core and strong a female character as I'd expect to find in any recently published SFF or UF novel, who lives in a world with legalized prostitution (gov't regulated and taxed, naturally), but who also falls prey to Red Flag b/c hot DAMN.No, seriously. Hot DAMN.I fell prey too. Like . . . completely. And part of the reason for that is b/c Roberts does such a good job of developing Eve and Roarke that you understand why he's a Red Flag, but know that he'd never actually cross that line (even though your brain and statistics tell you otherwise). They're both damaged, victims of horrific childhoods who were made stronger in the crucible rather than broken. They understand each other better than anyone else ever could. For real. You can see it, feel it.Eve is the one woman who can change Roarke's playboy emotional detachment, and the fact that she has no intention of doing so only makes it more plausible.And that kind of masterful manipulation is what makes the other stuff easier to swallow.B/c there is lots of other stuff. LOTS: All of the secondaries are flat, stock characters. Instalust, which is believable, crosses the line into instalove, which is not. Eve's a cop; Roarke is a \"reformed\" criminal mastermind. I could put together a very strong argument that Roarke is the main inspiration for Christian Grey (I considered writing a nontraditional review on that vein, but didn't have the patience to follow through). And there's CORN. Cheesy '90s I'm-too-sexy-for-my-shirt corn:\n\u201cI thought this vintage would suit you. What it lacks in subtlety . . .\u201d He turned back, offering her a glass. \u201cIt makes up for in sensuality.\u201d\nUgh. Also, if you are particularly sensitive to sexual violation, especially the sexual violation of children, NAKED IN DEATH is not for you. I say particularly b/c pretty much everyone finds the notion upsetting, but as far as this kind of thing goes, it's not too bad. There is only one scene that I would label as graphic and it takes place in the context of an adult remembering past abuse, so if you aren't particularly sensitive, it's not any more unpleasant than any other mystery/thriller with psychos or whack jobs doing psycho/whack job things. There are other things as well, but you get the idea. Not that it matters, b/c I LOVED it. If I was making a purely emotional decision about this book, I would be giving it at least four stars. Instead, I'm forcing myself to be rational (b/c the handful of times I've gone with my gut, it's come back to haunt me). It's worth mentioning that I'm nearly finished with #6 after starting the series four and half days ago, and that speaks for itself, but I can also say that while IN DEATH remains a series with flaws, there are marked improvements, especially in the area of secondary characters. SO. Definitely worth a shot in my humble opinion. If you're intimidated by sci-fi, this is just sci-fi enough to have interesting gadgets and speculative changes in federal laws (like the aforementioned legalized prostitution). ALSO, if you're into audiobooks, definitely, definitely worth a try, especially if you can pick them up from your library, and I'd imagine most would have them considering how popular and long-running this series is. I'm notoriously anti-audiobook (b/c ADD), but I started listening to NAKED IN DEATH while roadtripping, and it easily held my attention b/c just that good."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "I see why Nora Roberts wrote under a different name for this mystery series because, even though there is a romantic element, this book is so much more than that. If they all follow a similar pattern, then I can also see the In Death series fast becoming a favourite. It was an interesting, disturbing, thought-provoking read with a very sweet and sexy romantic subplot.There are three key elements that make up this novel and make it the triumph that it is: a psychological murder mystery, a slowly built up and believable relationship, and a futuristic setting. The latter stood out to me first of all. There are a number of reasons why the author may have chosen to do this; perhaps for the freedom to explore criminal possibilities of the future or for the advantage of having a several decade gap in which to invent her own fictional series of happenings such as laws that have changed and technologies that have been developed. But whatever her reason, the result is very effective.Robb doesn't really pass judgement on this fictional future. She tells us how it is, some things you'll undoubtedly think are better and some worse. The future in Robb's world contains a political battle over numerous moral issues like the right to bear arms in America that has been abolished at the time in question. The author gives all her characters strong voices and opinions while still managing to sit on the fence. This isn't a bad thing at all. What she does by this is gives the reader something to think about and question without steering them in a particular direction through political propaganda. My mind was whirring all over the place during this novel, I ate up and entirely believed in the world Robb had created. She's very cleverly subtle and doesn't stretch her future to some sort of technological extravaganza. No flying cars. No teleporters. If you're a hardcore sci-fi fan you might be disappointed, but I was completely convinced by it all.As for the murder mystery, well, it was pretty horrifying at parts. In this future, prostitution is legal as long as you obtain a license (you are a 'licensed companion') and the killer is targeting these prostitutes in a series of cold, calculated murders. It is Agent Dallas' job to find out the truth: are the deaths done for personal issues? Political? Both? Or is it some random sociopath who gets a kick out of bloodshed? Guess you'll have to read it to find out! But it's more than that, Agent Dallas has some personal issues from her past that make this case particularly important to her. On that note, I love her as a protagonist. She has a strong character, a sharp tongue and a secret desire for one of the main suspects of the case.Like I said, this should not be written off as a romance or 'Romantic Suspense', it is simply far more than that. But the relationship between Agent Dallas and Roarke is worth mentioning, it was wonderfully told and his aloof but amusing sexiness was more than a little irresistable.I'm so excited about this series and can't wait to read more. It so very much deserves the high average rating: read it!"}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "I finally get to cross this one off my TBR shelf - and I quite enjoyed it!! :)For being written in the 90s, this holds up pretty darn well. In a way, there may not be a whole lot of uniqueness going on - it's a cop murder mystery - but it flows quite well and kept my interest. I grew to like Eve, the police lieutenant, and Roarke, the roguish millionaire (billionaire?) who is more complicated and interesting than he first appears.I am definitely interested in continuing the series. It's only a tiny bit \"sci-fi,\" as it takes place in the near-future (maybe 50 years from now). There isn't any techno babble and it's all on-planet. I would barely consider this sci-fi, actually. But it was an enjoyable read. Roarke is a sexy male lead and Eve grew on me. The subject matter of this one is pretty dark (sexual murders), but it isn't too graphic. The sex was steamy enough for me, but not smutty. I think this was an *excellent* example of a strong female character who wasn't written into a damsel in distress role. I appreciate that.

It had everything, a kick-ass heroine with a bad past, a powerful, slightly shady and richer than Midas hero, a great mystery and a serial killer, all that set in a futuristic world which was surprisingly well thought and realistic for a book written 20 years ago when even cell phones were a rarity. Also, despite the Sci-fi setting JD Robb does not make the mistake of overwhelming the reader with too much information about the discoveries and changes over the years. The world-building is smooth, with just enough details for the reader to coprehend what everything that's mentioned is but not enough to get fed up with info.The mystery aspect of the novel was quite good. I had a new suspect every few pages, and still managed to be surprised when I found out who it was. I also loved how the author managed to write a book who was basically full of investigative work and not make it boring. To be honest, I've gotten used to UF where you have plenty of fights and magic to make the book more interesting so I wasn't sure if a good old suspense would do the trick. No fear there anymore.My one tiny objection was on the romance side. Although I do love Roarke and Eve together, I thought the romance progressed way too fast. The series already has 40 books and no end in sight, so it could afford to prolong the \"falling in love\" a little. A little more tension and reluctance would have made it more believable and less mushy. Still, that wasn't enough to make me reduce the rating.******************************************************This book comes highly recommended from plenty of friends and my only GR friend who didn't like it was daddy, which really is more of a recommendation than anything else *bats eyes innocently*, so...book you better be good!"}, {"userName": "UniquelyMoi ~ BlithelyBookish", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1113032-uniquelymoi-blithelybookish", "userReview": "Spectacular!!!5 stars! No, wait! 5+++++ Amazing, Thrilling, Provocative Stars!The Story - Naked in Death is the first book in J.D. Robb\u2019s insanely popular In Death series. It\u2019s a fantastic mystery thriller and once I started, I couldn't put it down...errr...turn it off! It is the year 2058, and technology now completely rules the world. But New York City Detective Eve Dallas knows that the irresistible impulses of the human heart are still ruled by just one thing-passion. When a senator's daughter is killed, the secret life of prostitution she'd been leading is revealed. The high-profile case takes Lieutenant Eve Dallas into the rarefied circles of Washington politics and society. Further complicating matters is Eve's growing attraction to Roarke, who is one of the wealthiest and most influential men on the planet, devilishly handsome... and the leading suspect in the investigation.I\u2019m not usually a fan of the Mystery/Thriller genre, but my daughter has been raving about these books for years. While at the public library perusing their audio book collection I came across Naked in Death, and with 4.12 stars after 57,000 ratings, I decided to give it a try. \nWOW! I am so, so very glad I did!\nThe world Ms. Robb has created is just futuristic enough to be compelling and believable, but not so complex as to intimidate or turn off those amongst us who are not fans of SciFi. The cast of characters, especially - be still my heart - Roarke, and Eve, are so well developed, so fully fleshed out, that I felt as if I knew them. As if they were people who were somehow part of my life. I wasn't just listening to a story, I was there as the story unfolded!The Audio - I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m fairly new to audio books, but I know what I like and what I don\u2019t. I didn\u2019t like this - \nI. Loved. It!!!\n Susan Ericksen does a phenomenal job of bringing the cast to life. She\u2019s an incredible talent and gives each player a distinctive voice and personality. Honestly, only one word describes her narrative skills. \nBRILLIANT!\nI need to mention, though, that while there is some romance and relationship building between the mysterious, sexy, drool-worthy Roarke, and Eve, this is first and foremost a murder mystery.Updated here:  I've changed my mind! This is an amazing romance! Maybe it was because I'm not used to reading stories with so much genuinely plausible violence, that essence of the story stood out more than the romance. But now that I'm doing a re-listen while waiting for book 2, and focusing more on Roarke and Eve, there's no way there is just \"some romance and relationship building.\" It's off the charts!The Bottom Line - If you\u2019re a fan of whodunits, you need to get this book. If you enjoy stories that have a futuristic element without space wars with little green men, you need to get this book. If you\u2019re looking for something different from your usual reads, something to get you out of a reading slump, you need to get this book! You know what? Just get this book. Whether you're going to read or listen, \nJUST. GET. THIS. BOOK!!! \nThere are not enough words to describe how outstanding and entertaining this book is.

Most of the mystery is pretty good, even though I thought the bad-guy was obvious. I think it's all of the futuristic stuff that makes it more interesting.

We have a dowdy, boring female who is suddenly thought to be the most desirable female on Earth to a guy who would never look at someone like her twice.

Yeah, they're great...But, other than the fact that I found the romance hard to believe, I still enjoyed this book.

LOVED LOVED LOVED it. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0fI\u2019ve been missing these two. Going back to the beginning of a series that I LOVE. \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f************I loved Naked in Death which is book #1 in the In Death Series by J.D. Robb. As I write this I can say I loved book #2 as well (I\u2019ll be writing a short review soon). And I am on to book #3 and loving it already. A lot of love going on here but rightfully so. I sure hope it continues through the 40 or so books within this series. YES I said 40!! I am anxious to see how J.D. Robb will pull off keeping her readers engaged. I will say the writing is fantastic. The characters are intriguing and fascinating. The plot had depth and she kept me guessing almost to the end. I found that I enjoyed the fact that it is set in the future. Very clever. I\u2019m also interested in the side characters as well. A butler of sorts, a friend and a co-worker are all subtle threads adding in peculiarities of their own. In a lengthy series like this I think it is so important the surround he H & h with such characters.I instantly fell in love with Lieutenant Eve Dallas our heroine. She is a woman of many layers. Eve is very tough on the exterior and maybe even a little tougher on the interior. But there are the moments where we see the slightest crack in her armor and get a glimpse at someone a little softer and with a sense of humor. Eve very rarely lets anything or anyone come between her and the case she is working on. It would be a first for her when she finds herself succumbing to a man. This man I mention is Roarke. When he becomes a suspect in the murder case she is working on we find Eve in a bit of a predicament. Being a wealthy, sexy and handsome man doesn\u2019t make her job easy. She would never do anything to compromise the job she has to do but the attraction she feels for him becomes almost too much to fight. The murders are a bit gruesome and a tad creepy. I was completely enthralled with everything that was going on. From the suspects to the weapon to what was driving this person to kill. It was crazy!This one was definitely a winner for me. As I said I have moved on and I am still enjoying this series. For all of you that enjoy RS get to this series soon."}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "I liked this as a mystery just as much as I liked it as a romance. Love a good mystery that keeps me guessing. I had my ideas about who the culprit was, and I was more or less right, although I had that kernel of doubt. I liked how this was a very well-plotted mystery. I think that it helped that the underlying aspects were so dark that I didn't think the story would go there. Eve is a great protagonist. She's tough, intelligent, but vulnerable in some ways. She's a very good cop, and she goes after justice, and she's refreshingly down-to-earth. I can identify with the fact that she lets work take over her life, and I'm glad that Rourke is there to make that harder for her to do that. Speaking of Rourke....He was nice...real nice. Of course, I'm understating the case. I like that he didn't let Eve's issues stand in the way of their relationship, but he wasn't out to change her or remake her into a more manageable woman for his life. What attracted him to her was what he continued to admire about her. I love a guy who isn't afraid of a strong woman. I like how he's very supportive and caring for her, and he can get tough with her emotionally when it's necessary. If he wasn't able to, he never would have made it past the titanium barriers she keeps up. He gave up off a good future husband vibe loud and clear. It cracked me up that every time they would look up information on a company, Rourke owned it. I think his net worth should be more than 3.8 billion, since he owns pretty much everything. He's like a Harlequin Presents hero, the billionaire businessman who is too hot to resist. Rourke's larger than life personality and his developing relationship with Eve made an appreciated counterbalance to the mystery involving horrible misogyny and violence against women. Even in the future, things didn't change that much. The same forces at work in the present world are involved, hiding their ugliness behind a squeaky clean facade.I liked the futuristic elements. They were well-written and believable, but they weren't distracting to the mystery elements. Used very well to give me a good visual of the setting. And since I love noir mixed with most genres, the future noir in this book went over great for me.I can't say I'm a big Nora Roberts fan, but I definitely like this series, and I want to read more of them.

Fans know there are a great many of them now. I read the synopis on the back of the book and was instantly put off by the futuristic setting. I really don't like Science fiction and anything set in the future. History is my big thing. But, I kept hearing how good these books were, so I picked up a used copy of the first one and could not put it down. Now, if you have read Nora Roberts and think this is some extension of her other stuff, think again. I was shocked by the language and the just little bit of kink thrown in there. I couldn't believe this was the same author. ( It wasn't over done, just not her style when writing as Nora Roberts.) But, when you stripped it bare, it was a detective/crime drama set in the future with a little romance thrown in for good measure. I hear maybe Roarke makes a return in her next installment. I sure hope so. Eve Dallas is a take no prisoners detective. She can't remember anything before her eighth birthday. But, has memory flashes that hint at abuse. Eve would rather not remember. When a \"paid companion\" is murdered, her prominent family wants Eve to investigate. One of her first suspects is a billionare that was seen having dinner with the victim. Then two more women are killed. Corruption within the force,politics, lies, blackmail and murder. It's all there. Plus, Eve is finally able to start dealing with her own troubled past.If you haven't read these books, I highly recommend giving them a try."}, {"userName": "Rachel Reads Ravenously", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14514998-rachel-reads-ravenously", "userReview": "2 stars Unfortunately this book just wasn't for me.

But I wanted to give this series a chance.I happen to be in a reading/reviewing slump, it's hard for me to review book that were just \"meh\" for me. So I'm going to break this down.What didn't work:-the plot: it was all over the place, half romance half murder mystery. It never really settled-INSTALOVE-poorly written sex scenes -poorly written \"romantic scenes\"-murder mystery pushed into subplot in 2nd half of bookAND (don't kill me ladies)...I didn't like Roarke.Maybe I just was anticipating too much from him? All he had going was he was rich, hot and into Eve. That was about it...........................................................................What I liked about the book:-Eve: a very complex, strong female character that is well written.

There's about a billion books out in the series. What if I ended up loving it? Then I have to commit myself to buying those billion books just to catch up! But after hearing such glowing things about this series from most of my Goodreads friends--especially about Roarke--I had to finally bight the bullet and get the first book. Now that I've finished it I don't know whether to cheer or comfort my wallet. I think I'm going to have to run to the bookstore and swoop up a bunch of the next books in the series so I can get my glom on.I didn't connect with Roarke the way that most readers seem to, but I expect it comes with time. The relationship and attraction in this book develops pretty quickly--faster than I expected or wanted--but I can't say I expected any different seeing as this isn't actually a Romance series. Most of the focus was on the case with the romance as the side story. Luckily, I know there's plenty of time in this series for the author to develop their relationship. It's no hardship for me to watch their relationship develop over the course of the books since I know that they are together and the author didn't throw any retarded love triangles in there. So I'm willing to be patient and won't complain about the lack of a lot of depth to the relationship and characters yet.It was odd for me to read a book so similar, yet different, from Nora Roberts's usual style. The characterization, interactions, feel to the developing relationship, and writing felt the same, but the focus wasn't on the romance. I liked it. It's nice to find a new series by this author that I can glut myself on. I was a little nervous that her style would be completely different under the pseudonym, but it wasn't where it counted.The details about all the little futuristic gizmos weren't really explained in depth. Everything was mentioned matter-of-factly like talking to someone already familiar with the technology and world. I think some will dislike that, but I honestly preferred it. I don't mind if authors want to explain, but a detailed explanation about how the spray that seals in oils and fingerprints works is not something I personally need to know. The way it was all presented worked for me.The case (and Eve's background) really tugged at my heartstrings. I thought it was handled well by the author, but I still feel helplessly enraged to know stuff like that happens constantly.I really enjoyed seeing our timeframe discussed and researched for the case. It was fun to see the differences between that time and this one and it provided a nice opportunity for me to see where their culture differed without huge infodumps.Now to go get my hands on Glory in Death..."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "This is a reread for me but the last time I read it was probably 1998 or thereabouts.

It introduces us to our two most important characters, begins their delightful relationship and sets the scene in a fascinating futuristic world. Some of the side characters also appear in this first book and we begin to discover the awful past which is Eve's driving force. I know the story well but still reached for the tissues when Eve disclosed some of her history to Roarke.

I soon realized my mistake, though. While each book can easily function as a standalone, missing even a word of this enchanting series is a crime. So here I am, going back to the beginning, meeting Eve and Roarke in their early days and sharing their journey from the start. Naked in Death was first released in 1995, but it\u2019s still fresh and innovative today, which tells you everything you need to know about it. It\u2019s set in a futuristic version of New York, 2058 to be precise, but the reality isn\u2019t so different from today. Yes, people have expanded their activities and moved some of them to various other planets, and technological developments have moved forward just enough to make them interesting even 20 years later, but human nature has more or less remained the same.Enter Lieutenant Eve Dallas, a competent homicide detective. She handles the most complicated cases with unwavering dedication and a strong sense of justice. Her own past is incredibly painful, which left her emotionally closed off, but when it comes to her victims, Eve has all the compassion in the world. In Naked in Death, Eve investigates the murders of three prostitutes. Cold, vicious, calculated crimes, all videotaped and left for her to find. Her investigation takes straight to one of the richest men in the world \u2013 Roarke \u2013 but as hard as she tries, Eve just can\u2019t see the honest, competent man as her killer. Naked in Death has a strong romance, yes, but it\u2019s so much more than that. The case Eve investigates isn\u2019t just something to fill the pages between romantic encounters. If anything, it\u2019s the other way around. These murders are painful, well planned and with a huge emotional impact for both Eve and the reader. In addition, Robb gives us splendid characterization on multiple fronts. It\u2019s obvious even in this first installment that she\u2019s building her characters to last. This series is up to its 40th installment now, and each one is better than the last. There is no noticeable decline in quality or intensity, which is not only rare, but absolutely brilliant as well. The descriptions can be a bit wordy at times, but they only add to the impression that we\u2019re dealing with much more than a simple murder mystery/romantic suspense. After all, this is Nora Roberts we\u2019re talking about. She can do so much more than that."}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2337007-brenda", "userReview": "Lieutenant Eve Dallas had been on the force for ten years and in that time had seen it all \u2013 or so she thought.

But find the killer she would..High on her list of suspects was a man she hadn\u2019t come across before \u2013 Roarke, a handsome Irish billionaire \u2013 and she was drawn to him; him to her. But it went against everything Eve was to succumb to his charms; especially in the midst of a murder investigation. Naked in Death is the very first in the In Death series by J.D.

If you\u2019re fortunate enough, you might even find a good prolific writer. Nora Roberts/J.D. Robb is one of the best. There is one problem though\u2026it\u2019s expensive to become a fan. It can be intimidating to find an author that is already established. In the case of J.D. Robb, we\u2019re talking about a series that is heading towards 45 books ALREADY. That is a lot of moola, and when you\u2019re at #1 it can even put you off starting the series. It has the potential to start you on an adventure of epic proportions...or...an addiction where you may never see the light of day again. Well, in my case, I read #1 and #2 a wee while back and enjoyed them, then I got distracted\u2026next thing I know we\u2019re past 30 and 40. I\u2019m stressing that there is no way I can catch up, let alone afford to catch up. So, I put the In Death series on hold determined that I will get back into the series\u2026soon\u2026ish.WELL, THAT DAY HAS COME!!I have a shocking memory and back in those days, I didn\u2019t write reviews so it was back to square one and re-reading from the beginning. I had heard good things about the audio version, so I splurged and stepped forward in time and met Eve Dallas and Roarke. Now, remembering that I have a shocking memory, I vaguely recalled some of the details as I went along, but it was more like a first-time read, to be honest.I enjoyed it. The problem is that when you start an already established series that has been around for a few years, it can seem a bit dated. What makes it even weirder is that the story is set in the future. So, while it\u2019s attempting to be shocking with new and exciting technological advances, in some ways, it\u2019s not that new and exciting anymore. We\u2019re kind of already there and it\u2019s not 2058. Obviously, it\u2019s not the author's fault, but I wasn\u2019t left gasping in awe and wishing for it to be 2058 now.The storyline, while probably shocking when it was first released, isn\u2019t that shocking now. There are plenty of stories with miserable characters who get off on power and use their authority to get away with a crime. Sure, the crime committed in this one turned my stomach, but again, I\u2019m not shocked by it. Maybe \"dark\" has become more mainstream...or...maybe authors are feeling more accepted in revealing their darker side (while still staying in the Romance genre).Naked in Death provides us with an intriguing look into the future. We get to see a serial killer case as it plays out and how the police will solve it. The dialogue, storyline and characters are interesting. The steamy scenes between Dallas and Roarke show an intense connection between two people not used to feeling anything more than sexual satisfaction. I loved that Roarke knew way before Eve that he was in for the long haul. Their coming to terms with having a relationship was quite amusing. I enjoyed meeting the additional characters and hope some of them will pop up in future reads.I'm looking forward to going on with the series but it will take time\u2026lots and lots and lots of time. I will not be reading them one straight after the other because I can't afford to not see the light of day for the next month or two. I will continue listening to them. The audio price is not much more than the Kindle price (which is bloody scary). So, listening to them should take me approximately 10 years\u2026and I may not be joking. I kind of wish that I could have the first 30 downloaded into my brain and I\u2019ll start reading/listening from 31 onwards.

There was also some interesting conversations about guns and gun violence in this book, which is very applicable right now with all the gun violence legislation being discussed in Florida and nationally right now. So all that together kind of kept me from being immersed in the book fully if I am being honest.But ignoring that, I did like this book but I just didn't love it. The L-bomb gets dropped way too soon, the main detective almost solves nothing herself really, and the villain is pretty darn obvious all along. BUT....I like the setup of the world and the romantic relationship and the insight into her past, so I'm interested enough to continue to read on.

Robb's number-one New York Times-bestselling In Death series, featuring New York homicide detective Lieutenant Eve Dallas and Roarke.  It is the year 2058, and technology now completely rules the world. But New York City Detective Eve Dallas knows that the irresistible impulses of the human heart are still ruled by just one thing: passion.  When a senator's daughter is killed, the secret life of prostitution she'd been leading is revealed. The high-profile case takes Lieutenant Eve Dallas into the rarefied circles of Washington politics and society. Further complicating matters is Eve's growing attraction to Roarke, who is one of the wealthiest and most influential men on the planet, devilishly handsome... and the leading suspect in the investigation.", "title": "Naked in Death\n      \n          (In Death #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/479309.Naked_in_Death", "average": 4.12, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333326143l/479309.jpg", "reviews": 4848, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17065.J_D_Robb", "name": "J.D.
