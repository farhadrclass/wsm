Her study examines the experiences of 100 working class young adults as they attempt to engage with the US economy in the years after the financial crisis of 2008. The methodology appears to be qualitative - interviews based on an interview protocol. The statistics seem basic here.Silva has a number of really interesting findings that all focus on the \"coming of age\" stories of the participants. The basic result that is most interesting to me is that while these youth must face the current jobs crisis among working class people, they maintain a frame of reference and norms that are consistent with more traditional work place norms. The two sets of norms - present and past -- and not consistent. This tension has ramifications for the emerging adult lives of these participants, including a reluctance to commit to interpersonal relations and a suspicion of most workplace relationships. Working class youth perceive high risks in their immediate situations. They also trust few people in confronting those risks. Moreover, members of the sample were likely to not just endure their tough times but also to justify their life results in terms of neoliberal norms of unattached individuality. In reading through these largely depressing results, one wonders what it will take to reorient this generation more positively towards the economy and government.The author's judgments seem generally sound although this is not uniform in the book. The initial results on conflicting norms and a class structure seem very reasonable. The conclusions on the therapeutic bases for new identities in the current economic crisis are less plausible.My biggest problem with the book is one common to all qualitative research -- namely how to distinguish between what the data are revealing and the author's interpretive framework in working through the interview results. Someone wise one said that \"thick description is a license to kill\". This suggests a need for clarifying what is author opinion and what is not. The sample is also not random at all, so it is hard to know what type of a cross-section that author really worked with. In defense of Silva, however, her results on the propensity of working class young people to accept and justify their hardships as personal failings rather than systemic inequities, is enlightening and rings true with my experiences.It is a dissertation, so don't expect an exciting book, and there is a little too much reiteration and repetition and restating of key points along the way. This study is fairly well done, however, and relevant to a variety of policy issues, such as how assist the college careers of working class students without a family tradition in higher education.Overall, this was an interesting book and worth the time."}, {"userName": "Daniel R.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2130032-daniel-r", "userReview": "A fascinating exploration of young working-class adults and what it means to come of age in today's society. One of the central themes is that traditional markers of adulthood such as education, employment, marriage, and children have been replaced with individual narratives that each person must explore and define, often without institutions helping to get the knowledge, skills, credentials, or money to better themselves. This self-reliance is set against a society that is shifting risk away from institutions and onto the individual, such as the move from pensions to 401Ks. As a result many of those interviewed felt completely alone, responsible for their own fates, and dependent on outside help at their own peril, leading to conscious decisions to not be romantically involved. The interviews are woven throughout the book with excellent context and well written discussion."}, {"userName": "Denali", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1156659-denali", "userReview": "If all Jennifer Silva did was write a well-researched very readable academic work that would be enough to celebrate her book, but she's done much more than that. Coming up Short is both insightful and heartbreaking. The book draws on economics, sociology, demographics, and psychology to explore the decision-making and inner lives of young adults in an American economy where class mobility is limited and risk has been shifted from society to the individual. There are plenty of news articles that treat the various issues Silva examines here without her thoughtful perspective and the strong, well supported arguments she makes. Why is marriage increasing in some demographics but not others? How are young people managing educational debt? How do unstable minimum wage jobs affect economic choices? Why do people often oppose social safety net programs that would help them? All of these are woven into the stories of the young men and women Silva interviewed for her project. Finally Silva makes some thought provoking points about the power of personal narrative, the language of therapy/self improvement and how it shapes young people's mindsets that are essential for anyone working with youth or studying social media to ponder."}, {"userName": "Alix", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43679385-alix", "userReview": "Silva uses interviews to build a compelling argument about the changes to the markers of adulthood for young working class Americans.

As Silva ably demonstrates, for a number of interrelated economic and cultural reasons, they simply cannot become \"adults\" in the traditional sense. To me the only drawbacks of the book were 1) its lack of coherent organization, where the author unnecessarily made the same arguments repeatedly, and 2) its overemphasis on emotional factors in explaining these young adults' struggles. Still, overall a recommended read and good qualitative sociological research."}, {"userName": "Seward Park Branch Library, NYPL", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32904730-seward-park-branch-library-nypl", "userReview": "Jennifer Silva's 'Coming Up Short' is a book that *ought* to have been written\u2014all too often in this country is the subject of income inequality broached from the much more politically safe parlance of the \"Middle Class\", a term certainly more loaded with Americanisms that you can shake a stick at.I think talking about class in America is a little tricky.

Overwhelmingly, they drew boundaries between themselves and \"those who are closest to and just below them in the social structure.\" They take ownership of their successes in overcoming adversity, but this also means that they blame themselves when they don't succeed, instead of acknowledging \"class, race, or gender-based injustice as true obstacles,\" and that they separate themselves from others who fail to overcome the hardships that they overcame. This erodes class solidarity and thereby reinforces the societal structures that keep poor people poor. Neoliberalism reinforces itself.\"'The personal is political' was intended to reveal the profoundly historical and collective nature of experience, not to create a endless array of individual narratives. Yet, without a collective sense of structural inequalities, the suffering and betrayal born of de-industrialization, inequality, and risk is interpreted as individual failure... by dismissing the social forces that work against their attempts to create secure futures and placing responsibility for success only on themselves, this generation of working-class youth will experience coming of age as perpetually coming up short\u2014yet have only themselves to blame.\"I found this hard to read\u2014it's full of citations and footnotes, which I find it so challenging to stay focused through.

All those checkboxes: school, job, house, car, marriage, kids...I feel like I can check only two or three. I feel like I'm behind somehow.\" Sadly, these sentiments are not unique. They are familiar to many guys and girls my age - we so-called \"millenials.\" On the one hand, we are shadowed by our parents' definitions of adulthood, and on the other, we must come to terms with our present-day cultural, social, and financial demands.In Coming Up Short, Jennifer M. Silva tackles questions about what it means to transition to adulthood as a working class young man or woman. Drawing from interviews with 100 young men and women from two former industrial strongholds - Richmond, Virginia and Lowell, Massachusetts - she artfully prods the external and internal forces that influence today's young working class adults. She presents compelling and insightful answers - rendering solidity and coherence to issues usually discussed in abstract terms.Recommended."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth  Higginbotham ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22019321-elizabeth-higginbotham", "userReview": "An amazing book as Silva shared the experiences of young working class people coming of age in this neo-liberal era. As a baby boomer, the study was eye opening in the terrain young people have to navigate with little support. While higher education secured my future, not only does it fail many of the people here, but they go into huge debt. I realize from the outside that young people face a crazy web of service jobs, but Silva really communicates the costs of this rise of service work and the decline in industrial employment. It is good that she tells these stories, since everyone needs to know and I hope her book can encourage young people who are very committed to this individualism to think about collective action to get institutions and business to work for them, rather than just exploit them."}, {"userName": "Daniel Palevski", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5585633-daniel-palevski", "userReview": "100 snippets of real, working class, young adulthood, across the US eastern seaboard during the early 20-teens.Initially, this book reads like an academic research paper (which I guess it is), but the meat of this sociological research project comes out in the stories and confessions of young adults.All of the participants are basically asked the same simple question - what does reaching adulthood mean to you?"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6641268-heather", "userReview": "Actual rating 2.5Out of all the books for class this was most likely the best one.

How does the economic and social instability left in the wake of neoliberalism shape their identities, their understandings of the American Dream, and their futures? Coming Up Short illuminates the transition to adulthood for working-class men and women. Moving away from easy labels such as the \"Peter Pan generation,\" Jennifer Silva reveals the far bleaker picture of how the erosion of traditional markers of adulthood- marriage, a steady job, a house of one's own-has changed what it means to grow up as part of the post-industrial working class. Based on one hundred interviews with working-class people in two towns-Lowell, Massachusetts, and Richmond, Virginia-Silva sheds light on their experience of heightened economic insecurity, deepening inequality, and uncertainty about marriage and family. Silva argues that, for these men and women, coming of age means coming to terms with the absence of choice. As possibilities and hope contract, moving into adulthood has been re-defined as a process of personal struggle-an adult is no longer someone with a small home and a reliable car, but someone who has faced and overcome personal demons to reconstruct a transformed self. Indeed, rather than turn to politics to restore the traditional working class, this generation builds meaning and dignity through the struggle to exorcise the demons of familial abuse, mental health problems, addiction, or betrayal in past relationships. This dramatic and largely unnoticed shift reduces becoming an adult to solitary suffering, self-blame, and an endless seeking for signs of progress. This powerfully written book focuses on those who are most vulnerable-young, working-class people, including African- Americans, women, and single parents-and reveals what, in very real terms, the demise of the social safety net means to their fragile hold on the American Dream.", "title": "Coming Up Short: Working-Class Adulthood in an Age of Uncertainty", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16248551-coming-up-short", "average": 3.9, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1369154213l/16248551.jpg", "reviews": 17, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7521367.Jennifer_M_Silva", "name": "Jennifer M.
