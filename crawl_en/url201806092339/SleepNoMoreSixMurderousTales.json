At the end of each story, I couldn't help but be galled at the twists or miscarriages of justice. They were perfect. Lately, mysteries that focus on what drives an ordinary person to murder, have been of great interest to me. That's what all of these stories, with the exception of one, had in common. It wasn't so much about who the murder(s) was, as to why. In reading this collection, I realize how awesome short story collections can be when you don't want to get bogged down with a novel, or already have a lot of books on your reading plate. Hopefully I can read varying collections in the coming year."}, {"userName": "L.A.

There's something comforting and familiar about them, but they're also laced with humour and just a little bit of cynicism.The Yo-Yo (2006)Now in his seventies, the narrator comes across a yo-yo among some old personal papers. What connects this innocuous object with a crime he witnessed at the age of thirteen? The rest of the story tells us, with plenty of cosy, quintessentially British details which are ultimately ruptured by an act of violence.The Victim (1973)'You know Princess Ilsa Mancelli, of course...' The narrator is the cuckolded first husband of the luminous Ilsa \u2013 except he knew her when she was a small-town girl named Elsie Bowman. They marry when Elsie is just 17, and her affection doesn't last long. When he discovers her deception, the narrator spends a year planning the perfect crime: a lengthy period of psychological torture followed by the untraceable slaughter of Elsie's lover, Collingford. All seems meticulously plotted, but an ingenious ending turns the story on its head and casts doubt on who, exactly, the 'victim' might be.The Murder of Santa Claus (1984)An ensemble cast gives this Christmas-themed tale the feel of a crime classic; a TV adaptation would make perfect festive viewing. The mismatched group \u2013 including 16-year-old Charles Mickledore and his wealthy uncle, an elderly couple and a successful actress \u2013 assemble at a grand house for Christmas celebrations. As the title indicates, it all goes rather horribly wrong. Many years later, Mickledore (now a successful author of crime fiction) writes to the police, finally confessing what he witnessed that night. The pleasure of this lies more in atmosphere than in plot \u2013 I didn't really care whodunnit, but the deliciously camp details (like a damning clue turning up on the Christmas tree) were so enjoyable.The Girl Who Loved Graveyards (1983)'The girl' is taken to live with her aunt and uncle at ten years old after the deaths of her father and grandmother. She's a lonely child, whose happiest moments are spent wandering in a nearby cemetery. But when she overhears an inexplicable conversation about her father between her relatives, what at first seems (to the reader) a fairly obvious conclusion is slowly revealed to be something far more sinister. Worse still, the girl discovers that she has held the key to this secret all along. A tale of the horror that might lurk inside one's own repressed memories, this reminded me of stories by Daphne du Maurier, Shirley Jackson and Muriel Spark.A Very Desirable Residence (1976)A teacher and his colleague are fascinated by the private lives of their headmaster and his much younger, yet remarkably meek and frail, wife. The narrator suspects the headmaster of being abusive, so perhaps it isn't all that surprising when the seemingly docile Emily finally snaps and takes violent revenge on him. In this story, it's the criminal's motive that provides the most surprising twist, and it also adds a rather ironic flavour to the eventual outcome.Mr. Millcroft's Birthday (1992)Lighter and more amusing than most of the rest, this concerns a pair of grasping siblings whose elderly father, now living in a nursing home, makes a startling confession. If the truth comes out, Mildred and Rodney might be cheated of their sizeable inheritance \u2013 so they decide to take matters into their own hands and destroy the evidence... Fun and, again, cleverly ironic.TinyLetter | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Faith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith", "userReview": "I'm not a big fan of short stories but each of these had a delicious and surprising edge to it and I really liked them."}, {"userName": "Ammar", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3569723-ammar", "userReview": "This collection of short stories by the master of crime P.

Some of the methods used and the planning of the murder is extraordinarily clever and was a bit of an eye opener to read about.The stories included a large variety of characters that I had mixed feelings for. Whilst i felt very sorry for the jilted husband in \u201cThe Victim\u201d and the little girl in \u201cThe Girl Who Loved Graveyards\u201d I hated the schoolboy in \u201cThe Yoyo\u201d as i found him very obnoxious and full of himself. I think this character is quite real though as I have encountered a few public school children like this. These being short stories there wasn\u2019t a lot of time for the reader to get to know the characters which i felt was a shame as i would like to have spent a bit more time with some of the characters, discovering more about them and what makes them tick.All the stories appear to be set in the past and have quite a lot of historical detail in them at times that helps the reader imagine the setting for the stories. In one the life of a public school in 1930 is well described and in another the stigma of divorce is mentioned giving the reader a glimpse into the life and problems of the characters. These details were very interesting and helped me to image the characters and story better in my mind.In my personal opinion the stories get betters as the book goes along. I definitely enjoyed the later stories more than the earlier ones. This isn\u2019t to stay that the earlier stories were bad just that the later ones were more my style of story and had a little more going on in them.PD James in the author of many full length novels and short story collections.

Therefore you can imagine my excitement to see that another collection of stories by the inimitable P.D. James has been published. Last year I read and enjoyed \"Mistletoe Murders: and other stories\", this year it is \"Sleep no more\". And yes, there IS a murder in all six stories.The book contains six excellently executed short stories, two of which have a Christmas theme.\"The Yo-Yo\"An elderly man finds a red yo-yo in a box of clutter.\u00a0 This find spurs memories of the events that occurred when, as a child, accompanied by a teacher, he was shipped off from his boarding school to spend Christmas with his widowed grandmother.\"The Victim\"An assistant librarian plans the 'perfect murder' of his celebrity ex-wife's latest husband. This story has a delicious twist at the end - as do many of the stories in this collection.\"The murder of Santa Claus\"A mediocre mystery novelist tells the story of how his uncle, Victor Mickledore, was murdered one Christmas Eve in an atmospheric Cotswold manor house. A retired policeman, Detective Inspector John Pottinger relates his memories of the case.\"Merry Christmas, Mickledore!Go to be and sleep no more.Take this charm and hold it fast;This night's sleep shall be your last.\"P.D. James puts her own spin on the classic 'locked room mystery'.\"The girl who loved graveyards\"An orphaned girl tells of her life living in a house in East London bordering a cemetery. \"She didn't need friends. She had the graveyard and its occupants.\" She lives with her aunt and uncle and has no memory of the first decade of her life. All is revealed when she grows up and returns to the village where she was born...\"A very desirable residence\"The story of an art teacher, and the frame-up of the unpleasant math teacher at his school - whose Georgian house he covets.\"Mr. Millcroft's birthday\"A story that works as a gleeful omen of what can happen when avarice rules your life. It tells of a cunning nursing home resident as he turns the tables on his greedy adult children.Only P.D. James could write these nostalgic, insightful, sinister, and astute mystery stories.\u00a0 She portrays murder 'as a means to an end' - murder done by ordinary people, but told in a way that is distinctly 'unordinary'. They are a fine balance between the succinctness of the short story form coupled with James' famous verbosity. If pressed to pick a favorite story from this collection, I guess it would be \"A very desirable residence\".\u00a0 The irony of the last lines is memorable.A few quotes that I particularly enjoyed from this book:\"The young seldom lie convincingly. They haven't had time to practice like the rest of us.\"\"Memory is always disjointed, episodic.\"\"Marriage is both the most public and the most secret of institutions, its miseries as irritatingly insistent as a hacking cough, its private malaise less easily diagnosed.\"I received this book from\u00a0Knopf/Penguin Random House\u00a0via Edelweiss in consideration of a review."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "A perfect little book of \"six murderous tales\", as it is so aptly sub-titled.

Each story is not a page too long, or short, each ends at precisely the correct time. Such good writing, I really enjoyed the book overall.

She delivers in each short story something other authors fail to deliver in a full-scale novel. All these short murder mystery stories are pithy, get to the crux of the matter and each one is engrossing.Each of these stories are a standalone story, all written in beautiful prose, full of twists, most of which you never see coming. Each story an original from someone who was the queen of mystery writers, who knew how to entertain her readership.PD James may be gone, but this collection is an excellent testament to her talent and writing, and as she always did, reminds me how many women have really made this genre their own.

Even though P.D. James\u2019s writing is often linked to Agatha Christie\u2019s, the stories in this collection are not detective stories or murder mysteries in the most traditional sense. Instead, they more or less read like dark, but humorous observations of the human race, repeatedly questioning what humans are willing to lie and what they're willing to kill for. (Don't worry though, there's always a satisfying resolution to every story.)I feel like the author's dark and clever sense of humour and her knack for unlikable characters can also be compared to the writing style of Roald Dahl and Shirley Jackson, two authors I absolutely love. Even though P.D. James likes to use the same twist (or a slight variation of the same twist) a little too often for my taste, I thoroughly enjoyed my time reading this collection, just as much as I did when reading The Mistletoe Murder this time last year. I can highly recommend both of these collections and will undoubtedly read more of what P.D.

James and appear on the blog tour, I felt that it was an ideal opportunity to acquaint myself with her written works.This is a different sort of review to write for me because I don\u2019t usually review collections of short stories as I normally read full length novels.\u00a0 They do say that a change is as good as a rest, so it was with a certain degree of excitement that I opened the front cover of \u2018Sleep No More\u2019 and when I finished reading the book, my first thought was never has a title been so apt.The characters in the stories were all well thought out and they were believable.\u00a0 In fact you could have plucked them from any town, village and city high street or they could just as easily be your next door neighbour.\u00a0 Each character had their own secrets to hide and skeletons in the closet.\u00a0 It\u2019s almost as if each character has two personas in that they present one persona in public but they have a different persona entirely in private.\u00a0 At times , the characters in this book were rather creepy to say the least.\u00a0 More than once I almost shuddered at how sinister some of the characters actually were.\u00a0 I couldn\u2019t believe how they could commit murder or some other similar crime, not be affected by it and then carry on as normal.\u2018Sleep No More\u2019 is written in a style not dissimilar to the style used by those classic crime writers and speaks of a bygone era.\u00a0 I was hooked on this collection from the moment I opened the front cover and I wasn\u2019t released from the book\u2019s grip until I had closed the back cover.\u00a0 I was so hooked on each and every story that I didn\u2019t realise quite how quickly the pages were turning.\u00a0 It was almost as if they were turning themselves and before I knew it I had finished \u2018Sleep No More\u2019, which I was disappointed about because I was enjoying the author\u2019s writing style so much.\u00a0 Each story comes with a twist, which hits you in the stomach and strikes without warning.\u00a0 On more than one occasion I thought that I had figured out what had happened and to whom, but I soon realised that I was wrong and the author sent me down another path entirely.\u00a0 I genuinely did not see the twists coming.In short I really enjoyed reading \u2018Sleep No More\u2019 and I would recommend it to anybody.\u00a0 This is certainly a book for those fans of classic crime writing.\u00a0 I enjoyed this selection of short stories so much that I have bought the author\u2019s other collection of short stories called \u2018The Mistletoe Murder & Other Stories\u2019.\u00a0 I also now fully intend to go and read all of P.

My top picks from the collection are:- The Murder of Santa Claus: a Cluedo type of murder mystery with all primesuspects narrowed down to the guests and househelp.- The Girl Who Loved Graveyards: this one really gave me the creeps, my favourite.- Mr Millcroft's Birthday: the twist is at the very end and it was cheeky, placing doubt on characters."}, {"userName": "Daniel Kukwa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3885089-daniel-kukwa", "userReview": "Now this is skill: four short stories about murder, from old school Poirot-like settings to a nursing home in the present day.

The final story in this collection of six delivers makes for a hilarious climax."}, {"userName": "Deepa Nirmal", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58651112-deepa-nirmal", "userReview": "P.D. James died in 2014 and yet here are six new murderous tales in 2017. It's a very different experience reading her short stories as opposed to her novels, but even with the abbreviated length she achieves her usual effects. A little bit uneven but still a fun and quick read."}], "description": "No one gets inside the head of the murderer--or makes it a more thrilling read--than the late, great P. D. James. Fast on the heels of her latest best seller: a new, fiendishly entertaining gathering of previously uncollected stories, from the author of Death Comes to Pemberley and The Private Patient.It's not always a question of \"whodunit?\" Sometimes there's more mystery in the why or how. And although we usually know the unhealthy fates of both victim and perpetrator, what of those clever few who plan and carry out the perfect crime? The ones who aren't brought down even though they're found out? And what about those who do the finding out who witness a murder or who identify the murderer but keep the information to themselves? These are some of the mysteries that we follow through those six stories as we are drawn into the thinking, the memories, the emotional machinations, the rationalizations, the dreams and desires behind murderous cause and effect.This selection (c) 2017 by the Estate of P.D.
