Most seem like formulaic regurgitations of more successful series. But once in a blue moon one stumbles on some honest and original stories.This book is a fun and different whodunnit/chase/cyberpunk/city tour, all in one.Kai is a protagonist like no other. You will immerse yourself in this rat's incentives as he gets beat down, kicked around, and knocked about the gritty cyber-slums of the No Go Zone, as he tries to maintain the city's fragile status quo and the memory of its beloved divine celebrity; The Red Light Princess."}, {"userName": "Happy (Mara) Hodges", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7510970-happy-mara-hodges", "userReview": "This story moves at breakneck speed, drawing you into a world where brutality is a fact of daily life. If so much can happen on the one day a year that is supposed to be peaceful, it makes one wonder what an average day in the No Go Zone is like.Kai is definitely not your typical protagonist, and every twist reveals just a little more of his true nature until the shocking truth is presented. As for the princess herself, she inspires intense devotion and reverence not typically given to one of her profession."}, {"userName": "Federico Rosa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39268103-federico-rosa", "userReview": "The Red Light Princess Dizzying, intensely descriptive passages of a dystopic future where the affluent exist on the other side of a barrier to which we have no access to, except by word of mouth, gives way to our mise en scene, a No GO Zone populated by have-nots, hyperbolic talk show hosts, bacterially powered versions of body modification, huge televisual screens that transmit popular mechanized beasts destroying each other in a violent circus maximus. Bodden takes the wise-guy Noir archetype, a down on his luck and ready for some more misfortune nobody, as the anti-hero of this short novel. Kai,street-smart, snarly, cynical, born and bred in the netherworld, is reminiscent of a post modern Phillip Marlowe, part 50's L.A., part Manga action hero, part Harrison Ford in Blade Runner with an Oedipus Complex.Other than an exhilarating,amphetamine fueled pace, there are deeper levels that mirror, whether directly or not, the impoverished, dog-eat-dog world of the ultra-violent ghettoes of Bodden's native Honduras where he has worked, among other things, as a beat reporter covering violent deaths. As much a parable as well as a modern-day cyberpunk yarn, Bodden's violence references video games, youtube, and media obsessions with disasters, the \"less fortunate\" and conflict areas. No less important are religious zealots that would be ready to sacrifice their own limbs in the name of the Red Light Princess, a mysterious deity that is rumored to be the source of much dismay within the No Go Zone. A key scene in the book is where Kai summarily describes tourists that get to view death and poverty first hand, less as a way to change things, and more as a carnival ride, or worse, a modern day version of cultural enrichment. -Federico Rosa"}, {"userName": "Nick Madrid", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45293214-nick-madrid", "userReview": "Red Light Princess was an unexpected delight. The scenery descriptions are rich and engrossing, as well as the the storyline. I enjoyed the revelation of the past through the present chase, something that kept me wanting to turn the page and see what came next in this cyber-punk world of Bodden's imagination."}, {"userName": "Colleen Chen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5964231-colleen-chen", "userReview": "The Red Light Princess takes place in the No Go Zone, a high-density ghetto that has sprung up in the ruins of the old world that lie outside the separation barriers of civilization. The story begins with the narrator, Kai, being chased across the slums of old high-rises, the skywalks above them, up and down and over buildings. Body-modification has developed beyond art to practical usage. Launchers and boosters, talons and weapons fused into muscle and bone allow free-jumps, flight, attack and defense. The ability to sense magnetic fields and metals facilitate tracking for both pursuers and pursuit. Kai\u2019s body modifications are less technologically advanced than those of his pursuers, but he has two advantages: the first is that he\u2019s very good at running away. The second is that it\u2019s the Night of the Clean Hands\u2014a holiday from killing, one night of freedom from the fear of death. Old debts are forgotten on this night, payback is forbidden, and killing is outlawed.Ironically, many people die on this night, both accidentally and on purpose, in the violence of the festival. Still, if anyone breaks the rules and intentionally kills, they are to die in the ring with the Mecha Beasts\u2014cyborg animals who fight, gladiator-style, for the entertainment of viewers. Kai manages to escape his pursuers temporarily, and he witnesses the death of a girl hung from a skywalk. Her murder begins the unfolding of the mythology and the mystery of the Red Light Princess, another girl who died in exactly the same manner as this one, and, as this one, wore a mask, had her hands and tongue cut off, and was covered with tattoos of roses and vines. Something about the original Red Light Princess sparked a devotion and a following\u2014nearly a religion\u2014amongst the people of the No Go Zone, and the imitation of her death has an ominous significance.Because the girl has died in the district of Kai\u2019s gang, he is ordered by his boss to find, before dawn, the person responsible for the death. Tracking the murderer leads him to a brothel where he discovers that the girl is one of three sisters who did a Red Light Princess act. One sister is dead, with two more to go. As Kai continues as both pursuer and pursued, the interconnections between both roles are revealed, along with the reasons for Kai\u2019s personal obsession with the Red Light Princess.This grim, dystopian story is a fascinating read. It takes place on one night, over probably less than a 12-hour period, but is multilayered and intricate in both external plot aspects and as a commentary on aspects of being. The setting itself is like something from a dream\u2014the way the characters free jump across a ruined city seems like it must have been born of an astral experience from the author\u2014and yet it speaks of a vision of a different way of seeing our own world. \u201cCities aren\u2019t just systems that control the way we move through space. They can be much more\u2014free spaces that elude the formal structures of control.\u201dKai is a flawed non-hero who represents an Everyman inside all of us\u2014the disconnected, insecure part of us who has lost touch with all meaning aside from that animal spark inside us that desires life. He is an addict. He has an inferiority complex, constantly comparing himself to a dead brother whom he imitates whenever he wants to hide his own weakness. He wants his luck to change and will enter all sorts of games of chance, all the while knowing he cannot expand beyond his universe of ill luck and mistrust. He has never wanted more than his life here, never wondered what lay beyond the No Go Zone. He\u2019s like a hamster on a wheel and knows it, but hasn\u2019t the lucidity to desire anything different.The disfigured Red Light Princess, her death, and her near deification offers a troubling metaphor, perhaps, for what the masses will cling to when they feel they have nothing else. I didn\u2019t quite understand what she could mean, but that might be because I was too busy trying not to vomit whenever I read descriptions of her. Because yes, The Red Light Princess is highly graphic and often disturbing. It is not a comfortable read. The plot is somewhat dizzying and sometimes got too surreal for me to understand. Still, the writing is effective, powerful, and rarely gets in the way of what it\u2019s expressing. It\u2019s hard to stop reading it even though one knows it\u2019s probably not going to be a happy ending. It\u2019s a story that will challenge its readers, whether they enjoy it or not, and its images will remain in their consciousness long after the read is done."}, {"userName": "Catherine Griffin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35808103-catherine-griffin", "userReview": "A young man pursues a murderer across a dystopian slum city, but he can\u2019t escape his own past.The setting is the star in this book, which explores a future slum city \u2013 over-crowded, chaotic and violent. The tone is unrelievedly dark, but the lead character Kai was engaging enough to keep my interest. He\u2019s a young gang member on a mission to bring a murderer to what passes for justice round here, but his own past misdeeds are catching up with him.The book has been formatted with a teeny font, which is hard work to read. However, the writing is good throughout, with few editing errors. I wasn\u2019t keen on the use of present tense but YMMV.Expect sexual references, lots of violence, blood and death."}, {"userName": "Kari", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11658873-kari", "userReview": "I fell so in love with the princess that I wanted to meet her.
