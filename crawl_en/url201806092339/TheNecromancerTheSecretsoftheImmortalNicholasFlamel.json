I praised the first book for it's originality, enjoyed the second book, and struggled through the third book. I barely made it through The Necromancer. The pace isn't quite as break neck as the previous novels, but there is still plenty of chase scenes. I really think the alternate points of view do not help this series. I really don't want to read about the bad guys having mundane conversations and plotting things. Nothing of import is really happening with the secondary characters and I found myself skipping around hoping there would be a point. Unfortunately, there is no point. Nothing is resolved, nothing is progressed. If there weren't multiple points of view then this book would have been about 100 pages. If all of the unimportant details were taken out it would have been even shorter. The main plot is very slim and is padded with different characters. I used to respect the bad guys, now they just seem like cardboard cutouts that say \"MUAHAHA\" when you push a button. None of the characters have really progressed, and I won't be continuing this series. Each book is the same: run from something, bad guy conversation, go get new powers, side character interlude, run from something, the end. Action is not enough to make an interesting novel."}, {"userName": "Franco  Santos", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29931457-franco-santos", "userReview": "Otro gran libro de esta saga que se pone cada vez mejor y m\u00e1s oscura.

What started out as a powerful force with a clear heading and characters that were often connected, has now plummeted downward to an end of some sort, but throughout the journey, the flow is fragmented and broken apart, sometimes rejoining, but a lot of it turning to mist, with no hope of congealing again.It's really a shame that the series had so much potential with the first few books; blending mythology, action, and historical fiction, but it has now become a mess of too many characters and not enough focus or interaction. I'm a huge fan of large, overarching plots and authors having the courage to switch focus and point of view from character to character, but Necromancer is the perfect example of what NOT to do. The first half of the book seems to be only a collection of incredibly short, fragmented chapters that introduce little information, provide little opportunity for any character development or interaction, and leave the reader wanting much more - principally a re-focused and reinvigorated plot. Furthermore, Scott continues to put the reader at odds with the rest of the series, continually having the protagonists told that they have been lied to and are not to believe anyone but each other. The point is made so bluntly that character interactions from previous entries in the series are now questionable at best.It's not that Scott has too many characters than a novel can feasibly support, but he doesn't provide enough time for each of the character personalities to percolate. Josh and Sophie seem more like side characters now, Nicholas Flamel barely has any lines in the novel, (sure, he's dying, but he is the series namesake), and the only consistently interesting characters in the series are shaping up to be Dr. John Dee and Machiavelli, with Machiavelli's interest waning. Redeeming the book were the few brief memory segments between the Witch of Endor and Prometheus, (who reminds me completely of Destruction from Neil Gaiman's Sandman series), as well as the final fifth (sixth, maybe?) of the novel. Other than that, there was just too much transition and not enough interaction.I wonder... with only two books left in the series, will there be a resurgence of Dagon's character? Saint-Germain's scheduled concerts? Niflheim as a destroyed Shadowrealm? The Morrigan/Bastet as major players?"}, {"userName": "Cherie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6460330-cherie", "userReview": "I don't know what's wrong with the rest of the people, but I think this series is great!!!

And yes, it is that good. I will go so far as to say it is the best of the lot.Up front, let me say that I loved this series right from the beginning though I have also shared some other reviewers frustrations with the year-long delays between books. Book 4 is astonishing. There have been hints throughout the series that Michael Scott was building an entire world and here we begin to see it all come together. I think it is also clear that he is writing one huge novel, broken into six \"chapters.\"The Necromancer is filled with backstory to most of the major characters, especially my favorite, Dee. He has a new sidekick, who is quite wonderful, and the developing relationship between Machiavelli and Billy is touching and funny. Many of the hints and clues in the previous books pay off and there is much more fantasy in this book than in the others, with entire scenes set in Shadowrealms. The ending is breathtaking.As with the other books in this series, language and tone is entirely appropriate to the audience.Highly recommended. I think I will have to up my stock order this morning and order more of the previous three.TV"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2433251-sara", "userReview": "after the all 5 stars in this series, I'm kinda disappointed with this book.first, I love the new character, Aoife the Shadow. she was so much alike with Sophie. well, the blurting-everything-in-my-head Sophie maybe.unlike Scathach who was very mysterious, Aoife was more open up to others. at least, from what she seemed.she always said she didn't afraid of anything but I didn't think so. for some thing, I think she sounded scared but tried to convince herself that she wasn't scared.plus, she was brave. she did what it takes to help Sophie and that was so kind of her even maybe she felt the same way as Sophie of losing her twin.the weird thing is, Aoife said they were ten thousand years old and born after Danu Talis fell. but, Hekate was ten thousand years old. how could they had the same age? Hekate saw Abraham wrote Codex and that was before Danu Talis fell.second, I'm getting tired of Perenelle Flamel. the thing is, why did she have to say something like that to Josh? was it because Josh was untrusting anybody or because he wasn't as strong as her sister? either way, that is wrong. I'm a teenager myself, and if someone said something like that, comparing you with your sibling, well... the first thing on my mind was to smack their face.sure, maybe she knew what she was doing or that she made a plan or what, whatever. sure, she was more powerful than her husband, but for something, she was no different from Dee or Machiavelli. she was like Dee but work behind the scene like Machiavelli. something like that.third, Virginia Dare! new character! I like her witty character thought. maybe she was chatty, talked a lot. but she was refreshing in such a dark story like this book.fourth, relationship of Zephaniah, Prometheus and Mars, was very interesting. even The Elders have a relationship like human huh?Prometheus seemed like a father to me. kind, and everything.Zephaniah in the old days seemed A LOT like Sophie. well, Zephaniah and Prometheus were like Sophie and Josh.fifth, Prometheus was the one who made human. so who was Abraham The Magus? He wasn't human of course which is weird, come to think of what Hekate said.I always thought he was human since he could touch Codex which couldn't touched by The Elders. but maybe it was just because he was the one who made it right? haha...sixth, I read the first chapter of \nWarlock\n -I'm dying to read it!- and Zephaniah told Mars that he was tricked by Dee. Josh was at his possession when he went to Dee. would he released Josh then? and what would Josh do? he liked Dee more than Flamels. I think he would still follow Dee even after he got his body back. but the thing of leaving Sophie behind is still on my mind.I don't think he would leave Sophie. I mean he was always the one who thought a lot about 'Trust Only Each Other'. but Mars told Josh his sons were fighting each other then die. I'm afraid Sophie and Josh would be like that.by the way, Remus and Romulus were Mars sons right? weren't one of them was Scathach and Aoife father?Scathach and Aoife were vampire, so that means one of them was a vampire? but when I saw Wikipedia (yeah right, I love Aunt Wikipedia) I saw the symbol of wolf. I'm confused!!!maybe it would be better if I didn't guess that much.but I didn't against the idea of Josh would being with Dee. it would be good story if Josh was something like spying Dee. he was at Dee's hand but Mars had possession on him and Zephaniah at Sophie. if they were could made some link each other, it would be cool story.that's just my idea okay?so, I can't wait \nThe Warlock\n to come and to be honest, I read the first chapter like thousand times! yeah, I really am sick.\nThe Alchemyst\n : Nicholas Flamel.\nThe Magician\n : either Dee or Machiavelli.\nThe Sorceress\n : Perenelle Flamel of course.\nThe Necromancer\n : still either Dee or Machiavelli.\nThe Warlock\n : Mars or like my friend said, both \nThe Warlock\n and \nThe Enchantress\n is about the twins. so maybe this is about Josh. (Sophie as the \nWarlock\n? come on!)\nThe Enchantress\n : Zephaniah or Sophie.after I think more, Zephaniah and Mars as the title of the books seemed ridiculous. I mean they were Elders, not human. so maybe Josh and Sophie were more fit.wait, I'm forget about Virginia Dare!"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5841469-andrea", "userReview": "I literally love everything about this series except for Josh.

I hate ninjas-they have no honor.\u201dI think it's clear now that these books aren't a series. They're actually one big-ass book cut into six books. The novellas are apart from the main storyline. So it's basically two novellas and one book of 2.670 pages!! But I see the point where people think, nuh uh that's way too big a book for me to read.... When you have series like Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter containing 25 books and counting.In this book the big excitement starts. We see three storylines somehow merging into one another. There is the story in San Francisco, on Alcatraz and in London. All of these are essential in the end and I love them!!It's amazing what Michael Scott did to think of his characters. Even the smaller roles are big names. Think of Billy the Kid, Shakespeare and so on. This review is maybe a bit hard for me as I've read this in February and writing it just now [whoops, wasn't doing my blog back then]... I will definitely re-read this book and the entire series. I love it and can't imagine a day where I will stop loving these books!!This book is the part where shit goes down for Josh and Sophie. They're relationship as twins is tested to the core. More and more characters are presented into the story. We get more background from a couple of characters and a lot of action!!The best part about this series is the fast pace. If you think the real-time in the story is only a week... in four books!! I love it, it gives us much action and keeps us excited and hooked to the story..|Blog|Twitter|Facebook|Bloglovin\u2019|Instagram|Tumblr|Google+|Pinterest|Niume|"}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3230842-mike", "userReview": "My congratulations go out to Michael Scott for another well written book in the series. I just have one request Mr. Scott. Please please don't go J.K. on us and call a wet fart the ending. Ok. On to this great book. I won't give details because I really want everyone to give this one a read. The story picked right back up and was action packed from the start. One of the things I liked most was all the background and character developement in this book. We got more info about Scatty and the Witch of Endor. And learned how much of a trunk muffin Dr. Dee really is. Plus we get a little more info on the ass clowns that are trying to destroy the human race. One thing i liked was how in this book when Josh gets the truth about the origin of mankind he wasn't just like \"oh, well.... uh... ok i accept that.\" Nope. He was f'd up and had a hard time wrapping his brain around it. I would've slapped someone and had to use the bathroom.

Sama seperti sebelumnya juga, jika ada musuh yang baru maka akan ada peran protagonis yang baru. Hanya saja menurut saya perpindahan tokoh ditiap bab jaraknya kadang terlalu lama sehingga \"rasa\" kejutannya mulai hilang. Adegan pertempurannya pun juga tidak terlalu seru. Saya akan menulisnya kejadian yang dialami tiap tokoh.Nicholas dan Flamel kembali ke toko buku mereka Small Book Shop yang sudah porak poranda, mengambil senjata rahasia mereka yang tertinggal. Sedangkan Josh dan Sophie kembali ke rumah bibi Agnes, di sana mereka bertemu dengan Aoife sang bayangan, saudara kembar Scathach dan laki-laki Jepang bernama Niten, si Ahli Pedang, dikenal juga sebagai Miyamoto Musashi. Sophie \"diculik\" oleh Aoife dan Niten, sehingga Josh terpaksa meminta bantuan pasangan Flamel. Dengan mudah mereka mengetahui lokasi keberadaan Sophie, Aoife hanya ingin berbincang-bincang dengan Sophie tanpa ada gangguan, walau hubungannya dengan saudara kembarnya tidak akur, dia dapat merasakan kalau ada bahaya yang mengancam Scatty dan dia merasa kalau kembarannya \"pergi\". Oh ya, mereka juga menemui Prometheus, untuk membangkitkan sihir Api milik Josh. Dr. John Dee nasipnya terancam karena telah gagal menjalankan tugas dari para Tetua, dia menjadi buronan, sudah diadili, dia pun mengarungi Xibalba untuk melarikan diri, yang biasa dikenal dengan Persimpangan, Sarang rasa takut, salah satu Alam bayangan kuno, daerah netral yang digunakan saat para Tetua dan tetua Gelap dari berbagai Alam Bayangan perlu mengadakan pertemuan. Dee juga dikejar oleh para Cucubuth (sangat langka, keturunan vampire dan Torc Madra, tentara bayaran, pemburu, peminum darah) dan dua burung gagak raksasa, Huginn dan Muninn. Mereka tak hidup dan tak mati, berada diantaranya, kedua burung itu adalah makhluk abadi yang bisa bicara seperti manusia, diciptakan oleh Dewi Berwajah Tiga Hekate, sebagai hadiah bagi Tetua bermata satu Odin. Yub, Odin ingin balas dendam karena Dee telah membunuh Hekate. Pengejaran mereka untuk menangkap Dee tidaklah mudah karena dia mendapat sekutu, wanita dengan seruling mautnya, Virginia Dare.Joan of Arc dan Schtach masih terjebak di zaman Pleistosen, melawan makhluk-makhluk buas dengan kekuatan yang tersisa. Saint-Germain pun meminta bantuan temannya, Ksatria Saracen atau Palamedes menemui Tetuanya agar bisa membawanya kembali pada istri tercintanya. Bersama Shakespeare, mereka pergi ke Hutan Sherwood untuk menemui Mater Tammuz, si Manusia Hijau, untuk mengirim ke masa lalu. Tapi, sang Tetua tidak bisa membawa mereka kembali, hanya bisa mengantarkan, hanya Cronos, sang Penguasa Waktu yang bisa membawa mereka kembali. Dan ketika mereka sampai ke masa lalu, Sait-Germain tidak hanya bertemu dengan Joan dan Scatty saja, dia bertemu dengan orang yang sudah mengajarinya mencuri sihir Api milik Prometheus dan yang mengajari Sang Alchemist menerjemahkan Codex, Lelaki bertudung yang mempunyai nama Marethyu, yang berarti kematian. Marethyu membawa mereka mengarungi dunia lain lagi, Danu Talis.Nasip Marchiavellie dan Billy the Kid lebih mujur daripada Dee, walau gagal membunuh Perenelle, mereka ditugaskan untuk membangkitkan monster-monster yang terkurung di Alcatraz. Billy the Kid meminta bantuan temannya Ma-ka-tai-me-she-kia-kiak atau panggilan mudahnya adalah Elang Hitam. Elang Hitam membawa mereka pada seorang Tetua, Quetzalcoatl sang Ular Berbulu atau Kukulkan (saya sering sekali salah menyebutnya dengan kalkunkan :P) untuk membangkitkan monster tersebut. Ada perkataan Marchiavellie yang saya suka, begini bunyinya ketika Billy bertanya pada Marchiavelli:\"Apakah kau pernah terpikir untuk membunuh majikanmu?\"\"Tidak pernah\" jawab Marchiavelli.\"Mengapa tidak?\" tanya Billy.\"Siapa tahu akan datang suatu hari saat aku menginginkan keabadianku dicabut, satu hari saat aku ingin menua dan mati.\"Satu hal yang saya dapat dari buku ini adalah, bahwa keabadian itu tidak melulu menyenangkan.read more: http://www.kubikelromance.com/2012/02...@peri_hutan"}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3927155-caroline", "userReview": "I think it is possible to divide this series between the first three books and this one (and most probably the two others which will follow: The Warlock (2011) and The Enchantress (2012)). This book takes a whole new tone and you get from the beginning that things really are serious and that a war or at the very least a conflict is imminent. The three first books were about Awakening the Twins and teaching them some magic, as well as fleeing from John Dee and Niccolo Machiavelli. The Necromancer is a much darker book and shows also the most terrible secrets of the planet.The twins go back to San Francisco and don't know what to do from there on. They know they have a responsability, being the Twins of Legend. But they are unsure what to do and who to trust. They don't want to trust people blindly.Each book brings a wave of new characters. In The Necromancer, various new characters appear and Prometheus is the most incredible one, he is the Witch of Endor's (who gave her memories to Sophie) brother and Scathach's uncle. Through Sophie's eyes we learn a lot about him and his past, but also what is going on with the Elders. The character of Virginia Dare is also very interesting: independant and cunning. You will also learn a lot about Scathach through her (wait for it) twin sister Aoife!I particularly liked reading the changes in the personalities of both John Dee and Niccolo Machiavelli. I feel that their true natures are reflected through their actions in The Necromancer. They are clearly different and \"not in the same league\". Machiavelli seems to decide on cold calculation whereas John Dee's decisions seem mostly motivated by fear. (Coward.)No matter how well described the \"good\" characters are, you can really judge the quality of a story on its \"bad guys\". Creating flawless and moral characters is less complicated (though not simple either!) than creating a credible \"evil\" counterpart. In The Secrets of The Immortal Nicholas Flamel series, there isn't a clear distinction between good and bad. I mean, there is a distinction, but what is pointed out is that the characters aren't described as good or bad but as characters all utterly convinced of the rightness of what they are doing. No one doubts Nicholas and Perenelle Flamel are on \"the good side\", but The Necromancer challenges that conviction, as well as it challenges it for other characters. All the characters working for the Dark Elders all have very profound reasons to do so, but they vary depending on the characters. I cannot stress enough my complete admiration for Michael Scott and the incredible story he created intertwining fiction with historical facts and legends. The only characters who do not exist are Josh and Sophie! All the others are so interesting that I went to check their biographies/stories on internet, and I can't wait to read more about them. The characterisation is for me one of the strongest point of this series, after the plot and story-telling!The ending will keep you at the edge of your seat: wow! I can't say anything, but you will clearly be quite impatient for Summer 2011 and the release of The Warlock!This book finally gets at the turning point of the story where a conflict seems inevitable and the characters have to choose sides. The Necromancer is a very strong and heart-breaking book that will surprise you, frighten you and make you long for The Warlock."}, {"userName": "Fran", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1853166-fran", "userReview": "Oke, novel ini sukses membawa saya tidak berhenti membaca hingga menyentuh halaman akhir dan tentu saja sukses membuat histeris dan tidak sabar menunggu buku berikutnyaNecromancer, sesuai judulnya di sini John Dee mendapat giliran untuk tampil dengan porsi terbanyak.

Like the Percy Jackson books from Rick Riordan, it is filled with characters from myth and history, mixing lots of different worlds with the story of 2 (not-so-)normal American teens, in this case twins Josh and Sophie Newman. In my opinion, it is much better written than the Riordan, and the story is much more complex and satisfying.This fourth volume is more scattered than previous ones, with multiple story lines diverging from the main one of Josh and Sophie, and focusing on characters introduced in prior volumes. Ultimately, there will be six books in this story arc, and the storylines will again converge.

I really like to the setting of the many places they travel too. I can\u2019t believe Josh and Sophie chose their sides. The summoning at the end was super stressful but very well written. I felt like I was in the room and could see it happening.

And they're both more confused than ever about their future. Neither of them has mastered the magics they'll need to protect themselves, they've lost Scatty, and they're still being pursued by Dr. John Dee. Most disturbing of all, however, is that now they must ask themselves, can they trust Nicholas Flamel? Can they trust anyone?Alcatraz:Dr. Dee underestimated Perenelle Flamel's power. Alcatraz could not hold her, Nereus was no match for her, and she was able to align herself with the most unlikely of allies. But she wasn't the only one being held on the island. Behind the prison's bars and protective sigils were a menagerie of monsters, and now Machiavelli has come to Alcatraz to loose them on San Francisco.Perenelle might be powerful, but each day she weakens, and even with Nicholas back at her side, a battle of this size could be too much for her. Nicholas and Perenelle must fight to protect the city, but the effort will probably kill them both.London:Having been unable to regain the two final pages of the Codex, Dee has failed his Elder and is now an outlaw.But the Magician has a plan. With the Codex and the creatures on Alcatraz, he can control the world. All he needs is the help of the Archons. But for his plan to work, he must raise the Mother of the Gods from the dead. For that, he'll have to train a necromancer.", "title": "The Necromancer\n      \n          (The Secrets of the Immortal Nicholas Flamel #4)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6693332-the-necromancer", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320460606l/6693332.jpg", "reviews": 1758, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/27100.Michael_Scott", "name": "Michael Scott"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Young Adult", "Fantasy", "Fiction", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6693332-the-necromancer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10712962-el-nigromante", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7949361-the-necromancer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9087239-the-necromancer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9983532-the-necromancer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8236019-the-necromancer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6716668-the-necromancer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18214369", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2402971.The_Magician", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4588949-the-sorceress", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17402605-the-alchemyst", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8458018-the-warlock", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8519822-the-enchantress", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
