Or really goes somewhere, at all. It's about a guy who doesn't really manage to get anywhere at speed (unless maybe you're talking about the drug in which case he might have some experience with it), who is in his mid-thirties and hasn't really done anything to his life, who is a great dad to his kid on the Sundays he gets to see her. An ordinary sort of guy, kinda useless, who just happens to see ghosts. (Not a spoiler. It's even on the dust jacket.)Where the read that swept me away yesterday was an ideas book, this is much more a people book. I love this deadbeat idiot Will. I want to jump into the book and fix his life for him, but I love him anyway, because he loves his daughter and his family and his ex-wife, and he does the best he can with the hand he's been dealt, even though he's occasionally daft enough to ignore the good cards in his hand or throw them away in some silly move. I love his daughter, who is an ordinary twelve year old girl who loves and hates her parents, and whose biggest thing to ask of her dad is 'Don't Screw Up' (capital letters included). I loved his ex-wife, who was not a Madonna or a whore in the equation, but a woman who screwed up sometimes like anybody else.If you're looking for a book that takes you on a ride, don't bother. Will can't even drive. It's the bus or your own two feet all the way. It's not even good if you want something supernatural and creepy, because Will and his family are so damn ordinary. But there's some amazing writing in here, the last page is gorgeous, and if you like Will, it'll make you smile and maybe release a bit of tension from your chest, because maybe he's gonna be okay.I really, really enjoyed it. I read it in one sitting -- okay, no, that's a lie: I read it in three sittings. The first one on the floor until my ass went numb, the second one until my dad came and poked me to come and see if I wanted him to buy me a new hoodie, and the third until I'd finished it. I did do a bit of emergency Anglo-Saxon translation for someone in which I managed to translate every word but the verbs*, but that was forty minutes ago and I swear I only just settled down to read a couple of minutes ago...(In case you're wondering about the length of the sittings, I can stand having a numb backside for a long time. I come from a distinguished line of people who can fall asleep on the back of a motorbike while riding pillion: uncomfortable is not a word I'm very familiar with. But other than that helpful hint, I can't tell you. What I'm trying to say is, this is the kind of book that for me meant putting it down involved some kind of effort. I can't promise you'll like it, mind.)You'll notice I haven't said much about the ghosts. They have their part to play, but it's much more about a guy who sometimes sees ghosts than about A Guy Who Sees Ghosts.*I keep wanting to go on tangents, which I think I somewhat blame on the style of this book. The style of a book always gets into my head. So anyway, here is just one of them: it's the 'because' and 'therefore's that stick with you from a language: I can still 'parce que...' with the best of them but damned if I can remember the complicated conversations drilled into me about nuclear power vs windfarms in my French classes. Fortunately, Anglo-Saxon doesn't involve words for nuclear power or windfarms, but I still couldn't figure out what God was supposed to be doing in that sentence. Although it doesn't help that my Norse vocabulary is more recent, and both similar and different enough to get in my way."}, {"userName": "J.K.

Re-reading August 2013.Still just as awesome as I remembered.*****Will \"Dead\" Kennedy (also known as DK) sees dead people. I know this is starting to sound like a cliche, what with \"The Sixth Sense\" and Dean Koontz's popular \"Odd Thomas\" trilogy, but Stewart surpasses both of these with this moving, funny, and creepy book. DK's a former Texas punk, still in love with his ex-wife, and very much involved with his twelve-year-old daughter, Megan. In some ways his life is shaped by the dead -- he can't drive a car, for example, because he's gotten in too many accidents braking for ghosts -- but the real haunting is in the form of a past he can't let go. When a cousin of sorts calls DK up because there's a ghost crying in his garage, DK opens up a can of worms in the ghostly world and in his own life.I started this book yesterday morning, and finished it last night. It's impossible to put down, and it's got one hell of a soundtrack. DK's the kind of protagonist who you root for, want to slap around, and kind of want to dive between the covers of the book to save.

He also sees dead people on a regular basis, and is dealing with some murderous relatives. Although it does have some genuinely creepy parts, the story is more about how a man deals with his erratic family life, his strained relations with his daughter, and his inability to just cope with life as a grown-up, than about horrific situations (i.e. less Odd Thomas by Dean Koontz and more along the lines of a Faulkner short story with some Douglas Coupland thrown in). The writing is very descriptive and sets each scene beautifully, although it sometimes got in the way of the action (I caught myself scanning a few of the more detailed paragraphs a few times since they didn't seem to be going anywhere). And although some characters made terrible choices again and again to the point where you just wanted to shake them, they were all realistically portrayed and fairly sympathetic. The final scene of the book was especially poignant and left the story exactly where it should be. If you're looking for a horror story, it's not going to satisfy you. If you're looking for a story about a man who hits bottom and somehow finds a way to redeem himself (in a bitingly sarcastic, anti-sentimental way) to a bizarre cast of characters, it's a great read."}, {"userName": "Garlan \u270c", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1979703-garlan", "userReview": "This was a quirky, enjoyable read that just didn't quite live up to its promise.

When a distant cousin asks for his help in exorcising a ghost, DK finds himself in over his head. A dead uncle keeps preaching to him, and another dead cousin seems to be warning him against something.

La manera en que el autor lo enlaza con su familia es soberbia y forma una relaci\u00f3n compleja y muy interesante entre ellos.

I mean, he's got a reason, and it's an awesome reason.There was just some bit of magic missing to get the good details, the personality, voice, writing, plot--to plaster all these things together into a great book. What's sad is, it's better than three stars, but because it has this great potential, the fact that it lacks some undefinable spark of magic to make it so makes it feel like it falls shorter than it does.

I used to read Spot the Frog, a charming comic strip about a frog living with an older gentleman. I recently heard that the strip was ending, and discovered that the author had a blog. In the blog, I found that this writer was a fan of Joe Lansdale, among other writers I like, and along the way I read his review of a book by Sean Stewart about a haunted man who could see the dead. It sounded like my thing, so I found it at the library.On the cover of the book, Neal Stephenson gushes, \u201cStephen King meets Ibsen. Trust me,\u201d and that\u2019s about the scope of it. It\u2019s a literate horror novel, with some delicious imagery and emotion. Just as you start to think that this is a character-driven novel of personal struggle, the author throws in a couple of plot elements to keep you hooked. But he\u2019ll still keep you guessing, as the end of the main plot ends about 40 pages before the end of the book. There\u2019s a lot in the book to keep you interested, and to keep you reading.The book is about William Kennedy, a man who has been able to see ghosts since he was about eight years old. He knows they are ghosts, because they are always black-and-white, even when everything around them is in color. They get to the real world through the use of \u201cghost roads,\u201d which are gray alleyways, sidewalks, or corridors that they walk down. The roads are their connections back to the living, and each ghost is connected for one reason or another. Maybe it\u2019s revenge; maybe it\u2019s because they have something to tell a loved one; maybe they just don\u2019t realize yet that they are dead. When Will tries to help his cousin with one of his ghosts, he finds something dark and dangerous, and then when his cousin dies as a result, Will goes from being the man who sees ghosts to a man who is haunted by one of those ghosts.The imagery of the ghost roads is amazing to me, and when the author gets down to describing Will\u2019s own journey down one of these roads, you will find yourself entranced. The author writes in a crisp, lean style, and he manages to bring the world of the dead to life with a minimal amount of words. The book is only 243 pages long, but you will find yourself thinking that the book has to be longer. There\u2019s so much packed into this brief novel that you may find yourself drowning in the narrative without realizing you were even submerged. And what you\u2019ll find as you read the novel is that Will is haunted, but not because he sees ghosts.This is an extraordinary novel, and not the sort of thing you would expect if you go into it thinking that it\u2019s going to be a horror novel. It\u2019s deeper and more resonant than that type of genre fiction, and you will find yourself thinking of it long after you\u2019ve finished it. In Ibsen, you find a lot of idolizing of man\u2019s struggle against himself; in Perfect Circle, you\u2019ll find the same thing, and this is what makes the novel work so well."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123482-john", "userReview": "[The plot line is: 1.

And to be honest, I still couldn`t make the connection after reading this,except for the mentions of the sparks in the couple of pages near the endings.The only thing the author did right however was writing the book, with enough punchiness in it that it kept you hooked to reading. The plot was awesome especially regarding the MC and his daughter. Their moments were sweet. Everything seems to be mixing up at first, with no clues about how the MC would clean up his mess (debts,killer ghost, gun wound,first crush,etc) but its just amazing how things started to tie up their loose end. Which is a relief, considering how he really tried to be a good father and redeemed himself as a person.The author also did a great job in setting up the piece, creating spooked enough atmosphere but without withdrawing the funny parts of this.

The characters were well thought out and the use of his own childhood memories interlaced with what was happening in the present, managed to give Will and the other characters depth and knowledge.

Not in the remotest way something I'd be able to write, which makes it quite comfortable to read (I do read as a writer in some ways).William 'Dead' Kennedy can see and talk to ghosts. In fact, he seems to be better at understanding ghosts than he does with live people, like his ex-wife and his daughter. While the seeing dead people trope has been heavily worked in the last while, the working-poor characters and setting take it to unexpected places. I have a personal loathing for books where poor people end up losing everything or are portrayed as hopeless aimless losers in the name of 'realism' (The Pearl, by Steinbeck is the former, but that's another rant entirely). Firecracker's characters may be poor, and may make bad decisions, but they're not fools and they're not pitiable. And it starts with a ghost and an explosion--you can't go wrong with that."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/961136-becky", "userReview": "Early on in the book, this engaging read promises chills and thrills via a truly creepy encounter with a young female ghost, but Perfect Circle turns out to be not so much a \"ghost story\" as a story about a broken man -- indeed, a man who's always been at least a little bit broken -- learning to pick up the pieces and create a life for himself.Dryly funny, full of East-Texas local color, and ringing true about how it feels to be down so long you don't know how to get up, Perfect Circle was so enjoyable I read it in one sitting. It's not perfect -- I felt the ghost of cousin Tom was not as menacing as he was meant to seem, and I don't feel the book's title is particularly resonant (though Stewart tries hard via tie-ins with the REM song, the CDs the protagonist breaks, and the shape of cousin AJ's glasses) -- but it's definitely worth a read, and a reread.This was the first book of Stewart's that I've read, and I'm interested to check out more."}, {"userName": "Ruth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6154243-ruth", "userReview": "As a native Houstonian, I found his depiction of H-Town to be weird. So I looked him up- born in Lubbock, he moved to Canada when he was 3 and stayed there through college. Apparently he did live in Houston for a period as an adult, but not enough to be able to accurately depict the city. He currently lives in Davis, CA.As a punk rock fan, I found his selection of punk bands to be\u2026 sad. Mainstream. Sex Pistols, meh, okay I guess it\u2019s requisite. REM, really? Constant name-dropping of crappy to mediocre bands is sad.The story was okay, but it seems to me that he should write about things he actually knows when we\u2019re talking character nuance or at the least not try to depict the nuance to such a large degree."}, {"userName": "Ketan Shah", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6015137-ketan-shah", "userReview": "A simply written yet evocative story of a man who can see ghosts.

Digamos que es un 4 con cierta tendencia al 3 1/2, pues por m\u00e1s que tenga ciertas reminiscencias a \"Cuernos\", en su mezcla de lo conmovedor o sentimental con el elemento fant\u00e1stico, cierto es que no llega a la altura de la novela de Joe Hill, a lo mejor porque le falta grandeza en ciertos aspectos.No obstante, se trata de una lectura muy recomendable, especialmente para amantes del g\u00e9nero de fantasmas, que en \u00faltima instancia no es sino sobre una reflexi\u00f3n sobre la vida, el crecimiento y la capacidad de redenci\u00f3n."}, {"userName": "Pat Neuman", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7366389-pat-neuman", "userReview": "I loved this book. I loved the authenticity of the voices of all of the characters and the concise and apt portrayal of the extended family.

In an interview the author said that this was his take on the movie Sixth Sense.This book is much more than that. Its about.

What I will say is that I know a lot of Will Kennedys, and Sean Stewart creates in this character the most likeable, saddening, real YET hopeful figure I have encountered in months of my reading. The relationship between Will and Megan is heartrending. That between Will and AJ is chilling (hey, this is a 'ghost story').

He's haunted by family, by dead people with unfinished business, and by those perfect pop songs that you can't get out of your head. He's a 32-year-old Texan still in love with his ex-wife. He just lost his job at Pet-Co for eating cat food. His air-conditioning is broken, there's no good music on the radio, and he's been dreaming about ghost roads. When Will's cousin (\"\"My dad married your Aunt Dot's half-sister\"\") calls in the middle of the night about a dead girl haunting his garage, it seems like an easy way to make a thousand dollars. But nothing is ever that simple, especially when family is involved. Will's mother is planning a family reunion of epic proportions. Will's ex-wife is married to a former Marine. His twelve-year-old daughter Megan thinks Will needs someone to look after him.
