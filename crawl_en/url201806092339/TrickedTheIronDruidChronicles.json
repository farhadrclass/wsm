This wasn\u2019t what I expected at all. I was tempted to give Tricked only three stars, but then I decided against it because Hearne\u2019s writing and research deserve some reward after all. That said, me counting pages to the end is never a good sign, and I caught myself doing it more than once. I didn\u2019t mind the extensive worldbuilding and the occasional mythology lessons in the first two books, quite the contrary. I got a little tired of it in book three, but I was tempted to skip entire passages in book four. And yet I didn\u2019t because I was determined to carefully read every single word so that I can be sure the problem is him, not my lack of attention. And guess what? It\u2019s him. There was simply not enough to connect the huge infodumps in this book, especially in the first part. While I\u2019m always up for a challenge and I\u2019m more likely to enjoy a book that actually teaches me something new, it still bothers me when parts of it read more like a textbook than like an actual novel. With a group of Norse gods hot on his heels, everyone\u2019s favorite Druid Atticus Sullivan must come up with a solution that will keep him, his hound Oberon and his apprentice Granuaile safe. Fortunately for them all, he\u2019s made some friends along the way too. With a little help from the Morrigan and Coyote, he succeeds in throwing them off his trail by faking his own death. But making a deal with a trickster god, however benign it may seem, is never a good idea! Pretty soon, Atticus has to face an even worse enemy \u2013 one he\u2019s learned very little about in his two thousand years of existence.Coyote is a common enough character in urban fantasy. I liked him in Patricia Briggs\u2019 River Marked, really loved him in Allyson James\u2019 Stormwalker series, but I think Hearne came closest to what I imagine a trickster god would be like. Both Briggs and James portrayed him as mischievous, but ultimately benevolent; however, Hearne clouded his intentions a little bit, made him even more unpredictable, and quite a bit dangerous. This is the first time that I really felt the tiredness and the emotional depth I would expect from someone with two thousand years of experience. Atticus has millennia of losses on his shoulders and I loved that Hearne explored that part of him a little bit. I understand why he can\u2019t dwell on his emotions too often, I do, but it\u2019s unavoidable sometimes even for him. It was a nice change. \nUsually I try to suppress any emotions that savor of regret, because they are invariably aperitifs to a main course of depression, and for the long-lived, that\u2019s a recipe for suicide. But that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t sneak up on me sometimes. And, like, gang-tackle me.\nAs for the romance, in the interview he gave the lovely Missie at The Unread Reader, Hearne promised us a love interest for Atticus in Tricked, and he certainly didn\u2019t lie. But if you\u2019re expecting some big romance, you might end up disappointed. There are just subtle hints of one, more reluctant attraction than anything else, and it doesn\u2019t affect the plot in any way. I, for one, appreciate this about the series. If I want romance, I read PNR. That\u2019s not to say that I wouldn\u2019t be happy if Atticus and the person he\u2019s interested in get their HEA, I would. I just don\u2019t think it needs to be a priority for Hearne. I had pre-ordered this book about three months before the release date, just to be on the safe side (my paranoia knows no limits \u2013 what if ALL the copies were sold before I managed to get one?), and I will pre-order the next one. Hearne can easily be forgiven for this weak link in the series, he has more than earned it with the first three books.Also posted at The Nocturnal Library"}, {"userName": "Carol.

And so far, that has been the case (at least in my opinion) with The Iron Druid Chronicles.Atticus O\u2019Sullivan is on the lam with his Druidic apprentice and his faithful hound. The only way to stay safe is to convince the gods of all the pantheons that he\u2019s dead. Really, really dead. To accomplish this without actually dying, he gains the aid of Coyote, the Native American trickster god, and stages a battle royale against thunder gods from multiple pantheons. After basically hacking him to pieces, the whole world is convinced that the last Druid is no more. There\u2019s a downside, through. Now, Atticus owes Coyote a favor. A big one. Unfortunately, nothing is ever straightforward with a trickster god.There\u2019s so much to enjoy in this book. Character development, setting, mythos, lore, and magic all make for an incredibly compelling story. But as with all of the books in this series thus far, what makes it for me is the humor. Man, these books are funny. Atticus himself is always sassy, which makes him my favorite leading man in any urban fantasy series I\u2019ve found. His apprentice is plenty sassy in her own right, and I love watching her cope with all the crazy stuff she learns through life experiences at the side of the last druid. Hearne has a gift for creating really fun secondary characters, as well. But my absolute, hands down, very favorite character in the entire series is Oberon, Atticus\u2019s faithful Irish wolfhound. Through their mental link, Oberon is able to express himself and offer his own commentary on current events. Said commentary is what keeps me glued to these books, because it is legitimately laugh out loud funny. I love when an author is able to make an animal a fairly central character in a book, and this is just about the best I\u2019ve seen that characterization handled. Is it cheating to include Oberon with the host of literary animals who are unable to voice their thoughts? Undoubtedly. Do I care? NOPE. Oberon is sarcastic, irreverent, and intelligent. His cultural references (from all that tv he watches while Atticus is at work) are spot on. His love of all things meat and his vendetta against cats and squirrels are just enough to remind readers that he is, in fact, canine. I don\u2019t know how to properly express my love for this fictional hound, but suffice it to say that he\u2019s my favorite aspect of a series I\u2019m loving more and more with each installment.Something I can\u2019t stress strongly enough: if you aren\u2019t opposed to audiobooks, this series really shines in its audio form. I\u2019ve always preferred the written word to audiobooks, and I always will, but this series is simply a pleasure to listen to. While the books are still great when read in physical form (I read some just to make sure), this is one of the few series I\u2019ve come across that I truly believe is far better in audio form. Luke Daniels does a fantastic job narrating this series, and I\u2019ve enjoyed every minute of my listening experience. I\u2019ve already started the next book!"}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "A trickster god has fun with Atticus and Granuaile!Kevin Hearne\u2019s Iron Druid chronicles continues with Tricked, the fourth novel in the series (there are also several short stories and novellas). Though the series, as such, has devolved into a serial re-hashing of the original cool idea of a two thousand year old last druid, his sexy ginger apprentice and his wise cracking sidekick Irish wolfhound \u2013 Hearne has a winning formula. Essentially mixing in the comparative theological funkiness of Gaiman\u2019s American Gods with a hip urban fantasy salute to Jim Butcher\u2019s Dresden Files; Hearne has a virtually limitless literary tree from which to pick.Tricked sees our three protagonists on the lamb in Arizona and swapping tricks with the Native American trickster god Coyote. Also making appearances are litigious werewolves, a PTSD vampire, a putrescent Norse god, and a couple of super fast Navajo skinwalkers.Hearne also introduces a Kwai Chang Caine type flashback to his arch druid master in ancient Ireland.

At least, nothing stronger than an acquaintance or a business relationship. And I felt that, had that been there, it would have given me something to connect with and follow as an ongoing development in amongst all the other general badassery that the books are jam-packed with. The only person Atticus really gave two hoots about up until now, as far as I could tell, was his hound Oberon. But in this instalment we have a developing friendship, a teacher-student relationship, a cute bit of flirting and also a betrayal that really added that bit of personal drama I'd been looking for previously.Now onto the rest of the badassery I mentioned. This time, the mythology was mostly Native American in origin. Atticus has called in Coyote to help him stage his own death so that he might be able to stay in one place long enough to train Granuaille in her Druidry in relative peace. It's always easier to concentrate on a chemistry lesson when you don't have someone trying to take your head off, after all. Of course, Coyote, being the little trickster deity that he is, wanted something in return. That's how these things generally work. And so begins the part where it all goes to hell in a handbasket. I really loved the plot for TRICKED. I thought it had excellent pacing, the mythology was interesting, the action scenes were exciting and, of course, there were some hilarious dialogue passages thrown in there for good measure. And this time, not only were Atticus and Oberon hilarious together, but Granuaille can hold her own in the conversations too! She had a couple of great lines. There was an ongoing point-scoring game that carried on throughout most of the book which provided many laugh-out-loud moments. A favourite quote from that game between Atticus and Oberon was:\"Heh. I think you made your point, Atticus.\"\"Gods Below, Oberon, that was horrendous! You just violated the Schwarzenegger Pun Reduction Treaty of 2010.\"\"What? No, that didn't qualify!\"\"Yes, it did. Any pun related to a weapon's destructive capabilities or final disposition of a victim's body is a Schwarzenegger pun, by definition. That's negative twenty sausages according to the sanctions outlined in Section Four, Paragraph Two.\"My hound whined. \"No! Not twenty sausages! Twenty succulent sausages I'll never snarf? You can't do that - it's cruelty to animals!\"\"You can't argue with this. Your pawprint is on the treaty, and you agreed that Schwarzenegger puns are heinous abominations of language that deserve food-related punishments for purposes of correction and deterrence.\"\"Auggh! I still say it's your fault for renting Commando in the first place! You started it!\"As with the rest of the series, I listened to it in audiobook format. There aren't many series that I would honestly rather listen to than read, but this is definitely one of them. Luke Daniels is a narrating genius, and he really upped my enjoyment level. I don't know, if I'd have read them myself, that Oberon would have been quite as funny to me as he is, but the voice Daniels uses for him is so incredibly perfect and hound-like and just adorably enthusiastic- exactly as you'd expect a mind-speaking dog to be- that it just makes it a delightfully enjoyable and entertaining experience.There was an excerpt at the end from the next book, Trapped, which I am now VERY excited to read to see how my new favourite UF trio are faring.Well done Mr. Hearne.

And, by gives him a hand, he becomes Atticus's body double and lets the assorted thunder gods think they've chopped Atticus into itty-bitty pieces. Soon enough the real Atticus finds himself wrangled by Coyote into fighting brutal skinwalkers. Just as Atticus thinks he's starting to get a handle on things again, betrayal comes from an unexpected direction. Atticus won't be fooled again, if he survives this time that is. I'm so excited to be back to the awesome The Iron Druid Chronicles! I have so much love for this series. This time around the experience was a bit different, but still just as great. This time I read the paperback copy rather than listen to the excellent audiobook narration provided by Luke Daniels. Honestly, while reading I had his voice in the back of my mind the entire time, and just how he sounded in general in mind. Some of my pronunciation of the Irish (and Navajo) words were probably quite off, because I either couldn't remember how it sounded or because it was one I had never heard said aloud before. Regardless, I had a great time getting to know some of my favorite characters again. On that note, as much as I like Atticus, Granuaile (I love her relationship with her sensei), and Oberon (a close second favorite, here), I think Coyote easily manages to steal all of his scenes. He really manages to shake things up, and it was good to see Atticus face something he's not all that familiar with from the start. Overall, The Iron Druid Chronicles by Kevin Hearne just keeps getting better and better! I could go on and on about this book, but I'll just save time and tell you to pick up this book (or start this series from the beginning), especially if you're a fan of urban fantasy in the vein of The Dresden Files by Jim Butcher or the television series Supernatural.

I was glad to have Oberon the wolfhound back, being his usual goofy self. I was also glad to know a bit more about apprentice Granuaile and to get some background info on Atticus.I was sorry that Atticus and Leif ended up at odds with one another\u2014I will miss their Shakespeare quote battles and Atticus instructing the unwilling vampire on how to appear more modern, something which Atticus excels at. For someone who is supposed to be preserving the earth, Atticus spends an awful lot of time haring off on missions determined by others. Some of this was pay back, of course, paying back Coyote for services rendered and dealing with blow-back from the book 3 mission under taken to humour Leif. One would think that a Druid as aged as Atticus would be less focused on honour and more focused on the big picture\u2014keeping the earth healthy and building the relationships that will help him through the next 1000 years.I still feel that Granuaile is being under-utilized\u2014hopefully this will be rectified in upcoming books. My hope is also that Atticus can settle down again and develop another circle of interesting friends (similar to the first two books). Having an awesome main character is great, but good supporting characters can kick things up a notch, in my opinion.

That's bound to make my reviews biased. I will concede that point. However, I am also a huge fan of the series, the characters, and the world Hearne has created. It's from this second position that I'm writing my review.Let's face it - if you're considering buying Tricked, you've already read the first three books and enjoyed them. That being the case, you will love this book as much as the rest of the series, and maybe even more. Let's run down the list...1) Kick ass fights and danger? Check - Atticus has fought gods, demons, and all other manner of nastiness in between. But the main enemies in this book are more than a match for Atticus - he has his work cut out for him. And he takes his lumps along the way, believe me.2) Humor and wit? Check - Hearne's sense of humor and snark are as present as ever. And for those of you who missed Oberon in Hammered, never fear! Atticus's best friend is a nearly constant companion in this book as he was in Hounded.3) All of the supporting characters we know and love? Check - we get to find out what happened to the Widow (and it's not what you're thinking!! ;-) ), Granuaile continues to develop her skills, confidence, and role in the series, and there is a MAJOR development with another secondary character that made jump out of my chair! (I won't spoil anything here - you'll just have to wait.) And maybe best of all, the book features a LOT of Coyote. He cracks me up, and I love having such an important and likable character that nevertheless can't be trusted by Atticus.4) A fully realized world with interesting cultures and world views? Check - Atticus leaves the big city and spends time with the Navajo, and we get a glimpse of their culture and beliefs. Hearne does a great job of respecting their culture and weaving it into the world he's already established with the series.You won't have to wait long to get in to this book. The opening chapter is the best opening chapter of any in the series, and Atticus's monologue on the first page is hands-down my favorite page of the entire series. :-)"}, {"userName": "Rissa", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41794459-rissa", "userReview": "Tricked 4\u2b50\ufe0fOberon (the dog, i listen to the books so i dont know how to spell his name) is wonderful and makes the trials and adventure lighter and brings the book back to reality.

After Coyote helps him, he is indebted to him and finds himself on an Arizona reservation with Oberon and his apprentice Granuaile.Coyote is an interesting\u00a0character and one I have encountered in other novels. He is immortal, and a known trickster. Hearne kept me guessing about his true intentions. This kept me on edge and I\u00a0wavered back and forth in worrying about Atticus.\u00a0 Thanks to a warning from the Morrigan, Atticus keeps a close eye on Coyote too but even he is unsure.What I loved most about Tricked was the depth the author brought to Atticus.

Her prophesy was actually a deal that Atticus brokered with Coyote in the previous book, something readers/listeners were not privy to at that time. Coyote shifted to look like Atticus and then let the remaining, avenging Norse pantheon kill him, with the help of a few thunder gods. Now Atticus, Granuaile, and Oberon must move on, but first Atticus must fulfill his promise to help Coyote move some earth. Well, knowing that Coyote is a trickster god means nothing is as it would appear.After the self-serving adventures into Asgard that dominated the previous title, I was thankful to see that there were indeed consequences to Atticus\u2019s actions. Hel has been unleashed on Earth, and she looks to start Ragnar\u00f6k for her father, Loki. While this wasn\u2019t the primary plot of the book, I was glad Atticus now realizes the mistakes he made when he indulged Leif\u2019s vengeance. And speaking of Leif\u2026 he is back, and he has changed. Or maybe he hasn\u2019t changed, but now that he\u2019s used Atticus for the purpose he intended, we are privy to his true vampiric nature.I enjoyed Tricked for its Native American-based mythology. While I have no clue how much of it is based in actual beliefs, I found the story engrossing and the mythology interesting. My favorite character was the Navajo spiritual leader who brought a new level of spiritual magic to Atticus, and conversely, he learned much about the earth\u2019s magic from Atticus. Their temporary bond was genuine and fruitful. It looks to me like the series is heading for change, with the farewells in the previous book, Hammered, and the start of new identities in Tricked. Atticus wants to focus on training apprentice Granuaile, who he is also completely taken with. I love his awkwardness around her. I also enjoyed how he opened up about his own long life to her. Granuaile, in turn, shares some secrets with Atticus that she had been internalizing. Their bond is growing stronger. I also really like the development of Oberon\u2019s character. He\u2019s becoming an intelligent, humorous sidekick. His nature has matured and grown into more than \u201cman\u2019s best friend.\u201dLuke Daniels remains a strong narrator, once again adding a number of different voices and accents to his already huge repertoire. His voice for Oberon has matured, while still remaining dog-like, which suits the character well. I was also glad that the Navajo voices were nothing like Coyote, who did have a big roll in this book. Although Coyote\u2019s voice still grated on me, it wasn\u2019t as bad this time because Atticus no longer imitated Coyote\u2019s inflections; keeping his true voice was a hundred times more enjoyable.Overall, I enjoyed listening to Tricked. I liked seeing Atticus deal with the outcomes of his actions from the previous book. It\u2019s refreshing that the 2,000 year old Druid is humble enough to still learn new things, yet remains arrogant enough to survive. I have to imagine after living that long, you can get set in your ways and let grudges grow, but he is good at letting go. I like the deepening relationship with Granuaile, and Oberon was plain excellent.Book: B+Narration: A-"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/933015-julie", "userReview": "I have to admit that I didn\u2019t finish \u201cHammered\u201d, the previous book in this series, because it veered off into Canterbury Tales land and I lost interest. This book was a return to the first two books, where the focus of the story is on Atticus and his challenges and commitments.As this book opens, Coyote helps Atticus fake his own death (because of events in the previous book) in return for a favor. That favor turns out to be two-fold: one thing upfront and one thing that Atticus is tricked into doing. Hence the title. Coyote claims he wants to do something meaningful for his people. He has decided that building renewable energy components and starting up a renewable energy power plant are the way to go. But the tribe needs money to do this, and his solution is that they will first open a gold mine, mine it out, and use the profits to start the renewable energy program. If you are scratching your head here, you\u2019re with me--let\u2019s rip up the environment before doing something meant to preserve it?Coyote wants Atticus to talk to the Colorado elemental and have it move a large quantity of gold to a specific location that Coyote has already chosen. Oh, and he also wants Atticus to kill two shape-shifters that have been plaguing the area where Coyote intends to start up his mining-renewable energy project. The shape-shifters turn out to be the main problem that Atticus has to solve in this book.I did like that this book focused more on Atticus and Granueil, his Druid apprentice who is forced to fake her own death as well. Granueil is my favorite character other than Atticus and I hope we get to see more of her in future books. Oberon is still too-smart for a dog, but he\u2019s good comic relief, and he proves his bravery when Atticus\u2019s vampire acquaintance Hal manipulates Atticus into solving a problem with a rival vampire. We also get to hear a bit more about how and when Atticus came to North America. All good stuff.However, I found the eco-terrorism aspect of this story rather glib and hypocritical. As part of his efforts to persuade the Colorado elemental to move gold to where Coyote wants is, Atticus sabotages the local coal mine. Several times. He rationalizes this by thinking that the corporation has lots of money and it will be just fine for it to lose its operation. Little thought is given to all the middle-class workers that will be out of work; there is a throw-away line about how they can work at the new gold mine that the tribe will be starting, disregarding that it takes months to get a mine up and going. It\u2019s also implied from the storyline that the tribe mining gold was OK economically and environmentally, but coal mining by others was not. My Kindle has lots of \u201cWTF???\u201d whenever this occurs.Overall, 3 stars. It would easily have been a high four star if the environmental issues had been dealt with in a more thoughtful and intelligent manner."}, {"userName": "Ami", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134600-ami", "userReview": "[after what Atticus has done to Leif in the next book, I cannot believe that Leif is tricking Atticus to kill Leif's vampire master, which ends up hurting both Atticus and Oberon.

Kevin Hearne knows his way around Urban Fantasy. He continually amazes me. This time around, my favorite Druid \u2013 Atticus O\u2019Sullivan, ends up dealing with Native American legends come to life. This story starts by quickly wrapping the cliffhanger from Hammered or rather, switching from the drama that came with an out-of-control thunder god Thor to the well-known Trickster, Coyote. I can\u2019t say I missed the Norse gods with their impossibly mentally to pronounce names. Compared, the Native American god system is \u201cPantheon-Lite\u201d. So right off the bat, I was pleased that I did not need to Google or hit Wikipedia to gain a semblance of understanding.There is plenty of action, magic, and Oh No moments. The pacing is spot on as well. There are some new characters that really didn\u2019t do much for me. I sorta thought of them as the Star Trek \u2018Away Team\u2019 and never got past considering them fodder. Old friends come back and become pivotal players, especially Granuaile and Oberon the hound. I was shocked by developments with the Widow MacDonagh and Leif the vampire. When good friends go bad\u2026it\u2019s not pretty that\u2019s all I can say. The main nasty of nasties are the Skin Walkers. Mr. Hearne taught me more about the Navajo legendary creatures than I ever learned watching Supernatural. They were pretty scary. The vampires were more prominent than I expected and I was saddened by how the storyline played into a change in Atticus.So who \u2018Tricked\u2019 Atticus? That\u2019s a question with many answers that you will only learn and understand by reading this book. This book is not really a stand alone in my opinion like the first two. This is more like the second part of a duology. If you are thinking of trying Iron Druid Chronicles, don\u2019t start with this one. The next installment is called Trapped and takes place twelve years after this book when Granuaile has completed her Druid training. The first chapter is included as bonus trac at the end of Tricked."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76688-eric", "userReview": "I still liked this book a good deal despite not enjoying the main story-line all that much. While the previous subplot involving Coyote in Hexed was interesting, this was just too much of a character that should be used sparingly -- I mean who wants to spend an excessive amount of time with a god that will undoubtedly trick you at every opportunity? And, in the case of this series, that time comes at the cost of spending time with some great supporting characters, like Hal Hauk, The Morrigan, Leif Helgarson (although his short cameo is awesome), and Atticus's apprentice Granuaile, who I'd really like to see become a full druid already."}, {"userName": "Kimberley doruyter", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23952659-kimberley-doruyter", "userReview": "wow"}, {"userName": "Dark Faerie Tales", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2766672-dark-faerie-tales", "userReview": "Review courtesy of Dark Faerie Tales.Quick & Dirty: This amazing series continues with another dark and humorous filled tale with the Druid Atticus, his dog Oberon and Granuaile. I highly recommend this series.Opening Sentence: The best trick I ever pulled off was watching myself die.The Review:The Iron Druid Chronicles is an amazing series and continues its greatness with Tricked. If you have a love for any kind of mythology, you have to give this series a try. The attention to detail about the many gods from different pantheons and other supernatural creatures make this a dark, but fun series.Tricked is the fourth novel in the Iron Druid series. It picks up not too long after Atticus has come back from Asgard where he and a misfit group took out Thor. Knowing that a bunch of gods are after his two thousand year old arse, Atticus plans his death. Using the god Coyote in his place, Atticus appears to be killed with several gods looking on. But it is all good for Coyote, he revives after each of his deaths plus he needs Atticus\u2019s help in order to gain wealth for his people.Atticus is led to believe that Coyote just wants land to be reshaped for a wind farm plus a gold mine to help with money issues. Unwittingly, Atticus has been lead into a war with two powerful skinwalkers fighting over that same land. Atticus works with a hataalii (not exactly a medicine man but that is the best way to describe him) in order to use the magic of the First World (the belief system of the native people on the land) to help in defeating the skinwalkers.For a dead man, Atticus has to fight several wars on different fronts, one with the skinwalkers, one with a former vampire friend, plus, a new war has begun with Hel as she unleashes a powerful weapon that has the scent of Atticus\u2019s blood. She will unleash Ragnarok and she will do it with or without Atticus\u2019s help. He must do all this while training his one and only Druid initiate Granuaile.Tricked is an action packed nonstop rollercoaster that is all over the place. Each story and fight intertwines with the other. The story is told strictly through Atticus\u2019s first person point of view. Atticus is such a humorous, sarcastic and refreshing personality. His interactions with his dog Oberon really bring comic relief to the overall dark storyline. The atmosphere of this story has everything I enjoy from humor to drama to horror.The attention to detail on the mythology may bog down the story a wee bit for people who don\u2019t like that but I enjoy it because I love to learn about different myths from all over the world. The action scenes are very meticulous and it is easy to follow along with the fights.Overall, Tricked is a dark and humorous story filled with many mythological gods and creatures. Some you may have heard of and others you may not have. I really enjoy these books for the mythological basis they have and the fact that I feel like I am learning about some gods I don\u2019t really know about but would love to learn more. I highly recommend this series for fans of mythology and will continue to keep this series near the top of my \u201cto read list\u201d.Notable Scene:A snarl and an abrupt pressure announced the arrival of Oberon: He jumped on top of the vampire\u2019s back, and thus on top of me, and did his best to bite through the vampire\u2019s skull. It successfully distracted the vampire, because he tore loose from my neck, hissing, and coldly threw Oberon\u2014all hundred and fifty pounds of him\u2014straight through the open door to slam forcefully against the wall in the papered hallway. I heard his bones break and a pained yelp, closely followed by a startled scream from Granuaile, who was out there, and then the sound of my friend crumpling to the floor.He had saved my life, because that gave me enough time to finish my unbinding and turn the vampire into a gory accident. He squelched and folded inside his suit until he was naught but a legendary dry-cleaning bill in the middle of the room. I tried to get out of the bed to help Oberon and instead tumbled into the carnage on the floor, too weak to keep my feet. I was still bleeding from the neck, and I had no magic left to heal myself.\u201cCall a vet!\u201d I managed weakly. They were better last words, I supposed, than many others. I could see Granuaile kneeling next to Oberon, and he wasn\u2019t moving. I couldn\u2019t hear him in my mind either. Granuaile looked up from Oberon\u2019s still form at someone\u2019s approach in the hall. Her mouth dropped open.Leif Helgarson strolled casually into the room, hands in pockets, a smirk on his misshapen face. It widened into a broad smile when he saw the remains in which I wallowed.\u201cCongratulations, Atticus,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have just killed a vampire nearly as old as yourself. That was Zdenik, erstwhile lord of Prague and, briefly, the state of Arizona.\u201dNo wonder he\u2019d been so strong. \u201cYou . . . sent him here?\u201d I said.Leif removed his hands from his pockets and held them up helplessly. \u201cWere you not the one who told me to orchestrate the deaths of my rivals? I have merely done as you suggested. Thank you for playing your part.\u201dThe oxygen leeched out of the room at his words, and all I could breathe in was horror. What he\u2019d done to Oberon and me\u2014and possibly Granuaile\u2014was all for his worthless territory games? The edges of my vision were going black; my blood was still leaking out of my neck, and I could not think of anything to say that would adequately convey the depth of my revulsion and loathing for him now. If I had the strength left, I would have unbound him on the spot; having no recourse, I fell back on Shakespeare. Leif would recognize it and understand the context properly. With my remaining few seconds of consciousness, I quoted Benedick from Much Ado About Nothing, who spoke these words to his former friend: \u201cYou are a villain: I jest not.\u201d And then I collapsed into a pool of my own blood.FTC Advisory: I purchased my own copy of Tricked. No goody bags, sponsorships, \u201cmaterial connections,\u201d or bribes were exchanged for my review."}, {"userName": "Mihir", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229652-mihir", "userReview": "Review originally at Fantasy Book Critic ANALYSIS: When it comes to Kevin Hearne, after his fantastic debut last year and the two sequels released in quick succession, it was hard not to be enthralled by his creations. With the epic climax of Hammered, fans everywhere were waiting to see what direction Kevin would take Atticus and Oberon next. Tricked was written and ready to be released and so when I got the opportunity to get an ARC for it, I was over the moon.Tricked is a hard book to review because of two reasons namely, it\u2019s the fourth book of the series and secondly because a lot of its plot details are spoilers for the preceding three titles. I must warn readers that I\u2019ll be trying to avoid spoilers as much as possible however there will be some minor spoilers and those readers who haven\u2019t read the first three books can avoid the review ahead.Tricked begins with a short soliloquy similar to the first book however this one is even more outrageous than its predecessor, it begins with the following lines:\u201cThe best trick I ever pulled off was watching myself die. I did a respectable job of it too \u2013 the dying, I mean, not the watching!\"With such a terrific line begins the fourth entry of the chronicles of Atticus the lone druid who\u2019s witty, versatile and now hunted by the thunder gods of various pantheons for his actions across Hammered. He however has a couple of tricks up his sleeve and he turns to one of the ultimate tricksters of yore to help him in his task. This of course works on \u201cscratch my back and I scratch yours\u201d principle and while Atticus thinks he has it under control. Coyote of course manages to one up him with his version of a request. Not to add to his troubles is his past catching up in the form of the widow Mrs. MacDonagh as well as the other mythical monsters that Atticus has had dealings with. All in all Tricked is a riptide of trickery and treachery in various degrees. The ending and twists in this book manage to convey quite a many tribulations for our hero ahead and yet also give us a sound ending.Kevin Hearne shines again with the this volume losing none of his charm and smooth prose. The story opens with Atticus who is yet the charming and rogue-ish narrator even after the events that have caused such an upheaval in the physical and meta-physical world. He is one of the best main characters currently present in the urban fantasy genre simply because of his ability to make the reader empathize with him and make the reader forget that he\u2019s a guy who more than two millennia old. In this story we learn more about his past as well as his present mistakes, both of which will have a tremendous impact on the story as it\u2019s unfolding and the way it will unfold in the future as well. A few of the revelations have been hinted in the previous books however their actual revelation really might stun the reader with the depth of the truth.Tricked also manages to tie in with the short story \u201cA Test of Mettle\u201d with the actual saga and it also shows the possible repercussions of the event. There\u2019s also the matter of side character cast who are given a larger role and this includes Granuaile, Oberon and a certain other recurring character. The humor content is never under question as with the presence of Oberon who manages to outdo himself with his zingy one-liners and ever-present humorous chatter, in the previous book due to certain events,Oberon wasn't present for much of the storyline. However this situation is suitably rectified over here. Kevin also includes a new mythology in this book hereby exploring native American legends and monsters. This new mythology also is made to fit perfectly in this myriad world wherein all pantheons exist and co-habitat the world. This aspect of Kevin's world is one which has been unique so far and he continues to unveil a new corner of the world with each book. Many readers will be surprised to find quite another mythology make a cameo in this book and this possibly heralds a future appearance so be on the lookout.The only downside I can think about this book is that it\u2019s a bridge novel that is supposed to set up the events for the next part of the saga. In that respect this book is like \"A Feast For Crows\" without the unnecessary cliffhangers and the missing cast. There are some sections about Atticus' past which could have been explored further to show how complicated a character he is, but that would have made the story slacken and therefore was avoided. I however would still like to read more about his past and perhaps from another narrator to avoid the character's own bias. It also has a complete ending that gives us a strong hint of what might come next.CONCLUSION: Kevin Hearne\u2019s Tricked manages to combine the fun aspects of the previous books and give the saga a darker turn to make this book more akin to a thriller. It marks an exciting return to the world of Atticus and Oberon, give Tricked along with the rest of the Iron Druid Chronicles a chance and you won\u2019t regret it. An excellent entry that only heightens the wait for Trapped that is due in November this year."}, {"userName": "Jenn", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6865218-jenn", "userReview": "If there's one thing I've made clear since joining Tynga's Reviews, it's probably my adoration of Kevin Hearne's Iron Druid Chronicles, and of Kevin Hearne in general. His blog cracks me up, his books take me on a ride every time I read them (and believe me when I say I have read these books multiple times), and his nerd cred is through the roof. (Did you see his \"When I'm not writing\" post?) Needless to say, my fangirl heart has high expectations when it comes to his books because they keep getting more and more epic. Luckily for us, Kevin has done an amazing job with TRICKED: Kevin delivers not only an thrilling adventure rooted in Native American mythology but also a story with humour, action, and lots of surprises, *and* he gives us some closure about some of the characters who he left behind. I don't think a single reader will be disappointed with TRICKED because it's jam-packed with awesomeness.This time around, Atticus is in a new place. He, Granuaile, and Oberon have abandoned their old lives and faked Atticus' death so that he can train Granuaile in peace and not have to look over his shoulder for vengeful gods. Unfortunately, the relative peace doesn't last very long since he's made a deal with Coyote. And if there's one thing reading mythology and urban fantasy has taught me, it's that you're never going to come out the winner when you make a deal with a trickster god. As a reader, however, I was pleased as punch to see Coyote back on the scene. I think he's a great character - the drawl, the one-upmanship, the way he calls Atticus \"Mr. Druid\" - and he's the source of a lot of the humour, and the trouble, in TRICKED.A lot of this trouble comes in the shape of skinwalkers. Skinwalkers have been portrayed in different ways, depending on whose lore or treatment you're reading, but they're almost universally evil. (There are, of course, exceptions, like the way that they were portrayed on Haven, but my not-empirically-tested opinion is that they're never good guys.) In TRICKED, they're evil, powerful, and smart, which is great because it means Atticus has to work to win. In fact, he's very out of his element because he hasn't had much experience with Native American magic and it was a nice change of pace to see him take on a learning role, despite his 2,000+ years of experience.Even with all of the crazy skinwalker-related antics, Kevin manages to add in some really funny moments, usually with Coyote or Oberon. Oberon was especially ridiculous this time around, which I appreciated. Happily, Granuaile also gets some nice moments in the novel, showing us why she's a great apprentice. We also get to see Atticus and Granuaile tackle their sexual tension and come to a sensible, if not necessarily reader satisfying, conclusion.I'm tempted to go on and on about how glorious TRICKED is but I'm worried some of my thoughts would be too close to spoilers, which wouldn't be fair. I'll leave off with this:Bottom line: Kevin Hearne has delivered another fast-paced, character-driven, entertaining instalment of the Iron Druid Chronicles. It'll leave you breathless from laughter, a little grossed out in places, and dying for the fall, when TRAPPED comes out.http://www.tyngasreviews.com"}, {"userName": "Kristin  (MyBookishWays Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3491365-kristin-mybookishways-reviews", "userReview": "You may also read my review here: http://www.mybookishways.com/2012/04/...In book 4 of the superb Iron Druid series, we rejoin my favorite Druid, Atticus O\u2019Sullivan, and the Morrigan in the Arizona desert, as they prepare to watch as Atticus rather spectacularly fakes his own death, with the help of the trickster Coyote, of course. Yes, you read that right. Atticus is about to watch \u201chimself\u201d be obliterated by a few gods that want him dead (see book 3, Hammered.) What follows is indeed spectacular, and laugh out loud funny as the gods discuss Atticus\u2019 demise with Morrigan (playing her role with aplomb.) Well, now that Atticus is \u201cdead\u201d, he\u2019s feeling pretty good, since, for the first time, no one is after him, and he can train his apprentice, Granuaile, in peace. Yeah, riiiiight. We all know that Atticus is kind of a trouble magnet, in spite of his best efforts, right? Indeed, Coyote, who was a big part of Atticus\u2019 faked death, needs a favor, and it\u2019s a biggie. Coyote wants to help out his people, who are suffering in a dying town, but little does Atticus know, this also involves fighting some extremely nasty skinwalkers. Think berserker Tasmanian devils with one track minds set to \u201ckill, kill, kill.\u201d Yes, they\u2019re that bad. Oh wait, add some pretty hefty magic to that equation too. Atticus is tough, but the skinwalkers are off the charts. Then there\u2019s that pesky vamp problem\u2026If you haven\u2019t discovered this series, yet, get thee to a bookstore and snag \u2018em, or download them, however you roll, because it just keeps getting better and better. I laughed so hard during the first half of this book that I may have squirted tears a couple of times, and the action in this one pretty much never lets up. Poor Atticus is also put through so much, physically, that I was genuinely worried for my fave Druid a couple of times. There\u2019s lots of meaty stuff in this one, and the author wraps up some major story arcs and gives Atticus and Co. a fresh start. The author takes a bit of a break from the thunder gods to tackle Navajo lore, which I found fascinating, and we also got to know Granuaile a lot better (she\u2019s smart, kicks butt, and has Atticus\u2019 back at all times.) Oberon, the big, adorable, meat-lovin\u2019 ball of awesome that is Atticus\u2019 longtime friend and Irish wolfhound, is funnier than ever and his heroics in this one might get you a little bit teary.The problem with these books is, upon finishing, I want to gush and tell everyone all about it, and I want to tell you, my loyal readers, all about it too, but that would totally spoil the fun, yeah? Reading an Atticus book is like visiting a lifelong friend and knowing you\u2019re always going to have a kick-ass time. How Kevin Hearne does it Every. Single. Time, I have no idea, but he does, and he just keeps piling on the awesome. Tricked is packed with thoroughly engrossing characters, fascinating mythology, creatures that will make your head spin, lots of action, and a ton of heart. I dare you to give this series a try and NOT fall completely in love!

I wasn't sure at the time whether I would go back and read them later or not.I don't plan to.So, what's good and what's bad? Well, I can see what people who love the series like. There is action and humor aplenty and the dialogue is well done. The books get plotted out and follow that line to the end.Sadly it struggles to stay with the plot fairly often as the author is so very concerned with converting us to his beliefs and point of view. He uses the time honored practice of avoiding having to actually come up with a logical explanation or defense of his stands by simply telling a story where they are assumed to be true.I did get very tired of the \"hoo-doo\" science.Also I just couldn't bring myself to actually like Atticus. For a guy who's 2000 years old and (for now) bears the same name as one of my favorite literary heroes he's incredibly immature and selfish.
