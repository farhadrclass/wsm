The language in this book is some of the most beautiful I have ever read, next to Gabriel Garcia Marquez - it is lyrical and somehow sparkles on the page. It's simply gorgeous. Now, I have an Advanced Readers Copy, which I picked up at the Southern Festival of Books in Nashville two years ago, so I'm not entirely sure it is exactly the same as you'd find on the bookshelves, but in my experience the copies don't differ very much, if at all. Please, read this book. UPDATE: I cannot ever remember a book haunting me the way this one has. I just finished it on Sunday and am already ready to read it again, which I can say in all the years I've been reading, the thousands of books I've read, that has NEVER happened.

The story moves back and forth between memories of her life before she drowns in the late 1920s and her observations on the present, over seventy five years later, where she lives \"between\" life and death. In common parlance, Razi is a ghost--she has no physical form, but she can see, hear, and smell everything around her in the living world, as well as moving objects and herself telekinetically.At the beginning of the novel, Razi takes up residence with a young couple, Scott and Amy, by following a bookcase she knows from her life move from an estate sale into their home. As Scott and Amy's story unfolds in the present, so do Razi's memories of what happened between her and her fianc\u00e9, Andrew, in the years before her death. Slowly, the connection between Razi's past and her \"present\" become clear both to her and to the reader.The Mercy of Thin Air is a good book. It's a bit reminiscent of The Time Traveler\u2019s Wife by Audrey Niffenegger, which I loved (and, I'm told, Alice Seibold's The Lovely Bones), in subject matter and in its deft navigation of the line between being a believable love story and just being goopy. It's a book about the supernatural in which the supernatural is not the point, and I like that. It's a quick, easy read (took me two days), good for a plane, the beach, or before bed down time. Not something I'd recommend a chapter-a-night approach to, though, as I found it very difficult to put down.The Mercy of Thin Air is Ronlyn Domingue's first novel."}, {"userName": "Melodie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5788507-melodie", "userReview": "Razi( love that name!) a young woman who meets an untimely death, has never been a rule follower. She has bucked the traditional all her young life,studying with the intent of becoming a physician, distributing birth control information to women when it was not just \"unnatural\" but illegal. A true free spirit.And madly in love with her soul mate Andrew. So when she finds herself dead after a freak accident,she again makes the unconventional decision to not move on to her forever afterlife, but to remain \"in-between\". The years roll on and she has made a life for herself and even mad friends with some like-minded souls.But she is always looking for Andrew, unsure of what became of him.

That they are embarking on a slow inexorable drift away from one another.Can that drift be arrested, turned back? And can Razi ever find what became of her one true love? This is not a book for the linear thinker. The story line meanders to and fro,hither,thither and yon.If you love complex puzzles this book is for you.

I am crying... It was so beautiful... So heartbreaking .... So deep....It has been a while I have liked a book as much as I have liked this one... While trying to decide if I want to read Fifty Shades Of Gray (I will most likely not) and trying to make up my mind if I even like love stories at all after reading this book I have realized my problems are not with love stories, but with cheap and trashy love stories. There are so many of them that sometimes I feel like they even want to trick the readers and appear to have some literary value while they do not. Constantly researching good books to read I almost feel like I have to watch out not to be sucked in Twilights and Fifty Shades.I was reading the review of another book, which I don't even remember what it was, but I know that book was also written from the point of view of a character who is dead, the reviewer compared the two and was talking in superlatives about The Mercy Of Thin Air.... how correct he was!I don't mind any topics really, though I don't rush to the bookstore to buy the latest vampire story or time travel story, but I will read them if I think they will be worth it other than the subject matter. So I was with reading a book from the point of view of a dead girl. It was poetic, it was sexy (yes, there were some sex scenes, not many, very tasteful), and it was smart. It was about women, especially women's movement in the 20's, but it was also about men, men with souls and real feelings. And yes there was even a twist in it a little mystery. I was impressed how it was all pulled together with thoughts and ideas that I didn't think earlier in the book to be important nicely linked back to the end or the beginning... All through the book I was thinking, beautiful, I can't have enough, but she is going to screw it up at the end...or soon... definitely at the end.... and she didn't...It also helped that I loved the characters... I would love to be like Razi, maybe I am a little bit and oh yes I would like to find a guy like Andrew even though I am a happy single girl... I loved their strength, the way they communicated.... original, funny, smart, tolerant and radical at the same time. and the rest of the characters are the same way.It was an added plus that I live in the area where the story takes place... it is not important, it just made it more interesting to me.But what I loved the most was the language... the dreamlike beautifully weaved sentences... in a way it was like a painting with lots of colors and details... a time travel ..... a melody that will definitely stay in my ears for a long long time."}, {"userName": "Lisa Reads & Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5395843-lisa-reads-reviews", "userReview": "[ A woman during the 1920s decides to follow her longtime dream of going to medical school instead of postponing or giving her dream up for a man whom she loves intensely.

It shouldn't take me five days to read a book that's just about 300 pages long, but that's exactly what happened. I found myself finding other things to do instead of reading because I wanted to prolong the joy of reading it. I slowed down and savored each word, each sentence. I just didn't want it to end.But all good things must come to an end, and last night I finished it. And I mourned, just a little bit.Razi is a feisty, unconventional girl of the 1920s. Her goal in life is not, as society dictates, to find a husband and bear children. She wants to be a doctor, not a nurse, and be worthy in her own right, not because she's married to someone. She even becomes involved in disseminating information about birth control, an illegal topic in the 1920s and liable to send her to jail if she's found out. But then she dies in a tragic accident and fails to go on to whatever is next after we die. Instead she becomes, for all intents and purposes, a ghost. When her boyfriend's old bookcase is bought at an estate sale seventy years after her death, she follows the piece of furniture to its new home, introducing us to Amy and Scott, a married couple with secrets and problems of their own.The novel switches back and forth between Razi's life in the 1920s and Amy and Scott's lives in the 90s, and it works. I was never left feeling like I wanted to stay in one time period over the other; I was hungry to know what happened next. Somehow Domingue weaves both time periods together beautifully. This is not a novel about the supernatural. It just seems to be a plot point, not the whole reason for the novel. Razi is just as believable as a specter as she is in the flesh. I admit I was taken wholly by surprise by the twist near the end. I didn't see it coming, the way in which Amy and Razi were connected. But I was happy to see it work out that way.Domingue's writing is just so lyrical. Reading the words she lays down is a joy, and they are just so very evocative. It's like watching an old film unfold in your head while you read. I can see myself reading this book again soon, and I'm not the type to re-read novels anymore -- there are far too many books I want to read."}, {"userName": "Jacki", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1587840-jacki", "userReview": "For me, this book was just ok. When I read the back, I was really intrigued. A book written from a ghost's point of view, yadda yadda. Sounds good to me.Eh. The writing was only so-so, kind of shallow and the dialogue was pretty bad. People don't really talk like that. I also didn't like the author's idea of ghosts. To me, the 'rules' and the little 'quirky' things about the spirit world just sort of annoyed me. What I did like was the story of Scott & Amy, the modern couple sided up with the story of Razi & Andrew, the couple from the 20's. I liked how their stories paralleled and because of that how lessons were learned by all. Sometimes I accidently read too many books about death in a row and it becomes overwhelming.

You will be a character that I won\u2019t soon forget. And Amy, what do I think about you? Such a tortured girl you are. You remind me a bit of myself; not letting people who care about you in, not knowing who to trust, not trusting yourself. Your relationship with Scott will be etched in my memory for a long time.I wasn\u2019t quite sure what I was going to make of this book after reading the synopsis on the back cover. I\u2019m partial to the 1920\u2019s era, and New Orleans is one of my favorite cities in the U.S., so I was mildly interested to say the least. And the fact that the story included a ghost had me intrigued. But what came between the pages of this novel surprised me. The author\u2019s writing style was beautiful and I loved the way the words seemed to flow throughout the story adding layers and creating a moving picture of the life and loves of Raziela Nolan, a young girl in the 1920\u2019s, and Amy, a distant \u2018could-have-been\u2019 relation in the 1990's. How their lives would intertwine was a great mystery to unravel.Ronlyn Domingue crafted a strong, independent, brazen woman of the 1920's into Raziela who wasn't afraid to be herself and who wanted to make her own way in life even though she was living in a repressed society. A beautiful love story was written between Raziela (Razy) and Andrew, the man she falls in love with, and the struggles they both go through to be together yet live their lives the way they both wanted to. The way Ms Domingue chose the perfect illustrative language for how Razy felt when she was with Andrew, and what it felt like when they kissed and when they made love - this was breathtaking to me. There's no other way to put it. It was simple, yet lovely. I have to admit that I'm not a big 'crier' but I did tear up several times in this novel, and felt that pain in my heart when someone suffers great loss. The truth is that this book was sad; sad in the fact that there is tremendous loss throughout most of the pages. But with that sadness comes love, and learning, and hope. Something that I had lost sight of until the last several pages.

Yes, I agree with all points made regarding reproductive health and education but I guess that I am just not a person who lives and breaths my beliefs and political stance. It was an interesting portion of the story and in most parts I found it to be important to character development and understanding the fabulously brave and lively Razi but at other times I felt as if the author were pushing an agenda and when the subject matter was carried forward decades in the story with new characters it left a slightly unpleasant taste in my mouth. The connections between generations would have been strong without having this in common and it was at that point in the story that I had to sigh and roll my eyes a bit. This did not ruin the story for me mind you. I read it in a day and am left with that sad feeling I always get when I have finished a book and am going to miss the people that I have gotten to know and love within its pages.

While unraveling the mysteries of their relationship, Razi follows Amy and Scott through their turbulent relationship.What I loved about this novel was the slow unraveling of a mystery. Nothing in this novel is revealed in it's entirety or in chronological order. Clues are revealed when necessary through important events throughout Razi's or Amy's life. I enjoyed this because it made Razi's story telling more authentic. If it were told in chronological order per say, it would have felt like she was just going through the motions of life. Finally, I enjoyed the intertwining of Amy and Scott's relationship throughout the novel. It allows for a beautiful comparison and provides a more \"modern\" take on relationships. It shows how the love between two people does not change over the evolving generations.This novel is a fast read (I read it in less than a day) and it makes you believe in everlasting love."}, {"userName": "momruncraft", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/862171-momruncraft", "userReview": "One of the best, most unique books I've read in a long time.

Raziela Nolan is in the throes of a magnificent love affair when she dies in a tragic accident. In an instant, she leaves behind her one true love and her dream of becoming a doctor \u2013 but somehow, she still remains. Immediately after her death, Razi chooses to stay between - a realm that exists after life and before what lies beyond it. From this remarkable vantage point, Razi narrates the stories of her lost love, Andrew, and the relationship of Amy and Scott, a couple whose house she haunts almost seventy-five years later. My Reactions This is an ethereal novel that moves back and forth in time as Razi\u2019s spirit watches over Amy and Scott, but then takes time to recall her youth in 1920\u2019s New Orleans. Through the flashbacks we learn that she was a well-loved and nurtured child, with parents who applauded her successes and encouraged her dreams. She was a free spirit and liked being a little naughty as well (sometimes going about \u201cwithout any dainties\u201d under her clothing. Her awakening feminism fueled her desire to be a doctor, and also resulted in conflict between her and her beau, Andrew. But their love was stronger than the expectations of society and they were looking forward to a long and loving relationship when she died. Amy and Scott happen on an estate sale and buy an old bookcase for their home, and that is how Razi comes to haunt them. For the bookcase was Andrew\u2019s and still carries his scent. Razi has always wondered what happened to Andrew and now she cannot let that puzzle go. As she watches them, Razi realizes something is wrong in their marriage and she begins to play pranks (moving things about, pulling photos out of albums, dropping marbles) to bring them closer together. It\u2019s not working, though. Amy has own tragic past she is struggling to overcome. And then Amy goes to visit her great aunt Twolly, and Razi begins to finally put together the puzzle of what happened to Andrew. I liked Razi as a young feminist struggling to find her place in a world that had very clearly defined, and somewhat narrow, expectations for a young woman of her social class. I enjoyed her spirit, tenacity, intelligence, and courage. I thought her behavior as a ghost was somewhat out of keeping with the vibrant young woman she had been in life. Amy was a complete puzzle to me. I didn\u2019t understand her long-standing grief or why she completely shut her husband (and anyone else) out of her turmoil. I felt the way in which her story line was concluded was abrupt. I think the dual plot lines got away from Domingue. Still, this is her debut novel and she shows promise. I started out listening to the audio version, capably performed by Rebecca Gayheart. Her voices for Razi, Twolly, Andrew, Amy and Scott were believable and easy to differentiate. However, somewhere in the middle of disc two I was feeling lost in the plot and somewhat disconnected from the characters. Going to the text version to look up a certain passage I realized that the audio was abridged! Something that is not announced on the jacket, nor in the introduction to the novel.

Razi was a forward-thinking feminist in her day, illegally distributing birth control information and planning her career as a doctor - but she also fell deeply in love with a man named Andrew, and her ghost is haunted by their separation and the business between them that was left unfinished when she died suddenly. At present, Razi is living in the home of Amy and Scott, a young couple to which she feels an unusual connection. The two are happily married, but their happiness is threatened by Amy's unresolved memories of her first love - a young man who, like Razi, died suddenly in a tragic accident.

I never read past the first line of a book description because I don't want to know too much. This is a parallel/mirror story of Raziela (what kind of name is that and how do you pronounce it anyway? Rah-zee-la or Rah-zee-ella?) and Amy. One in 1929 dies and grieves for the love she left behind and the other in the present day is alive and grieves for the love who left her behind. It's a wispy, romantic, sentimental story that tries to be upright with characters who fight for women's rights and birth control availability and the right to choose. There are predictable women's themes of birth and babies, and there are cloche hats and antique peridot necklaces.

This is Domingue's first novel, so I think an editor should have done more to alert the readers to time changes. The problem wasn't just past and present, I thought at the beginning the main characters were in high school because they were applying for college--then later it said they *were* in college and applying for law/medical school. All the characters have very odd names, and I couldn't keep track of who was a friend, a relation, a ghost and the generations. I thought it took place in New Orleans, but then someone would say, you're visiting New Orleans? so they couldn't have been living there. I didn't get the premise either--why was Razi hanging around as a ghost if she didn't know what happened to Andrew? And, as a ghost, she was able to search on the computer, write letters and do physical things? Why would she make the electricity turn off and make the houses cold? Unlike Caspter she sure wasn't a friendly ghost even if her intentions were good."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1942293-becky", "userReview": "The day before I started this book, I was looking through some old photos that my mom had found in her basement...an album that belonged to my great-aunt, who was a young woman in the 1920s. The album was full of pictures from the 1920s-1930s, pictures of family, vacations, houses, and of my great-aunt and her friends. As I read about Razi and her life in the 1920s, I kept imagining these photographs and wondering what life was like for my great-aunt in those days. I would love to think she was like Razi in some way. The Mercy of Thin Air is a great read, I found it to be such a unique story line and I loved the way it jumped around in time. I don't know that I've ever read of two people more in love than Razi and Andrew...it was both heartwarming and heartbreaking."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030688-jennifer", "userReview": "I loved this book.

I raced through it, but when I came to the end, I just wasn't sure what I thought of it. Having had time to reflect, I did like it. I just keep wishing I could stop time and prevent the accident from happening. I couldn't stop imagining what Razi's life would have been like had she not died.The story jumps between Razi's current experiences watching Amy, Scott, and her old friends and flashbacks to before her accident. The further the story progressed, the more I found myself liking Razi and her character. Reading this kind of book provoked a number of questions, leaving me wondering even more than I had before I started reading. In a way, that is good, but it is also frustrating to walk away with no answers. This, though, is no fault of the author. They are the fundamental questions we all ask - what happens after death? is there an afterlife? The only thing that really bothered me is what happened to Andrew after Razi's death. I was disappointed in him for both moving on (marrying Sunny and starting a family) and not moving on (not going to Yale, settling on just teaching law). On one hand, it was good that he was able to start his life again, but it kind of bothered me that he chose to do so with someone so closely linked to Razi. His decision not to go to Yale also bothered me. If he wouldn't give up his dream for Razi while she was alive, then why give it up after her death? I also found it incredibly tragic that Andrew died just months before Razi was able to connect the dots and find out where he was. In that element, I was unsatisfied with the conclusion. Her sudden realization that Andrew was always with her was true, yes, but did he know that? Maybe I'm just a sucker for neatly finished endings, but I would have liked it if they were somehow able to communicate before they both moved on."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1292669-ann", "userReview": "Two stories are intertwined in this story, told from the point of view of a woman who died in 1929 and has remained \"in between\" because she is not ready to go on to the other (unspecified) life after death. Razi is a fascinating protagonist and her life illustrates the flapper age when bobbing one's hair gave freedom, but birth control and female doctors were still controversial.Razi's story plays out against a semi-parallel story of a contemporary young couple who fascinate Razi, so the reader gets two stories, two worlds that ultimately come together with some hard-stretched plot connections.The writing is beautiful, but I found the two-story construction artifical and would have preferred more on Razi's story. Sher was the character who came alive for me, much moreso than the modern-day Amy, with whom I never identified."}, {"userName": "Isa_correia", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4937731-isa-correia", "userReview": "Comprei este livro num impulso e depois nunca o tive vontade de ler...

In an instant, she leaves behind her one true love and her dream of becoming a doctor\u2014but somehow, she still remains. Immediately after her death, Razi chooses to stay between\u2014a realm that exists after life and before whatever lies beyond it.From this remarkable vantage point, Razi narrates the stories of her lost love, Andrew, and the relationship of Amy and Scott, a couple whose house she haunts almost seventy-five years later. The Mercy of Thin Air entwines these two fateful and redemptive love stories that echo across three generations. From ambitious, forward-thinking Razi, who illegally slips birth control guides into library books; to hip Web designer Amy, who begins to fall off the edge of grief; to Eugenia, caught between since the Civil War, the characters in this wondrous novel sing with life. Evoking the power of love, memory, and time, The Mercy of Thin Air culminates in a startling finish that will leave readers breathless.", "title": "The Mercy of Thin Air", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18603.The_Mercy_of_Thin_Air", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1411349890l/18603.jpg", "reviews": 693, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11195.Ronlyn_Domingue", "name": "Ronlyn Domingue"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Romance", "Paranormal", "Fantasy"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18603.The_Mercy_of_Thin_Air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/340396.The_Mercy_of_Thin_Air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8419509-the-mercy-of-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1477862.The_Mercy_Of_Thin_Air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6871841-a-paix-o-das-almas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15802506-the-mapmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18144060-the-chronicle-of-secret-riven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32919532-the-plague-diaries", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38531320-the-plague-diaries", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13615544-the-beautiful-anthology", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
