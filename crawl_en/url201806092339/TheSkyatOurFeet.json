Jason's life is harrowing to read about, to say the least. He's a child who's not only facing being separated from his beloved mother due to her illegal immigrant status, but also going on an adventure with a girl his age, Max, who's pretty secretive about her own medical condition but who loves life and wants to help her new friend on his journey.We live in a time of confusion, conflict and burning accusations, a time where everything out of the ordinary is suspicious. Hashimi chooses to focus less on the more adult themes that could have gone into this book and instead looks at what kind of impact deportation, family dysfunction and the fear of Muslims in America has on a child. All Jason knows is that his father was killed and his mother may be sent away forever. How's a kid to cope with that? Amidst the beautiful backdrop of the Big Apple, The Sky at Our Feet is a wonderful story that I'd recommend to anyone."}, {"userName": "Richie Partington", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1737220-richie-partington", "userReview": "Richie\u2019s Picks: THE SKY AT OUR FEET by Nadia Hashimi, HarperCollins, March 2018, 304p., ISBN: 978-0-06-242193-7\u201cThat very night in Max\u2019s room a forest grewand grew--and grew until his ceiling hung with vinesand the walls became the world all around\u201d--Maurice Sendak, from Where the Wild Things Are, as painted on an outdoor stairway at the Central Park Zoo\u201c\u2018I fall behind in school,\u2019 my mom explains, continuing the story. \u2018They sent me letters. I tried to explain I need time. You were so small and still in the hospital. Then I got one letter that says I cannot be in this country. The letter tells me I have to leave, but how can I go? My baby is in the hospital and your father\u2019s grave is not yet covered in grass. And the people who called our families, they were still calling. They are angry because your father\u2019s face was on the front of the newspaper and many people loved him. The bad people, they promise that the country will never be safe for his family.\u2019So she stayed in America.But with my father dead, what were the chances that they would give his family a visa? Who could she ask without risking being sent back to Afghanistan?At any point, she could be found. At any point, she could be arrested. She had an expired passport and an expired student visa. That meant that if the authorities found her, they would send her back to Afghanistan. Knowing what happened to my father and the terrible words the people said, she had to make an impossible choice.\u201dTwelve year-old Jason D. Riazi is a American citizen, with an Americanized name, living in New Jersey. He was born here. As a premie, he began life with an extended stay in the hospital. But his Afghan mother doesn\u2019t have the blessing of American citizenship. She\u2019d just arrived in America on that student visa when she learned she was pregnant. Jason\u2019s father, an Afghan who was working as a translator for the American forces in Afghanistan, had successfully secured his wife\u2019s student visa shortly before he was murdered.All these years later, it\u2019s only a matter of weeks after Jason\u2019s mom explains to him that she\u2019s been in the country illegally, that Jason sees his mother being handcuffed at work and dragged away. He\u2019s sure she\u2019s going to be deported to Afghanistan. Jason runs home to their little apartment just long enough to grab a change of clothes and some parental photographs before heading toward Manhattan where \u201cAuntie\u201d Seema, his mother\u2019s best friend in America, has recently moved. But short of sustenance, Jason passes out in Penn Station, sustains a concussion when he falls, and ends up in the pediatric ward of a Manhattan hospital. That\u2019s where he meets Max, a girl his age who is pretty cagey about why her head\u2019s all wired up to electrodes, and why she\u2019s as determined as him to escape the hospital.There is as much of a joy vibe, as there is tension, when the duo successfully breaks out of the ward and heads to the Central Park Zoo--Max\u2019s wish fulfillment--on the way to tracking down the apartment where Jason\u2019s \u201cauntie\u201d lives.What will happen to Jason D., his mom, and to Max?There has always been a push among some Americans, no matter how recently their own forebears arrived, to exclude others from having the same opportunities to escape dangerous or miserable countries and come to America. \u201cDo these strangers belong here?\u201d is a question that divides those of us who are mindful that our own forebears were despised foreigners not all that that long ago from other Americans whose memories are shorter and whose hearts aren\u2019t so generous.Author Nadia Hashimi, M.D. has woven her own background as a first-generation Afghan-American with aspects of her work as a pediatric doctor to craft a tale that is exciting, heartstopping, topical, and realistic. And joyful. While hinting at the fearful political situation that plagues immigrants in today\u2019s America, she delivers a tale that\u2019s filled with great riddles and actually has a happy ending.

One day, his mother tells him that while he was born in the US and is an American citizen, she came to the US on a student visa while Jason's father remained, working as a translator for the US military. After he was killed, she struggled to raise him and has never applied for asylum, even though her friend Seema keeps telling her to. Not long after, his mother is picked up by the police at her place of work, and Jason panics. He grabs a back pack and a few granola bars, and starts off for his Aunt Seema's apartment in New York City. The venture does not start off well-- he loses his backpack and later passes out, hitting his head and ending up in the hospital. He pretends to have amnesia, so buys himself a little time. He meets Max, and girl who is vague about why she is in the hospital, and the two decide to break out and get to Seema's. They do manage to get out, and make their way across the city. Max really wants to see the zoo, and the children manage to get in. Max's medical problems catch up with her, however, but she tells Jason to go on without her. He has several adventures of his own and eventually makes it to Seema's. The big question still remains, however; what will happen to his mother, and to him if she is returned to Afghanistan?Strengths: The issues of Jason's mother's immigration challenges are related in a realistic, sympathetic, and understandable way. Jason's love for his mother and his Afghan culture are very sweet. The adventure in New York City is what will sell this to children, especially since Jason even has a brush with celebrity. This put me in mind of From the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler in the best possible way. Weaknesses: While I would have adored reading the adventure in this when I was 12, just about every decision that Jason makes appalls me as an adult. I also was alarmed by how little planning Jason's mother had done. As a single parent, it seems that she would have had an emergency plan for Jason even if she hadn't had the additional worry of immigration on her mind. Also, I would have liked a bit more detail about Jason's every day life before his mother's detainment. What I really think: Definitely purchasing. This is a great mix of adventure and very realistic problems, told from an #ownvoices perspective."}, {"userName": "Simran", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60006584-simran", "userReview": "The Sky At Our Feet is a story about a young boy Jason D, and his mother who had fled Afghanistan after his father's death and now are living in America as immigrants. Written from Jason's point of view its about his adventures or should I say misadventures when he finds out that his mum is can be sent to Afghanistan by the immigration officers and police. The story is about a delicate yet very poignant issue and gives the readers a peek into the lives of immigrants to gain a better perspective over it. I really liked the parts where Jason's Mom started telling him more details about his father and how she gave him an American name so nobody would think he's different. But the story be assured, is about more than immigration. There is a very important helping side character Max who adds to the spunk to the story and takes off the tension and gives you a good laugh. I really liked Max, there's something really likable about her character. By the middle of it I was really rooting for them both and I just wanted Jason to reach the destination, but twists kept coming in the way. All in all it was a wonderful read, a bit emotional but not in a heavy way kind of enjoyable read, the context of story is about friendship, family and conflict about oneself and their identity. I liked that Hashimi did'nt focus more on the heavy difficult overbearing details but kept it real and straighforward. :)"}, {"userName": "Katrina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10492164-katrina", "userReview": "A lovely romp around exciting New York City as a young Afghan-American boy relies on his wits, being brave and trusting others to help find help for his Mum. Ever fearful of being deported for being an illegal immigrant, Jason's Mum's worst fears are realised one morning when she is taken away from her workplace, the local laudromat, in a police car. Jason can only look on in despair but he soons hatches a plan to get help and seek out his beloved Auntie Seema, a close friend who has always been there for his mother and Jason offering friendship and support when they most needed it. He has never visited her before as she always came to their house but he has seen a photo of her home and he rips her return address from postage she has sent them and he rummages around for some loose change in the house and some snacks for his tummy.Jason is really not sure he will be successful in his quest but he can't just do nothing. I must be brave and give it a go despite my fear. When a nasty dog snaps his backpack away from him at the outset, with most of his supplies inside it, it seems his quest is already destined for failure. But Jason urges himself to be brave and give it go. Knocks on the head, a chance meeting in a hospital with a young girl called Max who's head is all wired to a machine and then a brave escape with her for freedom to continue Jason's search for Auntie Seema unlocks an exciting but fearful adventure as both escapees attempt to outwit adults - caring nurses, doctors, and police officers - as they navigate immense New York City. They must solve the puzzle of the street grid numbering system, seek out faster ways to get around the city, avoid those - possibly the whole city's occupants - who are looking for 2 young children without adults and have a bit of fun at the same time. What could be better than a side excursion to Central Park Zoo? And then Max, this super-intelligent young girl, who has joined Jason in his quest to find Auntie Seema reveals her real reason for escaping with Jason. The freedom to escape for just a day, to try and forget her own worries spurs her on to help another person but will her health issues intervene as they have so often done in the past? Will Jason be able to help Max the way she is helping him when she most needs it? One might not feel brave all the time but sometimes overcoming the smallest hurdles become the bravest acts of all.When Max's circumstances force her to leave Jason's quest to find his Auntie Seemie will Jason have the strength to carry on? How will Max's act of bravery spur him on and will there be other people he meets on the way that will also offer him the hope and support he needs to carry on his quest. Evading Officer Khan is proving more and more difficult?This is a beautiful, reflective story about displaced people - illegal refugees, reviled war veterans, normal people with medical conditions - who are trying to find understanding and tolerance from others. It is too easy to judge those who's story we do not know. It is too easy to judge those for their wrong actions that, once the circumstances are known, might be better understood. Most people are good, sometimes we make the wrong decisions, but put yourself into the lives of Jason, his mother, Max, and many of the other characters in this book and perhaps there would be more compassion and tolerance in the world today. A very insightful book into the plight of refugees and those living with medical conditions and the role of people in authority genuinely committed to helping their fellowman to live safely and happily.

Jason D learned a month ago that his mother is an \u2018illegal alien\u2019 in the US. Then he sees her taken from her job and put into the back of a car by two uniformed men. Suddenly, he's alone. No longer able to enjoy his mother\u2019s care and comfort, Jason must face many harsh realities in his run across New York City to find his Aunt Seema. She is the only other person in the US Jason feels he can turn to for help. Focused and determined, nothing will get in his way...Except a concussion, hospital stay, the subway system, hunger, fear, and and no working knowledge of NYC. But memories of his mother keep him moving. He meets an accomplice, Max, whose own determination inspires Jason D to keep searching for home. This book was not what I expected, and that's wonderful! Given the premise, I thought it would be a tale of despair. Given that deportation is a current issue tearing families apart, I was ready for a fruitless search. The Sky At Our Feet isn't that. With strong themes of bravery and home, it sings. Jason D is always looking back to his mom\u2019s loving guidance (and riddles-lots of riddles!) in order to move forward. In his search he runs through many hypothetical plans; the uncertainty is realistic and eye-opening. Ultimately, The Sky At Our Feet is an adventure with higher stakes than your \u2018typcial\u2019 middle grade book. But it's the world we live in, and it's what schoolchildren today are being forced to think about. Sadly necessary, this book is good for anyone in a similar situation to Jason, but maybe even more so to those who are not."}, {"userName": "Gayle Cappelluti", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35279346-gayle-cappelluti", "userReview": "Dr. Hashimi has done it again by writing a book that is informative and enlightening but also engaging, suspenseful, and very current. This time she writes of Jason D ., a young American Afghan boy who learns that his mom has been keeping a secret, a scary secret that could destroy their American dream. While watching a broadcast on TV that shows illegal aliens, his mother explains to him that after his father was killed in Afghanistan while working as a translator for American soldiers, she realized that Afghanistan was far too dangerous a place for her and her son, then, as yet unborn, and decided she had to remain in this country no matter what, even after her student visa expired. Like the poor people portrayed on TV, Jason\u2019s mom was also illegal.Needless to say, when Jason comes to the laundromat where his mom works soon after, and sees two uniformed men putting her into the back of their car, he freezes. Should he run to her? Should he hide? Could he make it on his own from his NewJersey home to his aunt Seema in New York City? What should he do? What would you do?I won\u2019t ruin this exciting hero tale by giving any of it away. Let it suffice to say this is an adventure that is at once captivating, entertaining, and spell binding. Some of Jason \u2018s adventure is a bit out there, but it is a story for the young reader, so I can\u2019t fault it.

I love his friendship with Max and don't think Jason would be as strong as he is if it wasn't for her. The ending was perfect, but I'm not going to give away any spoilers.Final Verdict: This story is perfect for middle graders being taught the differences between people.

I am so happy to encounter a middle grade novel centering the experience of a child of an immigrant from Afghanistan whose mother faces the same dangers that the families of real Afghan interpreters for the U.S. military face in their home country today. Though The Sky At Our Feet helps the reader walk a mile in the shoes of a an American child whose mother overstayed her visa illegally, it doesn't clobber the reader over the head with the politics involved in deportation of good, decent parents of American children. It simply lets us get to know Jason and appreciate the development of his character as he reels from the possible deportation of his beloved mother. Developing empathy for Jason and his mother, and for all the real Jasons and their mothers and fathers, will be great for any young reader of this book.Sashimi's professional expertise as a pediatrician lent sensitive detail to her portrayal of Max, whose courage and pluck in facing her illness led to interesting plot developments.

With that said, I enjoyed reading the book. The characters are well developed and very likable, and I particularly enjoyed the friendship between the main characters Jason and Max. I'd recommend this book for kids ages 10-13. It introduces kids to the human realities of illegal immigration in the US in an enjoyable and easy understood way.*my one tiny complaint is that the book ends with everything wrapped up all easy, when this is not the reality for most illegal immigrants in the US when they have any interaction at all with ICE. This book takes on the subject, but then somehow completely fails to bring detention centers into the story (not to mention long holding times, confusing and little understood legal trials, expulsions, etc.).

Being a New Yorker, I really loved how Hashimi weaves NYC through the book - the setting is truly another character.

Their adventures in one day fill most of the book.This is middle-grade fiction so it wraps up neatly with everyone's lives being better.Not as compelling as other works from this author but middle grades will relate to the characters."}, {"userName": "Darla", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8338960-darla", "userReview": "Thank you to Harper Collins and Edelweiss for an ARC of this middle grade book.It was quite an adventure story. It begins on the day when Jason sees his mother picked up from her job at the laundromat because she does not have American citizenship. He decides to go find his \"Aunt\" in NYC, but only knows what street she lives on. The story takes lots of twists and turns as Jason makes his way to NYC, ends up in the hospital, and escapes with a girl named Max. There are lots of opportunities for kids to gain empathy for families from other countries as well as other kids with illnesses like epilepsy. The action moves quickly and would make it a good book for both boys and girls."}, {"userName": "Shoshana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7776500-shoshana", "userReview": "While I didn't find this as fully engaging and enveloping as \"One Half from the East,\" I did enjoy it - Jason's voice is distinct and strong, and it manages to be a book about a serious topic without being about the serious topic. Jason's adventure through New York is fun and suspenseful, even though it's in a scary context. Even moreso, I think the Issue (immigration, particularly illegal immigration) is so well addressed, so well built into the story - it IS the story, but this never feels like it's trying to beat the reader about the head with the point. I was very impressed with how Hashimi made the subject accessible and relateable for children."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/743109-lisa", "userReview": "I wasn't expecting this to be a middle grade book, as the other two I have read by this author were both for adults.
