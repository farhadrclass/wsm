Because of the continuous thrust of the rocket, there is gravity on board.The passengers, a mixed group ,a movie star,science commentator ,musician ,astronaut, the first to land on Mercury and even a lowly writer.The five celebrities, are ironically not as well known as the sixth Floyd,who doesn't consider himself one anymore.Dr.Floyd calls Universe a \"Ship of Fools\".Captain Smith has his hands full trying to control these egomaniacs. Oh,and some men of science are around too.The touchdown on Halley's is surprisingly dull,just the way the captain likes it.This dirty snowball, has a few interesting things to see.Geysers,that shoot out water,which quickly turns to vapor and ice and goes out into endless space , never to return.Natural structures that look unnatural.Caves are found and the scientists, of course, need to explore them.The real reason for this voyage, knowledge, the naive men believe.A strange light at the end of a cavern is spotted but a message has been received, an emergency.They have to leave this colorless but novel place immediately. Their sister spaceship,Galaxy, crashed landed on cloud covered Europa, a former moon of Jupiter,which aliens have turned into a second Sun,Lucifer. A Forbidden World, that no one for fifty years,has had the courage to visit.With weird Mount Zeus towering miles high above the surface of the satellite.And also an ocean, formed there, with giant sea creatures,below,the Galaxy floating on top. Nearby enormous Jupiter/Lucifer,warms the sphere, as strange a place, as exists in the whole Solar System.Something doesn't make sense about the accident.The rescue ship Universe, will demand a thorough investigation. But how will the aliens react? By the way, Dr.Floyd's estranged grandson, is on board the Galaxy."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31814285-daniel", "userReview": "Jos jedna ineresantna knjiga prepuna originalnih ideja i lepih scena (citav deo oko Halejeve komete je izvrstan) ali sve ukupno ipak ostavlja daleko slabiji utisak nego prethodne dve.

Mankind has build bases on the moon and Ganymede (where a scientist makes an astonishing discovery about Europa) and advances in science have made interplanetary space travel economical feasible, which paved the way for private enterprises. One of them is Tsung Spacelines where Chris Floyd, grandson of Heywood Floyd, works on one of their space ships (named \"Galaxy\"). Tsung Spacelines has finished building another ship (named \"Universe\") and invited several celebrities, among them Heywood Floyd, to the maiden flight which includes a stop-over at Halley's comet. But things take a turn for the worse when the Galaxy is hijacked and crash-lands on Europa...my thoughts: I felt a bit disappointed since the story dealt only marginally with the mystery of the Black Monoliths and their builders and the overall story-arc doesn't get advanced that much.That out of the way we get some typical Clarke: enthusiastic and optimistic about space exploration, the science as always accurate. The characters are more varied than usual, instead only a crew of capable scientients and officers we get some colourful civilians on a pleasure cruise thrown into the mix.But all that (including the plot sometimes) takes a backseat to Clarke's imaginative descriptions of some places in our solar system: Ganymede, Europa, Halley's comet and some developing lifeforms are brought vividly to life.Add some funny musings about the problems on the more mundane aspects of future space travel (e.g. you can get an insurance policy from Lloyds but is hijacking covered?) and you have a good and actual believable book on the exploration of space.my advice: can be read stand-alone (Clarke dedicates a couple of pages at the beginning of the book to get the reader up to speed) but it's better to start with \"2001\""}, {"userName": "Perry Whitford", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5485442-perry-whitford", "userReview": "2061 may seem like a random date in which to continue the Space Odyssey story into a third book, but there is a very good reason for it - the return of Halley's Comet.Amazingly Dr Heywood Floyd, middle-aged in the first two books, is still going strong aged one hundred and three, thanks to half a lifetime spent in low gravity, orbiting Earth in a space hospital after a bad fall. His grand-son is also an astronaut and they are about to meet up after a space-jacking in the Jovian system as all eyes are again turned to Europa, the moon that the makers of the monoliths had warned the people of Earth to leave alone.I really enjoyed Odyssey Two, which Clarke never thought he would write and which came a long time after 2001. Despite the delay, the plot was superb, the ending spectacular and the overall scope of the story was enhanced.This third part, however, which came soon after the second, is a pretty feeble effort, adding little to the legacy. The plot is a flimsy, tensionless affair, the resolution wholly underwhelming.The inclusion of a landing on Halley's Comet is interesting enough in itself I suppose, but it has nothing to do with the wider narrative. Worse yet, whole portions are simply lifted verbatim from the previous book!

It also felt confusing, and the characters don't come alive very well. Clarke has two plots going at the same time and the effect (of going between the two ships) is confusing. There isn't much of a plot and nothing of very much interest happens. (Even the hi-jacking feels cheesy.) Having said that, Clarke is more of a scientist than a writer and what captivates me is the astronomy, the science, the feeling of space travel and descriptions of outer space as well as future technology some of which has come to pass that he had predicted in 1987, such as the internet and social media. Here is Floyd observing a fellow passenger : \"He found it both sad and fascinating that only through an artificial universe of video images could she establish contact with the real world.\" What a prediction for our time! Clarke sprinkles his knowledge (sometimes even insider knowledge), his scientific expertise and his humor into this minor story as part of the Odyssey series. But the plot limps along and then doesn't really go anywhere. He has lost the wonder and majesty of 2001: A Space Odyssey. Perhaps he answered too many questions, and the answers are actually dull. Once he lost the mystery, this story became merely second-rate science fiction.

According to the first two books, this was supposed to be a really bad deal.So I kept waiting for the ship to be destroyed or the people to get eaten by the previously malevolent Europans......but nothing happens. The hijacking plan is never explained and no one is ever held responsible. The celebrities were worthless. We don't even get to hear about the actual rescue. Dr Floyd doesn't hook up with the actress celebrity (which at his age probably would have killed him, but still---why spend all this time talking about how he was crushing on her and do nothing with that???). It's like Clarke got bored writing the book and and said \"The hell with it. Let's just wrap it up\". There were a lot of interesting directions this book could have gone, and unfortunately for me he really dropped the ball.

So can the following sequels still feel fresh and surprise? After the second book, which I did not feel gripped me as much (the film either), this next one again is similar. The writing style of Clarke is always a good crafted standard, but is dating now.

The year was chosen as that is when Halley\u2019s Comet will again be visible from Earth, and part of the story is concerned with a crew landing on the comet itself. As the book was written before the fall of apartheid, Clarke predicts a revolution in South Africa that results in much of the white population leaving the country, and the resulting politics play a role. Most of it, however, deals with the exploration of Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa. Heywood Floyd, now 103 years old, reappears as a major character, and ends up reuniting with Dave Bowman in energy form. Overall, though, the plot seemed a bit disjointed. There\u2019s a stewardess who tries to hijack the ship, but we never learn her motivations, and her name isn\u2019t even consistent.

However, when you know that 2061 is the year that Halley's Comet is next due to pass Earth it begins to make sense. Heywood Floyd is now a centurion but thanks to huge lengths of time in space has the body of a sixty year old. In 2061 he is invited on a trip aboard the Universe, a space tourism trip that will land on Halley's comet. Meanwhile his grandson Chris is aboard sister ship Galaxy and is headed for a fly-by of the not to be touched Jovian moon Europa. Things go very wrong though and the crew of the Galaxy find themselves stranded on the moon, hoping that the Universe can reach them for a rescue.All of the Odyssey books so far have seen a major space expedition as the main part of the book with a dramatic ending involving the monoliths and creepy super alien goings-on. This one really tones the latter part and focuses almost entirely on the humans in space aspect. It's the comet landing and the stranded on Europa parts that the story focuses on and as with all of Clarke's work they are very much based on fact. Whilst the idea of landing on Halley's Comet seems a little unlikely, at least at the next fly-past, the science of what is there is perfectly sound and the same can be said about Europa. This is a book about humans in space and it feels very possible. The ending does focus on the monolith side of things but unlike in the last book things are very small-scale, serving little point but to set up the next book. I expected to enjoy the book less because of the lack of the alien-side of things but like the original 2001 it was the space travel that I enjoyed most. For me, up to this point in the series, the monoliths serve as a plot to make stories of travel into space a novel. Reading this book makes me wish our space travel abilities were as advanced as in the odyssey universe, it brings the theoretical to dramatic real-life."}, {"userName": "Sudeep Agarwal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33648706-sudeep-agarwal", "userReview": "The book is good when read as the third installment to the space odyssey series.

David Bowman, the astronaut who had become pure energy-being, sends out a warning to Earth through the radio of Discovery, the abandoned ship in Jovian province, forbidding humans to land on Europa. David Bowman and the ship's artificial intelligence HAL, have integrated themselves into a single conscious form of energy and they are staying on Europa, protecting the Europan life-forms from foolish tinkering of Humans. Humans have made settlements on Space Stations orbitting around the Earth; and establishments are made on, now benign, Ganymede and Callisto as well.Heywood Floyd, the protagonist of previous books, is a centenary man who is not altogether frail because of living in outer space most of his life. In 2061, Halley's Comet returns and an expedition on a ship named Universe is sent out to rendezvous with it, and Floyd is chosen to be as a tourist accompanying the crew.They land on the nightside of Halley, exploring its surreal and enigmatic structure, testing the inky black hydrocarbons and examining the subterranean excavations carved out by unknown mechanisms. They observe that Halley spurts out jets of water in the form of vapour and ice, rising in vertical columns because of low gravity and lack of air drag.At this time, they hear the news that a ship has crash landed on Europa and got stranded on the forbidden satellite. Fearing the consequence of apparent violation of warning, a rescue mission is arranged and since the Universe is the only ship which can accomplish the mission, it gets off Halley and sets out for Europa.On the other side of the Solar System, a scientist of Ganymede had observed that a mountain of ten thousand metres in height has suddenly appeared on remarkably smooth surface of Europa. He analyses it spectrally and suspects that it could be a single diamond of that large a size. He relays his findings to an Earth scientist, who substantiates the hypothesis by consulting an 80 year old research journal from Nature. This information leaks out to Shaka, which is a gang of sociopaths consisting of African rebels.Here is one of the underdeveloped backdrops of the story which, if significantly worked upon, would have made the novel more interesting and intellectually satisfying. Clarke talks of a rebellion taking place in African continent where Blacks drive out the Whites, and form the alliance United States of South Africa. Whites take all the money out of the continent, practically demolishing African economy, but it is promptly rejuvenated by supply of diamonds from mines. Shaka belongs to one of the sinister facets of USSA. When they discover that a mountain-sized single diamond is found on Europa, they plan to hijack a ship named Galaxy which was employed for a reconaissance of Jovian satellites. Rose McCullen, a spy, is introduced into the crew who manages to force the Galaxy pilot to land on Europa but the landing attempt fails and she is killed. Later, they manage to take their hovering ship to a nearby ocean and plunge themselves in it. The ship keeps them alive and they begin exploring the land, while waiting for the rescue mission to retrieve them before the wrath of Bowman-Hal entity befalls them for supposedly violating the warning.The ship Universe reaches there and rescues them, while the diamond mountain sinks through the icy land of Europa and reaches to the core. Before being rescued off Europa, the scientists aboard Galaxy had discovered that the diamond was a part of the core of Jupiter which flew away during the implosion of the gas giant and hit Europa. They propound that millions of such fragments must have similarly been ejected and should be found in the orbit around Jupiter. They propose that a radar-search should be organized because Diamond is the only material capable of constructing the Space elevators for inexpensively travelling the interplanetary distances. Now, this concept is also left unclear by Author.In the conclusion, Clarke talks of pre-minisun times when the underground seas had analogues of geothermal vents where life flourished but soon flickered out due to instability of the lava eruptions. He talks of swift evolution on such oases due to rapidly changing circumstances, while blatantly ignoring or being unaware of the fact that Evolution is a process which can neither work too swiftly nor too slowly. Natural selection needs a significant time period to work upon selecting favourable mutations and making cumulative propagation.Despite some flaws and underdeveloped backdrops, it is a smooth read as compared to its predecessors. It is not sensational, thrilling or fear-inducing like his other works, but merely interesting and enchanting with description of Halley and Europa. It could be considered a book to be read in vacations."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8311987-david", "userReview": "It was simply \u2018okay.\u2019 I found the first two books in the series far more interesting."}, {"userName": "Helix", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57476518-helix", "userReview": "3,5 stars (Goodreads really need a half star rating).It was an enjoyable ride, and compared to the previous book, a walk in the park. Sir Arthur C Clarke's writing had been as captivating as when I first read A Space Odyssey, but I guess this book suffers from a rather severe case of technological advancement: since it's the future, and now everything is easier, some of the thrills (well, almost all of them) that made me love the previous novel so much (I think this series peaked at Odyssey Two) had been thrown out of the airlock. Odyssey Two claims that it is about the romance of space, and it delivers, with a witty, colourful, likeable cast of characters, and a thrilling, dangerous mission. Odyssey Three was child's play. Space only serves as a backdrop, now that humanity has invented better spaceships and has colonialized the inner Jovian satellites (sans Europa) and the Moon. I found it rather ironic.The characters aren't as likeable nor anywhere as fleshed-out as the cast of Leonov. Floyd is still his same old self, and Chris Floyd, Woody's grandson, might have been a likeable guy (and my fave), but there's too much characters floating around, so he doesn't really get that much attention. Concerning the crew (including the guests) of the Universe, and, by extension, its sister-ship Galaxy: alas, they really can't beat the Russians in the previous book. Sorry. They just aren't that fleshed-out, and I don't really grow attached to them.I'm also rather disappointed about some things, like the storyline. The Galaxy rescue mission was ostensibly being ex machina-ed (pretty much), despite it being framed like an important plot point. Bowman and Hal disappeared, despite them (and Floyd, but he has taken over the spotlight as the protagonist, so he doesn't count) being the connecting thread between this book and the previous books in the series, and only appearing (MINOR SPOILER) at the end. Just a little and easily forgettable cameo (if I remembered correctly) about the Europans despite them playing a rather vital importance in the grand narrative of the series ever since the previous book dropped that bomb. The narrative being pretty much everywhere but the places where it needed to be. Even the \"secret\" (van der Berg's discovery) turned out to be not even half as exciting as the ones in the previous books (or maybe it's just me, since I don't dig rocks that much, even precious ones--pun intended). On second thought, I don't think Odyssey Three suffers from technological advancement, it suffers from a highly inefficient and vague narrative. The plot is clear, it's just the storyline that's messy.Maybe it's unfair to compare Odyssey Three to its predecessor, but honestly, I can't help it. The second book sets the bar high and the first book is iconic, full of poetic imagery, but sadly, I don't think this one can live up to its siblings' shadows. I wonder if the next and final book would be better, and I certainly hope so. However, all criticisms aside, this isn't a terribly written book; on the contrary, at this point I think Clarke can't write anything bad. The writing is still as good as ever, I love the author's ideas and concepts and what he envisioned human beings would be like (sadly those on Ganymede are still ironically homophobic--wondered if that was intentional), I'm terribly jealous of Floyd (I, too, would love to \"accidentally\" wake up in the future in a space hospital, but not like, you know, Khan), and I definitely appreciate the humour, the science, and even the attempt on diversity (the racial diversity arguably kind of works, though we've had better gender diversity and better written female characters in Odyssey Two, but the LGBT diversity is still up for debate, although I do enjoy Floyd's really gay couple bestfriends back on the Moon, though they're a bit stereotypical), not to mention the pop culture references (we've had Star Wars here after Star Trek in the previous book, and some others, I think). It took me a long time to finish this because I procrastinate on stuff (and also because I'm applying for a Master's degree), not because Odyssey Three is badly written, god forbid.Anyway, this is getting long and I should be in bed, but I liked this, although there's definitely plenty of room for improvement and it's kind of bland compared to the previous two installments in the series. I'm still excited to read the finale, though."}, {"userName": "Steven  Wetter", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41127452-steven-wetter", "userReview": "A stretch of the imagination in the series, but always fun to read A.C.
