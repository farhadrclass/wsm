I blame this on \"Little House on the Prairie\" primarily, but it always seemed very exciting to live in a relatively unexplored world. Valerie Hansen is a good author and I've enjoyed some of her other books, but this one isn't her best. The plot centers on a wagon train heading to California during the heady days of the Gold Rush. The train's nefarious Captain, Ramsay Tucker, has plans for 16-year-old Charity Beal that involve stealing her inheritance. Her 19-year-old sister, Faith (I assume that there's a third sister, Hope, somewhere) has promised to see Charity safely to California to find their father following their mother's untimely death. Aiding Faith is mountain man Connell McClain, who is heading west to search for his missing fiancee, Irene. Connell blends in well as he was part of an Indian tribe for awhile and even married an Indian woman (who was killed during a raid). Hansen adds a nice touch of rivalry here, as Faith must deal with the fact that while she's attracted to Connell, he's engaged to Irene. As another reviewer pointed out, Irene and her Indian suitor are more interesting characters than Faith and Connell. Charity is simply an idiotic teenage girl who elicits no sympathy from the reader. It's a decent read, with a lot of details concerning life in the Old West and Indian tribal customs, but it's not a keeper.\""}, {"userName": "Sarah Evans", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1095807-sarah-evans", "userReview": "This is one where the cover and the tag line really don't match the content. It looks all peaceful with the placid word \"courtship\" in the title. There's not really time for courtship here with lots of attempted murder and a desperate race to reach California. But our hero and heroine fall for each other through their struggles, as it should be in this kind of book. The inspirational part is fairly low-key and flows as part of a settler's typical beliefs. My only complaint is something that occurs in other Harlequin novels I've read; the author writes in third person but switches character view point mid paragraph."}, {"userName": "Krissie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10867207-krissie", "userReview": "She had made a solemn promise to see her younger sister to safety in California.
