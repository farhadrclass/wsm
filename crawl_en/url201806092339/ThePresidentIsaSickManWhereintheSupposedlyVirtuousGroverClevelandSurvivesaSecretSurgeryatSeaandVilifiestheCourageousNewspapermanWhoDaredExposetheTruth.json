This is the best type in non fiction, one that mixes facts, humor and informational tidbits into a wonderfully readable book. I have always read, what seems to be the same Presidents over and over again, Lincoln, Roosevelt, Washington, Jackson, Adams and Jefferson so this year I have decided to branch out. With that in mind I picked this one up and am so glad I did.So many things I never knew, that the debate over the gold and silver standard almost resulted in another civil war. That this President had a reputation for his honesty, above all else, and yet had a secret cancer surgery aboard a yacht and kept it all secret from the public and his vice-president. A newsman who uncovered the story from a loose tongued doctor, had his reputation nearly ruined. The two huge hurricane's that hit the East Coast, one destroying Coney Island and many other houses, the other devastating the Gullahs, Sea Island, where many of them perished. So much more, and a little trivia and humor as well.Felt I received a non partisan look at a time and a man that turned out to be the only President to serve two non-consecutive terms. Sometimes I think the US prospers, not because of their leaders but in spite of them.I would recommend this book to any lover of history."}, {"userName": "Mara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1923002-mara", "userReview": "19th century presidents, they're just like us! Ok, so maybe that's not exactly true, but The President Is a Sick Man tells a story of aggressive \"journalists\" (who, if it weren't for the whole needing subjects to sit still for minutes on end, would definitely have been paparazzi), celebrities avoiding the limelight, financial crises, media coverups and pretty much the gamut of affairs that, today, are covered in US Weekly and Politico.Author Matthew Algeo may have been overstating his case when he referred to it as a \u201cbrazen political cover-up that was as diabolical as\u2014and infinitely more successful than\u2014Watergate.\u201d Nonetheless, a secret surgery done on the head of state on a boat no less, definitely makes for an interesting tale. Algeo spices it up with elements of the history of journalism and paper wars, modern takes on olden-timey medicine, tidbits of trivia (e.g. trends in facial hair in the oval office), and \u201cThe rumor mill\u2014one of the few thriving industries left in the country\u2014[which] resumed full-scale production.\u201dPoints of interest and such:I could care less about age gaps in relationships between consenting adults. However, Cleveland and Frances\u2019 history together made theirs a union that was uniquely creepy (well, maybe not uniquely- shoutout to Woody Allen and Soon Yi). I\u2019ll elaborate:1. When Cleveland\u2019s BFF, Folsom\u2019s, wife gave birth to their first daughter \u201cCleveland...bought her a baby carriage and doted on her as if she were his own.\u201d2. When Folsom met his early demise, \u201cCleveland was named the executor of Folsom\u2019s estate, and he came to feel a special obligation to Folsom\u2019s widow and her eleven-year-old daughter Frances.\u201d3. He had practically been her guardian after her father was killed in a carriage accident. He had bought her a puppy when she was a little girl, and she\u2019d called him Uncle Cleve.4. Here\u2019s the real kicker. When encouraged by his family to settle-down around this same time \u201cHe told his sisters, rather cryptically, \u2018I\u2019m only waiting for my wife to grow up.\u2019\u201dThe parts of the book focusing on the history of medicine and to the social stigma surrounding cancer (aka \u201cthe dread disease\u201d) were fascinating for this science studies aficionado.Much like AIDS a century later, the stigma attached to cancer was so deep and profound that people who had it were embarrassed or afraid to admit it.While it was uncouth to discuss the big C in polite company, this didn\u2019t stop people from profiteering with purported remedies.Folk remedies abounded as well. One called for the hand of a dead man to be placed on the tumor. Another prescribed the head of a puppy, dried and powdered and mixed with honey, to be applied to the growth.Given his invocation of the social stigma parallels between AIDS in the 80s and early 90s and cancer in Cleveland\u2019s era, I found it difficult to see the cover up as being as dastardly as Algeo portrayed it. (Has he seen Philadelphia?) The financial climate (which was pretty dire) made the potential consequences of public panic very real:Cleveland was not being vain. It was widely believed that his health and the nation\u2019s health were inextricably linked. Thus, I was disinclined to jump on Algeo\u2019s journalists rule, politicians drool bandwagon. Archer reference, because I just can\u2019t help myself:\"Grover Cleveland called. He wants his watch back. He left two non-consecutive messages.\""}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2534237-carol", "userReview": "\"Still, even in 1893, it was rather unusual for the president to go missing.\"\nI'm breaking my own rule (5 stars only for a book I plan to re-read) but I found this book so appealing that I couldn't be stingy with 4 stars. Why did I love it? He transported me to the last decade of the nineteenth century. The only other author who opened up this time period to me is Barbara Tuchman in The Proud Tower. Algeo's sense of humor suffuses the pages. The central focus of the book is the secret operation to remove oral cancer from President Cleveland's mouth, the prevarications proclaimed to deny it happened, and the distant relative of Jonathan Edwards who broke the story in a Philadelphia newspaper. Algeo takes two-page excursions on bypaths. Thoroughly delightful! It might be General Grant, the changing fashion of facial hair, Dr. Josef Lister\u2014a Scottish surgeon who changed the landscape of antiseptic surgery\u2014, or the possibility L. Frank Baum's Wizard of Oz is a parable on the struggle between Silver and Gold as the standard of the money supply.I'm grateful to have a clearer idea of who Grover Cleveland was besides that he was the only president to serve two nonconsecutive terms. He got a reputation for honesty when he responded with the truth to claims that he had fathered a child out of wedlock. I also enjoyed learning about Dr. William Keen, the premier surgeon of the day.Just for fun, here is a list from the 1870 Yale yearbook on the student's facial hair:Moustache, 26Sides, 19Down (quite down), 18Moustache and sides, 13Hopeful scrags, 12Incipient hairs, 9Moustache and imperial, 6Shave daily with no result, 3Moustache and whiskers, 3Fuzzy in spots, 2Feels confident that the soil is good, 1Is applying blisters, 1 If you enjoy popular history, I'd highly recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/909198-mary", "userReview": "With all the media focus on the presidential candidates' health, it seemed an appropriate time to read this book. I love reading about science and medicine. So reading about this secret operation on President Cleveland and 19th century medicine was a pleasure. Without a doubt, the health of the president can have a major impact on the world economy, foreign relations, and mood of the country. Mr. Edwards, the newspaper writer who broke this story, reported it without sensationalism and just offering a reasoned account of the facts. He did not deserve the trashing of his reputation that followed. Was the cover up necessary? Yes probably because of all the panic that would have followed the truth given the deep fear of cancer.

Don\u2019t know how it\u2019s evolved into this or that I agree with these current practices. I always go back to FDR with his polio, how he would be shown standing at a podium on his own two legs (albeit with much hidden support), and the media respectfully agreeing to never photograph him in a wheelchair or struggling in any way. Thanks to the media, who loved FDR, the public at large was ignorant of the extent of his malady. But before FDR, they were not always so respectful if they didn\u2019t like the President.Here we have Grover Cleveland, who is popular in games of trivia because there are many interesting and unique factoids about him. Grover is discovered to have a cancer at the roof of his mouth, and this is back when no one even liked to think about the C word, much less say it out loud. It\u2019s also not long after cancer ravaged poor old U.S. Grant, and everyone saw it. So when a reigning Prez gets seriously ill, do you really want to risk pandemonium and the political and economic repercussions by making it public knowledge? Or do you let just a few select people know about it and toss out a pack of lies to the public? The doctors and the administration opt to keep it a secret, except that one doctor spills the beans after feeling slighted, and, oh, what a sticky web they have created. This is about midway into the book and the damage control kicks into high gear, but the book sort of went the opposite direction for me after that point.Still a very good piece of non-fiction if you\u2019d like to learn more about our Presidents or if you ever wonder about the public\u2019s \u201cright to know.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Al Young", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24438263-al-young", "userReview": "I was really impressed with the first book I read by Algeo (Pedestrianism) and wanted to see how he would handle another favorite topic of mine besides sports, which is history and politics.I couldn't find Algeo at my BigBox local store so off to Amazon I went. Algeo seems to have a knack like Sarah Vowell to find some obscure but very interesting stories hidden deep in the past (though Algeo, doesn't put his political beliefs on his sleeve like Vowell does. PiaSM is largely non-partisan).History books tend to skip the period from Civil War to at least Teddy Roosevelt, if not to World War 1. There are a series of Presidents, mostly Republican, mostly one term, mostly bearded, and mostly from Ohio. One suspects if there is any story to tell, it would be in Grover Cleveland, the guy who shows up twice on those free Presidential rulers your teacher or bank gave you.The truth is the Executive Branch was not particularly powerful in those years, which is reflected in some of the Men who held it not seeming to be particularly interested in staying in office.The other part is that the major issue of the day was the currency issue, and the whole gold vs silver debate is confusing. Although this contradicts what I just said about History books above, I have actually been reading a lot of books focused on the late 19th Century. Credit to Algeo for probably the best description of both sides of that debate I have read, and why people felt strongly either for a Silver or Gold Standard.Cleveland is an interesting character and a stronger leader than some of his predecessors. He is very Conservative and would do well today with those against government \"handouts\". The book revolves around a story of the time in which Cleveland discovers a tumor in his mouth, and improbably, keeps it hidden by having it removed during what appears to outsiders as a boating trip.Because of the subject matter, we get background on 19th century medicine, surgery, dentistry, and anesthesia, as well as the politics of the day. All fascinating material for history buffs.President Grant had died of cancer, and there was an extreme stigma around it, so it would have rocked the Nation if it had been let out. Similarly, the balance of Gold supporters and Silverites was within a few votes. Even in Cleveland's party were the supporters of William Jennings Bryan, and Cleveland's Vice President (the first Adlai Stevenson) was sympathetic. The Panic of 1893 (the country's worst financial crisis besides the Great Depression) makes things shaky as it is.So, it is a cover up, and things go well. Things go well with the surgery- which is even amazing by today's standards- and things go well with the cover up. There are plenty of distractions like the birth of Cleveland's daughter, plus also an attitude in the press not to rock the boat so to speak.Meanwhile, a journalist named EJ Edwards finds the truth out and publishes it. He's vilified for it for many years, and the public believe the \"always honest\" Cleveland.It makes for a very interesting story. It also brings to mind questions which I don't know the answer to. Is it better or worse for the public to know? If the public knew the real situation, it indeed may have made the economy worse, and given that Cleveland survived, would have been an unnecessary scare. Yet, we value the truth over all else, right?A really interesting book for all of the reasons above, and well recommended for history buffs who will be well engrossed into it."}, {"userName": "Andi Marquette", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6642965-andi-marquette", "userReview": "I loved this book. Algeo is a fabulous writer, and he tells a story so smoothly that you're pulled along scarcely noticing the pages turning beneath your fingertips. I've been reading a lot of books that deal with the late 19th and early 20th centuries because I think in some key ways, the political, social, and economic climates we're experiencing now are mimicking those of that time period.Here, Algeo takes us into the life of President Cleveland and a surgery he arranged secretly to remove a tumor from his mouth. Had the public known of this, no doubt there would have been some serious media freak-out that most likely would have stirred doubt about Cleveland's abilities to govern and as the country was in the midst of one of the worst economic depressions in history, Cleveland needed to present a healthy constitution to keep the spirits of the American people up. Algeo captures the mood perfectly, and plops us right down into the 19th century.So not only is this a book about American politics, it's also a medical history because surgery in the late 19th century was a gambler's bet, but the team Cleveland assembled gives the reader insight to medicine and procedures of the time. Fascinating stuff.One intrepid reporter, however, figured out what Cleveland was up to. However, when he broke the story, the president and his posse refuted it completely, and basically ruined the reputation of the reporter. Ironically, the \"honest president\" kept the secret about his surgery. Read this book and find out how it all went down.

I had only heard of the story about President Cleveland's surgery a few years ago on a television show. When this book became available I could not wait to read more on the issue, though college kept me from getting through it as soon as I would have liked. Up until that previously mentioned TV show I did not know that one of our Presidents had a cancerous growth removed from his mouth, and did everything he could to hide it, including completely ruining the journalist who found out about it and tried to report on it. I really enjoyed reading about a president that I really did not know much about and how his actual personality compared to how he was portrayed to the public. The book is also a good illustration on how journalists tried not to step on the toes of those in power, prior to the 1960's in America.

I wasn't feeling terribly social while I was there, so I did quite a bit of reading during the breaks and the lunch hour (it helped that the book was really good). Over the course of the week, I had no fewer than six people come up to me and tell me they had heard about this book and wanted to know how it was.My first thought upon hearing this sentiment was, \"Why on earth have you heard about this book?\" It's about Grover Cleveland getting a tumor removed from his jaw and then hiding it from the American people. I'VE barely heard of this book. I don't even remember what compelled me to add it to my to-read list. The whole thing was mystifying.And that's when I realized (and quickly confirmed): PEOPLE THOUGHT THIS BOOK WAS ABOUT TRUMP. It's the title: The President is a Sick Man. Apparently people thought it was a book on the mental state of our current President.It's not. But I'd argue you'll enjoy this one much more.I'm always a little wary of books like this, that find some historical nugget that is maybe worth a New Yorker article that they then stretch into a book with a lot of unnecessary padding. This has always been one of Tom's standard complaints and apparently I've adopted it too. Well, I'm pleased to say that The President is a Sick Man more or less totally sidesteps this common pitfall. Yes, there are some tangents, but they all tie directly back into the story that Matthew Algeo is trying to tell. A chapter about late 19th century attitudes towards cancer (a death sentence that was considered taboo to discuss) ties directly into the larger narrative, which is President Grover Cleveland choosing to lie to his Cabinet and the public about his health and whereabouts and sneak off to a yacht on Long Island Sound to have a tumor in his jaw removed. Similarly, Algeo also knits in chapters on the economy during President Cleveland's administration (in the midst of a panic, which he didn't want to exacerbate with his poor health news) and how other presidents have treated health problems while in office.This story is a fascinating little bit of history, and I got to learn about an era I don't know much about. I was also terribly glad to be introduced to Grover Cleveland, who came across as one of the most all-around decent* individuals to ever hold the office. As a bonus, it's also accessibly written and I found the pages just flew. Here's the wildest part though: the tumor and accompanying one-third of Cleveland's jaw that was also removed are still around! They are in the M\u00fctter Museum, a medical museum in Philly that I've been dying to go to for years. I now have yet another specific artifact to seek out when I finally visit.*I do take a bit of issue with the title. Namely, that the word \"vilifies\" is totally misused. Yes, Cleveland and his administration denied the cancer and the surgery, but they were in no way disparaging or abusive towards journalists who were reporting otherwise."}, {"userName": "Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11995880-jordan", "userReview": "An interesting story of the relationship between the press and presidents.

Grover Cleveland is the only U.S. president to serve two nonconsecutive terms and shortly after beginning his second term in 1893, he discovered a growth on the roof of his mouth. Unfortunately, the country was in economic free-fall, the Panic of 1893, and Cleveland feared that news of his cancer would \"utterly shatter\" public confidence and have serious economic repercussions. As a result, it was decided that the operation would be performed in secret. On July 1, 1893, President Cleveland went on board the Oneida, a luxury yacht owned by a friend on which he had frequently sailed for fishing trips, for a five day vacation and fishing cruise on Long Island Sound. While on board, a team of surgeons removed the cancerous tumor from the roof of his mouth along with several teeth and part of his upper jaw. Then Cleveland was taken to his summer home, Gray Gables, on the southern tip of Cape Cod to recuperate from the operation and get used to wearing the dental device that would allow him to speak properly after the surgery. An enterprising reporter, E.J. Edwards uncovered the story and published a full account of the secret operation in the Philadelphia Press. However, he was viciously attacked by many other journalists because of Cleveland's reputation for \"telling the truth\" (his most famous quote--it was his response to his supporters when it was uncovered that may have fathered an illegitimate child during the campaign of 1884). Leading the attack, Alexander McClure of the Philadelphia Times attacked Edwards as a \"disgrace to journalism\". The truth wasn't revealed until 1917 when Dr. W.W. Keen received permission from Frances Cleveland Preston, Cleveland's widow, and published an account of the surgery in the Saturday Evening Post. E.J. Edwards was able to bask in the glow of the vindication of his reporting for 7 years until his death in 1924.

Along the way, bits of social history pepper the story -- including appearances from L. Frank Baum (the author posits on how double-meanings in The Wonderful Wizard of Oz serve as stand-ins for the debate on a gold versus silver monetary standard) and Stephen Crane, and medical histories of the time surrounding cancer, oral prostheses, and the uncommon practice of using antiseptics. Readable, enlightening, and illuminating on a dozen different subjects, one can't help but feel that this is how history should be written: in full acknowledgment that its characters were once lustily alive, fallibly human, and irreplaceable in their individuality.

Grover Cleveland's reputation as an honest reformer is merged with the very clear view of him as a determined and secretive politician. The only Democrat president from Buchanan to Wilson, Cleveland's two non-consecutive terms (1885-89, 1893-97) were characterized by the casting of more vetoes than all other presidents combined over an 8 year period and not surpassed until FDR (1933-45). Although this episode of illness represented a close brush with death via Cancer and lingering ailments stemming from overeating and excessive drink, Cleveland also conveyed the image of a robust, vigorous man who sired many children late in life.

Readers are rewarded with funny quotes from 1894 Senate debates and factoids about trends in presidential facial hair, among other gems."}, {"userName": "Mari", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1900650-mari", "userReview": "There's no more enjoyable reading than nonfiction written with the narrative flow, the drama (and the comedy) of a good novel. This book was all the more enjoyable because it details an historic event that I've known about since I was a child: My maternal grandfather, whose mentor at Jefferson was Dr. William Keen, was a beneficiary of the successful surgery."}, {"userName": "Marie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14164203-marie", "userReview": "An interesting read - however I skimmed quite a bit of it.

Learned some fascinating tidbits from that era I didn't know a lot about previously.

The book is very interesting and what I like most about it are the additional tidbits and sections throughout the book describing everyday life in the last decade of the nineteenth century.I would actually give this book only 4 1/2 stars though, if it were possible. The part of the title \"wherein the supposedly virtuous Grover Cleveland survives a secret surgery at sea and vilifies the courageous newspaperman who dared expose the truth\" is a bit misleading. The whole controversy itself is somewhat exaggerated. Given that Cleveland already was President when he discovered he had cancer, it makes sense that he would not want to alarm the country and bring the country to further chaos. It is hard to blame him for trying to keep quiet. As for the newspaperman, he was vilified, but not by Cleveland really, but by the rival newspaper. He wasn't really dismissed as a \"disgrace to journalism\" as it says on the back of the book, but only by his \"enemies\" at the other newspaper. He actually went on to have a very successful career. And all this nonsense was really a way to gain readership during these newspaper wars, when papers would go to incredible lengths to outdo each other. The public sympathized with Cleveland, and it seems they didn't care even if the rumors were true.As for the claim that the surgery affected Cleveland's judgement and, thereby, the rest of his presidency; it is somewhat spurious and cannot be proven. Most likely it was included so the reader feels there is some shock to this supposed conspiracy.Despite all this, it is a great book and definitely worth reading. The book really gives you the feel for the nineteenth century and it's an interesting story, even if it is not as \"shocking\" as the author would like us to believe. It is just a fun read and I would highly recommend."}], "description": "On July 1, 1893, President Grover Cleveland vanished. He boarded a friend\u2019s yacht, sailed into the calm blue waters of Long Island Sound, and--poof!--disappeared. He would not be heard from again for five days. What happened during those five days, and in the days and weeks that followed, was so incredible that, even when the truth was finally revealed, many Americans simply would not believe it.The President Is a Sick Man details an extraordinary but almost unknown chapter in American history: Grover Cleveland\u2019s secret cancer surgery and the brazen political cover-up by a politician whose most memorable quote was \u201cTell the truth.\u201d When an enterprising reporter named E. J. Edwards exposed the secret operation, Cleveland denied it. The public believed the \u201cHonest President,\u201d and Edwards was dismissed as \u201ca disgrace to journalism.\u201d The facts concerning the disappearance of Grover Cleveland that summer were so well concealed that even more than a century later a full and fair account has never been published.
