Did I enjoy it? Not exactly, no. Did I regret the time spent reading it? No, it's a well written book. Indeed, the plotting is its main strength, switching effectively between the two main characters, without a lot of re-hashing events. While I wasn't thrilled with Billie, Nora's aunt, as a person, the arc of her story did work to propel the story towards its conclusion. The other, minor characters worked well I thought, especially Juliette (who appears briefly near the very end).Nora herself I wasn't so crazy about. She came across as self-centered; her moments of caring about Isaac seemed forced, and her \"devotion\" (to use a word that Morton way over-uses) to her aunt implied some sort of guilt, or perhaps resentment, that may have been too subtle for me. In the end, I wasn't really rooting for her, though I didn't dislike her enough to root against her either ... just what-EVER ...Isaac, on other hand, was well drawn (for the most part). He didn't come across as a \"failure\", but as someone with poor self-promotion skills. A rather reclusive famous photographer treats him as a friend; I came away feeling that the man accepted Isaac because he knew that Isaac wouldn't ever try to take advantage of him. Not to say it's too late - Isaac does show an interest in a possible career advancing opportunity late in the story. So, he's flawed, but potentially redeemable.So, would I recommend this one? Yes, though I wouldn't fault folks who give up on it either as there's work for the payoff."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3680008-michael", "userReview": "Issac and Nora love for each other has transcended over years, and have never lost it`s passion. After years of contemplating about whether one thinks of each other, Nora first makes the first step when she calls Isaac. Issac recognizes her silence without her saying a word, and the two decided to meet up and rebuild what was broken. Although Nora is in a relationship, she never stop loving Isaac and she struggles to break things off with her current mate. As a photographer, Isaac captures pictures that has been featured in top the magazines and when he is not taking photos, he is thinking of Nora and the life they shared. In addition, Norah takes care of her sickly aunt Billie and writes fiction for a living, but when one of her portraits resembles Issac life, their relationship is tested in more ways than they can imagined. This is an outstanding novel about love, hope and forgiveness, it has been awhile since I read a romantic book that has captured me from the beginning, to the end."}, {"userName": "Patricia Tyburczy-bettis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11100150-patricia-tyburczy-bettis", "userReview": "I often choose character driven novels, and so that is what was appealing to me about this story. Also, it isn't necessary for me to like the characters in order to remain interested in what is happening with them. To my mind, this is a story about obession, and how following that, whether it is a physical and emotional attachment for another, or the drive to manifest one's creative core, can either save or destroy you. It is about the consequences of choice, and ultimately what we learn about ourselves, or do not. Sometimes it appears to be a \"selfish\" choice to make writing or painting or dance or sculpture a priority to those who do not share the same inner drive and vision.

I struggled with rating this one, 'liked it?' or 'really liked it?' The truth is I really liked it. While Brian Morton is not among my favorite writers and his occasional, out of the blue and over the top description of some inanimate object was slightly irritating\u2026 I could not wait to get back to this book. Norah and Isaac I got and he nailed them circumstance after circumstance. He presented their weaknesses and strengths in the most casual way as they struggled with the relationship they have with each other and the relationship they have with themselves. Norah particularly hit a nerve with her struggle with using the people around her as fodder for writing. I am constantly waging a war with myself on what bridges are worth burning for a good story and what stories are best kept to myself. How far can I push a person before they go from mildly irritated to pissed off for good? Norah was so familiar I sometimes cringed and that's what a good writer does right? Point us to ourselves?

Brian Morton's development of characters was done very well I thought. It is a love story with a different presentation, in that the female is an author, who is creative when she is writing about those that she knows personally and she presents many negative points. It is hard to hold onto friends and family and lovers, when the writing is shared. Her love interest is a photographer who has a great love of his choice of career and even though he has had some success, he is not really as successful as he thought he would be and should be at this time of his life. He struggles internally and believe that Nora is his true love, as she does of him.

This is my favorite of the three novels I've read so far. Interestingly, several of my friends did NOT like the one Brian Morton novel I recommended they read (Florence Gordon). I suspect some readers can't see past the negative aspects of characterization and conclude that these novels are like so much of the typical cynical nasty contemporary fiction out there.

I hoped the author would eventually bring me somewhere worth journeying. The concept of two artists of differing mediums connecting & reuniting after five years apart, seemed intriguing. However, for me, the book essentially went nowhere. While I liked the character of Issac--noble, prideful, honest in his conflicting thoughts, Nora & Billie felt forced, unrealistic. Bille's purpose was, I suppose, meant to bring out Nora's compassion & devotion, yet neither was convincing. Billie led most of her life empty & tragically alone. Nora extended herself when/where she thought she should, but she always kept her own interests first. She was too selfish to be a mother, a singular caregiver, or commit herself to the love of her life. I did find the inner thoughts & conflicts of the two main characters interesting, & ultimately that is why I kept reading. I realize this is character-driven novel, but nothing much happened. We're told Issac changed, but I didn't feel either he or Nora grew in any significant way. Isaac became disgruntled with his art, & Nora chose to cave to her muse's method despite the fact it only found success by hurting those she claimed to care for. Love is not big enough for Nora, & because the book ends with no conclusion, the relationship seemed to be doomed even if we wanted to imagine it could go forward. Worse, their relationship seemed meaningless; they understood each other (in the \"soulmate-like way\"), yet they couldn't find fulfillment apart or together.

Nora did that...) at first. That did get better, or I got used to it. Worse: I did not like Nora. I could have been okay with that if I'd changed my mind by the end, but I didn't, because instead of seeing her mistakes and working to fix them, she shrugged it off and said that's just who I am; love it or leave it. I have a huge issue with knowing you're hurting people or hurting yourself and thinking it's okay because it's just who you are.I still could have been okay with it if Isaac had come to his senses and stopped putting up with it instead of being a rug she walked on and therefore, an accomplice to her superficial kind of \"love\" for others.Along with this are some very pointed political statements unnecessary to the story that almost made me think the story was written in order to throw out the authors political views and for not much more than that.I'm still giving it 3 stars for some good writing, an interesting concept, and because hopefully it will bring to light how some people are so willing to use others and how they get away with doing so. It's a good character study. The end left me thinking, \"Is that it?\" but then, I think that's the point of the story.

In the synopses I read beforehand, Nora, the author who reconnects with an old boyfriend, starts writing a story which she belated realizes is a thinly-veiled, negative portrait of her boyfriend. In the book however, she knows basically from the start that it's about her boyfriend, moreover, Morton spends several dozen pages giving a history of Nora's writing, a series of stories that were all thinly-veiled, negative portraits of those closest to her. The synopses all offered this epic struggle of Nora's art vs her love, whether she should write the story or not. In the book, however, she knows from the start what she's doing and does it anyway, so no real struggle. The reader knows everything but the ending after the first 50-75 pages but has to read 100 more pages just to get to the ending. Finally, I'm not a huge fan of writers who constantly name drop authors in an attempt to sound more literary, or repeatedly offer up pop culture references, which dates the book and distracts readers who didn't live in New York in 2000."}, {"userName": "Chanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2009682-chanda", "userReview": "I am having a difficult time finding anything redeeming about this book.
