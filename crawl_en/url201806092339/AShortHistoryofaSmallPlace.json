About half-way through the third chapter, the narration just sounded like rambling jibberish and the clever turns-of-phrase got missed in the tedium.

One of the best scenes is when the narrator, Louis, and his Daddy have \"the talk.\"(page 288)\"...And once they're married they can become what we call intimate without other people looking sideways at them.''Intimate?' I said.But Daddy rolled on ahead of me and recommenced with, 'But there are some men, and some women too I suppose, who want to go direct to intimate without ever dancing much. Do you see what I mean?'And I looked up at Daddy who was looking down at me with his lips turned up in a sickly sort of way and his face partway blue from the mercury light overhead, and I was just about to tell him Lord, no, I didn't see what he meant when it hit me like a sledgehammer blow to the forehead. Daddy was talking about plugging, or anyway that's what Everet Little calls it even though his sister, Angela Kirstan, insists the scientific term for it is getting intercoursed which Bill Ed Myrick says his brother tells him is most probably undoubtedly correct since word around town is that Angela Kirstan is taking a degree in it.\"Funny stuff.

The characters are extremely well drawn but the writing style is so pains-taking that it is awkward to read. after spending almost 3 weeks trying to read this book and only being halfway through i realized i didn't like it well enough to give it another 3 weeks. wish i knew why i thought i should read it? :)(Later...) oh for pete's sake, i just noticed my review of \"Cry Me a River\" by this same author (a book i loved) and i said in that review \"i'm going to try other books by this author and see if they are as good\".

T. R. Pearson's story of an imaginary small place called Neely, North Carolina took me back to my own childhood with its small-town vernacular. Louis Benfield, the youthful narrator, turns observations of the mundane into sublime comedy and bittersweet moments. As you read this prose, be patient. Sip it like your favorite coffee or tea. The build up is worth the turn of the next page with capstones such as:\"Mrs. Phillip J. King is what Daddy calls a legwagger so it is near impossible to watch her talk without getting yourself hypnotized or half agitated or maybe a little dizzy and nauseous, and of course I got hit with the dizzy and nauseous part of it once the legwagging and eau de garden salad aroma took up together and came at me. What few bites of pecan twirl I had managed to get down were organizing to come back out for an airing, so I excused myself to Mrs. Phillip J. King and Momma and went off to the bathroom to hang my head over the toilet.\"Characters ponder their surroundings in ways that are, at times, quite unexpected, resulting in colorful descriptions such as:\"Itty Bit passed the time in barking fairly persistently at nothing much in particular. We'd all grown somewhat accustomed to the aggravation of it, so nobody paid any attention to Itty Bit except for Mr. Bobby Ligon, who was sitting on his heels just to her backside, and he spent a full minute and a half in devoted contemplation of Itty Bit's rearend, tilting his head first towards one shoulder and then towards the other. You know, he said at last, I wish you'd just look how that little dog's shithole opens up every time he barks.\" ----- which leads to Louis's Daddy explaining one of Newton's Laws of Nature and the concept of balanced thrust. Anyone who has grown up in a yard with work to be done (or perhaps, like me, with a mock orange bush on the homestead) can place themselves into Louis's shoes when his Daddy sends him to the backyard with a rake:\"Confronting the mock orange bush had simply become what Daddy called a point of honor, a sort of obligation he had seen through until I could inherit it. So once a year in November I wake up on a Saturday with the sort of feeling that must come over birds just before they migrate, and I get straight out of bed into my playclothes and put on my carcoat and my workgloves and my green corduroy hat with the earflaps and I fetch the rake out of our cellar and set out for the bottom of the back lot, where I am condemned to thrash at the mock orange bushes for the balance of the day. And that is when it usually happens, not while I'm still trying to extract from the mock oranges everything that has blown or fallen into them in the course of the year, but after I have left off from the struggle for a spell and have sat down on the grass where I pluck at the rakehead to make the tines sing, and I listen to the sound of the sprung metal dying away sometimes mixed with the cry of a hound or the low, indecipherable noise of a voice on the air, and suddenly I am aware of the sort of chill I haven't known in a year and I notice that the sky is very high and tufted and the color of ash in a grate, which is the color of my breath, which is the color of the afternoon, which is the color of the season; and I know it isn't autumn anymore.\" Sublime."}, {"userName": "Kristal", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2504140-kristal", "userReview": "This story is written with an amazing sense of lyrical style and some of the most colorful and descriptive narratives that I have ever read. Told through the eyes of Louis Benfield, jr., a young boy who has been handed down the different parts of the story through various townspeople, it all weaves back and forth around one central person, Miss Myra Angelique Pettigrew. Along with a host of characters - a set of crazy sisters, a dishonest plumber, a power-hungry politician, a postal employee with a hankering for jurisprudence, and a shoe-less ape, they all reside in the fictitious town of Neely, North Carolina. Each character's story has an underlying moral theme that revels itself slowly (like molasses in June, so my Mama always said) yet each story circles back and together each one makes a whole. It is a delightful Southern read. I did come upon a phrase in the book that I would like to start using on a daily basis while I compute back and forth doing my daily errands to refer to the driving habits of local persons: habitual vehicular stupidity. Yeap, I can pretty much say that everyday."}, {"userName": "Jolynn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25004789-jolynn", "userReview": "A Short History of a Small Place is undoubtedly one of the most hilarious books I have ever read.

That funny! if you are from a small town in the South -- do not miss out on this gem published in 1985.

Are you familiar with the Alice's Restaurant song?

But the writing style is right up my alley. The colorful characters, the colorful descriptions of the characters, the descriptions of...well, anything make me smile! It's very hard to find a stopping point to put the book down. Paragraphs can last a page or two. In the Junius chapter, things rambled off so much that when the story picked back up (Junius chapter, part v), I had no recollection of who Mr. Pipkin and Mr. Newberry were and what they were up to. It came back to me but part iv had been so long and had taken such a left turn from the original story, I lost track. BUT---I'm enjoying the book, I have no idea where it's going, or honestly, if it's going at all. I do know people who tell a long rambling story like this one. When they finish, instead of one story, you've had several. It's a bonus! But your head is spinning from trying to keep up with it all.
