For example, I never attended a Catholic private school. And even if my middle school had a \u2018\u2018Religion\u2019\u2019 class, I was placed in the \u2018\u2018Moral\u2019\u2019 one with the other students who weren\u2019t Catholic. I liked it. We talked about what it means to have morals and be a decent human being. But Michael is now attending such a school, because his father uprooted their family to a new city for his job and enrolled him at a prestigious school that happens to be thoroughly Catholic. I say \u2018\u2018thoroughly Catholic\u2019\u2019 because St. Clare\u2019s has a \u2018\u2018Father\u2019\u2019 as principal and \u2018\u2018Sisters\u2019\u2019 as teachers.And guess what? Michael is atheist. His classmates are\u2026 not. They pray in class and go to mess and discuss saints and such. Things that Michael is not interesting in. Not at all. However, the moment he thinks he will never fit in and make friends, he meets a group of people who call themselves the \u2018\u2018Heretics Anonymous\u2019\u2019 and bonds with them like he never did with anyone else. This story reminded me of the book Moxie by Jennifer Mathieu. While Moxie and Heretics Anonymous focus on different topics, they both feature a high school whose rules are questionable and strict and whose student body deserves to know the hypocrisy of the institution that is supposed to educate the future leaders of the world. So the goal of the Heretics Anonymous is to push students to think critically about issues quickly covered up by authority figures, the different regulations enforced that students are expected to follow blindly as well as the wrong information given by the school, especially when it comes to sex education. FYI, that specific part is hilarious. It seems like such a serious story with heavy themes and a cast of characters that wish to revolutionize the way their school functions in general. All of that is true and the characters\u2019 intentions certainly are noble, but they also make mistakes before realizing that nothing is either black or white; there are shades of gray everywhere, and although we all want to be right and for our opinion to be the one that matters most, we have to consider other people when we plan to change how things work in a community, and a school is a community of a sort.Surprisingly, their mistakes are very entertaining and the ideas they come up with to influence the student body to think differently quite interesting, though not particularly original since some are similar to those featured in Moxie. I found myself smiling while reading about the friendship dynamics between Michael and his crew, the Heretics Anonymous, seeing that they discuss not only the school and Catholicism, but also their own particular beliefs that shape who they are as a person. Lucy especially is a wise, if not a little stubborn, young woman who\u2019s not going to try to convert you, but will show you how important it is to believe in something, anything, and not necessarily God. It can be love. It can be friendship. It can be family. In sum, this is light-hearted enough to make you smile and laugh during certain parts, but undeniably realistic, meaning that other scenes will hit you hard with their raw emotions. I would have given it more, and certainly wanted to, but except for dear Lucy, we as readers are not particularly connected to the Heretics Anonymous members. We get a sense of their personalities and what matters to them most, but they seemed to exist for the purpose of this group alone, whereas Lucy is still Lucy whether she\u2019s part of the group or not, and because she becomes very important to Michael. Still, quite enjoyable.

It challenges Catholic dogma, while being understanding and respectful of faith in general - not a small fit.I found the YA part much less compelling, the main characters felt like carriers of traits rather than full personalities, especially the narrator - a 16-year boy of a very bland, self-insert kind who eventually is involved in an equally bland romance, although with a significantly more interesting girl.

The cast is so wonderfully diverse--and made a particular effort to give representation and/or mention to every group I can think of when it comes to religion and spirituality.The comedy! I laughed out loud at least once a page. Michael has absolutely identical level and style of sarcasm. As someone who was an atheist and went to Catholic high school, I vividly remember noticing, thinking, and saying things he does. He also has a habit of putting his foot in his mouth for the first half of the book which was just...so incredibly hilarious (and oh so relateable)While I most related to Michael, I found Lucy so incredibly interesting. I know so many people in their 20s and 30s who are not atheists or agnostics but they struggle identifying with official religious institutions because they have not modernized or refuse to acknowledge history.The ragtag group in Heretics Anonymous was so well done and I loved all the debates and conflicts they have. It's realistic with all their different perspectives and personal priorities.I cannot find a single thing about this book I didn't like. It did such a good job of presenting conflicts and a diverse cast without villainizing anyone.

His dad keeps getting promoted within his company, which has sent Michael and his family traveling across the country, and Michael has been promised that this is the last move. Michael ends up making friends with other \"heretics\" at his school: people who, for various reasons, do not fit the mold of a Catholic school student. They meet together as a sort of unofficial support group, until Michael challenges them to begin changing the system. Thus the group of heretics start fighting back against what they see as injustice at their school. While Michael himself and his friend Lucy are both well-developed characters, we learn much less about the other members of HA, which is unfortunate. Watching them plan and fight back against their school with mixed results reminds me of Jennifer Mathieu's Moxie. The story is about the group of characters, but mostly it's about Michael and his relationship with his friends and also with his family. Michael's frustrations at being moved across country on the whims of his parents will ring true to teens who have had to move in the middle of a school year. I was impressed by the inclusion of an atheist character, as this is a rare occurrence in teen contemporary literature.

My favorite aspect of this book was the rebellious group, Heretics Anonymous. I loved that even though they were all different in their own way that they still fit. It showed that it\u2019s possible for people to have different views and different beliefs and still be able to not only get along, but to legitimately care for one another and that was so heartwarming.

Now, he has to attend St. Clare's Catholic School, which isn't exactly the best place to be for an atheist like him. His presumptions of everyone being uptight and religious are flung out the window, when he gets initiated into a secret club called Heretics Anonymous. Even within the austere boundaries of this school, there exists a group of students who choose to have differing beliefs and aren't ready to get brainwashed by the system. But when Michael takes it all a step too far, he jeopardizes everything he has worked to build.10 points for that cover!What started out as a hilarious book soon turns into a bit of a serious read and rightly so. Michael's wit and sarcasm will surely make you crack up at times. There's such honesty in his thoughts. But underlying all that bravado you get the sense of boy flailing at his inability to stay rooted to a place, and therefore distraught by the constant disruption in his life. This is Katie Henry's debut novel and I must admit that she has crafted a remarkable storyline. With everything that's going on in our world, religious intolerance is something that has been cause for concern for a long time now. But do we ever stop to think how children perceive themselves through a religious angle, how do they fit into all this?In this novel, it is very refreshing to see teenagers who are not only well informed about their choices but also standing up for their beliefs, however different they may be. When Michael joins Heretics Anonymous, he is met with a broad range of thought processes; those belonging to a Celtic Reconstructionist Pagan, a Catholic Christian and others that I hadn't even heard about. The author's writing complements the story, in that, you feel like you've been taken back to your school days. It's not wordy or hard to digest. It has everything a high-school fiction usually does - drama, betrayal, romance (puppy love?), rebelling. But on top of all that, it has some mature viewpoints too!Michael's relation with his father is strained but I couldn't help feeling bad for them both. In my opinion, they are both right on their part. I just wish that they'd talked it out sooner, because it would've prevented a lot of negativity. I didn't personally connect with any of the characters, but that didn't deter me from being invested in their story. In conclusion, I did enjoy reading this book, even though I couldn't understand the hype. If you are the kind of person who gets easily offended by religious and spiritual diversity, maybe this book is not for you. But I hope that's not true. I hope you can pick up a book like this in good faith and just have fun reading it.What do you get out of it?\u00a0New perspective on religious identities and all the excitement of attending high-school.Thank you HarperCollins for this eARC via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Derek Milman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29267899-derek-milman", "userReview": "Katie Henry has a biting wit, a sharp sense of humor, and a real big heart.

Atheist Michael--constantly getting moved around, courtesy of his dad's corporate job--finds a whole other set of challenges once he lands at a Catholic School. However, things get even more interesting after he falls in with a group of fellow outcasts, all colorful characters in their own right, and together they form a secret club to challenge the absurdities of the world (and their school).

A Korean kid, named Max, who I also think is on the spectrum though it is not disclosed on the page. And a Latina girl, Lucy, who is the Catholic feminist badass that i didn't know i needed.

From the start of the novel we see Michael as relatable and someone to relate with. The most relatable aspect of the character is how he constantly messes everything up. Michael has a talent for making a mess of everything he does and it is a huge refresher from the usual perfect main character seen in some YA books.Other than Michael, each and every character is lovable in their own way. Within the small society of Heretics Anonymous you cannot help but find one of the characters who you see yourself in. The equivalent of the antagonists are not painted as evil characters either. Every single main character has redeeming factors. They have aspects of themselves which you are forced to deal with and grudgingly accept them for (Even if Theresa is still my least favorite). The overall message of this book encourages understanding, acceptance, and social reform which is very admirable and the message is put together well. The different aspects of comedy and philosophy draw you in and keep you wanting more. I loved this book and it is a must read for anyone with an open mind and maybe working tear ducts."}, {"userName": "Ms. Yingling", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2636606-ms-yingling", "userReview": "E ARC from Edelweiss PlusMichael is angry enough at his parents that they have moved him and his sister yet again for his father's job as he goes into his junior year, but to enroll him in a Catholic school, no matter how good, makes him even angrier. He's an agnostic, and prepared to have a miserable time. Luckily, on the very first day he hears Lucy arguing with the teacher about religious points and thinks he has a soul mate. He does, in a way-- Lucy identifies herself as a heretic, in that her beliefs aren't quite sanctioned by the church, but she is very much a believer. She has a small group of other students who don't necessarily toe the line in plain black shoes, and they all decide that it's time to make their opinions known. They manage to do some underhanded but well thought out pranks, like changing the sex ed/abstinence video, but things get serious when the Latin teacher loses her job when her same-sex marriage comes to the attention of the school. Michael and Lucy start to date, and Michael's issues with his family situation also reach a tipping point. Personal note: Ms. Henry is clearly a far, far better human being than I am! I have been an atheist since confirmation class, and of all the people who have been flat-out mean to me in my life, religious people have been the absolute meanest. Ms. Henry gets ENORMOUS bonus points for not only really understanding and describing Michael's beliefs, but for describing and being kind about ALL of the different beliefs she portrays. It's an incredibly difficult thing to do, and she pulls it off with a great deal of good humor as well!Also, not really a middle grade book. Definitely read before purchasing for readers younger than high school. Strengths: This is funny, timely, and explores a very little covered area of teen life. I spent a LOT of time involved with my church group in middle school and high school, and even more time thinking about what I believed and what I didn't. This comes up very rarely in literature, and this book covers not only Catholicism and agnosticism, but a couple of other, more exotic beliefs as well. The romance with Lucy is great, and the issues with Michael's family are realistically poignant. The cover is absolutely fantastic!Weaknesses: Drinking and allusions to sexual behavior, while mild, make this more of a YA title.

She then invites him into her group of others who don't conform, there is Avi who is gay and Jewish, Eden who can practice her pagan beliefs, and Max who can wear what he wants (cloaks). This group begins to go public to the school in different ways. There first form of action is stealing the dvd they show as their sexEd which contain all scientific inaccuracies.
