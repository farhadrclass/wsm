I will read the next one in the series. I did enjoy it.Pro's first :)1) Interesting Concept with fresh ideas. Demons! No sparkly Vamps!2) Easy to read Voice/writing style 3) Pretty Decent Charcterization overall, they had depth, stayed true to self, and there were some touching moments.4) Decent World Building5) I liked the demons. I liked the Demon world buiding, descriptions and hierarchyCons: Not really cons about the book itself, just little things that irked me as a reader. I applaud Ms Oliver's writing!1) I'm confused on why there are demons roaming the earth to start with.2) If gas is so expensive how can Riley have a car when she can't pay her rent, and also how can she afford to buy her supplies? Holy water is 12.00 a pint or something like that...it was hypocritcal to the storyline3) The way she treats Beck really grated on my nerves, and I wanted to slap her upside her head loads of times.4) Speaking of Beck, his dialogue drove me INSANE. I get he's a good ole country boy, but saying Ya instead of you, and Yer instead of your. Seriously? It broke my concentration when reading. It was distracting. It made him seem stupid. Maybe that was the point? Wasn't that what the witch was hinting at anyways?5) If Master Asshat is such an asshat, why do the others let him rule? You out number him, impeach! impeach! He abuses his apprentices, is a raging alcoholic, and is a major fucking asshole. Why do they let that stand? And if they know he is an abusing, womanizing asshat, why do they allow Riley to be his apprentice? Um no? Hell no. 6) God I hate love issues. triangle? square? Um, no thanks!7) Way too many questions, none of them answered, and then more questions piled on. I felt like I was reading Karen Marie Moning. now, don't get me wrong, I love me some KMM, but this is the first book of the series. I hope it's not drawn out like the Fever series. I won't read it. You hear me Ms Oliver? I won't do it! Just say NO to cliffhangers =) (This is tongue and cheek people, tongue and cheek!)"}, {"userName": "~Tina~", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2594672-tina", "userReview": "(4.5Stars)TBR Reduce Challenge #10- 2011 (Alexa) The Demon Trapper's Daughter is a really solid book. It's fast paced, has some great world building and I loved the clever characters and crisp straightforward dialog and wicked writing style.Riley is a great MC, I liked that she wasn't some cocky know-it-all with attitude, she makes mistakes but isn't delusional to think she's above it all. She fears but she's a fighter and wants to prove she can be one of the greats, like her dad, and survive in a mans world. I respect that in a character and look forward to seeing some real growth in up coming books.I really liked all of the characters in this one, but I think my favorite is Beck. For one thing he's a lot older for a YA, but he's funny, with a great sarcastic-easy-going-attitude. He brings a lot of life into this world.The plot is very rich with imagination and creativity. I really enjoyed the way all the demons had specific names to go along with there rank and how dangerous they are, the magpie was my fav;) I also liked that there were a few other paranormal elements added to this world, but it's not overly done so it didn't feel overwhelming. I loved the methods that the trappers used and just basically the entire operation of it all. This would make a kick-ass anime! Just saying.Overall, I just really loved this one! Fun, entertaining and captivating.A great great start to a series I can't wait to continue."}, {"userName": "Alexa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1894085-alexa", "userReview": "My review can also be found on my blog Collections.4.5 starsAfter reading some reviews, I wasn\u2019t sure whether or not I would like this book. I heard some unappealing things about the characters, especially Riley. I also heard that the romance included a love-triangle. (Actually, it was scarier than that because the reviews made it sound like a love-square.) I don\u2019t enjoy reading a book where I dislike the main character all the way through, and it\u2019s rare that I like a love-triangle or anything more than that. So it just seemed the book wasn't going to work out for me. But I'm so glad I gave this book a chance because this was a case where my experience with the book ended up being completely different from those reviews I read.The Demon Trapper's Daughter is about seventeen-year-old Riley Blackthorne, who wants to be a Demon Trapper like her father. Riley does as much as she can to prove that she's capable of taking care of herself by holding her own against the demons and the males that dominate the Trapper world she chooses to live in. She isn't perfect though. She makes mistakes and some poor decisions, but she's strong and smart enough to make up for it when it really counts. Some may not like Riley's attitude towards Denver Beck, her father's twenty-two-year-old apprentice, but I think her feelings are pretty justified. She had a huge crush on Beck a few years back, and it seems he went about rejecting her by being a complete ass jerk. I also believe Riley's envious of all the time Beck gets to be around her father, who has been too busy with demon trapping lately to spend quality time with his daughter. The good thing is Riley and Beck's relationship improves little by little through the book. Another thing I liked was that the book also included chapters from Beck's perspective. I really enjoyed his character. He's funny, loyal, and protective. He's been through a whole lot more than most people his age. It was refreshing seeing the world viewed by an adult in a YA book, even though this book didn't exactly feel like a YA. The book was definitely more focused on aspects other than romance, which I'm glad for. It's true, though, that it sounds like there's going to be love-triangle or potentially even a love-square. At this point, I'm all for Riley and Beck! I'm really liking their development together. However, right now, there's a romance between Riley and Simon. Simon\u2019s another fellow Demon Trapper. He's 20 years old and a really nice, good-looking guy. I can understand the appeal, but I admit I wasn't quite feeling their relationship. It moved a bit too fast, and I felt Simon was lacking that extra special something that would have made him stand out. It didn\u2019t help that there were other, more interesting guys like Beck and the mysterious Ori, who I think could be possible love-interests for Riley. I think Riley and Simon would be better off as friends, but I'm sure there will be (and I\u2019m hoping for) more development in the next book between Riley and all the guys, so we'll see. ;)I decided to only mention the characters and the relationships in this review, since those two things are the most important to me when it comes to determining if I like a book. (And if I kept going, this review would never end.) I will say though that the ending wasn't what I expected, and I wish it went just a tiny bit slower because there was a lot to take in with all the scene changes. Other than that I thought The Demon Trapper's Daughter was a great start to the series, and I cannot wait to read the next book Soul Thief!"}, {"userName": "Lala_Loopsie [fire breathing B!tch Queen]", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41378358-lala-loopsie-fire-breathing-b-tch-queen", "userReview": "[And then her dad dies, she is now an orphan at 17. not as uncommon as you think. but she can't even cut her dad up to pieces to save him from necromancers? --And i get how emotional that moment would be, but i would try just to keep him from being a mindlees (apparently not so mindles) slave bought by the highest bidder, only to go back to the grave after about a year.

I'm usually introduced to series, after a few of the books have already been released. Sometimes, it's better that way. You don't have to wait a year for the next one. Anyway, this year I'm extremely excited about a few new series, \"Nevermore\" and \"Hex Hall.\" Now I can add this book to the list, unfortunately it doesn't actually come out until next year, so that means waiting even longer for the second book. It's worth it in my opinion. I don't usually overly boost about a book, but I'm excited about this new series. There is a lot of potential to build upon. The characters are really likable and sassy. I like sassy and strong minded heroines and heroes. There are plenty of those in this book. I usually pick one of the guys who are potential love interests and start crushing on them, then I cheer them on. I would have to say, I can't decide between Denver Beck or Simon Adler, plus Ori. I can't forget about him. Which to choose... hummmmmm... Okay, I will admit that I prefer redneck Beck and mysterious Ori to goody-two-shoes Simon.I also really liked the premise behind this book, good verses evil and trappers who hunt the demons. I thoughts this book was fast paced. You get enough back story, but not in a boring too much information way. I really loved Riley's character. She's a fighter without being too macho. Oh, I can't forget the cute Magpie demones, who steal shiny objects and flip you the bird. Too cute. Plus, they get stored in sippee-cups. Hilarious.

Who knows. As it is - I have read 160 pages and struggled for the last 20 or so with the first notions of boredom - my opinion of the book is best represented by 2 stars. The \"person\" I liked best about the book so far was that tiny, bling-addicted Klepto Demon in ninja garb, who miraculously returned to Riley's apartment after Riley caught him and Beck sold him for her. So cute. Tell me, Goodreaders, did she get to keep him as a pet/companion?(Another thing to like is the cover, because it fits. Riley works in jeans and sneakers and she carries glass orbs filled with holy water to defeat grade-3-demons with them. For people, who - like me - like stories with alternating points of view: Enjoy: The narration switches smoothly back and forth between Riley and Beck.)"}, {"userName": "Theresa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229058-theresa", "userReview": "I've never done a DNF (did not finish) review before-- usually I don't get far enough into a book I don't like to actually qualify it as review material. But Jana Oliver's The Demon Trapper's Daughter is unusual in that I made it most of the way before giving it up as being too irritating to be worth the effort to finish. Obviously you don't need to read this whole review to know what my final verdict will be. \"The Demon Trapper's Daughter\" is the story of Riley Blackthorn, the daughter of a well-known demon trapper who wants to follow in her father's footsteps. At seventeen Riley has been training as an apprentice to her father long enough to be trusted to trap a minor demon on her own. But her fist solo trapping goes awry as it becomes clear that two demons are working together and, even worse, they seem to know Riley's name. Riley thinks things can't get worse as video of her escapades hits the net, but another fatal collusion between demons leads to her father's death. Alone in the world Riley knows the only thing she can do to survive is to become an independent trapper, but she must first finish her apprenticeship and her new master not only hated her father, but doesn't think woman are capable of working as trappers. But becoming a master trapper is only the first of Riley's challenges: she must also stand vigil at her father's grave for twelve nights to prevent necromancers from animating and selling her father's body, and sort out her feelings for two young men-- one of whom she's had feelings for since she was a child. \"The Demon Trapper's Daughter\" has a lot of interesting premises. In this dystopian world angels, demons, Heaven and Hell aren't a matter of faith, but known for a fact to exist. It isn't spelled out when the demons first appeared, but the world has significantly changed. Everything is extraordinarily expensive and school is held in old coffee shops and grocery stores. Demons range from harmless little magpies that steal odd items from your home to monstrosities that have to be hunted down with holy water and lots of weapons. And it was the mythology that kept me interested long enough to really give this book a go. However, as I got further into the story I kept getting distracted and irritated by the YA elements that Oliver kept throwing into the story to keep the young adult label, and the incongruity of that with the book's more adult content. Because Riley is seventeen the story is littered with the requisite teenage dramas of boyfriends and bullies and that would be fine if it were balanced well within the story; but it's not. For a book that's targeted at young adults, there is a lot of profanity and frank sexuality. We don't get sex scenes, which might explain how the book keeps it YA designation, but it's definitely a book for older teens at best. But I persevered beyond the language, despite my feeling that it wasn't right for the age designation, because I kept hoping for the payoff. There were a couple of different mysteries within the story, one concerning the holy water and another regarding a reality-TV show about Vatican sponsored demon hunting, that had the potential to go somewhere. But as I reached the last fifty pages of the book too many annoying distractions took away my ability to care how the story resolved itself. One of my main beefs with \"The Demon Trapper's Daughter\" is the constant insistence that women would be regarded as less able to hunt demons. It just doesn't jibe with a rough demon infested world that anyone capable of handling a weapon is going to be disregarded because of their gender. It just seemed contrived to appeal to an audience that would likely be largely female and addicted to \"Twilight.\" But the coup de gr\u00e2ce for me was the random introduction of too many \"hot\" guys who are destined to flirt with the main character. We already had two love interests in the first two-thirds of the book, so when the story edges into it's final chapters there seemed no reason to bring anyone else into the mix. I'm sure the character had something to do with at least one of the mysteries that needed to be solved, but his appearance was too abrupt, too convenient and totally off-putting. I admit that I am not a huge fan of YA fiction that gets into the whole does he like me or doesn't he like me? mold. But I can overlook teen angst if the story is interesting enough. Books like The Hunger Games and Divergent worked for me because there was a logic to the story as well as a good emotional payoff. But \"The Demon Trapper's Daughter\" jumped around too much for my logic-loving brain and didn't strike the right chords for me emotionally to make it work. Despite my reservations, this book seems to be a big hit among the teen crowd, if the reviews on Amazon are any guide, but I suspect that most adult readers looking for a nice paranormal diversion would probably be better served by avoiding this one."}, {"userName": "Carmel (Rabid Reads)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4561998-carmel-rabid-reads", "userReview": "Original review posted by Rabid Reads: http://www.rabidreads.com/2011/06/review-demon-trappers-daughter-by-jana.htmlThis book was such a fun read! I enjoyed it from beginning to end; there were a few sad parts but the quirky lower grade demons always managed to put a smile on my face. I read this book while killing time on the various flights I took during my vacation. There were a few points in time where I didn't touch the book for days but it was easy to pick-up right where I left off. No re-reading required. Although, backtracking a bit wouldn't have been a bad thing in this case because this novel is just so good! Oddly enough I think the demons were my favorite part about this book. They're ranked on a scale of 1 to 5 (I think 5 is the max because nothing higher was mentioned). Riley only \"officially\" deals with the lower grades as she's just starting out in the world of trapping. I adored the Klepto-Fiends with their little bags and how they're attracted to shinny baubles. You have one guess as to what this hell spawn's main attribute is! I totally want one! The fact that Riley uses sippy-cups to contain them is hilarious. Don't be fooled though, the lower grade demons can still do a lot of damage and the five's are downright scary. Riley is a fantastic character whom Jana Oliver developed extremely well. She doesn't take no for an answer and knows from the very beginning what she wants to be when she grows up: a trapper. Miss Blackthorne is the first female in the business and I really admired her determination to make it in a \"man's world\". Tragedy strikes at every turn but Riley keeps at it. Her young age was comically illustrated a few times such as when she was worried about having to go to school with green demon pee all over. Blackthorne is forced to grow up really quickly in this book but she handles it extremely well. Jana Oliver couldn't have come up with a better character for this story's heroine.My crush on Beck was almost instantaneous. He's rough around the edges, sarcastic and sexy; the perfect ying to Riley's yang. Nothing romantic happens between these two protagonists but a few hints are dropped and I really hope that sparks fly in the second installment of this series. Overall, Beck still remains a mystery to readers. There's definitely more to him than meets the eye but I guess only time will tell what sort of secrets he keeps! His actions show that he has a softer side beneath his tough guy exterior. There were a few instances where I thought to myself aaaww, he's so thoughtful and sweet!The Demon Trapper's Daughter absolutely blew me away. This book is a must read! Thankfully the next book in this series is out in August. I'm so happy to have been lucky enough to have won a signed copy. Before anyone asks, no I will not be giving it away; this one is a keeper!

I\u2019ll break it down into the good, the bad, and the confusing.First off the good. The worldbuilding is one of the best, most fully developed, creative, and thoroughly cool that I have ever read in a paranormal book. Adult and YA combined. It\u2019s like a less harsh Kate Daniels world (incidentally they both take place in alternate Atlantas) with a Ghostbuster\u2019s twist. And the overall plot is engaging and surprising from start to finish with liberal sprinklings of great action scenes.Now for the bad. Where do I start? The writing itself is not great. I noticed this mostly with the dialogue which included a southern dialect for one character (stop with the dialects please!) and then with dialogue attribution. For example rarely to we see \u2018Riley said.\u2019 Instead she \u2018joked\u2019 or most annoyingly she \u2018quizzed\u2019. I vastly prefer \u2018said\u2019 or \u2018ask,\u2019 but maybe that\u2019s just me.And then there is the character of Riley herself. Wow I didn\u2019t like her most of the time. She comes off as extremely abrasive and antagonistic, which only emphasized how immature she was. Yes, she\u2019s had a hard life and it gets harder in THE DEMON TRAPPER\u2019S DAUGHTER, but she was a lot to take even in her best moments. Specifically her treatment of Beck, the former apprentice of her father. Riley used to have a huge crush on him and he quickly (and not harshly IMO) shot her down as she\u2019s significantly younger than he is. Now she treats him like something foul that she stepped in regardless of the many selfless and kind things he does for her. And the sort of confusing. Basically every other chapter is told from Beck\u2019s perspective and his chapters read like an adult novel, including some coarse sexual content and language that you don\u2019t find in YA. This switch up lent an overall disjointed feeling to the book.I\u2019m finding it extremely difficult to rate THE DEMON TRAPPER\u2019S DAUGHTER because there are some truly excellent 5bat worthy elements in this book, but when tempered by the shortcomings I mentioned above, it scrapes out 3bats. I am going to read the next book in the series in the hopes that both Riley and the writing improve enough to match the fantastic worldbuilding and plotting.Sexual Content: Kissing. References to sex. References to prostitution. References to rape. References to homosexuality. Sexual exploitation of a minor.

That's usually not something that \"makes\" a story for me, but I can't deny it held a certain appeal for me this time around. It's told in a duel perspective, one being Riley and the other Beck. That's not all that uncommon for ya, I love books told in duel perspectives... I think I've mentioned this several times before. But these characters couldn't be more different, and I don't just mean the age difference, so it made a for a distinct reading experience. Well, for me anyway... and this is my review right, so it's all about my opinion!The world that Oliver created was intense.... it's sort of freaked me out actually and yet the grittiness of it made it strangely fascinating. Like the whole reanimation thing... having these zombie slaves... how absolutely nefarious is that. Just digging someone up... doing a little black magic, and ta-da mindless mule. Absolutely nefarious yet at the same time it was intriguing. And I can't fail to mention the demons. I'm hoping that I won't be running into one of those things in a dark alley anytime soon... although I wouldn't mind having one of the smaller ones for a pet!Characterization was great. Riley although at times was inconsistent, I think that is what made her realistic. Especially at her age, I know I didn't know \"who I was\" when I was a teen, and I can't expect Riley to have it all figured out. Heck, if I'm being honest with myself, I still don't have clue. Well rounded and realistic... that's what I like. Beck was probably my favorite character of them all... he's got some issues, some \"real deep down, you're going to have to deal with that shit, before it messes you up big time\" issues. He's flawed, and that what I loved about him. I even Harper, the biggest asshole of all time, intrigued me.... and that is saying a lot. Usually I'd just be rooting for the guy to get his head eaten off of something.I'm really looking forward to reading the rest of the series, and getting a better understanding of the Guild itself... and figuring out the complete truth behind what Riley's dad was working on.... I know there's got to be more than what was touched on this time around.Demons, kicking-ass, cute boys.... yes please.

Oliver managed to provide plenty of detail and background without slowing the novel's pace down to a crawl. Thankfully, there weren't any spots within the novel that left me wondering when something was finally going to happen.Riley's story wouldn't be complete without a love interest... or two. I'll admit that I'm not the biggest fan of Simon... The only word I can use to describe him is 'blah.'

It\u2019s not precisely a post-apocalyptic setting, but it\u2019s a depressed one, with economic woes plaguing much of the population and demons living openly among humans. These aren\u2019t angsty, misunderstood demons either, but fiends from Hell; the small ones are nuisances and the big ones are deadly.Seventeen-year-old Riley Blackthorne is an apprentice demon trapper. Her father is himself a prominent trapper, which causes trouble for Riley on two fronts. Other trappers think she\u2019s trying to coast by on his name, and the demons hold grudges and would love to have a shot at Paul Blackthorne\u2019s daughter.The book begins with what\u2019s supposed to be an easy mission; Riley is assigned to trap a Biblio-Fiend, a low-level demon whose mayhem is limited to damaging books. Everything goes wrong, though, and this becomes the first indication that the demons aren\u2019t acting in the usual way. Demons always prowled alone, but now they\u2019re teaming up with other demons to pose a greater threat. Adding to the danger, the trappers\u2019 supply of Holy Water isn\u2019t working as well as it\u2019s supposed to. Trapping just became much more dangerous, and soon Riley has a family tragedy to deal with.The Demon Trapper\u2019s Daughter is a grimmer book than you might be expecting. There\u2019s a heartbreaking death, followed by grueling efforts to keep necromancers from stealing the body from the grave. And that\u2019s not to even mention the other destruction dished out by the demons\u2026Riley is an engaging heroine. She\u2019s in a stormy mood for most of the book, but she has plenty of reasons for that. She\u2019s stubborn, and sometimes too brave for her own good. She\u2019s exactly what a spirited \u201ceverygirl\u201d might be if placed in such a difficult situation. The other point-of-view character, Denver Beck, is harder to get a grip on. At times he\u2019s a great hero who\u2019d do anything for Riley. Other times he comes off as a bit of a pig; it\u2019s hard for me to like a character when he spends part of his first scene catcalling girls on the street. His dialogue is also written in a distracting accent. Despite a five-year age difference, I suspect he\u2019s being set up as Riley\u2019s eventual love interest (though she dates someone else in this installment). The plot is filled with tension and sadness, and occasionally a touch of humor. It\u2019s mainly driven by the mystery of the strange demon behavior and by Riley\u2019s everyday struggles to get by on a limited income and survive in the face of dangers. Riley has to worry about things like bills and replacing demon-damaged clothing, which lends a welcome dose of realism to the story.If you\u2019re looking for an action-filled YA urban fantasy, and want to read about a young girl in the process of becoming a butt-kicking heroine, The Demon Trapper\u2019s Daughter may be just what you\u2019re looking for.

Jana Oliver's spin on angels and demons is enjoyably unique and refreshingly creative. I loved every word...never read a character's POV from 3rd and 1st person before. How cool was that?!My heartfelt sorrow still bleeds for Riley Blackthorne, a demon trapper, whose will and determination seems to be put to the test, time and time again. She is strong and courageous--admirable characteristics in a 17-year-old teenage girl. Such qualities are often too rare in leading female MCs; most of my literary adventures in this particular genre do not portray the MCs in this manner. Thus, Riley is an oddity in that she kicks ass and is highly I.N.D.E.P.E.N.D.E.N.T! :=) I love everything about her - despite the MANY trials and tribulations she has faced in this series opener. All the tears she shed...I felt them all.Riley and Simon - eehhh? I get it, alright, but uhhh, I don't think this is where she belongs. He's cute, devout and loving. BUT, I don't believe that's where her heart is...I'll leave it at that.Riley and Beck - awwh damn! Jana -- you better tie this love story up! Hahaah! Puh-leeeze...lol! Beck is so FIONE! OMG! Every word he said...that southern drawl...ya'll better read this to get why he's got me all hot and bothered. Southern style, mister & missus...yes m'aam! Give me some more of that! Ohh-kay...Beck was the reason I kept turning the pages. There, I said it. Ori--hmmm, I think I have a sneaky suspicion of what he truly is, but I won't spoil it here.

So, it took me a while to finish this book. Why? Because it was kind of slow paced. You would have thought a book about demon trapping would be actionpacked to the maximum, right? Well, it wasn't. But that doesn't mean it wasn't a good book.The setting is really cool! Welcome to Atlanta, year 2018. Demons are out in the open.Riley Blackthorn is the daughter of a master trapper, and she wants to be a trapper too. Problem is; she's a girl. And the demons are up to something big.I really enjoyed this book. Mostly because of the world, and the setting. Also, i loved the demons! Haha. The little ninja ones, at least. I thought the demon level-thing was pretty cool too. And the spheres! The characers were okay. I'm not sure I liked Riley too much. I wanted her to be more kick-ass. I mean, she's a demon trapper! But she's only seventeen, and new in the game, plus she's been through a lot. Oh well, now there's a lot of room for her to grow, and develop in the next book! So I hope, and think, she'll be more kick-ass in the next one. Oh, and she was funny! I mean. \"Asshats\", hahah.I did however really really like Beck! He was mighty fine ya'll (haha).The love-interest I didn't really like too much.. The relationship between him and Riley was SO rushed. They were together after seeing each other, like what, two or three times? Ugh. I hate it when relationships are rushed like that.Also, there's a lot of unanswered questions after this book. I feel like there should have been more answers. I'm kind of like \"Uh. That didn't make sense at all\". And I was waiting for it to be cleared up.. Hm. Well. The ending was great! The whole book sort of built up to that ending, so we could see that the real stuff is going to happen in the next book. So I'm definitly going to read it as soon as I can.

It may sound glamorous, but trapping demons is not as easy-peasy as the popular TV show Demonland might lead you to believe.One: It\u2019s extremely dangerous. Even a level one demon can wreak havoc. A level three demon would like nothing more than to have you as its next meal. And forget about the risk in facing a level five. It would almost be less risky to sell your soul to Lucifer than to battle one of them.Two: It\u2019s disgustingly messy. And the smell\u2026ugh. You don\u2019t want to know the number of times a Trapper gets peed on. And when you catch these guys, someone has to clean their cages. Not the world\u2019s most pleasant task considering a demon will eat almost anything.Three: It doesn\u2019t pay as well as you might think. Unless of course you skip the proper channels and sell your demons to the highest bidder. But what upstanding Trapper would want to do that?But when your father is Paul Blackthorne, a Master Demon Trapper who comes from a long line of Demon Trappers, it is only natural to want to stick with tradition, even if you are a girl. The only girl in Atlanta\u2019s Demon Trapper\u2019s Guild, as a matter of fact.What could be more awesome than learning from the very best and working for a Guild whose unofficial slogan is: \u201cKicking Hell\u2019s Ass One Demon at a Time\u201d? Nothing that Riley Blackthorne can think of.In a city more overrun with demons than ever before and money running tight, Riley wants to help out, even if it means being an apprentice and getting hassled far more than a seventeen-year-old male Trapper would.But when her first solo job goes terribly wrong, will she be able to remain in the Guild? And even if they do allow her to stay, if she has disappointed or embarrassed her father, should she?***The Demon Trapper\u2019s Daughter is not your typical young adult angels and demons story. There is no devastatingly handsome demon battling an even more attractive angel for Riley Blackthorne\u2019s affection. These demons, for the most part, are truly the vile, unpleasant creatures traditionally thought of when thinking \u201cdemon.\u201dAnd this is not a sweet, heartbreaking story of unrequited love or one involving a love triangle where the heroine is forced to choose who she loves more. This story is gritty and edgy and does not sugarcoat or pull any punches. The heroine, Riley, is not indecisive or weak. She is smart, tough, impulsive, cynical and strong-willed, but very believable, sympathetic and likable.Author Jana Oliver has written a book that is original and gripping. There are no stories out there in this genre that take this approach to the subject and do it so well.Throughout the story the author hints at a number of things that aren\u2019t quite right, things that just feel wrong, keeping Riley in the dark and readers at the threshold of getting questions answered, but not allowing them beyond. At least not in this first book which makes this one of those \u201con-the-edge-of-your-seat\u201d reads. (Book two in the series is eagerly awaited.)Ms. Oliver fills out this story with such an attention to detail that it gives readers a real sense of the environment in 2018 Atlanta and a definite grasp on who her main characters are and what drives them.This book is a \u201cmust read\u201d in February for readers looking for a story with a lot of personality and a bit of a hard edge.On a personal note:I didn\u2019t think it would be possible for me to like one more YA novel with an angels and demons theme. I was utterly wrong. The Demon Trapper\u2019s Daughter completely blew me away.From the very first lines of the book, I already knew I loved Riley (and Jana Oliver) and her wry sense of humor and sardonic attitude. \u201cLibraries and demons,\u201d she muttered. \u201cWhat is the attraction?\u201dRiley Blackthorne is as stubborn as they come, but she is also determined and courageous. Her priorities, right or wrong, are set and nothing will stop her. She is not sidelined by any of the tragedies thrown her way. She just picks herself up, dusts herself off and keeps on moving when even the strongest of men might cave. She is definitely a kick-a character.I also loved the fact that this book was a lot edgier than most of the other YA books out there and that Riley did not spend any time pining over a guy \u2013 although I don\u2019t think we yet know the full extent of the bad blood between her and Den Beck.And lines like these (from the mind of Denver Beck) are why this author is so freakin\u2019 fantastic: This was a battle he had to win. If not, Hell would have the last word.Of course it has to be mentioned: the cover art on the American edition is simply amazing. Riley perched on the edge of a building holding that sphere reminds me so much of the opening shot in the movie Underworld where Kate Beckinsale is posed in similar fashion on top of a building overlooking the city. (The most memorable \u2013 and my favorite \u2013 scene in the entire film.)"}, {"userName": "Yan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1350957-yan", "userReview": "\u201cIt\u2019s the year 2018, and with human society seriously disrupted by the economic upheavals of the previous decade, Lucifer has increased the number of demons in all major cities. Fortunately, humans are protected by trappers, who work to keep homes and streets safe from the things that go bump in the night.\u201dThe Demon Trapper\u2019s Daughter was a heart pounding, adrenaline kicking novel that tried too much as the first book in the series. This dystopian world is caused by the economic downturns of countries. The price of gas is a hundred or so dollars per gallon. \u201cWith the ridiculous cost of gas even horses made sense now\u201d (18, ARC). Yet if that is true and people are stealing traffic lights and \u201csold for scrap metal thieves\u201d (18) then why is it, and how is it, possible that the demon trappers own cars. Like I think almost every one demon trapper that I\u2019ve come across in the novel has a car. And then they bitch about being broke. My recommended solution: walk, ride a bike, get a freaking horse since it makes sense now. If the trapper is using an automobile to store the demons in, carpool. Trappers pair up when they hunt so this isn\u2019t too far of a stretch.Riley is from a long line of demon trappers [not hunters, as hunters think all demons are evil and must be killed whereas trappers merely trap demons, and sell them to get them \u201cpurified\u201d]. She\u2019s\u2014what 16, 17?\u2014years old with a smoking body, because we get inner monologues and talks about how pretty she is. I got it, so thanks. She\u2019s also really kick-ass for an apprentice nabbing a level 3 class demon when she\u2019s only allowed to trap a level one. But Riley does get beaten up in these fights and nearly dies at one point. Riley is stubborn and sees very little outside of her own little world. The Demon Trapper\u2019s Daughter offers readers realistic fighting scenes where the good guys get beaten, bruised and bloody. And the possibility death is ever constant.This is VERY SLIGHT SPOILER so I would advise you to skip this paragraph if you hate spoilers of any kind. Death is a very real thing in The Demon Trapper\u2019s Daughter where one character\u2019s death creates a ripple effect in the trapping world, specifically affecting Riley the most. However, my preference to the way the character\u2019s death is handled is less snark, more grief. A sentence describing the way Riley was in bed for such and such days isn\u2019t effective in drawing out sympathy from the readers especially when the very next scene has Riley a little pissed of for causing her so much trouble. Whatever, it bothered me when I was reading it.The Demon Trapper\u2019s Daughter is told in two third-person perspective which is good and bad. Bad because one of them annoyed me. It was very repetitive and tiring after a while. Good because it gave a different point of view and set of opinions to the same scene. It also allowed two different reactions and coping mechanisms in regards to the character\u2019s death.In the novel each demon is categorized by their size, power, and attributes. Oliver does a great job of describing and separating each demon into subclasses and ways to fight them. Yet my problem is where did these demons come from? When did they first appear on Earth? Have they always been there? Have demon trappers existed as long as demons have existed? I\u2019m curious about the over trappers in the world and if there are any aside from Rome. The Demon Trapper\u2019s Daughter has a set-up for a potential love square. SQUARE! It might be a triangle, or it might be a couple, but it can definitely go anywhere at this point. I clenched my jaw when one kept popping up after another.Oliver keeps bringing up more questions to the world and another plotline before the previous question was answered. The world building was iffy, but the action top-notch. I found myself having to read the sequel to The Demon Trapper\u2019s Daughter rather than wanting to read the sequel because it interested me so much. While I say that there is a big chance I will not continue with the series."}, {"userName": "Peep (Pop!

I have the other cover...----------------------------I didn't really like Riley. She was whiny and very, very self-centered. Her world revolved around her and that was that. And we had to read her thoughts a lot. Really, we did I didn't find her grief period very believable. Oh, and remember how she treated Tim? That was so wrong. Though, in Riley's defense, it was a dumb question. How could you not know what a Biblio demon was? Or, at least have an idea! I have a bunch of problems with this one. And I hope you're listening.I think there was just too much information at times and not enough information at other times. Sometimes that annoys me. Like, I would've liked to know more about Atlanta and why things changed. Was it like modern times for us, then the world went to, you know, Hell? Or, were there always demons around and they just got bumped up? Why let the demons live? Why don't the trappers know more about what happens with the demons after they are sold? Why weren't humans more afraid of them? Why was Harper allowed to get away with so much?? Whatever happened to majority ruled? And lastly, why does she want to be a trapper so bad?If gas was so high that only the rich people drove, how could Riley and a lot of other people afford to drive so freely? Especially when you are living from trap to trap. Maybe I missed the paragraph on alternative fuel sources? Admittedly, I do have an ARC so things might be clarified/nixed in the final version. Reading Beck's literal pronunciation of words made my eye twitch after a while. I had the southern voice going in my head but man, every time I had to say \"Yer\", I said it in some old southern crooners voice that sounded like he was about to sing a country song. Totally messed up my mental image of Beck, certainly nowhere near hot. I sound like such a hater!The parts I really liked were the creepy action parts. Though at times I questioned the \"Master\" level of the trappers. Maybe they were so used to their jobs and that's why they didn't pull out the big guns when they first encounter demons?? I mean, if you know the white sphere will stop a Pyro-fiend, why not just throw it from the beginning I know, right?? Demon trapped, end of story. I actually really liked most of the demons. I know that they came off as the bad guys, but I couldn't help but wonder if I would have donated to a Save the Demons fund. Or, donated a sweater. Think about it, some of them seemed like they were going to be good. Remember the water hose scene? And really, tell me I wasn't the only one who liked the Klepto demon? My Sparklies!I am not sure how many books will be in this series but I do know that very few questions are answered in book 1. You HAVE to read the next book to get anywhere. Personally, I felt like this one read like one huge prequel. Which might not be bad for some, but you know how I feel about series. And love triangles. Grrrrrrr. Really?! Why? Why? Why? And her and her boyfriend made me think she was 12, not the undetermined age that she is throughout the book. Love? Really?!  Every time she said boyfriend, I cringed.To be honest I am quite torn about this one. It definitely didn't meet my expectations but I really believe that this is a book that other readers will love. Some people might like Riley. But not me. I did like that it picked up near the end, but as i mentioned earlier, the balance of details could have used more work. It's definitely something for young adults as there is bad language, implied package size, sleazy pron store and owner, demon violence, etc, etc, etc. I think I made that sound worse than it is. Read it and let me know what you think, ok?P.S. It was nice to see that even during the Demon apocalypse, McD's is still around. Which is great because I'll be needing my sweet tea fix.

F\u00fcr gew\u00f6hnlich arbeiten D\u00e4monen nicht zusammen. Und sie wussten auch, wer Riley ist, obwohl f\u00fcr sie eigentlich alle Menschen gleich aussehen ...Meinung:Gibt es zu diesem Buch irgendwie zwei Cover? Es gibt ja ein mal das auf dem Bild und dann noch ein anderes, rotes (hier), das zu den anderen Covern passt. Was auch immer man tut, der erste Band passt nicht zu den Fortsetzungen, entweder wegen dem Cover oder wegen dem Format.Riley Blackthorne ist die einzige weibliche D\u00e4monenf\u00e4ngerin ihrer Zunft. Wenn sie also einen Fehler macht, schieben die Meister es oft auf die Tatsache, dass sie ein M\u00e4dchen ist. Das ist nat\u00fcrlich total sexistisch und ungerecht. Die D\u00e4monen scheinen es Riley auch noch extra schwer machen zu wollen, als wer der Job nicht ohnehin schon schwer genug. Ich mochte das M\u00e4dchen wirklich gerne, weil sie stark und selbstbewusst ist, weil sie alles versucht, um ihre Ziele zu erreichen, und weil sie niemals aufgibt, solange noch ein Funken Hoffnung besteht.Ich mochte auch Beck ganz gerne. Er ist der Sch\u00fcler von Rileys Vater und weil sie mal in ihn verliebt war, aber er sie f\u00fcr zu jung hielt, ist sie jetzt nicht gut auf ihn zu sprechen. Aus Riley Sicht k\u00f6nnte man denken, dass er eingebildet ist, aber aus seiner Sicht wirkt er wirklich nett. Er gibt sich viel M\u00fche mit Riley, aber dann sagt er eine falsche Sache und macht alles wieder kaputt :) Er ist wirklich ein verantwortungsvoller Kerl und nicht so wie nervig und arrogant wie Riley ihn sieht.Simon, den gl\u00e4ubigen Sch\u00fcler des gemeinsten Meisters der Zunft, fand ich wirklich s\u00fc\u00df. Riley beschreibt ihn, als w\u00e4re er ein Engel, und weil er so niedlich gl\u00e4ubig ist, dass es mich zum Lachen bringt, und dass er durch nichts aus der Ruhe zu bringen ist, gefiel mir. Er wirkt wie jemand, der seinen Platz in der Welt gefunden hat und immer wei\u00df, was zu tun ist. Ich mochte ihn echt gerne.Die Geschichte fand ich auch gelungen. Aber geh\u00f6rt dieses Buch eher zu Fantasy, Science Fiction oder eher zu den Dytopien? Oder zu allen Dreien?Ein bisschen seltsam fand ich, dass Riley sich kaum Sorgen gemacht hat, weil die D\u00e4monen ihren Namen kennen. Wenn solche Abweichungen von der Regel in B\u00fcchern vorkommen, spielt das immer eine besonders wichtige Rolle. Die Anderen hat das mehr besch\u00e4ftigt als sie selbst, aber das ist in B\u00fcchern ja oft so. Selbst wenn sie versucht h\u00e4tte, mehr zu erfahren, w\u00e4re ihr das wohl nicht gelungen ;)Fazit:Es war wirklich sehr spannend und auch humorvoll, dazu kam noch eine Portion Romantik und die Mischung ist wirklich gelungen.

It is a refreshing change to YA books which are full of vampires and shape shifters. Jana Oliver has created a fantastic world where demons run wild and it is up to trappers like Riley and Beck to help rid to world of their evil. A mix of religion, magic and reanimation; 'Forsaken' is an amazing story with so many unknown areas to be explored, especially when it comes to trapping and hunting. But it's not just demons that are causing trouble; questions to do with meddling angels and uncovering the mystery of the holy water problems still need to be solved.I love how different, and yet familiar, the demon trapping is. It's hard not to think of 'Supernatural' when demons are mentioned (especially with all the hype around 'Demonland', the demon hunting TV show in Oliver's story). But Oliver's trappers don't have the luxury of fancy cars and easy kills. For them, trapping is a dangerous occupation that can leave so much sadness in its wake. It's hard not to feel sorry for Riley. She keeps being put through tests. Testing her position as a trapper in the Guild and testing her ability to handle pain and sadness surrounding friends and family. I think she's an incredibly strong leading lady; who manages tears, laughter and love on a daily basis, as well as juggling mundane human activities (like shopping for clothes and going to school) with the life of a trapper. It can't be easy, but she's pulling through, one step at a time. I love that we get to see the world of demon trapping through both Riley and Beck's eyes. The changing perspectives keep the story interesting and full of action, but also give you the chance to be in 2 places at once. Beck and Riley work so well together, can't wait to see more of their interactions. In most books there's always a few fabulous guys to fall for, and this one is no different with 3 guys to look out for: Beck, Simon and Ori; all with their own appeals. My personal favourite is Beck, he's amazing; definitely high on my list of book-crushes. There aren't many young guys who would look after a friend's daughter, even when they're not always welcome; not to mention that he seems to be interested in more than just looking after a friend. Fantastic book. Can't wait to see what happens next.5/5 stars"}, {"userName": "Mimi Valentine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6110599-mimi-valentine", "userReview": "Rating: 3.5 starsWhen a book is called The Demon Trapper's Daughter, you know you're in for one heck of a ride \u2014 and that's exactly what this novel delivered! It was a roller coaster with its ups and downs and pros and cons, but I still enjoyed reading it a lot! :)The thing I loved most about this book (besides its super-cool cover, of course!) would be the world. Jana Oliver created such an original world of demons, trappers, hunters, and magic. It was gritty and dark, intense and different, and oh-so fascinating! This setting was one that made you want to lock yourself inside it!I don't have much to say about the characters other than that I LOVED them. Even with everything going on, Jana Oliver didn't make them perfect or superior at what they did, and that made them so much easier to connect with! I adored Riley through and through, and the rest of the cast was always interesting to read about.(And I'm totally Team Beck (\u2665), even though his constant use of \"ya\" and \"yer\" was strange at times!

Mostly, my 3's are either 2.5 or 3.5 that I round up or down depending on my mood.The first half of the book reads too much like bad paranormal YA. Whiny protagonist drooling over every guy in sight, but completely oblivious to the fact that they all think she's hot. Extremely high levels of angst leading to incredibly stupid decisions. And, of course, let's not forget things like a potential love triangle and a special destiny.However, I have to say that the book got better during the second half acquiring a more regular UF vibe. Despite the beginning, the love part of the plot got more or less settled quickly (at least until the next book) and without any dramatics. The special destiny played a part in the events but it wasn't all important; there were problems everywhere and solving them was a team effort. Also, there was no need to make the \"ultimate choice\" or any of those \"ultimate\" things that other paranormal YA authors seem so fond of.The ending set up a rather ambitious premise. It sounds interesting, but setting those \"fate of the world\" arcs can blow up in your face unless is handled with extreme care.Let's see what happens next. For the moment, I'm in."}, {"userName": "DayDreamer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4302934-daydreamer", "userReview": "Hands up who wants to slap Riley to get her to stop complaining on every page? Why does she hate Beck so much? What the hell has he done? She is so pathetic with her little talking in her head on every other page. Shut up Riley. God, if I was a girl in there, I'd give her a good old fashioned kick up the butt. Again, she has all the boys after her - what a shocker for today's teen fiction/fantasy. To be honest, like with all the other love triangles and squares and stuff - she really has nothing going for her apart from her looks. I have no idea why all the guys are lusting over a stubborn, bossy female. NO. That does not make a strong female. It makes her weak and naive. However it was really well written and kept me page turning. I see why the author wrote this in third person because you'd have to be a masochistic person to want to be in Riley's head throughout the whole book. I loved Beck's parts. Again, like with so many other books, it's the hot and popular guys that are always in pain and get treated like crap by supposedly strong females: Jace, Beck, Keenan... and so on.It's the same old story set in another world. If anyone can recommend me a young adult fantasy book that does NOT have a girl who has about ten boys after her (or even flitting between two, for that matter), then I'd like to know."}, {"userName": "Becca", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5116879-becca", "userReview": "Is this book on your TBR list??? If not, stop reading and add it.... 2011 has brought some really fantastic new series into my little corner of the reading world. I've gotten a taste of Nightshade, Stork, Wither, Iron Thorn - with many still on the too read list - I can't say this new series by Jana Oliver is the best of the year. But it's going to be up there!!! Set in 2018, the beautiful shinning city of Atlanta, many of us love, is unrecognizable. Hell has released scores of demons and 17yo Riley Blackthorne is in the middle of this strange new future. She's head-strong, stubborn, funny, caring and trying so hard to prove herself in a very traditional all-male guild. What a fun MC she is and the men in her life; her father (a legendary master trapper), Beck (his trainee/journeyman/previously crushworthy), Harper (the asshat in the guild), Simon (Harper's trainee/cutie) are perfect foils for her story.I'm not comparing this book to VA or Hunger Games as the worlds are so different; but if you appreciate the strong, female leads captured by Mead & Collins, then you must give this new series a read-through."}], "description": "Riley Blackthorne just needs a chance to prove herself \u2013 and that\u2019s exactly what the demons are counting on\u2026 Seventeen-year-old Riley, the only daughter of legendary demon trapper Paul Blackthorne, has always dreamed of following in her father's footsteps.\u00a0 The good news is, with human society seriously disrupted by economic upheaval and Lucifer increasing the number of demons in all major cities, Atlanta\u2019s local Trappers Guild needs all the help they can get \u2013 even from a girl.
