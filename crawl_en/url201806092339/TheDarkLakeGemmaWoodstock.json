Even back then, she was a mystery that I wanted to solve.\"I know my rating doesn't fully convey it, but I really did think this was a solid debut. As an avid reader of mysteries and crime fiction, it's getting insanely difficult to blow me away in this genre, which makes it harder to find those 5 star poppers that are memorable long term.\u00a0The Dark Lake\u00a0was a complex story, as there was a plot driven case pertaining to this particular installment of the new series, plus heavy characterization regarding our main character Gemma and her personal life, past and present. The structure of the book was on point; I really enjoyed the way this was told and how varied the information was that we received. I only had a few specific issues with the novel, but I felt they were large enough to warrant rounding my rating down rather than up.\"These violent delights have violent endsAnd in their triumph die, like fire and powder,Which as they kiss consume.\"- William Shakespeare, Romeo and Juliet, Act II: Scene VII feel like there are so many aspects of this story I can't discuss here for fear of minor spoilers more than the major ones. One of the best parts of this book were all the tiny AHA moments that came about rather than the whodunnit at the end. As I read I felt I was rating it as two separate books; the police procedural and the atmospheric character development. When it comes to the procedural, I felt it was just ok. It wasn't bad by any means, but it felt a bit standard and underwhelming. I will say I was somewhat taken aback by the who in one of the final scenes; it had crossed my mind at one point but the author managed to help me forget about my suspicions until it was revealed in the end, which was a nice experience. I did feel the stronger part of the story was the personal side, our introduction and courting of Gemma and finding out about many of her issues and faults. It's no secret that I'm attracted to damaged, flawed female leads, especially those in law enforcement, and she clearly fits the bill and wears it well. Gemma is definitely not a likable character, but she is by far intriguing to read about and made me want to continue along even though I wasn't crazy about the plot based drama.I'll be honest, there's a whole lot going on here; between the present day case, Gemma's personal life in the past and also in the present, some readers may feel it's a bit too much to follow and cost them from wholly investing. Personally, I found it was fine to connect with all of this happening and felt it necessary to give us backstory and set the stage for future Gemma Woodstock novels. While I did have my issues, the author managed to completely hook me in a way that makes me desperate to find out where Gemma's personal life will take us. Off the top of my head, I can't really think of a series to compare this to, but it definitely had that wonderful vibe of UK crime fiction (although I know this one was not set there). As a current Book Of The Month choice for October, I can see why many folks are raving about it as a debut and why it was chosen for the subscription. The quality of writing was on par with many bestselling thrillers of late and I'm giddy to see where Bailey's potential takes her, and us.*Many thanks to the publisher for providing my copy via NetGalley.Blog | Twitter | Instagram"}, {"userName": "Meredith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30978160-meredith", "userReview": "Psychological thriller about a cop investigating the murder of her high school rival.\nWhen 28 year old English teacher Rosalind (Rose) is found dead, the people of the small Australian town of Smithson are in shock. Why would someone kill beautiful Rose? She is the girl who seemed to have it all: beauty, money, and success. Rose had the type of charisma where she was able to compel the women around her to want to be like her, and the men to fall in love with her. While some fell hard for Rose, others believed that she was a manipulative bitch, including the cop who is investigating her murder, Gemma Woodstock. Gemma\u2019s personal connection to Rose takes the story to another level, and it becomes more about Gemma\u2019s character and less about who killed beautiful Rose.While Gemma and Rose went to highschool together, they were never friends; it was more like Gemma was obsessed with Rose, which turns dangerous when Rose starts dating the love of Gemma\u2019s life, Jacob. What makes things even more complex is that Jacob committed suicide. Gemma never fully recovered from his death, and the reader slowly learns how his connection to Rose drove Gemma over the edge. The mystery takes a backseat to Gemma\u2019s personal life. A good chunk of the book focuses on Gemma\u2019s affair with her partner, Felix, as well as her relationship with Jacob. Her current boyfriend, Scott, hasn\u2019t a clue about Gemma\u2019s secret life, even though Gemma is quite distant and treats him like garbage. I feel like too much was going on in The Dark Lake--it was almost as if the book was fighting itself. 98% of the book was told from Gemma\u2019s POV, but then there were brief chapters thrown in from various people in Smithson that didn\u2019t seem to serve much of purpose. Gemma\u2019s character was irksome, and I felt no sympathy for her. I didn't care for her, but my feelings about her didn\u2019t influence my feelings about the book. I also thought that the ending was a let down, and Gemma finally realizing everything that she had in life but was too blind to see it was a bit of a cliche. The Dark Lake is not a bad read, it\u2019s just not an amazing one.

It's a place where everyone knows everyone, yet is still full of secrets that come to be slowly revealed. The town is shocked when 28 year old Rosalind Ryan, a drama teacher, is discovered strangled in the lake, with roses surrounding her. Gemma is the main homicide detective, aided by her police partner, Felix. She is a mother, with a young son, Ben, and a partner who loves her, but whom she treats abominably. To be frank, her personal life is a car crash, she is having an affair with Felix, and obsesses over him interminably. In this character driven novel, the past comes back to haunt Gemma, and the past is where the answers to Rosalind's murder lie. This is a story of love, loss, grief, deception, secrets and tragedy, in a narrative that moves back and forth in time. The story is related primarily through Gemma's perspective.This is a case that threatens the unravelling of Gemma, for she knew Rosalind from school. Rosalind was the charismatic, beautiful and popular girl, whom everyone adored and loved, although some, like Gemma, harboured darker thoughts of her. Gemma is a conflicted woman, she loved Jacob as a teenager, but he was seeing Rosalind. Jacob goes on to commit suicide, and Gemma has never gotten over that loss. Gemma's obsession with Rosalind in the past spills over to the present. In the meantime, Rosalind is an elusive character to get a hold of and there are a number of odd factors. Whilst being liked, she has no close friends. Her father is one of the richest people in town, yet Rosalind resides in a squalid home, but has expensive tastes, liked to drink and was taking medication for depression and anxiety. There are a host of suspects with motives, and Gemma investigates as secrets begin to tumble out.This is a slow paced, multilayered read that is more about Gemma than Rosalind's murder. Admittedly, Gemma is a hard woman to like, irritating, deeply flawed and psychologically teetering all over the place with her haunted past. There are strong undertones of Romeo and Juliet to story, strengthened by the fact that Rosalind had been working on a reinterpretation of the play at school. It is a character driven tale, with elements of suspense and tension. I found it an entertaining read, with beautifully written prose.

The case is assigned to Detective Gemma Woodstock who attended high school with the victim and who has an entangled past with her. This is where the story begins and slowly what happened is revealed.This psychological thriller is narrated -mainly- from the point of view of Gemma but also in smaller degrees from other characters. Gemma is a flawed human with very good detective instincts and the timeline alternates between the present and flashbacks.The setting is well constructed, it takes place around Christmas time in the sizzling, hot Aussie summers. For those of us who live well-above the equator, Christmas time is associated with cold winters and the author's descriptions kept reminding me of the different setting, I felt I was there and loved it. The book has about 440 pages and at some points I felt it was longer than it should be, some paragraphs or chapters could have been left out, but this is my personal taste as I have a preference for shorter books.Overall I enjoyed this thriller and recommend it to all those who love a good mystery.

Set in a small country town, where everyone knows everyone and their past histories, there are still long kept secrets hidden away. When a beautiful young drama teacher, Rosalind Ryan is found dead in the lake behind the high school, DS Gemma Woodstock must face up to her own past and her history with the dead woman.Gemma's personal life is a bit of a mess, she hasn't emotionally comitteed to her partner Scott, doesn't spend enough time with their young son and is having an affair with her police partner, Felix. She's a complex character and not particularly likeable, but she is a tenacious policewoman. She doesn't understand why Rosalind has returned to their small town after leaving school for University in the city. She seems to live very frugally and has no real friends, but is loved by her pupils and has just staged a successful modernised version of Romeo and Juliet. So who would want to kill her?The story unravels slowly, with Gemma looking back to her time in high school with the talented and beautiful Rosalind and her unresolved feelings around the death of her boyfriend Jacob, as she tries to solve Rosalind's murder. The slow unravelling of the story allows the characters to develop nicely, so we get a good feel of who they are. The town is well depicted as a small, insular Aussie rural town in the midst of a hot summer with the dark lake brooding at the heart of it, both in the past and the present.

It fulfills all my criteria for a great book: exquisite writing, fully-developed characters, and a fleshed out, well-paced plot. Sarah Bailey\u2019s The Dark Lake is simply fantastic. So good that I can say with confidence that we might be experiencing the beginning work of Australia\u2019s equivalent to Tana French or Gillian Flynn. An author who will continue to produce increasingly masterful narratives for years to come.\u201cSo much happened that summer. It lives on inside me somehow, writhing around like a living beast.\u201dA police investigator in a small Australian town, Detective Sergeant Gemma Woodstock is shocked when she\u2019s called to investigate the murder of a high school classmate. But not just any classmate--it\u2019s the charming, enigmatic Rosalind (Rose) Ryan. Found strangled, battered then dumped in a nearby lake, flowers adorning her body, Rose is as mysterious in death as she was in life. Ethereally beautiful and liked by all, no obvious suspects or motive exist. Gemma, haunted by past demons, is immediately drawn to the case. As prior and present converge, Rose and Gemma\u2019s lives become increasingly entwined. Old tragedies re-emerge, ripping open barely healed wounds. It seems Rosalind\u2019s death may just destroy Gemma\u2019s life. The Dark Lake\u2019s twisty, grim plot benefits greatly from Sarah Bailey\u2019s extraordinary writing skills. Ms. Bailey doesn\u2019t just invent characters, she brings them to life. Every role, no matter the significance, is fully explored. From the jogger who discovers Rose\u2019s body to the owner of Gemma\u2019s favorite breakfast spot, Sarah Bailey spares no expense. All are brilliantly-wrought and developed. And by giving voice to what are essentially \u201cextras,\u201d more prominent characters are allowed to flourish. The reader is granted the ability to see the protagonists from all possible angles, creating a richer narrative. \u201cRosalind\u2019s death has formed a blanket over Smithson: mixing with the relentless heat, it\u2019s a creeping, vapour-like cover that sticks to everything. Voices are low and theories are exchanged in clusters outside the newsagent.\u201dThe writing itself--the prose--is a pleasure to consume. The Dark Lake\u2019s imagery is vivid and setting so real that the reader is immediately enveloped into Gemma\u2019s world. And Gemma\u2019s world is\u2026.complicated.A successful police detective in her late-20s, Gemma relishes the hunt. The puzzle-solving necessary to crack a case. Rosalind Ryan\u2019s murder offers a particular challenge, but Gemma\u2019s history with the victim unsettles the generally unflappable investigator. Rose\u2019s memory drives Gemma to re-live tragic events she\u2019s worked years to forget. An affair with her married partner similarly complicates the situation. Gemma\u2019s life rapidly unravels exposing ghosts better left buried. While her vibrant characterization pulls readers into a progressively deteriorating mind. \u201cThese violent delights have violent ends\u201dRosalind Ryan is shrouded in enigma. Even in high school, Rose \u201cwas a mystery [Gemma] wanted to solve.\u201d Gifted with \u201cDisney princess beauty,\u201d Rose became a popular drama teacher at Gemma\u2019s former alma mater. After her much-lauded Romeo & Juliet-based school play, it appears Rose was lured to Sonny Lake where she met her horrific fate. But why? In addition to being beautiful, Rose was universally admired. No ready motive exists, yet Gemma knows this was no random attack. \u201cThe longer I am in this job, the more I realize that the lines between love and hate and life and death are blurry\u201dAs the case intensifies, Gemma learns that Rose\u2019s life was full of contradiction. The daughter of the richest man in town, Rose lives in a tiny, somewhat squalid cottage. Yet in the cottage, Gemma discovers thousands of dollars spent on pricey wine and beauty products. Rose is described as friendly and popular by all, but has no close friends. She\u2019s exquisitely beautiful, though single. Rose had it all and still drank heavily and took antidepressants and anxiety medication. Nothing fits. And the more Gemma tries to pin down Rose--gain some insight into her life--the further she slips away.  The Dark Lake is the definition of a character-driven mystery. Gemma\u2019s varied issues and history not only directly connect to the central mystery, they enhance the overall storyline. And Rose remains a haunting figure throughout. No passage seems pointless or wasted. Sarah Bailey has designed everything to perfection. The only reason The Dark Lake didn\u2019t merit five stars is I was able to accurately predict the \u201cwhodunnit\u201d about halfway through the book.

I was impressed by the amount of positive endorsement this book has received and encouraged my resolve to select The Dark Lake to read.In the sleepy country town of Smithson not a great deal happens. When local teacher Rosalind Ryan is found dead floating in the waters of a local lake, surrounded by red roses, tensions in the small town run high. It is up to Smithson\u2019s rising star and local, Detective Sergeant Gemma Woodstock to help solve this tragic murder case. Problem is, Gemma is trying her hardest to withhold a pertinent secret in connection to this case. Gemma and Rosalind have a dubious high school history together. The resulting investigation into this revered local teacher\u2019s death opens up a pandora\u2019s box of secrets not only related to the victim but the town itself and residents of Smithson. It is up to Detective Gemma Woodstock to reveal the truth behind the murder at the lake while keeping her personal life in check at the same time.If you are looking for quality Australian crime fiction that will hypnotize you from the start to finish, then The Dark Lake would be an ideal choice. I was enthralled by the central murder mystery, captivated by the characters and taken aback by the rich Australian based setting. In addition, what Bailey excels in is her portrayal of the police work involved in murder case. The level of detail and descriptions related to the nitty gritty of a murder investigation was fine tuned and really made this crime novel stand out from the crowd.For a debut writer, Bailey demonstrates accomplished character delivery. From the local teacher and victim Rosalind, to the detective in charge of the case, Gemma Woodstock, the characterisation is always full bodied. Gemma, our leading lady, is our focal narrator. With the majority of the novel told from Gemma\u2019s point of view, it is easy to develop a strong level of empathy for this particular character. Gemma is a complex and layered character, her personal life is a mess but this makes her all the more interesting to the audience. There is a strong touch of realism to Gemma, she isn\u2019t perfect and her mistakes both in her career and personal life makes her completely human. Supporting Gemma is a great set of local figures, from Gemma\u2019s secret lover Felix, Gemma\u2019s father, her investigative team at work and a medical examiner. Coupled with the local residents and potential suspects to Rosalind\u2019s murder, Bailey has covered all bases character wise.With a robust setting that drips with tension throughout, I was impressed by this first time author\u2019s ability to convey her locale with precision. As the bulk of the action in The Dark Lake occurs during a long and particularly hot drawn out summer, I was easily able to envisage the heat, sweat and exhaustion of Smithson. I\u2019m a fan of books based in rural Australian settings and Bailey does this specific setting justice. She is also able to project the intricacies of living in a small town, how people live in each other\u2019s hip pockets but at the same time are able to keep big secrets from one another. When these secrets are revealed they have the power to shock and rattle the existence of a small community, as Bailey demonstrates in The Dark Lake.The Dark Lake meanders along at a slow and steady beat, aided by the clear timeline of events headed in each new chapter. Plenty of time in the narrative is devoted to setting the scene, developing characters and their motivations. A bountiful supply of potential suspects and possible outcomes to Rosalind\u2019s murder are explored. I know I had absolutely no inclination as to the circumstances of the murder until the final reveal. I think this is indicative of Bailey\u2019s skill as a crime writer, to keep you guessing and keep you very much engaged in the unfolding mystery until the final hour.In delivering my final word on this addictive new Australian crime thriller, I have nothing but praise to deliver and little to fault. The Dark Lake is a mystifying and pensive tale, choosing to reveal is deep seated secrets when it is good and ready. Layered and composite characters, an astute central mystery and a staunch Australian setting make this novel a noteworthy addition to the crime fiction field.

The author has created a flawed and complex character in Gemma, the lead homicide detective. The tone of the book was dark and gritty and the hot Australian Christmas season added to the atmosphere.The case is an interesting one. A childhood classmate of Gemma\u2019s, Rosalind Ryan, a local high school teacher, is found dead in the lake behind the school. Gemma and the beautiful, perfect Rosalind (Rose) have a complicated history dating back to their high school years. The details of that history and why Gemma keeps it a secret are slowly revealed throughout the novel. It seems just about everyone has secrets in this small town and there are surprises and twists along the way that kept me flipping the pages.Gemma\u2019s home life is a bit of a mess, creating a very flawed, damaged character. Maybe a little too damaged. I admit I grew weary of all her angst and drama, along with some of her actions. Readers who prefer likable characters (I\u2019m not one of those), will be disappointed. When the long held secret is finally revealed Gemma\u2019s emotional state suddenly all made perfect sense, although some of her actions still made me want to shake some sense into her. Thankfully, the ending gives the reader a little hope that things will turn around for Gemma in the next book. The mystery of who killed Rose is multi-layered and laid out perfectly for the reader. I would have preferred the author cleared up some inconsistencies regarding the victim\u2019s character, but, overall, this is an excellent debut.

Part police procedural and part character study, the result is an absorbing exploration of the secrets hidden within the small New South Wales town of Smithson. Imbued with a sense of place that takes its readers to the heart of a rural community sweltering in the build up to Christmas that is forced to turn the spotlight on itself in a search for answers. Alongside some superlative storytelling this absorbing debut is a painstakingly slow battle for lead homicide investigator, DS Gemma Woodstock, to expose the truth behind the murder of a former classmate that comes dangerously to threatening to reawaken the ghosts of her own messy past. When the body of beguiling Rosalind Ryan, the twenty-eight-year-old English teacher at Smithson High School is discovered face down at the edges of Sonny Lake surrounded by red roses the small town is united in shock. For lead detective, DS Gemma Woodstock, who alongside her police partner, DS Felix McKinnon is assigned to the case, her own personal memories of the enigmatic and inscrutably beautiful Rosalind, who was a former classmate, threaten to cloud her judgement as she investigates. As teenage contemporaries, Gemma was fascinated by the mysterious and aloof Rosalind, who seemed to hold a magnetic pull over all her peers. Having returned from Sydney to teach at her former high school four years previously it seems that very little has changed with her students and fellow teachers professing admiration and affection for her but with very few people having ever got any closer than arm\u2019s length with little evidence of intimacy in her life. But just what has brought Rosalind back to her rural hometown, especially given her tepid relationship which her stiff father and three awkward older brothers? And why, given his father\u2019s status as a millionaire local businessman, is Rosalind living so frugally in a barely furnished cottage with her only expenses seemingly devoted to fine wine with a stockpile of prescription medications for depression and anxiety? Against the backdrop of a triumphant modern reimagining of Romeo and Juliet scripted and produced by Rosalind and enacted by year twelve students the character of Romeo is played by the younger brother of Gemma\u2019s own first love in high school, Jacob, whose suicide still looms large in her own torrid past. Unwilling to be overtly forthright to her fellow detectives about the specifics of her shared history with Rosalind for fear of being taken off the investigation and colouring their own opinions of her, Gemma is forced to play her cards close to her chest. Already struggling to keep a lid on an intense romantic attachment to police partner, DS Felix McKinnon which threatens to devastate both of their stable families and increasingly unable to connect with live in partner and father to her young son, Gemma is driven to the point of exhaustion. As a fractious community and quick to criticise media presence exerts pressure on Gemma\u2019s boss, the supportive and plain-spoken Chief Superintendent Ken (\u201cJonesy\u201d) Jones, the desire for a resolution to the case ahead of Christmas mounts. As the detective partnership of Gemma and Felix slowly piece together Rosalind\u2019s history and more recent past, the secrets begin to come to light and in turn threaten Gemma\u2019s own personal skeletons... DS Gemma Woodstock is a flawed and very relatable character caught in an unenviable predicament who I found easy to relate to and empathise with. She does not shirk from facing her own mistakes and accepting responsibility for her shoddy treatment of partner Scott, which is a by-product of her frustration at the dilemmas she is faced with. Narrated almost in entirety by Gemma with a timeline that offers tantalisingly occasional glimpses into her teenage years as it steadily progresses to revealing the truth, the pace is undeniably languid. Behind the tough facade, hearing Gemma\u2019s perspective reveals her hidden vulnerabilities and adds depth to her character. The Dark Lake is undoubtedly a character driven mystery which is as much concerned with Gemma\u2019s own history as the murder of Rosalind Ryan and this ensures the suspense is two-fold, driven firstly by the learning the exact nature of how Gemma and Rosalind\u2019s past is connected and secondly, the identity of Rosalind\u2019s murderer. As the flashback glimpses comes thick and fast and the investigation reaches a head, I identified the guilty party and their motivations well before the close, however it did little to detract from my enjoyment of an assured debut. Bailey evokes a sense of place of a town that has doubled in population size in just a decade and thereby changed the landscape and culture of the community. At just over four hundred pages I did feel that The Dark Lake could have been edited to come in at a more readable length and although I enjoyed learning about Gemma\u2019s breakthrough case it did little to further my understanding of a character whose tenacity and willingness to \u201cgo rogue\u201d is never in doubt.Utterly absorbing, the slow pace as the authorities break down the wall of silence and the frustrations of a police team gives The Dark Lake the authentic feel of a team taking stock and factoring in their discoveries in order to edge progressively closer to the truth. As a more accurate picture of a manipulative and selfish Rosalind comes to light with rumours of the student teacher boundary being crossed, the murkier the investigation gradually becomes. Atmospheric and tense, seeing how the unfolding case would impact on Gemma and how her past has shaped her personality is undoubtedly well examined. Forced to accept some share of the burden of responsibility, it remains to be seen whether Smithson has a future for Gemma and her family after a case which takes its toll and makes abundantly clear that perhaps she and Rosalind have more in common than Gemma might like to admit. Whether a future case without the personal connection and with a settled domestic life can offer such fodder from Bailey and DS Gemma Woodstock remains to be seen, however I look forward to following the journey.With thanks to Readers First who provided me with a free copy of this novel in exchange for my honest and unbiased opinion."}, {"userName": "Trish at Between My Lines", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15939692-trish-at-between-my-lines", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on Between My LinesHeads up to all fans of police procedural thrillers, Sarah Bailey is the new author in town, and she is one to watch! \u00a0I saw\u00a0The Dark Lake by Sarah Bailey by Instagram a few times, and it caught my eye with its intruguing tagline \"A town of secrets waiting to explode\". \u00a0So I snapped it up when I saw it in my library audiobook app.\nMy Thoughts on\u00a0The Dark Lake by Sarah Bailey\nYou never know what to expect when you dive into a d\u00e9but novel. \u00a0But if you love secrets, small town settings and lots of suspense, then I'd recommend you take a chance on this one.The Dark Lake had so much going for it:- murky pasts and tangled secrets- a complicated lead character- An Australian setting- fab writing (I can see comparisons to Tana French being made)- A damn good mystery to keep you guessingI listened to the audiobook and I loved that the narrator was Australian, as it really immersed me into the setting. \u00a0Kate Hosking was also great at various voices, and I made the listening experience really enjoyable.\nThe bottom line on The Dark Lake by Sarah Bailey:\nMore please Ms Bailey!\u00a0\u00a0\nWho should read\u00a0The Dark Lake by Sarah Bailey?\nI'd recommend this to you if you enjoy authors such as Tana French, Samantha Hayes or Lucy Dawson. \u00a0And also if you enjoy lots of suspense and untangling secrets from the past."}, {"userName": "Bill Kupersmith", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12460952-bill-kupersmith", "userReview": "Especially for English-speaking readers, we now have more national literatures than we have stories, so that with a few changes in local colour & weather, it doesn\u2019t matter very much whether we\u2019re reading Australian literature, Canadian literature, or (in translation) Scandinavian literature. Sarah Bailey\u2019s The Dark Lake is set in NSW @ Christmastime, but except for the characters sweltering in holiday party Santa costumes whilst threatened by bush fires, the story could have as easily taken place near Winnipeg with blizzards instead. It\u2019s set in a provincial town, apparently just far enough from Sydney to escape being a suburb. Rosalind Ryan, a popular high-school English & drama teacher has been drowned in a nearby lake, just as her production of an adaptation of Romeo & Juliet was being performed @ the school, with the lead actor a prime suspect. What makes this story special is that the principal detective & narrator, Gemma Woodstock, was Rosalind\u2019s contemporary & rival when they were students @ the same school. Not very professional, but in a small town it\u2019s believable that an investigator would have been involved with the victim (cf. The Dry.) But Gemma\u2019s personal life is out of control. She is still attached to the memory of her high-school heartthrob Jacob, who committed suicide. She is living with the father of her son Ben - a pre-schooler - who is named Scott, whom she has not married. But Gemma is currently involved in a secret passionate affair with an Englishman named Felix, a married man with teenagers who is also her detective partner. (Even less professional, granted.) Tho\u2019 I thoroughly disliked Gemma (& if the series continues I\u2019ll not be around for her reappearances), I found Rosalind a fascinating and attractive character and was caught up in the quest for her killer. Gemma\u2019s own life is, frankly, a mess, & she constantly overacts the role of star in her own domestic drama. This book is also too long. An excessive number of minor characters introduce themselves for no other reason than to be red herrings. With better editing @ about 3/4 the present length, The Dark Lake would be a enjoyable read-once-and-forget, tho\u2019 strangely I found Rose haunting: I could imagine a school story like Mindy Mijia\u2019s Everything You Want Me to Be with her as a main character. As I\u2019ve just finished composing a novel featuring a school production of Shakespeare, it was quite fun to compare notes. But as a detective story, The Dark Lake is readable but Gemma is too high-maintenance to be worth the effort to keep as a friend.

A beautiful, young teacher is found dead close to the local highschool. The main police investigator is a former school mate of hers - Gemma Woods - who's a detective at only twenty- eight years old. I liked that the main character was an imperfect police woman, with some dirty laundry in the closet. Unfortunately, despite her being the narrator, I never really warmed up to her. There was something off about the voice. Around the 26% mark, I had an inkling on who the killer was. I'm annoyed that I was right, although I didn't try to figure it out.

She's been murdered, her body left floating with red roses surrounding her. Detective Sergeant Gemma Woodstock and her partner, Felix, are called in to investigate Rosalind's case. Nothing about Rosalind adds up--everyone seemed to like her, but no one really knew her. She lived in a cheap apartment, but clearly had expensive taste in wine and makeup. She was the youngest of four, with three brothers, one of with whom she'd quarreled recently. Her father, George, is ill and runs a large business conglomerate in Australia, yet seemed to adore his inscrutable daughter. As for Gemma, she has memories of Rosalind from their time together in high school, when the beautiful Rose seemed enigmatic even then. Gemma and Felix have their hands full, focusing on Rosalind's co-workers, students, family, and more. Who is responsible for the death of this lovely teacher? This is an intriguing and compelling two part mystery, with the present-day case focusing on Rosalind, combined with flashes to Gemma's past, focusing on her history with her former boyfriend Jacob, who died as a teen. The majority of our story is told from Gemma's present-day point of view, but we get a few key snippets from the townspeople and occasionally Gemma's point of view flashes to the past. I really liked Gemma as a narrator. The intersection of the case with her past was extremely well-done. I read some reviews where the readers didn't care for Gemma, but that wasn't the case for me, though I could understand, as the story wore on, how they came to that point of view. She doesn't always make the right decisions, and I'm intrigued to see what she'll be like in the next novel (Goodreads tell me this is the first book in the series). But for me, I identified with her in many ways and, because she was so well-written, really enjoyed the story from her point of view, even if I didn't always agree with her actions. It was also great to get to see a character dealing with the challenges of being female and a mother in a small police force--in a small town no less--in what seemed to be, overall, a fairly realistic fashion. The story itself is great. There are several twists that really got me, so major kudos to Bailey. I read a lot of thrillers, and it's not always easy to surprise me! For a huge portion of this book, I had *no idea* where this was going to go, or who killed Rosalind. Several times I found myself genuinely shocked by the happenings and was completely enthralled by the story and Bailey's characters. (I also can't believe this is a debut novel - wow.) She does an excellent job at creating tension in the story and the characters, slowing unfurling plot points and details as we go along. This novel is truly a puzzle, the pieces fitting into place as we go along, and putting them together is a joy. It is so well-done and Bailey's weaving together the past and the present is excellent. I wound up really liking Gemma, and her boss Jonesy, and I'm quite excited this is a series. I can't wait to see where Bailey takes us (and Gemma) next. 4.5 stars.

I think what I enjoyed most about it is that while the premise of the book is centered around solving a murder, Bailey doesn\u2019t dive too deep into the police procedurals that tend to bore me. Additionally, kudos to Bailey to staying away from the clich\u00e9 cop who is drinking themselves into a stupor and jeopardizing their job.With that being said, well Gemma, see Gemma\u2019s got issues. Not just issues, the girl has some serious baggage. But Bailey tells the story in such a way that I didn\u2019t get annoyed with Gemma (although there were times when a slap across the face would have been appropriate). I usually find myself immersed in serious eye rolls when I have to read about the alcoholic cop who continually makes stupid mistakes. I really enjoyed the character development as well as how the past and present weaved together to solve the murder of Rose. Not to mention that I was pleasantly surprised that the author was able to keep me guessing and I was not able to guess who killed Rose. This is always a nice treat because I read so many books in this genre that I can usually figure it out. Although this is the first book in a series, I will probably not continue to read about Gemma as I am not the biggest fan of police driven books, especially those in a series.

When Rosalind Ryan\u2019s body is found in the lake by Smithson Secondary College, Detective Sergeant Gemma Woodstock wants to be on the case, even though it might dredge up some bitter memories for her. Gemma assures her boss that their connection was casual, and she\u2019s fine to handle whatever comes up, but she doesn\u2019t share certain facts that may affect her performance. Rose taught at Smithson Secondary, and was loved by both students and fellow staff; she was a talented drama teacher and her murder occurred after a first-night performance of her modern adaptation of Romeo and Juliet. The list of those needing to be questioned is extensive: students, family, colleagues and nearby residents. Despite some excellent detective work, progress is slow and helpful evidence appears only sporadically.Gemma may be a good cop, but she\u2019s no angel: despite living with the devoted father of her young son, she has a sexual relationship with her work partner, DS Felix McKinnon, and that\u2019s just one of the secrets she\u2019s keeping. It soon becomes apparent that the townspeople of Smithson are harbouring quite a few secrets, some as hot as the summer they\u2019re sweltering through.Bailey crafts her tale with skill: she gives the reader a plot filled with jealousy, infatuation, passion, grief, lust, love and guilt. Clues are drip-fed to reveal twists, tricks and red herrings that keep the reader guessing right through to the explosive climax. With some gorgeous prose, she captures the small country town, the era, the attitudes of the residents with consummate ease. Her characters are multifaceted and easily believable, and their dialogue is what is heard in any small-town school, caf\u00e9, shop or pub.

As with any small town, everyone knows everyone, though there are plenty of secrets. The murder of a local girl forces everyone's business under the microscope, and this novel is as much about those secrets as it is about solving the mystery of who killed Rosalind Ryan.I have to be completely honest, I disliked the protagonist, Gemma, from the very start. The reality was addressed before her emotions were revealed and the cold facts of her situation had me instantly appalled. It was unclear what her relationship with the victim was, and this aspect created a darkness around the mystery that admittedly made it quite fascinating. However it also made it hard to get into the story, as I couldn't relate to Gemma in the slightest. I had no sympathy for her or her struggles so all that held my attention was the mystery itself.Rosalind (Rose) Ryan is an enigma, with many characters professing to have known her but only superficially. As a teacher at the local high school she was loved by many, but it becomes increasingly clear that no one had any clue who she really was. There are subtle references to the past she and Gemma shared, but never enough for us to really sink our teeth into. Beyond being beautiful, we never really get a clear picture of the victim, which again creates a sense of detachment that makes the mystery a simple curiosity rather than something we can be invested in.It's obvious the crime has something to do with the past, but we're given very little information in that regard. There are never really any clues for us to play with, and the detective work feels messy and unsatisfying. We discover a lot of the town's secrets but none seem relevant to the mystery at hand. We meet a lot of characters but get to know very few of them. There's nothing to create attachment to any of the main players, really, which is a shame because with an invested element this could have been a ripper of a read. Instead the reader is left impartial, and there's little to propel the narrative. Even the mystery of the past seems patchy and the slowly revealed glimpses of it are unsatisfying and anti-climatic. The relationship between Gemma and Felix seems more of a focus than the mystery which was a little disappointing to me, particularly as I didn't approve of it. It made the story drag and detracted from the suspense. It made a rather long, tedious novel of what could have been an intriguing, fast read. This novel is all about Gemma and her tumultuous life, but there's little for the reader to relate to on an emotional level, making it a redundant angle. Even with her as a mother, we're given little to work with. Her relationships are ill-defined and we're given very little reasoning for the way she thinks and acts.I was quite interested in the crime and its relation to the past, with lots of loose strings revealed throughout the novel. Unfortunately, when the conclusion came, I felt that a lot of things were left unanswered or nonsensical in their inclusion. I just couldn't understand a lot of what happened and the resolution left me feeling impartial and unaffected.This is a rather ambitious story with beautiful prose in parts, but it's tied messily together and seems like it could have used a lot of tough love from an editor. It has a lot of potential and is still an entertaining read, but I feel like it missed the mark a little. Hopefully further work from the author will iron out the kinks in her storytelling.***I received an uncorrected proof copy and noticed a few errors that will hopefully be picked up before the novel is printed for wider publication:-Page 154, the character Kai is referred to by a different surname- Page 221 contains an unnecessary comma before 'Ms Ryan'-Page 249 'she's walks' instead of 'she walks'-Page 276 refers to ground being particularly dry, despite the fact it rained the previous day.-Page 339 contains a misplaced \\I'm not one to point out these errors in an uncorrected copy of a novel however as a proofreader I feel it's good practice for me to bring attention to these things.

She is living with Scott, who loves her, (not sure why he does) and they have a young son Ben. Yet much of her time is spent getting together or fantasizing about her married policeman partner Felix. I became thoroughly sick of her going on and on about sex with Felix.
