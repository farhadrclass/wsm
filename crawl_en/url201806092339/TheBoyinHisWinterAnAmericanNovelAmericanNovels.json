Somehow they became time travelers until Hurricane Katrina shipwrecked Huck back into passing time.Along the way, they saw America caught in wars, the marvel of electric lighting, and how racism kept its grip on society. Jim got off the raft in 1960, finding a lynch mob waiting for him. In 2005 Huck meets James, who tries to keep him from harm. As an adult, Huck falls in love with Jameson, who becomes his wife. She writes a novel, The Boy In His Winter. Like Jim, James and Jameson are African American.What Huck realizes from his vantage point of 85 years is how badly he treated Jim, how he accepted his society's values unthinking, diminishing Jim as a person and as a friend.\"I was bothered that I had come to hate him, bothered even more that I had loved him. I'm not sure that I regarded him then as a man. Not entirely. That broad view of humanity was alien to a mind that had been formed haphazardly, like a shack put together out of old lumber, warped and ill-used.(...)We'd wasted much time when we might have understood what was happening on the raft while we were close in on the river's end, which as not to be the journey's end, as I learned later.\" Huck Finn, A Boy in His WinterAt the end of his life, Huck returns to his hometown to play act Mark Twain, telling his own life stories. Huck calls his story a comedy, having seen enough for 'three or four lifetimes.\"\"Haven't you learned by now how fantastic a business it is to be alive?\"-Huck Finn, A Boy in His WinterThe novel is episodic, meandering as the Mississippi River, but I was charmed by Huck's narrative, although there is nothing of innocence to be found. Huck is deformed by societal values, pursuing wealth and conspicuous consumption as an adult as thoughtlessly as he accepted slavery in his youth. With a broad overview of American history distilled into one lifetime, and grappling with memory and how the past is altered with our storytelling of it, Huck's tale shows the darkness behind what we remember as Twain's story of boyish freedom.I received a book from the publisher as part of a LibraryThing giveaway."}, {"userName": "Nathan Schmidt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25066475-nathan-schmidt", "userReview": "I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads, and am grateful for the opportunity. To write a sequel to a classic novel is a daunting task on its own, and to give the original tale, rooted in reality, otherworldly elements only increases the danger. Yet Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn built their legends off taking risks.As one who has read much of Twain's writings, including both Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn, I found some of the changes from Twain's canon to be somewhat unsettling. The changing of the entire river trip from its very origin back in Hannibal throws everything out of the water, and as a result I found later references to adventures such as with the supposed Duke to be puzzling. The plot seemed to have less consistency compared with the original work. There was the fateful trip down the river, then the events once the time travel stopped, and finally the third section. I found the last part to be the most jarring, since it just didn't seem right to me to leap forward all those years and conclude on that note. The third part seemed unnecessary in my opinion, and could be blended in with part two.I liked how the story brought more character to Jim. On the other hand, I think he might have lost some parts of his character that stood out in the original classic.The lack of the vivid, diverse vernacular languages I have grown accustomed to in Twain's works was jarring, and I just felt the language in the book was a little disappointing.Most of all, Huck's divergence from his original character in the book left me uneasy. He had a very interesting personality in the original, and his outright rejection of Twain's portrayal hurt in a way.On the other hand, Huck did retain many qualities that let me see him as Huckleberry Finn. I can kind of understand and forgive his hatred for Twain, as he is trying to break free of the limits imposed on fiction and prove himself as a living being. Much of the adventure still had the sort of feel I get from reading Twain. Although this book may not be the best tribute to Mark Twain's original piece, it is still a good extension of the original story, one that continues to explore fundamental parts of humanity. I enjoyed the long journey down the river, and feel that I learned something from the adventure, just as I did from Twain's original story.As for grammatical issues, I found nothing seriously wrong. This is very well-written for an advance copy, and I believe that the final version will be even better."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "Intriguing premise: a time-traveling Huck Finn sequel, spanning more than two centuries!

Thick brown ropes of water knotted all around the raft, but we went on, untouched by the upheaval. Around us, the weather was faultess. We lay on the rough deck, sunning ourselves. We might have fished up great whales from the bottom, so magical the day seemed, though the sky above the shore to either side of us was dark and solemn, as if that afternoon were the first Good Friday, and we, two careless centurions throwing dice. We could not have known we were in the eye of a storm, surrounded everywhere by rising water, if not for trees, stumps, the walls and roofs of houses, and the bloated cows sweeeping past us. That was 1851, the year of the Great Flood.

G. Wells. How very like Tom Sawyer to own such a tale of outlandish adventure! I realized when I was back on the raft that he had borrowed it from the Baton Rouge Public Library. I\u2019m ashamed to say, it is long overdue. I\u2019ve read the story many times since then and never fail to picture the Time Traveler as Tom himself, how he looked on the skiff, coming toward me from the General Sumter. Yes, I\u2019d been taught to read haltingly, in Hannibal by Miss Waston and Widow Douglas as part of their campaign to civilize me. I thought the book was a sign---not a bad omen, but a harbinger of good fortune; that it was a guarantee of safe conduct through the streets of Baton Rouge, which Tom had consecrated by having lived ther and having also died there ( which the more powerful juju, I could not know). My ideas were hazy and unformed about the meaning of Jim\u2019s and my journey downriver, but I guessed it had something to do with time travel.

This synopsis (who knows where or how I absorbed it) isn\u2019t really accurate. Yes, Huck and Jim are on a raft. Yes, the raft passes through the edge of Katrina. But The Boy in His Winter is much more complex in its aspirations.Rather than offering a quick one-line summary that includes only a small part of the book\u2019s overall narrative, it might be more useful to look at the publisher releasing the book. In this case, the publisher is Bellevue Literary Press (BLP), which bills itself as \u201cthe first and only nonprofit press dedicated to literary fiction and nonfiction at the intersection of the arts and sciences.\u201d BLP hopes to \u201cpromote science literacy in unaccustomed ways and offer new tools for thinking about our world.\u201d This isn\u2019t a Huck-meets-Katrina book; it\u2019s a much more metaphysical work that questions the nature of time while traversing key moments in American history.I enjoyed this book at the beginning. Huck, now very old and near dying, is recounting his story to an anonymous amanuensis. He wanders a bit, he cogitates, he questions as much as tells: \u201cOf course, I reckon time differently now than we did then, sweeping down the Mississippi toward Mexico as though in a dream. Those days did seem like a dream, though not mine, or Jim\u2019s, either, but one belonging to somebody whose hand I almost felt, prodding me onward in spite of my reluctance.\u201d That\u2019s rich language, the kind one wants to read aloud for the pleasure of feeling it roll about in one\u2019s mouth.As the book progressed and the metaphysical pondering continued, I grew less charmed. The prose was still lovely, but as I read I felt as though I was waiting for someone or something to appear that, Godot-like, never showed its face. What I was longing for, I think, was the physical Huck, the boy of flesh and blood. Yes, Huck was a thinker, but he was also young, vital, alive, and to have this aspect of him jettisoned from the beginning left me frustrated.Many of Huck\u2019s thoughts\u2014on slavery and race, on friendship and its limits, on the human condition\u2014are interesting. And the book offers some small moments of action: a Civil War battle, the brief glimpse of Katrina, the birth of jazz from southern blues music. Jim, who dies before Huck, reappears in different guises and the reader enjoys seeing him change as his spirit is transported to new eras. But too many of Huck\u2019s thoughts are repetitious, and the blurred depiction of the external world leaves readers anchorless on this float down time and river.The Boy in His Winter does \u201cpromote science literacy in unaccustomed ways,\u201d but the \u201ctools for thinking about our world\u201d are limited: Time is fluid; People do and don\u2019t change. This isn\u2019t so much science literacy as scientific generalization written over and over again."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109487-jessica", "userReview": "Consider this literate, thoughtful, and riveting novel as an alternative history, and in a way, alternative American literature.Huck and Jim doze off on their raft, and drift through time, bumping up against the Civil War (where Tom Sawyer appears, and later, his surprises are revealed), the Jazz Age, and onto into this century and nearly the next.

The prose in The Boy in His Winter is fluid, moving the reader organically through the story told by a reimagined Huckleberry Finn. I truly enjoyed the experience of reading Lock's words. However, the story left much to be desired. Lock's premise is an intriguing one -- what if Huck and Jim had been caught in some sort of magical time bubble on their raft ride and floated down the Mississippi for hundreds of years, through events such as the Civil War and Hurricane Katrina? The execution of this tale is what's lacking. Huck (or Albert Barthelemy, as Huck renames himself after he enters back into the normal space-time continuum) is our narrator and doesn't seem confident about the story he's telling the reader. There are too many interruptions from Huck throughout the narrative and his constant interruptions are comparable to a mosquito buzzing near the ear. Huck is constantly interjecting into and justifying his tale: \"It's my book\"; \"You're about to object\"; and \"You're claiming I preach too much\" are just a few of the many examples of this. A more delft editor should have removed these asides, as they distract the reader from what could have been a very solid story. Another problem I encountered with the narrator was his language. While Twain's original tellings are mired in controversy because of his use of the vernacular at the time, all of that is tossed aside for a tale with nothing but proper English. While this is easier to read, it rang false. This is not to say that I wasn't entertained. Huck has much on which to reflect in his tale, such as Jim's demise; Tom Sawyer's death; and his adventures as an inadvertent marijuana smuggler with the Connery brothers, Edgar and Edmund, along with James Toussaint. After Jim's death, Huck encounters two \"forms\" of Jim in James Toussaint and later Jameson, the presumed love of his life (although that portion of the novel feels very rushed). But at the end of the book, I was left disappointed in the execution."}, {"userName": "Preston Postle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4244903-preston-postle", "userReview": "Huck Finn and time travel? How could this NOT be good?!You'd be surprised at how many ways it could be not good, actually. In this disastrous retelling of \"Huckleberry Finn,\" Huck and Jim travel down the Mississippi and inexplicably leap ahead through time into the 21st century. Although Mr. Lock's poetic prose elevates \"Boy\" above the mundane, it never seems to SAY anything. How many times can narrator Huck, now an old, mysteriously eloquent man, wonder about the weirdness of time-traveling on a raft? The absurdly short tableaux that the travelers witness when they pause in their journey never tell a story or reveal much. Did Mark Twain, as Huck declares, really make up the events that he told in his version? Why, then, do they seem to be memories for Huck-as-an-old-man? In the grand finale, we get to see Huck as a sidekick in a modern drug deal that goes wrong.

Huck is telling his story as an old man in the year 2077. Huck often complains about the way Twain told his story, and insists that he wants to tell it his own way, but admits that his telling of the story isn't the whole truth either, due to the unreliability of words and memory. I'm not generally a big fan of magical realism, but I really liked it in this book. Yet, overall, the book disappointed me. I felt that more could have been done with Huck as a character, and I wish more had been made of the changes Huck sees in American between 1835 and 2077, and how he adapts to them.

I finished this absolutely elegant narrative feeling that Huck Finn has never been more alive.\u201d \u2014DAVID OSHINSKY, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of Polio: An American Story and Worse Than Slavery: Parchman Farm and the Ordeal of Jim Crow JusticeLaunched into existence by Mark Twain in 1835, Huck Finn and Jim have now been transported by Norman Lock through three vital, violent, and transformative centuries of American history. As time unfurls on the river\u2019s banks, they witness decisive battles of the Civil War, the betrayal of Reconstruction\u2019s promises to the freed slaves, the crushing of the Native American nations, and the electrification of a continent. Huck, who finally comes of age when he\u2019s washed up on shore during Hurricane Katrina, narrates the story as an older and wiser man in 2077, revealing our nation\u2019s past, present, and future as Mark Twain could never have dreamed it.The Boy in His Winter is a tour-de-force work of imagination, beauty, and courage that re-envisions a great American literary classic for our time.Norman Lock, a recipient of the Aga Kahn Prize from The Paris Review and a writing fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts, is the author of many works of fiction, including Love Among the Particles.
