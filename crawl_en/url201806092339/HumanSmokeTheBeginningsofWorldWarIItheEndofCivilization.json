It's an attempt at objectivity, to be sure, but Baker isn't really interested in being \"objective\" because no one ever can be. Instead he's a pacifist who's interested in showing how nearly every leader involved was itching for war--more war and wider war and just more killing on a scale unknown beforehand. It's a compelling way to write an anti-war history, and an eye-opening one, where Churchill is more a bumbling drunken psychopath than a hero and all leaders are united in their antipathy to the anti-war movement. Written in short passages largely devoid of commentary, it's quite provocative, occasionally infuriating (fury at those involved in the war, not Baker), and at times virtually unput-downable."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "Human Smoke is many things, I think.Nicholson Baker himself intended it as a memorial to \u201cCharles Pickett and other American and British pacifists. They\u2019ve never really gotten their due. They tried to save Jewish refugees, feed Europe, reconcile the United States and Japan, and stop the war from happening. They failed, but they were right,\u201d and to some extent he intended it as an argument for peace \u2013- more likely peace as pacifism. It is a chronicle of the worst war criminals that we\u2019ve ever seen, specifically Hitler, Churchill and Roosevelt (and their lackeys), with cameo appearances by some other nasty criminals like Stalin, Chiang Kai-shek, and Tojo. It shows how their actions and decisions continue to reverberate into today, and how the positive or negative mythologies that have sprung up around them don\u2019t even begin to tell the truth. Moreover, we\u2019re still fighting the fights they started, and seem doomed to keep fighting them.As I write this the \u201cBlue Angels\u201d and \u201cSnowbirds,\u201d those dazzling, acrobatic show offs of American and Canadian aviation military might are streaking over my home to the delight of my militarized neighbours. Their delight and my disgust. Their delight and my shame.But back to Human Smoke. It is an anecdotal history that uncovers the ugliness of us all. There are contextual gaps, there are omissions, there is spin, but it is a powerful book and an important one. I, in my dilettante historianism, knew most of what Baker was offering already, but he surprised even me at times, and I\u2019ve never seen the dirtiness of WWII presented in quite so powerful a way.As I closed the cover, though, I didn\u2019t end with a new dedication to pacifism as so many have before me. If anything, Baker\u2019s moments spent with Gandhi merely underlined the failings of pacifism. Gandhi\u2019s non-violence would have been for nought if England wasn\u2019t busy bombing and being bombed by Germany. England would have rolled over Gandhi and Nehrou and we'd have forgotten all about them and their desire for independence. I didn't heed the call to pacifism, nor was I filled with a new dedication to war as an answer either. What it did leave me with was a desire to dedicate myself to imagining a new way. Militarism doesn\u2019t work. We know that. Pacfism doesn\u2019t work, even though it makes those engaged in it feel better about themselves (and superior to others). But we seem incapable of finding another way. What good are our minds if we can\u2019t imagine another way? I am positive there must be another way. I want to find it. My gut tells me it has something to do with forgiveness. For now I will go with my gut and see where it takes me. Thanks for the kick in the ass, Nicholson Baker. I hope you do the same for many, many others."}, {"userName": "David Gross", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123081-david-gross", "userReview": "A collection of vignettes \u2014 some only a paragraph long, few longer than a page \u2014 of episodes from the years leading up to the second World War, and then from the years of the war itself up through 1941. Baker mostly leaves his own voice out of it, except for a few paragraphs of \u201cafterword\u201d at the end.The book generated a lot of heat when it was released a few months ago because it challenges the idea that World War II was a \u201cgood\u201d war, something that is today an article of faith for all decent civilized people.World War II is so revered these days, with all of the \u201cgreatest generation\u201d fooferaw, politicians trying to get themselves compared to Churchill, and the like, that people have come to have a weird nostalgia for the period as if it were the high point of civilization, when in fact it was very much the opposite.The greatest generation gave us the greatest failure of civilization the world has ever seen, resulting in the deaths of millions, the development of the technology of genocide, the normalization of a military policy of barbarity towards civilians, and ending with a gargantuan communist terror-state crushing much of Europe and Asia and, along with the United States, threatening the world with nuclear annihilation.The only thing that might have been worse would have been if the Axis powers had won. Ay, there\u2019s the rub. And that sentiment has been the quick and potent retort to anyone who questions the article of faith.Baker isn\u2019t satisfied with this: \u201cMy feelings about the war change every day. But I also feel that there is a way of looking at the war and the Holocaust that is truer and sadder and stranger than the received version.\u201dThe defenders of the received version were quick to respond. In the New York Times, a reviewer said:Did the war \u201chelp anyone who needed help?\u201d Mr. Baker asks in a plaintive afterword. The prisoners of Belsen, Dachau and Buchenwald come to mind, as well as untold millions of Russians, Danes, Belgians, Czechs and Poles. Nowhere and at no point does Mr. Baker ever suggest, in any serious way, how their liberation might have been effected other than by force of arms.But in fact, with few exceptions, the prisoners of Belsen, Dachau, and Buchenwald were not liberated by the war \u2014 they were murdered during the course of it. And Baker does suggest, in many places in the book, how many opportunites to aid and rescue Jewish refugees and \u201cuntold millions\u201d of suffering Europeans, were squandered \u2014 indeed, actively discouraged or forbidden \u2014 by the Allies in pursuit of their war aims or other policies.Much of the criticism of Baker\u2019s book is similarly knee-jerk. Some borders on paranoid \u2014 ascribing to Baker opinions and assertions that he never explicitly makes, but finding them implicit in his constellation of vignettes. Baker invites this sort of thing by muting his own voice and leaving the interpretation of his examples (and his choices of what examples to include) to the reader. I think Baker probably deliberately chose to suggest controversial things in this way that he felt afraid to or unable to defend explicitly, which is too bad, but his critics see this as a license to invent straw man arguments to attack, which is also too bad. Someone called the book \u201ca 500-page Rorschach Test,\u201d which hits the nail on the head.The callousness to the plight of Jewish refugees is one of the themes of the selections Baker chose. Other themes that receive prominent play include:* the evolution of the policy of attacks on the civilian population, particularly by the Allies \u2014 largely aerial bombardments, but also chemical & biological warfare and starvation blockades* that these attacks on the civilian population, sold as a method for demoralizing and weakening the enemy, most frequently did just the opposite, and served mainly to slake a thirst for bloody revenge on the part of the attackers* the efforts of various pacifist groups to encourage negotiation, inoculate against war fever, and assist refugees and other war victims* the evolution of the \u201cfinal solution\u201d as the war escalated, with the implication (I think) that the Nazis became more savage toward their victims the more they themselves felt the savagery of the war* the surprising (to me) extent to which the United States was engaging in war against the Axis powers prior to the Pearl Harbor attack and the formal declaration of warThe book is a powerful, captivating, relentless read. It has flaws \u2014 Baker\u2019s aforementioned editorial stand-offishness; an unseemly amount of na\u00efvet\u00e9, particularly when it comes to being shocked and surprised (or worse, credulous) at politicians\u2019 hypocritical platitudes or at the commonplace racism of the period; and a largely United States-centric view of the war. Still, it\u2019s an eye-opener, and a good remedy for anyone who\u2019s had a poisonous dose of History Channel."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/389214-chris", "userReview": "In a 1942 essay called \"Pacifism and the War,\" Orwell wrote a review of this new book:\"1. The Fascizing processes occurring in Britain as a result of war are systematically exaggerated. 2. The actual record of Fascism, especially its pre-war history, is ignored or pooh-poohed as \u2018propaganda\u2019. Discussion of what the world would actually be like if the Axis dominated it is evaded. 3. Those who want to struggle against Fascism are accused of being wholehearted defenders of capitalist \u2018democracy\u2019. The fact that the rich everywhere tend to be pro-Fascist and the working class are nearly always anti-Fascist is hushed up. 4. It is tacitly pretended that the war is only between Britain and Germany. Mention of Russia and China, and their fate if Fascism is permitted to win, is avoided. (You won\u2019t find one word about Russia or China in the three letters you sent to me.)\" Not all of these criticisms of wartime pacifists can be applied directly to Baker's book, but there is some pretty significant overlap. This book is a captivating read, but it should not be treated as a serious work of history at all. It's useful in reminding us that all parties in war, even the \"good guys,\" committ massive atrocities and in recovering the memories of some truly decent and admirable Quaker peace activists, but it belongs in the fiction section of your local library."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/371422-ed", "userReview": "An earth shattering book.

Everything I know is wrong.Roosevelt knew about the Japanese navy moving toward Pearl Harbor.Winston Churchill did all he could to antagonize Germany into a war of attrition through the air.Britain bombed German cities before the London Blitz started.Jews suffered more due to the English blockade of Germany than anyone else.Roosevelt purposefully antagonized the Japanese, hoping for a blow so the U.S. would willingly go to war.In 1940 and 1941 peace was possible and tens of millions of Europeans, Jews and gentiles alike, could have been saved.An unwillingness to kill does not constitute your support for your nation's chosen enemies.Britain put Germans, mostly Jewish refugees, into internment camps. Hitler was a monster but Roosevelt and Churchill chose war over diplomacy and Churchill was having a grand ole time playing at war.

The stories appear in the book in strict chronological order. The author provides no discussion of context or connecting commentary. The stories speak for themselves. The book starts with August 1892, jumps to 1914, and then proceeds more slowly through the 1920s and 1930s. The book ends on December 31, 1941.A reader needs to have enough knowledge of history to provide their own context to understand how the stories in this book are related. Consequently, I can see how it might be possible for readers influenced by various world views could arrive at differing conclusions. The only overt commentary from the author regarding the meaning of the whole is in the title, the subtitle and the Afterword of the book. In the Afterword the author praises the efforts of the pacifists who \"failed but they were right.\"The stories are interesting. However, getting through a long book filled with them can be a bit of a drag. I have selected a variety of stories from the book below to provide an idea of what the book is like. The comments prior to each quotation are my own. Here's something that Churchill in later years probably wished he hadn't said:\"Winston Churchill visited Rome. \"I could not help being charmed by Signor Mussolini's gentle and simple bearing, and by his calm, detached poise in spite of so many burdens and danger,\" Churchill said in a press statement. Italian fascism, he said, had demonstrated that there was a way to combat subversive forces; it had provided the \"necessary antidote to the russian virus.\"\"If I had been an Italian I am sure I should have been entirely with you from the beginning to the end of your victorious struggle against the bestial appetites and passions of Leninism,\" Churchill told the Romans. It was January 20, 1927. \"The following is an example of some (grim) humor:Milton Mayer, a writer who worked for the president of the University of Chicago, heard a story.\" A Jew is riding a streetcar, reading the Volkischer Beobachter the main Nazi paper. A non-Jew sits down next to him and says, \"Why are you reading the Beobachter ?\" The Jew says: \"Look, I work in a factory all day, my wife nags me, my kids are sick, and there's no money for food. what should I do on my way home, read the Jewish newspaper? 'Pogrom in Romania.' 'Jews Murdered in Poland.' 'New Laws against Jews.' No, sir, a half hour a day, on the streetcar, I read the Beobachter. 'Jews the World Capitalists.' 'Jews Control Russia.' 'Jews Rule in England.' That's me they're talking about. A half hour a day I'm somebody.\" \" (approx. January 1938)Here's a report with a name to remember:\"Lord Cherwell's personal secretary looked at 650 reconnaissance photographs of places the Royal Air Force had bombed earlier that summer. The secretary's conclusions were that, on average, one in five airplanes that took off from England to bomb Germany or the coast of France successfully placed its bombs somewhere within seventy-five square miles of its assigned target. when there was no moon or heavy flack, the miss rate was even higher.The secretary's name was David Benusson-Butt, and this report, dated August 18, 1941, achieved fame as the Butt Report.\"Here's an example of how justice and due process are the first victims in war:\"Muriel Lester, author of \"Speed the Food Ships,\" became on of England's political detenus. It was August 19, 1941.Lester was on a boat in Trinidad, on her way to the Far East, where she planned to visit Gandhi. A British official said to her, \"I am afraid I shall have to ask you to come ashore.\"\"Are you arresting me?\" said Lester.\"Oh,no!\" said the official.\"Then, supposing I say I won't come,\" said Lester. \"What happens?\"I'm afraid--er--we would have to find means to induce you to do so.\"Lester's passport was revoked, and she was held in a barbedwire prison camp for a month and a half, without charges. Later, she was transferred to Holloway jail in London and then, after friends made calls to the Home Office, freed. \"I found this quote of interest since it seemed to indicate that some gentile Germans had humane feelings toward the Jews:\"The Stuttgart Courier published an article attacking cases of unsuitable compassion for Jews. These cases were not unusual, the newspaper said. For instance, women from the Jewish old people's home wearing the star would get on a tram car and passengers would stand to give them their seats. Once, according to the newspaper, a German said to a Jew, \"It really requires more courage to wear the star than to go to war.\" It was October 4, 1941.Jeanette Ranken's vote against entering WWII after Pearl Harbor (December 8, 1941):\"When she heard here name in the roll call she stood. 'As a woman I can't go to war,' she said, 'And I refuse to send anyone else.' Hers was the only no vote, and it was hissed and booed. In the cloak room some Army officers shouted abuse at her. \"You've been drinking,\" Ranken said, and she took refuge in a phone booth. Later she told a colleague that the representatives had pressured her to make the vote unanimous. And yet it was that insistence on uniformity, that intolerance of descent, that was just what was wrong with the other side in the war. No, Ranken thought, I'm going to vote one vote for democracy. \" I have not included the description referred to in the following story, but trust me, it's absurd:Life Magazine published an article on how to tell a Japanese person from a Chinese person.

This is how I learned about the book.:THE GOOD WAR?Nicholson Baker has a point to make, but Human Smoke is not a straightforward polemic that argues his case. Rather it is a book of vignettes that show the state of the world leading up to World War II. The raw material comes from newspapers, radio programs, speeches, diaries, and similar cultural flotsam. They are all very artfully put together and presented to us, so that by the end we see the entire tragic picture of a world gone wrong and Mr. Baker\u2019s argument is driven unfailingly home.HUMAN SMOKE: THE BEGINNINGS OF WORLD WAR II, THE END OF CIVILIZATION, by Nicholson Baker (Simon & Schuster, 2008)"}, {"userName": "Greg Brozeit", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26552534-greg-brozeit", "userReview": "One of my favorite German words is mitdenken. It\u2019s one of those beguilingly simple words that\u2019s so hard to translate into English (can\u2019t speak for other languages). It literally means \u201cto think with (or along),\u201d which implies that one has to know something about what is being talked about\u2014a joke, history, culture\u2014in order to really understand the meaning behind what is said or written. You have to fill in the blanks of what is implied in order to get it. I wrote about this before as it applied to humor. In the case of Human Smoke, you need to know something about pre-World War II history or, at a minimum, something about the war itself.The book is unlike anything else I\u2019ve read. It\u2019s a chronological collection of snippets from periodicals, memoirs and diaries, and other contemporaneous sources from 1914 through December 31, 1941. Nicholson Baker adds very little analysis, polemicizing, or commentary other than sentences to round out the source materials and serve as a loose rhetorical glue to tie each passage together. Some are a sentence or two, few are longer than a page. He gives prominence to some obscure, mostly forgotten historical figures and events, especially related to pacifism. The result is a mesmerizing, compelling narrative; indeed, if you are drawn in, it is hard to put down. And since every reference comes from a concurrent source, it is implied (mitdenken!) that people of the time knew about these events. This book is meant to counter a certain revisionism and amnesia that has set in around history that seems so familiar to us.We learn some inconvenient truths. We learn that Winston Churchill was an anti-Semite; that he was a marginalized figure because of his early century political and policy failures; that he his feelings about colonial subjects of the British empire were by and large paternally racist; that he saw military intervention as a policy of first resort, not last; that he acted and saw the world according to what he wanted to believe, not based not he pragmatic reality he was faced with; and, as his non-response in warning the people of Coventry about a bombing he knew was coming, viewed people as chess pieces in a grand game, not as flesh-and-blood individuals.Bombing was, to Churchill a form of pedagogy\u2014a way of enlightening city dwellers as to the hellishness of remote battlefields by killing them.He was not alone in many of these ideas. Neville Chamberlain and Franklin Roosevelt were also anti-Semites who shared many of Churchill\u2019s views. We also learn that Roosevelt indeed engaged in many actions that sped up war in Asia and Europe. We learn that pacifists like Clarence Pickett\u2014to whom Baker dedicates Human Smoke\u2014the head of the American Friends Service Committee (Quakers), congresswoman Jeanette Rankin\u2014the only member of Congress to oppose U.S. entry into the war, and Muriel Lester\u2014a follower of Gandhi and a Christian relief worker\u2014were remarkably foresighted about the consequences of a world war. We learn that British bombing of cities in Germany started long before the German bombing of Britain. We also learn about unlawful acts of press censorship and intimidation that were practiced regularly by the Roosevelt administration.And while Baker has a point of view that evolves over the book (mitdenken!), he doesn\u2019t shy away from issues that are not clear cut. He revisits selections from the diaries  of Victor Klemperer. He provides example after example how a global anti-Semitism hindered attempts resettle Jews around the world, leaving most of them to die in the Holocaust. To his credit, Baker does not pass judgment, he just lets facts speak for themselves. We learn about common decency and bravery:In Antwerp, Jews were compelled to wear Star of David armbands. In solidarity, non-Jews in the city wore armbands, too. It was November 1940.And he also recounts stories of unimaginable brutality, such as the mother, when brought to Babi Yar, who threw her child in a pit of bodies, jumped on top of the child and laid still for hours after dead bodies covered them both, before both emerged to survive the war.In my opinion, Baker\u2019s efforts, in the end, did not sway me that pacifism was preferable to what actually happened during the course of the war. He refers often to Gandhi, who was fighting against British colonialism and was interned with Nehru and others for part of the war; who were \u201cjailed for public pacifism\u201d which was equated with being Nazi sympathizers. As much as many of Churchill\u2019s action repelled me, I am not convinced, as Gandhi concluded, that \u201cHitlerism and Churchillism are in fact the same thing\u201d or that \u201c[t]he difference is only one of degree.\u201d Nor does Baker ever convince me that nonviolent opposition to Hitler\u2014which might have caused a much greater death toll than the war produced\u2014was a viable alternative. But this \u201caccount\u201d does raise the stature of pacifists in my mind, especially Pickett, whose organization was shared a Nobel Peace Prize in 1947. He was a consistent voice who fought famine and injustice, opposed war, and did his best to serve refugees regardless of where they came from.Human Smoke is a fitting companion to Adam Hochschild\u2019s comparative history of British pacifists and the military in Word War I, \nTo End All Wars: A Story of Loyalty and Rebellion, 1914-1918\n. Much like that book, I feel I learned so much about a history I thought I understood well. And much like that book, I am as confused about what I would have felt and done if I were living through those times. Would I have had the intelligence, insight, and character to engage in constructive mitdenken?"}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/354760-david", "userReview": "The brilliance of this book lies in its restraint. Baker is not an academic historian, nor is he writing a work of conventional history. Thus, he has the good sense to make his historical argument--inasmuch as this book has an argument that you can pin down in the text--as obliquely as possible. Baker does not, as some critics would have it, say that World War II was a Bad War. Nor does he claim, as those same critics would have it, that Roosevelt and Churchill were morally no better than Hitler. He does, however, isolate facts about Roosevelt and Churchill that are consistently thought-provoking and occasionally embarrassing. And he does give voice to many pacifists who tried in vain to stop the war from coming (and tried to stop it sooner once it did come). In fact, the goal of Baker's book is rather modest: He wants simply to provoke readers into considering truisms about World War II in a new light. In this, he has succeeded very well."}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1526809-donna", "userReview": "I found Nicholson Baker's unflinching presentation of the events leading up to America's entry into WWII a moving reminder that getting the facts is a slippery matter at the best of times; in war it is impossible. This makes me think that since we're always either leading up to war or in war, we can never hold onto the facts or apprehend the truth which seems to live forever on a metal table dying of multiple stab-wounds. There were many moments in this book where I realized everything I knew was wrong. And this disturbed me, how newsreels seen in childhood with their plucky music and exploding skies could allow me to swallow the pattern whole; the template for many myths I never questioned. This book also helped me make sense of the Cold War, which I see now is a refinement of a half-century dedicated to making all out war against civilians acceptable. I was also struck, while I read this book, by a sense of observing the barbarism of another time, like reading about a Roman general lining a wide dirt road with a thousand severed heads on sharp sticks. But I recognize this as a dangerous illusion fostered by living in a new century. We are no different. The dedicated pacifists and non-resistants (given rare tribute in this book) know this all too well as they work to convince us that our baser selves are not human nature. That is propaganda. We are better than that, and we are capable of doing less wrong.Perhaps, like me, you have put yourself in that civilized club of the less wrong. You do not need such a lesson, and you would prefer such people stop their dull preaching.

This non-fiction discussion of the pre- and early war years is based entirely on published materials -- mainly newspaper accounts. In short, this is not a piece of original research; it is not an academic history. While the book is rich in detail, the details included are all aimed at one objective: presenting a pacifist narrative of the war, in which France did the right thing by not fighting back against the Nazis, in which Churchill's leadership skills and war strategy are called into question, and the United States entry into the war is presented as a mistake. Not surprisingly, this book has angered many WWII armchair historians and History Channel watchers, as its pantheon of heroes does not include any Allied combatants. Instead its heroes are those who resisted the war. For example, he praises the efforts of pacifists such as Clarence Pickett and Rufus Jones, who traveled back and forth from the United States to Europe preaching peace. Another figure that appears prominently in his account of the war is Gandhi, who also objected to US entry into war. This focus is not without its problems, especially when the narrative turns to the fate of the Jews in Europe under Nazism. Baker, relying solely on published contemporary sources, suggests that the Third Reich would have preferred to transport Jews to Madagascar as the 'final solution' than sending over six million European Jews to their death. In fact, although he does not shy away from including stories about atrocities inflicted on the Jews, he seems to suggest that American entry into the war forced the hand of the Nazis, so that the only option became mass murder! This presentation is problematic for multiple reasons. First and foremost, it seems to suggest that the forcible mass deportation of over 4 million Western European Jews from their homes is an acceptable outcome if it will prevent war. Second, it fails to take into consideration that Hitler's persecution of Jews started prior to the outbreak of war or the fact that Hitler authorized the killing of the disabled in Germany within one month of his attack on Poland. Given the involuntary \"euthanasia\" of mentally ill and disabled persons began before Nazi Germany experienced any significant outside resistance, there is no reason to believe that appeasement would have prevented an escalation in the systematic persecution of Jews, the disabled, political dissidents, gypsies, or any other group. It is an issue that Baker's pacifist narrative never seriously addresses and consequently at times, his version of pacifism verges on cruel and inhuman.Still, there are elements of this book that are deserving of praise. First, unlike many accounts written by nonprofessional historians, Baker's account offers a realistic portrayal of war in all its ugly detail. It glorifies neither American motives for getting involved in the war nor this country's actual involvement. What emerges is an accurate portrayal of the deep division in this country over if we should become involved in the European conflict and on which side. There were in fact many famous Americans, such as the founder of Ford Motor Company and Charles Lindbergh, who supported Nazi Germany and its policy, including its eugenics policy. What popular histories of WWII typically fail to mention is that many US states in the 1930s had laws that mirrored German eugenics laws on forced sterilization of the so-called 'feeble minded'. Thus, in its unflinching portrayal of the ugly side of war, it does succeed in raising many of the \"what if\" questions that deserve thoughtful consideration, but which in our contemporary glorification of the \"greatest generation\" often get buried."}, {"userName": "Books Ring Mah Bell", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/372363-books-ring-mah-bell", "userReview": "This book begins in 1892, with Alfred Nobel saying, \"Perhaps my factories will put an end to war even sooner than your congresses [re: World's Peace Conference]. On the day when two army corp may mutually annihilate each other in a second, probably all civilized nations will recoil in horror and disband their troops.\"Perhaps not, Nobel! That prediction was a big fat FAIL!The author then takes us into brief passages in time, quick mention of WW1 and onto the start of WW2. This turns out to be the whole style of the book, vignettes of a sort, glimpses into a person, place and time. There almost seemed to be a formula in place, like, \"(Insert name) (insert action) (insert possible results/response to action). It was (insert date)\".I totally expected to read, \"Hitler farted and Himmler passed out. It was June, 1940.\"The \"It was August 1938\", \"It was June 12, 1940\", got very redundant.

(yes, I know the title says \"the beginnings of...\")However, this tweaks me for a multitude of reasons:1. no mention of the of Atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki.2. no coverage of D-day (yes, that's been done in a thousand other books)3. missed the deaths of millions of Jews in concentration camps between 1942 to the end of the war.That to me, seems like a whole lot of Human Smoke.It seems like the beginnings of WW2 were more like \"Human Kindling\" or \"Human Tinder\"."}, {"userName": "Fred", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/226256-fred", "userReview": "Human Smoke: The Beginnings of WWII, the End of Civilization was a life-changing book for me.Using an all factual anecdote approach, Baker completely revised my thoughts on how WWII started, especially casting Churchill into a very gray figure and Roosevelt into a much more gray light than had ever been aware of.He enumerates the many people who opposed the war and sought to minimize the violence and deprivation wreaked on innocent people. This in itself reminded me of how out-of-favor and marginalized pacifists have become in the United States.For instance, though not from the book, Mothers' Day started out as a mothers for peace holiday. It's not only completely lost that emphasis, but I think people here now would be uncomfortable with it. It is incredibly sad that mothers wanting to keep their children from being killed, maimed, diseased, and starved in war seems to be a fringe sentiment."}, {"userName": "Jon(athan) Nakapalau", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58774673-jon-athan-nakapalau", "userReview": "A tapestry wove in hell and draped over the world."}, {"userName": "Colleen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125315-colleen", "userReview": "A big messy book, one that took me a while to read since like 600 pages, doing it in dribs and drabs daily (easy since each page is another step towards the Holocaust starting in 1892 in a very formulaic manner--\"It was July 4, 1933\", etc). I was actually reading this book when Charlottesville happened and comparing the Nazis today with the Nazis then is easy--nothing has really changed. If you are trying to find a super depressing book, well look no further, because this is it. I've put off this review for almost a month just because after reading this, I have so much to say on the topic and almost nothing at all at the same time. It champions the pacificists and the author \"I dedicate this book to the memory of the Clarence Pickett and other American and British pacifists. They failed but they were right\" and dear god is this book complicated--they failed because they failed completely. Everyone is a monster basically. Eleanor Roosevelt, I feel the author cherry picked a letter from 1918 with a bad party containing \"mostly Jews\"--ignoring everything else she did later in life (though her transformation from complacent wife & mother to human rights advocate happened later--and if that's the worst you can find from her writings well...), FDR freaking out that too many Jews at his alma mater and making sure there were quotas, Churchill who comes off as a bloodthirsty maniac, chortling on how the crowds were buying his pro-war bombast in a sucker born every minute moment (\"That got the sods, eh?!\"), Gandhi cozeying up to Hitler--and hell even the victims themselves. Reading how one Jewish Dutchman counseled his friend that their option was to just placidly kill themselves with no worry, because Anti-Semitism and Nazism would only last 5 generations so just shoot yourself and hope for a better morrow, or Gandhi with his 2 generation nonsense--look at the Civil War, that's been 6 generations with no let up on the hatred--look at just history--2 generations, 5, 10, 100--evil and stupidity know no bounds, and just dying and hoping that in like 75 years people will feel bad and know better seems dumb. I think of my cousin who teaches High School English remarking that her very best student upon reading Anne Frank's Diary reaction was a basic /meh. Too long ago, doesn't affect her at all, and had no sympathy. My cousin was horrified and I think about that kid now. For me, reading Anne Frank's Diary was a watershed moment as a child, where each time I read it, I hoped for a different ending. That no scary novel or movie or imaginative nightmare could ever equal the sheer horror of real life. I have no idea how you can read that book and not be moved, unless a total sociopath. I remember Holocaust survivors coming to my school & the JCC to talk about what happened and the faded tattoos. My grandparents completely changed by the War. My copy of Night is autographed by Elie Wiesel when I saw him as a teenager speak. I don't know how it's impossible not to care.I also don't know how it's impossible to NOT fight back, which is what this book champions. Granted, it's a book extolling pacifism, but to a self harming degree--one that both expects and praises laying down, putting your head on the chopping block or killing yourself and dying for a better future/cause, but by showing how EVERYONE is terrible--well what's the point of that? It ends with 1941 when the horror got seriously underway, and I think it almost has to. You can't carry on the pacifism/turn the other cheek really past that without some major dissembling or masochism taken to an extreme level.Leaving aside the obvious polemics of this book and how it feels like many of the testimonials have been especially chosen to show ALL SIDES BAD. Gandhi recommending England to surrender: \"Let them take possession of your beautiful island, with your many beautiful buildings. If these gentleman choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourself, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them.\" There's nothing the Nazis would have loved more than that! I think if there's a state run media or an indifferent complacent populace, then what's the point of laying down en masse and dying--no one will know or care, especially if they root for your deaths, which is what the other half of the book covers. The growing coarsening and grossness of public opinion which is where this book shines (and lots of spooky resonances for the present--people in 1930 would have thought the Holocaust was a laughable fantasy). If every minority now in US prisons was taken out and shot, you would have 25% of our populace cheering the fact and a large part of media willing cover that up. So many testimonials and news reports I had never read before--the creep of evil where slowly but surely (again starting from 1892 to 1941) of history where the unthinkable became not just doable but mass orchestrated by millions. And once again this book puts to rest the myth of \"We didn't know\"--because they knew, everyone knew--the many, many testimonials in this book bear it out, the sermons, the headlines, or in the taunts of \"children call each other names and say, \"You'll be sent to the baking oven.\" This book has far too many references to the mass murders of disabled people or hey! where did all the Jews go (not to Madagascar, which I never knew was a cover for concentration camps), and the press responses. If people had no clue what was going on they willfully shut their eyes and ignored it, much like we do today with the many atrocities across the globe. What do we make of the people then? What do we make of us now? However, leaving aside polemics, this book shed light on a lot of things I had no idea about, events currently in news today (well \"in news\" debatable--it's there, we just don't look)--like Yemen for example. I've shuddered at the pictures of starving children in Yemen in news lately and wondered why our government is helping Saudi Arabia with that, or hell just more in depth news on what is going on there, but hey! Here is 1934, with the RAF practicing dropping bombs on Yemen tribesmen, which helped out 9 years later as practice for bombing Germany. I didn't realize about UK vs. Iraq in 1941 where \"RAF flight instructors and their cadets made almost two hundred flights over the Iraqis on the plateau\" or in 1920 when Churchill advised to use on Iraqi tribes \"I am strongly in favor of using poisoned gas against uncivilised tribes. Most of those gassed wouldn't have serious permanent effects.\" I didn't realize how much of the 1920s and 1930s, US & UK did aerial bombing runs on the Middle East & India/Pakistan, a lot of it training wise, solely murdering for experience. There is a lot in this book about the America First (gross Lindbergh \"If only we could be on the right side!\") movement, semi-enabled by the Quakers and those who didn't see the point in interfering in a European war--genuine noble pacifists and extreme racists coupled together in ensuring that boatloads of children and refugees got turned back to Europe. Now the same America First people are in charge and reading those passages are sickening, especially considering how now there are more displaced people fleeing strife since WW2, and once again a populace unwilling to provide refuge. No easy answers in this book, no matter how hard the author pushes pacifism--and whether you are pro-punching Nazis or are willing to have them punch you--I think ultimately up to each individual person reading this."}, {"userName": "Roger", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1617139-roger", "userReview": "Uttterly brilliant so far (66 pages).

Accounts of Churchill, Roosevelt, Hitler, and various other prominent parties are occasionally punctuated by mention of pacifists active at the time, from Gandhi to Americans who refused the draft.Because so many of us unquestioningly accept the heroism of the Allied role in World War II, Baker has been accused of committing horrendous thought crimes in authoring Human Smoke. These include allegedly casting Nazis as moral authorities in order to disparage Churchill (see Adam Kirsch's review in the New York Sun). Nothing could be further from the truth. Baker takes care to lay out the horrors of the Nazi regime from well before their most heinous acts, taking the reader from an early Goebbels book-burning through the later mass shootings and gassings of the Jews. There is no question in Human Smoke that opposition to the Nazi regime was a moral imperative. The question Baker raises is whether Churchill in particular went about opposing Hitler in the right way.Baker lays out Churchill's strategies of bombing German civilians in order to lower national morale, and imposing a strict blockade that afflicted with sever hunger only refugees, occupied peoples, and particularly those trying desperately to stay alive in Jewish ghettos. He cites to Churchill's wife as saying Churchill was \"bloodthirsty.\" While there is never a question of who has the moral high ground, Baker suggests that the Allies used their moral high ground in order to move forward with an immoral means of achieving victory. He further suggests that peace would have been a better objective than victory.Human Smoke also suggests that Roosevelt provoked Japan into attacking the United States in order to get the U.S. into the war. Without addressing this suggestion (because indeed, it is only suggested by the vignettes Baker has chosen to present), the aforementioned New York Sun review argues that Baker \"allows the reader to imagine that America sold weapons to China for aggressive purposes, rather than to assist China in resisting Japanese invasion.\" Once again, this ignores the vignettes of Japan plague-bombing China, dropping bits of bubonic plague-infected material on Chinese civilians (among other Japanese hostilities). What Kirsch doesn't seem to get is that Baker is once again only questioning the inclination to use force as a response to atrocities, not the morality of the atrocities themselves.Read with a closed mind, Human Smoke may be considered revisionist; read with an open mind, it is clear that the important events are all there--it is only Baker's attitude that is different from most historians. His pacifistic perspective is unfortunately fairly unique as applied to World War II, but one can only hope that it will add to human understanding of one of the greatest tragedies in world history.For a thoughtful review, see the New York Times."}, {"userName": "Ruzz", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/916030-ruzz", "userReview": "an unconventional take on the genesis of world war II. To date, the most persuasive argument of the existence of \"war fever\", a hard to prove, but well documented part of the human experience. He redefined Churchill and FDR for me and despite the horrors of the nazi regime made a strong case for Hitler initially trying to contain the scope of war. Ironically, or not, the injection of the \"peace\" focused elements of the book from gandhi's ridiculousness on had the opposite effect I think was intended. While i was surprised to find there was as much activism at that time as there was it remained the infective hand wringing of \"higher\" selves who refuse to live in the animal world we currently occupy. The addition of their point of view added to my feeling that they offer nothing useful in avoiding war, or dealing with aggression. the simple truth of life is that we are animals competing for resources. and the cost is often conflict and death. This is natural and the violence is built into the system for a reason. To suggest we can simply wait out tyranny and aggression as no dictator, or violent regime can last is both naive and the very height of human hubris--wherein we use consciousness to elevate ourselves beyond the struggles and realities every other animal on the planet deals with daily. In a perfect world we'd find ways to prevent greed and war-mongering to define our political experience but we don't live in that world as well documented by FDR all but flying japanese fighter planes into Pearl Harbor himself. he set the table on every front for that attack, and then used it to turn America into a global super power. and in doing so, gave Americans a wonder of false moral imperative unparalleled till 9/11, and simultaneously set them on course to have decades of affluence to complain and suffer existential angst about. the real downside of this book for me was that it likely ruined band of brothers for me.

I've enjoyed his artistic fiction for years, but this nonfiction history is by far his best. As always, Baker writes in extraordinary depth and detail, this a sobering portrait of civilization from 1914-1941 ... if you call it civilized. And you may not when you finish the book. It is not one more story of the holocaust, or of isolated ignorance. It is not the stuff of movies. It is about truth and knowledge of historic events. Like Baker, I was born in the 50s baby-boom. And the world was still fragile, more than my family, teachers and elders ever let on. There was a \"Cold War\", and then Vietnam. In the early 80's when my children were born, Three-Mile Island brought back nuclear nightmares. The 1990s saw a holocaust in Bosnia. In 2001 when the World Trade Center was leveled by terrorists, the skies again filled with ashes and human smoke. After all these things have come to pass, now when my own children are of child-bearing age, how stable is this world, how civilized, what legacy do we baby-boomers pass on? Santayana wrote \"those who do not remember the past are doomed to repeat it.\" Which is why Baker is compelled to write, which is why we are compelled to read. Human Smoke is a book to remember. The human mind can hold and assimilate and disseminate, and the human heart can rise above false prophets. Baker challenges us to read and weep, to think and question, to repulse ignorance, to be civilized, bold and political, and hopefully find answers and purpose in these historic times."}, {"userName": "A.

Baker turns his detail-obsessed myopic little eyes to a very interesting question: Was pacifism a reasonable response to WWII, and were there any pacifists speaking up at the time? This are very difficult questions. A mature author, experienced in history and rhetoric, writing in a straightforward and persuasive manner, would have a very hard time addressing this topic. Alas, Baker has three problems:1) His book is a series of quotes and fragments of historical detail. Each shard of history is *followed* by the date. As if the fragmentation weren't challenging enough, we don't know what we're really listening to until it's over.2) I was listening to these exasperating fragments, rather than reading them. If Baker presents me with a book comprising the dust bunnies swept from under the bed of history, it'd be helpful at least to look at them.3) Baker is a remarkable observer and writer. As a philosopher or historian, however, he can never see the forest for the trees. More typically he can't see the trees for the microbes living in the lichen on them. This terminal myopia is charming in his first and best novel, \"The Mezzanine\", but even in that tiny novel about a 30-second escalator ride, Baker's lack of scope is irritating.

His research is presented to the reader in \"Human Smoke,\" gleaned largely from newspapers and radio transcripts of the times, which Baker felt had a \"rawer\" view of events compared with the distillation of professional historians. It is an interesting approach to a subject that has become a publishing industry in and of itself. Baker is very clear about his own pacifistic bias, and thusly he has presented a very different take on key historic figures and illuminated what were for me previously unknown events. I think \"Human Smoke\" may have changed my own view of Churchill, who comes across and a war-mongering anti-semite, but not the necessity of what has come to be called the Good War. Years of European conflicts, the slow death of colonialism, and the rise of fascism and communism all contributed to an inevitable collision that was in many ways a continuation of the previous wars, like most wars it seems.

The point was made by illustrating the futility of extreme violence, the pointless aggression of the people in control of the world's military strength toward civilians, and the inevitability of death. I felt that Baker proved that if violence is death, and pacifism is death, then it makes sense not to corrupt yourself in life by committing violence. You will die anyway.

I'll rate it if I do.I was prompted to investigate this book after watching two Penn Point episodes on the author, who is a favorite of Jillette. http://revision3.com/pennpoint/humans...The author being unknown to me, I elected to collect some reviews on the book. I was also motivated to find a review which addressed the allegations that Baker makes numerous factual errors in presenting his historical treatise (Penn also mentioned he was aware of these allegations, and suggested to his audience that they might wish to check that out, but I don't think he himself has, nor do I believe it would have made a significant difference to the power the book ultimately had over him).This review, by John Lukacs, was just what I was looking for: http://www.truthdig.com/arts_culture/...Based on this review, I'm not sure it will have much value for me. I stipulate to the emotional impact it had for Jillette. I'm an emotive person, and I'll conjecture it's likelihood to have the same emotional impact on me. I am, however, uncomfortable about the conclusions I might draw in the context of the facts as Baker presents them. I'm worried that I'm far too likely (especially given the likely emotional impact) to be misled by Baker's treatise, and probably in subtle ways that might sorely test my ability to detect self-deception.Lukacs' review suggests that Baker wrote this book in the way he did to express his pacifism. Perhaps a little shading of the truth, in Baker's mind, might be justified to drive home his philosophy.Lukacs suggests that there is some interrelationship to the motivations of Hitler, Roosevelt, Churchill, and the European Jews. His review delicately hints at the possibility that to some small degree, the Jewish resistance to Hitler before the death camps started, encouraged Churchill and Roosevelt to make war upon Hitler, and war thus being made, Hitler had an excuse to begin his genocide, as he lost the luxury of time and resources to follow other means of social control short of holocaust.Well, that idea is in the weeds, and it's my idea I got from reading the review, Lukacs doesn't spell it out.Lukacs justifies his review by setting aside Baker's motives, the \"Why?\", and focuses on the \"How?\" or how he wrote the book. To that end I learned that the book's architecture was flawed, it's source material suspect (mostly newspaper stories from the New York Times...Lukacs asks the reader to consider the trustworthiness of newspaper stories generally...I think it can be said of newspaper stories that factual errors are a given, and we could assume them innocent given the freshness of events, but that freshness also causes a distortion of perspective, which becomes clearer in the context of time and more information), it's style disjoint in a way which particularly lends itself to willful distortion, and some elements unabashedly fabricated (like the origin of the book's title).Given all of this, I have to say I must treat the book with prejudice. I am probably better served by treating it not as an historical treatise, but as a work of historical fiction (Baker is better known for fiction anyway) where liberties are taken with the facts in the aim of satisfying the dramatic ends of the author's vision.I have to ask myself, is that vision worthwhile just the same? Clearly it impacted Penn Jillette deeply, as he says in his videos. From this I infer Jillette is also a pacifist. I can't fault him for that. In fact, I laud him for that. If all humanity shared that view, there would be no war.I regard myself as a libertarian, as Jillette does himself. I take the view that war ought to be defensive, a reaction to protect property and resist coercion. In that context, the USA would have had to remain out of the war's fighting, restricted only to trade.Lukacs appears to suggest that history could have been different if Churchill and Roosevelt played defensively, protecting themselves only, rather than seeking to offensively destroy Hitler. Perhaps the Jews in Europe would then have become subjugated slaves to a new European order, but alive. Perhaps they would have died anyway. Perhaps they would have nearly all fled Europe, and (maybe?) exposed some anti-semitism in the allied nations as we would be confronted with the prospect of either welcoming refugees by the millions, or turning our own backs. A chilling thought: could we have fought Hitler to keep the Jewish problem \"over there?\"Well, that's all speculation, and that's the point. For reasons which can only be distilled to the summation of millions of individual values, motivations, and choices, the war WAS fought. Shock! Civilization did not end. But it did change. It would have changed even if there hadn't been a war.I hope my analysis is at least somewhat coherent. I was motivated to check out this book because a person I hold in high esteem recommended it. I now take the considered step of putting it back on the shelf without reading it because I am more interested in thinking about the motivations of people based on what they have actually done.I love Penn Jillette, a thoughtful and righteous man. And I think I also agree with Baker's point of view (as I infer it). I sum up my own view on stuff in general by simply saying that I'm always for voluntary choice, never coercion. The more widely that principle is applied, the better I think our experience of the world becomes."}], "description": "Human Smoke delivers a closely textured, deeply moving indictment of the treasured myths that have romanticized much of the 1930s and '40s. Incorporating meticulous research and well-documented sources-including newspaper and magazine articles, radio speeches, memoirs, and diaries-the book juxtaposes hundreds of interrelated moments of decision, brutality, suffering, and mercy. Vivid glimpses of political leaders and their dissenters illuminate and examine the gradual, horrifying advance toward overt global war and Holocaust.Praised by critics and readers alike for his exquisitely observant eye and deft, inimitable prose, Baker has assembled a narrative within Human Smoke that unfolds gracefully, tragically, and persuasively. This is an unforgettable book that makes a profound impact on our perceptions of historical events and mourns the unthinkable loss humanity has borne at its own hand.", "title": "Human Smoke: The Beginnings of World War II, the End of Civilization", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1948985.Human_Smoke", "average": 3.99, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1366341105l/1948985.jpg", "reviews": 260, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/15882.Nicholson_Baker", "name": "Nicholson Baker"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "War", "War", "Politics"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1948985.Human_Smoke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6348546-human-smoke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7182402-human-smoke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3534022-human-smoke", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/247000.The_Mezzanine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28229.Vox", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6364068-the-anthologist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28220.The_Fermata", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10108469-house-of-holes"]}
