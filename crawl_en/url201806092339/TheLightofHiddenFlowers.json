I probably shouldn\u2019t have read The Light of Hidden Flowers. I expect that many people will enjoy it, but it wasn\u2019t really for me. It\u2019s quite light and predictable. When I started it, I had just finished a very heavy book and something light seemed like the right thing. After a while, my need for something light waned as did my interest. Missy\u2019s mother died when she was four years old. She has always been close to her father and chosen a straight and unadventurous life, working in partnership as a financial adviser wither her father. Her father dies and leaves her a letter suggesting that she try a more adventurous life. At first, she is furious and then she starts to see that he may have a point. And off she goes on an adventure in search of a more meaningful life. There\u2019s also a lost love in the background, and a steady but dull current boyfriend. As I said, where this goes is quite predictable and I must admit to having only really scanned the last 20%. But I see that many of the ratings are fairly high and I expect that many readers will enjoy this book. Missy is quite likable and the underlying message is fine. But I\u2019m going to move on to something more quirky and meaty. Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advanace copy."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9077138-kelly", "userReview": "See this review on 1776books.net...http://1776books.blogspot.com/2015/08...What does it mean to really live? Are we meant to take life by the horns and suck every ounce we can out of it, or is better to just sit back and let others do it? In Jennifer Handford's The Light of Hidden Flowers, the answer is pretty clear, and the main character's journey to this realization is one that readers will love taking with her.Missy Fletcher is a partner in her father's financial firm. Frank Fletcher is Missy's only family member, as her mother died when Missy was very young and she doesn't have any siblings. A force to be reckoned with, Frank loves life, enjoys it immensely, and can't understand why his daughter is content to just sit in the background, going home every night to her Jeopardy reruns, Facebook lurking, and pistachio gelato. Missy's dream has always been to go to Italy, but her debilitating fear of flying has kept her grounded. When Frank develops Alzheimer's and ultimately passes away, it's a letter he leaves Missy that helps her to turn her life around, becoming more assertive, contacting a lost love, and even getting over her fear of the airplane to do something great.Not to sound all Oprah, but The Light of Hidden Flowers is one of those wonderful books that really makes you think about how you're living your own life. With characters you come to care about (especially Missy, who you'll be rooting for all the way), it's perfect for when you need a little pick-me-up.MY RATING - 4"}, {"userName": "L.A.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4055856-l-a", "userReview": "Posted first to Blog Critics as Book Review: 'The Light of Hidden Flowers,' A Novel by Jennifer Handford.In The Light of Hidden Flowers by Jennifer Handford, we are introduced to a touching and realistic relationship between a father and his daughter. Melissa Fletcher works with her father who she admires for his ability to garner trust and friendship\u2019s with his clients while at the same time seems to have a depth of memory in which to draw upon background information that helps solidify their trust. Melissa herself is more quiet and serene, working behind the scenes at their business, while helping to guide both her father and the others working in their financial offices.As her father\u2019s searing memory begins to falter, Melissa tries to help as much as she can. When his clients also begin to notice the decline, trust also begins to falter. Leaving the more demanding tasks of the business to his closest partner, Melissa can only do her best to help her father through the ravages of Alzheimer\u2019s. Becoming primary of the firm has never been her want, and yet it is thrust upon her when he passes.When she finds a letter from him, meant to sooth her she is only further troubled for on one hand he praises her for being dutiful and yet he also scolds her for not taking risks. Unable to put his words aside, Melissa heads for Italy where she meets a young woman who suggests a very radical idea.Melissa soon finds herself in India, searching for herself while putting together a plan of redemption and reconnecting with a lost love. Is her search really the answer to her father\u2019s dream or her own? She must pursue her dreams and take the risks that have always felt so out of bounds. Can she overcome her insecurities and become the woman her father dreamed her to be, and can she come to terms with her own dismay at his words?Handford takes us into the psyche of a young woman who has grown up in a sheltered world and been in the background of her father\u2019s life, unwilling to move from the protection. When she is thrust from her comfort zone and forced to face the world on her own she must draw from within to find what she finally understands is missing. Yet she must deal with anger and pain, self-doubt and insecurity pushing her own internal boundaries.The story of love, loss and growth is well written and grabs you from the beginning. You endure the heartache of the loss of a loved one and the journey of redemption. There is a great appeal to the reminder that we can follow our dreams, for it is never too late.If you enjoy contemporary fiction with threads of growth and loss, love and light, and an overall moral of determination you will find this a great work for your library. The beauty of thought leaves you searching your own dreams.This would be a great look for a Book Club or reading group. The idealism and questions garnered would create solid dialogue."}, {"userName": "Rob Slaven", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14011226-rob-slaven", "userReview": "I received this book free for review from the author or publisher in exchange for an honest review. Despite the privilege of receiving a free book, I\u2019m absolutely candid about it below because I believe authors and readers will benefit most from honest reviews rather than vacuous 5-star reviews.The spoiler-free nutshell on this book is that it is a coming of age story centering on a 35-year-old woman who spent her life as the nerdy bookish sort and never really got out of her shell to find out who she truly was. The story centers on her development as she breaks free of her usual well-worn rut and makes the life for herself that she always wanted.On the positive, side, the book displays a lot of positive role modeling for those of us who are a little less thrill seeking in our lives. Our protagonist pushes her boundaries and for the first time in her life does what she wants rather than residing in her fearful bubble. The prose is silkily smooth and very easy to consume in a few hours. You can gobble this one down in a few hours. The characters are consistent and well-developed.To the negative, there aren't really a lot of surprises in this book. It follows pretty much the path you would expect from beginning to end. If you want a book that challenges you are makes you think new and lofty thoughts then this isn't it. It's got a sure Lifetime made-for-TV movie feel to it but that is compensated for by the fact that it is so well polished and, perhaps in part, so easy to relate to for those of us who aren't pushing our own envelopes on a regular basis.In summary, this is a book to gobble down in a single long Saturday afternoon, perhaps with your feet up or swinging in a hammock. It won't teach you anything new but it may inspire you to try something new that you've been considering for a while.PS: I hope my review was helpful. If it was not, then please let me know what I left out that you\u2019d want to know. I always aim to improve. --- Free copy received for review"}, {"userName": "Rebecca (agirlirlblog, bekkilyn)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4912335-rebecca-agirlirlblog-bekkilyn", "userReview": "Missy Fletcher is a 35 year old woman, introverted, brilliant, and works with her dad in her dad's company as a financial analyst. Her mother died in an accident when she was four, and her dad is very extroverted, well-liked, and gregarious. Though she loves her dad, she tends to feel overshadowed by his personality. Though her dad loves her, he seems to feel that she would be happier if she came out of her shell and learned to take more risks. It seems that everything will go on as it always has until the day her father gets sick and passes away from the illness.Now Missy has to somehow learn how to be an adult, on her own for the first time ever.Usually coming-of-age stories are about children in their teens, so this book is more unusual in that it's happening to a 35 year old woman. \"Who is Missy, really?\" is one of the questions that Missy must discover now that she can no longer live as her father's daughter. Will Missy need to somehow turn into another version of her father, or can she better succeed by moving forward in her own way?I really enjoyed the way this book was written. It had something of a fairy-tale quality to it that I liked, though made no promises of happily-ever-after.

It is easy to fit in the skin of Missy, the protagonist. She reminds me of loads of ambitious young women, beautiful, intelligent and successful yet always pushing themselves to perfection, working to exhaustion, socially isolated, shying away from intimate relationships and dedicated to the care of their loved ones \u2013 and yet they crave for love and life but are too scared to just leave it all and go to taste what it is like beyond their comfort zone. In this book Missy at last managed to overcome her fear of life and love and achieves something wonderful. And this happens when sadly her wonderful super clever hero of dad has a stroke and becomes demented \u2013 again a sadness that a lot of us can associate with. It is her dad who prompted her to go for life and when he dies she does at last go for it.However too much of the book is about her secure and boring life managing portfolios of millionaires and surrounded by uninspiring men. I nearly tossed the book away at that point. I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t because at last she overcomes her fear and leaves and goes away to do something with all her knowledge and money. This experience opens her up emotionally and is at last exciting to read. I so much wished that this caring super woman would let more emotions enter her body and heart (and that it would infuse her writing) - but this wasn\u2019t to be. Alas her mind keeps her emotions under control and guides her emotionless pen \u2013 so much so that she doesn\u2019t even tell us what happens in the end when she finds love again with her college sweetheart after fifteen years of separation. However her charity work stands strong and for this I am grateful that she sets an example and shows how fulfilling this can be to both those who give and those who receive. I wish so much that many Missy out there with their heavy portfolios would follow Missy\u2019s example and enhance their lives in a similar way.

At thirty-five, she has a successful career as a financial adviser working with her father. She doesn\u2019t care for socializing after work or dating. She prefers her predictable life as it is, working and then going home alone. When she is introduced to Lucas, she decides to give him a chance and they start dating and get serious. But there is one man that Missy will never get out of her head, Joe, her high school boyfriend. What if they could have a second chance?When Missy loses her father to Alzheimer\u2019s, her world is turned upside down. She starts second guessing everything in her life. She decides to give into one of her biggest fears, flying. She takes a trip to Italy, a place she always wanted to visit. During the trip, she meets a young lady, Reina, who works for UNICEF. When Missy learns what Reina does, it sets her mind in motion. From Italy, Missy heads to India to meet with Reina again. Together they make life changing plans for some underprivileged girls and Missy finally finds a new life for herself and one that would make her father very proud.I thought the story was very well thought out and it is one that will stay with me for a long time. I enjoyed the reunion between Missy and Joe and how well Missy got along with Joe\u2019s daughter Katherine who needed a meaning in her life as well.

I felt sorry for Missy, it's super hard to get her father to acknowledge that he is having health issues, which does affect a few customers negatively at first. When the acceptance comes he is still stubborn and tries to do more than he is able, making Missy having to cover his mistakes.When the inevitable happens Missy questions her own life, and what she truly wants to do. That holiday to Italy sparked an incredible journey which led her to helping girls who desperately needed help to better their lives, and the lives of their families. It goes to show how 1 person (with others on the same project) can make a huge difference, even when the odds aren't stacked in their favour and they don't quite think everything through. Inspite of the heaviness of the story, there is a lot of humour which balanced the overall feel of the book. Missy's old and new friends made me smile, and were there to help when Missy was bombarded with problems. Missy's story is an inspirational read, so go find your passion and live it!

I found with this book that there were a lot of parts I enjoyed, and there were some that I found difficult to get through. While I enjoyed the character of Missy Fletcher, I found that the points of view of the different characters was not consistent~ there were parts where it conveniently flipped from a chapter with Missy, then a chapter with Joe. Then suddenly we don't hear from Joe for a long time, until we are nearing the end. As for Lucas, he is portrayed as very one-dimensional, and I felt overly done character traits. The other part that I had a hard time with was Missy's sudden turn from self-described workaholic, to suddenly deciding that she needs to do something more for the world. Yet, throughout her time in India~ both with Reina and Kate, I felt her heart was not truly in it.

Missy Fletcher is the kind of character a lot of people can relate with-someone with dreams but also trapped in the minutiae of a well-established life. The process by which she slowly peeled away the ties that bound her and ventured out into what she really wanted was very organic and very REAL-I think that's what made it so powerful, because I could see not just myself, but many people in her struggle to figure out who she was away from the shadow of her father's light. I loved the way her relationships developed-with Joe, with Kate, with Reina, and even with Lucas. I felt the latter was in some ways the most important of all, because it was the safest at a time when she was learning how to be dangerous.

There she meets a new friend who proposes a radical idea. Soon, Missy finds herself in impoverished India, signing away her inheritance and betting on a risky plan while rekindling a lost love.\"Sounds great, doesn't it? Too bad that's only an accurate description of the plot in the very vaguest of terms. Sure, she goes to Italy and makes a friend . . . who doesn't really propose any idea. And sure, she goes to India . . . where she \"signs away\" a fraction of her inheritance, and a pretty small fraction at that, on a plan that is presented as exceedingly complicated but not particularly risky and rekindles a lost love in the sense that she facebook stalks an old boyfriend. Oh, and then she goes back home a does some sort of stock market money managing magic or whatever ensuring that she doesn't actually spend a dime of her inheritance..If that doesn't tell you enough about what a disaster this book is . . . well, I've been wanting to write a rant-y review for going on three weeks. (another hint that a book is bad: when circumstances cause you to put it down for over a week and you're still dreading having to pick it back up when your schedule clears)The set up for the actual plot takes literally the first two-thirds of the book. Which would not be terrible if it didn't read like it was plot-setting-up-filler. And of course it goes without saying that when you finally get to the (sort of) interesting part it's rushed . . . and then it's over. Nothing is tied up, and while I don't mind open endings, this one doesn't end. It just stops.Missy, our main character, is a mess - and not in the way she was clearly meant to be. Nothing but a bag of contradictions because she had to be too many things. She has this decades long fantasy of traveling to Italy and taking a cooking tour of Tuscany, but she completely drops it after one chance encounter on an unplanned overnight layover in Sicily. Her expensive, month long vacation? Abandoned after, like, three days. Because . . . reasons? She's so afraid of flying that years before she tried to go and had to be escorted off the plane before it took off because she was having an epic meltdown, and all I could think of was why didn't she take a trans-Atlantic cruise if she wanted to go so badly but couldn't bring her self to fly? It's well established that she would be all over that, but apparently it never occurs to her. Mostly because the plot needs her to become a jet setter after just one successful trip. seriously, she boards the first plane so freaked out that she has to board the plane high on some prescription sedative that's the equivalent of, like, three dozen valium, and she's still only a few breathing exercises away from a panic attack, but we're supposed to believe that eight months later she's all about flying back and forth and popping over to Paris on the way back just because. Because the plot has her going back and forth between India and Virginia. So 200 pages of \"I CANOT NOT NOT NOT NOT GET ON A PLANE\" gets hand-waved away into \"I just took a few deep breaths and focused and oh look, yay, India!\" which . . . just . . . no. Does not work.Speaking of India . . . holy White Savior-ism, Batman! I'm sure both character and author meant well but the whole \"I've seen the light and I'm going to change the world because these poor backwards people just don't understand how important my new cause is so I will teach them and fix them\" thing just reeks. The actual plot is all about opening a school for girls in India, but the Indian characters are all minor, under-developed, and homogenized. I was decidedly not impressed.Also, Missy has a \"boyfriend\" who she feels absolutely nothing for, has to grin and bear every single date they go on (and only gets through them by downing a bottle of wine on every single one) and does everything he can to discourage her interests. He proposes to her by showing her a hypothetical joint tax return and saying it made more financial sense to get married than to stay single. Then he tells her she's wasting her life by taking care of her father who's had a stroke, has Alzheimer's, and is rapidly failing. Instead of kicking him to the curb and then some like any decent human being would do after comments like that, Missy says \"he's right, marriage would be financially beneficial, so even though I've admitted several times that I can barely stand being in the same room as this guy, let's save some money!\" And this is the character we're supposed to identify with and root for. She disgusted me from start to finish.(side note: the first time Missy and boyfriend have sex, while the scene is done in a \"fade to black\" style, it is clearly not consensual. She makes it clear she's not interested in that moment although possibly up to it after a little foreplay (or at least some showing of some sort of emotion from boyfriend) but he says he doesn't want to wait anymore and yanks her pants off . . . *cue fade to black* . . . also, ew. And again, she doesn't dump his sorry self right then and there. I kind of hate her for being such an idiot.tl;dr: girl dreams of going to Italy for twenty years. Highly medicates herself to get there. As soon as she gets there she leaves and never mentions her (literal) life-long dream again and is magically cured of her extreme phobia because India is a Magical Place for White Saviors.

Well...except for the financial genius part! Odd girl out growing up, being bullied, feeling \"less than\" all her life and having a parent rub your nose in it in their own well meaning way. I love that she finds her path in life and gets it all. Gives me hope and reminds me its never too late to reach for the stars."}, {"userName": "Sally", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2142895-sally", "userReview": "WOW!This was quite a book. It started out in a fairly predictable fashion, and then built layer by layer to point where I could not put it down; I had to find out what happened next.

I wouldn't consider it heavy reading, but there is a very worthwhile point to the story. Kind of a late coming-of-age story.
