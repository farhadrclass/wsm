(It was made into a Masterpiece Theater Presentation.)But in this collection of short stories she shows off her versatile range, writing about contemporary (Sixties)English women of privileged backgrounds who sometimes -- but not always -- find modern life in democratic, post-war Britain both exhilarating and empowering.MR. WRONG, the title story, is a chilling tale of murder and suspense worthy of Hitchcock at his finest. The heroine is a young woman of means, yet alone in vast and impersonal London she is easy prey for a satanic stalker with almost superhuman powers. The endless agony of suspense is almost worse than the ghastly conclusion. Definitely not for the faint of heart!But not all the stories in this collection end in sheer horror. In the sensual and tender TOUTES DIRECTIONS, a sheltered English miss engaged to a dull but suitable man takes a short trip to France, with entirely predictable results. The seduction of a prim and proper English girl by a skilled and knowing Frenchman is a concept that goes back centuries, but in this story the romance is fresh and modern and very, very sophisticated.It's interesting that Howard presents most of these women as being modern and liberated in the outward sense, smoking and drinking and having casual affairs, yet still subject to all the timeless tears and heartbreak of being a woman. Cynical and romantic, tender and scornful, perceptive and bitter, these stories of modern British women -- both in love and out -- are works to treasure."}, {"userName": "Kaethe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1072582-kaethe", "userReview": "I somehow missed writing this one up, so I\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdm backdating it on August 8. A piece of trivia: I hadn\ufffd\ufffd\ufffdt realized that Howard was married to Amis. Interesting marriage that would be.Now for the stories: \ufffd\ufffd\ufffddisturbing\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd comes to mind when you read the first one, and stays with you. \ufffd\ufffd\ufffdMr. Wrong\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is about a young woman, no life, who moves to London. She buys a second-hand car to commute and visit her parents, and discovers on her first trip that the car is haunted. There are shades of the Vanishing Hitchhiker in the way she picks up a young woman and a creepy man, but when she stops the woman has vanished. She comes to believe the car had something to do with the murder of another young woman (her\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds being the ghost) but is relieved to learn the murderer is picked up. She tries to sell the car, that seems ominous now, and the next time she goes home the murderer is in her car waiting for her: the police had got Mr. Wrong, but since she may realize what\ufffd\ufffd\ufffds going on, she must die. Otherwise the stories seem to be mostly about married people having affairs: they are exceptional only in their cruelty."}, {"userName": "Juliana Graham", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5921785-juliana-graham", "userReview": "A very diverse collection of short stories, some quite unsettling, others less affecting.
