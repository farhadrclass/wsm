I just finished \"The Iron Hunt\" by Marjorie M. Liu and it's very different from her 'Dirk & Steele' series. This is truly an urban fantasy, and a damn good one. The mysteries and the mystical pull you in and you can't stop reading until you find the answers to all the questions.Maxine is a Hunter. She hunts the demons that possess the bodies of humans. By day her demons are her protection--tattoos that cover her body and render her invulnerable. By night, her demons peel from her skin, leaving her with only her fighting skills and their proximity as her shields. This is her life and her lineage, the demons passed from mother to daughter through ages uncounted. But now 'the veil' is thinning...and Maxine may be the last Hunter...the only thing standing between humanity and hell.If you like dark paranormals and urban fantasy, don't miss this new series."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1216772-barbara", "userReview": "2.5 Stars (almost 3)...it was just okI really can't complain about this book, but sheesh I'm having a hard time saying I liked it even just a little...Like always Marjorie's writing is flawless...But I just didn't connect to the characters or the storyline. \"The Iron Hunt\" did get an extra star b/c of the basic weirdness/originality of the story...this lady has quite the imagination. There's little to no romance between the characters (As another reveiwer said \"The description is very misleading\")...What man changes everything?!We meet Grant (a former priest) who's already in a relationship with the main gal, so we don't get to see how they meet (I'm sure that will be told later on). I felt like that was one of the main reasons I didn't get the chemistry between the two. Then we meet Tracker; the strong mean silent type...Where (I'm guessing) he's going to eventually be Maxine's new found love at some point because there was chemistry between them.

Everything about it is terrible. I feel cheated of my time and robbed of my money.The plot is a simple one. In fact this would've served better as a novella because 300 pages was too many for what little was in them. And grammar nazis will have a fit, running out of red ink before they turn the last page.For a supposedly lethal hunter and fierce protector of the world against monsters and demons imprisoned behind a veil, Maxine Kiss was a pansy-assed pussy. I'm sorry for my crass language but I'm so Mad. She asked everyone questions and whether they be friend or foe she never received a straight answer. Meaningless riddles are not an answer. She threatened but never followed through. (\"You try anything, you even think about standing up, and I will have you shitting out of your dick so fast you'll beg me to rip it off.\" ~ Best threat) She just accepted these non-answers and moved on. To my frustrated consternation this happened repeatedly all the way through the book:Maxine encountered someone, they talk some shit and do a lot of implying, she'd question them, they'd deflect or give some vague and incomprehensible response. Kick some ass, woman! Where's this fierce warrior that's supposed to \"save the world\"? Because frankly if you're our saviour, then kill me now. Pathetic. And what the hell was she doing with someone like Grant? They live by such fundamentally different philosophies. Maxine kills the things that go bump in the night and Grant \"saves\" them. Slightly naive of him, if you ask me. Also, I'm not discriminating against the disabled here but if Maxine was going to settle down with anyone, shouldn't it be with someone who has the ability to run for his life? Otherwise, they're just cannon fodder. There's no way for him to keep up with her or effectively fight by her side. His flute would be no match for angry demon hordes. I found none of the characters likeable, unless you count homeless teen Byron who was turned into a pitiable creature. Maxine was unkillable. It was absurdly cartoon-ish the way she was run over by a bus and got right back up again, completely unharmed. I wonder if she's hardy against poison and disease. Please, someone try it.For someone slapped with a violently pro-active personna she did absolutely fuck all. All growl and no bite. The original premise was a good one but unfortunately it was poorly executed. By the end I still didn't fully understand what had changed from the beginning. It's taken me four excrutingly long months to finish this and that's with skimming.On the 12th April I said:\"Iron Hunt sucks! I will congratulate anyone who managed to finish it. Those who gave this book 5 stars is not my friend. I've just offended 181 people but I don't care. I hate every character so far except maybe this homeless teenager who's probably just a flash in the pan. It's frustratingly slow and sparse on the background details. Good bits are few and far between. It's a challenge read so I have to finish. Stupid challenges.\"I stick by this statement but to any future friends who may have rated this 5 stars, I'm sorry but we may just have to go our separate ways."}, {"userName": "Brownbetty", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/274033-brownbetty", "userReview": "At once a reasonably good book and somewhat disappointing. Maxine Kiss, (oh dear) is the latest in a long, lonely line of female demon hunters. Protected by a pact with a group of demons who live on her skin as tattoos, Maxine knows that one day she, like her mother, will be abandoned by the demons who protect her, in favour of her daughter. On that day she will inevitably die, suddenly and violently, when the demons she hunt get their retribution.It sounds promising, and in so far as it goes, it delivers, but the book is so clogged with backstory, suppressed memories, mysterious visitors, and romantic interests with magical powers that I thought I was reading book two. (I checked the author's webpage: I'm not.) The reader is simultaneously introduced to Maxine's heritage, and the reveal about how much of her heritage has been concealed from her, with the result that two potentially interesting stories become one confusing and dull one-- we need to learn what Maxine believes to be true before we can care that it's false, but when you already know it's false, there's not much point in learning about it.If this author is taken severely in hand by a merciless editor, she will produce pretty good books."}, {"userName": "Lexxie (un)Conventional Bookviews ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3651677-lexxie-un-conventional-bookviews", "userReview": "Quite different from what I expected based on the summary, The Iron Hunt is a story in which all kinds of secrets are being kept very close to the vest by most characters, and thus, the whole storyline and plot became a little dis-jointed to me.This and all my other reviews are originally posted on my blog  (un)Conventional Bookviews"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2276205-kelly", "userReview": "\"When I was eight, my mother lost me to zombies in a one-card draw.\" That's the first sentence of Marjorie M. Liu's The Iron Hunt, and it's just about perfect as opening lines go. It's the primary reason I bought the book. Not only does it draw the reader in, eager to find out how and why this happened, but I'm also pretty darn sure it's an Angela Carter reference. I love Angela Carter. It would be misleading to suggest, though, that Marjorie M. Liu sounds like Angela Carter throughout The Iron Hunt. Liu has a different style, one all her own. I loved it. Liu's style is unusual and won't be to everyone's taste. However, I found it visceral and poetic at the same time, and especially good when describing violence and magical visions. A couple of examples: \"I tried to hold her to me, but she slipped away, and zombies took her place. So many. Shoulders broad as mountains. Packed tight. Breath hot. Stinking with sweat and winter wool. I could not see faces for shadows, but the zombie in the suit leaned close. Crooked his finger like a hook.\" \"Waking dreams. Walking dreams. Swift dreams, black and white like old scratchy movies tinted and blurred with age. I dreamed in sparks and moments, and saw women in moonlight, pale as snow, hair as black as a raven's wing--steel in their hands, always, sword bound, hair bound, in sunlight, tattoo bound--and I flew with them, I ran, and their bodies merged into one, a woman large as thunder, with eyes like the starry night, and wolves at her back.\" Another aspect of The Iron Hunt that worked well for me was the mythos. Liu blends the myths of many cultures into her story, mixing Sumerian, Asian, Celtic, and Greek in a way that never feels forced or awkward; instead it gives the reader the sense that all of these cosmologies are valuable but incomplete shards of one vast long-forgotten whole. Liu's Seattle is painted in--I'd say vivid color, but this is Seattle, so it might be more accurate to say rainy grays. There is a real sense of place in The Iron Hunt. A small gripe, and this may be a case where the cover-blurb writer sold the novel writer short: there isn't really a romantic subplot. The blurb gives the impression that this is a major focus of the story when, in fact, the heroine and the love interest are already involved and their relationship is written more as background than as plot. I gather that this romantic subplot was actually resolved in a previous short story by Liu. It's not so much that the novel *needs* a major romantic plot; it's just that it was weird to find the plot quite different from the blurb. The real plot has more to do with Maxine's discovery of new and frightening powers and her growing awareness of her mother and grandmother's history. I highly recommend The Iron Hunt to anyone who likes urban fantasy, tough female characters, and unique prose. I will definitely be looking up more of Liu's work while I await further installments in the HUNTER KISS series.

It took a while for me to get into it, but halfway through I was completely engrossed. However, by the time I got to the end, I was also completely confused.I love good worldbuilding, and Liu has built an intriguing mythology with this series. I don't like books with infodumps that introduce you to the world all in four paragraphs at the beginning, and luckily, The Iron Hunt isn't one of those books. My problem, though, is that Liu never really gives a clear picture of the world through the showing (as opposed to the infodump telling). She tosses hints through riddles and visions, but I had trouble putting everything together and buildling a clear mental map of the different planes of existence.The only consolation I take from this is that Maxine Kiss, the protagonist, seems just as confused as I am. I'm hoping this means that in future books in the series, as Maxine's understanding of the world grows, the reader's will as well. I see that as the sign of a great writer, and I know that I love Liu's writing style and incredible imagination. I suppose I'll have to read the second book to see if that's where she's heading.Speaking of the writing style, I do have to admit that it took a while for me to get used to the very choppy first-person narration. Maxine seems to think in short sentences and fragments, and that's hard for me to read. It's not fluid, and my brain stumbles over it. After I got used to it, though, I realized that it works for Maxine. It suits her aloof personality, and when her narration shifts into longer, more descriptive sentences, I could really feel her character changing.I'm left with kind of a conundrum here. I did enjoy the book, but at the same time, I feel like the book didn't give me enough. I'm hoping that the rest of the series will shed more light on the incredibly intricate world and Maxine's complicated place in it."}, {"userName": "Summer", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2274107-summer", "userReview": "I seem to be going through quite a few books that I DNF (do not finish).

Maxine is a Hunter,from a long line of Hunters,tasked with keeping demons in check. She\u2019s settled into tenuous comfort with her boyfriend Grant,former priest and so much more,and enjoys helping out at the soup kitchen and shelter that he runs. He veneer of normality that Maxine has cloaked herself in is shattered when she is accused of the murder of a private investigator. Her name is on a piece of paper found in the dead man\u2019s pocket,and Maxine has no idea who else could know of her identity. Her investigation will lead her to a man who may have much to do with her past and creatures that hint at the possibility of a coming apocalypse.The Iron Hunt opens with this line \u201cWhen I was eight,my mother lost me to zombies in a one-card draw.\u201d Sucks you right in,yes? It certainly caught my attention,and I ended up staying glued to the pages. There\u2019s trouble brewing beyond the veil,and things not of this world are pushing through to this reality. What begins with the murder of a private investigator turns into a search into Maxine\u2019s soul,and her past. Maxine is a tough girl,make no mistake,and her tattoos are,um,unusual. During the day,they are her armor. When I say armor,Maxine can get hit by a car and she\u2019ll be right as rain. That\u2019s some serious armor. At night,the tattoos come off and coalesce into five seriously rough and tumble little demons. Zee seems like the alpha guy of the group,and the only one that Maxine actually speaks with. They\u2019re a charming lot,and I found myself falling in love with them as the book goes on. I mean,these little guys can devour a baddie in seconds,like to cuddle teddy bears (well,pieces of teddy bears),eat tools and other various non-edibles (somehow the author makes this charming,seriously),and will do anything to keep Maxine safe. Ms. Liu\u2019s writing is sharp and immediate,and the action hardly lets up. I also like her concept of zombies. We\u2019re not talking the shambling undead here. \u201cZombie\u201d is used to describe humans inhabited by demons. Maxine is convinced the lot of them are up to no good,but Grant is convinced they can change,and he just might have the ability to make that happen. In fact,there\u2019s way more to Grant than meets the eye. This is just another one of the stunning discoveries Maxine will make during the story. She knew Grant had some magic,but just how much remains to be seen. Her devotion to him is unshakeable,however,and her strength,tempered with an aching vulnerability are part of what make Maxine a heroine to root for. The author has a wonderful way with words,and has created a world rich in mythology,ghosts,demons,and plenty of darkness (although there is light at the end.) Her imagery is immediate and the twists and turns don\u2019t stop! I highly recommend this series to any urban fantasy fan,and can\u2019t believe I had it sitting on my shelf for so long!"}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/142026-mary", "userReview": "The second paragraph of the jacket copy (I've included the complete copy at the bottom of this post for reference) is too vague and describes a very different type of plot.

This book introduces you to all the characters and given what you need to love them, along with the fast pacing to keep you going. The book is VERY well written to make me love and hate the characters with Maxine as we go through the story. I loved how there are many different demons and creatures. By the end of the book, I felt I knew the characters well, but had many curiosities of them. My curiosities were not from a lack in the story, but more of my thinking on the characters afterward. Where they are from and what they could truely be capable of.There are things here that Marjorie lays out for you to foresee in the story, but there are so many unpredictable happenings, and appearances as well. You get pieces of the plot to puzzle together as the story goes and it keeps you wanting more. I didn't want to put the book down. Another great book where I tried to make stopping points but just could NOT find one, I had to keep reading to find out what happens and what creature am I going to meet next.I do have to mention the '80s references ~ on the radio and tv reruns. The references are in no way over done. I enjoyed the subtlety of them, since I too am an '80s lover.One of my favorite characters in the book were the tattoos. I loved the WHOLE idea with/of them. The way they live, protecting Maxine both day and night in different ways. The way they help guide Maxine even when they are sleeping. This is an amazing creation that I look forward to reading more of.The only thing with this story was I felt, in the first fifty pages or so, I had missed some information. Maybe I missed a story that preceded this book or maybe this is information that is left open to be discussed in future books. Either way it did not hinder the book in any way and keeps a little mystery in the book and future installments for me.In the end, I loved this books' plot and the characters.

I love the demon tattoos. I like that the romantic interest is disabled - so rare to find people of various physical abilities in books. As others have mentioned, I love the opening line: \"When I was eight, my mother lost me to zombies in a one-card draw.\" And I love the whole scene leading up to the sword.What I couldn't really get comfortable with was the writing style. Lots of choppy sentences, which have a place in action scenes, but for the whole book gets annoying. Maybe because of this, the plot gets hard to follow: the actual villain is identified as such about halfway through, characters are introduced with little or no explanation (ever), and much of what happens is told through sensory impressions. As a writer I understand the concept of \"show, don't tell,\" but at times it was hard to follow what was metaphorical versus what was actually happening. Maybe it was just me, but based on other reviews, I don't think so.Still, I can see why this book will appeal very strongly to some readers. As urban fantasy goes, it's a creative, new, and fun addition to the cannon. Maxine Kiss is a heroine worthy of her predecessors Anita Blake, Mercy Thompson, and Kate Daniels. She kicks butt and has a heart of gold. She rises to the challenges presented to her and respects her long and honored heritage.That said, Maxine is also a lot of urban fantasy heroine tropes: she's a reluctant alpha heroine, cynical and world-weary, hungry for human connection but reluctant to let her guard down. Nothing new here.Liu has created a well-built, well-thought out fantasy world that I very much looked forward to diving into and exploring. And, while I'm glad I did, I thought this novel was a bit rough. The writing style is exhausting, the MC tropes are overdone, and I wish the rules of this world had been clearer. Yes, \"info dumps\" are bad, but we the readers need some explanations. I'll see if the next books in the series grow and mature with Liu as a writer.

Je ne sais pas si c'est tr\u00e8s clair c'est assez difficile \u00e0 exprimer.Pour ce qui est de l'histoire on d\u00e9couvre Maxine une h\u00e9ro\u00efne \u00e0 l'apparence si forte et pourtant si vuln\u00e9rable. Vuln\u00e9rable par l'amour qu'elle porte aux gens qui l'entourent, \u00e0 son besoin d'aider, aux questions qu'elle se pose. C'est int\u00e9ressant de la voir \u00e9voluer tout au long de l'histoire, de comprendre que parfois il faut aussi \u00eatre intransigeant. J'ai eu un peu de mal \u00e0 visualiser Grant, je n'arrive pas \u00e0 le voir physiquement, peut-\u00eatre est-ce du \u00e0 la traduction fran\u00e7aise ? Je ne sais pas vraiment... Tous les autres personnages sont vraiment int\u00e9ressants, ils apparaissent petit \u00e0 petit et on apprend \u00e0 les conna\u00eetre au fil des pages. On reste cependant en retrait, et malgr\u00e9 nos questions, celles de Maxine, on en apprend que tr\u00e8s peu. C'est une situation assez frustrante. Durant tout le livre on ne se pose que de plus en plus de questions pour finalement n'en avoir que tr\u00e8s peu de r\u00e9solues. Et quand finalement tout s'amorce, la fin arrive nous laissant plein d'interrogations. Je pense qu'on comprend tout en m\u00eame temps que notre h\u00e9ro\u00efne, le soucis c'est qu'elle ne sait pas grand chose du coup il en va de m\u00eame pour nous. Je crois que le personnage dont j'esp\u00e8re en apprendre plus est Oturu, il est myst\u00e9rieux, diff\u00e9rent, tout sauf humain de par m\u00eame son apparence physique si atypique. J'esp\u00e8re conna\u00eetre plus de choses sur les origines de chacun, sur Jack, les d\u00e9mons... J'ai vraiment beaucoup aim\u00e9 ces petits d\u00e9mons, il font partie de Maxine et en m\u00eame temps ont leur propre volont\u00e9. L'id\u00e9e m\u00eame des tatouage prenant vie \u00e9tait vraiment originale et j'ai beaucoup aim\u00e9 le concept.J'ai donc bien aim\u00e9 ce livre dont j'attends de lire la suite avec grande curiosit\u00e9. Malgr\u00e9 tout il est vrai que quelque chose m'a un peu d\u00e9rang\u00e9 sans savoir quoi exactement.

Her tattoos are her protection \u2013 during the day they form her armour against all threats, while at night they slip away from her and become \u2018the boys\u2019, small demons who are inextricably linked with the female line of Wardens. In The Iron Hunt, Maxine discovers that the Veil is falling as she investigates the death of someone trying to trace her \u2013 someone who knew her real name, and not the many pseudonyms that she gives. The threat of demons and worse coming through the Veil forces Maxine to use awesome powers that she has little understanding of or control over, and the whole world is at stake.Marjorie M. Liu has created a disturbing, compelling and unique vision of a world spiralling into darkness. The tattooed Wardens are mysterious, and the manner in which their demonic protection hides in the form of tattoos during the day was genuinely fascinating to me. I adored the five demons who protect Maxine \u2013 they are terrifying effective as they eat the souls of demons, all spikes and attitude, but are also enormously cute as they purr like dangerous cats when Maxine offers them Snickers bars!Liu\u2019s prose is also hypnotic and lyrical, with poetically beautiful passages such as the following: \u201cThe demon tilted his head, just so, and his body twisted, flowing like the skim of a shark through water. He danced when he moved; on the city street, wrapped in shadows: a kiss on the eyes, a devil\u2019s ballet, and only his feet moved, only his cloak had arms; and his hair, rising and flowing as though lost in a storm.\u201dUnfortunately, for me, the excellent premise of the novel and the delicious prose were ill-matched by a plot that stumbled and lurched from one incident to another. Half the characters were introduced with absolutely no discernable reason \u2013 those that did have a reason for joining the party were sketched so briefly that I didn\u2019t care about them.The plot was confusing \u2013 I know some writers who effectively carry their readers through moments of confusion, but Liu was not able to achieve this. I found myself more frustrated than thrilled, which is a great shame to me since I did feel that there was the bones of an excellent urban fantasy tale here. Perhaps now the scene is set, Liu will push on in the second novel of the trilogy (Darkness Calls) and ensure the plot moves more smoothly. I am tentatively willing to pick it up and give it a go, but it is most certainly not going to be at the top of my reading list."}, {"userName": "Gwen Mitchell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1379372-gwen-mitchell", "userReview": "Well, it's been quite some time since I read this one, so bear with me. Initially, the premise put forth in that first little blip was enough to snag me. And then, of course - hello? - cover awesomeness. Tattoos that become demons . . . sweet. Then there was the fact that I read Ms. Liu's novella 'Minotaur in Stone' in the Hotter Than Hell anthology and was severely impressed. And I'm hard to impress. So, on to the Iron Hunt.Unlike a few other reviewers I've read, I haven't read the Dirk and Steel series, so I didn't really have any expectations other than for the writing to stand out as it did in the anthology. From that aspect, Ms. Liu does not disappoint. What can I say? I'm a sucker for good writing and she is simply masterful with prose in a way that galls me to the bone with envy. I simply get lost in her words, her imaginative metaphors and the way she can evoke images and emotions like she's plucking heart strings if you let her. This was one of those rare books where I did not skip a word - not a single one, because I had never, ever read anything like it.Add to this hypnotic prose a story rooted in deep ancient myth, with references that - I'll admit - made me feel under-educated, but left me no less captivated, as well as a crew of characters that were refreshingly UNIQUE and I was a gonner for the day and a half it took me to devour it.As far as the story goes, it followed no conventions, and that in and of itself is what I value. Much of that is due to the characters. Maxine is a reluctant but tough hero, determined to get some happiness of her gritty life, which she already pretty much knows is scrapped. Her journey takes her into the past (literally) and into other dimensions, where she hits rock-bottom (again, literally) and finds out what she's really made of. Her boyfriend Grant is softspoken and gentle, with a fascinating gift, able to charm those unfortunate souls being fed upon by demon parasites and in some cases even rehabilitate them by playing his pipe. And the boys . . . well, let me just say that I wish I had some of my own. Even though they barely spoke, they were ever-present, and well-loved by the time the story was through. Even Maxine's mother and grandmother managed to capture my attention and curiosity, simply through memories. Not to mention a demon with blades for feet, who you're not sure is good or bad, but he makes the hair on your arm stand up either way; and an intriguing, reluctant immortal protector (with a backstory I simply must find out more about) who makes his first appearance by pushing Maxine in front of a bus. (I know - you'll just have read it to get what I'm saying.)"}, {"userName": "Cherry Mischievous", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1150670-cherry-mischievous", "userReview": "I was reading this book at about the same time as Dead Witch Walking (DWW) by Kim Harrison. I was reading The Iron Hunt at home and Dead Witch Walking in work. By the end of the week I had to think for a moment to figure out which character belonged to which world! The two books are quite similar :) This book is pacier than DWW though. DWW was a very slow starter. This one draws you right into Maxine's world. One thing I regretted doing at the start, was reading the prologue. That took a bit out of the reading enjoyment because the prologue throws the reader right into the middle of the fracas before the world building so it was slightly confusing. So if you haven't read this book yet, don't read the prologue before reading the story. Read it at the end. The story telling quality while good is not quite a masterpiece, a 3.5 out of 5. There were parts where the author dragged the drama out in a drawn out overkill which was annoying. It was so overdrawn that it almost presented the main protagonist as \"stupid\" that she just couldn't \"get it\", bordering on irritating, instead of the intellegent and kick-ass chick that she is portrayed to be in the book!The story itself while not original, I still find it quite good and enjoyable. Ms. Liu puts a nice spin to a well-used tale. I'd give it a 4 out of 5. However... the thing about the story is... if Maxine Kiss (heroine) is a one-woman defender of the human race team, why is she travelling only around the US? this begs the question of:a.) Does that mean that the US has the highest concentration of demons, enough to warrant ignoring the rest of the world?b.) The rest of the world is not considered human enough to be saved?c.) It wasn't really a well thought-out plot, and here the snags are showing...There are also two main \"central issues\" or, \"central dilemma\" if you will, to the story. One, is Maxine's journey to self-discovery and burgeoning powers and, second, is the first \"demon from the veil\" encounter in Maxine's lifetime. The second \"central dilemma\" was satisfactorily closed with the ending with a bang. While the first \"central issue\" seems to be an ongoing process. The ending therefore closed the book but also left it hanging. This took the steam off the climax of the story. I would give the ending a 3.5 out of 5.Overall, I think this is still a wonderful start to what is looking like a worderful series! I enjoyed this book and would read another Marjorie Liu work again. I'd give this book a 3.5 out of 5.Cherrywww.cherrymischievous.com"}, {"userName": "Donna", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2173872-donna", "userReview": "Maxine Kiss was raised by her mother to be a loner and a nomad, moving place to place, keeping to herself, having no friends outside of the boys. The boys are her living tattoos that she wears on her body by day, they peel away at night to become her personal, demon protectors that she lovingly calls \"my boys\". Maxine is from a warrior race of demons created long ago to guard the humans from the demons and zombies. She is the last of her line and they call her The Hunter.Going against family tradition, Maxine has put down some roots with Grant Cooperon, who has a few special gifts of his own, in Seattle, Washington at the Coop, a homeless shelter owned by Grant. Grant is also a former priest. Maxine has some trepidations about about living with Grant but she loves him and can't keep herself from not staying with him. In Maxine's own words: \"Grant Cooperon, my magic bullet. And it was going to kill me one day.\"Maxine senses that the veil, a prison created ten thousands years ago to imprison the most dangerous of demons, has opened and something evil has slipped through the cracks to earth's realm. Maxine has to find out what slipped through, before it finds her.I love the way Marjorie M. Liu writes, her words are like poetry, the way they flow off the page. It was a treat to read The Iron Hunt coupled with Ms. Liu's writing style and an introduction into world of demons that is a rare one with many dimensions to explore. I enjoyed the closeness and companionship that Maxine shares with her boys. The romance in this story is very subtle, the love shared between Grant and Maxine is unquestionable from the very the start. Which I think is refreshing to see the protagonist in a solid relationship throughout the story. Maxine Kiss is a strong, warrior through and through but she is also kind, she has a softer side.This is a read that requires your full attention because there is so much going on every page. At times the story can be dark and bleak. The Iron Hunt is an engrossing, solid story with action throughout it's pages. The end ties up the major plot point of this story but leaves a lot questions needing answers. Most of those questions are answered in Darkness Calls.The Iron Hunt has a prequel Hunter Kiss, a novella in the Wild Thing anthology.

As the last of the mortal demon hunters she has trained her entire life to destroy the evil that threatens the world. Her only friends the demons that protect her. By day the demons, or \"the boys\", cover her body as intricate tattoos that they form to cover her as if being encased in steel. By night, they are her personal body guards, doing everything in their power to help her fight the ones that threaten her and her world.After losing her mother Maxine decides she wants more than the lonely existence her heritage has bestowed on her. Grant, the only person who knows her for her true self, is the person Maxine does not want to give up. Grant has a few tricks himself, like the ability to use music as a tool that can shape and mold the emotions and desires of those around him. What Maxine sees in him is an amazing person who wants to change the lives around him for the best.Now Maxine has come up against a situation that leaves her looking for answers in unsuspecting places. The veil, or the layers and boundaries that have been in place for centuries to keep the demons out and the humans safe, is weakening. With the help of Grant, \"the boys\" and a few bizarre alliances Maxine is on a mission to carry on her legacy and fight the battles as they come.Marjorie M. Liu has a unique style of writing that unfolds the plot in a way that has you wanting more but keeps dangling just enough in front of you at a time so that it isn't an overwhelming amount of information at once. The plot for THE IRON HUNT is filled with twists and turns and the world is nothing like anything else I have read thus far. I am looking forward to picking up the next in The Hunter Kiss series, DARKNESS CALLS, and the upcoming release of the third book, A WILD LIGHT, coming out in July 2010. I truly enjoyed the main character, Maxine, in seeing both her strengths and her vulnerabilities.

The demons have been held in a prison dimension for thousands of years but there have always been a few who manage to escape and walk among us by taking over human bodies. Maxine's family fight these demons (who they call zombies) and their powers are passed down from mother to daughter. Maxine is protected by 5 demons who she affectionatley calls \"the boys\" who are magically attached to her body in the form of tattoos during the day but who come to life at night leaving her body vulnerable. The prison is becoming weaker and where only the less dangerous demons inprisoned in the outer edges of the prison could break through before Maxine now finds she has more powerful enemies to contend with. It appears that the prison is about to fall completely and the only thing standing between us and hell on earth is Maxine.I was hooked on The Iron Hunt from the very first line of the prologue \"When I was eight, my mother lost me to zombies in a obe-card draw.\" Well that definitely had my attention! The story is told in first person from Maxine's point of view and we get to join her on a voyage of discovery as she learns about her heritage. At times this could be a little confusing but I enjoyed learning things alongside the heroine and it made it easy to relate to the feelings she was experiencing.There was an interesting mix of characters - I absolutely loved \"the boys\" and I'm curious to find out more about Maxine's human boyfriend Grant who has some very interesting musical abilities that I hope we will get to find out more about. I'm also curious Tracker and interested to see what part he may have to play in the series.

Maxine Kiss is a demon Hunter, the last in existence. She's decorated by tattoos that by day are her armor, but by night peel off her flesh to become little demons who are her protectors and her only family. She calls them her \"boys\". Together they are the only thing standing between the good people of Earth and the demons breaking out of \"the veil\" a metaphysical prison they were put in thousands of years ago. There were a few things I really liked about this book. The original concept, definitely. Maxine's relationship with \"the boys\" - they're like very vicious, but endearing & highly intelligent talking pets. But there was a TON I didn't like. First of all, there's a lot of confusion on the part of Maxine. She doesn't have a grasp as to what's happening to her. What is she exactly? How is this person related to her? What is that person's loyalty, etc? And because SHE'S confused, the reader is confused, too - at least I was. It's okay to have a couple of things in question, but in this book it seemed like EVERYTHING was in question and it was just too much. I also just didn't care about Maxine or her romantic relationship with Grant. Maybe there just wasn't enough background written into them. Or emotion. Their relationship was too dry. I do think that, because of the concept, that this series has potential, but at this point I don't know if I'll buy the second book.I normally like to give a couple similar series, but this time around nothing jumped out at me.

A better synopsis, but I spent most of the time I was working through this book back-tracking trying to figure out what I had missed. Were there lines I needed to be reading between perhaps? Liu is a great author, she has a wonderful imagination, but there was something missing in this story. I later found out part of that may have been because the story actually begins in an anthology. Some readers may like this but I found it to be a stumbling block. Why should I be forced to go out and buy an anthology so I could get the first chapters of this new series? I tried to like it. I was very interested in the demons and how they came to be passed to Maxine and her maternal bloodline before her. Unfortunately very little was explained to help this part of the story along and while there were secondary characters I wanted to know more about and see more of I ended up finding Maxine herself to be a bit too two-dimensional for my tastes as a reader.

You will need to read Hunter Kiss first in order to fully understand the events that take place in The Iron Hunt, but it's well worth it. Hunter Kiss is beautifully written and has one of my favorite opening lines of all time. In addition, the anthology contains a handful of other good stories worth reading (Maggie Shayne, Meljean Brook, Alyssa Day).Having fallen in love with Maxine and her love interest, Grant, in Hunter Kiss, I'd been waiting a long time to read The Iron Hunt. Expectations were high. Pedestals were built. The book is excellent.Maxine has a rich and mysterious legacy, one that Marjorie reveals to us in a slow, sensuous striptease of a story. By the end of the book, many questions have been answered, but many more have been raised. I was definitely left hungering for more, but the story is dense enough that I feel like I've got something to hold me over. Scenes, lines of dialogue, characters keep flaring back to life in my mind, keeping me sated (at least for a while longer!). The prose is just as beautifully written as fans of her paranormal romances are used to but this story has an edge to it that her romances don't -- a dark, lonely core that I loved.
