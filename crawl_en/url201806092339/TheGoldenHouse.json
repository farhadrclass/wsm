(There, how\u2019s that for an elevator pitch?) This novel is full of nostalgic references, ornate erudite descriptions and high-brow prose, as you would expect from the man who brought us Midnight\u2019s Children and holds an esteemed Booker Prize. I, myself, was first introduced to Salman Rushdie by Hanif Kureishi, who wrote one of my favorite college reads, \nThe Black Album\n, in response to the fatwah issued by Islamic fundamentalists intent on killing Rushdie for writing his 4th novel, The Satanic Verses. So, you can imagine the anticipation I felt to finally meet this great novelist and essayist up close and in person for myself\u2014or as up close and in person as one\u2019s words on a page will allow us to get to the true author themselves.And here you have it. Sit back and imagine this:The Golden House trots along the Obama era years, from his inauguration on January 20, 2009, up to the election that gave us our 45th president. This political period is the mirror against which these characters see their lives unfolding, crumbling and transforming. Nero Golden and his household of three sons, of which he is the godlike patriarch, are expatriates of an unnamed country (which is eventually named) after a terrorist tragedy takes the life of their matriarch and shady financial deals finish them off in their homeland, sending the family to New York to rebuild their lives with the help of their obscene and conspicuous wealth by way of the American Dream. They move into a mega-mansion in an affluent neighborhood in Manhattan, where all 22 homes of the community back into a luxurious garden oasis that the families all collectively enjoy. It is in this near-utopian communal setting where lives begin to cross and our narrator, Ren\u00e9, is met by the leading family. We follow him on his journey to infiltrate, observe and ultimately document the Golden lives in a film he\u2019s been longing to make but isn\u2019t really sure of how to go about doing. Along the way, characters come and go. As the modern-day \u201cJulio-Claudian\u201d drama unfolds, death occurs. Birth occurs. Marriage occurs. The saga of their lives unfolds, shatters, melts down and repairs\u2014never in that order.If you\u2019re looking for a single word to describe this novel, a good starting place would be \ndense\n though I cannot argue that it is unnecessarily so, and the read certainly wouldn\u2019t have been the same without this aspect. Literary allusions\u2014call me Ishmael\u2014 abound on every page here and, quite honestly, you might want to have a digital encyclopedia on hand for quick reference through some of these passages\u2014 Chinese hexagrams of divination, for example? But I loved that, reveled in it for the most part, in fact, because this enlightened display of narrative talent played with so many forms of storytelling, from conventional narrative formatting to scenes written as screenplays, from the use of quotations marks to the use of not-a-one, and back again. It was a journey, but at least it was a ride too, crossing the lines of contemporary fiction, postmodernism and metafiction. Here you\u2019ll find wry social commentary that crackles and pops with dry irony, heaped on in healthy doses so that no culture\u2014past or present, Eastern or Western\u2014is safe from the scrutinizing eye\u2014though, with the backdrop of this novel being set specifically against the Obama era, much of the commentary hits hard on American culture, smashing up against it forcefully and knocking down our perception of it, knocking down the barriers around talking about it, from Black Lives Matter to the collapse of the housing market to transgender transformation and everywhere in between:\"Once upon a time\u2026if a boy liked pink and dolls his parents would be afraid he was homosexual and try to interest him in boy stuff\u2026they might have doubts about his orientation but it wouldn\u2019t occur to them to question his gender. Now it seems you go to the other extreme. Instead of saying the kid\u2019s a pansy you start trying to persuade him he\u2019s a girl.\"\u201cWhat is American culture?\u201d This novel dares to seriously ask\u2014often pokes fun at\u2014and ultimately explores\u2014no, turns inside out\u2014this beloved clich\u00e9 we and the world over cling to called the American Dream, from the viewpoint of the transplant, from the viewpoint of those ultimately in search of themselves in the whirlwind that is our lives in our culture today. \u201c\u2026I could feel it, the anger of the unjustly dead, the young men shot for walking in a stairwell while black, the young child shot for playing with a plastic gun in a playground while black, all the daily black death of America, screaming out that they deserved to live, and I could feel, too, the fury of white America at having to put up with a black man in a white house, and the frothing hatred of the homophobes\u2026the blue-collar anger of everyone who had been Fannie Mae\u2019d and Freddie Mac\u2019d by the housing calamity, all the discontent of a furiously divided country, everyone believing they were right\u2026\u201dRushdie\u2019s insightful narrative is at times chilling it its acute accuracy about our cultural climate and our 45th president\u2014\u201c\u2026the Joker shrieked\u2026in that bubble\u2026gun murderers were exercising their constitutional rights but the parents of murdered children were un-American\u2026mass deportations would be a good thing; and women reporters would be seen to be unreliable because they had blood coming out of their whatevers\u2026\"\u2014 and made The Golden House a complete package, which managed to be both entertaining and at times mildly surreal, with the help of a wink toward a more avant-garde formatting technique and a nod toward the \u201cmagically real.\u201dI navigated this novel with the sense of one at their grandfather\u2019s knee, he with brandy and cigar in hand, hearing a tale that was often fascinating in its baroqueness. The Golden House is chocked full of so many things we love in reads\u2014solid plotting, whimsy and intellectual stimuli\u2014which made the ornate density of this novel worth persevering through in the end\u2014and that both stirred and excited my reader soul, like a hearty helping of literary gumbo you have to close your eyes and smile to enjoy, adding depth to the layers of the pages, of these words.

It begins 20 January 2009, with Barack Obama\u2019s inauguration as the 44th President of the United States, setting the stage by reminding us of the economic ruin following the mortgage crisis that President Obama inherited. On the same day, Nero Golden, his three sons, Petronius, or Petya, Lucius Apuleius, or Apu and Dionysius, or D, arrive in the US from an unnamed country of origin, moving into a new abode in the \u201cGardens,\u201d an exclusive area of Greenwich Village where all of the 22 houses are linked connected by their garden hidden away from the city. Petya, 40, an agoraphobic, and an alcoholic, and Apu, 41, an attention-seeking artist, were born slightly less than one year apart, they share the same mother, and even the same zodiac sign. Dionysius has no recollection of his mother, and is still a relatively young 22. Eventually, Nero Golden, in his early 70s, brings into their new home a new wife, Vasilisa, a Russian expatriate.Their neighbor, Ren\u00e9, who loves the gardens, all things of beauty, is drawn to the Goldens; in them he sees a story that needs to be told. His passion is filmmaking; he sees himself as the artist painting their murky lives as he sees them, so that others will see them clearly, as well. \u201dHe leaned forward when standing or walking, as if struggling constantly against a strong wind only he could feel, bent a little from the waist, but not too much. This was a powerful man; no, more than that\u2014a man deeply in love with the idea of himself as powerful.\u201dRelatively early on in this novel, the era of Obama at the helm draw to a close, and the elections for the 45th President are on everyone\u2019s minds, including the media. \u201dHe was dangling his wickedness under our noses, reveling in it, challenging us to see it, contemptuous of our powers of comprehension, convinced of his ability easily to defeat anyone who rose against him.\u201dRushdie\u2019s observations from our past political election are quite accurate, if perhaps coloured by his personal vision. His many thoughts, regarding this man who would become President, with his \u201ccolored hair\u201d and bearing, leaving no doubt of his opinions on this topic. \u201dSometimes, watching him, I thought of Dr. Frankenstein\u2019s monster, a simulacrum of the human that entirely failed to express any true humanity.\u201dI would not describe reading this as a challenge, but rather a story you can\u2019t really allow your attention to wander, or get sidetracked. Every sentence seems to carry more importance than most contemporary fiction, and Rushdie isn\u2019t an author who injects wide spaces, long pauses between thoughts, so this book feels more extensive than most, but I thoroughly enjoyed it.

Overblown, bombastic in parts, melodramatic most of the way through, mind-numbingly boring in others, pinged with moments of social satire and brilliance.I'm such a rule follower. I received the ARC of this book from Netgalley and felt a duty to finish this book and write this review, hence, I finished this book, to its very last page. If I were more free spirited, like many of my brilliant, book-abandoning, life-is-too-short friends, I would not have slogged my way through the first THIRD of this book, in which nothing actually happens, and the very annoying narrator continually alludes to things happening in the future in a very overwrought and unnecessarily mysterious fashion.The story revolves around the Golden family, three sons lead by their criminal father, who, because of his criminal associations, leave their country of origin and reinvent themselves in Manhattan. They all take very poncey new names, and are ultimately punished for this disingenuous reinvention.The narrator is a neighbour who somehow inveigles into the family. He's a wannabe filmmaker, and thus his narrative is positively peppered with pop culture references (movies, books, and the like) to the point where my throat burned with the over-spiciness of it all. Instead of being enjoyable, it felt overdone and try-hard and exhausting to read.The rise and fall of this family is elevated to ridiculous levels of importance. But, where Rushdie really got my attention is when he began making timely connections between the state of the nation (during the time leading up to the current U.S. presidential election) and the state of the Golden house, writing some incredible, damning passages that leave no ambiguity to his feelings towards the 45th president. These passages are powerful, stunning and show a fiery mastery of political/social commentary.In that bubble, razor-tipped playing cards were funny, and lapel flowers that sprayed acid into people's faces were funny, and wishing you could have sex with your daughter was funny, and sarcasm was funny even when what was called sarcasm was not sarcastic, and lying was funny, and hatred was funny, and bigotry was funny, and bullying was funny, and the date was, or almost was, or might soon be, if the jokes worked out as they should, nineteen eighty-four.The parallels between Golden and the current president (referred to as the Joker) are unmistakable, even Golden's somewhat entertaining Melania-like second wife. However, I found it rambling, overwritten and heavy handed. Not terribly compelling for me, as a novel.

Not only do you put me in mind of a wise apothecarist straight from a Scheherezade tale, but for three decades I\u2019ve solidly sung your praises. And your Booker-winning epic, Midnight\u2019s Children is the one novel I\u2019d take with me if I were banished to a desert island. I sincerely hope that this punishment isn\u2019t meted out, Mr Rushdie, but I can assure you that the aforementioned book would be the exact one that I\u2019d take. (Why am I talking to him? Is he even reading this?) And yet, despite my enduring faith in the mastery of your storytelling, you\u2019ve dulled the shine of my veneration by writing Two Years, Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights, and now this! *Another sigh*Less of a structured novel and more a rambling stream of Rushdie\u2019s consciousness, this amorphous soliloquy is rammed to the rafters with a farrago of all that ails and delights one of our greatest living authors about our modern world. Nero Golden, a mysterious tycoon with a sketchy past, voluntarily exiles his family from Bombay/Mumbai and moves to a voluminous mansion in affluent Manhattan. Nero has aged like a fine wine; he\u2019s as perspicacious as he is formidable and speaks several languages. His story is told by a neighbour, Ren\u00e9 Underlinden, an amateur filmmaker who makes a mockumentary of the Golden family's expat life in Obama\u2019s America.Now I was told, from an early age, that one should never discuss politics or religion; but Salman clearly didn\u2019t listen to his mum, because he attacks these social taboos with an unashamed gusto, mischievously drawing parallels between bible belt bigots and Muslim extremists. And yes, despite being one of our most eminent writers, he\u2019s as fond of a stereotype as an Irishman is fond of a Guinness! ; )And, if you\u2019re a Trump supporter (as half of America appear to be), please, please don\u2019t read this book. Rushdie really has it in for the man (Donald is likened to The Joker, Hillary is portrayed as Batgirl). He is of course free to write whatever he wants but, regardless of my own feelings towards America\u2019s forty-fifth president, I\u2019m not convinced that the immersive otherworld of a fictional novel is really the appropriate place to air such views. Anyway, back to the story. Nero\u2019s cosy new life in his adoptive home is turned on its head by Vasila Arsenyeva, a long-limbed, gold-digging Siberian bombshell, who is as silent and as haughty as a cat and whose inner self has been consumed (quite literally) by Baba Yoga, the child-eating witch. There ensues an allegorical tale warning of the pitfalls that await each of the world\u2019s most powerful narcissists - Nero\u2019s predictive name of course giving us something of a clue as to his destiny.I must confess that getting through this novel was a war of attrition at times, but I'm still not giving up on one of my very favourite authors; the great man\u2019s authorial impishness and his artifice can still be seen glowing in the embers of his writing. Sir Salman, mate, it\u2019s not too late for you to rise again from the ashes. Come on over to my place for a t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate. We share an interest in magical realism, Marvel comics, arthouse movies and dwatted wabbits. We could fix this slump in form over a nice pot of tea - perhaps even a naked wrestle in front of a roaring fire (like Alan Bates and Oliver Reed in Women in Love), if that\u2019s more to your liking?On reflection, we\u2019d best stick with the tea.3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Seemita", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34622220-seemita", "userReview": "[Originally appeared here: http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/li...]The world has turned into a cacophony of unrelenting voices, where people in high offices as well as pedestrian consorts battle every day to be one up. The lines have blurred as issues have bulldozed their way, against most conventions, right into our living rooms, and administrative, as well as clandestine, powers are clashing regularly, and vehemently, across continents over the fatal flames of terrorism, corruption, religion and human rights. Bringing together these critical elements under a sprawling tale of love, ambition, deception and collapse is what \u2018The Golden House\u2019 is all about.On one silent day, when Nero Golden, the enigmatic, octogenarian patriarch of a family of four, tip-toes into a lavish mansion in downtown Manhattan, the neighbours\u2019 antennae go up without exception. Nothing is known about the family \u2013 its past, its roots, its business, its relations. Nero\u2019s three sons, Petya, Apu and D wander under equally mysterious pseudonyms and their circle remains sanctified of any unfamiliar trouble. Filthy rich and unusually secretive, they, at once, catch the fancy of their 20-something neighbour, Ren\u00e9, an aspiring filmmaker whose search for a subject to feed his magnum opus had, till then, been elusive. The fa\u00e7ade might have worked well had not a Russian missile come surreptitiously and hit the Goldens with scorching heat one evening \u2013 the ravishing Vasilisa. The tremors she sends across the bricks of the Golden House impales the garbs of its inhabitants and in their vulnerable faces, we gradually see, a lot of us.Chronicling the USA of Obama and Trump, Sir Rushdie writes with his trademark erudition and flamboyance, taking digs at the political mayhem the American soil has gotten embroiled into. From outright flimsy reasons triggering furore, to the politically-driven human rights issues, and to even likening the current Presidential rule to the Orwellian 1984 world, he spins the febrile web of the socio-political fabric of America with surgical precision.\nSpring, the last of the ice gone from the Hudson, and happy sails breaking out across the weekend water. Drought in California, Oscars for Birdman, but no superheroes available in Gotham. The Joker was on TV, announcing a run for president, along with the rest of the Suicide Squad. There was still more than a year and a half of the current president\u2019s term to run but I was missing him already and nostalgic for the present.\nCloser home, he doesn\u2019t spare the vandals of now-inevitable secularistic dissent and terrorist attacks. 26/11 Mumbai is invoked, and so is the abhorrent slavery to corruption, and the mastery of Sir Rushdie lies in bringing these two worlds, that of America and India, so tantalizingly close, and to a common ground of the bizarrely chaotic. While oscillating between the cinematic advent of Marvel Comics binge and the 1993 Mumbai blasts, Gamergate and beef ban, one recognizes this work to be a dazzling collage of double zeitgeist, not to be missed.On the humane and moralistic aspects, Sir Rushdie\u2019s prose swells like air and fills the narrative space with believable characters that are strong yet flawed. I found the Golden brothers to bear uncanny resemblance to the three brothers in Dostoevsky\u2019s The Brothers Karamazov; why, even the eldest one is named Petya! Well, the genteel characterization of their strengths and fears, their shrewdness and vulnerability, points towards a place where they reflect the society we live in and in some way, become our kin. One might be tempted to give a bear hug to D who grapples under an identity crisis, or an evening to Petya whose agoraphobia warrants a walk in the nearby Gardens, or a lift to Apu whose demons come to haunt him. Whether it is the fight to keep the Ren\u00e9 -Suchitra relationship alive or the urge to stall the arrival of Alzheimer into Nero\u2019s life, under the pitch-dark skies of seduction and treachery, lies and loss, the reader shall encounter redeeming sunshine of gender acceptance, infallible love, filial loyalty and intellectual futility.\nThe river of his thought was no longer clear, its water an opaque and muddied flow, and within it his consciousness was slowly losing its grip on chronology, on what was then, what now, what was waking truth and what had been born in the fairyland of dreams. The library of time was disordered, its categories jumbled, its indexes scrambled or destroyed.\nMaking our narrator, Ren\u00e9, a filmmaker, turns out to be a very smart move. Apart from sprinkling generous movie recommendations like Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff\u2019s \u2018Swann in Love\u2019 , Robert Wiene\u2019s 'The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\u2019 and Satyajit Ray\u2019s \u2018Pather Panchali\u2019, the narrator\u2019s profession facilitates to keep the viewfinder largely unrestricted despite the limitation of a first-person account. His role provides the book\u2019s structure, a legitimate trail of imagination wherein he can relay a scene which he wasn\u2019t privy to and yet, pass it with the stamp of veracity.Can a person be both good and evil? The Golden House is a towering novel, carrying sagacious meditation on human emotions and desires, and weaving their many threads into weapons that slither too close, issuing a resounding warning on the incredible proximity we have with one another and reminding us that no place, no matter how far and conducive, can absolve us of our past.

Now \u2013 no longer plain old Rushdie but an ennobled Sir Salman \u2013 he has Donald J. Trump in his sights, reimagined in The Golden House as \u2018the Joker\u2019, come to exploit an America stupid from superhero movies.The origins of the Joker were disputed, the man himself seemed to enjoy allowing contradictory versions to fight for air space, but on one fact everyone, passionate supporters and bitter antagonists, was agreed: he was utterly and certifiably insane. What was astonishing, what made this an election year like no other, was that people backed him because he was insane, not in spite of it. What would have disqualified any other candidate made him his followers' hero. Sikh taxi drivers and rodeo cowboys, rabid alt-right blondes and black brain surgeons agreed, we love his craziness, no milquetoast euphemisms from him, he shoots straight from the hip, says whatever he fucking wants to say, robs whatever bank he's in the mood to rob, kills whoever he feels like killing, he's our guy.The Joker is a background presence in this book and only gets talked about in the final third; the main focus is on the immigrant vulgarian Nero Golden, who is himself a Trumpian analogue, with the same speech patterns, putative wealth, and need to put his name \u2018on everything from hot dogs to for-profit universities\u2019. The growth of Nero's empire in the US, and its effect on his three sons, forms the narrative arc of the novel, as observed by our narrator, the Belgian-American filmmaker Ren\u00e9.Several problems. The main one is that the story is not especially engaging: for the most part we just plod along, hearing little snippets of soap-opera gossip from each son in turn, related to us in a strangely distant, elegiac tone that strips away any immediacy from the prose. One longs for a hint of that exuberance that marked Rushdie's writing in the 80s and early 90s. Narrator Ren\u00e9 compares himself to Isherwood at some point \u2013 \u2018I am a camera\u2019 \u2013 and comments, \u2018Maybe I'm a smart camera. I record, but I'm not exactly passive.\u2019 But despite his involvement in the plot, he is passive, and I didn't care about a single person he described. The writing is terribly pedestrian for someone who has written the kind of things Rushdie has written. While Indira Gandhi's India and Thatcher's Britain were explored from within, experientially, Trump's America is simply pointed at, like a news report, and said to be awful.Along the way there are some game efforts to examine the key concerns of twenty-first-century America \u2013 the youngest Golden son, for instance, feels uncomfortable as a man and is encouraged to transition to a different gender. I thought at first that this might be an interesting exploration, building on a fleeting reference to India's hijra tradition, but the results are disappointing: he meets a sticky end and his social-justice girlfriend comes to the conclusion that identity politics are all a big mistake after all. I am not unsympathetic to that view, but here it just felt a lot more like the thoughts of a seventy-year-old author than a twentysomething arts curator. Ian McEwan also touched on this subject in Nutshell, but the difference is that McEwan's prose was pure fireworks.Occasionally there are outright blunders. This could have come from Dan Brown:In the game of chess the move known as the Queen's Gambit is almost never used because it gives up the most powerful piece on the board for the sake of a risky positional advantage. Only the true grandmasters would attempt so daring a maneuver [\u2026] the laying down of the queen to kill the king.The queen's gambit involves putting a pawn on the fourth rank during the opening, and has nothing to do with sacrificing the queen as a piece.To be sure, when Rushdie is talking about things that I think he cares about \u2013 primarily the 2016 US election and the 2008 Mumbai attacks \u2013 the energy picks up a bit, the sentences become more breathless and pacy, and you start to take notice. I loved, for example, his heartfelt reflection of how people coped with the dazed sense of reality after Trump was elected:How does one live amongst one's fellow countrymen and countrywomen when you don't know which of them is numbered amongst the sixty-million-plus who brought the horror to power, when you can't tell who should be counted among the ninety-million-plus who shrugged and stayed home, or when your fellow Americans tell you that knowing things is \u00e9litist and they hate \u00e9lites, and all you have ever had is your mind and you were brought up to believe in the loveliness of knowledge, not that knowledge-is-power nonsense but knowledge is beauty, and then all of that, education, art, music, film, becomes a reason for being loathed, and the creature out of Spiritus Mundi rises up and slouches toward Washington, D.C., to be born.Perhaps it is worth reading the book for the paragraphs like this that crop up in its final sections. But I wish he had just written an article about Trump, and not tried to buttress it up with all the architecture of a novel, filled with characters I never had much interest in. (Nor, I suspect, did he.) In the future, I think it may be interesting to look back on The Golden House as an example of how great writers reacted to Trump's win as it was happening, but perhaps there isn't enough distance yet to really treat the subject with the full artistic arsenal that it demands. In this case, it's more of a gilded failure than the twenty-four-carat success I was crossing my fingers for."}, {"userName": "Mackey St", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28470777-mackey-st", "userReview": "Once upon a time a great man fled from his native country, a land embattled by infighting and death, and came to a country filled with dreams of a future of hope and promise. Ah, yes, an apt description of Salman Rushdie and his primary character in The Golden House, Nero Golden. As I read through this verbose tale of the egotistical Golden, I realized that this was, in fact, a veiled auto-biography of Rushdie, intended or otherwise, most likely not. In The Golden House, Nero Golden has immigrated to the US under secret circumstances with his adult children all of whom have assumed Roman names: Petronius, or Petya; Lucius Apuleius, or Apu, and Dionysius, or D. The family lives in downtown Manhattan in a gated community. The story is narrated by Rene', a neighbor and aspiring film maker who wants to make documentary about this mysterious family. It takes nearly 200 pages for the reader to gather this information. Additionally, midway through the book the characters become involved in the contentious election of 2016, about which Rushdie makes his opinions very clear - the winner being The Joker. Seriously. He has green hair. I truly understand metaphorical writing. I appreciate humor and certainly enjoy social commentary. However, I never fully understood into which of these The Golden House fell. There was so much verbage, so many ideas, too many great quotes, but they never were tied together cohesively. If Midnight's Children was Rushdie in his brilliance; this was Rushdie in full shade, with the curtains drawn and all of his hidden thoughts allowed to run amuck. Reading it was like watching a three ring circus without knowing where to look. Do you follow Nero and his sons? Rene' and his ramblings? The Joker and the election? Look here, look at me, but you couldn't follow all three because they only were held together by a gossamer filament.Rushdie attempts, always, to enlighten his readers with social themes, political nuance, global issues. With The Golden House, however, his own personal discord and past have left us with a muddled mess. If you have not read this author before, please do so but begin with his earlier works. Thank you to Netgalley and Random House for my copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "This is a book of stories and identity; actual, created, and retold as tales to others. It questions what we think about as truth, especially when it comes to ourselves and others; what is said, hidden, implied, or lied about? Can we ever really know ourselves when we are so immersed and intertwined with other peoples' stories, with what they believe about us or want us to be? In this vortex of truth and lies, is one really more valid than the other?From the outset it reminded me somewhat of The Virgin Suicides, enshrouded in a specific time, that of vivid modernity, but equally universal in the ways of human behaviour, shadowed by that overwhelming feeling of impeding doom. In case anyone thinks i'm giving something away, please see the choice of Roman/Greek names for the main characters. Rushdie might as well have been shouting  this is not going to end well. The family treads the same path of decline as the America it inhabits, from the hope of the Obama era to the what Rushdie envisions as the Joker presidency. It could have been called The Fall of the Golden House. Or perhaps that's sufficiently implied. The Goldens all told stories about themselves, stories in which essential information about origins was either omitted or falsified. I listened to them not as 'true' but as indications of character.Of course, the reader only 'knows' this Golden family through the eyes of outsider, film director, and neighbour, Rene, whose current project is to make a film telling their story. The question never far from the mind is how much of what we are being told is real? Is it the truth as the Golden's would understand it? Far from reflecting the impartial gaze of the camera, Rene's perceptions determine the narrative, especially as his associations with the family become closer and more complex. This is reflected in the structure of the writing, sometimes set up as a film script, with directions and asides from the narrator. It is not steady narrative, it jumps from the 'we' of the collective habitants of 'The Gardens' surrounding Golden House, to the 'I' of Rene, to internal monologues he could only be imagining, reported speech, and even interjections from mythical characters of folklore, like witch Baba Yaga. These layered stories, interspersed with frequent literary, cultural, and film quotation and reference, combine to form a labyrinth of connected lives and ideas, revealing how we use others' stories to illuminate our own, sometimes guiding or bolstering our identity, or even overwhelming who we are or who we might be. In the end, when it comes to people, truth and reality may be nothing more our own creations.  I'm also finally finishing up my Golden screenplay, my faction about these men who made fictions of themselves, and the two are blurring into each other until i'm not sure anymore what's real and what I made up.I can see how others might find this too self-referential, too obviously clever, but it's nevertheless my favourite since Midnight's Children. As a commentary on modern society and contemporary ideas of truth and identity, it's not to be missed.ARC via Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "This is a masterful literary achievement and a great lens on contemporary American culture from the perspective of an unusual immigrant family. The Goldens\u2014an old man named Nero and his three adult sons-- arrive in Manhattan around 2008 and take up residence in a mansion that shares a common garden park with a small neighborhood of wealthy residents. Our narrator, who calls himself Rene, is an aspiring film maker in his twenties who is still living with his parents in the same neighborhood and who becomes obsessed with the mystery and allure of the Goldens. Their story is that they simply chose to leave their life in unnamed country to create a new life in America. By ingratiating himself with the family, Rene soon learns small pieces of their hidden story, in particular that they are escaping from some disaster that included a tragic death of Nero\u2019s wife and that Nero had some connection with gangsters. Whatever unknown crimes are waiting for him to uncover, Rene is captivated by Nero\u2019s overall modus operandi: \u2026he was, they all were, in the grip of a huge fantasy: the idea that men would not be judged by who they once were and what they had once done, if only they decided to be different.Rene\u2019s compulsion to figure out what makes the Golden\u2019s tick becomes linked to his ambition to make a great movie based on their lives. A movie with parallels to \u201cRear Window\u201d or \u201cThe Great Gatsby.\u201d As he slowly becomes effectively a member of their family, he learns their secrets piece by piece. The mythic overtones are already there in their adoption of names in their new country\u2014e.g. Nero for the tyrannical Roman emperor and one son with the name of the god Dionysus. The oldest son, Petronius (aka Peyra), is brilliant in mathematics and writing computer games but is socially clumsy and suffers from agoraphobia and an Asperger-like condition. The second son, Lucius Apuleius (Apu for short), is a \u201cgluttonous agoraphile\u201d who sought out the varieties of life in the city \u201clike a young Whtiman\u201d, became an avante garde artist, and \u201ccame to be thought of as a magic creature, an escapee from a fairy tale, though nobody could say if he was charmed or doomed\u201d. While these two were over 40, Dionysus, who goes by \u201cD\u201d, is 20 years younger, a sensitive man who turns out to have gender identity issues. He loves a woman who runs the \u201cMuseum of Identity\u201d and who pressures him to make the transgender metamorphosis, a jump he balks at and leads him to much anguish. A final key character is an elegant Russian woman of 28, Vasilisa, who picks Nero as her husband and Tsar of money and power. Rene is writing from some point in the future, which is the reader\u2019s contemporary time at the end of 2016. He warns us that he is an unreliable narrator:Maybe I am a smart camera. I record, but I\u2019m not exactly passive. I think, I alter. Possibly I even invent. To be an imaginer, after all is very different from being a literalist.Prospective readers might consider this set-up and become wary over whether this book is for them. Like me, maybe they doubt whether the lives of the powerful and wealthy would be compelling. Maybe through \u201cThe Sopranos\u201d and \u201cThe Godfather\u201d you believe you have had your fill of exploring the human side of those who struggle to live with their ill-gotten gains. But this is something different. It feels like a true portrait of America as a field of dreams and tragic disappointments, spanning the interval between the election of Obama and that of Trump. As the plot unfolds and Rene crosses the line from observer to a serious participant in the drama and unfolding tragedies in the Golden\u2019s lives, we are embedded a lot of substantive moral choices about how we should live our lives. While being taxed to judge and figure out the characters before me on Rene\u2019s stage, I was delightfully dizzied by all the help proffered from the wise men of history and truth wizards of our current time. Allusions abound in every paragraph\u2014from movies and literature to songs and slogans from popular culture. Instead of cryptic references or obscure allegory that you can encounter with a Nabokov or Joyce, most of such stretches of context and framing are clear and bound well into the lively dialogue and situations of the characters. You may only have a dim conception of, say, the Greek plays of Aristophanes or the movies of Luis Bunuel, but a deftly explained and relevant reference to them is satisfactorily uplifting and edifying for me. It begins to sink in that the issues of lofty figures from Homer or Shakespeare have their counterpart in the lives of the novel\u2019s characters and, in turn, the average reader.The tone the narrator takes wavers between the casually intimate to mock epic in scope. I loved that variety. With a simple word or phrase\u2014\u201cCut\u201d, \u201cFade to black\u201d\u2014Rene\u2019s narration puts a smile on my face as a collaborating camera man. I appreciated Rene\u2019s stated ambition of transmuting the lives of \u201creal\u201d characters into film tropes as the reverse of Woody Allen\u2019s play on film characters breaking out into real life in his \u201cPurple Rose of Cairo\u201d. Despite this kind of romping, Rushie claimed in a recent PBS interview that his goal with the book was to convey to his readers a vision of \u201chow things really are\u201d and, hopefully, in the course of time to be able to evoke the reaction that \u201cthis is how things really were.\u201d In the background of the story, Trump as a nameless candidate appears as a green-haired Joker of comic book fame. No magical realism here. During this period Rene makes money helping his lover create satirical political advertising for the other candidate, who is portrayed as Batwoman in various scenarios. Rushie emphasizes the critical need at this time for laugher, noting that he has Trump figure \u201ccackling at the edges of the story.\u201d I think for many of us the collision of reality and unreality is well summed up in Rene\u2019s internal pondering here:How does one live amongst one\u2019s fellow countrymen and countrywomen when you don\u2019t know which of them is numbered against the sixty-million plus who brought the horror to power, when you can\u2019t tell who should be counted among the ninety-million plus who shrugged and stayed home, or when your fellow Americans tell you that knowing things is elitist and that they hate all elites, \u2026and then all of that, education, art, music, film, becomes a reason for being loathed, and the creature out of Spiritus Mundi rises up and slouches toward Washington, D.C., to be born.The story Rene wants to forge into a movie is ultimately his own story. The novel asks if his character will develop past his challenges and barriers using lessons he can learn from the Goldens. His filmmaker lover lays out this scope of Rushie\u2019s novel:\u201cYou realize\u201d, Suchitra said, \u201cthat this has become a movie about you, and all these Golden boys are aspects of your own nature. \u2026All the characters are the auteur. It\u2019s like Flaubert, Madame Bovary, c\u2019est moi.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not an artist\u201d, I said, \u201cnot sexually conflicted, not autistic, not a Russian gold digger, not a powerful old man in decline.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re carrying their questions with you wherever you go. The question of Apu\u2019s life\u2026Is it necessary to be profound or can you remain permanently on the surface? You need to answer this question also. D Golden, as his father also said, was all about ambiguity and pain. I feel it in you also, some ambiguity. I feel that you are in pain. As for Petya, he\u2019s hemmed in by himself, he can\u2019t escape his nature, though he much wants to be free. And maybe his games, the games he invents, are his freedom. That\u2019s the place where he isn\u2019t afraid. Maybe that\u2019s the place you need to find. \u2026And the old man \u2026He is enfolded in tragedy, and so are you. He has lost sons, you lost parents. Your grief defines you and shuts you off from other people.\u2026I just see who you can be and I want you to see it too. Be profound. Own your tragedy. Find your freedom. Resolve your ambiguity, whatever it is.\u201dThroughout the book we are asked to consider whether a person can be both good and evil. Rene has to expand that debate over each of the Goldens to his own person. At one point he reaches the following dark state:\u2026I learned the final lesson, the learning of which separates us from innocence. That there was no safe space, that the monster was always at the gates, and a little of the monster was within us too, we were monsters we had always feared, and no matter what beauty enfolded us, no matter how lucky we were in life or money or family or talent or love, at the end of the road the fire was burning, and it would consume us all.Pretty ponderous and portentious, right? But we want to love and trust this Rene. Maybe we find some way to proceed in a Trump world with the following lesson:The antic clothing of the absurd, the idea of the meaninglessness of life, was a more attractive philosophical garment to many of us than the tragedian\u2019s somber robes, which, when worn, became both the evidence and the agents of doom. But it was also an aspect of human nature\u2014just as powerful a characteristic of the contradictory human animal as its opposite\u2014fatalistically to accept that there was indeed a natural order of things, and uncomplainingly to play the cards you were dealt.Overall, I was richly rewarded by this read. I was thrilled by it lively pace and well pleased with the balance between playful satire and serious drama. One of my best reading experiences of the year.

Rushdie uses the unsettled American political landscape \u2013 this novel begins with the inauguration of Barack Obama and ends with the rise of \u2018the Joker,\u2019 a (very) thinly veiled portrait of Trump \u2013 to great effect. He ties in the eight years of the 44th President to the \u2018reign\u2019 of Nero Golden, a seventy-something man, who arrives from an unknown location and moves into the \u2018Golden House\u2019 of the title; the place formerly known as the \u2018Murray Mansion,\u2019 before the occupants changed hands. The house, the grandest in the community, helps form a wealthy enclave in New York, with all of the rear yards of the properties crating an enclosed, communal garden, which is much loved by the residents.One such resident is our narrator, Rene, who lives with his parents in one of the houses, and soon becomes obsessed with Nero Golden and his three sons; Petya, Apu and Dionysus (or simply \u2018D\u2019). Nero Golden has re-named his sons and carefully guards their family history and secrets. With speculation amongst his neighbours rife, gradually Rene befriends the residents of the Golden House, learns their secrets, watches their rise \u2013 and spectacular fall \u2013 and becomes involved in their lives, as they become linked with his. Rene longs to be a film-maker and his subjects are to be the residents of the Golden House. Life, of course, is not static, and the arrival of women in the Golden men\u2019s lives, changes the dynamics within the Golden House in many ways. Indeed, the family secrets, the intrigue, the relationships between the characters would undoubtedly make a block buster of a movie. Rushdie effortlessly weaves his characters, who take their names from myth and the ancient world, and combines this with the current political landscape, to create a riveting account of a young man\u2019s awakening and his confusing relationships with those around him.

SUMMARYBarack Obama has just been inaugurated the first time when a septuagenarian foreign billionaire and his three adult sons take up residence in New York\u2019s Greenwich Village. Nero Julius Golden arrives at his new home in a Daimler limousine, with his eldest son Petya, 44, who is agoraphobic and an alcoholic; Apu who is 41 and a romantic and flamboyant artist, and D who at 22 is the baby of the family and harbors a deeply held secret. But, that is only one of many secrets that this family holds. The biggest secret is why they have come to the United States, and changed their identities. While still in the limousine Nero tells his son to never tell anyone where they came from. Upon the Golden\u2019s arrival at their new home, the Murray mansion, the grandest of all the homes in the Macdougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District, we soon are introduced to the Golden\u2019s neighbor, and our narrator Ren\u00e9. Ren\u00e9 is an ambitious young filmmaker full of energy and ambition and enamored with the Golden\u2019s mystique. He ingratiates himself with the family in order to learn as much as he can, with the hope of finding out what brought them here and developing a movie about them. He not only tells the story but soon plays a part of the story, he inevitably become embroiled in the family\u2019s quarrels, romances, infidelities and their secrets. REVIEWTHE GOLDEN HOUSE is set against the backdrop of current American culture and politics. As the family assimilates to life in the US, events begin unfolding triggering disaster for the Golden family. The mystery of who this family were, where they immigrated from, and why, is a predominant part of the story. The character development for THE GOLDEN HOUSE was masterful. Nero and each of his sons image, personality, interests, strengths and weaknesses leap off the pages of this book. It's easy to become enthralled with each of their unique and perhaps, peculiar lives. And even Ren\u00e9, the knowledgable neighbor, and creative and passionate narrator proves to be a most endearing character. His integration with the family proves to be more than even he expected. The story of the of Golden family is intense, mysterious and complex. A variety of topics are included in this 368 page book: current politics, fidelity, sexual identity, autism, art culture, migration, honesty, and sins of the father. The complexity of the book is derived from Ren\u00e9\u2019s innumerable historical, literary, and film references, many of which I was not familiar with. While this was somewhat challenging, it did not diminish the enjoyment of THE GOLDEN HOUSE. Another imaginative part of the book was Ren\u00e9\u2019s telling of portions of the story as a scripted scene of how he would film it for his movie. Loved it! One of my favorite parts of the book was SALMAN RUSHDIE\u2019s adroit humor when describing the 2016 presidential election, in particularly the ingenious symbolic use of a certain comic book villain as the crass candidate in the election. Not that there was ever any doubt that RUSHIE admirably stood with Her.

I was a little 'ho hum' for the first 10% to 12% percent. Once introduced to the character Petya, the oldest son in 'The Golden Family', the storytelling kept soaring.I was immediately pulled in to the personality profiles of each of Nero Golden's three son's. Petya, is considered high on the autism spectrum. I was especially interested inthe behaviors of Petya because my husband and I had guest staying with us last week who either had austism or we suspected Asperger's. It was a challenge and experience for us last week. Our guest was in town for a virtual reality symposium. He was exactly the way Petya is described: extraordinary, vulnerable, gifted, and an incompetent human being. \"He was physically clumsy, and sometimes, when agitated, clumsy to the mouth, stammering and stuttering and being infuriated by his own ineptitude\". Petya prefer to stay indoors -just like our guest -perhaps borderline agoraphobic.If you asked Petya direct question he would answer honestly because his brain made it impossible for him to lie....\"Yet out of loyalty to his father's wishes he managed to find a way. He trained himself in locutions of avoidance, \"I will not answer that question\", or \"maybe you should ask someone else\". At age 42.... there were parts of Petya that would always remain a child. I was fascinated with Petya.....But....Then we meet his brother, one year younger in 'age'. Their birthdays are less than 12 months apart. Lucius Apuleius, a.k.a. Apu. is 41 -- a Gemini horsescope like his older brother Petya. Apu was unsympathetic to his older brothers issues. A very different type of person in every shape and form. He was a gifted painter - considered technically as great as Dali. Many of the New York ladies were happy to undress for him.... and soon after his first solo show he became a famous artist. \"America changed them both, Petya and Apu--America, that divided self--polarizing them as America was polarized, the wars of America, external and internal, becoming their wars as well; but in the beginning, if Petya arrived in New York as a heavy -drinking polymath who was afraid of the world and found living in it a constant hardship, then Apu came as the sober romantic artist and promiscuous metropolitan, flirting with everything that was visionary yet with a clarity of vision that allowed him to see people plain as his portraits showed\". The youngest son is named D. D is 22 years old... he feels like the odd one out child - has dealt with loneliness -feels like a misfit in his own skin. He's withholding a secret from his family. Rene is a young filmmaker - around mid 20's - young with energy and ambition. He weasels himself- very smoothly into the Golden family. He wants to make a film about their family. As a significant and subtle character - he never overshadows the turn of events - he guides them subtly. I really enjoyed this book. I felt nostalgic for those early days when we first learned Barack Obama became President. I remember the hope - the pride - the joy .....then the sadness which hit me as I read \"The Golden House\". I'm sure I didn't understand every single thing - Salman Rushdie is a challenging author to read ....but I was sincerely engaged. I laughed out loud many times. I was in 'aw' at Rushdie's brilliance other times. I ended with 'sitting'...... sitting in a chair for 20 minutes- alone - quiet .... eyes watering..... just 'thinking'. This is our world right now ---animated, theatrical- nutty - scary - confusing - with many people most comfortable isolating in their homes---while others are flamboyant outlandish socially active in the arts - sports -politics- and community. Love, fear, anger, hate... we live with it all. It's a sad beautiful world! Enduring storytelling!!! This is Rushdie's best book since \"Midnight Children\".

You never feel great when you are about to give a not-so-glowing review to a really well known, acclaimed writer's work.\n But the review's gotta be honest. So honest it will be. In fact, I've recently written a post about how to write a review for a book that you didn't like, when it happens to be famous. It wasn't inspired by The Golden House though!Maybe it was wrong to request an ARC by Salman Rushdie when I've never read his work before (although I have another book of his, so I will be giving him another chance), but I was also so excited, particularly because I've never read his books. Now I'm just wondering \u2013 was it this one, or is it just his style I don't really like..? \nAnyway, here's what the book is about:\nDespite most rich people being somewhat weird, the ones inhabiting The Golden House are even weirder. It's not that they've taken great care to hide where they've come from. The funniest thing about their secretiveness happens to be that they've given themselves complete Roman patrician names and pretty much believe themselves to be such. It's a complicated act which involved them believing it to become who they are. But our main character really wants to get to the bottom of it, and even make a movie about them. So he gets involved into their family tragedy, and probably a little deeper than he wanted to. And so the story rolls on...\nThe Golden House is crafted like a good, well-written classical tragedy\n \u2013 perhaps that's what I'd say if I knew my literary sciences. Which I don't, so I can just present a hunch that that's how it is. It kind of weaves together with their Roman \"roots\" and pretenses. \nHowever, I felt it extremely long winded.\n The biggest drawback for me in this book was its particular structure, which is more or less like this: 0-40%: main character introduces the entire neighbourhood and the Golden family. Nothing but epic foreshadowing is happening.\n 40-60%: enter some new characters. Drop some more hints. Nothing real is still going on.\n 60-80%: the book suddenly explodes with stuff going on and it finally engages me! This is where most of the tragedy happens. \n   80-100%: nothing... continues happening. There is a resolution, but it's very transparent and I feel like it didn't even need telling. \n  Basically? I felt like half the book was essentially about nothing. However, some positive facts have to be mentioned. The book deals with the questions of identity, of gender and sex, understanding who you are, can and want to be. I felt like it was well dealt with, as it distills the essence of why some of us can't understand that physical sex and gender are not the same (or rather, we only try to think of it as the same because of our culture and tradition, but it's not the only culture or tradition in history). I really liked these diversity talks \u2013 it also helped me understand the sometimes complicated logic of all of that stuff, the whys and hows, and answer some questions about it for myself. Apart from that, there's the genius comparison of the current state of political affairs to what we all understand so well \u2013 pop culture \u2013 by referring to it as \nThe United States of Joker.\n Where scalpel playing cards and lapel flowers squirting acid are fun. \nIsn't it genius?\n If anything, that's the one part the book is truly worth a read for!\nIn a nutshell? The Golden House is a modern history of a family's demise, almost in the classical tragedy tradition. \nHowever, it also seemed like a jumble of modern, interesting, smart ideas, but no reason to even have them there. \nMaybe I'm just not post-modern enough? Or literary enough?\n I always maintain that it's something \nI've missed\n, but I feel like \nThe Golden House\n could have taken 40% of the pages and still said just as much. Most of the time it kind of bored me, to be honest. I'll be happy to read other people's reviews to see what they managed to find in it! \nMy final verdict:\nI thank Random House and Salman Rushdie for providing a digital review copy through NetGalley in exchange to an honest review.

He keeps cropping up everywhere and I always meant to read Satanic Verses for the big hubbub it made back in the day. You know, the whole assassination thing. And yet, I never actually got a round to reading him.And then, out of the blue, I see a chance. Netgalley. I jumped on it and was pleasantly surprised to get it. And then I read my very first Rushdie.Expectations are a tricky thing. I rather thought I was going to get a heavy literary novel full of references and mythology bubbling beneath the circus, if not surface, of the text. What I got was exactly that, but more-so, because I was engrossed in something so very readable and enjoyable that I never once had to really WORK at it. You know? All the references myth were telegraphed as loudly as a classic Russian novel, the basic themes as loud as Bollywood musical, the pathos and the tragedy as distinctly American as a Mafia film. Indeed, my own references were carefully considered and a careful reader will know what to expect if they pick this novel up. :)It was pretty awesome, all told. The search and the apparent finding and confusion of identity is a very major theme, whether told as the story of Nero Golden, the patriarch, or through any of his sons who are as bright as those in Brothers Karamazov, or through the identity of our unreliable narrator, the house-guest and future filmmaker of the House of Golden.But let me be honest here... I'd have read and enjoyed this novel just for the sequences about the rise of the Joker in politics. :) That stuff was GOLDEN. And indeed, all of this was clever and fascinating and the looming tragedy of the family always kept me glued to the page as if I was rubbernecking a particularly bad auto accident. And it was beautiful. I don't know what that says about me, but I certainly love a good tragedy. It was lurid and fantastical and gaudy as if we were reading about Gatsby which, indeed, there was made multiple references.Above all, this is a very modern book full of modern post-truth America and the lies that we see with our right eyes and the distorted truths of our left. I can honestly recommend this as a great and fun read. All those accolades that Rushdie seems to be getting are well deserved. He's one hell of a writer."}, {"userName": "Lucy Banks", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57486568-lucy-banks", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book from Netgalley, in exchange for an honest review.The rise and fall of the Golden family, told through the 'post-truth' haze of US culture.With an enigmatic title like that, I had no idea what to expect from Salman Rushdie's latest book. The first few pages, I was still none the wiser - then bam, after twenty pages or so, I was involved - and when I say involved, I mean completely mesmerised.To briefly summarise the book (without giving too much away) - it follows a man who moves to the US under mysterious circumstances; a rich, bombastic man who goes by the name of Nero Golden. He arrives with his three sons, Petya (who is a sensitive, highly intelligent individual, on the autistic spectrum), Apu (a womanising artist) and D (the youngest, who is in search of his true identity). They're followed through the eyes of Rene (or is that even his name... I was never quite sure, and I loved the ambiguity of this somewhat unreliable narrator) - a film-maker who is determined to make a movie based on the Golden family's life. There's plenty to make a movie about. The sons have lovers, as captivating and intriguing as themselves. Nero ends up marrying a young Russian athlete / supermodel type, who also has the personality (quite literally) of a clever, ruthless witch. And soon, things start going badly wrong for the family - due largely to Nero's past misdeeds.I loved so many aspects of this story. The beautiful weaving of myth, legend and ancient history, against the stark, yet sparkling backdrop of America, with the rise of 'The Joker' in the forthcoming election. I loved the characters - because they were so rich, so nuanced, and so unutterably fascinating. And the pathos came through loud and clear - there's a distinctive tragic element here that's almost Shakespearean at times. Rene's frequent blurring of movie-plot and fact makes for an interesting read too - it seemed to be a reflection on today's post-truth culture... i.e. if we say a thing is true, then it is.

Rushdie literally killed his book. There is so much nonsense in the last part, a lot of pointless writing about trump and hillary clinton and the indian mafia. there is no magical story, there are really bad allegories and comparisions.

Sometimes I thought it was brilliant and other times I thought that it was tragically unsubtle. I also kept finding parts that I wanted to quote, because they were written so well and/or they described just how I felt. This was my first experience with this author, but I definitely want to read more by him now. The book covers so much territory including sons suffering from the sins of the father, identity fluidity and political commentary. It incorporates real events like terrorist attacks, a prison escape aided by a lovestruck prison employee and Trump's election (although using a different name for the clown-like, unqualified candidate).The story is told through the eyes of a young, would-be film maker who thinks that the wealthy Golden family would make a great subject for a film. Nero Julius Golden comes from India to live in an old mansion in Greenwich Village with his three adult sons during the Obama administration. \"[Nero] was majestic in all things, in his stiff-collared shirts, his cufflinks, his bespoke English shoes, his way of walking toward closed doors without slowing down, knowing they would open for him...and his often repeated dictum - one favored by absolute rulers from Caesar to Haile Selassie - that the only virtue worth caring about was loyalty.\" Each of the Goldens left his old identity behind and reinvented himself in America. Nero is later targeted by an expert Russian gold digger who has also reinvented herself and who comes prepared on their third date with a list of demands for cars, apartments and credit cards. The Goldens do very well in America until things begin to unravel for them (and for America). As part of his political commentary, the author added how he feels as an artist and intellectual after the Trump election. \"How does one live amongst one's fellow countrymen and countrywomen when you don't know which of them is numbered amongst the sixty million plus who brought the horror to power, when you can't tell who should be counted among the ninety million plus who shrugged and stayed home, or when your fellow Americans tell you that knowing things is elitist and they hate elites, and all you have ever had is your mind and you were brought up to believe in the loveliness of knowledge, not that knowledge-is-power nonsense but knowledge is beauty, and then all of that, education, art, music, film, becomes a reason for being loathed, and the creature of the Spiritus Mundi rises up and slouches toward Washington, DC to be born.\"I was interested in the tragic arc of the lives of the Goldens and I totally identified with the author's despair about the direction of America.

In a word, uneven. There are moments of brilliance and moments of tedium here. Peppered liberally (VERY liberally) with references to film, art, music, mythology and literature ranging from the ancient world to pop culture, The Golden House will be a feast for some readers, exhausting for others. For me, this book is at its best when at its most fanciful, incorporating myths and snippets from epic tales into the narrative. I also enjoyed Nero's nefarious backstory, when finally divulged, but it comes late in the novel and is by necessity, quite rushed. The story takes place from 2008 to 2016 and touches on (very briefly) some of the most topical issues and events of the decade, including:- Occupy Wall Street - Gender identity politics - Gamer gate These were and are issues of utmost concern to the people involved with them but Rushdie here presents them merely as curiosities recounted by a disinterested outsider. They become a bit lifeless, like he's describing specimens under glass rather than the living beast. With so much crammed in to one book I guess there just wasn't room to do justice to all of it. Then there's the 2016 U.S. Presidential campaign, which serves as not much more than colourful set dressing. This garish backdrop is far more interesting than the Gatsby-ish story playing out in the foreground. Passages of the book are astute, even incisive, in particular the soliloquies on our polarised, post-factual, digital age. But these observations didn't provoke in me much of a reaction beyond \"hmm, yes, that's very well observed\". It's all about our current moment, a moment which is so fraught, yet the words feel sort of bloodless. Where's the sting in this tale? This is sounding like a very critical review, but I don't really mean it that way. I really did enjoy the book. But I also felt the ghost of something better in the pages and so my expectations ran high.

My very first ARC and it\u2019s a RUSHDIE novel! Kindly indulge my victory pirouette before we proceed.As the inhabitants of a particularly depressing timescape (two weeks after I finished this book, Charlottesville happened!)\u2013 this epoch that marks the re-emergence of mainstream fascism, glorification of bigotry, justification of intolerance and vacillation of the entire planet towards right-wing fanaticism, we have very limited options when it comes to seeking solace from the cacophony of terrifying voices loaded with hatred. And The Golden House provides just that!After his previous outing with the explosive 2Y8M28N that fantastically traversed the dizzying clouds of magical realism, Salman Rushdie has landed in the land of realism with The Golden House \u2013 an almost-bespoke novel for the contemporary America that spans across the past decade and anatomizes every issue that managed to capture its collective consciousness. Conspicuous in its dearth of Rushdie\u2019s signature wordplay and elements of magical realism, The Golden House could easily be mistaken to be another writer\u2019s. But if you are a Rushdie fanboy, you\u2019d be comforted by his evident love of parables and the frequent parallels to Greek mythology scattered throughout the book. This book would appeal to those who\u2019d wanted to try Rushdie but were discouraged by the complexity of his earlier novels and even to those who hated his style. Rushdie tries on a new skin in this more-conventional novel where he retains his sheer genius without the whirling prose that may be intimidating to some. Rushdie fans get to see a different avatar of his; hesitant readers get to sunbathe in his delicious writing that\u2019s stripped off the elements they may not desire.The Golden Family comprises the puissant septuagenarian patriarch Nero Golden and his three sons who relocate to New York from an unspecified country (Guess!), haunted by a mysterious past that they\u2019re hell-bent on concealing. The story is narrated by an aspiring filmmaker who\u2019s on a desperate prowl for stories and finds his treasure in the Goldens who move to his posh neighborhood that is fondly referred to as The Gardens. Their precious past is slowly unraveled as he grows closer to the Golden Men and his dream project materializes as he peels off their fa\u00e7ade layer by layer. Rushdie meshes the story of the Goldens with the history of America before, during & after Obama\u2019s rule, Greek mythology, philosophizing and his commentary on American culture. The resulting product is colorful, captivating and extremely relevant in today\u2019s world.Echoes of Rushdie\u2019s previous novels can be frequently picked up in this story \u2013 especially Midnight\u2019s Children and Fury. Identity is one of the most important themes here, with Goldens expurgating their original identities to escape their crushing past and one of the characters undergoing gender transition. A very memorable passage in the book draws a beautiful parallel between a person undergoing gender transition and Gregor Samsa\u2019s despair in Metamorphosis.At times The Golden House felt like an American version of The Ministry of Utmost Happiness, chronicling the cultural and political issues consuming a whole nation; but narrated from the perspective of a wealthier, more selfish narrator. As we are carried forward from the election of Obama to the 2016 elections to Brexit to Aadhar cards, we are worried if these contemporary novels driven by concern for this depressing world are too obsessed with the NOW to make any sense in the future. Would this be remembered as well as Midnight\u2019s Children in twenty years? Is present contemporaneity bought at the cost of future\u2019s?"}, {"userName": "Paul Fulcher", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3250759-paul-fulcher", "userReview": "In these our cowardly times, we deny the grandeur of the Universal, and assert and glorify our local Bigotries, and so we cannot agree on much. In these our degenerate times, men bent on nothing but vainglory and personal gain\u2014 hollow, bombastic men for whom nothing is off-limits if it advances their petty cause\u2014 will claim to be great leaders and benefactors, acting in the common good, and calling all who oppose them liars, envious, little people, stupid people, stiffs, and, in a precise reversal of the truth, dishonest and corrupt. We are so divided, so hostile to one another, so driven by sanctimony and scorn, so lost in cynicism, that we call our pomposity idealism, so disenchanted with our rulers, so willing to jeer at the institutions of our state, that the very word goodness has been emptied of meaning and needs, perhaps, to be set aside for a time, like all the other poisoned words, spirituality, for example, final solution, for example, and (at least when applied to skyscrapers and fried potatoes) freedom. Salman Rushdie\u2019s mid-career novels, the Ground Beneath Her Feet and Fury were, in my view, not even close to the standard of his earlier works, and I know several fellow readers rather gave up on him at that point. But, as someone who persisted, Shalimar the Clown was powerful (and remains significantly underappreciated, largely as interest had diminished), The Enchantress of Florence delightful if somewhat whimsical, and Two Years Eight Months and Twenty-Eight Nights a wonderful story about the power of stories.I concluded my review of the latter (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show... \u201cbut trademark mannerisms aside, Rushdie is one of our finest writers, and the novel also showcases his wonderfully fertile imagination and his exuberant and yet erudite prose.\u201dOr as the narrator of Golden House puts it:I offer this brief CV now so that the reader may feel in good hands, the hands of a credible and not inexperienced storyteller, as my narrative acquires what will be increasingly lurid characteristics.  Unfortunately if Shalimar the Clown was a stunning return to form Golden House is a severe relapse. Rushdie is always simultaneously entertaining and frustrating but here the scales, at least for me, tipped the wrong way.The Golden House contains far too many topics I don\u2019t really care about, but more generally important, ones when Rushdie really has little to add but where he seems to have felt obliged, by his (deserved) status as a Great Novelist to opine.In terms of where I had little interest, Rushdie very effectively uses the Rear Window-esque device of having his narrator, Ren\u00e9 Unterlinden, being something of a voyeur into the lives of the family of Nero Golden. He then takes a meta-fictional approach, where Ren\u00e9 is himself writing a fictionalised version on what he sees: except Rushdie decided it would be more effective / original to have Ren\u00e9 be making a film rather than a book:For a while I went along with [him being a writer] and suddenly I woke up and thought that\u2019s a terrible idea. It would be better for him to be anything else \u2014 a dentist, an accountant, anything, so I thought, okay, he\u2019s not a writer, so what is he? And the minute the idea that he was a filmmaker showed up it actually released something in the writing of the book.(see http://www.thehindu.com/books/intervi...).As the narrator says, it\u2019s an interesting attempt to maybe mix up the genres, be a little genrequeer (that word the first sign of Rushdie foraying into areas he would have been better leaving alone) but it means that while literary references are certainly present, the novel is really aimed more at film buffs than book fans, with the narrative dominated by recollections and reflections of movie scenes (almost none of which I have seen).This also feels like an attempt to write that mythical thing Great American Novel (or at least The Great New York Novel) \u2013 but I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d want to read it even if it did exist. One of Rushdie\u2019s key points is how the events around Trump\u2019s election had led to an America torn in half, its defining myth of a city-on-a-hill exceptionalism lying trampled in the gutters of bigotry and racial and male supremacism, but that myth needed little trampling outside of the country.And indeed this seems more to The Great A Very Small Part of New York Novel, the book dedicated to the people who introduced him to a particularly exclusive piece of New York real estate, the Macdougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District (https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/29/fa...) \u2013 I\u2019m sure the detailed descriptions are highly fascinating to the 50 or so people that live there.As for topics, where Rushdie has nothing to add, for no particularly apparent reason, the novel features, purely in the background and of little relevance to the real story, the appearance of a caricature of Donald Trump, a property tycoon cum liberal-baiting Presidential candidate:Gary \u201cGreen\u201d Gwynplaine, a vulgarian whose name Nero could not bring himself to speak, and who liked to call himself the Joker on account of having been born with inexplicably lime-green hair. Purple-coated, white-skinned, red-lipped, Gwynplaine made himself the mirror image of the notorious cartoon villain and seemed to revel in the likeness. Albeit one does wonder whether this book was read as research in North Korea as at one point an ageing and increasingly mentally impotent character (albeit not the Joker) lets out as \"impotent dotard's shriek\"!And Rushdie\u2019s foray into identity politics ( \u201cWhat is it? All this language stuff. The 73 pronouns, all of that. I\u2019m a writer, I should know this\u201d \u2013 see https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...) is as ill-advised as Ian McEwan\u2019s in Nutshell, another author who I suspect felt obliged by his status to enter the fray.The shame is that all of this rather overshadows the underlying story of Nero Golden and his family, which presents the immigrant experience into New York: People who are born-and-raised New Yorkers are very proud of the fact. And rightly so. That\u2019s the kind of New York novel that is not mine to write. But I know that most of us who live here were not born here. So much of the story of New York is the story of arrival, the story of people coming from elsewhere, and I thought that\u2019s a story that I can tell. This was a very, very deliberate attempt to write a sort of immigrant novel of New York.https://bookpage.com/interviews/21741...And the parts of the novel that tell Nero Golden\u2019s back story, taking in the Mumbai underworld and the Nov 26 2008 and Mar 12 1993 terrorism attacks, was fascinating, with Rushdie demonstrating his tight control over his revelations (Patience. I will not reveal all my secrets at once).The story contains Rushdie\u2019s trade-mark blend of fantasy and realism: the narrator notes early on that in Roman times (from which Nero Golden takes his assumed name), a golden story \u201cwas a figure of speech that denoted a tall tale, a wild conceit, something that was obviously untrue.\u201dIndeed it is almost a relief to see Rushdie\u2019s signature touches, such as his delight in naming characters:There was a man called Don Corleone. No, of course that wasn't his name, but his name will mean nothing to you. Even the name he actually uses wasn't his name either. A name is nothing, it's a handle, as they say here, just a way of opening a door. 'Don Corleone' gives you an idea of the kind of man he was. Or per the authorial interview in The Hindu:I love naming. I think it\u2019s something to do with coming from our part of the world, where we think about the meaning of names. We don\u2019t just name children because it\u2019s a name that\u2019s in the family or because we like the sound of it. We give some form to what the name means and what its echoes are. So, I use that same technique for naming fictional characters. The two writers I admire for their naming are Charles Dickens and Saul Bellow. Uriah Heep! You already know who he is before he\u2019s even opened his mouth. You know who he is! And his terrible puns. One incidental character bore more than a passing resemblance to the retired Wimbledon champion Pat Cash. This was the individual charged with the task of rescuing Petya from his fear of open spaces. Petya's hypnotherapist. His name was Murray Lett. 'If you call me, it's not a fault,' he liked to say, a tennis joke that only served (ouch) to increase his resemblance to the former Australian star.He even throws in stereotypical dialogue: the narrator\u2019s Belgian parents speak with cod Belgian accents (\"a world vissout mystery iss like a picture vis no shadows ... it shows you nossing\") and have a shrine to Eddy Merckx, Magritte and Audrey Hepburn (an excuse for Rushdie to instruct us that she was born Edda van Heemstra), and our Australian tension coach speaks in strine (except Rushdie seems to have got confused with South African \"Virry well, thanks. I had ivry confidence\")But by the novel\u2019s end I felt rather like the narrator who, at one point, overwhelmed by the story declares:All I wanted to do was put my fingers in my ears and shout la la la la la. And yet, when his next novel comes out, I will be first in the queue to buy it."}, {"userName": "Bam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5922426-bam", "userReview": "This is the tale of an immigrant family, the Goldens, who come to America in 2008 and buy a mansion in a gated community of Art Deco homes. The backyards of the homes of the MacDougal-Sullivan Gardens Historic District form a park-like setting--\"a private, magic little place in the middle of downtown NY.\" They arrive in the city just as President Obama is being inaugurated, which ushers in a period of hope for the country. The head of the family calls himself Nero Julius Golden and his three adult sons are Petronius, Apuleius, and Dionysus--obviously adopted names. Where have they come from and what is their history? How had they become so wealthy? And what has happened to their mother? These are all mysteries to be debated by the curious neighbors.One such neighbor, Rene Unterlinden, a young would-be auteur, is the story's narrator. He decides to do a film about the family and, during the next ten years, befriends them, observes them and plans the scenes he will use for his debut work he will call The Golden House. Things begin to fall apart for the family, as each son has a fatal flaw and the father's sins begin to catch up with him. Is this karma at work? Kismet? Fate? In that way, this story is a morality tale.

Nero, the family's head is a billionaire and his sons Petya, Abu, and D all of whom have issues that seem to ruin their lives and determine their destiny. Into this arena of tortured souls comes an erstwhile filmmaker, Rene, who is the narrator of the family's tale. He is besotted with them and becomes a teller of their lives while becoming further meshed into it. Nero is a bachelor until he meets and marries the devious Vasilisa. She knows that in order to ingratiate herself further into Nero's graces she needs to produce an heir. Nero, a septuagenarian, is unable to father another child so Vasilisa tricks him into believing he can and does become pregnant through the help of Rene, who is quite willing to be of service.The family excites the residents of the small enclave in which they live while Rene's pursuit of them becomes almost one of a stalker. However, as he ingratiates himself into this family, he also finds himself in the midst of their crimes, their struggles, and their infidelities. As the story unfurls, we often find ourselves becoming exactly like Rene. Mr Rushdie is able through his writing to make the reader become Rene and look for the lascivious nature of the people he purports to care about. Here is where the story for this reader took steps backwards. In the telling this reader found very few if any characters to like. Added to the whole story is the backdrop of politics which seemed to be more of a rant by the author on his political stance. I found that it added nothing to the story since politically speaking the Goldens had little to do with politics as they tried to maintain the mysteries surrounding themselves. If Mr Rushdie had kept to his characters, this novel would have in my estimation been excellent. Instead it became a pedantic tale with his political feelings making up the weakness of the novel."}, {"userName": "Roman Clodia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56111743-roman-clodia", "userReview": "4.5 stars'The best had lost all conviction and the worst were filled with passionate intensity'It's been a while since I've enjoyed a Rushdie novel as much as this one. If you're looking, though, for a linear, coherent piece of storytelling (does anyone come to Rushdie for that?) then this might be unsatisfying. Instead it's a brilliant, exuberant piece of writing, all fireworks and brazen juggling of allusions: historical, filmic, literary. From the appropriations of Roman history and culture (Nero, Apuleius, Petronius, Ovid) to the final splitting apart of Yeats' 'The Second Coming' ('and the creature out of Spiritus Mundi rises up and slouches toward Washington, D.C., to be born), this reclaims art from the ravages of the financial elite currently dissing intellectual culture as 'elitist'. The fall of the house of Golden takes place in the space between the first election of Obama and the recent election of Trump, figured here as the Joker ('he was utterly and certifiably insane... America had left reality behind and entered the comic-book universe'), and ends with a fire that is also a warning: ('Hail Caesar. Remember Nero the last of his line').

Nevermind that some of history's greatest authors - from Chekov to Zweig to Hemingway - made their names largely as writers of short stories. And while accomplished novelists occasionally still put out a short story collection, they don't make a habit of it because shorter stories are sneered at by a literary community that believes an author who writes them does so only because he or she can't write a novel. It's that sort of nonsense that gives us books like \"The Golden House\" - a novel that might have made a fine 70-page story but is instead a pretentious, almost unreadable 370-page one. I certainly didn't care about the family at the center of the story because it's clear Rushdie doesn't care about them. They're merely characters filling pages to make a novel so Rushdie can espouse on what he really wants to write about - the current cultural and political climate in the U.S.It's not hard to envision Rushdie looking on with horrified amusement as we all were at the ascension to the throne of U.S. politics of a man as vulgar and certifiably insane as Donald Trump. \"How can I make a story out of this?\" He must have wondered. \"How can I create a novel out of what would fill an essay or short story?\" So out comes this absurd, bloated tale about a man who comes to America with his three sons in the hope of leaving his past behind.Full disclosure: I read about 70 pages of this before skimming the remaining 300. I would have stopped after the 70 and just left it, but I knew Rushdie was onto something with his portrayal of Trump - never mentioned by name - as \"the joker\" in the comic book universe that is modern-day America. Rushdie's pen has never bled venom as sweet as it does when focused on the chaos of the 2016 election. If only it wasn't for all the pretentious drivel that those few sections are buried under ...The Nick Carraway-esque narrator is a wannabe hotshot Hollywood director, so the classic film references fly fast and furious. But not only those. This twenty-something narrator, who never feels like a fully developed character so much as a blabbermouth encyclopedia that won't shut up, references anything and everything, sometimes multiple times in a single paragraph. When it's not a film reference it's literature or music. Bach is mentioned in the same breath as the Russian mythological old-witch-who-lives-in-the-forest Baba Yaga, as Rembrandt's \"Night Watch\", as the peculiarities of Somali pronunciation, as the name of an arrow in Sanskrit, as Borsalino hats - which, Rushdie informs us, are very popular among Orthodox Jews.Does it matter that these references are almost never related to the story Rushdie is half-heartedly telling? Of course not, because this isn't Ren\u00e9 Unterlinden - the 20-something-year-old narrator - talking, it's Rushdie, making sure we all know how much he knows. It's typical of Rushdie to projectile vomit all this pointless knowledge, needlessly complicating the text. There is no reader alive able to grasp all these references without turning to Google. That's what makes Rushdie's books so characteristically dense. Rushdie would never dream of simplifying things by, say, leaving out the information about the Somali pronunciation because, gasp, he wouldn't want Trump voters reading his books. Rushdie belongs to the class of writer who believes that the more unintelligible a book is, the better. God forbid it's read on the beach or is less than 300 pages! Now, occasionally Rushdie has shown that he's capable of such a good tale that I don't mind. The magical realism in which he writes many of his stories, like \"The Enchantress of Florence\", often carries me away. His bombastic, somewhat stylized writing fits well in that genre. The problem with such writing being set in the real world is that there's nothing real about it. Don't come knocking at the \"The Golden House\" - there's no one home."}], "description": "When powerful real-estate tycoon Nero Golden immigrates to the States under mysterious circumstances, he and his three adult children assume new identities, taking 'Roman' names, and move into a grand mansion in downtown Manhattan. Arriving shortly after the inauguration of Barack Obama, he and his sons, each extraordinary in his own right, quickly establish themselves at the apex of New York society.The story of the powerful Golden family is told from the point of view of their Manhattanite neighbour and confidant, Ren\u00e9, an aspiring filmmaker who finds in the Goldens the perfect subject. Ren\u00e9 chronicles the undoing of the house of Golden: the high life of money, of art and fashion, a sibling quarrel, an unexpected metamorphosis, the arrival of a beautiful woman, betrayal and murder, and far away, in their abandoned homeland, some decent intelligence work.Invoking literature, pop culture, and the cinema, Rushdie spins the story of the American zeitgeist over the last eight years, hitting every beat: the rise of the birther movement, the Tea Party, Gamergate and identity politics; the backlash against political correctness; the ascendency of the superhero movie, and, of course, the insurgence of a ruthlessly ambitious, narcissistic, media-savvy villain wearing make-up and with coloured hair.In a new world order of alternative truths, Salman Rushdie has written the ultimate novel about identity, truth, terror and lies. A brilliant, heartbreaking realist novel that is not only uncannily prescient but shows one of the world\u2019s greatest storytellers working at the height of his powers.", "title": "The Golden House", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34068590-the-golden-house", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1518781254l/34068590.jpg", "reviews": 808, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3299.Salman_Rushdie", "name": "Salman Rushdie"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction", "Abandoned"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34068590-the-golden-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34128285-the-golden-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34197420-the-golden-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36112642-the-golden-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36214279-the-golden-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34211824-the-golden-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34497409-the-golden-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36167692-golden-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34211825-the-golden-house", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14836.Midnight_s_Children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12781.The_Satanic_Verses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4835.Haroun_and_the_Sea_of_Stories", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1317696.The_Enchantress_of_Florence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4830.Shalimar_the_Clown"]}
