A young woman is pressed for time when her Italian parents present her with a contract that says she must marry and conceive a child by the time her 25th birthday arrives if she wants to receive a s**t ton of money from her wealthy parents. And, Ricadonna is running out of time. She only has five months until that day. OMG she's gone on so many dates, and each guy is absolutely not for her! Too WEIRD! Too NERDY! Too OBNOXIOUS! And, Too GAY! With that being said, when she meets cocky and arrogant Luke Hamilton, she's not impressed with his attitude. But, he is one gorgeous guy! Red hair, green eyes, and a body to die for. And, when he smirks, he's just beautiful! Can a guy be considered beautiful?? Yeah, why the hell not! But, it's obviously he's not Italian. And, her parents would kill if she married anything other than one. It doesn't stipulate that she must marry one in the contract, however. Unfortunately Luke is keeping his private life a secret from Rica. He doesn't talk about his parents or any other family members. What's he hiding? Rica knows that when Luke's ready, he'll tell her. She just has to wait it out. But, before Luke can tell her his story, the truth comes out but in a not so honest way. Will Luke be able to win Rica back? Will Rica fulfill her contract with her parents?I loved Rica and Luke! They were funny and passionate! Together, they just clicked. And, Luke took such good care of Rica. He was the perfect boyfriend. It was his guilt from an act in the past that had him so torn up, though. Rica was such an accepting person, however. If had just told her the truth and had been honest with her from the very beginning, he could have avoided his imminent heartbreak. Some of the story was a little over the top, but that's the beauty of fiction. An author can write anything they choose hoping that their audience will enjoy the story. And, this was an ENJOYABLE story! I was so rooting for Rica and Luke to get their \"happily ever after\". As the reader, you will just have to dive in to see if this awesome couple eventually ends up together. Another engaging love story by Vicki Green...And, how about that cover?? That guy is just so gorgeous! He's exactly how I pictured Luke. Perfect casting!!"}, {"userName": "soleilLaluna", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49881207-soleillaluna", "userReview": "I was excited and eager to read this book after the blurb.

It felt very rushed and unrealistic. Then again, people do a lot of crazy things for money.Anyone can guess what this story is about just by reading the story synopsis. Rica is from a high society Italian family that wants her to settle down, have a baby before she's 25, and her beau HAS TO be Italian as well.Enter Luke. Luke is everything Rica's family does not want for her. He's NOT Italian... he's Scottish... and his questionable background and motives spell trouble with a capital T. Just what is he hiding? And can his non-Italian break the boundaries of pure Italian breeding?So.....basically that's the story in a jiffy. Just so you guys know, it does move really fast. It almost seems like an insta-love even though it's not. It's just an instant attraction leads to the male lead deciding that he's going to fulfill the female lead's contract needs by the second meeting and everything taking off from there. I was really baffled by Rica's family and their outrageous demands of their daughter. I mean, wow. And Rica and Luke. Even if it falls to money, I was like \"woah\" to them deciding to commit to those terms when knowing nothing about each other.Anyway, I think this book might appeal to lots but I was Switzerland on it."}, {"userName": "Vicki Green", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20378242-vicki-green", "userReview": "It's LIVE!US: http://amzn.to/2kDcwomUK: http://amzn.to/2kGe4h7AU: http://amzn.to/2lGnHAE"}, {"userName": "OKbook Hoarder", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40663594-okbook-hoarder", "userReview": "I absolutely love Rica and Luke's story.

Rica is the only daughter of a pair of overbearing and eccentric Italian parents, who decide that she must be in love, married and at least have a baby on the way by her twenty fifth birthday in order to receive an inheritance. Rica is stubborn, loyal and completely selfless. She works tirelessly for charity, and her path to finding a happy ever after and fulfilling her parents requirements is not easy. Rica and Luke meet through a charity event, and he's not exactly what her parents had in mind. Luke is cocky and arrogant, but also sweet, and caring and very genuine, but he has secrets and he is very closed off. This is quite a fast paced read, and although it's told from a dual point of view, the majority of the book is told from the heroine Rica's point of view. I really enjoyed the chapters that were told from Luke's view point, and they really gave me a greater insight into his character and it was those chapters that really endeared him to me. Rica and Luke's story has a bit of everything it's heartwarming, yet heartbreaking and at times quite humorous and fun. This is about family, love and loyalty. Overall an engaging and entertaining read and I look forward to reading more of Ms Green's work in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor additional reviews visit\u00a0Ebook Indulgence"}, {"userName": "Shellby", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4541751-shellby", "userReview": "OH MY GOD!!

The love that parents have for their children, the hopes and dreams that they will one day find a happiness that will last them a lifetime. The love between the most unlikely of characters, the sort that falls into place and refuses to listen to reason. The sort of love that won\u2019t be denied, the sort of love that is bone deep and that you know in your soul is right and that you will fight to have even if everyone else tells you, that you shouldn\u2019t.This is all of that and more."}, {"userName": "Janna \u2665 I'm A Sweet And Sassy Book Whore \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6903437-janna-i-m-a-sweet-and-sassy-book-whore", "userReview": "***This and other reviews can be found at www.imasweetandsassybookwhore.com ****ARC*When I read the blurb for Time\u2019s Up! to say that I was intrigued would be putting it mildly. A contact that you signed with your parents stating you would be in love, married and pregnant by the time you hit 25 years old to get your money from them? This isn\u2019t an arraigned marriage story by any means but I will say the plot was one I hadn\u2019t read before at least not like this. Time\u2019s Up! is a romantic comedy that is packed with drama and a side of secrets. While I enjoyed Time\u2019s Up!, I feel that some parts were too drawn out and some of the characters started to get on my nerves, the main one being Rica our heroine. She is feisty. Stubborn and sassy but at the same time I just wanted her to be more. And I got it you, your family and friends are Italian I don\u2019t need to be reminded of that fact a million times throughout the book, okay maybe not a million but after a while I was over it. Rica while a character I wanted to love unfortunately ended up being one that I barely tolerated. Luke now he made me want to continue forward with the story. He was cocky, he was arrogant, he was sweet and he was determined. I wish we would have had more POVs from his character but the ones we did get I enjoyed. He has secrets. Did he screw up? Yes but before you send a mob after him he didn\u2019t do anything that bad. I honestly felt more for him and his feelings than I did Rica\u2019s in the book. I think that the story was just too drawn out, I understood why the author put it in there but after a bit I just wanted it to move forward. Certain things seemed to be swept under the rug and Rica did not take any ownership in her part of the problem and that bothered me. Communication is key people, communication is key. While I am not saying that I loved this one I did overall enjoy it and I think others will as well, and it very well could be it is a me not the book situation going on here."}, {"userName": "Tracy- OMGReads", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47269696-tracy--omgreads", "userReview": "Times Up is an off the wall romantic comedy. The adventure Rica finds herself on, a path forced by her parents, is one of love, heartbreak and loving your family through it all. Rica, an Italian girl, with Italian friends, finds her ultimate rebellion with a non-Italian, Luke. She's loyal, a bit too stubborn and surrounded by a large, overbearing, yet well-meaning, family. Luke is a lovable guy, however he does take a while to warm up to. He crashes his way into Rica's life and is constantly keeping her on her toes. Times Up is a fun read.

I don't think I can keep it clean and say what I need to say. First, I love Luke. Yes he messed up by not sharing his past, and the reason he didn't wasn't based in reality. How could he think that what happened would make him look bad?! He also had a little bit of a materialistic way about him, buying extremely extravagant things instead of being practical. Rica. She was very immature and a bit of a brat. How she behaved toward Luke after that night was awful. And having intentions of not involving him in his child's life?! Not right!

At first when I started this I thought it would be cute because I have read contract romances before. What brings this one to life is the characters-Rica and Luke. Rica also has a boisterous family that plays abit in this. When she does go out with him after he overhears a conversation, not first time seeing him either which got her meter going, she crazy goes along with him because he is that good. Thing is there is only so much time in a contract that left out one thing \"Italian\" lol. Anyways as they go on with this you will be wondering about Luke because things will come to surface and be said that will pick at your curiosity. He will melt your heart like he does to her. Another thing is watch out for those deals they can be dangerous. Things go on a roll but there is a bit of trouble from a sibling. When things do explode your heart will too. My or my she will pull on the emotions left and right in this one but I will tell you when things do go south I am on his side and abit upset with her.
