Start from the beginning, you don't want to miss the fun. Something happens in book two that causes Ivy to see ghosts now. It is hilarious! This whole series has kept me laughing. It is a fun series with lots of action, crazy characters, (especially her cat Brutus my favorite), and so much more! This is my new favorite series and I read or listen to over 900 books a year. Be sure to read book 4 too! it isn't in audible.The narrator is super awesome!

It'd be better to read both if you want the full backstory (and you probably do).I liked this one as much as the first. We again have Winter and Ivy working together and that rocked. The difference is that they both want to be working together, finally, and I'm happy to say that Harper managed to make the transition to a stable relationship and still keep the character interactions interesting. Indeed, I think their banter is better now that they have a solid foundation of trust and respect to base it on. It could help that some of their exchanges resemble those between me and Melissa more than a little.The world-building is as light as it ever was, but the story slightly stronger in this one. Which is a bit strange because this is the first time in the series that we have a villain who is outright evil and with fewer redirects and red herrings. Harper makes this work by giving him understandable (though creepy) motivations and keeping the character consistent. Depicting an evil guy who outwits a bunch of people (including our main heroes, sometimes) is tricky and the temptation to pull author caveats that manipulate things in his favor is strong. I think it held together well, though, and I can be a stickler for these things. Part of that is that it wasn't all one-sided\u2014in other words, while the bad guy sometimes outwitted our heroes, they got their own in on him occasionally, too.The weakest part of this novel was the continuing unpunished screw-ups by Torquin. Man, that guy just grates. The only way he isn't dragging the whole story down is that he shows up sparingly enough I don't get completely impatient when he pushes into a scene. Still, I'd dearly like an anvil to fall on his head. Preferably one thrown by the latest victim of his grandiose blathering.Anyway, this is a personal five-star rating and likely a result of a beneficial interaction between being in the right mood and taste alignment.A note about romance and steamy/chaste: This isn't really a romance at all, though the main characters do go from not being together to being together. There's no steam and even the kissing is kept pretty low-key. And that's a good thing, I think. The main relationship concerns with these two is their emotional intimacy and Harper illustrates that through their banter and (fully-clothed) byplay. We know they're having sex, but it's pretty much all inferred by them sharing living space. I'd mark all three novels (so far) as chaste if they were romances, but since they aren't..."}, {"userName": "KatieV", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18620847-katiev", "userReview": "Lol.

And they're an intrusive and demanding bunch, which is a bit of a problem for someone like Ivy who has dedicated her life to not really doing much at all. As an incentive for Ivy to help the ghosts they let her know about the actions of a mass murderer of witches and soon Ivy and Winter are on the case.This series continues to surprise with it being funny and light entertainment even though the content can be quite dark. The author also goes to some trouble to make each of the books cover quite different material as well as evolving the basic premise around Ivy as slacker and Winter as workaholic. Even Ivy's familiar Brutus (probably the funniest character in the series) gets some solid character moments.I continue to recommend this urban fantasy series."}, {"userName": "Treece", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1646176-treece", "userReview": "Rating: 4 starsWell. That was fun.This book provides loads of laughs despite some of the dark content. Ivy and Rafe are terrific together and apart. Although in this book they are together mostly. Brutus.

I enjoyed this series and I am not interested in pointing out what didn't work for me at times. That is not important. What is important is that I laughed a lot listening to this.

Helen Harper is a very talented author and from her output obviously not lazy like Ivy. I've read her Highland Magic series and this Lazy girl series and the characters and plots have all been excellent, but it's the little touches that she puts in her books that make them worthwhile. For instance, her cat Brutus jumps in a box as any cat lover knows, cats love to do. Ivy closes the lid on the box and whispers to Brutus \"Now we don't know whether you're alive or dead.\"I hope this isn't the final book in the series, I'd really like to see where Ivy goes from here."}, {"userName": "Al *the serial series skipper*", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4167077-al-the-serial-series-skipper", "userReview": "Our lazy witch extraordinaire is back at it again.

This was an easy one! I loved it! Ivy is the most hilarious witch and the double act between her and Rafe is just brilliant. They are a perfect couple now! In this one, Ivy has some serious and somewhat irritating side effects as a result of the spell she cast at the end of Star Witch and an investigation into a mass murder comes about because of these side effects. She can now talk to ghosts and is apparently the one in the entire world who can. Now this is where it gets irritating for Ivy as everywhere she goes a ghost seems to pop up to chat to her. Sometimes they are helpful, but more often than not they are demanding and rude. However, Ivy does need their help in catching the murderer, but he is always one step ahead of Ivy and Rafe's investigation. I loved the thrill of this book. Every time it felt like Ivy and Rafe were getting closer in working out who the murderer was or where he might be, they were just that little bit too late to do anything. Ivy was definitely not a lazy witch in this book, as much as she would have liked to be! I know this is the last book in this series, but here I am hopefully wishing that Helen will revisit this series or these characters one day as I have loved reading about them and sharing their relationship and magical journey with them.

This book was really really good. I adored Winter and Ivy together. They were great, and very funny as well. And as always I loved Ivy as well. And then the ending was sort of sad, and strange.

I like Ivy a lot and I like the fact that she doesn't spend one second apologizing for being lazy or unfit. I also like the fact that we're seeing a newly in-love couple and that the story does not revolve around breaking them up - or a love triangle - the silliness of young lovers is actually funny and endearing - why don't we see this more?

But the ghosts tell her about a serial killer that nobody but his victims know about yet and Ivy is too good of a person to ignore that info.All the old characters are back.

I can take having plot holes and having a lot of editing mistakes but I really can't take annoying or boring characters. I really liked the characters here, especially Brutus. I gave it 4 points because I found the scene with Ivy meeting Winter's parents lacking. Why does his dad keep looking at Ivy that way? Seriously? Why isn't he freaking out that there's a talking cat like all the others? Also, I would have loved to hear more about Ivy's family as well.

Although the subject matter is quite dark, the author keeps the writing light with Ivy's internal monologue, banter with partner Winter, and the humor of her demanding cat. It's a little longer than the last 2, I'd say, but still a fairly quick and easy read.
