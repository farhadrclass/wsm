My favorite review of Dept. of Speculation was written by Cameron on Goodreads: \"I underlined basically the entire novel.\"2. The publisher's synopsis says, \"Exceptionally lean and compact, Dept. of Speculation can be read in a single sitting, but there are enough bracing emotional insights in these pages to fill a much longer novel.\" While my first reading was interrupted, I did manage to finish it the next evening. Maggie and I have been married for nineteen years, so I can relate to whisper fights, the \"Little Theater of Hurt Feelings,\" and even hair pulling. This especially rings true:The husband and wife whisper-fight now in the gloves-off approved way. She calls him a coward. He calls her a bitch. But still they aren\u2019t that good at it yet. Sometimes one or the other stops in the middle and offers the other a cookie or a drink.3. An excerpt from Dept. of Speculation, which does not have an index:The wife is reading Civilization and Its Discontents, but she keeps getting lost in the index.Analogiesbare leg on a cold night, 40cautious businessman, 34guest who becomes a permanent lodger, 53Polar expedition, ill equipped, 98\n4. Dept. of Speculation is a mosaic of fun facts, quotations, and short observations. The result is concise, expressive, and a little gimmicky. I wanted to warn people to wear pithy helmets while reading the novel, but this pun has already been taken.5. Some of the best passages in Dept. of Speculation are of the narrator reimagining events in her life as fictitious scenes in the second novel she's struggling to write. In real life, Jenny Offill's previous novel, \nLast Things\n, was published in 1999, fifteen years ago.6. From author Dana Spiotta's advance praise: \"Dept. of Speculation is ... very much about how it feels to be alive right now.\" Midway through the novel, the narrator's apartment is infested with bedbugs, and bedbugs have been in the news a lot, lately. Interestingly, the word \"bedbugs\" was removed from some versions of the publisher's descriptions of the book. Compare the cached image below to the current Amazon page:\n7. From author Michael Cunningham's advance praise: \"Dept. of Speculation is ... as compact and mysterious as a neutron.\" In the novel, the narrator describes how Russian cosmonaut Vladimir Komarov was killed when his space capsule plummeted to Earth in 1967, and that since his body was unrecoverable, all his widow ended up with was his charred heel bone.8. This excerpt from Dept. of Speculation reminds me of Roz Chast's neurotic New Yorker cartoons:The longer she sits [on the toilet] the more she notices how dingy and dirty the bathroom is. There is a tangle of hair on the the side of the sink, some kind of creeping mildew on the shower curtain. Their towels are no longer white and are fraying along the edges. Her underwear too is dinged nearly gray. The elastic is coming out a little. Who would wear such a thing? What kind of repulsive creature?Roz Chast and Jenny Offill share a similar sense of humor, they are both Brooklynites, and they've both written children's books. But unlike Chast's cartoons, bemusement succumbs to fell rage and black despair in Offill's Dept. of Speculation. On a happier note, Roz Chast has a new memoir coming out in May 2014, \nCan't We Talk about Something More Pleasant?: A Memoir\n.9. According to the New York Times Media Decoder blog, Jenny Offill's agent Sally Wofford-Girand described Dept. of Speculation this way: \"If your average book is a body, this is an X-ray.\" The literati must have agreed; more than eight publishing houses bid on it and a two-book deal was reportedly made for about $500,000. Dept. of Speculation is being published by Knopf on January 28, 2014.

Dept. of Speculation by Jenny Offill, writer of the marvelous children\u2019s book (and staple of my daughter\u2019s bedtime routine) Sparky!, delivers an emotionally charged account of adulthood across marriage, childrearing, and the pains of infidelity that opens wide each moment to explore the blood of life within. Reminiscent of Renata Adler\u2019s Speedboat, Offill offers brief snippets of life-as-lived that build a beautiful collage of the narrator\u2019s existence. Sprinkled with scientific facts, philosophical quandaries and literary quotes, Offill does well by avoiding a straightforward surface telling of story in Dept. of Speculation that instead progresses through abstract connections to better occupy the mind and soul of her narrator; a wonderful approach that unfortunately feels a bit stale and preoccupied with accessibility and emotion rather than depth and beauty. \u2018There are 60 seconds in a minute, 60 minutes in an hour, 24 hours in a day, 7 days in a week, 52 weeks in a year, and X years in a life. Solve for X.\u2019Dept. of Speculation is quite a charming little novel, full of great spirit and humor. It feels very alive, very close and always tugging the heart strings. I particularly enjoyed the moments involving the baby daughter and the wonderment watching all her eccentricities as she begins to age and the way Offill constructs and immediacy to this unique window into the world around us. The style keeps us locked within the narrator and all her own quirks, learning to empathize and understand her through examples of life which keeps us connected when the bottom drops out for her after her husband\u2019s infidelity. There is a sudden shift from the \u2018I\u2019 to the third-person\u2014 \u2018the wife\u2019 and \u2018the husband\u2019\u2014which pulls the reader from such closeness to a colder impersonal perspective as she too finds herself on the outside of her own life. Subtlety and the unspoken meanings inherent in technique are of the many positive techniques employed by Offill that help the novel shimmer. Rarely is anything ever direct and it is typically through abstract association that the reader is able to deduce the truth behind the events that transpire. Even then the story is never fully formed and the readers imagination must commingle with the narrator\u2019s inward observations to flesh out the story through a cooperative effort that further connects the reader to the character. The husband\u2019s affair is never plainly stated at first, and it is the story of Carl Sagan leaving his wife for Ann Druyan while working on the Voyager Golden Record that supplies the context to be assumed when the husband and wife reach a breaking point\u00b9 Other things are not so suble, such as the bedbug infestation in the couples first apartment being a foreshadowing of parasites in the marriage bed, but these metaphors still work wonderfully.The style, with the quick snippets of life interspersed with facts and quotes, reads like David Markson-lite. While the style does help investigate the character from an abstract perspective that feels very intimate, it also feels as if it is used more for the sake of seeming experimental than actually being experimental. Speculation toys with po-mo techniques without really being po-mo itself (the novel is rather straight-forward despite the impression of not being so), and seems to be akin to the way David Mitchell takes more popular fiction plots and bridges them towards a more literary bent. Which isn\u2019t a complaint necessarily, more an observation that the style is more flashy than substantial and has been done many times before and done better. Perhaps if the book didn\u2019t continuously feel like it was focused more on plot (and pushing the plot forward with a bit too heavy of a hand) than the philosophical ideas presented. The quotes and facts seem more there for charm and quirkiness than to provide actual depth; the factoids used are like the sort of things you read on a cereal box, fun and thought-provoking, but not very functional. Offill seems to recognize this and keeps things fun and provides a few metafictional aspects of the character seemingly writing this story from scraps of paper she scrawls in times of stress\u00b2 She also attempts to keep the story feeling relatable through very modern and non-affected writing that often has the feel of reading someones Facebook statuses. They are full of snarky charm, cursing, pop-culture phrases and other \u2018normal-person in the real world\u2019 colloquialisms. At times it made me wish she could spin a better phrase that would cut to the core, but it was used consistently and helped create a believable character.\u2018She thinks before she acts. Or more properly, she thinks instead of acts. A character flaw, not a virtue.\u2019Dept of Speculation is a quick read that takes the reader by the heart through the narrator\u2019s adulthood of trials and tribulations. While it is not quite the work of brilliance than many have championed it, the book is also nowhere near as bad as its detractors have claimed and it is still a powerful book despite a few minor grievances. Offill does well to pull at the heart strings, though this does often seem more a novel that forces you to feel the emotion rather than let the emotion rise up naturally. The style is rather engaging and allows for a fun and insightful look into the character and her world, but feels stale but Offill covers this staleness up with rich, warm, emotional butter to still pull off a palatable treat of fiction. 3.5/5'But now it seems possible that the truth about getting older is that there are fewer and fewer things to make fun of until finally there is nothing you are sure you will never be.'\u00b9 There is an irony that the narrator finds Carl and Ann\u2019s story to be romantic despite knowing it involved a double infidelity yet cannot apply the same perspective towards her husband\u2019s affair. \u2018The only love that feels like love is the doomed kind. (Fun fact.)\u2019 Perhaps this also comments on the shift from first- to third-person as she sees an affair is easier to gloss over from the outside.\u00b2 Perhaps I had read both Adler\u2019s Speedboat and Luiselli\u2019s Faces in the Crowd too soon before this one and Speculation fades from the comparison. However, this book shares many key aspects of both, such as the scrap writing or being friends with a philosopher like the narrator in Faces. Which is a problem with this book, it just feels like the heartfelt moments of many other books all blended into one without taking any of these elements into a fresh direction or perspective."}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283951-eve", "userReview": "Indulging in my love of audio books has become more challenging since I quit my job, and no longer have a two and a half hour commute to get lost in a dreamy book. I've taken to having a special ME day once a week. The ritual revolves around my complicated and needy hair. The process of pre-shampooing, washing, deep conditioning, detangling, and finally braiding my hair into tiny segments occupies about 3-4 hours sometimes. I used to put it off until I absolutely had a knotted mess on my hands. I decided to use this time to get back into my audio book routine. It's helped tremendously! I enjoy my day, get some reading in, and if the book is especially good, I'll find other things I need to tweak just to keep listening, like a manicure and/or pedicure, or even attending to my larger than life eyebrows. This short little book consumed my whole morning today. Even late into tonight, I'm still pondering why I loved it so much. The lame comeback? This stuff is real. Reminds me of why I love Bergman films, especially the tortourous Scenes From a Marriage. It's real. Focusing on the protagonist's life before marriage, after marriage, motherhood, and the complications from imperfect relationships, I was especially drawn to the \"wife's\" constant choice of family over career. Her inner doubts about being a good wife, mom, sister, and friend touched me deeply. I fell in love with her character and just wanted to extend a huge hug. \"You're not alone and you can and will get through this,\" kept running through my mind as I pulled my comb through my fastidious curls.

The original format of this novel \u2013 it\u2019s written as a kind of literary scrapbook of musings, quotes and insights - reminded me at times of Fellini\u2019s brilliant film about the fount of inspiration, 8 \u00bd. Like the film director in Fellini\u2019s film, Offill\u2019s writer is bereft of inspiration, which sets her on an odyssey to sift through the rubble of her past in search of nuggets of insight. One of the many brilliant vignettes is her discovery that her baby who rarely stops crying finds solace under very bright fluorescent lights. This means she takes him to the corner store every day and just idles away inside for as long as possible without drawing too much attention to herself. It\u2019s such a brilliant dramatization of how much time motherhood demands you waste! The early years of motherhood are not an uninterrupted crooning of delight. But she does the delight too, and does it very well. The same goes for her cheating husband \u2013 \u201cThe thing is this: Even if the husband leaves her in this awful craven way, she will still have to count it as a miracle, all of those happy years she spent with him.\u201d She achieves the clarity of inspiration \u2013 she can see every event from all sides. It loses a star for me because I began to feel it lost momentum towards the end. The novel deserved a more daring and satisfactory denouement.

It's told in 46 chapters composed of short paragraphs and almost aphoristic lines and quotes in 160 compact pages. The narrator, the Wife, goes from being a young woman who considers being an Art Monster, a person who lives solely for the creation of their art, to a wife and a mother. It's set mostly in Brooklyn, but that shouldn't be held against it. It's not one of those Park Slope mommy books that seem to be a thing lately. I had mixed feelings about this book. I found much of the writing to be great, and the individual lines and paragraphs to be interesting, sometimes in that fleeting kind of, 'you are saying something exactly that I've thought about before' kind of way, sort of in a less gloom filled way that reading E.M. Cioran can be.

It doesn\u2019t matter anyway. The thing landed on, like, every Best Of 2014 list in the universe, probably even half-assedly scribbled onto fast food napkins. But here\u2019s the thing: I didn\u2019t just love this book, I fucking loved it. I felt passionate and heart-beaty about it. I touched words on pages and sighed like they were images in a yearbook or whatever. I turned my copy into origami, what with all the dog-earing. I thought these out-of-character words so many times: \u201cThis book is absolutely gorgeous.\u201d Here\u2019s the thing with book recs: Sometimes you read something and it\u2019s great and you just generically tell your readerly-inclined friends (or internet cruisers) that it\u2019s got your seal. Sometimes you read something and you think, \u201cOh my. Know who\u2019d love this?\u201d And you try to explain to said person that it\u2019s crucial they read this book, like, yesterday, all while remembering that you really, seriously, freaking hate when someone tells you to read a certain book (unless they are on a preapproved list of people who understand how and what and why you read). Here\u2019s the gist of \u201cDept. of Speculation\u201d: A woman living in Brooklyn meets a man who makes soundscapes and falls in love and they get married and make a baby. It all goes against this sort of master plan she had to become an Art Monster -- a rarity for women, she notes, but she would be a person who only thinks about art and is never burdened by the mundane. Nabakov, she points out, didn\u2019t even fold his own umbrella. TThere is a breach in the relationship. The man gets into it with another woman and the narrator spends a lot of time in this weird limbo of trying to figure out the status of her family. Is he in, is he out and all that. But the story is written in these really super short paragraphs, just scraps of barely vignettes, that give just enough details to what is happening. In between are fun facts about Buddhist teachings and interactions with her sister or her friend a philosopher or memories. This is, style-wise, brilliant. The writing is super concise and the words feel like they\u2019re more honest, worth more emotional weight. There is all this white space where who-knows-what is happening and it\u2019s, as I\u2019ve said, so gorgeous. I actually had this thought while reading Offill\u2019s book, which is like this wide-open ticking wound of a story. \u201cI can\u2019t recommend this to anyone because they wouldn\u2019t appreciate it because they are not me.\u201d (If *that* doesn\u2019t make me sound like I carry a selfie stick \u2026)I\u2019ve come through the romantic fog. I know this wasn\u2019t written for me. But the way she writes about her baby feels so intensely personal -- in this way that those conversational \u201cWhat to Expect\u201d books promise to be, but aren\u2019t -- that I actually felt a little embarrassed because these are my secrets. \u201cI remember the first time I said the word to a stranger. \u2018It\u2019s for my daughter,\u2019 I said.

If she would lie quietly with me, if I could bury my face in her hair, yes, then yes, uncle.\u201d Or there were lines like this: \u201cThe reason to have a home is to keep certain people in and everyone else out\u201d which I wanted to needlepoint onto a throw pillow."}, {"userName": "\u00b7Karen\u00b7", "userReviewDate": "Jul 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen", "userReview": "There are blowsy baroque behemoths that spill the entire contents of the fridge onto your reading table (and let you do the cooking, and the clearing up afterwards too sometimes), and then there are the delicate offerings, the distilled essence from the alembic, an extract that carries, within a tiny drop, sweetness, tartness, acidity, all at once.

I was slaloming between the poles of philosophy and literature at the time and trying to get them to merge in some elegant way or at least not crash into a tree. I was grabbed there on 12th Street by how she alluded to Wittgenstein and Nabokov back-to-back, insisting that they belonged together, not to mention Scheherazade and a trapped raccoon and an affair which we see in the shadows and the wings and hear in echoes and stubborn silences. It was the first time I'd noticed a deckled edge on a book, and it seemed fitting for a thing that seemed to want to feel unpolished and shun smoothness of any sort. I went on to write my thesis on Wittgenstein and Adler, jazz improvisation and storytelling, symmetries made and broken, and other stuff that I can't remember anymore. Adler's book blew me away because it felt--in language and form alike--stripped down, yanked inside-out, exposed, nervy and raw. The words were like a row of naked defenders at a penalty kick that never quite happens, an ongoing state of uneasy vigilance itself the goal. I bring this up now partly because Offill's writing recalls Adler's work, now celebrated (she's taken a Lazarus-like turn off the remainder shelf) in both form and tone, or maybe the better word is \"pulse.\" Others have pointed out the connection, most notably Roxane Gay, who describes Offill's latest novel in the NYTimes Book Review as, \"at times, reminiscent of Renata Adler\u2019s 'Speedboat' with a less bitter edge.\" No question, Dept. of Speculation shares that quality of leaping from observation to observation, from memory to scholarly citation, anecdote to meta-anecdote, teeming with musings on marriage and motherhood, teaching, getting from point A to G, and the quiet, often hidden slapstick that can accompany each of these. There are fewer non-sequiturs in Offill, fewer head-scratching moments; she's quite easy to follow. I'm partial--pun intended, I suppose--to this form, which seems to be a counterweight to our longing for continuity. For doesn't a long, thick novel, broken only at the chapter-joints, promise us that we can sink in and immerse ourselves, that it will envelope us wholly (I'm thinking about you, two out of the three Pulitzer fiction finalists this year)? And I'll admit, I'm hardly immune to the allure of being swept away like that by the high tide in an ocean of prose. But reading Offill reminds me of the pleasures of the staccato, the skittery, the odd and end, the pond and the puddle. Of course, the tradition of the fragment goes back long before Adler, and as a literary and epistemological phenomenon has been lauded by people like David Shields--even had its moment on the Colbert Report. The form goes back to Heraclitus at least, and his love of tension and contradiction are evident throughout Speculation, though Offill also names a bunch of other early philosophers, from Thales to the Stoics, rather than planting a stake firmly in one patch of philosophical ground. To borrow Zadie Smith's metaphor of literature as a \"big tent,\" Offill's tent is small but somehow roomy, and bustling with entertaining company.I'd say the book succeeds as well as it does by altering our sense of proportion, as we acclimate to its rhythms, its spaces and gaps, its refusal to step back too much and take in any grand view. There are real facts and pseudo-facts, definitions and redefinitions, jokes and inverted jokes, lists and indices, scientific pr\u00e9cis and sampled lyrics and imagined conversations and confessions. Together these make their own tides. One of the most powerful strands in the book is that of outer space, and in particular of the Voyager missions, including the \"Golden Record\" of sounds assembled by Sagan and Co. to showcase humanity in all its (non-sexual and non-violent) glory to some alien version of eyes and ears. Apart from going behind the scenes and delving into the private lives and romantic entanglements of the scientists behind Voyager, reminding us how human they were all along, Offill aptly describes these missions as \"messages in a bottle, but thrown into outer space rather than the ocean.\" As she points out, one will pass within 1.7 light-years of the red dwarf Ross 248 in a mere 40,000 years. What, in other words, could be more fragmentary than flinging this splinter of humanity into the void; yet, too, what could be more grand and tinged with hope?"}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75157-carol", "userReview": "The plot depiction is disjointed and resembles the ramblings of a bi-polar patient off his/her meds.

At first it seemed like an almost random stream of disconnected short paragraphs, but it soon becomes clear that the book has a core narrative that tells what would otherwise be a fairly humdrum and universal story of a failing marriage. The plot is the least important thing in this book - it is full of memorable observations and thoughts on a wide variety of subjects.It falls loosely into two halves - the first is told from the woman's point of view, and follows the relationship through the first five years of their daughter's life. There is then a sudden switch to a more neutral third person narrator when the husband has an affair with a young colleague, and this part of the book becomes more focused with fewer digressions, but perhaps less interesting too.

This gives the reader several fragmented but intimate glimpses into the couple\u2019s relationship at critical points in time. The author really nails that sleep-deprived, frustration only the parent a newborn with colic would understand.

But then not too far along, something clicked and I 'got' it. There's a major difference to the stories themselves, but to state what that is might be a spoiler for either.The few similarities are what struck me, though, (and I wonder if I would've caught them if not for Karen's planting the Ferrante seed in my brain): ...a day of mental illness, one that had its beginnings in previous days... Yet to call it mental illness (and no one does) is probably inaccurate (as I wrote in my review of The Days of Abandonment); the paring of the skin of a fruit into one unbroken strip by a parent to entertain a child; and a neighbor woman getting fat after being abandoned by her husband for a younger woman (though to be honest, I remember that element from My Brilliant Friend, though it might've been in The Days of Abandonment as well).The story of Buddha's naming his child \"Fetters\" and then abandoning the baby, because of course there's a Mrs. Buddha, has stayed with me.

And that's exactly the sort of thing that maybe kept me from giving this four stars -- although it superficially presents a \"real\" reality it does so through a scrim of contemporary \"reality hunger\" literary technique, replete with quotation and Rilke this time instead of the ubiquitous Bruno Schulz. The climactic scene is presented too as though she's workshopping a student story, questioning the heavy rain, suggesting something be added \"a beat\" before the action continues. And on the last page it snows without self-consciousness. Which I get, but which also doesn't exactly turn me on -- or maybe it's the same old story (and dramatic structure) filtered through the new anti-story \"technology of heartbreak\" convention as in Lorrie Moore's story about her baby's cancer (\"People Like That Are The Only People Here\") or Rick Moody's story \"Demonology\" about his sister's death or more recently Ben Lerner, Sheila Heti, Knausgaard, even Tao Lin and other literary autobiographical enthusiasts. It's 177 pages I read in a few hours thanks to short chapters and little jags no longer than two tweets. At times I wanted to compare it to Knausgaard's domestic artistic reality drama but I think it comes down to the lack of pressure Knausgaard puts on the details? In this, everything signifies or stresses, has tension to it, cleverness, poignancy. Knausgaard not so much -- he's about trees and sun and patterns, and comparatively, for a certified Art Monster (in Book Two) he comes off as enlightened, as someone naturally aware of the ambiguity of nature? In this, the narrator often comes off like a neurotic New York navel-gazing negatron, superficially and selfishly questing for answers from Buddhism, art, yoga, therapy, meds. It's of course wrong to treat this as \"110%\" autobiography, to dissolve the border between author and narrator, but, maybe other than the initial motherhood pages, the self-concern seemed self-enclosed in this, whereas Knausgaard's involutions somehow open up and let me in? Anyway, a very short, fast, airily formatted book available for $22.95 in hardcover from a publisher based in one of the most expensive areas of one of the most expensive cities in the world. Got it from the library for free. It's not due for three weeks. Maybe I'll read it 21 more times? Some striking quotations (a great Kafka aphorism I've never seen before: \"I write to close my eyes\") and little movements, plus the formatting and length make its completion in a sitting a possibility, which is a distinct readerly dealio at play compared to, say, reading something like Doctor Faustus, every chapter of which may have surpassed this one in word count. A \"good read\" but not much more than that for me, even if things are totally \"relatable\" for this married writer who's taught creative writing at the college level living in a northeastern city with a young daughter.

I want to review this book for a number of reasons, partly because it's so small and slight that I fear readers will ignore it. But, like Thomas Paine's Common Sense, its resemblance to a modest pamphlet belies the size of its punch.This book is an excellent character study and an example of what greatness can be achieved when an author trusts her reader and thus avoids the sin of overwriting. These days, many movies seem longer and sloppier and less craftily edited to me. Likewise, it seems like I'm reading more and more books where the author has misinterpreted \"show, don't tell\" to mean \"tell them everything, down to the most miniscule detail.\" For example, in another recent, divisive, quasi-experimental book about women's depression, Hausfrau, the author's determination and need to drive home her precious, weighty, portentous themes generated writing that, to my mind, seemed incredibly overwrought and pretentious and mechanical. To me, the prose read as though the author had hooked up an iPhone to protagonist Anna's brain and we were listening to Siri droning an interminable stream of repetitive thoughts in a dreadful computer-facilitated translation from another language. In contrast - Dept. Of Speculation is a very spare book whose concise prose attempts to capture the very human, fleeting thoughts of the troubled protagonist.Admittedly, I'm a sucker for books - from Virginia Woolf's to Zadie Smith's - that try to capture the imagistic, non-chronological way people actually think. So, without excruciatingly spelling it all out for us, author Jenny Offill helps us understand that Dept. Of Speculation's narrator-protagonist, \"the Wife,\" is a thwarted artist who has made sacrifices in her career in order to assume the demands of marriage and motherhood. It's implied that she's dealt with some past postnatal depression, and that although she desperately loves her young daughter, her depression lingers because the personal and vocational sacrifices she's made for her family's wellbeing have, unfortunately, failed to yield a secure and happy home as hoped. We get sketches of the family's trials, some as minute as a bedbug and some as monumental as an affair. We can infer that the protagonist may occasionally be a little bit of a difficult and anxious and self-loathing person - but no more than all of us. It's illustrated that the protagonist is intensely creative and intelligent, emotional and frustrated, and these themes are cleverly conveyed to us through the manner in which the Wife interweaves her personal musings and reflections with ideas from the scientific materials she's writing and editing. (Having abandoned her dreams of becoming an \"Art Monster,\" she's now paying the family bills by taking on technical writing jobs, ranging from fact-checker of Ranger Rick-type children's science curricula to ghostwriter of a memoir by an eccentric, space-exploration-obsessed, Branson-esque millionaire.) It's like these dry scientific facts with which she spends her days become both fodder and outlet for her repressed and agonized artistic mind: like the tasks of daily (mom, married, household) life itself, the facts are both incredibly trivial and yet weighted with universal import. It's a great delivery system to invite, and require, the reader's interpretive skills and show, rather than tell, a story - so much better than being repeatedly informed, a la Hausfrau, exactly what someone is thinking and feeling and just being forced to accept it wholesale.In other words, this is a TRUE character study. Because, it's insufficient, perhaps even cheating, but at very least disingenuous, to write a book that takes place entirely in the narrator/protagonist brain and call it a character study: That's just narrative point of view, not artistic or literary achievement. In a real character study, like this one, a reader is given tools and clues to develop her own earned understanding of a truly realistic, dynamic, evolving, and complex character. It's notable that Dept. of Speculation, using only one tiny little fraction of the page count of Hausfrau, provides a very rich sense of who the Wife is now, why she feels what she feels and does what she does, what she was like long ago, how and why she changed and ended up at this point, and in what direction she might go, or not go, next. (And I actually didn't get ANY of this successfully from Hausfrau, not even in the extra pages.) Plus, in Dept. of Speculation, I was still able to connect my own thoughts and dots -- they weren't just laid out for me, like railroad ties... -- and thus, it was an immensely more rewarding, challenging read for me, and one that left a pretty deep and lasting impression."}], "description": "Dept. of Speculation is a portrait of a marriage. It is also a beguiling rumination on the mysteries of intimacy, trust, faith, knowledge, and the condition of universal shipwreck that unites us all. Jenny Offill's heroine, referred to in these pages as simply \"the wife,\" once exchanged love letters with her husband postmarked Dept. of Speculation, their code name for all the uncertainty that inheres in life and in the strangely fluid confines of a long relationship. As they confront an array of common catastrophes - a colicky baby, a faltering marriage, stalled ambitions - the wife analyzes her predicament, invoking everything from Keats and Kafka to the thought experiments of the Stoics to the lessons of doomed Russian cosmonauts. She muses on the consuming, capacious experience of maternal love, and the near total destruction of the self that ensues from it as she confronts the friction between domestic life and the seductions and demands of art. With cool precision, in language that shimmers with rage and wit and fierce longing, Jenny Offill has crafted an exquisitely suspenseful love story that has the velocity of a train hurtling through the night at top speed. Exceptionally lean and compact, Dept. of Speculation is a novel to be devoured in a single sitting, though its bracing emotional insights and piercing meditations on despair and love will linger long after the last page.", "title": "Dept. of Speculation", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17402288-dept-of-speculation", "average": 3.73, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1367929545l/17402288.jpg", "reviews": 4274, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/33794.Jenny_Offill", "name": "Jenny Offill"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Contemporary", "Literary Fiction", "Adult Fiction", "Novels"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17402288-dept-of-speculation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20335765-dept-of-speculation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23653977-dept-of-speculation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18473997-dept-of-speculation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21384841-dept-of-speculation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17471114-sparky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/196092.17_Things_I_m_Not_Allowed_to_Do_Anymore", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10765595-11-experiments-that-failed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/262687.The_Friend_Who_Got_Away", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/604731.Last_Things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
