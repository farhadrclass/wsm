Anyway...I really, really, REALLY loved writing this book. I don't know what else to say about it, except I hope it makes you happy when you read it. But I guess that's how I feel about everything I write. If you're having a bad day, or week, or month, or whatever, maybe I can help make you smile, or laugh a little and forget about your troubles for a time or two. That's the goal! And it's coming in about 20 more days! I can't wait!! <3 <3 Mary"}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32829601-judy", "userReview": "I truly love all of Mary Frame's books! This one was not an exception to that statement. It starts as quite a few romance stories do, a \"fake\" dating situation that will become a course to real love. This story is a bit different though, in that Gwen does not fall for the fake boyfriend, Brent (who most of the world would see as the prize guy) but she falls for his brother Marc (who is the\" imperfect\" one, but \"perfect\" for her).I fell in love with Marc also. I could easily see that Gwen would pick him over his brother and I was cheering them on and hoping for a happy ending. Since it is a romance book, I felt assured that my wishes would come true.Mary Frame does an amazing job of character development in a somewhat short story. There are a few plots going on and all are handled very well. Her writing draws emotions from the reader; some happiness, some sadness and a lot of laughter. The story is very positive and uplifting and just the right amount of sexy.The next book in this series will be Brent's story. I have already picked the perfectly imperfect gal for him. I would like him to meet Scarlett (she is from Texas and she bakes delicious cupcakes and other deserts and is a bit naive) and fall head over heels in love with her! Fingers crossed :)I received the ARC of this book from the author for an honest review. That was very easy to do. Her books have brought me so much pleasure; I want to share my feelings about her writing to others."}, {"userName": "Becky Burciaga", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8232335-becky-burciaga", "userReview": "With the perfect twist to the fake relationship storyline, the story takes you into the machinations of the flawed mind...creating a snowball affect of adversity to the innocent. The originality with which the concept transpires draws your in, exposing the frailty of the mind and how we see ourselves. The characters' vulnerabilities and flaws, some internal some external, were created with the perfect blend of anguish and strength, written with such originality that the story is unique and fresh. This ARC book was complimentary, provided by the author. I am voluntarily providing my honest review."}, {"userName": "Mom's Guilty Pleasure", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16863042-mom-s-guilty-pleasure", "userReview": "\u201cSome scars are invisible.\u201dThis is book 4 in the Imperfect Series. It is my first Mary Frame read and I\u2019m kicking myself for not reading the books in order. I obviously don\u2019t know if I missed anything, but I feel in love with the characters and wish I had their backstories. I\u2019m looking forward to the next book in the series, but don\u2019t want to give away whose story it is! \u201cI\u2019ve been so good at pushing people away for the last year I didn\u2019t realize how much I was holding back who I am and what I\u2019ve been missing out on.\u201dThis book has everything you\u2019d want in a book! It\u2019s filled with heartfelt moments, self discovery, healing, regret, secrets, chemistry, sexy times, friendship, heartache, betrayal and hope. I was cheering for this couple and didn\u2019t know how it was going to pan out in the end...cliffhanger or conclusion."}, {"userName": "Nicole Burton", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26890770-nicole-burton", "userReview": "Another incredible book by Mary Frame! I received an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest review. Let me just start out saying I love The Imperfect Series. So much. And this book is an excellent addition to it! I loved Gwen and Marc and as always with Mary's books, there is a lot of smiles and laughs, cheesy, cute yet romantic moments, and wonderful writing! Not to mention the relatable characters, you can help but love! I loved the brief cameos of previous characters as well! I definitely recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Bernadette Cinkoske", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68862758-bernadette-cinkoske", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this story.

The characters are interesting and the way the romance unfolds is believable. I\u2019m not a fan of love triangles, but some how this works. There\u2019s def some very funny moments, one of my favourites was the \u201cmeme war\u201d - you have to read it to find out more!I received a copy of this book from the author in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9010166-alison", "userReview": "Damn, I wrote a long review and copied it (to be safe) but instead overwrote the whole thing with the letter C!So this is another winner from Mary Frame featuring Gwen, the sister of Gemma from Practically Imperfect. Gwen was a model but is now trying to make a living as a photographer. She got a big break when one of her photos appeared in a huge advertisement in Times Square, but then a nasty gossip magazine article accused her of having a meltdown and behaving erratically so the good work dried up until a chance picture at a restaurant lands her some good publicity and a chance to help out at a magazine shoot for New York's 20 sexiest people.Brent Crawford is the new tight end for the New York Sharks, he's young, rich, handsome and a nice person to boot. He and his older brother Marc turn up to the photoshoot and Brent is practically the only celebrity who appears to be genuinely pleasant. When Brent is falsely accused of assault his agent suggests he needs a wholesome girlfriend to refute the allegations, step forward Gwen.So far, nothing different right? The trouble is Gwen doesn't find Brent half as appealing as his serious older brother. Hell-o love triangle.This has all the hallmarks of a classic Mary Frame novel. It's quirky, clever, funny, it features strong female characters and endearing male characters. Loved it, loved it, loved it.Mary Frame is an auto-buy for me and has never disappointed."}, {"userName": "Diely", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64730686-diely", "userReview": "Wonderful characters and great love story.This has to be my favorite book from this author so far. And that's big, considering that \"Criminally Imperfect,\" the second book in this series (which I highly recommend) became one of my all-time favorite romance novels. I love a story with multi-dimensional, realistic characters. I'm so sick of \"Playboy billionaires,\" and \"Bad Boy types,\" and other cliche heroes. Marc, the hero in this story stole my heart, with his adorable mixture of strength and vulnerability. Just like his face scars protect him from being \"too good to be true,\" I loved how his (often funny) conflict with his impossible boss/father kept him human, balancing his extreme kindness. In spite of being a gorgeous former model with a load of self-confidence, Gwen the heroine was also humanized by the story of her \"breakdown\" and her history of emotional abuse. The secondary characters were also rich, and made me wish they were real so I could meet them.I also love when a story is a slow-boil romance instead of cringe-worthy Insta-Love (or Insta-lust). I deeply enjoyed the process of seeing the characters fall for each other gradually, as they deepened their connection in a very believable way. The best part was that, by the time they get together, you are already in love with them and rooting for their love.I've had quite a few disappointments lately, trying new authors. It is great to have a to-go author you know will never disappoint you. I can't wait for the next book on the series!"}, {"userName": "SS", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30934702-ss", "userReview": "4 1/2 starsThis is an adorable rom-com that sees two brothers fall for the same woman. It proved no chore to follow it to the end to learn which, if either, brother prevails. Of course, the character list goes beyond the central three and provides some interesting interaction. The central three:Gwen: she\u2019s adorable and lovable, talented, and someone I\u2019d like for a friend. Brent: a handsome professional football player who may have some hidden problems. Marc: Brent\u2019s older brother and an all around good guy who goes out of his way to help anyone who needs help. I fell in love with the characters almost immediately. How could I not? They\u2019re real and wonderful. And the story kept me reading eagerly, though for some reason I can\u2019t pinpoint, every now and then, my attention would wander. It was only occasionally, but I was aware when it happened. While this book ties up most of the plot points with a lovely HEA, there are enough questions left that there could be a sequel to follow. I certainly wouldn\u2019t be opposed to that. I received an ARC OF this book as a gift from the author. Opinions expressed in this review are my honest reactions to what I read, and were not influenced by the author\u2019s generosity."}, {"userName": "Joyce Black", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42549453-joyce-black", "userReview": "Excellent! I really enjoyed the witty banter and \"hearing\" the inner machinations of both the main female and male characters. Great characterizations. The main female character was a genuine, independent and all around lovely person. The main male character was loyal to a fault, kind and very thoughtful. Good story, romance, drama, sabotage and a menace. Quite enough elements to keep any reader entertained. I hope to read many more books by Ms. Frame!An absolute delight to read!I received an advance review copy of this novel and I am leaving an honest review."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3180699-terri", "userReview": "This was a great story! Brent and Marc had a great relationship, so it was really difficult for Marc to decide if he could give into his feelings for Gwen. And the last thing Gwen wanted to do was come between brothers. I enjoyed the dual point of view, which is always something I appreciate. There was humor, heartbreak, friendship, stalking, lust, and adoration in this very entertaining story. I'm looking forward to the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Amanda ", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5149059-amanda", "userReview": "Short review. Fourth book in the Imperfect series, each book keeps getting better and better. Not your typical fake relationship love story. It has a fun twist and three main characters Gwen, Marc and his brother Brent that you can't help but like even love. This book like all in the series is a standalone but characters from the previous books do make appearances. I can't wait for Brent's book and see who he falls in love with."}, {"userName": "Deb Le", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58869663-deb-le", "userReview": "This is the first book by Mary Frame that I've had the pleasure to read, but it won't the be the last. this one was funny and sweet with endearing characters who just had me crossing my fingers right until the end for a HEA.

I really enjoyed all of the characters and how their stories played out (I can\u2019t wait for Brent\u2019s book!) I think my favorite part was how Gwen was able to see past Marc\u2019s scars and appreciate him for homemaker and all he does for the people around him. Book characters are typically flawless specimens so it was refreshing to have a character with physical flaws. This book can definitely be read as a stand-alone but we do get to see the characters from the previous books in the series. I really enjoyed getting to see them again as I\u2019ve thoroughly enjoyed each book in this series. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a light refreshing read. The characters are relatable and enjoyable. I look forward to the next installment in this series!"}], "description": "You\u2019ve heard this story a thousand times.Boy meets girl.Boy and girl have a fake relationship.Then they actually fall in love.This is not one of those stories.It should be.
