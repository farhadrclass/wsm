It was a good read, and kept my interest. I'm not sure that I enjoyed it that much. A very interesting concept about creatures that take over the body of a person who is absolutely terrified on Sorry Night, which is the night of the Winter Solstice. I heard about this book, and read some positive reviews, and decided to go for it. I have no regrets that I did read it, but I have to say that there were things I could have liked better about this book. The opening was excellent, really unnerving me. I started this book right before bedtime, and I had to read a little bit of a romance book before I turned off the light and went to sleep. It sets the reader up to know this wouldn't be an especially gentle horror story.When I asked myself what didn't quite ring true to me about this story, I am encouraged to go and analyze it. I didn't dislike the main characters. Reggie was a sympathetic protagonist. She's been forced to grow up too fast, coerced/encouraged by her father to take the role of her mother, who left the family and has not returned. She's only fifteen and she wants to do the normal things that a fifteen year old does, but she is pretty much forced to raise her younger brother, Henry, who is eight, since her father works a demanding construction contracting job (and is emotionally withdrawn). Going into the story, you feel her longing to be 'normal' and to not have the weight of the world on her shoulders. Mixed in is some resentment towards her younger brother, who has gotten more clingy, instead of more independent. This sets the stage for what will happen in this sibling relationship.Reggie works in a small bookstore that caters towards the horror/gothic tastes. She unpacks a box of books and finds a diary-looking book in the box called The Devouring, which she decides to read, with her best friend Aaron on Sorry Night. She and Aaron expose themselves to their individual worst phobias and chant the mysterious poem at the beginning of the journal. This somehow seems to activate the vour to take her brother's soul, for he is the most frightened in the house. Reggie puts him to bed and he sits in the dark, afraid out of his mind, easy prey for this evil being.From there this story turns into a 'Bad Seed' kind of narrative, as Henry becomes increasingly not like himself. He becomes cruel and violent, commiting acts that are increasingly disturbing. Reggie doesn't put two and two together at first, which I found annoying. Clearly her brother is not acting normal, and his skin becomes very cold to the touch. It takes too long for her to get a clue, but I was glad that she is scolded by her boss at the bookstore, Eben, for diddling around with this journal, and she didn't know what she was doing.Reggie has to face her worst fears and delve into the fearscape where her brother's consciousness has been entrapped, in order to get him back and to save him from the Vours. They are after her as well. They thrive on fear, and Reggie has walked a tightrope of being brave (she's a major horror buff) and fighting her real-life fears. I thought this was a good message about not letting your fears control you, and facing the truth instead of avoiding the acceptance of things that you don't want to face and you know you cannot change.I liked Reggie's buddy, Aaron, who is a bit of a geek, and who shares her love of horror movies, but also has a fascination with serial killers. He is a true friend to her the whole time, and I got the impression he might have a crush on Reggie, although she's fixated on footballer player and popular kid, Quinn. Aaron is in for the long haul, facing danger and his devastating fear of drowning, to help Reggie get her brother's soul back and to vanquish the vour that is controlling his body.What I didn't particularly care for in this story:  I felt that Reggie and Henry's dad was too one-dimensional. He seemed like a plot point, only coming around to scold Reggie for not doing enough, and to treat Reggie badly when he starts to believe the Un-Henry's lies. He didn't seem all that real to me, and wasn't that loving. Okay, I can acknowledge that he was in a bad place, having lost his wife, and trying to raise his kids without her. But there wasn't enough signs of his love for his kids shining through. Also I wished there was more closure about their mom disappearing. You don't really get too much information, other than she's gone, and Reggie secretly wished she was dead, rather than face that her mom ran out on her. I would like to understand what was motivating this flight. We know that Reggie was close to her mom, and they had girl talk session in the bathroom when she cut Reggie's hair. That's why I didn't understand what prompted her to leave, and there didn't seem to be any signs that she was fed up, either. The book doesn't really give enough information on this to feel like there's a whole story there, and so I am forced to see the mother as yet another poorly-fleshed out character. I thought the book was a tad too gruesome. There are some pretty long, detailed scenes describing acts of cruelty or the aftermath that I am not sure how appropriate they would be for a younger audience. I had some issues with them, and I'm 36 years old. I think the author is targeting the young adult audience who loves slasher movies, and these teens wouldn't have a problem with these scenes. I can't fault him on that, but it didn't seem to fit in with the somewhat gothic vours concept. It seemed to go in a 180 degree direction, in fact. The organic nature of the vours came out of left field, leaving me with more questions. I wasn't quite expecting that. I'm wondering how these pieces fit together, in fact. There is a sequel to this book, but I'm not sure how motivated I am to read it, at this point. I might pick it up later on to get some closure. However, I can't say I was blown away by this story, and felt motivated to commit myself to this series. However, I freely admit it was a great book to read on Halloween, and very suspenseful. I think Mr. Holt is a very good writer, and has a talent in horror. But unfortunately, this book doesn't get out of B grade territory for me because of the lack of depth with the parents, and also with Henry (I couldn't feel too much for them). Also, there were some parts where Henry is treated rather brutally by his sister and Aaron (because of the vour inside him) that made me squirm. It felt like child abuse (irrational of me, but there you have it). It just needed a little more depth for me to feel more strongly about it. For a basic horror book for teens that doesn't require much emotional commitment or analysis, this is a good one. I just like a little more with my reading."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "YA Horror isn't in the same league with Adult Horror, so I'm not going to try and compare apples to carpet cleaner. There's no point.This was a really good teen horror story. I wish I had been able to read it when I was younger, because I'm sure it would have been one of my favorites.The breakdown of the story is that a girl and her best friend (who happen to love all things scary), get their hands on an old journal that they believe to be someone's idea of a joke. Maybe the first draft of a novel they were writing. According to this book there are evil spirits who can enter and take over your body one night a year, if you are frightened enough. So in the tradition of Bloody Mary, they call the spirits up as a joke. Except they aren't scared. Unfortunately, the girl's little brother is in the house...and he is terrified.To adults who have been weaned on Stephen King, there is nothing here that they probably haven't seen a million times before. But to those new to the genre? Brrrrrr. Nothing says creepy like a possessed kid. Especially one that you love.This is a trilogy, so the ending has a conclusion, but you know nothing is really over for those poor kids.Good stuff. It's well written, and I was chewing my nails even though I guessed the probable outcome. I'd recommend it for teens looking for a spooky read, or adults looking for Horror-Lite."}, {"userName": "Spider the Doof Warrior", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2348494-spider-the-doof-warrior", "userReview": "Normally I do not dig horror books.This is not totally true, I went through a brief John Saul phase in Jr. High school.

I\u2019ve been afraid of the dark for as long as I can remember, yes, I am still afraid of the dark. I do not like scary movies, I happened to watch It, the movie based on the novel of the same title by Steven King, when I was in elementary school, I don\u2019t think I slept for weeks, and I still haven\u2019t been able to watch the movie again. So, when I grabbed a copy of the Devouring by Simon Holt and read the synopsis, I have to admit I was a little scared to read it!And it was scary/freaky/suspenseful! But besides that it was a great novel! Yes, me scardy girl, enjoyed reading a \u201chorror\u201d novel. I can\u2019t really compare it to any other novels of that nature, but I can say that I thought the plot was wonderfully crafted. The whole concept of the Vours was masterful! I hope I don\u2019t run in to any of those things on Sorry Night.I also appreciated the fact that the novel kept the gruesome elements to a minimum.

This book is amazing. It got me hanging in every word and the description was so vivid that got me terrified with every nightmare.The vours are simply terrifying things that can get you if you get scary enough. They take your body and send your soul to a terrible place.The worse part is that nobody knows that you are missing because your body is still there, but not your soul.I get goose bumps just thinking about it.The best scary book ever!!!!!The Plot -  Bloody fantastic. Its was what first got my attention (well, the second actually, the first was this amazing cover LoL) and it got me hooked to it till the cliffhanging end. I can\u2019t say enough of how I enjoy its twists and totally new monsters that creeps the shadows looking for worm bodies to take over. I can only imagine what twist mind would come up with such monsters. It\u2019s got to be wonderfully twisted LoL The Characters -  Reggie is this addicted to scary stories and loves to feel the adrenaline that invades the body the minute you get scared out of your skin. She is brave, way too brave for her own good. Her brother is the one I related the most, I guess it\u2019s because you have the same unreasonable fear of clowns LoL. Sorry, but, the person that said that they were funny have a mind more twisted then mine. And mine mind is way twisted, believe me.The Writing - Is in third person (not much my taste) but it\u2019s written in a way that I can still see trough Reggie\u2019s eyes. I simply love the way that the writer describes the sounds and the fear and I could almost feel the cold bit my skin in the snow and listen to the baby\u2019s sound in the silent ,,well,, you\u2019ve got the idea. Describes things very well without being boring.Considerations - The scary books never really got my attention and the books I\u2019ve read in the past was from Stephen king and I really like it, but never give much chance for this genre of literature,, until The Devouring. This book made me fall in love, twisted and creepy love. LoLJust one thing that I think is a miss,, so romance, no kissing, no noting\u2026. I think it could had been more of that in it. I\u2019m a romantic after all LoLThis is me waiting to read the next book in the series:"}, {"userName": "Rachael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1028829-rachael", "userReview": "Reggie is a horror fan; she figures reading all those scary books and watching all those scary movies is a sort of preparation for the real thing, real fear. But for Reggie, real fear is just arachnophobia for example, something real she can name. So when she stumbles upon a mysterious journal detailing the horrors of certain demonic beings called Vours that take over human bodies, she dismisses it as a work of fiction. But she can\u2019t deny the strange coincidence of her little brother Henry acting very strangely\u2014and after Sorry Night, the only time that Vours can invade bodies. And when Henry\u2019s behavior becomes more erratic and destructive, Reggie realizes that she had no idea what real fear was before\u2014because now, she\u2019s living it.The Devouring is a suspenseful paranormal novel with elements of horror. Its strongest point is by far its unique plot, which I found exciting, original, and unpredictable with its combination of mystery, familiar problems, and all-encompassing fear. The characters, on the other hand, are a bit hard to connect with, even Reggie with her fierce determination. She was a little too easily blinded by cute popular boys and seemed to be spooked easily despite her claims to have conquered her fears. Another problem I have was that I often felt removed from the story despite vivid and horrifying details because it felt so unreal. Part of this is due to how fast paced The Devouring is; Reggie had to adapt, almost too quickly sometimes it seemed, to each new situation. I am a little disappointed, because thought The Devouring would\u2019ve been better, but it is still an interesting read with a scientific twist to fear.Fans of Peeps and The Midnighters trilogy, both by Scott Westerfeld, and The Summoning by Kelley Armstrong will likely enjoy this intriguing read.reposted from http://thebookmuncher.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1594906-kim", "userReview": "3.5 stars.

She reads them compulsively--she even works in a horror book store. Sometimes, she thinks she might be reading them to distract her from the truly scary things in her life--like the fact that her mom ran out on them, and they haven't heard from her in over a year, or the fact that her father is more and more distant every day. Or the fact that she is singlehandedly raising her little brother, Henry.But mostly, Reggie just reads horror because she loves it. And when she finds an old journal called The Devouring, she brings it home and reads it. It tells of creatures called Vours that can attack people through their fears, and then inhabit their bodies. They come into our world on Sorry Night, the eve of the winter solstice.Naturally, Reggie and her best friend Aaron can't resist summoning the Vours on Sorry Night. But they aren't the ones who are possessed--instead, Reggie's little brother Henry starts acting stranger and stranger, until Reggie realizes that he's not Henry anymore--he's something older and darker. Something terrifying.To save her brother, Reggie will have to face her deepest fears.The writing in this book is not strong, and it nearly lost me with its clunkiness in the first couple of chapters. It felt a little cliche and tired, and I could predict exactly what would happen.But then the horror starts, and damned if this book isn't scary. It's truly, terrifyingly scary. At one point, I almost had to stop reading and take a breath.So it's not a work of great literature. What it is is a top notch teen horror novel.

In fact, it\u2019s so good that I picked it up off the shelf in the store and decided I was going to buy it even before I looked at the blurb. Apart from being visually stimulating, it manages to capture the real essence of the story without giving too much away.The blurb is pretty enticing as well. Check this out:Vours:Evil, demonic beings that inhabit human bodies on Sorry Night, the darkest hours of the winter solstice.This isn\u2019t how the horror ended for us \u2013This is how it began.When Reggie reads about the Vours in a mysterious old journal, she assumes they are just the musings of an anonymous lunatic. But when her little brother, Henry, begins to act strangely, it\u2019s clear that these creatures exist beyond a madwoman\u2019s imagination, and Reggie finds out what happens when fears come to life. To save the people she loves, Reggie must learn to survive in a world of nightmares. Can she devour her own fears before they devour her?The Devouring is an engrossing tale of terror that will have you wondering: what if your worst fears became your living nightmare?Sounds awesome, right? Well, I thought so anyway. Unfortunately, now that I\u2019ve finished reading it, I\u2019m not quite sure what to think. Firstly, let me just say that I didn\u2019t think it was bad. Not at all. But there is just something about it that isn\u2019t sitting right with me.The characters are all likable enough, yet they don\u2019t seem individual enough, there is not a whole lot that separate them from each other in my mind. For me to consider a book astonishing, the characters really need to jump off the page and present themselves as independent, unique individuals. That doesn\u2019t really happen for me with The Devouring. However, I\u2019m not prepared to say that I don\u2019t like the characters, because I do. Or maybe it\u2019s just that there isn\u2019t anything exceptionally unlikable about them, I can\u2019t quite tell. Either way, they didn\u2019t leave a huge impression.Everything happens pretty fast, too. There isn\u2019t a whole lot of build up, which for some, might be a good thing. I, however, am a big fan of the build up. I love anticipation and surprise. Although it\u2019s not predictable, per se, The Devouring didn\u2019t have me sitting on the edge of my seat. Yet, at the same time, I didn\u2019t want to put it down.Can you see what I\u2019m saying here? It wasn\u2019t bad, not by a long shot, but it wasn\u2019t outstanding either, you know? I do think that it would make a really awesome film, however. Visually, I think it would be a real creeper. But as words, well, it falls a little short of creepy.Give it a go.

I was sucked in int he deep abyss of Reggie's fears. This tale is dark and deep, chilling me to the bone. A gripping tale of overcoming your deepest darkest fears turning them in on themselves.Reggie starts off as a weaker character growing stronger and more assertive through her love and devotion for her little brother. She begins the novel with a theory that proves useful later: she immerses herself in horror and fright through movies and literature, knowing that facing your fears, makes you stronger. Her skittish best friend Aaron on the other hand has a hard time overcoming that which scares him the most. His loyalty proves to be his best defense against the frightful beings that overtake and consume their fears. Those monstrous things that can take full control of their bodies, gaining power and strength through their fright and terror.The story is race for control. Control of the body and mind that the Vours (those monstrous beings that feed on nightmares) are so eager to keep and protect, no matter the cost. Life or death. It is a high speed nightmare of a story with the most hidden, darkest and most frightful nightmares one can imagine. Skin crawling imagery full of ghoulish tableau of nightmarish after nightmarish scenarios. So tormenting that I had to read it during the day.The novel grips you and I was so engrossed in this ghoulish and utterly frightful tale.Some characters liek Reggie are well fleshed out, full of life. Others like Eben and Aaron left me wanting more. I was left in the dark not knowing much about the characters themselves, leaving them mere props in Reggie's quest to save her brother. Henry, Reggie's brother, was by far the creepiest little kid I have ever read about. He was so eerily bewitching and haunting at the same time. I wanted to read more of his torment and more of the deep, dark, secret Vour.The story was an intrigue and a nightmare. A fast paced race into nightmares and fears, with life and death walking a thin line.Now some creepy quotes:\"The scraping noise of a hatchet blade across glass sent her racing deeper into the maze. This time no sawdust signaled the way out. She reached one dead end after another, surrounded by even more freakish reflections: her father's head severed on a platter with apple in his mouth, her mother rocking a demon infant...\" (p186)AND\"Mom raised the scissors high. They flashed in the light like a silver-winged bird, and then plunged them into her own wrist. She offered her arm to Reggie like a bloody sacrifice.\"I give this book a 88/100 B+Characters-16Plot- 19Writing-17Originality-18Re-Readability- 18"}, {"userName": "Jessica Saylor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3589919-jessica-saylor", "userReview": "Quick Overview: With an entrancing plot but slightly underdeveloped characters, The Devouring was a fun read that left a lot of room for a great series. This book was nothing like I expected it to be. Looking back, I have no idea why I didn't pick this book up sooner. It has been sitting on my shelves for probably about a year, and I just ran my hand across it without taking a second look every time. If you are having the same problem, don't hesitate. This book is worth the read. The Devouring has such an exciting plot. One of my favorite things about it, was the creepy factor. It takes a lot for a book to creep me out, but the voices and thoughts that Holt put into my head had me shivering and leaving on a night light (well, I have one anyways, but I was particularly grateful for it these last few nights). I felt that the characters were a little underdeveloped. I couldn't tell you much about the main character except that she is into cute boys and likes anything to do with horror. I could tell you even less about other main characters Eden and Aaron. The only character that really did it for me was Henry, and that could just be because I have a soft spot for cute little boys. They remind me of my nephew so I am constantly on their side in books.The Devouring was a great series beginning. There wasn't much particularly special about the novel itself, it wasn't absolutely amazing and it wasn't bad at all either. It was just a fun read that left a lot of room for a great series. Parental Suggestion: Though the eerie setting and nightmarish themes in The Devouring are pretty stinking creepy, there is nothing in this book that is inappropriate for teenagers 13 and older. First Line: \"On sorry night, just a few nights before Christmas, you have to snuff the lamps, douse the flames in the fireplace, and spend the night in the cold and dark.\"-Page OnePlot: 19/20Characters: 18/20Creativity: 18/20Writing: 16/20Ending: 7/10Cover: 8/10=86/100, B"}, {"userName": "Sensitivemuse", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2434215-sensitivemuse", "userReview": "This book was so good I wanted to stay up at night to finish it. The prologue was so good and gripping that I had to continue reading it to see what would happen. The book had all the makings to become a horror movie itself. The writing was great and an easy read. It had very well written descriptions of horror scenes which is enough to put the reader on edge. Some parts were so well written I found myself reacting to it out loud while reading. Fear is the main theme here, and Reggie has a giant phobia of spiders. Naturally, there are many scenes which include spiders. I'm rather scared of spiders myself and I could just feel my skin crawl as I read the parts where Reggie is constantly terrorized by them. As said before, the horror scenes are excellent and picturing them isn't so hard. It brings the reader right into the book as if one was beside Reggie herself. I like Reggie. She's the typical horror heroine you find in horror movies. Strong, attempting to live life as normal as possible, until the Vours come in and turn her life upside down. Her friend Aaron is also, your typical side kick in a horror movie who is the brains and helps Reggie get to the bottom of understand and figuring out the Vours. Then there's Eben, who's the mysterious good guy but with a horrible secret. However, like any horror movie, it doesn't stop there. There is a second book out (called Soulstice) which I am definitely getting once I have the chance to. The Devouring is definitely worth reading if you feel like reading something creepy and terrifying. Yet, there are still questions to be answered. There is blood and gore in the book. So those that aren't partial to it should avoid this book. However those that want a scare should definitely pick this up. Overall, one of my favorite reads of this year. I am glad I picked this book up. I was pleasantly scared."}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1969199-natalie", "userReview": "\u201cWhen dark creeps in and eats the light, bury your fears on Sorry Night.

Your body\u2019s here, but not your soul\u2026\u201dReggie has always been a fan of the gothic, the supernatural, the horrific. One day, while working at the local bookstore, she comes across a book called The Devouring and, thinking it\u2019s just another horror novel, takes it home. As Reggie and her best friend, Aaron, peruse the book, they discover the world of the Vours, demonic creatures who possess humans by preying off of fear.For Reggie and Aaron, it\u2019s all just fun and games, until Reggie\u2019s little brother, Henry, starts exhibiting strange behavior. Then, bad things start happening. Henry\u2019s babysitter turns up dead, and Reggie finds Henry\u2019s pet hamster in the toilet with a broken neck. Henry begins lying to their father, getting Reggie in trouble for things she didn\u2019t do. When Reggie starts experiencing fear-induced hallucinations, she begins to wonder if the Vours really are just storybook monsters after all.The Devouring is a compelling young adult thriller that focuses on the element of fear. Even though the Vours are fictional beings, I found it easy to relate to the fear described in the book, mainly because fear is a natural reaction that all of us, as humans, experience at one time or another. In addition, The Devouring doesn\u2019t just focus on supernatural issues, but normal, teenage problems that the characters face as well. The book was very well-written and suspenseful, and kept me turning pages the entire time. Be warned though, it does end with a cliffhanger, leading into Holt\u2019s second book in the series, The Soulstice."}, {"userName": "Alexandra", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4538194-alexandra", "userReview": "This is one of those books that I had heard so many awesome things about, bought at a Borders closing sale, and then left to sit on my bookshelf for months and months. Why did I do that?! It was SO good! The Devouring is a YA horror novel, but it's actually really creepy and well written. I like the way Simon Holt's mind works. From the very first page, I was sucked right into this story. The School Library Journal compares Simon Holt to R.L. Stine which I guess I can see, but The Devouring is much more advanced than a Goosebumps book, I'll tell you that right now. And much more detailed. Don't get me wrong, I used to love Goosebumps books. But when I was in 2nd and 3rd grade. I wouldn't want to read them now. So I wouldn't want the comparison to R.L. Stine to deter older readers from this book, because The Devouring is definitely more substantial. It takes place in a tiny town called Cutter's Wedge, during the wintertime. That's something that I found really cool about this book because it is very Halloween-y (a.k.a appropriate to read during the Halloween season) but it also takes place during the Winter Solstice and Christmas so it would also be a fun read to pick up in December. Very versatile ;)The Devouring also has a really good message to it, which is essentially to face your fear and not let it get the best of you & if you can look what scares you in the eye and not back down or let it overcome you, then you will come out on top, which I really liked. Great read :D"}, {"userName": "Nely", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1440151-nely", "userReview": "I really can't say I am a fan of things scary. I avoid scary movies like the plague. To be quite honest, I always tell the hubs \"if we are ever caught in a scary movie-type scenario, run with the kids, I'm going to be the one who trips and falls and gets keeeled by the monster\".With that said, The Devouring, was all that and a bag of chips for me. I was scared, I was excited, I was at the edge-of-my-seat, I was taken in from the start and spit out at the end... and then I couldn't stop thinking about it. There were plenty of parts that gave me goosebumps and had me looking for a bright, sunny spot to read it in.I really liked Reggie. I love her go get 'em attitude. She had no fears when it came to standing up for those she loves. I also loved her relationship with her BFF and sidekick, Aaron. Hopefully a love interest will spark between the two in the next book (keeping fingers crossed).I will forewarn though, this is not for the faint of heart. There were some instances that were pretty gruesome - I didn't think it was overkill, but I can see where some might. This is definitely geared for the older teen - Mr. Holt's writing is simple, to the point, and there is some mild violence with hardly any bad language. I personally think it's a great read for lovers of horror / slasher movies no matter the age. It really was deliciously creepy."}, {"userName": "Mariah Hansen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12743373-mariah-hansen", "userReview": "This book is very spooky.

The 2nd book \"Soulstice\" is coming out in September '09. I wasn't able to find how many books are planned for this series so if anyone knows; speak up!Reggie and Aaron are horror fanatics. Reggie finds an old journal at the horror bookstore she works at. The journal talks about Vours, evil entities that can take over your soul during winter soulstice. The Vours can only enter the minds of people who are truly afraid. In an effort to scare themselves silly Reggie and Aaron try to tempt the Vours to take over them by daring each other to face their worst fears on Winter Solstice. They are disappointed that nothing happens but Reggie's little brother is not so lucky; he has been a scared little boy since their mother left and the Vours find him easy pickings.In other book reviews I have mentioned that I don't like scary things; be they books, movies, or haunted houses. Well for the other woosies like me out there, beware, this is a scary book. For those who revel in all things horror; you will be delighted. The horror aspect in this book is more around the magical/psychological type of horror. Although fans of classic horror get their due too; with the appearance of an ax wielding clown, refreshements laid out in open rib cages, and people buried alive. Also if you have any type of fear of spiders I would steer clear of this book.The book itself was very well written. The characters were likeable and engaging. The idea of the people you love and trust becoming evil incarnate overnight is very Exorcist; and totally creeped me out. I really liked Reggie and Eben, the bookstore owner. I felt for all of the characters. The book was fast-paced and I couldn't put it down. This is a book that focuses less on high-school life and more on the unusual events in Reggie's life; which I enjoyed. If you really enjoy all the gossiping and angsting that is included in some young adult books like this you might be disappointed.There was some swearing in the book, but it was pretty mild. I was also surprised that the book was very scary without being excessively gorey. The story was a good one and was tightly put together and well thought out. This book works well as a stand alone book; although Eben mentions that the Vours are just the tip of the evil iceberg.So, the million dollar question is will I read Soulstice when it comes out? I am tempted to; The Devouring is a fascinating book and a quick and engaging read. Do I want to have to sleep with the lights on for another night and suffer nightmares for a couple nights? No, not really. I found Laura Faria Stolarz's \"Blue is for Nightmare's\" to also be too scary for me. So if you loved \"Blue is for Nightmares\" you will probably love this book. I actually thought the Devouring was much more creative and interesting than \"Blue is for Nightmares\".As a great young adult horror book I think this book is a winner. For me personally it is just too darn scary."}, {"userName": "Gemma", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2734630-gemma", "userReview": "Oh. My. Jellybeans.This book was kind of amazing. I'm not sure what I was expecting; all I knew was that I didn't think the Devouring would or could possibly be as good as it was. At risk of getting gushy here (something I try to avoid), the Devouring was unlike any other book I've read for a while. It combined a blend of good, strong, likeable characters with new, interesting premise with well executed storyline. It's a paranormal book, yes, but there's nothing even remotely Twilight about it.It's a little bit of a horror story. I say a little bit because, though it is rather creepy, it's not exactly horrifying. I'm not complaining about that; I don't actually do horror stories. I find them horrifying. But this one had that scary vibe to it, which increased the enjoyability levels and also kept me on the edge of my seat turning pages. The Devouring focuses on Vours, creatures that devour souls and then inhabit the body that\u2019s left behind. I guess they're kind of like demons (or dementors). At the beginning of the book, Regina (but she's mostly called Reggie)'s little brother becomes a Vour. It's sort of like becoming a Changeling in faery books. She knows something is wrong, but she's not certain. It all traces back to this journal she found explaining the whole thing.So, naturally, she tries to figure it all out, leading to, you know, the storyline and... stuff. It's hard to explain without spoiling it. But it was all excellent.Reggie was pretty cool. She was strong, you could tell from her narrative. And even though she was written by a guy, she didn't seem terribly unrealistic. I liked her. I also liked her friend, Aaron. He was interesting, sometimes said funny things and kept things moving. At first, I kinda thought he was gay (because they were talking about his jaunty fedora, and usually whenever there's note of a male character's flamboyant fashion taste, it means he's gay), but now, at the end of the book, I hope he isn't, because that means there will never be any romance in the story (which won't necessarily bother me, but he and Reggie would make a good couple).The author actually established his characters, which is always a good thing. I didn't get the feeling that they were plot devices laid out so the author could get to the horror story he wanted his book to be. They seemed like real people, and I liked them. Also, this book is short, but a lot happens. No words are wasted describing banal things that have no importance to the plot.I will definitely be reading the sequels."}], "description": "The Vours: Evil, demonic beings that inhabit human bodies on Sorry Night, the darkest hours of the winter solstice.When Reggie reads about the Vours in a mysterious old journal, she assumes they are just the musings of an anonymous lunatic.
