It\u2019s kind of blank spot on the map for many of us, but it consists of Ethiopia, Somalia, Eritrea and Djibouti. The story is set in the 1970\u2019s. A young boy grows up in a world of women \u2013 his father has been killed in the endless territorial disputes of this area especially the on-going feud over Ogaden, a region disputed by Somalia and Ethiopia. His mother died at his birth, so he was adopted by the childless midwife. In this world of women he even comes to believe that he has menstruated. This is referred to more than a dozen times in the novel to the point where it seems overdone. The main character grows up as a bright, scholarly \u201clittle adult\u201d who looks down on the games and silliness of other kids his age. He is in love with his schooling and his wall maps, trying to figure out his place in the world literally and figuratively. This is a diverse regions with many peoples. He grows up in a tiny village in a Somali-speaking world, but his adoptive mother is Oromo, from Ethiopia and she speaks Amharic (not Aramaic). This ethnic difference is critical because later in the story she is accused of treason by the Somalis and the boy has to decide if he believes this or not and deal with his feelings. The young boy ends up being quasi-adopted by a well-off uncle and his wife in the big city of Mogadishu. In the transition from tiny village to big city, a whole new world opens up to him. Contrary to stereotypes of the Muslim world, the wife is very modern and drives to work as a college professor while her husband stays home to cook and keep house. The boy loves his country and wants to go to war to defend it and to get his territory back. His aunt and uncle want him to pursue his education and forget about these endless, futile territorial wars. So a big theme is the pen vs. the sword. I found this to be a so-so read as a novel but its main value is in the local color of a part of the world that few novels emerge from. (Another that comes to mind is Paradise by Abdulrazak Gurnah.)"}, {"userName": "Hadrian", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian", "userReview": "Conflicted feelings about this one. I appreciate the poetic force of Farah's prose style, but too much of the book is squandered. Farah loves writing about the symbolism of dreams, giving children implausibly deep questions, and stirring up the narrative by moving between first, second, and third person for the same characters.For the purposes of Goodreads, I give it three stars as a placeholder, but Farah had moments of true greatness."}, {"userName": "\u0637\u064e\u064a\u0652\u0641", "userReviewDate": "May 15,

I feel the book completely turns around when Askar arrives in Mogadishu and one meets with Hilaal and Salaado. They are marvelous! This is what I thought before this point: I wanted to like this book...... but I don't. I always check Kirkus Reviews because usually they do not praise a book or an author unless it is really good. In their review of Maps, shown on the Barnes and Noble site,they say it is \"One of the best novels out of Africa in some time.\" I am very disappointed, both in the book and in the B&N review. I have not finished the book yet; I am about half way through. I will force myself to finish the book. I do not like the narrative. I do not think it gives insight of Somalian life. Please read Jess' review below. I agree with every sentence of her review! It seems silly to just repeat what she has said, but read her review and believe it. If I search for something good to say about Maps it would be that sometimes Farah does express intriguing thoughts, such as: \"Annoy a child and you will discover the adult in him. Please an adult with gifts and the child therein re-emerges.\" Think about it, this is true! But on the whole this book is tedious, repetitive and boring. Buying this book was a mistake. If when I finish the book my opinion has changed I will let you know.Well my opinion has changed! I love Farah's writing, and maybe all that I disliked before makes me appreciate the writing now even more. The book does give insights into Somalian life and the ethnic problems at the root of the Ethiopian and Somalian conflict. It also sheds light on other African conflicts. Still reading ......So in conclusion I would have to say that I do like Farah's writing. I personally do not like books that only express the dark side of life because all life includes sparkles of happiness and humor. Sometimes the sparkles are few and far between, but they are there. A book that dispenses with all sparkles is not true to life and is oh so difficult to read! This book does balance the despair and hopelessnes in Misra's life with hope and understanding and purpose, seen in the lives of Hilaal and Salaado. Askar is in the middle, confused and not knowing which way to be drawn. It is he who must define where he stands, and thus who he is. This book is not easy reading, but well worth the effort. It is not only about African ethnic differences and their implications but also about the balance between body versus mind and fate versus our ability to control our lives. Hilaal and Salaado did not have an easy life, but they chose to direct their own lives and made a point of seeing life's sparkle. They remained compassionate and understanding of others and Misra."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4803616-eric", "userReview": "Fantastic coming-of age story. For a culture as mysterious as that of the Somali, this book gives an interesting insight into the people and the wars that they fought, both to liberate themselves and to get to know who they truly are. While the switch in points of view was confusing, it became easier to follow with time. The worldview of Askar, the main character, keeps changing as he grows older, and as the people that surround him react to their worlds, they give him an insight into human nature, and he learns what his place in this world is.First Nurudding Farah book I am reading. Definitely not the last."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2031662-peter", "userReview": "Although this story jumps around in time from the very beginning, and sometimes steps out of time altogether in dream sequences, it also progresses forward steadily as the problem of the identity of Askar moves from mostly considerations of how the child Askar is defined by and against his adoptive mother Misra, to how those considerations become politicized as we come to understand that Misra is ethnically Ethiopian and Askar Somalian. But the initial definitions of child against mother, boy/man against woman never go away. They are mixed in with the problem of political identities, as Askar comes to understand that he is Somalian, and to consider what that means. But the categories Ethiopian/Somalian are never quite stable either; they are discussed and complicated throughout the book, and the discussion of maps itself brings in further considerations of the relationship between Somalia and Africa as a whole, and between colonizers and colonized. The book's narration, told in third, first and second person, helps create the sense throughout of the instability and plurality of identity. But this discussion of identity formation is never purely abstract, this is all set in a defined place and time, in the setting, to start with, of a region fought over by Ethiopians and Somalians, with Soviet intervention. The book raises possibilities, both uplifting and disturbing--life is sacrifice and the drinking of enemy blood, life is giving and love--but doesn't offer any clear resolutions. It's not always easy to follow. It's brilliant."}, {"userName": "Chris Blocker", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/318724-chris-blocker", "userReview": "One almost needs a map to make sense of this novel. It's not that the story is convoluted; it's more the way the story is told. At its core, Maps is exquisitely written with a story that is perhaps a bit too drawn out, but is interesting nonetheless. The language Farah uses to craft this story is phenomenal. There is beauty in the simple construction of many sentences, philosophy in the placing of others. If Maps is any indication, Farah is a very talented writer with a particular knack for the English language (Farah writes in English despite it not being his first language).For a reader such as myself, I wonder if Farah isn't too clever. I have a feeling this book offered more profound statements than I was able to take away from it. Particularly, what was the reason behind all the shifts in Maps? There are shifts in time, place, reality, and, most distracting, in point-of-view. Farah heavily utilizes first, second, and third person in Maps, switching at the end of nearly every chapter. Also, there seem to be questions of gender and gender identity at the heart of the novel, but I never spent enough time on the text to decipher what message I was supposed to walk away with.I liked Maps sufficiently, but Farah isn't the kind of author I'd run to again. Linguistically, he reminds me of a more philosophical, more poetic Aleksandar Hemon (another author who wrote in a secondary language), but I found it difficult to stay engaged in the story. Perhaps it was just me and where I was at the moment in life."}, {"userName": "Shanae", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3368895-shanae", "userReview": "Great book about identity, the colonization of Africans living within borders established by the colonizers, the fluidity of ethnicity and everything else you can imagine about Somalia and Egypt.

The first in a trilogy of novels, Maps is rich in concept and execution, beautifully worked in the dense, intricate prose. It tells the story of Askar, orphaned as a child, who is rescued from his dead mother's side and raised in a small village by Misra, an older woman who develops a mysterious, protective bond with him.Eventually he moves to the capital to live with his prosperous Uncle Hilaal; however, Askar's origins continue to preoccupy him, and he grows into a serious, introspective youth fixed on the urgent question of his identity. Thus we have the central theme of this novel - identity - a theme that is woven with complexity as Askar begins with close ties to Misra, his substitute mother, and as he grows into young manhood with ties to the land, Somalia, metaphorically represented by maps which he studies and learns about first from Misra and later from Hilaal. It is with Misra that the boy Askar begins his journey toward becoming a man.\"Indubitably, she had done a most commendable job, training him in the nomadic lore of climatic and geographic importance -- that it was the earth which received the rains, the sky from whose loins sprang water and therefore life; that the earth was the womb upon whose open fields men and women grew food for themselves and for their animals. And man raised huts and women bore children and the cows grazed on the nearby pastures, the goats likewise; and the boy became a man,\" (p 134)There are unique and striking images presented as Askar lives with Misra. Those of water and of blood, dreams of a future that is yet unknown. \"Water: I associate with joy; blood: not so much with pain as with lost tempers and beatings. But I associate something else with blood -- future as read by Misra. Once I even made a pun -- my future is in my blood.\" (p 36)It gradually becomes true that Askar's blood and future are indelibly connected with Somalia. But her continues his search for identity. His father had died for the future of Somalia and Askar is taught about the past:\"'Whose are the unburied corpses?' Then the man smiled. He said: 'Our memories, our collective or if you like, our individual pasts. We leave our bodies in order that we may travel light -- we are hope personified. After all, we are the dream of a nation.\" (p 129)Hilaal, the cook and nurturer in his city home of Mogadiscio, is able to provide some answers for his baffled nephew on the subjects of African tradition, Somalian manhood and selflessness. Employing a poetic, imaginative style, Farah skillfully juxtaposes Askar's emotional turmoil and the struggles of his beloved Somalia under siege, as the characters try to understand why blood must be shed for territorial gain. In the end, Askar must choose between avenging his soldier father's death by joining the army, or pursuing his academic studies, but the choice is taken out of his hands by powerful external forces.This is a poetic coming-of-age story, following in the tradition of Dickens and many others. Farah makes it new with his poetic style, a unique narrative voice using different points of view, and with the complex relationships between family, friends, and the land. The result is a wonderful tale of searching for the identity of one's inner and outer self in a difficult world."}, {"userName": "Jaspreet", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/271946-jaspreet", "userReview": "About a week ago, I finished reading Maps by Nuruddin Farah . As with most things in my life, I fell behind on the process of writing the review. I told myself that it was okay to hold off on writing the review until I had some questions. Before getting to the questions, I would like to get a (short) general review. The book was surprisingly engaging and powerful. From publisher\u2019s weekly, here is a plot summary: Askar, orphaned as a child, is rescued from his dead mother's side and raised in a small village by Misra, an older woman who develops a mysterious, protective bond with him. Even when he moves to the capital to live with his prosperous Uncle Hilaal, Askar's origins continue to preoccupy him, and he grows into a serious, introspective youth fixed on the urgent question of his identity. Hilaal, the cook and nurturer in his city home, is able to provide some answers for his baffled nephew on the subjects of African tradition, Somalian manhood and selflessness. Employing a poetic, imaginative style, Farah skillfully juxtaposes Askar's emotional turmoil and the struggles of his beloved Somalia under siege, as the characters try to understand why blood must be shed for territorial gain. In the end, Askar must choose between avenging his soldier father's death by joining the army, or pursuing his academic studies, but the choice is taken out of his hands by powerful external forces. In a larger sense the book is about the intersection and conflict between family and national identity. The uncle and aunt were my favorite characters and to me they represented the progression from a patriarchal societal model to one that is more equal. LisaMM asked: For either book: what is the significance of the title? In this book, I think that Askar uses maps to find his place in the world. As the war continues, the maps change and he realizes that location is fluid. R asked: Although you haven't reviewed it yet, I'm aware that you really liked Maps. Can you pinpoint what exactly was so gripping or engaging about this book? I have been thinking about what made me enjoy Maps and the only thing I have come up with is the tone of the book. It is serious and at time ominous. However, you can really see the progression of the main character from a young boy to a young man who is trying to fit together the various pieces of information he is given. I also liked the way questions about good and evil were raised and handled. R also asked: I hear that the author of Maps has a very unique and powerful writing style. How would you describe it? Does it compare to any other authors you know? This is a hard question to answer because I seem to have writer\u2019s block in thinking about the author. The only thing I can think of is deceptively simple. The language and words he uses to express an idea are simple on the surface, but the sentiments and insight they provide are incredible. The only other author I can think of is David Malouf who wrote Remembering Babylon which I reviewed here."}, {"userName": "Martha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/132626-martha", "userReview": "The first half of the novel is not comfortable. A child (Askar) in living on the border of Somalia and Ethiopia in an area contested in the war tries to find his place in the world. He is Somali and his adoptive mother (Misra) is Ethiopian. Their relationship is too close for comfort. Askar's sense of self is all wrapped up in hers; in a sense, he is not weaned until he is sent away from the war-torn area to live with an uncle and aunt in Mogadishu. They are well-educated, well-off and apparently removed from the turmoil. The beginning of the book places the reader in a difficult position of feeling muddled (as is the narrator), having to navigate an opaque and confusing narrative, with shifts in voice (1st person, 2nd person, 3rd person), but all are the same narrator, Askar. Time shifts without warning, dreams are inserted without initially being clearly delineated as such, the child narrator is sucked into the weird, dysfunctional relationships of the adults surrounding him. And he is 0-6 in this section, thus with little agency. From early on, Askar is fascinated with maps and there are maps when he gets to Mogadishu as well. Maps trying to define boundaries of contested territories, artificial boundaries created by the British and Italian contested territories. Those who are well-educated speak Italian &/or English. Who are the Somali in this context? Who is Askar, a Somali child raised by an Ethiopian adoptive mother? Where are the boundaries, between Askar and Misra, between Ethiopia and Somalia? Will the maps tell him who he is? Will he join the army to fight for his mother country, he who is in a sense motherless?I'm partway through this and working to finish it before the book club meeting tonight. I'm worried that the book club members won't like it and it is a wonderful book. Just not an easy book, full of literary devices like shifts in time and in voice and magical realism. In some ways, it is a difficult book, both structurally and emotionally. The book club members tend to favor straightforward narratives and plot-driven books. I wanted us to do a Somali book, but was this a good choice? I guess I'll find out tonight. *****Yep, about 2/3 of the book club didn't show :) Ah well.

These characters symbolize the angst of the region\u2019s conflict. Just what determines nationality? Where does one\u2019s loyalty lie? What do boundaries on maps convey? This is perhaps best characterized by the following quote from the novel, \"The question is, does truth change? Or do we? Do we, men, women and children change?

It WAS amazing...and frustration and at times unnecessarily (IMHO) confusing. The voice changed from second person to third person to first person all through the book. So did chronology. The author is clearly brilliant and he is writing about a part of the world I know too little about. I am willing to trust that I am hearing about events and perspectives that I haven't researched and can't verify. The fact that he writes in English, his second language, and that he uses many words that are obscure and rarely used in English, ie. in one sentence he used the word \"secundine\" for placenta and \"parturition\" (which I knew, but still) for \"giving birth.\" Add to this that there was a good deal of magic realism, mythology, etc. throughout...and sometimes I couldn't tell if he was describing actual rituals and beliefs or if this was his imaginative, personal mythology. The main character, Askar, at times seems to become female...he menstruates...or is it his \"mother\" Misra? Askar is thinking in this passage: \"I have a strange feeling that there is another in me, one older than I\u2014a woman. I feel as if I have allowed a woman to live inside of me, and I speak her words not mine.\" And he describes that he was present, watching, at his own birth. The heavy reliance on dreams also places demands on the reader...Is this a dream? magic realism? a blend? In some ways I'd like to read this book with the author. He's been a teacher...there's a wonderful NYT interview with him about his literary preferences, for those interested. The book club discussion elicited very different opinions...One person skimmed, just felt the writing was all over the place, two others loved it. My husband liked the second half more, and realized at the end that the \"You\" sections are Askar telling the story to himself. He is clearly trying to create his identity...and the central theme is obviously the difficulty of doing that given Somalia's history, culture, late arrival to a written language. In light of Syria, that theme seems so relevant. I just wish it hadn't demanded so much me on so many fronts--literary tropes, language usage, shift from realism to surrealism.

The story is set in the country of Somalia which is located in the \"Horn of Africa.\" The political backdrop of the story is the 1970s Ogaden War between Ethiopia and the Western Somali Liberation Front. I knew little about this conflict before reading the book, but now I know that many ethnic Somalis live in the Ogaden, though it is part of Ethiopia. What I like most about this book is the author's examination of the relationship between Askar and Misra. Askar's parents are both dead and he ends up living with his paternal uncle. It is there that he is placed in the care of Misra. Askar is a peculiar child. He struggles to come to terms with the circumstances of his birth as he searches to find his place within his uncle's household. He forms an almost unnatural bond with his caregiver Misra, which the author spends a lot of the book describing. Sometimes the author's prose is cryptic and I wasn't sure whether or not Askar was daydreaming. At first I found this annoying, but then I came to believe that this was the author's way of letting the reader into Askar's stream of consciousness. Overall I enjoyed reading a story set in Somalia, although I found this particular one a bit slow-moving. I wanted to care more about the main character, but I never really made a connection with him or Misra. After reading this book I would definitely read another by this author.

It is the story of Askar, an orphan who struggles to find his personal identity as his homeland of Somalia struggles to find its national identity. In the novel we follow Askar's life from a village in the Ogaden with its tribal taboos, superstitions and suffocating limitations to metropolitan Mogadiscio with its cosmopolitan variety of experiences, viewpoints and opportunities. Like beliefs, values and ways of thinking, we assume that dream structures and patterns vary from culture to culture. There seems to be much of Somalian culture in the many dream sequences woven into the narrative. Askar's dream world is developed beautifully, lyrically with a strong dose of magic and mysticism. Stylistically I was intrigued by Farah's use of multiple points of view. We are not told the story by several different characters. The story is exclusively Askar's. What changes is the person; sometimes first person, sometimes third and most unusually, sometimes second. All three points of view are omniscient so we get an in-depth view of Askar's thinking and emotions. When the second person is used, the story is being told to Askar almost as if it was a reminder. This second person narrator seems to be an outside observer rather than any other of the story's richly developed characters.Maps is the first installment of a trilogy.

Some people really enjoy that style of story telling, but it's not always for me and this book in particular didn't do it for me as far as writing style goes.Another thing that bothered me (though I did get used to it) was that every chapter was written from a different perspective. Every three chapters cycled through telling the story in first, second, and third person - though all from the main character's perspective. It was strange, and I was annoyed at first... but when I finally got to the end of the book and I found out WHY it was written that way (you find out in the last couple of sentences) I totally appreciate it and really like it now. But I wanted to know why and wish I didn't have to read the WHOLE book to figure it out.Also, far too many dream sequences for my tastes.I did like the story. I found it to be a good story of a typical life in Ethiopia/Somalia during the rebellion of the Somali people in Ethiopia a few decades ago.
