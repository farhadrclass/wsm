They liken themselves to the sisterhood in the movie \"Steel Magnolias\". Each becomes involved in a summer romance with complications. They support each other through ups and downs and contemplate their futures from the perspective of strong women who are determined to plot their own course through life, not as trophy wives or homebodies but as independent women who follow their own heart and support the other women in their lives. Their self-named PMS Club is not what you might think. A good story, no big drama, normal summer and not the typical romance ending. I enjoyed the book, its humor and the style of writing. This is the second book I have read by this author, selected after enjoying another of her books. More are on my list now."}, {"userName": "spmorton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47830592-spmorton", "userReview": "Best friends Is was a short light read.

I got it because the title intrigued me. However, that is not what it stands for. I liked how it described the friendships & also that you don't choose who to love. It is a good summer read... especially since it takes place in the summer & on a beach. As all of her books, this one was just fun! I started it before I had our grandchildren for a week or I would have finished it sooner!"}, {"userName": "Betty Hansford", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63049804-betty-hansford", "userReview": "Fun StoryI enjoyed this book, because it explored the differences in the attitudes of men and women in relationships, beginnings and endings. It also went a bit in depth regarding social relationships between women who are very close friends and the men they chose.

The author lives in a part of Oklahoma where I spent many happy summer vacations with my mother's family. Secondly, the main characters live in Conway, Arkansas, where I spent my first two years of college. Thirdly, I read the reviews which all admired her writing style. They were right. She writes in a colloquial style with great humor. I loved the breezy style and thoroughly enjoyed being exposed to the Southernisms again. I got to be down South again without having to endure the humidity. All's well that ends well, as this does without once losing its quick pace and dragging in the middle as many books do. You can't beat this book for a light read that will have you chuckling on nearly every page..."}, {"userName": "Lee Ann", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16498389-lee-ann", "userReview": "Great read until the abrupt ending. Where were the steamy scenes like in the romance novel Dixie was reading? What actually happened between her and Boone? How did the summer just...end?

Seldom do I not finish a book or do I not want to finish a book, but this was one of them. It was just flat. The characters were not sympathetic. None of them were worth rooting for or even worth seeing to the end. It was just not a fun read. It was not really even a read that taught me anything.

Not even the good looking T-shirt painter who employed her right after he accused her of shop lifting.Boone Callahan spent all his summers in Florida, painting and selling T-shirts to the tourists. How was he supposed to know the woman running out of his shop with three tee shirts tucked under her arm wasn't trying to steal them? Or that when he hired her as part-time help she would wind up stealing his heart?Dixie and her friends, all school teachers from Arkansas, have endured wars and rumors of wars, true PMS, men problems, school problems, and shared the joys and sorrows of life for five years. Nothing could possibly destroy their friendship. But during the wonderfully hot summer, the very roots of the Sisterhood are shaken. Will it survive? Can Dixie and Boone find a future together?
