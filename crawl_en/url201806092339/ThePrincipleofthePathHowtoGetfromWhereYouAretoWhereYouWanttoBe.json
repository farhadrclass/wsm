But, therein lies the rub\u2026very few of us stop and actually think about this simple life principle.In a nutshell, this ultra simple yet grossly overlooked principle states this: the path you are on determines where you are going.Geographically, no one would argue with this point. If you want to go to New York City, heading west from Chicago isn\u2019t going to get you there. If you want to go to Paris, hopping on a plane to Tokyo is not part of the plan.Yet, when it comes to our lives, we ignore, or are blissfully unaware of the impact that our daily decisions have on our ultimate goals. The path leading to financial security is not strewn with credit card debt. If a healthy marriage is the goal, then \u2019innocently\u2019 flirting with a single co-worker is nowhere on the map. To get that diploma, waiting until the night before the final to start studying isn\u2019t the way to go. While the basic premise of The Principle of the Path is simple, the message is vital. Stanley\u2019s book is a reminder and a wake up call to all who have fallen asleep at the steering wheel of life. I wish I had read it years ago."}, {"userName": "Jake", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4869569-jake", "userReview": "Prior to this book, I had never read an Andy Stanley book. But, since I'm a part of a church that partners with his church, I figured I'd best check him out. I'm glad I chose this book as my first Stanley read cause it was both relevant and convicting to me.Stanley writes similarly to Dave Ramsey (whom I love). He is logical, humorous, and oftentimes makes very obvious realities seem fresh and unique in the way that he presents them.The \"principle of the path\" is all about how, in life, we make decisions; we focus our attention on something and thus make decisions toward that something; these decisions point us in a direction; and, ultimately our destination is determined by our direction. This may seem like an obvious reality; however, what Stanley points out over and over in this book is that in almost every arena of life, whether marriage, finances, parenthood, career, recreation, habits, or spirituality, we act as if intentions determine destinations. This is made manifest in the all-too-common moment when something unpleasant happens in our lives and we think \"Why is this happening to me?\" and certain other people around us could have or did warn us of the path that we were on and how it inevitably would lead to that destination. In the same way that there are negative destinations to the paths we can take, there are also many positive destinations to the paths we can take. Being responsible now pays off later just as being irresponsible now pays off later.This book takes something as obvious and real as the \"principle of the path\" and powerfully ties it into our lives as believers. Stanley touches on failure, success, and lost dreams as they pertain to this principle, making this book a very practical and relevant book to most anyone at any point on their own paths. I thoroughly enjoyed both Stanley's content and his writing style and would recommend this book to most people I know.Here are a few of my favorite quotes:\"My observation indicates that humans have a propensity for choosing paths that do not lead in the direction they want to go. For much of our decision making, we lean hard into our intentions and pay very little attention to the direction of the path we've chosen.\" p. 19\"What's so obvious to those watching often escapes us.\" p. 22\"Forgiveness and consequences are two different things. One does not override the other.\" p. 43\"There are all kinds of actions that feel extreme now that will look like common sense when you are looking back. What feels like sacrifice now will feel like an investment later.\" p. 49\"Our problem is rarely a lack of information or insight. It's not that we fail to see trouble brewing on the horizon. It's a lack of honesty. We have a hard time leveling with ourselves. We deceive ourselves about why we choose the things we choose.\" p. 65 --So true!\"Choosing the right path begins with submission, not information. Not ever direction. Submission. Specifically, submission to the One who knows where each path leads, as well as where it doesn't lead. Submission to the One who knows what's best for you better than you know what's best for you.\" p.83\"Emotionally driven decision making rarely leads us down the right path. In the emotion of the moment, we are easily swayed by conventional wisdom, cultural norms, the herd mentality, or even our own patterns of behavior.\" p.104\"Taking your cues from people who share your season of life is the equivalent of asking for and following the directions of someone who's never been where you want to go. And in some cases it is much worse than that. It may be like taking directions from someone who is lost.\" p.118\"Pride is hard to see in the bathroom mirror. But it is awfully easy to see in the rearview mirror. Looking back, it is all too clear to me why I refused to listen to the voices of reason when I was in over my head. It was pride.\" p. 129\"If we are honest, the cost of disentangling ourselves from unhealthy relationships and activities seems too high a price to pay. And at the same time, the benefits associated with paying attention to the right things seem so distant that they don't whet our appetite for change. And so we continue to live our lives captive to the things that have captured our attention.\" p.144"}, {"userName": "Mikayla Todd", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76530062-mikayla-todd", "userReview": "Great book.

You will reach the destination of the path you are on. It is in your best interest to acknowledge and examine your what direction you are headed.Small Group LeadersAs an additional bonus, a 10 Lesson Study Guide is included in the back of the book providing those interested in delving deeper and applying the ideas presented .

It is that your current direction will determine your destination.We look for solutions to problems that we brought on ourselves. It is not that we are not intelligent but there is a huge disconnect. We don\u2019t realize that our direction is determining our destination.The first step in choosing the right path is not a problem of information but one of submission.We need to acknowledge God in all of our ways and decisions.Our emotions confuse us and cause us to make poor decisions that put us on the path or in the direction that will cause us great trouble. All of life is filled with decision making situations that occur in emotionally charged environments.The book is filled with simple wisdom that we have overlooked. As Andy says there is really nothing new here but we need to understand and apply what we know. We heard our parents say it and we know it to be true. It is your direction more than it is what you are doing.I suggest that young people read the book to learn and apply the principle of the path. It will save them a lifetime of questions. It will provide them direction about the decisions they face everyday. It will also help them to avoid those life-wasting detours along the way.We never get to the point that we do not need the wisdom of others and wise counsel. There are so many of these good quotes in the book that the quotes alone make the book worth reading.What gets our attention determines our direction and ultimately our destination.You can\u2019t trust your intentions so get focused on the direction you are taking today.I found this book to be worth reading."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1012614-mark", "userReview": "A very practical book on spirituality... or a very spiritual book on practical living - take your pick. Written with the usual charm & warmth evidenced by Andy Stanley (my guess is that this began life as a sermon series), he does a great job of encouraging wisdom in life choices based on Biblical principles.For those who like their Christian books filled with Scripture references, this is going to be a frustrating read, however - while he uses Bible verses & stories to establish & underline his points, he isn't interested in proving that he won a Bible Drill tournament when he was a kid - an approach I appreciate as it makes this very helpful book easier to hand off to those who are still working through questions about faith in Jesus Christ.The last chapter (on how to respond when you realize that previous life choices have cut you off from your dreams) is worth the price of admission by itself."}, {"userName": "Donovan Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7042849-donovan-martin", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed, if that can be said of a book that seriously challenges a person to consider their every step, Andy Stanley's book. Stanley presents in a well written manner life principles that are consistant across the ages. If a person does one thing consistently, certain outcomes are consistently the result. He applies biblical principles to the book of course but also concludes that these principles are faithful even outside the community of faith.

A simple message. The choices you make along your path determine where you will end up. Hence the principle of \u201cthe path\u201d. Unless of course, something or someone interferes with the choices you make, in which case, you can end up somewhere else. While the advice offered in this book is relevant for anyone, it is primarily for Christian readers because it relies heavily on biblical references and includes some discussion on sin and repentance.My thoughts...The first chapter was a really good introduction and got me pumped to read the rest of the book, but I was wrong. I felt as though, based on the subtitle, this book would give some insight into how to get from point A to point B. It didn't. The book basically shared the things that we all know we should be doing, but did not share how to make yourself do them. Stanley's thesis is pretty clear from the beginning- the choices we make determine our outcome. Making a series of poor choices probably will result in some poor outcomes. Each subsequent chapter outlines more examples of how people were faced with choices and how those choices led them to where they were. I kept hoping the next chapter would provide new information, or more advice on guiding one's self or organization down the path to where we want to go. But it never got better, and I have to say I was disappointed with this book.There was something Mr. Stanley stated in the book that I really did not care for, where he says, \u201cthe casual sex as a teen and cervical cancer or infertility at thirty\u201d. That statement really angered me. Infertility and cervical cancer are punishments for having casual sex as a teenager? What about the women who didn't have casual sex as teenagers and still end up with one or the other or maybe both? That just blames the woman suffering from these problems\u2026what an antiquated view of the world!After reading that statement, I read the book differently. Yes, you can choose the path you take, but it's not always clear where it leads. You can take what seems to be a promising job, but get fired, laid off or you might not like it. You could be in a car accident that was in no way, shape or form your fault. You could lose a loved one various different ways. Many things happen in life that cannot be easily predicted. Hindsight is 20/20, it's easy to say \"Oh, I should have never gone out with him\" or \"I knew the weather was bad\" but I think most people cannot see that far into their future to know that the career they chose at 25 would be eliminated by the time they were 40.Upon reading the book, I realized the tone was very depressing overall. After the first few chapters we get it: Our choices determine the path we take in life. Good or bad. For the bad though, Stanley doesn't offer much hope. If your marriage fails, too bad, you took the wrong path. In debt? So sorry, you are messed up for life. There seems to be no answers given, and no hope instilled. The author gave no common sense strategies to help those who found themselves on the wrong path other than telling them where that path would lead. He also gave no help for those seeking the right path. He just stated the obvious repeatedly without any practical help. To make it worse, Stanley felt the need to justify the obvious, by spending far too long exaggerating a few verses of Proverbs. I am talking chapters of defensive-sounding Scriptural lay-level exegesis.And then he repeated it all again, basically saying everyone who is in debt, buys new cars with loans, has a bad marriage or disobedient kids are idiots with only themselves to blame.On a positive note, the book was a fairly easy read and his examples are relatable. While I felt like I needed something more and deeper from this book, I do think there are those in the world need to know that making reckless choices now will only harm them in the end. I would recommend this book for those who would like encouragement in the truth that making wise choices now is making a choice for goodness in your life. Also, the book ends with a Study Guide that guides the reader through a process for applying the ideas discussed in the book.Thank You so much Book Sneeze for letting me be a part of your program!

Core idea: good intentions and following your heart is no guarantee that things will work out well in the end. There are actions that lead to specific destinations--and we tend to get into patterns of actions. When we choose actions that take us down the wrong path, it's often because we focus on short-term happiness over long-term happiness (e.g. chocolate ice cream vs. exercise).If there were more specifics on which actions led down which paths, then it would be five stars. As it is, it assumes that you know which financial choices are good only refers to general examples. It assumes that you know which parenting habits lead to mature kids and which don't. Again, there are some good example stories, but not enough to map a path."}, {"userName": "Ciara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4492530-ciara", "userReview": "I read this book on a recommendation from the pastor of our church- it is not the kind of book I would usually pick up. Keeping that in mind, I tried to be open-minded about the message as I went through it. I think Stanley offers a lot of practical advice on how to get from where you are in life to where you want to be. Namely, that if you want to get somewhere in life: be a spiritual leader, a great parent, or have a fulfilling marriage- you can't expect these things to crop up on their own. You have to do the hard work that will lead you there. There is a lot in this book that I liked and agreed with. I think if there are things you want to accomplish, you don't just pray for them- you move toward those goals in a practical way. It was a strong admonition to live intentionally, avoid regret, and seek advice from those who are wiser and further along in life than you are. There was also a reminder that we are not solely the crafters of our own destiny, but we rely on the will of God to accomplish (or re-evaluate) our dreams and goals. From a spiritual perspective, I think it was a little light on the latter points. As someone who believes in God's sovereignty and His purpose and plan for my life, I was a bit ruffled by the assertion that we set ourselves on a trajectory for success through our actions- I believe God does that. I don't think Stanley makes one point to the exclusion of the other (scripturally, there is a delicate balance between free will and God's sovereignty) but his explanation of the second is light and doesn't make an appearance until mid way through the book. Another slight problem I had with this book was from a leadership perspective. I admire those people who live with a great level of control in their lives and have conquered debt, go to the gym regularly, have great marriages and parent well. I aspire to that. However, I think it can also be a source of pride, especially as a church leader. Stanley mentions several circumstances where it was blaringly obvious to him that someone was doing something wrong (and stupid)- marrying the wrong person, getting into debt, buying something unnecessary, etc. I felt his approach to these situations was a little self-righteous (basically, swallowing an \"I told you so\" but writing it all over the pages of his book). I hope that as a leader I am able to set an example but act with compassion and grace when others stumble, and attempt to forego the judgement between the lines of this book. One thing he covered very well was the regret over lost dreams- what we do when our life plan doesn't match up with God's reality. It was an emotional and enlightening chapter, probably the best of the book, and left me with the simple but comforting revelation that even though there are things in my life I have mourned over and would have done differently, God chose the path of my life with a plan and a purpose and I was never entitled to those dreams in the first place. If all I took away from the book was that one thought, that alone was worth it."}, {"userName": "Marcia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4836277-marcia", "userReview": "Some really good bits especially on not being surprised with outcomes when you look at which path you're on."}, {"userName": "Book Him Danno", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/872245-book-him-danno", "userReview": "This book doesn\u2019t mince words, the author tells it like it is and sometimes that\u2019s a hard thing to hear. But if you are somewhere you don\u2019t want to be, then you need this book. He\u2019s not just talking spiritually, he\u2019s talking everything.Are you having financial, relationship, personal, and/or employment problems? If so, you need to stop and figure out what you need to change and how to do it. The author offers Bible and personal stories from his ministry to help you find the right direction. He gives you questions to ask yourself and explains how to tell yourself the truth, instead of the lies that got you in the mess in the first place. Honesty is the best policy, even to ourselves. Everyone else sees through the lies we tell them and us, so save yourself the trouble and don\u2019t lie in the first place.His next section made me really think. Attention determines direction, so where is your attention? What are you spending your time doing? That will be the direction you are going. Do you really want to go that way? Do you want to get out of debt, but you need to buy the latest gadget no matter what the cost? Do you want to marry someone you respect and adore, but you troll bars where the less then desirable members of society hang out? Do you want a promotion, but you arrive late and leave early whenever its convenient(more often than not?) These are tough questions, but direction determines your destination and many of us start out on the wrong road and years later wonder what happened. Decide where you want to be and get started going that direction and doing the things that will get you there.I saw myself in this book. I\u2019ve taken the easy way out more times than not and then wondered why I ended up without the job, education, or finances I really wanted. Where I am now is from the attention I placed on things in the past. I really can\u2019t complain too much, but maybe a different major in college would have been a good idea, and if we had read Dave Ramsey years ago we would be better off financially now. Read this book and you will see yourself and maybe, like me, you will have the desire to make a course correction and get on the right path again.Everything you do determines where you end up in life. Think about it and I bet you can see times you took the wrong path. What\u2019s amazing is, that it\u2019s not always your parents fault.I enjoyed this book, maybe not the fact that I now realize how many times I've screwed up and lost my direction, but it was well worth reading. It is short and to the point, take a few hours and discover a thing or two about yourself."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4929332-john", "userReview": "All of us want to arrive at the right destination. The key is in choosing the right path. That, in a single sentence, is the message of this book. The one thing you must focus on in life to achieve any goal, to arrive at any destination, is to choose the right path. At first I thought, is that worth reading a whole book about? I found out, yes, most definitely it's worth reading, if it's written by the right teacher. Andy Stanley has done a masterful job of taking this one theme, and leading us through how to apply it to the business of daily living. Chapter by chapter, he lays out how it is our direction, not our intention, that determines our destination. In other words, we can say where we want to go in life, and want to go there, but unless we make the right choices, we will end up someplace else. The book delves into why we so commonly make choices that cause us to arrive at the wrong destination. At the heart of our bad choices is, well, our heart. As Stanley puts it, Your decision-making environments are not emotionally neutral. More often than not, the circumstances we face are saturated with powerful emotions. Those emotions easily turn into misguided passions. In the end, passion clouds the ability to accurately evaluate the circumstance in order to choose the right path. In the end, Stanley says there are three great questions we must ask ourselves: 1. Why am I doing this, really? 2. If someone in my circumstances came to me for advice, what course of action would I recommend? 3. In light of my past experience, my future hopes, and my dreams, what is the wise thing to do? It's usually not that we can't get the answers to these questions, but that our hearts often don't want to face the answers. That's where we have to submit to God and be willing to trust Him. The Principle of the Path is a book that will benefit anyone who is willing to be humble enough to read it while taking an honest look at themselves. I took pages and pages of notes as I read through it. Stanley is gifted in stating truth in just the right words to make it stick in your heart. It's not that there are any hidden secrets to the universe in this book, just a lot of ancient common sense presented in a way that will change your life if you let it. Read this book. Read this book."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2393718-nick", "userReview": "The cover and tag lines would seem to indicate a self-help book. Some reviewers have even labeled this as \"self-help.\" I don't believe that this is a fair description. Stanley takes his readers back to the Scriptures--particularly the Wisdom literature portions--to have a frank discussion about a simple topic that many of us ignore to our detriment: Direction, not intention, determines our destination. The small decisions in our lives, are not just one time events--they add up to a path. And that path leads somewhere. Where are we spending our time and resources? What are we thinking about? We are on a path...is it leading to a place that we ultimately want to be?Andy Stanley reminds us that the self-help line to \"follow your heart\" is a very dangerous thing to do because \"the heart is deceitful above all else\" (Jeremiah 17:9). Following your heart or your emotions will get you in to trouble. I have seen this to be true in my own life and the lives of friends, family, and acquaintances. The truth is that we have to ask God for guidance and rely on Him. In order to help us discern God's truth, versus subjective notions of \"this must be God's will,\" Stanley offers many verses to pray and principles to observe. Wisdom is about relying on God and not our own understanding.Even though many of the insights from this book seem simple, this book does a great job of walking the reader through the topic and connecting all the dots. C.S. Lewis quotes Dr. Johnson in Mere Christianity as saying that \"People need to be reminded more often than they need to be instructed.\" Then he states that, \"The real job of every moral teacher is to keep on bringing us back, time after time, to the old simple principles which we are all so anxious not to see...\" (78). Pick it up and be reminded."}], "description": "Not where you want to be?Wondering how to get there?Why is it that smart people with admirable life goals often end up far from where theyintended to be?

Why do our expectations aboutour own future often go unmet?What if you knew the answer to those questions?
