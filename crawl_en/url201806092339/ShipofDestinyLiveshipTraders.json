I really have to give this praise to Robin Hobb. Having read six books and one novella so far, whether I love it or not (mostly love), I found all her stories to be unpredictable. The book is filled with\u2014once again\u2014amazing characters developments, political turmoil, dragons, and a few great nautical battle scenes. In addition to that, there are a lot of revelations to secrets that were hinted ever since the first book; everything was resolved with no loose ends and the book also shed light on what to come in the future series. I almost absolutely loved reading this one, there were a few things I disliked which I\u2019ll get into later but first let me dive talk a bit about the characters in this trilogy.I\u2019ve praised Hobb on her characterizations strength in all my review of her books so far and I envisioned you\u2019re going to see this as an occurring event. Hobb is seriously superb in developing her characters, especially in this trilogy. Almost every single character ended up playing a role that gave the story its own charm and none of the characters in this trilogy ended up the same way from their first appearance; I mean it, every single character has gone through their own battle and struggles that changed them, for better or worse. I had a problem with the serpents' POV in the first and second book, they felt completely unnecessary, but in here it all finally made sense why they were necessary. The only character that remains the same was Amber and there\u2019s a special reason for that.There\u2019s this phrase that\u2019s used countless times in many novels, especially in YA fantasy, \u201cshe\u2019s unlike any other woman\u201d which ironically, makes the female characters mentioned the exact copy of all the other woman that received that description. However, I can assure you that Malta seriously deserves the title of \u201cunlike any other woman\u201d. This character\u2019s growth from the first book to the third book is a coming of age tale at its finest. She grew from a highly spoiled brat and one of the most despicable characters I\u2019ve ever read into one of the most interesting characters in the trilogy. And then there\u2019s the liveship, Paragon, which I can\u2019t stress highly enough how happy I am reading his story line and background. One final thing on the characters, Hobb seriously isn\u2019t afraid to make her characters suffer.\n\n\u201cWhen you fear to fail, you fear something that has not happened yet. You predict your own failure, and by inaction, lock yourself into it.\u201d \n\nHobb has spent a lot of time building towards the last 250 pages and it was really worth it. The moment of convergence where all the characters that have been spread out across the continent throughout the trilogy finally meet each other were rewarding to read. This made the last 250 pages of this book incredibly compelling to read. Unfortunately, despite my praises, I still can\u2019t give this book a full 5 stars.This book was in my opinion a bit too huge for its own good. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I don\u2019t mind reading a tome, I absolutely loved and finished Oathbringer (450k words) in five days and I still wanted more from it. But this one was simply unnecessary long. There were at least 100 pages that of practically Hobb repeating things that have been stated. This was more evident in the first 300 pages of this book during the Bingtown political discussions, which went on for way too long. Right now, I don\u2019t even remember half of the discussions that were discussed there because they were almost like fillers and it got super tedious after a while. I've mentioned this in my previous review and I still think that Serrila\u2019s POV was completely pointless in my opinion. It can be cut off completely and it won\u2019t affect this trilogy at all. Having read up to this point though, I guess I\u2019ll just have to accept that Robin Hobb has a trademark to ramble and being wordy than necessary, whether it\u2019s her own fault or the editors I have no idea. These are all just minor issues I had, the second half and Hobb\u2019s prose made up for these cons and they were fantastic, otherwise, this would be a gigantic problem.For those of you who are wondering if you can read this without reading Farseer or not, you absolutely can if you want. There\u2019s one major character from the Farseer trilogy that\u2019s here but if you haven\u2019t read Farseer, you probably won\u2019t know it\u2019s him, that\u2019s all you\u2019ll miss. However, if you\u2019re willing to read Farseer, I strongly recommend to finish the first two book and see how you feel about it first. If you don't like it, just read a summary of the third book, Assassin\u2019s Quest, on Wikipedia. It will save you a HUGE amount of time and believe me, that book deserves to be skip, finishing that one almost made me give up completely on Robin Hobb, and this is coming from someone who actually enjoyed the first and second book in the trilogy.Overall, The Liveship Traders is still a marvelous and satisfying trilogy to read, it\u2019s so much better than the Farseer trilogy in my opinion. Also, I\u2019m now super eager start Tawny Man, which from what I\u2019ve heard is the most highly praised trilogy written by Robin Hobb and I will definitely do that after one or two book break. Although this trilogy fell a bit short to be included into my all time favorite trilogy list, I still highly recommend this trilogy for anyone who loves epic fantasy with a lot of characters POV and well-written characters\u2019 development.Picture: My copies of Liveship Traders\nSeries review:\nShip of Magic: \n\n4.5/5 stars\n\nThe Mad Ship: \n\n4/5 stars\n\nShip of Destiny: \n4.5/5 stars\nLiveship Traders: \n13/15 stars\nYou can find this and the rest of my Adult Epic/High Fantasy & Sci-Fi reviews at BookNest"}, {"userName": "Bookdragon Sean ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27788046-bookdragon-sean", "userReview": "I loved the ending of this because everything was resolved perfectly, and at the same time the events have far, far, reaching consequences. These will no doubt affect the Six Duchies. This made the ending so strong for me because I couldn\u2019t wait to read more. I couldn\u2019t wait to see how far Amber has (and will) shape the world in accordance with her prophecies.  It\u2019s all about the dragons!  'The magic behind all this slowly began to reveal itself across the trilogy and, finally, in this book it was released. The revelation of what drives the liveships was completely bizarre, but as the novel progressed it became clear how well established this outlandish idea was. It\u2019s all so strange and wonderfully accidental. The magic system is very well thought out to say the least. If someone would have told me when I began reading that this weirdness was behind it, I would have laughed. But Hobb is the master of her craft; she makes the impossible magical: she makes it real. \u201cOne does not need the size of a dragon to have the soul of a dragon.\u201dI found myself liking Paragon more and more as the series developed. He initially appears as a sullen brute who is about to explode with unbridled rage. But the ship has a massive backstory. He\u2019s a victim, a big one. He has been abandoned and defaced; he has been used and mistreated. However, Amber saw into the depths of him; she saw what lurked behind his wooden exterior, and she gives him the most ultimate gift. Unsurprisingly, during the process she pays great homage to her greatest friend and biggest love. Such a fool. (see what I did there)  It all came together in the end  (^^ I love this pic!)The climax was everything it needed to be. The characters all had one big clash at the high seas and in doing so Hobb expanded her fantasy universe tremendously. The importance of a group of serpents, which I initially perceived as insignificant, became abundantly clear. They\u2019re so central to Hobb\u2019s magic. I always wondered why they were so drawn to the boats. In retrospect it\u2019s all rather obvious. But when I was reading I was rather dumbfounded. I wonder how the rest of the world will feel when they find out, if they find out. \u201cDo you not see how strange and wonderful that is? That all history balances on an affair of the human heart?\u201dMalta is, perhaps, the character that will go furthest in this. (Excluding Amber of course.) Her path has been intertwined with that of the dragons. Her development was wonderful; she went from an annoying brat to someone with real character: she grew up. Some of the other characters had semi-predictable endings. With her it was fairly surprising. Overall, this was a good ending to a good trilogy. I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how Hobb uses elements of this in later books.  The Liveship Traders 1. Ship of Magic- A seafaing 3.5 stars 2. The Mad Ship- A tumultuous four stars.  3.

How I loved the characters! They are so vivid and real. Althea and Brashen are to fall in love with. Im no big fan of pirate tales, but Robin Hobb just enthralls me. I just had the best start of the morning by finishing this book. Woke up before 8 am ( on a day off .....) Decided to read the last few pages ( fell asleep last night on the couch ) and there were cookies next to me....healthy start of the day!Im still convinced everyone should just read Robin Hobb.

Without a doubt! (This review contains some spoilers of book 1 and 2)Part of it is very typical Robin Hobb (after 6 books I\u2019m allowed to say that right?) she makes characters so incredible real they become existing people. I\u2019ve said it before, but it\u2019s just really true: they become people for you to love or loathe. But it\u2019s also remarkable how mean she is to them all: she sends them through hell, leaves them there without food or drinks, and then kindly asks them to walk back barefoot. Mean, mean!There is however one thing she does in this trilogy she didn\u2019t do in the previous one; for this one she took a trick of the fantasy writers tool box: multiple point of view characters with storylines that are all coming together. Not one \u2018catalyst\u2019 but a whole family of them. I thought the general world building was very well done. The serpents, dragons, elderlings, pirates\u2026 enough mystery to keep you on your toes until the very last chapter.Safe to say that i loved this trilogy. It just has all the elements right: Well developed characters, check. Marvelous world building, check. Solid writing, check. Enough tension to keep you going, check. A few unpredictable twists, check! And so on.I want to end this review with Paragon. While I\u2019m typing this, I have Mumford and Sons playing in the background (a CD obviously, if they would be live in my living room I wouldn\u2019t be typing!), and this song reminds me of him. \nNow I'll be bold, as well as strongUse my head alongside my heartSo take my flesh, and fix my eyesThat tethered mind free from the lies memories\n In my mind, I see Paragon, waiting all those years on the beach for someone who will push him back into the winds. Someone to restore him to former glory.

If you have read The Farseer Trilogy and are debating whether to read this trilogy next or skip ahead to the Tawny Man trilogy \u2013 I can\u2019t recommend The Liveships Trilogy enough. I think there are little tidbits throughout to reward those who choose to continue in publication order.One thing Hobb does well, is produce interesting, well thought out, multidimensional characters. Many of the characters who are arguably \u201cgood\u201d have their ugly side. I\u2019m thinking here of Althea, Malta, Wintrow, Keffria and more. And Hobb forces us to look at the redeemable qualities of those characters who, if not totally evil, are pretty close. I\u2019m thinking here in particular of Kennit, the pirate who would be king. Up till about halfway through this book, I found Kennit for all his flaws and self centered ambition, to be a fairly likeable character. A lot of that stems from the kindness he extends to Wintrow and his relationship with the liveship Vivacia. However, come the second half of this book, Robin Hobb peels back the layers to reveal who Kennit really is. What motivates him. What has made him the man he is. It was not a pretty picture. In the second half of this book there were some truly jaw dropping, gut wrenching, and even sickening revelations that turned a lot of my assumptions throughout the series on their head. Hobb takes us down some dark and ugly pathways relating to the past which we then see perpetuated in the present. Hobb has a reputation for putting her characters through the mill, but this book took it that step further again and led me as the reader into some pretty uncomfortable places.Still, for all the dark and uncomfortable places we are forced to travel there are also some glorious moments,. Like the rise of the dragon Tintaglia, soaring and hunting and doing battle. Also the growth of the mad ship Paragon, arguably the character who develops the most through the series. I think overall the series finishes positively, however, to say this story has a happy ending would be over simplistic. Victory comes at a very high cost to many of the characters. Alongside the triumph there is also tragedy. For those who overcome, the face of redemption is covered in scar tissue.Loved it4 stars"}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "I did it! I finished it! My reading of these three 900-page-books has been quite a journey, but in the end I'm glad I stuck to the end and got a great reading experience out of it. This is the last book in the trilogy, so obviously I can't tell you too much about the story. However, I can tell you that this last installment was quite breathtaking and intense. With this novel, I finally felt a deep connection to all of the characters, maybe because I've been following their journeys for so many pages. I was a bit hesitant to pick up this third book because my reading of the second book was a disappointment. I felt like the story became too silly and too dull, and that was after a great start with the first book that I rated 4 stars. Nevertheless, I now know that I love this series because of its originality and its intenseness. Robin Hobb rarely leaves you bored in this fantastic world of dragons, ships and traders - I think I just read the second book at the wrong time. This is definitely a great series for everyone!

Heavy feels, heavy twists, heavy quotes, HEAVY! \u00a0Hobb is a master at constructing epic sentences while diving into the deepest depths of human nature. You want to take your time with this book to make sure you savor every single beautifully crafted sentence. I highlighted several quotes form this book.

All the threads just come together perfectly in the end... but the whole adventure is needed to experience this, and the start can be a bit difficult. But no adventure is worth taking if there is no challenge! It's all worth it and more in the end!The character development is AMAZING! Across the board, the characters change gracefully into their new roles since book one and two. Characters you despise end up being the target of sympathy. SYMPATHY! Such a huge theme in the story. Characters you think are weak end up strong, loved end up hated, rich end up poor. It's amazing to see the transformations and I can't describe it well enough. You will have to just read! :DIn the end it's not about loving or hating the characters, it's about understanding them, and you will understand them.

It's not often that after reading a 2* book by an author I will continue on with their work but with Hobb I am so thrilled that I did go on to the Liveship books after the Farseer ones because truly she's a miracle writer and her ability to craft convincing, beautiful and stunning characters, worlds and ideas is unparalleled. This is book 3 in the Liveship books and so naturally I cannot give away the plot of the story but suffice to say we're once more following the characters we've grown to love, hate and be drawn in by. I because me enraptured by this world that at some points of reading this I fell asleep only to find myself dreaming about the magic of the world and the characters within the book!!I think Paragon, Malta and Selden were solidly my favourite of the characters developed in this book but there are so many who come a very very close second place to that. They each had their own plotlines which were seriously moved along within the pages of this book and each one became so vastly improved and different from the characters they began as.On the whole I would say this is a series I'd recommend to anyone who loves fantasy and wonderful characters because truly it is character-focused. Whilst this book had more of a political emphasis than some of the previous ones it didn't lose my interest or irritate me with the amount of politics shown because it still focused in on those characters we know and love. This book and this series will forever cement Hobb as a fabulous writer in my mind and has made me wish to pick up the rest of her Elderlings books as soon as I can. I cannot wait to uncover more of the mysteries which are hinted at in this book and unfurl the tapestry of time, prophecy and the destiny for this world because there's so many original and cool ideas woven in. An amazing book once more and a great conclusion to the trilogy (unlike that of the Farseer books) and so I would say it's a solid 5*s and a highly recommended read.(p.s you can start Hobb with this series but you'll spoil elements of the Farseer books for yourself. Personally I enjoyed the first 2 Farseer books, but disliked the third. I'd recommend reading the first two but maybe skipping the third and just looking up spoilers for that one because it was so overly long.

Oh, Hobb, te amaba desde antes sin saberloNo me voy a extender mucho con este libro. Tiene medio punto menos que el anterior pero es solo una cuesti\u00f3n formal. No me abrum\u00f3 tanto como Las Naves de la Locura pero tuvo sus muchos momentos en los que me qued\u00e9 mirando la hoja con la boca abierta e incapaz de seguir leyendo. En m\u00e1s de una ocasi\u00f3n (y extra\u00f1amente todas relacionadas con la nao Paragon, qui\u00e9n lo dir\u00eda) casi se me escapa una l\u00e1grima. Pero tambi\u00e9n en muchas escenas rod\u00e9 los ojos por los di\u00e1logos, algunas explicaciones que me parecieron muy tontas, y por la mala traducci\u00f3n y edici\u00f3n. Anhelo leer a esta autora en ingl\u00e9s porque las traducciones me tienen mal. Me pareci\u00f3 oportuno mencionar lo de los di\u00e1logos, porque es la primera vez que me sucede con Hobb, y no s\u00e9 si la traducci\u00f3n tendr\u00e1 que ver. Con los dos libros anteriores no me pas\u00f3 y correspond\u00edan a una editorial distinta. Tal vez se deba a eso, o es que Hobb realmente la pifi\u00f3 feo con los di\u00e1logos en este \u00faltimo libro, sobretodo los cap\u00edtulos alrededor de la \u00faltima parte.

Tard\u00e9 en leerlo porque, ciertamente, no quer\u00eda que se terminara. Quiz\u00e1s m\u00e1s adelante haga otro comentario, por hoy es todo. -----------------Edit 29/07/16Bueno, creo que me siento en mis cabales como para decir algo acerca de este tercer libro y de la saga en general.Tengo malos recuerdos de los libros de piratas. A decir verdad, cuando ten\u00eda catorce a\u00f1os, en la escuela me obligaron a leer La Isla del Tesoro. Lo \u00fanico que hizo que lograra terminar el libro fue imaginarlo como la pel\u00edcula de Disney, porque no solo fue una lectura densa y aburrida, sino que no me interesaba para nada el t\u00f3pico. Aprend\u00ed vocabulario de barcos, s\u00ed (y sorprendentemente \"verga\" es un t\u00e9rmino n\u00e1utico, s\u00ed, s\u00ed, compa\u00f1eros), pero m\u00e1s all\u00e1 de eso, me dej\u00f3 una marca terrible: la padec\u00ed, sufr\u00eda cada vez que ten\u00eda que abrir el libro, y as\u00ed no es c\u00f3mo se debe realizar una lectura, tan forzada. Desde entonces, las historias de piratas (excepto Pirates of the Caribbean) tienen mi total prejuicio. Esto sucede cuando te obligan a leer un libro que no es para vos en ese momento.Por eso cuando descubr\u00ed que la saga que le continuaba a la de Traspi\u00e9 era esta, no lo quer\u00eda creer. \u00bf\u00a1Piratas!? \u00bfHobb? \u00a1Con lo que me gusta la autora! \u00a1No pod\u00eda ser!Pero Hobb demostr\u00f3 no solo quebrar con el esquema habitual de las novelas fant\u00e1sticas, sino tambi\u00e9n romper con mis prejuicios.Dicho esto, llegu\u00e9 a The Liveship Traders no con las mejores expectativas. Pero a medida que le\u00eda, todo iba mejorando: personajes, argumento, narraci\u00f3n. Todo me interes\u00f3, todo me fascin\u00f3, y no me decepcion\u00f3 en absoluto. Sin embargo, en este \u00faltimo libro, detect\u00e9 un declive. Como expuse antes, no s\u00e9 si se deber\u00e1 a la traducci\u00f3n o a la edici\u00f3n, pero tanto la narraci\u00f3n de Hobb como varios de sus di\u00e1logos me fueron inveros\u00edmiles y sosos, algo que no suele suceder PARA NADA con esta mujer (quiero creer que fue la traducci\u00f3n, d\u00e9jenme creer). Hubo varias cosas que me molestaron de Las Naves del Destino: -Lo cierto es que personajes adolescentes/ni\u00f1os hablan como si tuvieran treinta a\u00f1os (Selden es un caso especial, supongo, pero aun as\u00ed, qu\u00e9 chocante ver a un ni\u00f1o de \u00bfcu\u00e1ntos a\u00f1os? \u00bfCinco, seis?, hablar como si fuera Plat\u00f3n). -Que el destino de todo el Mitonar haya descansado casi pr\u00e1cticamente sobre los hombros de una muchacha de 14 (Cof cof, Malta, cof cof). -Que el final se haya desinflado en las \u00faltimas cien p\u00e1ginas. -Que los \u00faltimos cap\u00edtulos hayan servido solo para exponer lo sucedi\u00f3 a continuaci\u00f3n del cl\u00edmax, a trav\u00e9s de las voces de los personajes (que queda ESPANTOSO). Me dio la sensaci\u00f3n de que Hobb quiso dar un cierre a todos, TODOS sus personajes sin olvidarse ninguno, y esto le pas\u00f3 porque en Las Naves de la Locura introdujo muchos nuevos puntos de vista y varios personajes que parec\u00edan tornarse importantes para el argumento, pero que en este tercer libro se fueron desvaneciendo (Grag Tenira, el Ralo y su hija, y el resto de los Tatuados), y para no crear un agujero argumental en el libro, puso en voz de sus personajes lo que le pas\u00f3 a cada uno luego de que \"todo terminara\". Me parece bien que no haya querido crear un agujero argumental, pero no era la manera. En fin. El resto, como siempre, sorprendente, fascinante y qued\u00e9 boquiabierta m\u00e1s de una vez. Empatic\u00e9 demasiado con ciertos personajes (Dechado/Paragon -dependiendo de la traducci\u00f3n- se convirti\u00f3 en uno de mis favoritos) y sent\u00ed los descubrimientos como si estuviera presente all\u00ed mientras suced\u00edan. Navegu\u00e9 con las naos, me cayeron sobre la cara las gotas que las olas liberaban y sufr\u00ed junto con los capitanes de estos barcos. Llegados a este punto, puedo decir que Hobb es una autora que recomiendo a los cuatro vientos. Incluso si sus historias son sobre piratas."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43881851-ron", "userReview": "Reading Ship of Destiny fulfilled the majority of my expectations. Being the third and final book of the Liveship Traders trilogy, I was hoping it would do just that. Actually, Ship of Destiny exceeded some of my hopes with an open-ended finish. Matching the standards of the first two books can be no easy task for Robin Hobb, but it\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned not to fear. She always comes through. Somehow the tension provided in these three books only managed to increase as the story continued, which blows my mind. In total truth, many chapters were on the wordy side, but I after completing the series, I realize that I would rather have the whole than only chosen parts.It\u2019s also a pleasing close to the series because it left me with both the feeling of being complete and yet hungry for more. That brings to mind another great point about the author. She is always looking forward in her books, or it seems that way. A trilogy makes up one complete story, but it also provides a tangent to separate story just down the road. If I hadn\u2019t read this series, I would have missed a very satisfying connection to the Rain Wild Chronicles."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "There are some beautiful ideas in there -- about dragons, and the life cycle of a dragon -- and there are references to the Farseers trilogy that complete that story, that explain things. Yet it's also, for quite a few people I've spoken to, quite tedious to read. This time as I was going through, I tried to put into words why it's broken for me. Comparisons to the Farseers trilogy abound, as well as spoilers for both trilogies and probably for the Tawny Man trilogy as well. Some of this, I've already written elsewhere.Essentially, I have three main issues I'd point to -- all somewhat interwoven.NarrativeI think it suffers from being in third person rather than first. All the sense of someone setting down memoirs with all the relevant details put in the right places is lost, and it's less easy for Hobb to fit in the back story she needs to make the \"front\" story work. For example, Paragon's story -- it could come out through dialogue and interaction, for example, between Mingsley and a client, or Amber and a Trader, or Amber and Paragon himself... instead it comes out while Althea is sat down thinking about Vivacia. That might work, if it was written from Althea's point of view, but as it is you rather forget that you're even with her while you go on a five page foray into the woes of the Ludlucks.Mind you, I can see why it would be impossible to write this story from first person and still have it be a \"member of the cast\", so to speak, doing it. In Farseers, sometimes Fitz's ignorance of other events helped the story, and sometimes the fact that Fitz could Skill out to Molly, Burrich and Nettle and see them prevented it from hindering the story. But in Liveships there's no one central character: in the first book alone there's Althea, Brashen, Ronica, Keffria, Malta, Vivacia, Wintrow, Kennit, Kyle, Paragon, Amber, Maulkin, Shreever... and a range of locations from all corners of their world. There's no way any one of them could know the whole story -- indeed, so much of the story, especially the romantic conflicts, is based on that fact.Still, I think Hobb's writing shines best in first person. I also noticed that when I read the Tawny Man trilogy, I enjoyed that much more than Liveships. I'm not sure whether that was just the return to the familiar characters, or whether it was in a large part due to the return to a single point of view.CharactersThere are so many characters this trilogy follows. I couldn't even begin to list the main ones. They come in groups, in a way -- Bingtown Traders, Rain Wild Traders, pirates, serpents, Jamaillians -- yet those groups splinter and reform over and over again throughout the books. It isn't hard to follow exactly, but I do wonder if Hobb could have made readers care more about the characters had there been fewer, and had she kept the changes in viewpoint down. For example, you see from inside Malta in one section, and you see Malta from Ronica's eyes in the next -- it's jarring, to see so many sides to one character: not just implied, but \"said\" by the characters through third person (not actually very) limited.One of the common mistakes in writers, one of my books says, is to make characters too passive. They aren't interesting to read about. And there are far too many passive characters in Liveships, people who can't or won't take control of their own lives. For example, Wintrow -- in the end, he realises it, but for most of the books he refuses to accept and grow with his experiences, but only look backwards. Keffria is shown as spiritless, completely taken in by her husband, believing he's good and right when he's actually quite cruel. She only wants things to go back to where they were, she wants Kyle to take over things and leave her untouched by cares. It's hard to care about characters who are so passive, who do nothing to better their circumstances. They bring their misfortunes on themselves.On the other hand, there are the \"strong\" characters. They try to take their lives into their own hands, but without regard for others. Althea leaves her family when they need her, dividing it when they need to be strong, just to get what she wants. Malta doesn't care about the shame she might cause her family, or the hurt she might cause the men she flirts with and ensnares. She just wants to look beautiful and be adored. Tintaglia the dragon doesn't care about humans, even when they help her, but only about the fate of her own race.It's true that there are a few intriguing characters: Ronica, in particular, strikes me as a strong female character who wants the best for her family, for her home. She, most of all, considers everyone in Bingtown and pushes for everyone to unite. There are other intriguing characters, too: Amber, and Jek, and Shreever, but... they're often more minor characters, or in Amber's case, have to be slightly separate from the plot so it isn't too obvious who they really are.To me, there's a lack of a certain type of character we saw a lot of in the Farseer books: the Sacrifice. My favourite character in those was Verity, followed by Kettricken and then Fitz himself. They were still humans, with flaws, but in the end they pushed that aside to do what they had to do -- particularly Verity and Kettricken. In Liveships there is no single character who is willing to simply give him or herself up -- not through despair, but to bring hope to others. Nor do the characters have the sheer tenacity that Verity has. If they had to carve a dragon, I don't think they would continue as he did. Granted, perhaps the situation doesn't offer a chance for such a sacrifice, but it does seem as if in places, someone could simply do something instead of waiting, or trying to turn circumstances toward their own gain.The people in Liveships are like real people, (literally) warts and all. I wonder, though, if it isn't too realistic.Portrayal of WomenTo be a women in these books is to suffer. I don't think a single one of them escapes humiliation in some way. In contrast, the men escape lightly: in the course of the books, Serilla, for example, loses everything, but the Satrap gains more than he ever had (although admittedly suffering in the process); Althea loses so much, while Brashen only gains -- and Althea's gain of Brashen is portrayed as filling all the places in her life where she's lost, which troubles me. There's a general attitude in the men that women should be kept in the home, kept safe, and not let to do anything, because they can't. While the women in the books do manage things capably, it's always at a loss to themselves: Althea could marry Grag, but she would lose by doing so, so she doesn't, but she loses in not doing so, too. Malta takes control, but to do so she has to accept humiliation. Keffria learns to manage things, but knows that in doing so she loses her husband.In the end, they are all shown as strong in their ways, even Keffria. But things are heaped against them as they aren't against the men: it could be said that the society Hobb structures around them is what brings that upon them, but it still felt like a barrier to my reading than a natural part of the world.I've discussed a lot of ways the books could be more intriguing, with various people. More interesting characters, more of the interesting characters there already are -- starting in the Rain Wilds instead of taking so long to get there... I can see why it's written as it is, but with some tweaking to the plot to allow it to be written differently, I think these books could have been marvellous. I don't recommend reading them casually, but to fill out the details of the whole world in the Realm of the Elderlings cycle, I do recommend trying to push one's way through them. There are some lovely things in these books, but they're rather obscured, for me, by the things I've already mentioned."}, {"userName": "Katie Ziegler (Life Between Words)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17825291-katie-ziegler-life-between-words", "userReview": "Guys and Gals. I'm finally going to write a quick review. This fantasy trilogy is SO GOOD. A perfect blend of intricate world building, a rich plot, and most importantly fleshed out characters.One of the things I love about fantasy is that it is able to take true to life problems and injustices and put a fresh face to them. It allows the reader to step into these injustices and look at them more baldly because they are happening outside of our own world. It makes me think hard about my own preconceived notions and the real world I live in compared to the fantasy world I'm visiting. Sometimes the comparison is revealing and it's not always comfortable. Robin Hobb is a MASTER at this. Her Liveship trilogy deals with sexism, slavery, ownership, the powerful vs the powerless, valor and villainy and so much more. It's beautifully done. I love these characters - they constantly surprised me, angered me, and stole my heart. I am so sad to let them go. I am going to give an element of the story away here. Something that bothered me to my core, but I think it's important to mention. Stop reading if you absolutely don't want to know...There was a brutal rape (I'm telling you because you should know going in, in case it's something that you absolutely don't want to read about) that happens in the book that made me question whether to give the book 4 or 5 stars. It wasn't the event itself (I can't say I was particularly surprised, although I'd hoped to see the character involved have a redemption arc rather than just descend further into his psychopathy) - it was the aftermath. It was brushed under the rug by almost every other character and many didn't believe the victim that it actually happened. It infuriated me! BUT, the fact that it made me think so hard about what *should* have happened (and what so rarely happens in our own world) was very telling for me. I think it was very intentional on Robin Hobb's part. So five stars it is!"}, {"userName": "Dara", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13656026-dara", "userReview": "Signs of an excellent book: Keeps you up at night. Makes you forget your body's basic needs. Makes your vision blurry from reading it constantly. Relationships suffer because you ignore other people to read said book. All of this happened to me in the course of reading Ship of Destiny. I could not put this book down. For days, I was completely entranced by Robin Hobb's world. And I would not have it any other way.Ms. Hobb played my emotions like a fiddle. I felt like a marionette and she was holding the strings. She made me run the gamut from elation to sorrow to frustration to anger... everything. I was emotionally drained by the time I finished Ship of Destiny. Few series have made me care so much for the characters and their lives as Liveship Traders. I won't ever forget them and they'll always be dear to my heart. The plot was paced very well and wrapped up satisfactorily. It's not excessively neat but I didn't expect it to be. I saw things falling into places and pieced things together on my own but it was gratifying to see it all come together. There was political maneuvering, cool ship battles, romance, tragedy, comedy... a little bit of everything and all woven together so well. As always, Hobb's writing is exquisite. She is a master and a wizard and I adore her.If you've read Farseer and want to skip ahead to Tawny Man, don't do it. Stop and read this series first. It's magnificent and there are nuggets scattered throughout all 3 books for Farseer fans. I give this book....5 out of 5 stars.Series rating: 5 million stars.

Shall we continue?When we finally learned the full extent of the flashbacks despite all the previous not-so-subtle hints..when THAT scene happened..All the other near-hits..Then there is the light at the end of the tunnel, when you see all the wonderful marvelous character development and how characters you started off hating with a raging fire ended being some of your favorites, but also the exact opposite can also happen, and that just proves how masterful Robin Hobb is in creating those realistic yet highly flawed personalities. I mentioned how we see immense growth throughout the series yet it all felt as a part of a natural course and none of it really felt forced in any way shape or form.*wipes brow* those books people, everyone should pick up Robin Hobb especially if you are like me who inhales dragons and exhales magic. And no, it's NOT ok to skip Farseer and just start with this trilogy, or at least do it at your own risk knowing that you'll only have half the experience, an awesome experience for sure, but a truncated one nonetheless because: A. you'll miss you on Fitz and the Fool and Burrich and Patience and Kettricken and all the merry band in the Six Duchies, despite it being majorly flawed pace-wise with a very rushed ending, if you looked at it as a part of a gigantic series you won't even feel disappointed by the super slow burn, it'll make the experience richer and more vivid every time you dive into one of her masterpieces. I cannot in good conscience say that I loved the characters in Liveships Traders or the plot more that the ones in Farseer, the only superiority I saw was in the structure of Liveships Traders and the feeling that Robin Hobb was more at ease with her world and prose that she didn't feel she needed to go on and on about useless details or insignificant happenings or just wandering around in the forest. The multiple POV certainly helps, but aside from that I equally love both trilogies when it comes to the things that matters (characteeeeeerrrrrrrrrss)B. I gotta be honest, I saw fanart that kinda hinted at a big reveal in this trilogy that wasn't even revealed but was heavily alluded to, and you wouldn't even understand how big it is without reading the first trilogy, but OH MY GOD!

I need to sit and dwell on the series then I will review. I'm actually a little sad, not because of how it ended, but because I was so engrossed in the story that I don't want to come back to reality. I want to stay aboard the ship. ***********************************************************Updated Review - Review of all three books in the Robin Hobb The Liveship Traders Trilogy 3 Books Collection Set.I've read the The Farseer Trilogy and throughout the years since I read it parts of the story would keep coming back to me and I couldn't quite remember what book I was recalling it from. Then I would remember it was the Farseer Trilogy and think \"I must re-read that someday.\" That is how this latest trilogy, Liveship Traders, will stay with me as well.I don't think there was anywhere in the trilogy where the story lagged in any way. I was never bored, never skipped sections and unless interrupted by my kids, did not re-read any sentences or paragraphs. Each chapter was engrossing. Each chapter ended with a cliffhanger moment that made you want to skip ahead to find out what happens, but the next chapter was just as good that you forgot all about skipping ahead. The point of views throughout the books changed often and while I like stories told from one or two point of views, there was so much going on and so many connections in this story that I actually enjoyed the multiple POV's. I was so invested in each of the characters that I wanted to hear each and every one of their points of view. Robin Hobb did not disappoint and the various POV's ran seamlessly together never leaving a gap or leaving you stumped. On the edge of your seat? Questioning? Yes, absolutely. Every unanswered question gets answered; every piece of the puzzle comes together nicely at the end. When I started this series I wasn't sure how I would feel about reading a story of ships but it was that and so much more. I commend Robin Hobb on her writing. It is so detailed but no overly so that you become lost. She writes like your eyes see things if that makes any sense. It's like watching a movie when you read her books. I even heard the exciting music you hear in movies (LOL) during some of the scenes and goosebumps broke out on my arms. The little details that I think many authors overlook, like how the rain washes over their faces and brings their hair to points on their head, drips running from their eyelashes and chin. Amazing. The other thing I loved about this book; when you think that you know how it's going to end, Robin Hobb takes you in another unexpected direction. You think it's going to be predictable and it's not. Oh, and there are dragons. Very cool dragons and a buried city where once dragons reigned.The book begins by introducing you to the little town of Bingtown and the Vestrit family. The Vestrits are Traders and have been for a long time. They trade with the River Wilds and their family ship, a Liveship, originates from the River Wilds. The Vestrit's ship has not yet quickened. The ship does not quicken until three generations have died on their decks and along with their deaths, their memories. Althea Vestrit's father, Ephron, is the captain of the Vivacia and the third generation. Althea has been raised on the ship alongside her father and has a strong connection to the family ship. The story starts with Ephron's death and the quickening of Vivacia. Quickening in a short sense is the figurehead on the ship coming alive. The Liveships can only be guided with a member of their family on board and so it is that Althea believes she will be the next captain of her family ship. Only that is not how it goes. It is then that you are taken on a very long journey that weaves through the lives of many and connecting them all in a way that can only be destiny.I could not possibly outline every aspect of the story that follows, even if I were to do it in short snippets. First, it would do it no justice and second the story is too long and so good you need to read it for yourself, if you haven't already. The books cover a rather short period of time, maybe 2-3 years from my interpretation. I absolutely cared about almost every character and even the ones I despised (not because of the writing but because of their portrayal), I still was completely invested in each of them. My list of characters I despised is not a long one. I despised Kyle Haven. Not much else to say there, you will agree with me if you read the book or you will agree with me when you read the book. Towards the end, I despised the pirate, Captain Kennit. Kennit and I had a love/hate relationship. While he had some qualities and made decisions I didn't like, for the most part I understood him and somewhere deep down I felt there was good in him and I liked him. Then he does something that made me hate him and I couldn't wait for him to meet his end. Luck was on his side it seemed for a long time but it caught up with him eventually. Finally the Satrap Cosgo I really didn't like but again, not because of the writing or anything the author did. I didn't like him, a whiny, weak, child of a man which is exactly what the author intended for that character. Well done.The rest of the characters (in no particular order), Althea, Brashen, Wintrow, Etta, Ronica, Keffria, Grag, Amber, Paragon, Vivacia, Tintaglia, Reyn, Jani, Selden, Malta, Sorcor and all the other fine people in this story, I adored and I will miss them. This was the kind of book that you wanted to just keep going so you could live their lives. I want to keep reading to see where their lives will take them, but I can't and as they say all good stories must come to an end. While this came to an end for me, it will live long in my memory. Even a re-read I am not sure would be as good as the first time around, where everything was unknown and captivating. The only negative I could find with this book, and I use the term negative loosely, were the serpents and their tangle. The serpents in the beginning and at least through the first book, maybe the second, I didn't entirely understand what they were doing, what their terminology meant (the Lack and the Plenty) and what their purpose in the story was. Sometimes, when I got to the chapters with their POV's I felt less engaged in the book. I blame that on my lack of understanding. By the end, however, it all fit together nicely and it all made sense and takes away from the negative I found in the beginning book. Truly, this was the only negative I could find.Well, that about wraps up my review. I could keep sitting here typing all the things I loved about this story and about the writing. However, I find myself a little melancholy as I come to grips that the story is over and I need to let these characters dissolve in my memory. Truly grateful that these three books grace my shelves. I will be reading a lot more of Robin's books."}, {"userName": "Scott  Hitchcock", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50894754-scott-hitchcock", "userReview": "All three books in the series 4.5*'s.

What made it even more heartbreaking is that no one believed her. From that point on in the book I had to force myself to finish it and I managed to. But the ending wasn't satisfying. It felt rushed and sloppy and out of character, especially for my aforementioned favourite who abandones her lifelong ambition in favor of marrying and standing by her man, the idea of which she abhorred in previous novels.But the ending really doesn't do justice to this terrific series.

Top moment from this series TBH. This sounds silly and is possibly because I read too much YA, but well-conceived, slow-burn plot twists do not dominate my reading. I need to change this.- Kennit as a missing Ludluck was pretty good. But ultimately, this ties into my main issue with the novel's conclusion ....- I hated, loathed, absolutely despised the Althea/Kennit rape plot. I normally avoid sexual violence in books altogether, but the violence presented in the trilogy is so equally meted out that it felt like an intrinsic part of the world, rather than a gratuitous add-on. This is where it crossed the line for me. There's the usual \"can she ever love again?\" shit that I would have rather had removed (if you need conflict between Brashen and Althea, there are 100 other ways to create it), the problems with no one believing Althea, and this crazy arc around Kennit's sociopathy tying into the reveal of Kennit as a Ludluck. To have Althea's rape be the event that reveals Kennit's true colors just felt contrived and not particularly imaginative. It sucked the enjoyment out of the last part of the book. I feel ambivalent about Kennit as the engine of the trilogy, actually, because there's this very depressing arc that shows him abused as a child > throwing his pain into Paragon > living to become the monster. I respect Hobb's characterization and I think this could have gone very wrong in another author's hands: are we supposed to feel sorry for Kennit? I don't. It's the arc of the flawed man never realizing the Love He Has (Etta!) pushing forward the entire plot. It's just not that great to look back and realize you're reading this arc that almost veers into trope, and then at the end you're betrayed even further into that trope with Althea's rape. So, not great. I loved reading his sections because, again, Hobb can write characters well, but I'm left with a slightly sour taste in my mouth at the conclusion of the series.- Loved, loved, loved Malta's continual transformation in this book, her relationship with the Satrap, and the eventual reveal of the Reyn/Malta deformities as dragon-born. I'd read several more books about them at court. I still think Malta's character evolved too quickly in book 2, but I was HERE for Malta in book 3.- Althea and Brashen won me over despite myself. People that will never win me over: Wintrow. BYE. I also question keeping Kyle around long enough to have him murdered on the deck of the ship, but w/e my feelings about this aren't strong enough, really.- Another missing piece: could we get into WTF was going on with Amber in all three books? Is there some sort of companion series I've missed that could explain this to me? (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Shelby M.

Trigger warning for rape."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45400990-laura", "userReview": "A great conclusion to a wonderful trilogy.I loved the development of the characters, especially that of Malta; I loved the liveships and the wonderful description of their journey towards self-discovery, especially that of Paragon. I loved the dragon and the rain wilders and I'm looking forward to more of their adventures.I was greatly surprised to discover here another facet of the Fool. Or maybe this was his true image after all. Hobb's writing is so brilliant that I only managed to put all of it together in this last book.I didn't particularly like the part about what happened to Althea. The way she reacted, the way Vivacia reacted to it as well as the way Althea's relationship with Brashen and Paragon continued, it all seemed a little unrealistic to me. That's why I only gave it 4 stars.All in all I loved it and even though I was a little dissapointed with some of the things in the end, I still find it a brilliant trilogy."}, {"userName": "Mark Harrison", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56368159-mark-harrison", "userReview": "Absolute joy to read this series. Any plot points would spoil the earlier books but there are pirates, dragons, sea serpents, love stories, heartbreaking losses, a beautiful twist to tie in the Fitz series and a breathtaking number of amazing characters. All of them have long journeys, good guys go bad, horrible characters change and the strong women in the Vesterit family knit everything together. Loved this so much - without question one of my favourite series of all time and gutted I will never read it for the first time again."}, {"userName": "Damian Dubois", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3481936-damian-dubois", "userReview": "Brilliant, brilliant, brilliant. My favourite of the three Hobb trilogies I've read to date and even better the second time through them all.

Althea's rape seemed so out of left field. Yes, it showed how his own abuse poisoned him, and helped frame Paragon's insanity, but I felt like he did something so wretched, so against his own plans of the future, just so when he died we maybe would feel it was a positive? Was she writing him too sympathetically and she needed to show he was still at heart a villain? Still, where he contemplates his own unborn child and sees a future where he would most certainly pass the abuse on, was chilling.
