The cultures that have developed are rather pragmatic about survival (creches where children must prove themselves by a certain age or become food), though not entirely without morality (after all, our protagonist's culture doesn't actually eat criminals when there's not a famine; only barbarians do that).A richly developed world, with interesting cultural and societal developments."}, {"userName": "ambyr", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2670408-ambyr", "userReview": "So on the one hand: the writing is turgid, the pacing is bizarre, and the political lecturing interminable. Also there is cannibalism (did I mention the cannibalism?) on almost every page. Spousal abuse and child rape both make appearances and are treated as the unexceptional actions of reasonable people.And on the other hand: I loved this book.Partly it's the culture. (Or cultures. Geta is not a monoculture, and its clans' beliefs frequently clash.) Courtship Rite is more \"here, let me show you my worldbuilding\" than it is a novel, but it rarely falls prey to \"As you know, Bob\" exposition dumps. It lets its culture reveal itself organically from character interactions. That culture is profoundly weird--quite possibly one of the weirdest I've encountered in science fiction, and that includes non-humanoid ones--and includes a lot of moral and ethical norms that make me cringe, but it's internally consistent enough that I believe the characters think they're doing right even when I think they're committing terrible wrongs. And despite those terrible wrongs, I love the characters, especially the women. (Teenae! Noe!) I'm not entirely clear what this novel thinks it's doing with gender--it has this weird mix of sexist norms and broad gender equality that I think is one of the least well-thought-out aspects of the culture--but as individuals its female characters are pretty awesome. And I don't mean that in some sort of generic action hero way; each of the women (and men) is in fact a clearly distinct individual, with her own strengths and flaws. (And, in most cases, her own scientific specialty. One is a physicist, one is a biologist, and one is a mathematician.)More impressively, I don't just buy them as individuals, I buy them as spouses. There's a saying in poly circles that a triad isn't one relationship, it's four--each pair as well as the three together. It follows that a quartet is eleven, a quintet twenty-five, and . . . I'm not going to keep doing the combinations, because I am not Teenae. At its heart, this novel is about the formation of an eight-party relationship, and while it doesn't manage to develop every possible relationship within that marriage it gives it a noble attempt. By the end of the book, I understand how the core five function together (as pairs, as triads, and even as quartets) and even believe the expanded marriage has a shot. That's frankly more than I can say about a lot of books' dyadic relationships.I'm a little weirded out by the book's relentless heterosexuality--there are no gay people on Geta? At all?--but I do appreciate the lack of performative bisexuality by women, which is a place it would have been easy for it to have gone. And I definitely appreciate that all characters of both genders are equally enthused about sex and their marriage.In conclusion: if you are interested in poly relationships and not bothered by cannibalism or bad writing, I highly recommend this book. But I suspect I am part of a rather small target audience."}, {"userName": "Sheherazahde", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6072951-sheherazahde", "userReview": "Courtship Rite takes place on a human colony world, Geta, that has forgotten it is a colony. Their legends tell them \"God\" brought them across the stars to protect them from \"war\", and \"God\" still watches over them from the sky. We learn later that their word for \"God\" was the original colonists word for \"ship\", and the colony ship does indeed still orbit above them.The only source of protein the colonists have are bees and human flesh, so cannibalism is common and accepted. They also practice genetic engineering. The story follows one family of three half brothers and their wives. The men share a common father and were raised in a public creche where any failure would result in death. They married a young girl from a clan that specializes in math and a spoiled rich girl of their own clan. Their clan specializes in government. They are about to marry a scientist when they are ordered by their clan leader to marry a woman from a coastal clan who advocates heretical beliefs, such as evolution and not killing people for food. They decide to use the \"Courtship Rite\", where they try to kill her several times and if she lives they will marry her. Since she doesn't know them or want to marry them this is bit unfair to her, but they were a angry about the order and it is the central motivation of the plot. [return] They also have to deal with a clan of clone women who make their living as courtesans, and clan of seafarers who want to rule the coastal area.This is my favorite kind of Science Fiction: religion, politics, social engineering, and philosophy. By an author who does it all very well. I give it 5 out of 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Terence", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence", "userReview": "I just can't get into this book. Perhaps it's that the writing is \"harsh\" and \"clunky,\" at least to my mental ear. There are points where a character says something and I'm jarred out of the scene, asking \"huh?\" Perhaps it's the characters, of whom I like or care for none.It's a shame for two reasons: One, the world (Geta) is potentially fascinating. A harsh world, most of whose flora and fauna is poisonous to human life. A situation that has forced the development of ritual cannibalism, and lives conditioned by the harsh needs for survival. Secondly, Kingsbury's Psychohistorical Crisis remains one of my favorite novels and I had high hopes for this one.If I didn't have more interesting-looking books on my to-read shelf, I might have stuck with this one but I don't want to continue to waste my time here."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/905038-dianne", "userReview": "This is one of the better alternative societies created for a science fiction book.

Cependant, il serait r\u00e9ellement r\u00e9ducteur de le positionner comme une simple copie du roman de Herbert, car Parade nuptiale est un r\u00e9cit beaucoup plus riche, plus fort, et plus difficile d\u2019acc\u00e8s que Dune. Ce r\u00e9cit se situe sur une plan\u00e8te autre que la Terre, o\u00f9 des humains luttent pour survivre dans un monde \u00e0 l\u2019hostilit\u00e9 av\u00e9r\u00e9e. En effet, loin de monstres g\u00e9ants, la biosph\u00e8re de cette plan\u00e8te est naturellement toxique pour l\u2019\u00eatre humain, et les aliments dits profanes, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire ceux issus de cette biosph\u00e8re, sont potentiellement mortels, \u00e0 la mani\u00e8re du plomb, pour les humains. Il existe bien s\u00fbr quelques aliments dits sacr\u00e9s, pour lesquels le lecteur devine qu\u2019ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 import\u00e9s avec ces humains, comme le bl\u00e9 ou les patates. Partant de cette hypoth\u00e8se tr\u00e8s simple, Kingsburry se place d\u2019entr\u00e9e de jeu dans ce qu\u2019on pourait appeler un r\u00e9gime stable, c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire longtemps apr\u00e8s la colonisation. Et son postulat d\u2019environnement toxique a des r\u00e9percussions incroyables sur la culture et la soci\u00e9t\u00e9 de cette plan\u00e8te, retomb\u00e9e dans ce que je consid\u00e8re comme une esp\u00e8ce de moyen\u00e2ge, o\u00f9 existerait pourtant la g\u00e9n\u00e9tique moderne. Parmi les cons\u00e9quences les plus \u00e9videntes, on peut citer le cannibalisme culturel. C\u2019est-\u00e0-dire que les plus faibles sont \u00e9limin\u00e9es en cas de famine, pour nourir de leurs prot\u00e9ines les plus forts, et ainsi participer \u00e0 l\u2019am\u00e9lioration de la race, concept cl\u00e9 de cette plan\u00e8te. De la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re, les anciens qui meurent de vieillesse, les difformes et les b\u00e9b\u00e9s non d\u00e9sir\u00e9s sont tous mang\u00e9s, et on conserve les parties de leur corps non d\u00e9vor\u00e9es lors du buffet fun\u00e9raire dans de d\u00e9licieuses conserves. Tout cela n\u2019est qu\u2019un des milliers d\u2019aspects o\u00f9 l\u2019environnement a eu son impact sur la culture et la civilisation de ce monde. Tout cela n\u2019est qu\u2019un environnement dont j\u2019ai essay\u00e9 de donner un aper\u00e7u des pratiques les plus marquantes. Et dans cet environnement, ce roman nous raconte l\u2019ascencion d\u2019une famille (un mariage polygame visant la compl\u00e9tude \u00e0 sept) qui va essayer de prendre le pouvoir, de mani\u00e8re \"civilis\u00e9e\", c\u2019est-\u00e0-dire sans verser le sang et en respectant les coutumes politiques. Et toute cette lutte politique pr\u00e9sente, pour le joueur de nomic que je suis, certains aspects tr\u00e8s int\u00e9ressants comme une r\u00e9flexion approfondie sur le pouvoir, son exercice et sa fonction sociale. Ainsi, la mise en oeuvre d\u2019un \u00e9lectorat sur la base du client\u00e9lisme, qu\u2019on consid\u00e8re usuellement comme une mauvaise forme de gouvernement, est ici utilis\u00e9 d\u2019une mani\u00e8re extr\u00eamement int\u00e9ressante, qui en sublime les potentialit\u00e9s politiques. En fait, il est difficile de bien parler d\u2019une oeuvre aussi radicalement diff\u00e9rente. Car la diff\u00e9rence, ici, n\u2019est pas seulement dans les v\u00eatements ou les pratiques religieuses de gens, elle est dans le coeur de leur culture, qui se base enti\u00e8rement sur la cannibalisme. Et ce cannibalisme, \u00e0 son tour, ne peut pas \u00eatre vu comme un acte d\u00e9gradant. Ou du moins, il n\u2019est vu comme tel que par une gentille h\u00e9r\u00e9tique, qui souhaite y mettre fin, et dont le r\u00f4le dans le bouquin est assez important. Au final, c\u2019est effectivement une lecture tr\u00e8s \u00e9trange, mais assez fascinante. Je ne saurais trop conseiller aux fans de fictions \u00e9llabor\u00e9es de se pr\u00e9cipiter sur cet ouvrage o\u00f9 l\u2019action laisse bien volontiers la place \u00e0 de puissantes r\u00e9flexions sur la soci\u00e9t\u00e9, la politique, le pouvoir, ce genre de choses.  Une discussion sur ce roman Peu de temps apr\u00e8s, j\u2019ai eu l\u2019occasion de discuter de ce roman avec un interlocuteur d\u2019Usenet, qu\u2019on appelera ici XH. NDParce que des cannibales qui se lancent dans une guerre tribale pour \u00e9tendre leur empire, \u00e7a fait sf, comme th\u00e8me ? XHNon ; mais la question de savoir si une soci\u00e9t\u00e9 fonctionnelle issue d\u2019un peuplement originellement humain mais qui a d\u00e9riv\u00e9 \u00e0 tel point que tout les crit\u00e8res sociaux habituellement admis ont vol\u00e9 en \u00e9clat est encore compos\u00e9e d\u2019humains, n\u2019est-ce pas SF, comme th\u00e8me ? NDSi, compl\u00e8tement. il n\u2019en reste pas moins que, dans ce roman, certains \u00e9l\u00e9ments (les combats tribaux, l\u2019esp\u00e8ce de m\u00e9di\u00e9valisme que j\u2019ai pu y ressentir) me font penser que le classement en SF est quelque part un peu artificiel. Pour ma part, si j\u2019avais d\u00fb placer ce roman quelque part, je l\u2019aurais mis dans une nouvelle cat\u00e9gorie : la hard-\u201dsciences humaines\u201d. Car si, dans les bouquins d\u2019Egan, par exemple, les \u00e9l\u00e9ments qui sont tr\u00e8s largement extrapol\u00e9s sont des \u00e9l\u00e9ments de sciences dures, Kingsburry, lui, choisit d\u2019extrapoler de la m\u00eame mani\u00e8re des \u00e9l\u00e9ments purement humains : comment survivre et adapter la civilsation \u00e0 un environnement dont l\u2019hostilit\u00e9 est on ne peut plus hostile. Il en tire ainsi des cons\u00e9quences politiques, sociales, psychologiques, qui ne peuvent que laisser le lecteur sans voix. XHC\u2019est parce que tu es trop conditionn\u00e9 par l\u2019association entre SF et technologie. Alors que la SF est un \u00e9tat d\u2019esprit que tu \u00e9voques fort bien dans la suite [... cf paragraphe du dessus \u2026] Le tout ficel\u00e9 dans une histoire int\u00e9ressante. Voil\u00e0 une bonne recette pour un bon bouquin de SF, je dirais. L\u2019important, ce n\u2019est pas la technique, c\u2019est la remise en cause des certitudes et la rationnalit\u00e9 (m\u00eame bas\u00e9e sur des bases qui peuvent \u00eatre compl\u00e8tement farfelues scientifiquement, l\u2019important \u00e9tant que cet a priori soit relativement clair). Bref, la SF cherche \u00e0 explorer et d\u00e9couvrir le r\u00e9el, le plus souvent au travers de virtualit\u00e9s savamment \u00e9labor\u00e9es, tandis que la fantasy joue plus sur comment faire revivre les structures narratives ancestrales et leurs \u00e9motions associ\u00e9es dans un contexte litt\u00e9raire modernis\u00e9. Cela dit, c\u2019est mon point de vue et je le partage (du moins jusqu\u2019\u00e0 ceje le relise demain), mais sans doute manqu\u00e9-je de biscuits (comme disait mon prof de philo de terminale), i.e je n\u2019ai pas mon dipl\u00f4me de pipologie appliqu\u00e9e, euh pardon, de critique litt\u00e9raire avanc\u00e9e. Notons au passage que Kingsburry a obtenu l\u2019an dernier une distinction en tant qu\u2019auteur de SF libertaire, ce qui cadre bien avec cet esprit de remise en question. NDEn fait, il n\u2019y a pas non plus de doute pour moi, mais \u00e7a reste un bouquin tellement \u00e9trange que le placer en sf me pose de nombreux probl\u00e8mes d\u2019organisation de mon catalogue mental. XHFranchement, je trouve que c\u2019est un des bouquins que je conseillerais pour quelqu\u2019un qui voudrait d\u00e9couvrir la SF autrement que sous la forme de batailles dans l\u2019espace avec des robots. Le seul truc queje regrette, c\u2019est la concession qu\u2019il fait en faisant trop directement r\u00e9f\u00e9rence \u00e0 l\u2019histoire du XXe si\u00e8cle, je trouve que cela affaiblit l\u2019effet de d\u00e9paysement. Mais en m\u00eame temps cela sert aussi l\u2019histoire,et la r\u00e9f\u00e9rence est imm\u00e9diatement compr\u00e9hensible, voire m\u00eame ressentie par lecteur, bien plus que le seraient des inventions de l\u2019auteur."}, {"userName": "John Park", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17831138-john-park", "userReview": "A recent reread after a couple of decades. I found I'd forgotten all the plot and some of the setting. Geta is a far-future, mostly desert world precariously colonised by humans, who have no other surviving vertebrates (the Horse is known only as a chesspiece) and so must be their own source of meat protein, through ritual cannibalism. The biosciences are well developed, but physics is also making progress as the story develops. Kingsbury employs the traditional assumption that such a civilisation will have deified what it can no longer understand--and indeed the Getans have their own God who crosses the sky at regular intervals. This God, almost certainly the starship that brought them to Geta and now left in a parking orbit, remains enigmatic to the end of the book--evidently grist for a sequel that Kingsbury has never published.What he gives us is a fascinating portrayal of a culture of world-wide clans specialised in various talents. Marriages can consists of two to six spouses (though the free and often joyous couplings Kingsbury presents are all heterosexual), but are apt to be influenced by political pressures. The main plot engine of the book is started when a five-member marriage, having chosen a third woman to complete their six, are told that for political reasons they must take another, a stranger.Political intrigue intersects with personal needs and clan morality. Characters grow and change, war is threatened, stories of Earth's violent past are recovered and overinterpreted, A biological weapon threatens famine. Catastrophe is averted. Conflicts are resolved, loose ends tied off.The writing clunks occasionally; some of the dialogue feels too oratorical, and the last fifty-odd pages are perhaps an epilogue rather than part of the main story. But the book contains a wealth of invention in the setting, plot and character. Perhaps the best indication of the care that must have gone into it are the invented quotations used as chapter-epigraphs; like the book itself they are by turns deliberately naive, satirical, wise, sad, funny, harsh, and always thought-provoking."}, {"userName": "Kyle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38628830-kyle", "userReview": "Easily the best book about the political machinations on a planet filled with polyfidelitous cannibals that you'll ever read. Life on Geta is harsh--the mostly-desert environment means the only animal life around is insectoid, so the only source of labor or meat is other humans. And to make matters worse, all but eight \"sacred\" plants are poisonous to humans. This gives rise to a very specific set of social institutions where cannibalism is seen as perfectly acceptable in certain situations and is often even an act of noble sacrifice. It also means the lack of trees and fossil fuels have kept technology to a level roughly equivalent with that found immediately prior to the industrial revolution. But there are hints, especially strong in the religious traditions that are passed down from generation to generation, that there was a time of more advanced technological progress.The characters are vibrant and the numerous complex plot lines interweave to form a rich, fascinating tapestry.

If I had to give the review in one word: fascinating.The only information I had about this book when I began was a) the author (whom I did not recognize) b) the publication year and c) its nomination (and lack of award) for the Hugo. I recommend reading this without knowing much more, and I'll give the kind of review that won't spoil it for others. More intriguing than any murder or detective mystery I've ever read is the puzzle of determining this book's genre. As I progressed through the chapters, I couldn't decide, but I was mesmerized by the challenge. Is it a fantasy world? Are the characters human? Is it an alternate history? Far future science fiction? Dystopia? It was a remarkably engaging reading experience. I was further impressed by the depth and detail of the social and political life portrayed. Whether it be set in the past, future, or some other universe, this was society organized around a very different set of values; the conflicts, shame, outrage, and adventure were then governed by the rules of this created world. I felt as immersed in this world as I have been with epic series such as The Song of Ice and Fire and The Wheel of Time - all the more astounding because Kingsbury put me there with a single book of 409 pages. More laurels are certainly deserved, but equally noteworthy are the facets that kept this from being one of my favorite books of all time. First, it was a somewhat difficult read. Because Kingsbury is building a very alien world, and because its true identity is only gradually revealed, the book starts out in very unfamiliar territory and you rapidly have to familiarize yourself with scores of peculiar proper nouns while accepting that much of what is going on is supposed to be opaque. This was a necessary and worthwhile trade off in my estimation, but not every reader is going to happily trudge through to rapprochement. It also made for a slow read. Second, Kingsbury relied on a lot of shock devices. The author presents and develops as normal social conventions many practices that are grotesque and perverse. I don't think the repulsive ideas were there simply as cheap entertainment (okay, maybe the pervasive sex was); I'll give him credit for pushing the reader to consider why our society considers some behaviors civilized and others barbaric. Still, it was hardly a book you can go discussing with your mother. Third, for all the worldbuilding, Kingsbury seems to have petered out when it came to the courtship rite for which the book is named. This was (or should have been) the organizing device for the tale, but it got lost somewhere, and the care and design so obvious in the rest of the book was strikingly absent here. I'm not as well-read with fantasy as I am with science fiction, thus perhaps this isn't as original as it appeared to me.

They have developed a bizarre culture that glorifies pain and suffering (elaborate scarification is normative, and the \"courtship rite\" is in fact an elaborate death trial), polygamy (logical enough, perhaps, in a depleted environment where reproduction would be difficult), and cannibalism--perhaps the novel's most unsettling element is the bland reference to such things as roast babies. Nevertheless, the characters are not savages or primitive; they have some advanced technology, including some that allows complex genetic engineering, cloning, and machine breeding, though they also lack other things we'd expect (e.g. radio and wheeled vehicles are reinvented in the novel). Most interestingly, they are complex figures with plausible and different motivations, and belonging to clearly etched different cultural groups. Weakened by some clunky writing and a plot that meanders, but a superlative example of world-building."}, {"userName": "Mark Schomburg", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1776553-mark-schomburg", "userReview": "The heavy tone is worth savoring, especially given the food discussion which is cannibalistic. I found this fantasy world comparable to stuff by various writers ranging from RA Salvatore or Clive Barker to even Asimov. The \"psychohistorical\" connection here is that society is structured around \"Predictors,\" a major theme which resonates pretty strongly with Asimov's Foundation series, albeit in a very different way. The writing is adult and sometimes explicit which sets it apart from Salvatore to some degree. Kingsbury does not curtail his need to express difficult social themes by imposing an external morality. The work is true from within - a valid world, not unlike something by Huxley, with its flaws and nuances clear for all to see. That uninhibited range gives the book great depth. The plot development has much in common with sci-fi of the 70s in how the fantasy world's nebulous connection to Earth history is revealed (but not pinned down). We start on a strange planet and gradually (through ambience) begin to find where we are, a well-tread method which also works here, but dates the book, which would otherwise feel more eternal."}, {"userName": "Daniorte", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28707139-daniorte", "userReview": "La novela parte de una idea original. La historia de una civilizaci\u00f3n surgida de una nave seminal proveniente de la tierra.

With few exceptions, most of the genre isn't worth reading except as escapist literature and I never attended much to quality, simply reading almost anything to hand except when burned enough by a particularly bad writer to avoid him or her.This isn't a bad book.

Courtship Rite is a sf novel by American writer Donald Kingsbury, originally serialized in Analog magazine in 1982. The book is set in the same universe as some of his other stories, such as Shipwright (1978) & the unpublished The Finger Pointing Solward. In the UK, the novel was entitled Geta, in France, Parade nuptiale. Courtship Rite was the 1st winner of the Compton Crook Award for best 1st novel & was nominated for the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1983. The novel details the attempts of two of the priest-clans, the Kaiel & the Mnankrei, to expand into territory controlled by the Stgal. Ultimately, all the priest clans are trying to attain dominance of the planet through the use of new technology, propaganda, treachery & \"war\", a new concept in this world. Previously, killing was done merely in order to provide food. Jo Walton remarked that Courtship Rite \"is about a distant generation of colonists on a planet with no usable animals. This is the book with everything, where everything includes cannibalism, polyamory, evolution & getting tattoos so your skin will make more interesting leather when you\u2019re dead.\"", "title": "Courtship Rite", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/753136.Courtship_Rite", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1286425438l/753136.jpg", "reviews": 31, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/127931.Donald_Kingsbury", "name": "Donald Kingsbury"}], "type": ["Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Fantasy", "Polyamory"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/753136.Courtship_Rite", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3215002-courtship-rite", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7391761-courtship-rite", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3628871-parade-nuptiale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18248785-rito-de-cortejo", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8467506-courtship-rite", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2519823.Geta", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1518819.Psychohistorical_Crisis", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/812056.The_Moon_Goddess_and_the_Son", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6524501-psychohistoire-en-p-ril-i", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6524500-psychohistoire-en-p-ril-ii", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/378692.Man_Kzin_Wars_IV", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
