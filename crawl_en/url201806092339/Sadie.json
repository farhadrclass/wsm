Mattie was murdered, her body left just outside her hometown of Cold Creek, Colorado. Sadie is missing, her car found, abandoned, thousands of miles away, with all her personal belongings still inside it. The girls\u2019 surrogate grandmother, May Beth Foster, has enlisted my help in finding Sadie and bringing her home.For those of you just tuning in, this is a serialized podcast, so if you haven\u2019t listened to our first episode, you should do that now. We have more story than time to tell it - but I suppose that\u2019s true for all of us.this book is such a ballpunch. i don\u2019t even have balls, but i felt it - the sharp whitehot flashes of sudden impact; boof, boof, boof, followed by a deep nausea.courtney summers is gonna ballpunch all of you. this book\u2019s got some things in common with The Female of the Species and Are You Sleeping, but it has a ferocity all its own, and as much as i loved the fierce energy of The Female of the Species, with its teengirl vigilantism and Hard Candy revenge-killings, Sadie is much darker and more realistic, which makes it much, much scarier. and if there are still any adults out there who think they are 'too grown' for YA books, think again, because although this is targeted at a teen audience, the quality of summers\u2019 writing is better than many adult-market books i\u2019ve read, and she doesn\u2019t pull any of those punches - they hit and hit hard. there are two narrative voices: the rawnerve howl of nineteen-year-old sadie, on the trail of the man she believes killed her thirteen-year-old sister mattie, and west mccray - the creator of the podcast The Girls, whose contributions are mostly in the form of transcripts from that podcast, with all the rounded-edged detached professional compassion of an NPR host. sadie has zero rounded edges left. all she has is a car, a backpack, some cash, and a plan:\u201dShe\u2019s dead,\u201d I whisper and I don\u2019t know why this is the thing I choose to say out loud because it hurts to say it, to feel the truth of those words pass my lips, to have them be real in this world. But She\u2019s dead is the reason I\u2019m still alive.She\u2019s dead is the reason I\u2019m going to kill a man.sadie dropped out of school at sixteen to raise her sister after their addict-mother left, both of their fathers long out of the picture, and she struggled for years to make ends meet with her truncated education and severe stutter in a small-town trailer park full of bad memories and no prospects for the future.For some people, the future ahead is opportunity. For others, it\u2019s only time you haven\u2019t met and where I lived, it was only time. You don\u2019t waste your breath trying to protect it. You just try to survive it until one day, you don\u2019t.what she did have was her devotion to mattie, and with mattie gone, she\u2019s got nothing left to lose and she\u2019s a mama-bear incandescent with vengeance. i'll say no more, but oh, man, this is a powerhouse of a book. it'll getcha.***************************************might bump this up to five stars - gotta let it all settle. review to come, but in short: magnificent.***************************************it's here!***************************************Congratulations karen!You are one of our Giveaways lucky winners!

It will pull no punches, and even when you finish it, you will not have any peace of mind. You will be left haunted by it, as I currently am right now and will most likely be for a while.Courtney Summers' name being attached to any project has me a hundred percent on board, no questions asked. I've always been awed by her work, namely the zombie thriller This is Not a Test and the brutally realistic All the Rage. These two books in particular are part of my all time favorite YA novels. So you could imagine my elation when my NetGalley request was accepted. I didn't waste any time starting.The book is told in a unique way, alternating between chapters from Sadie's point of view, detailing her quest to seek vengeance for her little sister, and also transcripts from the radio show called The Girls, hosted by a man named West McCray (sidebar, he's gay\u2014this doesn't have any relevance or bearing to the story, I just appreciated the fact) who is desperate to find Sadie and figure out what happened to her.I can get technical and review this the way a professional would, but you know that's not how I roll. I review books by talking about how they made me feel, so that's what I'm going to do.The misconception I had, and I'm sure most people will have, about this book is I went into it thinking this will be a story about hatred and revenge. And in some ways, it's true. Sadie's hatred for the person who ruined her life and her desire to kill him is what drives the story initially. You want to root for her as she follows trail after trail, you want her to find this disgusting man and rip him apart and find some satisfaction in that.But as I finished reading, somewhat struggling to see the text on the screen due to the blurriness of my eyes welling up with tears, I realized how wrong I was. This book is about love.Here is Sadie, a young girl who has lost everything and went through awful, unforgivable things in her childhood, had a mother who neglected and abandoned her. All the love and light left in her life was her little sister Mattie, and someone brutally took her away too. But even once Mattie died, Sadie's love for her never did. Sadie's unwavering, unconditional devotion to her sister drove her to seek vengeance. It was the only thing that kept her going because she had nothing left.That was the biggest takeaway I got from this book in the end. Of course there are other things too; the reality that monsters are everywhere and they take human form. That you should always be careful who you let into your life. That someone you think you know well could most likely be a complete stranger. But I truly feel that the essence of this book lies in the love that Sadie has for her sister, and that's why it's so powerful. I know that the \"Power of Love\" trope is one of the most overused and cliched tropes in history, but I think that's because in a lot of those movies/books/etc, love saves the day. Of course love doesn't save the day in this story, because the worst has already happened. But it still proves how powerful love is because, to quote from this book, it can be the thing that drives us. I am so glad I got to read this. It's definitely one of the most moving, heart-wrenching stories I've read this year, and will probably stay on my mind for a long time."}, {"userName": "Chelsea Humphrey", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47207032-chelsea-humphrey", "userReview": "Putting this one on hold for now.

Sadie by Courtney Summers is the story of Sadie Hunter, who is grieving over the tragic death of her thirteen-year-old sister Mattie Southern. Sadie, nineteen, has raised Mattie since their mother Claire abandoned the girls to continue her descent into drug addiction and sick relationships with men. The only person that the girls have is May Beth Foster, a kind but outspoken sixty-eight-year-old woman who manages the Sparkling River Trailer Park. May Beth takes on the role of the girls\u2019 grandmother and protector. Shortly after Mattie\u2019s death, Sadie disappears from their home in Cold Creek, Colorado. Sadie\u2019s disappearance is brought to the attention of West McCray, a radio personality who decides to do a podcast about the missing Sadie. McCray is not merely reporting however, he actually begins investigating the case and is deeply affected by the girls\u2019 lives.The story is told from the alternating perspectives of Sadie and McCray. McCray\u2019s broadcasts also consist of interviews with the locals in this small, sad town. McCray uses them to try and understand why Sadie vanished. Mary Beth suspects foul play and feels that the police are not doing enough, but Sadie is an adult and is at liberty to leave little Cold Creek if she pleases. Sadie even refers to her town as a place that\u2019s only good for leaving. But Sadie is on a mission, she is trying to avenge little Mattie\u2019s death. This mystery has an interesting plot that keeps the pages turning. Miss Summers can write a story. Other than the age of the protagonist, I don\u2019t see the novel as \u201cjust\u201d a YA read; Sadie will appeal to readers of all ages.Many thanks to NetGalley, St. Martin\u2019s Press and Ms. Summers for the ARC of this novel."}, {"userName": "Roshani Chokshi", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26262898-roshani-chokshi", "userReview": "This is a top 5 read of the year for me.

Sadie is no exception, and is the most literary of her work to date. The writing shines, with phrases turned to perfection, and pieces of plot jigsawing into place in a most satisfying manner. After her sister's murder, Sadie sets off to seek revenge. Five months later, a true-crime podcast explores the mysteries of Mattie's death and Sadie's disappearance. The narrative alternates between Sadie's POV as she travels across the country in search of the killer, and a transcript of the podcast that aired months later. This lets the story unfold at a perfect pace, revealing hidden secrets and motivations and dropping clues at just the right moments to keep the reader on edge and guessing, right up until the moment it RIPS YOUR HEART OUT.It's no secret I love dark and twisty mysteries, so this book is obviously smack dab in the middle of my comfort zone. But amidst the current crop of YA psychological thrillers, Sadie stands out as exceptional. It's a story of dysfunctional families, monsters that hide in plain sight, and the ways that love, loss, and guilt shape and drive us.I received an ARC of this book because my awesome coworker grabbed it for me at PLA.

I have this weird sense of English-teachery pride for how much she\u2019s grown over the past (almost) decade. Yes, I know that I had absolutely nothing to do with her books getting steadily better, but it\u2019s been a real pleasure to sit here on the sidelines and root her on while rabidly reading them all. Her books have always been brutally honest, tightly written, and engrossing, but this one transcends the rest. It\u2019s that rare mix of writing so beautiful and true that it\u2019s painful AND perfect pacing AND a compelling plot AND a thought-provoking theme. And not only does it have ALL of that \u2013 this one is formatted in a way that I\u2019ve honestly never seen before.The story unfolds through a mix of podcast transcripts from \u201cThe Girls\u201d (a true-crime investigation type show a la \u201cSerial\u201d) and first person narration from Sadie, a teenage girl on a mission to find the man who hurt her sister, Mattie. At a very young age, Sadie took over almost complete responsibility for Mattie from their drug-addicted mother \u2013 a responsibility that she never saw as a burden. Rather, Mattie was Sadie\u2019s entire world. Sadie took on the role of caregiver, disciplinarian, and even scapegoat \u2013 whatever Mattie needed her to be. When Mattie was murdered in a field outside their small trailer and the case went cold soon after, Sadie lost all direction in life except one: the trail left by her sister\u2019s killer. She becomes so devoted to this goal that she foregoes food, sleep, and personal safety as she ricochets from place to place, single-mindedly tracking the killer\u2019s movements.Meanwhile, Sadie and Mattie\u2019s story attracts the attention of West McCray, an NPR-ish radio host who begins following simple leads in the case and can\u2019t seem to stop. We as readers get to essentially become omniscient spectators as we see Sadie ruthlessly track her prey and hear West follow\u2026always too slow and many steps behind. This mode of storytelling really brought home the futility of West\u2019s search for me \u2013 although Sadie\u2019s chapters kept me on the edge of my seat, always hoping that she would come through unscathed, I knew that there would be no happy ending for her. Indeed, upon coming to the final pages of this book, I purposely slowed down because I thought irrationally that maybe, somehow, if I slowed down then someone would get to Sadie in time and help her. I think that I jabbed my kindle at least three times trying to get to another page before I realized that the story was just\u2026over. What reverberates the most in this book are the stifled howls of girls who are in desperate situations but who know that no one is coming to save them. Courtney Summers paints a bleak but realistic picture of the world here: a world that\u2019s really just an elaborate and painful obstacle course of trauma for girls. There comes a time when all of it is simply too much to carry.This book is an excellent recommendation for someone who enjoyed The Female of the Species or Allegedly or even One of Us is Lying, and I can\u2019t wait to book-talk the heck out of it in the library next year. My students are clamoring for twisty mysteries, and I think that this has the potential to be a real commercial success for Courtney Summers."}, {"userName": "Arden", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21495760-arden", "userReview": "[Trigger Warning: pedophilia, child abuse, violence (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8369202-katie", "userReview": "I tore through the first 60 pages of this book. I loved how unique the narrative was, using the podcast to convey where West McCray was during his investigation. But after awhile this structure started to bother me. Eventually, we know what Sadie is doing, where she\u2019s going, and why. So when West is always a few steps behind, talking to the same people, but still missing the facts, I felt like I was just reading the same thing over again but not getting as much out of it. I think that this style would ultimately work better as a movie or tv show (which I would definitely watch).There\u2019s a lot more depth to this story than I thought I was going to get when I first picked it up. Sadie has survived a painful past, and she\u2019s on the cusp of a painful future when we start following her. I wanted this kind of background for the other characters as well, because otherwise they\u2019re not memorable. The ending also drove me insane.

So many authors like to bog down their writing but it's just so melodramatic."}, {"userName": "Christina Nina", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23646363-christina-nina", "userReview": "So somehow, the stars aligned for me, and I was lucky enough to have received an ARC from Wednesday Books of Sadie, Courtney Summers' newest novel. Saying that I was excited would be a complete understatement. I have been completely geeking out about it! And WOW. If I hadn't already believed that Courtney Summers is one of the greatest YA authors there is, I definitely believe it now. I've said this before, but I mean it even more now: Courtney Summers deserves all the praise in the world. Because her books always succeed to move me in such a way that my heart is literally in pieces when I'm finished with her books. Her writing is so wonderfully harsh and bold; she is never afraid to shed light on those dark pieces of us that make us human, the pieces we often keep hidden out of fear of what others might think. She is also completely unafraid to write about dark, unsettling topics such as rape and sexual abuse, and represents them in a real, relentless, painful, yet beautiful way. Reading her books is like an addiction: I know it's going to hurt, but I do it anyway, because it hurts so GOOD.This book is different from her other novels, as it's told in a non-linear, shared narrative that is split between the first person perspective of Sadie, and through the compilation of interviews being broadcast on a podcast. As the host, West McCray, tells the story of how his life was turned upside down by the request that he investigate the story of Sadie Hunter, a missing girl from a small, lackluster town who disappeared not long after her younger sister was brutally murdered, we are given bits and pieces of Sadie's story through her own account. This story is mysterious and unsettling, and left me guessing until the end. This is a story about the immensity of grief after tragedy. This is a story about a girl driven by that grief to act out in vengeance. But most of all, this is a story about the power of love as a driving force, one that can make us just as easily as it breaks us.Please, everyone, read this book! Actually, while you're at it, just read them all. Because Courtney Summers is, herself, a driving force in this marvelous literary world that everyone needs to experience!"}], "description": "A gripping novel about the depth of a sister's love; poised to be the next book you won't be able to stop talking about.A missing girl on a journey of revenge and a Serial-like podcast following the clues she's left behind.
