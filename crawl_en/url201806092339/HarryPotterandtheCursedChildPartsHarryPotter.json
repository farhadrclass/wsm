I completely get why many HP fans will be disappointed with this, but I have to admit: I really enjoyed it. I'd love to see this story play out on stage.So yeah, I understand the sad feelings. Harry Potter and the Cursed Child has a completely different vibe. Aside from being a play, it's also a more mature, character-driven, less magical story. It does not feel like an eighth Harry Potter book at all; there's a real disconnect between this play and the other seven novels. And you know what? I'm so glad. I guess it's just what you're hoping for. To be honest, I never wanted another Harry Potter book. The thought of extending a series I loved so much actually made me NOT want to read this. I got to the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows and thought it was magical perfection - the story had completed its arc in full and I put it aside feeling a slight melancholy, but a whole lot of satisfaction. I didn't want more.However, if you went crazy needing more from the HP series, you'll probably be disappointed by this. If you feel there's a gap where something HP is missing, then I don't think this will fill it. Separate the two in your mind, and you have a better chance of liking it. Because this is something different - and I'm happy about it.First, of course, it's a play. Right away it's going to be something unlike what we've seen before. I don't usually love to read plays, especially modern ones, but this one is very readable because the dialogue is wonderful. I don't know why people are saying \"it's so obvious JKR didn't write most of this\" because I think her style is all over it - the very fact that this play (which is meant to be viewed on stage) can be just as easily read like a book tells me JKR had a lot of input.Also, it's funny. Much more consistently comical than the books, but with the same style of humour - i.e. lots of Ron being a buffoon. \nHermione: If some part of Voldemort survived, in whatever form, we need to be prepared. And I\u2019m scared.Ginny: I\u2019m scared too.Ron: Nothing scares me. Apart from Mum.\nThe plot leaves a little something to be desired. Again, it feels different from the main series. It's not so much about the world and magic, but more about relationships, conflicts (particularly between Harry and Albus) and the dialogue between characters. I suppose this makes more sense in a play, where the story unravels through dialogue and not through an omniscient narrator.And, as I touched upon earlier, it feels... older. I don't know how well kids will appreciate the jokes about growing old and how Ron now says \"oof\" every time he sits down. Or the family drama between Harry and his son, Albus. But I liked it. I'm happy with this addition. I truly am. If it had been too similar to the seven novels, I feel it would have risked reopening a series that had been closed in a great place. Instead, we have something very unique and, for me, very entertaining. Some of the staging directions also leave me excited about seeing the play (when I win the lottery or acquire a magic wand, maybe).One thing I have to say that I said in another comment thread: NOW, it's time to stop. This was a risky experiment and it turned out to be fun, but JKR needs to leave this world alone now. I really do not want to read about old-age Harry, Ron and Hermione rolling around in magical wheelchairs. So, just stop.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube | Store"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "It was alright. It was just alright.I know I gave this 4 stars, but to be honest, J.K. Rowling can write a dictionary with Harry Potter illustrations and I'd probably give it 4 stars, so my rating is almost irrelevant here, given my extreme bias.The thing is, it was cute, it was sweet, it was entirely nostalgic to see the old crew again, but I hated the play format. As a person who grew up with Harry Potter, and who is in her early 30s now, I feel like I grew up with Harry Potter and the crew, and with the advent of this book, I have, in fact, grown old with them. It was lovely to see them again. It was like meeting old friends.I don't feel old. I'm a more responsible person, for sure, but I feel young at heart. When we're young, adulthood, responsibilities, just the prospect of adulting seem so daunting...then one gets there and it's like, well, I'm as immature as I ever was. I love fun as much as I ever did. Growing old isn't that bad. And seeing the old crew being as much as they ever were brings joy into my not-yet-old-and-grizzled-heart.I could do without the kids, to be honest. Oh, sure, they're little Potter and Granger-Weasley spawns, but come on, nobody ever has and nobody ever will win me over as much as their parents, whom I have loved the instant we met them on the Hogwarts Express.(Ok, maybe not Ron...)But I digress. The kids aren't all bad. I rather like little Scorpius, actually.\nSCORPIUS: And it\u2019s just like my father\u2019s! I got his nose, his hair, and his name. Not that that\u2019s a great thing either. I mean \u2014 father-son issues, I have them. But, on the whole, I\u2019d rather be a Malfoy than, you know, the son of the Dark Lord.\nThe adults have grown, they've changed. Some have changed so much that I hardly recognize them, Draco, for instance. I like that he's, well, nicer now, but he doesn't feel like Draco, you know? I've been so used to Harry and Draco doing this...That it's rather discombobulating to see anything otherwise.But yeah, characters are great, but the format. THE FORMAT. I don't even know it's fair of me to judge this based on the fact that I don't like that it's a play, because for fuck's sakes, IT'S A PLAY. Like, what did I expect? This may be the most confusing review I've ever written. I just don't like the play format. It's meant for the stage. That means it's up to the skill of the actors to portray what is implied. It's up to the audience to interpret nuances. It is almost entirely based on dialogue, and I hate that. I miss Rowling's writing. I love Rowling's writing, and I wanted more of it. The play brings up so many things that could have been written so much more, had it been expanded into a book format. The children's growing pains, particular that of young Albus. Harry's feelings as a parent. Draco's struggles with who he was and who he is. Furthermore, Ron is relegated to little more than comic relief. Let's be honest, I never liked the guy, but for him to be much of the same character that he ever was conjures up the image of the try-hard middle-aged dude, and I know that Ron is more than that.I like it? I don't like it? I don't know. But I would certainly relish watching it on the stage if I ever had the chance. It's bound to be better than on paper."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "You know, I really hadn\u2019t foreseen the publication of something to lengthen Harry Potter\u2019s story after the conclusion that was Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. So, the way I see it, Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a lovely gift to every Harry Potter fan out there who has hoped and waited a long time to see their wizard friends again.Though the plot holes are very visible and spread throughout the story, they make for charming and heartfelt conversations between characters, so I didn\u2019t mind them all that much.The best thing about this #8 Harry Potter is how nostalgic it makes the reader feel. There are plenty of familiar faces \u2013 Harry, Ginny, Draco, Hermione, Ron, Dumbledore, etc \u2013 as well as some interesting new ones \u2013 Albus, Rose, Scorpius, Lily, James\u2026Admittedly, it was strange to read this supposedly 8th story in Harry Potter\u2019s world in play format but the truth is, it was extremely easy to imagine everything play out like in a movie, so it all felt alive to me.This isn\u2019t a book you have to read but, if you\u2019re a diehard Harry Potter fan, I am going to look at you quite incredulously if you decide not to. I\u2019m sadly not going to be able to tell you that you're making the right choice, because this is so, so charming and fun, but I can understand people wanting to have their own vision of the Harry Potter cast as adults and their children.

The plot is feasible, even if it felt a little forced, but the characters were just poor. The new ones aren\u2019t so bad, but the old characters, Harry, Ron and Hermione, were barely themselves. They just had no depth to them; they\u2019re like reflections of their surface level. Ron felt like a piece of furniture that seemed to enjoy inserting several badly times jokes. Hermione seemed cold. And Harry, Harry simply isn\u2019t Harry. How can he identify himself as a bad farther? How can he believe that he had no farther figure in his own life? He had many. He had inspiration from many great men. They taught him a great deal about life and himself in the process. So why would a man who has defeated the face of evil be so daunted by giving his son some simple advice? It doesn\u2019t add up. Harry Potter would make an excellent farther.

Harry Potter and the Cursed Child continues the wondrous magical world that we all know and love.The story starts out at King's Cross with the original trio preparing their school-age children to board the train to start their first year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.It's at this time that Harry and his son, Albus, share a nice father-son moment:\u201cAlbus: Dad . . .Do you think \u2014 what if I am \u2014 what if I\u2019m put in Slytherin . . .Harry: And what would be wrong with that?Albus: Slytherin is the House of the snake, of Dark Magic . . . It\u2019s not a House of brave wizards.Harry: Albus Severus, you were named after two headmasters of Hogwarts. One of them was a Slytherin and he was probably the bravest man I ever knew.\u201d(I dislike Snape, but the overall conversation made me tear up a bit.)I also really appreciated that they talked about Slytherin in a positive light.We have a few time jumps here and there, and then complications arise because Harry - Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement - seized an illegal Time-Turner from Theodore Nott and has kept it.\u201cThe once-great Harry Potter, now a stone-cold Ministry man.\u201dMeanwhile, Albus gets sorted into Slytherin and struggles with the weight of a family legacy he never wanted.Harry tries to reach out to Albus but finds that he has diffuclity understanding someone different. And their connection wobbles from year to year because of it.\u201cHarry: Do you want a hand? Packing. I always loved packing. It meant I was leaving Privet Drive and going back to Hogwarts. Which was . . . well, I know you don\u2019t love it but . . .Albus: For you, it\u2019s the greatest place on earth. I know. The poor orphan, bullied by his uncle and aunt Dursley . . .Harry: Albus, please \u2014 can we just \u2014Albus: . . . traumatized by his cousin, Dudley, saved by Hogwarts. I know it all, Dad. Blah, blah, blah.Harry: I\u2019m not going to rise to your bait, Albus Potter.Albus: The poor orphan who went on to save us all. So may I say \u2014 on behalf of wizarding kind \u2014 how grateful we are for your heroism. Should we bow now or will a curtsy do?Harry: Albus, please \u2014 you know, I\u2019ve never wanted gratitude.Albus: But right now I\u2019m overflowing with it \u2014 it must be the kind gift of this moldy blanket that did it . . .Harry: Moldy blanket?Albus: What did you think would happen? We\u2019d hug. I\u2019d tell you I always loved you. What? What?Harry (finally losing his temper): You know what? I\u2019m done with being made responsible for your unhappiness. At least you\u2019ve got a dad. Because I didn\u2019t, okay?Albus: And you think that was unlucky? I don\u2019t.Harry: You wish me dead?Albus: No! I just wish you weren\u2019t my dad.\u201dHarry and Albus are trying to reach each other here, both are failing.As past and present fuse ominously, both father and son learn the uncomfortable truth: sometimes darkness comes from unexpected places.The Cursed Child answered a lot of topics that had been left unanswered in my mind, and it makes my heart tighten just thinking about everything.\u201cHarry: And I\u2019ve locked away the map. You won\u2019t see it again. Your mum left your room exactly as it was when you ran away \u2014 you know that? Wouldn\u2019t let me go in \u2014 wouldn\u2019t let anyone go in \u2014 you really scared her . . . And me.Albus: Really scared you?Harry: Yes.Albus: I thought Harry Potter wasn\u2019t afraid of anything?Harry: Is that how I make you feel?Albus looks at his dad, trying to figure him out.ALBUS: I don\u2019t think Scorpius said, but when we returned after failing to fix the first task, I was suddenly in Gryffindor House. Nothing was better between us then either \u2014 so \u2014 the fact that I\u2019m in Slytherin \u2014 that\u2019s not the reason for our problems. It\u2019s not just about that.\u201dI really appreciated that their relationship was developed in a very honest and raw way.And not only theirs, but the development of Draco and his son, Scorpius, was truly melting my everything.\u201cDraco: Astoria always knew that she was not destined for old age. She wanted me to have somebody when she left, because . . . it is exceptionally lonely, being Draco Malfoy. I never realized, though, that by hiding him away from this gossiping, judgmental world, I ensured that my son would emerge shrouded in worse suspicion than I ever endured.Harry: Love blinds. We have both tried to give our sons, not what they needed, but what we needed. We\u2019ve been so busy trying to rewrite our own pasts, we\u2019ve blighted their present.\u201dWatching Draco care deeply and fiercely for his child made me open up my heart.Oh, and I wanted to mention how ecstatic I was when Albus befriended a Malfoy. Their friendship was inspiring until the very last heartbreaking page.\u201cScorpius: Your dad thinks the rumors are true \u2014 I am the son of Voldemort?Albus (nods): His department are currently investigating it.Scorpius: Good. Let them. Sometimes \u2014 sometimes I find myself thinking \u2014 maybe they\u2019re true too.Albus: No. They\u2019re not true. And I\u2019ll tell you why. Because I don\u2019t think Voldemort is capable of having a kind son \u2014 and you\u2019re kind, Scorpius. To the depths of your belly, to the tips of your fingers. I truly believe Voldemort \u2014 Voldemort couldn\u2019t have a child like you.Scorpius: That\u2019s nice \u2014 that\u2019s a nice thing to say.Albus: And it\u2019s something I should have said a long time ago. In fact, you\u2019re probably the best person I know. And you don\u2019t \u2014 you couldn\u2019t \u2014 hold me back. You make me stronger \u2014 and when Dad forced us apart \u2014 without you \u2014Scorpius: I didn\u2019t much like my life without you in it either.\"We also had a lot of unexpected returns from the people that ended up sacrificing themselves in previous books, which truly broke me\u2014 I kept looking for Fred Weasley to show up and crack a joke... but, alas, you can't always get what you want.But to end this review on a more positive note, I want to mention my favorites: Hermione and Ron.\u201cRon: I mean, we\u2019ve been together so long \u2014 and married for so long \u2014 I mean, so long \u2014Hermione: If this is your way of saying you want a marital break, Ron, then, to be clear, I will skewer you with this quill.Ron: Shut up. Will you shut up for once? I want to do one of those marriage renewal things I\u2019ve read about. Marriage renewal. What do you think?Hermione (melting slightly): You want to marry me again?Ron: Well, we were only young when we did it the first time and I got very drunk and \u2014 well, to be honest, I can\u2019t remember much of it and . . . The truth is \u2014 I love you, Hermione Granger, and whatever time says \u2014 I\u2019d like the opportunity to say so in front of lots of other people. Again. Sober.She looks at him, she smiles, she pulls him to her, she kisses him.Hermione: You\u2019re sweet.Ron: And you taste of toffee . . .\u201dI'm always up for more canon Romione.To sum up, I thought at first that the format of the story would interfere with getting completely pulled in, but I needn't have worried\u2014 this book was the definition of unputdownable. It truly didn't take long for me to realize how much I missed reading about Harry Potter and his magical surroundings. Hogwarts will always be like home. And now... I'm getting tearful just thinking about what an impact it made on me, as both the reader and person I am today.Also, it was pretty nice getting to know that both Harry Potter and I are afraid of pigeons:\u201cHarry: You told me you don\u2019t think I\u2019m scared of anything, and that \u2014 I mean, I\u2019m scared of everything. I mean, I\u2019m afraid of the dark, did you know that?Albus: Harry Potter is afraid of the dark?Harry: I don\u2019t like small spaces and \u2014 I\u2019ve never told anyone this, but I don\u2019t much like \u2014 (he hesitates before saying it) pigeons.Albus: You don\u2019t like pigeons?Harry (he scrunches up his face): Nasty, pecky, dirty things. They give me the creeps.\u201dYes, Harry!!Oh, and my favorite acts were acts 2 & 4\u2014 because family dynamics and mystery!!Just... I'm so glad this book exists, I truly missed my favorite trio.5/5 stars (of course)*Note: I'm an Amazon Affiliate.

YES., It's a Play..screen play - and not to mention that there's a \u2018Definitive Edition\u2019 of the play as it is just the Rehearsal Edition.. Not the Trio story rather the children's? YES. It's story of 19 years later...of the new generation..So STOP Moaning like Myrtle,It's still very faithful to the magical series..A perfect conclusion to the Symmetry* of the Epic series in the History.~~~~~~~~~~Since the Ending of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows we wanted more...One more time.Many asking too many \"What If\"..What if Harry's son end up in Slytherin?What if Ron and Hermione didn't work out as the author herself suspects?What if there's a Time Turner left?What if we use it to save someone of Death?What if we use it to save Voldemort? or to make more Horcrux ? Or worst? What if we had One More Book? Nineteenth Years Later?**The Play**--------First of all, Please do a Worldwide tour...Please include Egypt.It's easy to read, and to get into the story..Alas, I have to admit that being in form of \u2018play\u2019 and not a novel made it even a bit \u201cdry\u201d like most Fan Fictions., I even thought, after spending a direct 6 hours reading 3 Acts that it may be one and not the real deal -since I read it first in ebook format till my hard copy arrive to Egypt- Anyway, You have to use your imagination to get the scenes...recall your past experience, life in Hogwarts and you'll be easily in...Reliving the MagicAdd to being a play, it's not all by J.K. Rowling, the story is by her, Jack Thorne and John Tiffany together..And the Playwright is by Jack Thorne...not Rowling.Yet the lines are really fun, smart..just amazing.And you have to let go once you start \u2018Act Two\u2019 cause everything starts to heat up much..in a very fast packed adventure, and theatrical dramatic ones\u2026The Story--------\u201cCan you Keep the Secret?\u201dWill try my best.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~It's different... more mature...real wild and dangerous cause it deals with the most dangerous Instruments...TIME..This time you'd feel that Rowling is really cruel to the characters..It may be about the Test of Life....To Choose between what's good and what's easy..BUT it was real hard test to us all..I will merely summing up only Act One..It starts right with the \u201cHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\u201d Epilogue scene..Albus Severus Potter is worried sick he'd end up in SlythrineYet.. as soon as he started his year, this was the least of his troubles.Surprisingly befriended with Scorpius Malfoy, surprisingly hates Hogwarts\u2026Surprisingly hates being the child of The Boy Who Lived, while many died in his cause.The Father/Son issue in its worst..And before his fourth year starts..Everything happens fast\u2026Harry as Ministry official and Hermione as Minister for Magic seize an illegal last Time Turner..that even more dangerous..Amos Diggory wants his son back...who had been killed by Voldmort in the Triwizard Tournament more than 20 years ago..Albus feels his father's responsible for this death..An attempt to change a minor misfortune of the past leads into a massive , colossal damage to the present and the future..And even turns into a horrible Dystopia.It's like The Butterfly Effect\u2026 Days of Future PastAgain it's a story of the value of Friendship\u2026 The wrong of Prejudice... But it's also about Father/Son relation very well written..I loved how it goes, from wrong to kinda right.Between Harry and Albus, Between Dumbledore and Harry\u2026And even between Draco and Scorpius..Also the Marital relation is really good here\u2026I loved Ron and Hermione their opposite character yet their strong bond.And the love that lived...between Harry and Ginny.Oh and Draco and his wife\u2026Okay, time for,The Characters-----------Again... Rowling is really cruel to her characters here..Harry's being a \"Hot Head\" is clearly deepening the problem with his son.. he's always has been a hot head by the way..yet Ginny is a good mother, and better wife than I expected.Hermone was good , not excellent but I LOVED how she turned into two different characters .. one was really awesome in the Dystopia, the second was really bad...but that may match what happened.I just may be didn't like Ron much that I didn't feel angry enough for him being a bit shallow in this play but that still a bit sad.And I have to admit that I really LOVE how Draco is...with his still being have the trace of what he was before...BUT don't forget it's not about Harry Potter anymore...it's more about the Kids...Though I wished to see more of Rose who's been shallow but I just loved Albus and Scorpios..You'll be surprised with who you're gonna meet here.. truly.Some of the Characters we all love makes appearance, some of them even you may never expect to see again!!!! I have to say that I felt goosebumps everytime an old character appears...not just flashbacks, some was in The Future Past, or a real dystopia, some in dreams, even in portraits and some are just mentioned.I really loved it. And wished for even more.I was so sad for the death of some, and the re-death of some..And just remember ... when you're 40.. you don't live the adventures much as your children..And this last story is about them after all....The Children..Who's The Cursed Child-------------------As if I'm gonna tell, ha!Till the mid of the third act you'll have many suspicious.In Harry Potter\u2019s dreams here he can be The Cursed Child...-one of the best haunting scenes in every early novels was always Harry\u2019s dreams, I bet it's purely written by Rowling here-oh and looking from The Dursleys perspective, he is..even worse, he's so in his Son's eyes as well\u2026And that's what triggers everything here.Many surprises, many twists\u2026I loved it\u2026 I loved the ending as well\u2026Playing in time is dangerous and as every one since the last book asked about Why Not Using the Time Turner\u2026.here's the answer..in the last book of the Series that changed the History forever..Letting Go.------------By the end of this book you'll realize why J.K. Rowling announced that that's it for Harry Potter stories\u2026 it is the the full circle\u2026 the Beginning meets the End..the time has answered every What-if we can think of.What if we use the time Turner to...It's all here.19 Years for most of us, since the release of Harry Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone in 1997...Reading the story of Harry and his friends in 7 Volumes..Reading as many lines about the back story of them and the rest of characters in the Pottermore and social media by Rowling. Craving for one more time with them...after the Epilogue that passed 19 years.Get excited with the very short article 2 years ago on Dumbledore Army reunited in the Qudditch World Cup.Now here it is, a full story, one last story full of love and nostalgia.We can't go back in time. We shan't dwell in the past..And when I finish it, 2 times, I really admit This is EVERYTHING I've ever wanted in a Harry Potter sequels but I just wish a Time Turner, back to 1997 and start reading Harry Potter all over again.... :)It's not good to dwell in past anyway, so I'm just Happy I lived this series..grown up with it..I, and many of Potterheads and fans, were worried sick it may let us down but I'm so glad that many liked it.And it's bittersweet to know that's it.BUT We must have THE \u2018Definitive Edition\u2019 of the play that promised.The series of Harry Potter, the boy who lived,is now complete\u2026And we still have a Wizarding World so vast to explore.With J.K.

The questions that were left unanswered kept the story alive as I would imagine what might be going on in their lives as adults. This answers all those questions and then some. I wanted to rate this higher but I think 2.5 is as high as I can go. These characters didn't feel like the characters I fell in love with.

Rowling could punch me in the face, and I'd still like it. The truth is, this isn't one of her stories, and it shows. For one, it's not even a book.Regardless, the magic is here, and I like it just the same. The plot might be convoluted and crazy, but the world is magical enough for it to somehow work. It makes for all the thrills and mystery you come to expect from the Harry Potter universe.Coming back to this series felt like returning to school after a long summer break. Although it takes place 19 years later, it seems to pick up right where the originals left off. Dumbledore returns as a moving painting, there's time-turners and polyjuice potion and sneaking around in invisibility cloaks and raids on the Ministry of Magic. It's silly yet serious, and filled with thrills and intrigue, and most of all fun.But more than any of that, the Harry Potter universe is known for its characters, and in this installment, a couple more can now be mentioned with the best. Harry's son, Albus, is an outcast--everything Harry isn't, in a bad way, and the two struggle to relate until Albus becomes so isolated he starts falling down the same path that Voldemort did. And then there's Draco's son, always around, leading Albus down the wrong path, bringing up bad-blood from the past, and helping Albus make monstrous mistakes--all while having a personality that's sure to win you over."}, {"userName": "Natalie Monroe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6688207-natalie-monroe", "userReview": "[Harry chooses to stay behind to witness his parents' death and Ron says, \"We'll watch with you.\" That's him; that's the youngest male Weasley to the letter.

Don\u2019t read this if you haven\u2019t read the Harry Potter series and Harry Potter and the Cursed Child yet!-------------------------------------If you loved Harry Potter and the Cursed Child, I wouldn\u2019t recommend reading my review. This is going to be a rant! You\u2019ve been warned!-------------------------------------This is the very first time I have rated a book one stars! Believe me, I don\u2019t want to do this, but I really didn\u2019t enjoy reading Cursed Child. Before I get started, I want you to know the following: 1. A couple of weeks ago, I read some spoilers from people who had watched the play. Those immediately lowered my expectations. I knew going into this I wasn\u2019t going to like it. 2. I knew this was not written by J.K. Rowling. 3. I knew this wasn\u2019t the eight book, but the script for the play.I love the Harry Potter series so much. And I always will. It means a lot to me and when I heard about this, I immediately pre-ordered it. I\u2019ve seen some people say \u2018it\u2019s Harry Potter so obviously I love this\u2019, but I can\u2019t say the same. Call me critical but I spent money on this. People spend money on tickets to go see the play. I expect something decent in return then.To call this fanfiction is an insult to all the people who try to bring more joy to a fandom. The Cursed Child was just plain bad writing. I will get into detail later, but I refuse to accept what happened as canon. I don\u2019t care what J.K. Rowling says. This is a disgrace to the characters and the people who loved the original book series. You might think that I\u2019m taking this too seriously, but they shouldn\u2019t ask money for this if it were \u2018just for fun\u2019. This is literally being promoted as \u2018the eight story\u2019 in the Harry Potter series. I knew before I started it that it wasn\u2019t, but the marketing team pretends it is.So no, I won\u2019t apologise for being critical. Just because this isn\u2019t a book, but a play, doesn\u2019t mean that the story shouldn\u2019t be as good. In fact, that is such an insult to plays! It\u2019s just another form of media. I\u2019ve seen some people say: \u201cYou can\u2019t judge this if you haven\u2019t seen the play\u201d. Well, if that\u2019s the case, they shouldn\u2019t have published it as a book. I can\u2019t afford going to London and paying a lot of money in order for some people to validate my opinion.Let\u2019s start of with the things I did like:This felt as if I was reading a book. It didn\u2019t take time to adjust to the format. I\u2019m also curious to see what everything is going to look like in the actual play. But, since I really don\u2019t like the actual story and what they did to the characters, I\u2019m not sure yet whether I\u2019d be willing to pay money for that.Out of all the characters, Hermione was the only one who still resembled who she used to be. I\u2019m proud that she has become Minister for Magic! I also really liked Minerva! And Draco proved he was a good parent (much better than Harry\u2026).I enjoyed the interactions between Albus and Scorpius! They\u2019re such good \u2018friends\u2019 (A.K.A. boyfriends).That was it. Those were the only thing I like. My list of dislikes is much longer! I had six full pages of notes. When I read a book that\u2019s over a thousand pages long, I don\u2019t even have that many notes! Let\u2019s get started:The plot is basically 90% about trying to bring back Cedric Diggory. I don\u2019t understand why Albus is so obsessed with Cedric. So many people died for Harry, why does it have to be Cedric? Obviously because Amos asked, but to have almost the entire plot of this play resolve around that\u2026I\u2019d rather read every single second of a class taught at Hogwarts! Because this wasn\u2019t magical enough. Sure, it features the characters we know and love and Hogwarts, but we rarely get to see actual magic. When Albus, Delphi and Scorpius are searching for the Time Turner in Hermione\u2019s office, they don\u2019t even try \u2018accio\u2019! Instead, they search the entire bookcase! Whenever we do get some magic, it isn\u2019t explained enough. Why couldn\u2019t Delphi use \u2018imperio\u2019 on Albus? She said: \u201cto fulfil the prophecy [\u2026] Imperio just won\u2019t do\u201d. Why not? Or when Harry transfigured into Voldemort\u2026 Is that even possible? Why would wizards go through the trouble of brewing polyjuice potion then? All of this is just very convenient, but didn\u2019t make enough sense.One of the things that bothered me most, was Ron Weasley\u2019s characterisation. He has become a caricature of the person he used to be. The only reason he\u2019s there, is for comic relief. All he does is eat and make stupid jokes. They act as if he\u2019s so dumb and doesn\u2019t take anything serious. Did Thorne actually read the original series before he wrote this? Because this is not the Ron I know! I refuse to believe that he was so drunk at his own wedding he doesn\u2019t remember anything. And why would Ron give someone love potion? He had a terrible experience with it when he was a teenager, why in the world would he do that? It doesn\u2019t make any sense!Another character who was completely butchered was Cedric Diggory. In the alternate universe where he lost the Triwizard Tournament, he becomes a death-eater and kills Neville. Cedric was one of the kindest characters. It\u2019s absurd to assume that he would become a racist murderer just because he got humiliated!Scorpius said: \u201cCedric was a different person entirely \u2013 dark, dangerous\u201d. We only found out that he killed Neville, but Scorpius didn\u2019t interact with him. I don\u2019t understand where this observation comes from. And I had that feeling quite a few times while reading this; as if I had skipped a couple of pages without realising it.Harry Potter is a terrible father. I didn\u2019t like him once in this \u2018book\u2019. Granted, Albus is a whiny teenager: he has no idea how privileged he is. Don\u2019t tell me he doesn\u2019t get special treatment because he\u2019s a Potter. A lot of people have it worse than him. Still, Harry had no right to say the things he did. And his excuse? He didn\u2019t have a father figure growing up. He had plenty! What about Arthur, Sirius, Remus, Hagrid and even Dumbledore, Harry?! Harry had no right to attack Minerva either. Just because a woman doesn\u2019t have children, doesn\u2019t mean she isn\u2019t able to take care of them. She\u2019d be a much better parent than he ever was.And when did he become a psychic? His scar hurts, he actually hears Voldemort\u2019s voice and can speak Parseltongue again, but Delphi hadn\u2019t even saved Voldemort yet (actually, she never does). How is he able to do that if nothing has changed? Voldemort wasn\u2019t back, yet he acted as if he was? Once again, I just don\u2019t understand\u2026Also, what is up with Lily\u2019s blanket? I don\u2019t remember him ever talking about it in the books, yet now Harry pretends as if it\u2019s his most precious possession in the entire world. I know he didn\u2019t possess it in the other books, but it\u2019s still strange that he\u2019s so obsessed with it now.Oh, and the special privileges? Harry is at Hogwarts all the damn time! I don\u2019t remember parents being allowed there. I guess being a Potter does mean you\u2019re allowed to do more than others.A lot of people hate Severus Snape and don\u2019t see him as a brave person. While I don\u2019t feel as strongly about that as them, I completely understand why they feel that was. He was horrible to his pupils, particularly Hermione, Harry and Neville. But, in the alternative universe, Hermione and Ron secretly work together with him. He used to be so mean to them, it seems highly unlikely to me they would forgive him! Just because he didn\u2019t turn out to be a death-eater, doesn\u2019t mean it justifies his behaviour. Snape\u2019s interactions with Scorpius were so cringe-worthy. He isn\u2019t a nice guy who makes one or two jokes and he\u2019d never talk that openly about Lily.Because so many characters felt differently, I didn\u2019t care about them anymore. When Hermione and Ron sacrificed themselves and received the dementor\u2019s kiss, I felt nothing. On the one hand, I\u2019m sad we didn\u2019t get to see Sirius, Remus, Tonks an Teddy. But on the other hand, I\u2019m very glad, since their characters would have been butchered as well!This book almost pretends as if the other Potter and Granger-Weasley kids don\u2019t exist. Ever heard of Hugo???The timeline is so strange. Page 22 and a year has past. Page 27 and they\u2019re already starting their third year at Hogwarts. Seven pages later, another year has past! Surely, they could have given us a glimpse at their lives at Hogwarts without having to do it like this. Later on, Scorpius and Albus are in Scotland, without any brooms or wands. Yet the very next page, they\u2019re already in Godric\u2019s Hollow! How is that even possible? Again, this is not explained.And how did Albus and Scorpius know every single detail from what went down over twenty years ago at the Triwizard Tournament and Battle of Hogwarts? Did their parents tell them literally everything? Were very detailed books written? I need to know this!In the alternate universe, they kept mentioning an \u2018Augurey\u2019 and I had no idea what it meant. It\u2019s only explained many scenes later. I cannot stress enough how underdeveloped some plots were. Sometimes, I had no idea what was going on because things weren\u2019t explained well enough. And that causes plot holes.I\u2019m so thankful they didn\u2019t use the Time Turner often in the Harry Potter series. I can already imagine how how things would have ended otherwise: Harry would have gone back in time and kill Voldemort and save James and Lily. Whenever a universe has the ability to time travel, that\u2019s the kind of things that happen. It\u2019s predictable. Yet that\u2019s exactly what Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is about. They go back in time over FOUR TIMES just to go back to how things were at the beginning of the play. It\u2019s such a waste of time. I can think of so many plots that would have been more interesting. Imagine there\u2019s ever going to be a F.R.I.E.N.D.S movie and it turns out Monica has left Chandler and never wants to see her children again. That wouldn\u2019t make any sense at all. But that is how Cursed Child feels like to me.Prisoner of Azkaban is one of my favourite books an films, so I obviously have no problems with time travelling. But this was just too much.As I\u2019ve mentioned before, I really missed the magic. And of course the characters, because Cursed Child completely butchered them. Think of how much better this would be if it was about one school year at Hogwarts, without Voldemort trying to kill everyone. Just one year of the adventures Scorpius and Albus encounter. There didn\u2019t need to be this much family drama. Honestly, I\u2019m pretty sure this was the script of a Days of Our Lives or The Bold and the Beautiful episode instead! Just think how they could have explored the other houses, besides Gryffindor! But no, in Cursed Child, everyone is still prejudiced towards Slytherins and they pretend Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff don\u2019t even exist!This is only about three hundred pages long, yet it was so repetitive. Scorpius and Albus do something stupid; Draco, Harry and Ginny run after them and need Hermione because \u201ctheir children are missing!\u201d AGAIN!I also had some problems with the writing itself: Voldemort Day? \u2018Oh Potter\u2019 instead of \u2018Oh Shit\u2019? Mudbloods in the dungeons? The Blood Ball? WE GET IT, VOLDEMORT IS BACK! \u201cA Malfoy who may be a Voldemort\u201d Euhm, that\u2019s just awful writing. \u2018Voldemort\u2019 isn\u2019t a last name; it\u2019s not as if \u2018Lord\u2019 was his first name. It should have been \u2018Riddle\u2019 instead. \u2018Thank Dumbledore\u2019 instead of \u2018Thank God\u2019 is not only cheesy, it is also incredibly arrogant. I\u2019m not the most religious person but to say that Dumbledore is a God\u2026 It\u2019s so sexist that at the Triwizard Tournament, every school got a lot of cheers besides Beauxbatons! I know boys also attend it, but it\u2019s still more \u2018feminine\u2019 than Durmstrang or Hogwarts.Almost everyone who has read this, can\u2019t deny there is something going on between Albus and Scorpius. They are so gay! But of course, this book is heteronormative to the max! I can already hear J.K. Rowling in a couple of years: \u201cActually, they were dating, but it wasn\u2019t important to the story\u201d. Please don\u2019t give this woman any praise when it comes to diversity, she doesn\u2019t deserve it. The Cursed Child could have meant a great deal more if they weren\u2019t so afraid to include characters who aren\u2019t straight for a change. And don\u2019t even get me started on Albus\u2019 crush on Delphi. He\u2019s like fourteen and she was twenty? That\u2019s disgusting.Which brings me to Delphi, the daughter of Voldemort and Bellatrix. Do you really expect me to believe that Voldemort was capable of love and lust? Why do they feel the need to establish that every character is \u2018oh so straight\u2019?! Supposedly, Bellatrix gave birth to Delphi before the Battle of Hogwarts in Malfoy Manor. WHAT?! In Harry Potter and the Deadly Hallows, we actually see her there! Don\u2019t you think anyone would have noticed? DRACO ACTUALLY LIVED THERE! How oblivious is he supposed to be then? This doesn\u2019t make any sense!I could go on, but I think I\u2019ve made my point. There were so many things that bothered me and I don\u2019t ever want to read this again. I regret paying this much money for it. I refuse to accept this as canon. I will pretend this doesn\u2019t exist."}, {"userName": "Jen Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6492118-jen-campbell", "userReview": "Lol."}, {"userName": "Taneika", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5591031-taneika", "userReview": "Just going to keep my original pre-review here BC MY FEELINGS ARE THE SAME Although I do have some negative thoughts about it which I'll go into more detail with later, REGARDLESS, I finished this in one sitting and thought it was like, 95% fab"}, {"userName": "April (Aprilius Maximus)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20658145-april-aprilius-maximus", "userReview": "I HAVE A LOT OF FEELINGS.Here's my vlog of the launch party and my initial thoughts after reading! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqwyq..."}], "description": "Based on an original new story by J.K.
