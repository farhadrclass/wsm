With a special thanks to my ex-wife, who taught me the true meaning of horror.Wow. Just wow. This has got to be one of the best, craziest, whacked out zombie books I've ever read. There's a Pulp Fiction-esque cast of characters that boggle the imagination with their inventiveness - a septic tank driver, a Mexican cutie, the requisite kid, a World War II vet, a crazy lady with loose dentures - and those are just the \"good guys\". Add in the sheriff's crew, the ICE squad, the impossible scenario of Charlie the Nam vet, his snake and a monkey, sprinkle in some factory-inspired Mexican death and zombie resurrection. Oh, did I forget to mention the Bonnie and Clyde pair of meth-heads? Stir it all up with non-stop action and sprinkle lots of gore and a smidgeon of humor, a la \"Evil Dead\" style. This book has definitely made my top 5 for the year. Mr. William Bebb, thank you. From the bottom of my heart - what a great read!"}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5793497-amanda", "userReview": "Bebb\u2019s book is a fresh, engaging take on a zombie outbreak. The origin is a factory error, which is decidedly different from the more usual government experimentation or voodoo approach. It\u2019s great commentary on the exploitative practices of factories, not to mention the exploitation of illegal immigrants, without ever being too heavy-handed or preachy. The zombies are a mix of the rage virus and traditional undead. Before dying they are inexplicably full of rage and will eat almost anything but also when they die they reanimate. It\u2019s a cool mix, and I enjoyed it.The cast of characters is incredibly imaginative, diverse, and even-handed. People are truly just people (or zombies) regardless of age, gender, or ethnicity. And, really, how many books can say they have a WWII vet, a sewer truck worker, a mechanically talented Latina, a wheelchair-bound obese meth chef, a loyal dog, bicycling missionaries, and a pot-growing paraplegic Vietnam Vet. I mean, really. And none of them are two-dimensional caricatures either. They are all well-rounded and presented with thought and humanity.The plot is complex. I honestly did not know how it was going to end, and it maintains a fast pace throughout. I was never bored and was never entirely certain what was going to happen next. That\u2019s coming from a big zombie fan, so I do think that\u2019s saying something significant about the uniqueness of the engaging plot.What really makes the book, though, is the sprinkling of humor throughout. This type of humor won\u2019t match everyone, but it certainly works for me. I described it to my dad as \u201cPatrick F. McManus with zombies,\u201d but if you don\u2019t get that reference, it\u2019s hard to describe the humor. So, here are a couple of quotes from the book to demonstrate it.Your average one armed pot growing hermit who just murdered two men might be thinking about a variety of things. (location 2592)Crazy cop fuckers done bit off my titty. (location 5423)That second one\u2026.oh man. I laugh every time I see it.So with all this love, why not five stars? Well, compound sentences tend to run on and on with no commas or semi-colons, which can be a bit frustrating to read. Also, the book isn\u2019t quite properly formatted for the kindle. Overall, though, the formatting and comma issues did not distract me from the wonderfully unique and humorous zombie trailer park story. I\u2019m so glad my dad discovered this indie author and passed his work on to me, and I look forward to reading more of it in the future. Highly recommended to all zombie fans, provided you like the type of humor outlined above.Check out my full review."}, {"userName": "Greg Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6769882-greg-lindsay", "userReview": "Instant William Bedd fan! I read soooo many Zombie stories and while most are good more are average, very few are excellent. Valley Of Death, Zombie Trailer Park is one of those few. The story never slows once it get going, it just doesn't stop. There are a few \"flashbacks\" but they are never very long and complement the scenes. The characters are wonderful and well written..no seriously the characters are great. Even as new characters/victims are introduced through out the story it never takes away from what is going on. William has a talent for interweaving a host of people new and old with out breaking stride or loosing the readers attention. This was a very difficult book to put down. I'm looking forward to reading Zombies of All Hallows Evil! More Zombie books should be written this well."}, {"userName": "Rabbit {Paint me like one of your 19th century gothic heroines!}", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4709630-rabbit-paint-me-like-one-of-your-19th-century-gothic-heroines", "userReview": "At 2% I gave up.

But its okay because I love all things zombie, though I really wouldn't want to ever meet one. That said, I can't comfortable give a synopsis of this book. There is just so much going on and I know I would end up giving away to many spoilers.This book was good, and I really enjoyed it, had everything you look for in a zombie book. I liked most of the characters, but in my opinion the character you love the most should always die. . .but that is just my morbid brain thinking again. I enjoyed the fact that there was two different types of zombies in this book, you hit on the classic slow moving stupid zombies, and the newer sprinting semi smart ones as well. It was like watching the original and remake of Dawn of the Dead at the same time.As sick as it may sound I found many different parts amusing, like the Redneck Gourmets and when things would be given from an animals point of view. I do really want to know how the Redneck Gourmets came to life though. I also liked that everyone had a little back story thrown in and it wasn't overwhelming, it was sprinkled in lightly as the rest of the story continued on.I know it doesn't really matter to the book, but the authors little ramble in the beginning was very entertaining and set this book up for me. When I read something funny like that right of the bat, I expect the book to be good. It didn't disappoint. That said I fall in the same category as you with grammar, and an even worse one when it comes to spelling (thank goodness of google or you wouldn't understand anything I wanted to say here).Would I recommend this book? Yes, very good zombieness.http://zephyrbookreviews.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Victor", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9064551-victor", "userReview": "This book is great because of the surprise factor. I mean, really...what do you expect from a book titled \"Zombie Trailer Park\"... you expect zombies, and a trailer park. This book delivers perfectly in both these categories. I was honestly pleasantly surprised by how the book flowed, it was an easy read, the characters were about as deep as you would expect from a zombie genre, maybe even a little more fleshed out than expected. There was even a few tongue-in-cheek moments that let you know that the author was having some fun writing this. While the book doesn't try delving too deeply into the \"why\" around our localized zombie apocalypse (an industrial accident at a chemical facility doing some government research), it works for this book. In some ways this is more honest to the original zombie genre, where the why is irrelevant, simply surviving is important."}, {"userName": "Sunshine\u2730\u2730\u2730", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18013768-sunshine", "userReview": "Ooo, if you look at the cover just right, there's a skull in the middle. :) I loved this zombie book. The story was told through a large cast of characters, which would normally annoy me, but it this case, most of them didn't last long anyway. This is a hilarious take on a zombie outbreak taking over a trailer park sheltered in a valley. A handful of survivors have managed to stay hidden and after 3 days, are wondering when help's coming. But when there is no cell reception and the telephone pole is knocked down and 90% of the residents are illegal Mexicans, who's going to know to help?

I believe those who are zombie fans could really like this story. There are a lot of good disgusting descriptions of death, various forms of undead, and injuries on (live) people. There are some good people and there are some people you hope you would never meet either because of their stupidity or downright meanness as characters in this book. I like that not everyone is a great shot with a gun, a fantastic hero-type, all goody-goody nicey-nicey because LIFE isn't like that and PEOPLE aren't like that. The events that take place in this story are believable and that just might scare some people. The characters and how they interact are written well. It was interesting the author had written the story from several different viewpoints. It was mainly from the viewpoint of Josey - somewhere around half the book or so is written from Josey's viewpoint and the rest is from several other viewpoints or things happening. What I thought was different was when the author wrote from the viewpoint of an animal - like a rabbit, a rattlesnake, Boris the dog or Cha-ka the monkey. That didn't happen a lot but it was different. I enjoyed the interactions between the characters. Most of the time, people weren't very welcoming and many times there are mistakes of live people thinking another live person is one of the undead. People were brave and they were scared and they felt like none of this can be real because it only happens in movies and videos games - all quite believable reactions. The only very small part (near the end) that I felt was a bit unbelievable was a [slight spoiler] budding romance between Maria and Josey. Though I always think things like that shouldn't belong in books such as this. There wasn't a lot of mushiness on that front and I figure Maria must have initially been suffering from hero syndrome. Josey's just a man who was lonely and probably quite horny.I do want to note something that has nothing to do with the writing and more to do with the formatting of the book - it was sometimes difficult to know when there was a character viewpoint shift. In many areas there were larger than normal spaces between paragraphs usually when the character viewpoint was going to change (good indication to the reader) but there are some areas where the character viewpoint remains and the spaces are there or the larger space between paragraphs is simply not there at all. Not a huge deal but something worth noting for those readers who perhaps have a difficult time when there is a character viewpoint shift."}, {"userName": "Julie Ramsey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7843544-julie-ramsey", "userReview": "TITLE - VALLEY OF DEATH - ZOMBIE TRAILER PARKAUTHOR - WILLIAM BEBBIts another hot and steamy Monday in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

After I thought more about it being like 28 Days Later I was able to enjoy it a little more.The thing I really hated about this book was the authors attempt at describing what some animals were thinking, or even more annoying what the zombies were thinking.

The story seemed to drag on with characters thrown in just to stretch it out. I can't say I felt emotionally attached to any of the characters either except for the dog. Parts of the story didn't feel right to me either. The truck running out of gas didn't make much sense given Josey was in the middle of his run when the story started.

To their eternal regret some people have mistaken the screams echoing in the hills as coyotes singing to the moon. When Josey drives his truck down into the valley he quickly learns the horrifying truth. It's not coyotes howling- it's men or what used to be men. Josey discovers that the valley is home to the depraved, the noble, the damned, the innocent, the beautiful, and of course the walking dead. When the least dangerous thing you encounter is an angry rattlesnake you know you've made a wrong turn in Albuquerque.The story is over 110,000 words in length. It's eighteen chapters of adventure, excitement, horror, and thoughtful humor.What kind of zombies are they?  There has been an interesting but ultimately pointless debate going on for years about what constitutes a zombie. Is it a dead person who walks around causing mayhem? Or is it someone who is violently insane and seeks only to kill and destroy? Why not both? Nestled in a remote valley, the residents of The Albuquerque Springs Trailer Park have lived out there lives nearly forgotten by the rest of the world. The trailer park is home to dozens of illegal immigrants, a hermit who has turned his back on society, a veteran of World War 2, a grumpy old woman, a family of Meth cookers known to local police officials as the Redneck Gourmets, and a beautiful young woman, are just a few.Life was peaceful, quiet, and boring until a deadly industrial accident killed Juan, one of the illegal immigrants. His friends and neighbors promised to dispose of the victim's body. Unfortunately, he came back and disposed of them- one mouthwatering bite at a time.William Robert Bebb: Who is he?
