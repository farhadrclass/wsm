Set in post-apartheid South Africa Absolution is a thought provoking book, and engaging not necessarily, or least of all, in the sense one would initially expect. Much of the novel could be set in any other country that lived through two opposing government systems. While there are hints of the political realities of South Africa, such as the brief visit to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, the central theme of the novel addresses deep moral questions of the human condition that are not time or place specific. In the most overarching sense Absolution is a deep reflection on guilt and seeking foregiveness, on what is truth and why we may not even admit aspects of the truth and our behaviour to ourselves, let alone to others. How many shades of truth are there? Two central characters - Clare, a grand old dame of literature and Sam, her much younger biographer - enter over the course of the novel into a kind of intellectual and emotional \"pas de deux\", whereby each reacts to or dances around the other's questions and answers. Both reveal slowly and tentatively snippets of themselves and their lives... leaving us as readers to sift through the many shades of truths. As we follow each piece within the emerging puzzle we may at times think we are ahead of the two protagonists, but are we really? While the \"pas de deux\", the discussions between author and biographer, are central to the novel, the backstories of the two protagonists, told in separate sections and in different tones, are as essential. There is Clare's \"letter\" to her daughter Laura, which reflects on and responds to her daughter's notebooks, written while she was on the run from authorities during the \"old regime\" some twenty years earlier. Clare is also writing a \"novel\", Absolution, that reads more like a personal memoir and in another series of chapters we learn more about Sam's life that was deeply shaken early on in his youth... Flanery is very effective in pursuing these different narrative streams, interleafing them in a way that,taken together, make for an engaging and comprehensive whole. Your attention is required to keep the different versions of the truth apart. Personally, I couldn't help comparing Clare with the real-life grand old dame of South African writing, Nadine Gordimer. Be assured, though, there are no parallels between the two, other maybe the home invasion that both experienced and that weighs heavily on Clare's mind. I was taken by surprise that, despite the important political undercurrent in the novel, so little was in fact expressed in terms of the complex South African realities then and now. Race or colour was hardly ever mentioned if at all. On the other hand, I found some sections too detailed and a tightening of those would have increased my reading engagement. Yet, for a debut novel, this book is a great achievement and we can hopefully look forward to more by the author."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "Absolution \u2013 set in post-apartheid South Africa \u2013 is so searing, well-plotted, moving and provocative that it is nearly impossible to believe that it is a debut book. In some important ways, it contains wisps of J.M. Coetzee\u2019s Disgrace, a book that similarly centers around the break-in of a home,The theme is, indeed, Absolution, the freeing from blame, guilt and consequences. Nearly every key character in Absolution is seeking forgiveness, either from the living or the dead, and as such, they are microcosms for their nation \u2013 a place that is in true need of absolution.Patrick Flanery masterfully layers his story in patchwork style. The conflicting points of view come from four different perspectives: that of Clare, an aging, reclusive and celebrated Cape Town author\u2026Sam, her young chosen biographer who holds a mysterious connection to Clare\u2026Clare\u2019s semi-fictional memoir \u2013 appropriately titled Absolution \u2013 which imagines what might have happened\u2026and a fourth thread, which reveals what may, indeed, be the truth.In brief, Clare is re-examining her past, which includes two pivotal deaths. Her hated sister, Nora, who held a pro-apartheid view, was gunned down years ago in what was likely a political reprisal. Clare\u2019s own daughter, Laura, an anti-apartheid activist, also disappeared without a trace. What culpability \u2013 if any \u2013 did Clare have in either of these deaths? Can Sam be the key to the absolution she seeks? And when Clare\u2019s home is senselessly broken into and an object of little monetary \u2013 but great personal \u2013 significance is taken, another question is raised: can a flawed memory hold its own kind of truth?Absolution is but one of this book\u2019s riveting themes. Another is the falsity of the stories we tell ourselves. \u201cIt is possible, through a sense of vanity, either conscious or unconscious, to attribute crimes wholly to oneself in which one has only had a partial hand,\u201d Flanery writes. A little earlier: \u201cHistory is not always correct, because it cannot tell all the stories that have been, cannot account or everything that has happened.\u201dLike in many powerful books, definitive answers remain elusive. The truth of memory, Flanery implies, is no less accurate than literal truth. This was the last book I read in 2012, but it soars to the top of my personal \u201cBest of 2012\u201d list. It has everything I look for: complex characters, important themes, arresting and often lyrical prose, and stunning craftsmanship."}, {"userName": "Jared", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8160635-jared", "userReview": "I really don't like giving bad reviews and wish I could give this 2.5 stars just to be neutral. I'm surprised that so many people have commented on how well he has portrayed South Africa and South Africans, as I found myself cringing regularly at the little things he gets wrong. That said, I think it would be very difficult, if not impossible, for someone to write perfectly about a place and people that are not their own - so, he should be congratulated on doing as well as he did. Patrick Flanery is undoubtedly a talented writer and this is an impressive first book. But I fear also that he has ruined himself by going as far as he did in academia. At the end I felt resentful, wondering if he wasn't simply using South Africa's past to make some academic comment on the politics of history/memory etc. I don't know if he did it on purpose, or perhaps just felt too daunted by the prospect, but black people are invisible in this book largely set during the struggle. I felt angry at the way he gave the few black characters that do appear such bland, weak portrayals - even when they're there they're almost invisible. One particular scene in the book has stuck with me as being painful to read. One of the main characters, Sam, is at a Jo'burg mall having dinner in 2009 (I think) and smiles at a black waitress, the waitress sinks below the counter overwhelmed, then has to retreat to a back room. Sam's wife asks what came over the young girl and Sam says he doesn't think she has ever been smiled at by a white man. This is supposed to be set in Rosebank, one of the more cosmopolitan neighbourhoods in South Africa and in 2009. It is ridiculously unrealistic and embarrassing to read, as a white South African male let alone as a young black woman I'm sure. Flanery obviously enjoys writing about South Africa and has studied the country for a long time, thus I'm sure we can all appreciate that writing about another country and culture is a massive task to get right, and unfortunately he just doesn't succeed. Sorry if that's too harsh, read the book and make up your own mind. There are definitely parts that make it a worthwhile read."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2375838-cheryl", "userReview": "This is a story of lives lived in ways which give cause for regret. This is becoming a genre. Ian McEwan talked about Atonement. Here the quest is for Absolution. In both cases memory and remembrances are fluid. They are fuzzy or not reliable. The quests for Atonement and Absolution become larger, more significant then the events that precipitated the need.Will this bring us to The Sense of an Ending? All of these books are characterised by muddy memories and relative truths, and unreliable authors within the stories.It\u2019s hard to believe that this is the first novel from Patrick Flanery. It is a self-assured and complex work that braids together the related stories of several characters. Clare is a famous South African author, a bit of a curmudgeon, who is working with her biographer. (If this was ever made into a movie, Maggie Smith would be perfect for the role.) She is using her own literary skills as a tool to clarify mysterious past events involving her family\u2019s roles in the political history of South Africa, but she is a bit obtuse with her young biographer who struggles to understand how his own life has figured into hers. Most of the novel leads to discovering why Clare feels the need for absolution.Flanery\u2019s writing is intelligent, incisive, and he can write a mean bit of suspenseful action. \u201cBefore killing you they would burn the names from your mouth, pull syllables from your fingernails, soak vowels and consonants from your nostrils, remind you of their authority with steel and wire, electricity and fire.\u201dThere was an intense scene of a home invasion, where you could almost hear the scared breathing trying not to be heard, the tense silence broken by stealthy creaks. Clare is interviewed by police afterward, and that becomes a brilliantly Kafka-esque interaction. There are wonderful gems of prose. On family: \u201cOne can but sow the seed and provide the proper environment, and hope that the flower promised by the illustration on the packet is the one that will grow, trust that the hybrid will not revert to the characteristics of some earlier generation, or be so transformed by unpredictable and wholly external factors \u2013 a drought, a storm, environmental pollution \u2013 that the seed mutates and something unrecognizable grows.\u201dOr when one\u2019s vacation plans are suddenly upset by a phone call with unexpected news: \u201cLying in bed that morning, the phone still in his hand, he could feel the broken expectation of that escape raining down around him, and then he realized the rain was not just in his head but outside the window, a shower of ice that began to coat the glass, contorting their view of the traffic, the canary sludge of taxis, bleeding brake lights along West End Avenue.\u201dAnd I loved this description of a minor character: \u201cTimothy is overripe and over-processed. His nails have been manicured, his suit is more expensive than anything I\u2019ll ever be able to afford. He\u2019s rotten with success.\u201dFlanery is American but writes convincingly of what daily life is like nowadays for some in cities like Capetown and Johannesburg. Some descriptions were so detailed that I followed along in Google Maps Streetview. That was an interesting exercise \u2014 I felt as if suddenly I was seeing the scene as the author saw it in his own mind. This book has been one of the best I\u2019ve read in a few months."}, {"userName": "Barry Gilder", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16634256-barry-gilder", "userReview": "There is no doubt that this book is beautifully written, cleverly structured, delicately observed and well-worth getting to the end of. (I read it in two days).It tells the story of a white South African man, academically educated in the United States, who returns to post-apartheid South Africa to engage with an elderly white South African woman author as a prelude to writing her biography. As the story unfolds the complex historical and personal interconnections between Clare - the woman author - and her biographer reveal themselves in a complex interplay of different perspectives, different rememberings, and different self-projections. As I got into the early chapters of the book I had already decided to give it four stars, but as I read on something began to bother me and my reading was progressively interrupted by longer moments of reflection, of trying to get my mental hands around what it quite was that bothered me.Before starting the book I noted the observation by a number of reviewers of the remarkable way in which Flanery, a non-South African, had captured the feel and detail of place, space, and the historical time trajectory that set the the scene of the novel. As a South African myself, I entered the book intrigued to find out how he did this and if he did so successfully. At a practical level, my conclusion was that Flanery must have spent a considerable time in South Africa with a voluminous notebook or a prodigious memory. I can't fault Flanery on his delicate and precise observation of place. But I felt increasingly discomforted by his portrayal of the historical, political and social context in which his characters engaged with each other and their world.For one thing, a South African author would have given more sense of the race and ethnicity of their characters. Given South Africa's history - and its current realities - race (without racism) is a key determinant of how South Africans understand themselves, understand others, and understand their surroundings. But one often struggles in this book to be sure of the race or ethnicity of many of the minor characters. Of course, it is clear that the major characters are white and there is a clear sense of the privilege and advantage that their whiteness entails. One almost gets the sense that Flanery, consciously or unconsciously, is trying to prove his own non-racism by refusing to clearly identify the ethnicity of his 'non-white' characters.For instance, the police woman assigned to investigate a house invasion experienced by the main character, Clare, is not clearly identified as a black woman. (In fact, she is named 'Ms White'). But it becomes clear from her resentful interactions with Clare that she is black. Her ethnicity dictates her attitudes, but why make the reader guess? Simplistic descriptions of characters as black or otherwise is not what I am advocating, but it is not difficult to clearly locate them in South African social hierarchies through description.Another minor, but telling, example is a small anecdote in the book - potentially quite poignant - in which the biographer, Sam, and his wife are in Sandton and overhear a child saying to its parents 'Do we really have to go back to South Africa?' But the poignancy of this observation is determined by knowing the ethnicity of the child and its parents. Seeing the space outside Sandton as South Africa and Sandton as somewhere else has significantly different meanings for a white child or a black child. Again, why must the reader guess?But Flanery's partial avoidance of the ethnicity of some of his characters is not what primarily bothered me about the book. It is only an observation that a South African author would have had less hesitation in understanding the importance to the reader of knowing the social standing (historical and present) of their characters.What really bothered me is that such a talented author should have failed to adequately convey the complexities and subtleties of the South African political and social context. For want of a less crude characterisation, the book is imbued with a white and European (including the Europeans who emigrated to north America centuries ago) perspective on the South African reality. The book seems to buy into the common, largely white, public discourse that post-apartheid South Africa is simply a country of crime and corruption. Certainly, it is acceptable that Flanery's main characters would perhaps have this view and the more progressive among them would feel some disappointment that the new South Africa does not fulfil the promise of their own ideals and values nurtured in their opposition to apartheid. This is a reasonable reflection of reality. But Flanery does not draw a clear line between the views of his characters and the realities and complexities beyond their own perceptions.Perhaps Flanery shares his characters' views of South Africa today, or perhaps he just got lost in his characters, but my concern is that readers of 'Absolution' will come away with a simple confirmation of the stylised and unmitigated view of democratic South Africa as a bitter disappointment and a place of ever-present danger, begging, crime, corruption and generalised evil. Perhaps, to be fair, that is how Flanery experienced South Africa during his visits there. If so, I must play the man rather than the book.All that being said, the book is exquisitely written and a good read, and my concerns only lost it one star."}, {"userName": "Chaitra", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9086236-chaitra", "userReview": "Absolution implies that there is a sin to be absolved. And guilt too, for the need to be absolved. I saw guilt in plenty, not so much the sin. I sure did not see any absolution. This is not an easy read. Flanery is writing about a difficult subject, in a technique that is difficult to read and to me, took away from the experience.The story is of Clare Wald, a South African author, who may or may not have been involved in committing a murder for political or personal reasons. She has commissioned a biography, and has chosen a South African expat in the US, Sam Leroux for the job. Both Clare and Sam are connected through Clare's daughter Laura, who may or may not have been involved in the violent anti-apartheid movement. She's now missing and is presumed dead. Sam, as a little boy, was among the last to see her. This much is established right at the beginning. This is pretty much all we know at the end. What we do know is that there's much subterfuge: both Clare and Sam do not acknowledge their link for more than three quarters of their book. Instead, they spend all their time talking about Clare's politics and censorship - irrelevant to the main story, if there was any. Sam, whose parents were neck deep in the anti-apartheid movement, has a secret that he doesn't tell anyone - even to Clare, he reveals it only partially. At the end of the book, Clare is left saying that she doesn't trust him, and she never will. She doesn't even think that her biography, in its published form, will be anything like the drafts he has shown her. As a reader, for me, this dishonesty is frustrating. It's worse because I have no inkling that there is anything to be dishonest about. Nor does Flanery reveal anything of anyone's intentions. He has four strains of narrative: One is Clare and Sam in present time, working on Clare's biography. It's narrated by Sam. The second, is something that is called Absolution which may or may not be pages of a may or may not be fictional book Clare has been writing at the same time as her commissioned biography. In this, Clare seeks absolution from her son, to what she may or may not have done to her sister Nora and her husband Stephan. This may or may not be personal in nature. Her son too has absolution to seek of his mother for what he may or may not have done to his sister Laura. The third, is a section called Clare, which is a diary Clare writes to her daughter piecing together what may or may not have happened to Laura, based on what she can read from the notebooks Laura left her. The notebooks may or may not be true. The fourth section, is presumably what did happen to Laura all those years ago. This is told through the eyes of the child Sam, and he is an unreliable narrator at best. See the difficulty? Everything is up in the air. The sections are difficult to manage and reconcile. In fact, nothing seems to easy to settle, not a single thread of the story, which may be true of real life. But, as a book, it's very pointless. In addition to the threads above, there are a couple of other things introduced, other mysteries. These are not solved either, and I fail to understand why they're even included. They add nothing to the story or to our grasp of the characters in the book. Unless this is a South African thing that flies above my head. There are a lot of side characters who are introduced. We even spend considerable time with them, only to have them disappear completely from the narrative without so much as a good-bye. There's a lot of vague mention about the politics of the country, but nothing more than a hint there or a nudge here. Is Flanery trying to say that pre-independence South Africa was better than the republic? Or is it vice versa? Or did anything have to do with politics at all? The state of the republic is pretty obvious - no one is secure, people beg, corruption rampant. On the other hand, South Africa during the anti-apartheid movement also wasn't about security and freedom of speech. But, bringing this up in this particular book, and the way it's been pushed into the narrative, it basically feels like lip service - there only because it's set in South Africa.As it stands, reading this book was a complete waste of time. I give it two stars, because I think there was something there. Only, I don't have the time or the inclination to figure it out."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2352900-elaine", "userReview": "This is a book of extraordinary power and intensity. I don't know if I was more surprised to learn that the author was a first-time novelist or that he was not South African -- the book conveys an amazing nuanced sense of place and history, and is written with serious maturity and talent. This book will break your heart, with its tales of betrayal, loss and missed chances, both historical and familial, and stretch your mind, as the maze of its interconnecting narratives show just how flimsy historical \"truth\" is (and in the process seriously interrogate (on several levels) just what a \"Truth and Reconciliation Commission\" could accomplish). There are also parts of this novel that will have your hair standing on end and your heart pounding, whether it's the vivid depiction of a home invasion (or the constant fear of one) or the reminiscing/imagining that the characters do about the violence done and tortures inflicted by the apartheid regime, as well as some of its opponents. In addition to conveying fear and paranoia beautifully, I thought the sense of loss was masterfully done. I felt keenly both the personal loss that the missed connections and betrayals great and small between parent and child, brother and sister, and sister and sister, engender, and the great historical loss of South Africa, where a dream worth dying for has become ( at least in this telling) a harrowing dystopia, and where (in a neat touch) some of its most radical revolutionaries are now floridly middle-aged and work for the Tourism Board, while others are still lost in unmarked graves.Most of this book is one of the most impressive books I've read in a long time -- but it just missed a five because the 2nd half is not as tightly constructed, and as heartstoppingly harrowing as the first. The conceits are a bit more dragged out, some passages are overwritten and some of the revelations (and concealments) are a long time coming. Nonetheless, I think it's remarkable, likely bears re-reading, and Flanery's 2nd novel is eagerly awaited!"}, {"userName": "James Murphy", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2422285-james-murphy", "userReview": "Near the end of Patrick Flanery's novel Absolution is a short discourse on the inability of history to tell all the stories and about the truth that memory always tells. The two points are at the heart of Flanery's complex novel. It's a novel about modern South Africa set a dozen years ago when the Truth and Reonciliation Commission was working hard at damage control after the long, hard years of apartheid. But it's one in which racial injustices aren't the focus. The narrative follows, instead, the revelations and confession of wrongs within a family. Though the racial issue smoulders in the background, South Africa isn't seen through its prism but rather through the hellishness of its criminal activity, robberies, killings, home invasions, and the general danger of city streets. Every home has become a fortress of walls, double gates, and security devices, including panic buttons in every room. It's a bleak, frightening portrait of the country. The menace and impersonality of the state Flanery writes about recalls Kafka. Clare, one of the central characters, is writing a fictionalized memoir telling about her unforgivable betrayal of family members in the past. Sam, an academic, is writing a biography of Clare and remembering disturbing events loosely connected to hers. How Flanery brings these two strands together, two characters achieving absolution through confession and realizations of love while frenzied crime and fear swirl outside, threatening to spill over walls and in doors, is the novel's core.It's a well-written novel, tightly structured and controlled. One hiccup of objection: it's a novel of dialogue, discussion, confession and quiet disagreement behind and between walls, thick protective walls of stucco making compounds around houses, blank walls within the house, and sometimes the stark characters tend to lose their energy and to blend into the stark walls. But it's a tiny thing in a first novel otherwise nicely done."}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "Truth, Reconciliation, and AuthenticityShortly after the elections of 1994 effectively ended Apartheid, the unity government set up a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) designed to bring to light human rights violations on all sides and also, in appropriate situations, to offer amnesty. The work of the TRC makes several appearances in Patrick Flanery's ambitious and in many ways extraordinary debut novel, which spans four decades from the Apartheid era to the present day. But more than that, the entire book is about the search for truth, the reshaping of truth, and the reconciliation that is only possible when a single version of that truth emerges. Or, in the words of Flanery's title, Absolution.Sam Leroux, a South African born but American educated academic, returns to Cape Town to write the biography of the intimidating grande dame of South African letters, the novelist Clare Wald. (Yes, there are certainly similarities to Nadine Gordimer in Flanery's portrait, but even more differences.) The two dance around each other for weeks, partly due to Clare's aloof reticence, but partly because theirs is not a random connection, and each knows facts impacting the other's life that they prefer to keep secret. These center around the disappearance of Clare's daughter Laura, an anti-apartheid activist who may have been involved in terrorist activities in the 1980s. Clare has acquired her daughter's diaries, but Sam may have had a more immediate connection.What follows is one of the most extraordinary approaches to storytelling I have read in some time, an absolute orgy of unreliable narrators. Flanery cycles between short chapters headed respectively \"Sam,\" \"Clare,\" \"Absolution,\" and with the date of a year. At first, it is hard to see what the differences are between them, only that they contradict each other in important ways. \"Sam\" has the confused memories of a child. The \"Clare\" sections contain the novelist's often lurid fictional recreations of her daughter's last days. \"Absolution\" will turn out to be chapters of published memoir in which Clare presents aspects of her life, using her own name and those of her family, but steadfastly maintaining the guise of fiction. A ridiculously artificial construct, one might think, except that this is exactly how J. M. Coetzee treated his own years in South Africa in his recent novel Summertime.The whole book thus becomes a search for authenticity: which perspective is correct? But the paradox is that every viewpoint shines with the authenticity either of imagination or of fact. I admit that I was disturbed at first to discover that the author, an American now living in London, is not South African himself, so cannot have the authenticity of personal experience; could I trust him the way I do Coetzee or Gordimer or Damon Galgut? But soon my skepticism disappeared. Flanery certainly convinces me with his picture of South Africa today as a country where the rich live behind electrified fences and refrigerators are sold with locks to prevent the domestics from stealing food. And there is the monstrous obscenity of Apartheid hanging over everything, which is surely fact enough for anyone.It is not quite a perfect book. Flanery tends to give his characters, especially Clare, overlong speeches that read more like manifestos. The rapid switches can be confusing at the beginning, and not everything is cleared up at the end. But it is an extraordinary achievement for a first novel. In addition to the authors mentioned above, I thought of Peter Carey, and Russell Banks, and Thomas Kennedy, and Richard Powers, and quite a few politically-committed European writers, from Kafka to Kertesz. It will take several more novels to discern where Flanery's personal authenticity will lead him, but there is nothing trivial about this first beginning."}, {"userName": "Featherbooks", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1135467-featherbooks", "userReview": "\"Dostoevsky says that everyone remembers things he would only confide to his friends, and other things he would only reveal to himself...But there are other things which a man is afraid to tell even to himself.\" In Absolution a first novel about memory and guilt and censorship, the author has produced a stunning, compelling tale of an aging South African author, Clare, and her biographer, Sam, told in multiple points of view. Absolution brought the country and its tragic past to life as much as anything I've read by classic authors such asCOETZEE JOHN M. and Nadine Gordimer. The characters were well-drawn and the plot moved forward sometimes at rapid pace as I flipped ahead, unable to await the resolution of an incident, the clues to a possible future. The writing is very good and Clare's voice rings true.

Truth is a messy matter as the truth and reconciliation hearings found out and this book illuminates that."}, {"userName": "CuteBadger", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4084869-cutebadger", "userReview": "Clare Wald is a South African author coming to the end of her life who has agreed to be involved in the writing of her biography. It is to be written by Sam Leroux, a fellow South African now returning to the country of his birth after some years' absence. Revisiting the past brings up old secrets for both of them and they must be truthful with themselves about the part they played in disturbing events.This novel has four different narrative strands, which makes things complicated at times, especially when the strands contradict each other. There are several mysteries in the book, but one main mystery is examined from different points of view and the events connected to it are re-told in a number of different ways. However, the events seem to be less important than what the characters think about them, and it is a novel in which the characters think much more than they say. I found this more than a little frustrating as it meant getting to the truth about what happened was impossible. I felt that the complex structure was a hindrance rather than a help to the book, but that the detail with which the characters were described almost made up for this. But although the reader is let into what the characters think, I was left with a niggling sense that they might not be being truthful, even to themselves, so perhaps what they tell us isn't wholly reliable. In short, they're human and we have to make up our minds about them from the available evidence.I didn't feel a sense of resolution when I got to the end of the book and felt that the end was quite weak compared to the build up of the bulk of the novel. However, I found it an interesting character portrait of how people react in unimaginable circumstances and a detailed study of post-apartheid South Africa."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/198932-brian", "userReview": "Set in post-apartheid South Africa, Absolution focuses on a series of meetings between elderly writer, Clare Wald, and her recently-appointed biographer, Samuel Leroux. However at the real heart of the novel lies the fate of Laura, Clare's daughter. Missing, presumed dead, Laura was actively involved in the liberation struggle and her life intersected dramatically with Sam's childhood, though we only learn the full significance of this intersection as the novel progresses and the truth about Sam's, Clare's and Laura's inter-connected pasts begins to emerge from a number of over-lapping and conflicting narratives. Even by the end of the book, however, several important questions are left only partially answered and the reader is forced to draw his or her own conclusions.Patrick Flanery paints an arresting picture of contemporary South Africa as a society riven by violent crime in which the white middle class have barricaded themselves within fortress-like compounds whose every room is equipped with a panic button.It's not a comfortable read and the ending is in many ways unsatisfactory. Nevertheless, this is a compelling, challenging and disturbing account of the corrosive effect the apartheid regime exercised, and still continues to exercise, on both South Africa's black and white communities."}, {"userName": "Kasa Cotugno", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2345554-kasa-cotugno", "userReview": "One of the best books I've read. There are three major characters, two of whom, Sam and Clare, are unreliable narrators, and Clare's daughter Laura who lives only in their memory. The intricate, violent, complicated final days of apartheid in South Africa are rendered in four platforms, through narrative fiction and memoir. Lies are told and truths distorted. The story unravels but not in Roshomon fashion. The truth is elusive, as elusive as memories of Laura and her motivations. What is truly remarkable about this book is that it is a debut novel, and further, that Flanery did not grow up in Cape Town or experience first hand the times he writes so eloquently about. This is a novel that shows promise beyond that of most first time outings.

There was no real sense of anyone actually wanting to improve the lives of those around them. I had no sympathy with any character at all. The scope of the book was so narrow when it should have been so broad. There was no attempt to include poor or black characters in the narrative, just white middle class navel gazers.

However, I was not sure it benefited from the complicated structure as it was. I normally enjoy the multiple points of view. But here you have a novel within the novel on the top of it and I found it a bit distractive. Also I think the main character, Sam could be more developed. I did not understand his relationship with his wife. It came across as he uses her rather than loves her. But I was not sure whether it was the impression the author wanted to create. On the other hand, Clare's character is wonderfully developed and very original.So for the part of this novel did not add up to something whole. But I enjoyed it anyway and it made me think, especially about the choices the creative people have to make under the repressive regimes.Quotes:\"Political orientation is an ellipse, not a continuum.

I almost stopped reading the book but forced myself to go to at least page 50; by then the storyline had begun to take shape. I think the problem for me is that this is in part an intellectual book, and I generally prefer to read mysteries and action oriented books. At times it was painful for me to witness the Clare and Sam not being able to come out with what they were thinking. Clare was an especially inconsistent character-- she could be so knowing and assertive, and then she would be really dependent and insecure. And then, all of a sudden, at the end of the story the threads came together.

The beginning was very jumbly and confusing - which I think the author meant to use as a technique to give the reader a feel for the multiple angles and confusion caused by trying to figure things out in hindsight, as well as from multiple points of view. It took that 100 pages for me to really sink into the groove of the story, to understand the perspectives and to care about the characters. I'm glad I read it, but it wasn't easy!As for the story - it's a compelling look at the difficult decisions that people are forced to make when society has created a monster such as apartheid.

I agree with someone who commented that it would have been more appropriate to mention the race of the characters (the police detective Mrs. White) as so much of the topic of the book is based on race.

Clare comes to learn that in this conflict the dead do not stay buried, and the missing return in other forms--such as the small child present in her daughter's last days who has reappeared, posing as Clare's official biographer. Sam Leroux, a South African expatriate returning to Cape Town after many years in New York, gradually earns Clare's trust, his own ghosts emerging from the histories that he and Clare begin to unravel, leading them both along a path in search of reconciliation and forgiveness.", "title": "Absolution", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13073575-absolution", "average": 3.61, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327952526l/13073575.jpg", "reviews": 204, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4800425.Patrick_Flanery", "name": "Patrick Flanery"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Southern Africa", "Literary Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13073575-absolution", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13597697-absolution", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13505729-absolution", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11156874-absolution", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28929115-i-am-no-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707696-fallen-land", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34940897-i-am-no-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34725030-ich-bin-niemand", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40209166-terra-oscura", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
