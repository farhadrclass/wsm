Really, she is one of my favorite authors, but she writes about Oklahoma in a way that makes me proud to live here. Most of Carolyn Brown's books are romances published by Avalon Press which I believe is out of business. Hidden Secrets is published by Montlake Romance and not really a romance though it does contain romance. Hidden Secrets is the story of four generations of women who on the spur of the moment agree to spend the summer in Oklahoma to manage a farm which is left to Hannah Brewer by a distant cousin she has never mentioned before. The women leave their lavish lifestyles in West Virginia for various reasons with hidden secrets. Eighty year old Hannah wants to relive the summer she turned sixteen on her previous visit to Oklahoma where she met Norma Andrews. Hannah's daughter, sixty year old Karen Tarleton, is in the middle of a messy divorce and battle over a winery that she owns with her husband. Karen's forty year old daughter, Sue DeHaven, is a widowed school teacher needing something to fill her summer break. Sue's twenty year old daughter, Kim DeHaven, needs the summer to tell her perfect family that she is pregnant and the father is getting married to someone else. None of them imagine that they will stay in Oklahoma beyond the summer."}, {"userName": "Cassie Chism", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12814788-cassie-chism", "userReview": "Great story...Very easy reading.

It was fun yet a bit intriguing. The first few chapters I had a bit of issues to get thru to them, because for some reason they made the book feel predictable, but as I kept reading this book kept throwing curb balls that made every prediction fade away and left me wanting to keep reading and not put it down.I had a hard time at the beginning with Nana Hannah, she was too bossy, and annoying somehow, but as the story developes I finally understood her and she grew big on me. What can I say I love Nana Hannah as I love the rest of the ladies in the Brewer family and friends. As secrets were being revealed life started to change for them, they went from feeling guilty to feeling free Thanks to Norma, who after her death she left everything set for the Brewer girls to have some sort of life change from the way they were living. Thia womens were loving, stubborn and hard headed, but most of all they were independent and decided to make a life of their own and not just settle for what they thought was going to be correct from others people point of view."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5493340-teresa", "userReview": "Just perfect!These four generations of ladies really deserved happy endings.

Based on the description I thought there would be some angst and a lot to do with the pregnancy. But..... yeah that's not what this was. EVERY problem felt like my 8 and 10 year olds wrote it. It was THE WORST THING EVER!!!!!! Only in the very next sentence it was like \"oh, nope it's fine - actually better than fine!\". Ugh.... It was SO frustrating. The jump between time periods was odd too. There were very subtle clues or no clues that we had jumped a week or so in time until a few sentences into the chapter. I didn't get it, didn't find it all that compelling and was glad to be done with it."}, {"userName": "Lisa ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5787545-lisa", "userReview": "I read Carolyn Brown's The Wedding Pearls book and it was decent. I am not sure why but this book felt like I was re-reading that book - the plot was almost identical. Relatives die, inherit stuff, get re-aquainted with each other and some people fall in love and some die. I am pretty sure it is the same plot with just new character names, a new town and slightly different variances. It was difficult to finish this one, but I did. I was listening to it on audio while cleaning. I had to make myself finish it. Had I not read the other book first I would give it a higher rating. I am a little leery to read any more books by this author because of this."}, {"userName": "Marcus Zottola", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39609952-marcus-zottola", "userReview": "I suspect many aspects of this story are predictable and/or generic, but I had a blast listening to this in audiobook form. Perhaps it's because I'm not as well read as other people.This is my second Carolyn Brown book, the first being The Barefoot Summer. It has many of the same qualities with a bit of southern flavor thrown in. The tale is very heart-warming and sweet, telling of four women discovering a new life away from their old town and learning each other's flaws. The conflict is not quite as intense as in other stories, but then that's not really the point.These two books have made me a Carolyn Brown fan. I'll be checking out several other books of her from here on out."}, {"userName": "Abby ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223499-abby", "userReview": "I listened to this book and at first it took me a minute to get into the story. I'm from the south. I've been surrounded by southern drawls my entire life. The narrator's drawl, sort of distracted me from the story at the beginning. I finally got used to it and remembered who was who. The Brewer women have always put the ones that came before them up on a pedestal. Their summer adventure allowed the women to get to know each other and share things they otherwise didn't know. They also learned things about themselves. It was good for them to get out of West Virginia. It was a sweet story."}, {"userName": "terri cornwell", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75695994-terri-cornwell", "userReview": "Secrets to love and keep you involved...As I began to listen to the audio version of this book I was delighted to Find that the story begins in Morgantown West Virginia where I went to To the University, And then lived after I was married and had my 2nd child there.
