This remoteness comes home even when the omniscient narrator refers to white people as Goras. In fact, I had difficulty with this narrator who kept indiscriminately popping in and out of the heads of the characters, both principal and minor alike, reducing them to cardboard cut-outs in places. This was the one flaw in an otherwise well crafted novel with slices of Indian life and dialogue that is fresh, humorous and insightful.The span of the action covers the greater part of the 20th century and many time periods and events in the lives of the characters are skimmed over to zero in only on key ones. Hence we do not hear much of the birth of Nimmo\u2019s daughter Kamal, but we get a drawn out scene of Bibi-ji and Pa-ji\u2019s visit to the school principal to discuss their adopted son Jasbir\u2019s misbehaviour.The private tensions in the lives of the three women are reflections of the wider conflicts facing the newly independent India, both internally between its diverse citizens, and externally with its neighbours, even between its distant exiles in Canada. The indiscriminate loss of life in this conflict also comes home sharply when key people start dropping like flies from chapter to chapter.In the end, the survivors are left bereft and horribly changed and the only person finding redemption from the conflict is Jasbir, the bad apple in the family who left to join the Khalistan rebellion, and finds his way back home after seeing the damage that the movement, its actions and consequences wreak on his own family. When I put this book down, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that as much as the author was humouring me with scenes of domesticity and social intercourse in Indian society both at home and abroad, she was hammering me with some brutal lessons of history that I never got to read about from the inside."}, {"userName": "Zara Garcia-Alvarez of The Bibliotaphe Closet Blog", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5971858-zara-garcia-alvarez-of-the-bibliotaphe-closet-blog", "userReview": "What began as a somewhat hopeful book, quickly and devastatingly spiralled into a travesty. I was left with the shock of death and loss for all characters and after reading the novel I was angry at its historical injustices.At the same time, I regretted investing emotional attachments to characters who were deeply flawed. My sense of the novel's downfall lay at the heart of the characters' weakness to pride.From Harjot Singh's listlessness and \"disappearance\" long before he actually decided to leave his family because of his wounded pride of not being able to land at the shores of Vancouver once arriving by the Komagata Maru.To his daughter, Sharanjeet (Bibi-ji) Kaur, who privately resents her station in life and her duties, unhappy to be obedient to her mother or selfless to her sister, Kanwar. But this attitude is not entirely due to her spoiled upbringing, but rather an internal pride, vanity, and materialistic ambition that drives her to steal her sister's marriage prospect, Khushwant (Pa-ji) Singh and eventually her niece's own son, Jasbeer.Leela (Shastri) Bhat is ostracized by her grandmother, Akka, and her father's relatives because she is considered a \"half-breed,\" a daughter of a Punjab, Hari Shastri and an English woman, Rosa Schweers. And rather than accept her genetic fate and cultural liminality, she loathes her own grey eyes, fair skin, and \"White\" culture. Instead she prides herself in becoming the wife of a prosperous and prestigious man, Balachandra (Balu) Bhat, who comes from a well known Punjab family and high caste, and submerges herself in adhering to Indian traditional practices. Leela, opposite of Bibi-ji, resents being pulled from her home in India to Vancouver, fearful of becoming yet again, nameless. Yet, though she suffered racial cruelty from her Indian grandmother, she fails to understand and accept her son's choice in marriage to an English woman.These and other characters provide a backdrop to the cruelty and harshness of the warring factions of the Hindu, Muslim, and Sikh people, which led to The Partition of India (with its Hindu majority) and Pakistan (with its Muslim majority). Violent acts of brutality by government and militant groups climaxed to the eventual killings of pilgrims at the Golden Temple. This act in itself prompted the assassination of Prime Minister, Indira Ghandi, which then led to vengeful killings of Sikhs throughout India. And a year later, Air India Flight 182 is bombed killing 329 people on board from Canada over the Atlantic Ocean.Perhaps it was Badami's intent to situate her characters at the \"wrong time in the wrong place,\" but also to propel them forward into devastation and loss due to extremely wrong choices that stem from deeply rooted pride and discord.The book is without resolution. It is merely a haunting reminder of the brutality and injustice of war, the interconnectedness between people, their actions, and their consequences, and the cost of life for the sake of land, name, autonomy, and religious freedom, where moderation seems to be the best answer, though rarely used.It's a novel of extremes, but then again, extremity is at the heart of this book's subject and a lesson of tempering it, is still yet to be learned."}, {"userName": "Carolyn Gerk", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2105161-carolyn-gerk", "userReview": "I picked this book up knowing very little about it, thinking that it was the story of families coming to Canada from India, and their struggles to belong. I admit I didn't exactly research it, it was given to me by a friend, and I thought, hey, free book!I was surprised to find out that it is primarily a historic account of the turbulent history of Punjab since the beginning of the 20th century. I know very little of the history of India's turmoil, I have heard pieces here and there but have not followed up. The last major plot point occurs the year I was born, so this history has never been something that has surfaced in my lifetime. Having read this novel, I found myself interested and intrigued by the events of the past as well as by the fictional aspects. The characters though, at times, somewhat trying and distant, evolve (or, as the case may be, remain the same) throughout an ever changing backdrop of tribulations and instability. We follow Sharan-jeet (Bibi-ji), Leela, and Nimmo as they struggle to belong, integrate, hold onto the past and in some cases, survive. The stories of the three women are interwoven neatly and rather predictably, but the draws of the novel need not be plot twists. The draw, for me, is the picture painted for the reader of women holding fast to their families and their beliefs (be those religion, or the belief that one must belong) as the world sweeps past them without care. At times hopeful and just as often, frighteningly tragic, this book is reminiscent of the theme of Leela's life: half and half. One foot in malleable fiction, the other in the harsh, unchangeable portrait of reality. An interesting read for those who want to learn about the modern history of India without having to peruse textbooks full of paragraph after paragraph of dull script. Nightbird allowed me a view into a world I knew very little of. It allowed me a history lesson wrapped up in the package of a fictional story about women, family and change."}, {"userName": "Catherine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2206192-catherine", "userReview": "This was a tragic story that kept my attention from beginning to end. The characters are flawed yet likeable, and it was the type of novel that left me thinking long after I had finished. This is a fictional account woven amid real historical events, so I learned a lot about India in the mid-80s...a period of time in which I was a teenager and blissfully unaware of some of the drama unfolding around the world.

I picked it up because it was the only novel of hers that I had not read, but it turned out be a very timely read that made me reflect further on many questions of immigration. This is a powerful novel that explores the Hindu and Sikh violence in the early 80's involving the assassination of Indira Gandhi, the formation of the Sikh separatist movement of Khalistan, and the downing of Air India flight 182. The immigrant experience viewed through the eyes of 3 women, 2 of which immigrate to Canada, one of which stays in India, brings its reality close to the reader's heart. Immigration now always seems to be linked with violence of some sort, whether it is open conflict, or the more subtle conflict, at times, of racism - this experience always seems to be a highly emotional one. This novel is a very powerful one in the sense that it gives you the opportunity to examine all aspects, all points of view."}, {"userName": "Crabbygirl", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22614843-crabbygirl", "userReview": "when you heard about (or see a movie about) partition, you always hear about the muslims and the hindus, but not much about the sikhs. coming from brampton, i should already have a good cultural understanding of the sikhs, but i don't. so i was glad to read this book and learn about the punjab, and it's splitting in 2, and the attack within the golden temple, and the tragedy that happened in new delhi after indira gandhi was shot... the plot may have moved to obvious places, and the characters may have become too one-sided, but the author did a great job of giving a pan-view: from before partition up to the air india bombing. i've also recently reflected on the insult-du-jour when i was in highschool: paki. now i wonder if it was hate-based in a faith (muslim) rather than ethnicity (indian. well, really, pakistani but it was applied to any east indian you wanted to jeer). numerous insults could have been chosen - but this was the choice of many"}, {"userName": "Avery", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67554009-avery", "userReview": "Can you hear the Nightbird call? is slow to start and the characters aren\u2019t very likeable until later.

Needless to say, it is a beautiful story that taught me so much about about the history of India that I knew nothing about, as well as Air India Flight 182 which I had never heard of until discussing it in class a bit before we read this book.The three heroines followed in the story: Sharanjeet (a.k.a. Bibi-ji), Leela, and Nimmo all varied so much from each other. I greatly enjoyed the different perspectives and different mind set of each of the characters. It was interesting to read Canada being read as a place of freedom as well as a place of exile. I enjoyed knowing the characters as they grew as well as their own personal histories which made them all unique.I also really enjoyed reading about the religion, mythology, beliefs, and history in the text. I know very little about India, but it was very interesting for me to get to learn about these new things in a beginners sense. The mention of Air India Flight 182 was also very important. This tragic event happened in the 1980s and yet I haven\u2019t heard of it until this year. It brings to light all that my country has hidden.The story was however slow at times, but I blame that more on my lack of knowledge on the history than on Badami\u2019s part.Can You Hear The Nightbird Call? is an excellent novel which explores the complexities of India\u2019s history as well as a not so distant past in Canada that is already forgotten."}, {"userName": "Smitha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2481560-smitha", "userReview": "It was an okay read, not as good as Badami's other novel, which I recently read [tell it to the trees]. The time period is 1920s-1980s - a turbulent period for India - the struggle for freedom, achieving the same but at great cost, and the subsequent slow deterioration in Hindu-Sikh relationship. These events highly determine the fate of the characters. Bibi jee was born a beautiful, though penniless girl, with an ordinary looking ugly sister. She managed to change her fate by snatching her sister's Canadian groom with just a flutter of her eyelashes, the event which cost her and her family dearly later on. The story follows her early life, marriage, migration to Canada, loss of her family back in India during Hindu-Muslim partition riots, the restaurant she manages successfully in Canada and finally arrival of a tenant Leela, who plays an important role in subsequent events. Leela's story is also told, but not in as much details. I enjoyed the book, till the last quarter, where it diverted to the growing Hindu - Sikh rivalry, murder of Indira Gandhi and the gory events that followed later on. I always get depressed when I read about riots involving people of India. I hate the rivalry based upon religion. I wish all were same, or atleast there was some mechanism in our brains which would shut up our thoughts when we start thinking badly about others."}, {"userName": "Kris - My Novelesque Life", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6275022-kris---my-novelesque-life", "userReview": "4 STARS \"gantly moves back and forth between the growing desi community in Vancouver and the increasingly conflicted worlds of Punjab and Delhi, where rifts between Sikhs and Hindus are growing.

While they are there, the temple is stormed by Indian government troops attempting to contain Sikh extremists hiding inside the temple compound. The results are devastating.Then, in October of the same year, Indira Gandhi is murdered by her two Sikh bodyguards, an act of vengeance for the assault on the temple.

The book covers the lives of three women, beginning in the 1920s in pre-Partition India and culminating in the mid-80s, with the explosion of Air Indian Flight 182, an event that most American readers likely don't know about or will have forgotten; I'd say the equivalent is Pan Am disaster over Lockerbie. So, this isn't a book with a happy ending, just in case you were wondering. With three lives, two continents and sixty-some years, the book might feel superficial to some readers. Badami constructs the story around specific moments in history, but she never sacrifices character to the larger story. With surprising economy, she manages to invest the reader in all three of the characters--SharanJeet (who becomes Bibi-ji in Vancouver), Leela, and Nimmo. Bibi-ji is the main character; her deepest flaw, desire for things/people which she has no right to, sets the story in motion. The other women are not as well-defined, though they have their weaknesses. But it's Bibi-ji who inflicts the most hurt on others.I was curious to see how the writer would tie all the events together; I expected something contrived, but the ending was surprisingly moving.

I was fairly familiar with the Air India bombing from media coverage, but really didn't understand the Indian side of that story. I loved the juxtaposition of private decisions (the stealing of a sister's fiance, the giving up of a son for adoption in the hope that he'll have a better life) played out against the unfolding of historical events that the characters are often helpless to resist.

It was hard to read of the injustices faced by the Sikh community in India and Canada after the assassination of Indira Gandhi."}], "description": "Set against the tumultuous backdrop of a fragmenting Punjab and moving between Canada and India, Can you Hear the Nightbird Call? charts the interweaving stories of three Indian women \u2013 Bibi-ji, Leela and Nimmo \u2013 each in search of a resting place amid rapidly changing personal and political landscapes.The ambitious, defiant Sikh Bibi-ji, born Sharanjeet Kaur in a Punjabi village, steals her sister Kanwar\u2019s destiny, thereby gaining passage to Canada.Leela Bhat, born to a German mother and a Hindu father, is doomed to walk the earth as a \"half-and-half.\" Leela\u2019s childhood in Bangalore is scarred by her in-between identity and by the great unhappiness of her mother, Rosa, an outcast in their conservative Hindu home. Years after Rosa\u2019s shadowy death, Leela has learned to deal with her in-between status, and she marries Balu Bhat, a man from a family of purebred Hindu Brahmins, thus acquiring status and a tenuous stability. However, when Balu insists on emigrating to Canada, Leela must trade her newfound comfort for yet another beginning. Once in Vancouver with her husband and two children, Leela\u2019s initial reluctance to leave home gradually evolves.While Bibi-ji gains access to a life of luxury in Canada, her sister Kanwar, left behind to weather the brutal violence of the Partition of India and Pakistan in 1947, is not so fortunate. She disappears, leaving Bibi-ji bereft and guilt-ridden.Meanwhile, a little girl, who just might be Kanwar\u2019s six-year-old daughter Nimmo, makes her way to Delhi, where she is adopted, marries and goes on to build a life with her loving husband, Satpal. Although this existence is constantly threatened by poverty, Nimmo cherishes it, filled as it is with love and laughter, and she guards it fiercely.Across the world, Bibi-ji is plagued by unhappiness: she is unable to have a child. She believes that it is her punishment for having stolen her sister\u2019s future, but tries to drown her sorrows by investing all her energies into her increasingly successful restaurant called the Delhi Junction. This restaurant becomes the place where members of the growing Vancouver Indo-Canadian community come to dispute and discuss their pasts, presents and futures.Over the years, Bibi-ji tries to uncover her sister Kanwar\u2019s fate but is unsuccessful until Leela Bhat \u2013 carrying a message from Satpal, Nimmo\u2019s husband \u2013 helps Bibi-ji reconnect with the woman she comes to believe is her niece \u2013 Nimmo. Used to getting whatever she has wanted from life, Bibi-ji subtly pressures Nimmo into giving up Jasbeer, her oldest child, into her care.Eight-year old Jasbeer does not settle well in Vancouver. Resentful of his parents\u2019 decision to send him away, he finds a sense of identity only in the stories , of Sikh ancestry, real and imagined, told to him by Bibi-ji\u2019s husband, Pa-ji. Over the years, his childish resentments harden, and when a radical preacher named Dr. Randhawa arrives in Vancouver, preaching the need for a separate Sikh homeland, Jasbeer is easily seduced by his violent rhetoric.Can You Hear the Nightbird Call? elegantly moves back and forth between the growing desi community in Vancouver and the increasingly conflicted worlds of Punjab and Delhi, where rifts between Sikhs and Hindus are growing. In June 1984, just as political tensions within India begin to spiral out of control, Bibi-ji and Pa-ji decide to make their annual pilgrimage to the Golden Temple in Amritsar, the holiest of Sikh shrines. While they are there, the temple is stormed by Indian government troops attempting to contain Sikh extremists hiding inside the temple compound. The results are devastating.Then, in October of the same year, Indira Gandhi is murdered by her two Sikh bodyguards, an act of vengeance for the assault on the temple. The assassination sets off a wave of violence against innocent Sikhs.The tide of anger and violence spills across borders and floods into distant Canada, and into the lives of neighbours Bibi-ji and Leela. Can You Hear the Nightbird Call? weaves together the personal and the political \u2013 and beautifully brings the reader into the reality of terrorism and religious intolerance. \nBibi-ji turned to gaze out at the street. They could become far more prosperous, she was sure of that. Opportunities lay around them like pearls on these streets. But they were visible only to people with sharp eyes.\u201cWhat are you looking at, Bibi-ji?\u201d Lalloo asked, coming around to the front with a box full of pickle jars. He lowered it carefully on the floor and stared out the window.\u201cWhat am I looking for, Lalloo, for,\u201d Bibi-ji corrected. \u201cI am looking for pearls.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t see anything there, Bibi-ji,\u201d Lalloo remarked after a few moments.She laughed. \u201cNeither do I, but I will. I know I will.\u201d The war had left the whole world poorer: why had Pa-ji not thought of opening a used-clothing store instead of this Indian grocery shop? She wondered whether the shop would do better in Abbotsford or in Duncan, where there were more Sikhs than here in Vancouver. But no, she had a feeling that it was a city with a future, one in which she would be wise to invest her money and her hard work.\u2013from Can You Hear the Nightbird Call?From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "Can You Hear the Nightbird Call?", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/473846.Can_You_Hear_the_Nightbird_Call_", "average": 3.95, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320435935l/473846.jpg", "reviews": 78, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/83925.Anita_Rau_Badami", "name": "Anita Rau Badami"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Cultural", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/473846.Can_You_Hear_the_Nightbird_Call_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1224261.Can_You_Hear_the_Nightbird_Call_", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/335915.The_Hero_s_Walk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11539637-tell-it-to-the-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1043382.Tamarind_Woman"]}
