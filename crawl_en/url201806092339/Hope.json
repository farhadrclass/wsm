The author pulls you into the story and makes you really care for the characters and their circumstances.What I liked: Clint and Jessica were both easy to like. Jessica has a strong personality, with a positive outlook on life in spite of the fact that she has already seen tragedy. Clint is the typical \u201cknight in shining armor\u201d who comes to Jessica\u2019s rescue and protects her throughout the book. You get a hint of suspense in the beginning of the book, and it only builds from there.What I didn\u2019t like: While the language is not dirty by any means, I did find myself questioning several of the words the author used. There were a couple of romantic circumstances that made me question whether they should have been included in a Christian book. But my standards are high, and other readers may not feel so inclined to agree with my review.Over all, I give the book four stars, and I would definitely read another book by this author. I recommend it to anyone loving a good romantic mystery."}, {"userName": "Daphne Self", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5552166-daphne-self", "userReview": "I watched this novel grow form first line to its final. It's not your typical mystery. It's not your typical romance. It's not your typical novel.Jessica needed a new life. What she received was a new hope, a new love, a new chapter, basically a renewing of spirit.Jo Walker has a way that sucks you into a story. This was no cozy mystery. I was surprised to discover the \"ghost\"; but looking back the clues were there. This was no simple romance. Jessica finds love in the most surprising places, most of all from God. The budding relationship between Jessica, Clint, and Timmy was heartwarming.A line from the book: \"like a gentle rain bringing peace in the middle of turmoil\", Hope gives the reader just that, hope. Hope for a future. Hope fro a new beginning. And hope for healing.Jo did an excellent job and I've already read the book twice and plan to read it again, and again!"}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31377959-deborah", "userReview": "Excellent book! I really enjoyed this book, and I look forward to more books by this author. The characters were believable and well-developed. The plot was suspenseful, and I did not know the culprit until the end. Well done!"}], "description": "After two and a half years of deep depression, anger at God, and guilt over the death of her husband and twin girls, all bestselling romance writer Jessica Lynn Morgan wants is to buy a house, get back to writing, and live out her life alone in peace.
