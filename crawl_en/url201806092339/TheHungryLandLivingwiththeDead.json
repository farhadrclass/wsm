This account has it all! Zombies, survival, fights, questioning of morality. I suppose what makes this series stand out is 1) the zombies evolve (so not for hard core zombie traditionalists) 2) the descriptions of the adaptations the survivors have to make to be safe and to eat 3)the personalized feel of all posters (self doubt, disagreements with eachother over structure of the compound, dealing with outsiders, learning to fight) 4) several groups that are well described including the mauraders, and bad guys in later booksThese are just some of the things I really. It is a really immersive story, on occasion you want to rush to the compound/Haven and help them survive the next problem. The characters are just normal people in crazy circumstances, attempting to do the right thing and occasionaly failing miserably. But they persevere, and I keep reading."}, {"userName": "Jo Cochrane", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23915917-jo-cochrane", "userReview": "And the world keeps turning and the zombies are still a problem in fact they are evolving! This story just keeps on getting better! I normally get bored with sequels as most of the time it seems the author gets bored as well but not the case with Joshua Guess, his writing keeps getting better and the story line evolves just like the zombies!This is a refreshing twist on the zombie apocalypse, so if you're a die hard zombie fan you may not be too impressed with the portrayal of intelligent walking dead but for me, who is a lover of fantasy/horror, I found this series a great twist on the now boring genre!"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/961959-michelle", "userReview": "Excited for Book 4 and beyond. I enjoyed this book as much, if not more, than 1 and 2. Being able to hear about the ins and outs of living in this new world is fascinating to me."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/575185-teresa", "userReview": "Finished this third book and I'm liking the series more and more. I did enjoy the first two volumes, which chronicle the struggles and successes of the year immediately following The Fall, as you can almost feel the desperation, hope, hunger, joy, sadness, etc., more and more through Josh's \"posts.\" At this point, though, I'm really looking forward to seeing more of the world outside the compound.Bonus points to the author for his Patrick Rothfuss references, as well as throwing in a shout out to Peter Brett and The Warded Man (one of my faves). Starting volume 4 now..."}, {"userName": "Katherine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18115915-katherine", "userReview": "One year after the zombie plague, the survivors in Kentucky struggle on. They have faced swarms of undead and the war with living. I enjoy the characters in this series are just normal people in crazy circumstances, and are attempting to do the right thing and occasionally they fail. Hearing about the characters adventures and difficult decisions in this new wold. Most problematic thing as this series carry's on, bigger the group the bigger the problems that come from it."}, {"userName": "Lucas Darathy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27597430-lucas-darathy", "userReview": "This was better than the last one. It didn't drag as much, it was more interesting and it was great to see their community coming back from the ashes. It didn't reach the greatness that was the first book, but I think the next one might. We'll see... once again, great series!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca Trotter", "userReviewDate": "Oct 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13741340-rebecca-trotter", "userReview": "I could have told them, way back in the first book, the bigger the group the bigger the problems.Enjoyed it all, even the author's note."}], "description": "One year after the zombie plague ravaged humanity in what would become known as The Fall, the survivors in Kentucky struggle on.
