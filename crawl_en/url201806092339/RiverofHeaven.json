They\u2019re ours forever. We carry them just under our skin, the scars of our living.Ripped from the headlines. Lee Martin came across an article in his wife's hometown newspaper about a man who had made his pooch a doghouse that looked like a sailboat, and wondered what sort of person might do that. That was the beginning. The man he imagines is Sam Brady, 65, closeted, lonely living in the town of Mount Gilead. In the bible, Gilead refers to testimony or witness, so someone is gonna be revealing something. Sam has been carrying a secret inside since 1955. It has to do with the death of his boyhood friend, Dewey Finn. Whatever the surrounding events, it is Sam's journey from secrecy to confession that is at the core of this novel. Turns out Sam is not the only one with a secret in this town. Brady's life is turned upside down with the discovery of a teenage girl in his yard. Maddie is the granddaughter of Sam's next-door neighbor. Arthur is retired Navy and enjoys peppering his speech with nautical references. He is a widower or recent vintage and his loneliness is palpable. He inserts himself into Sam's life, for good or ill. One good is his input into Sam's plan to build a new doghouse for his beloved basset, Stump. A simple doghouse becomes more of an Arc, and the subject of considerable intrest and admiration. So Sam, having kept mostly to himself most of his life now has not only a new buddy in Arthur, an affection for the lost Maddie,I don\u2019t know anything about his granddaughter, only that she was nice to Stump and he seemed to take to her, and. Although it surprised me to find her in my side yard, it wasn\u2019t at all an unsettling surprise; it was, if anything, a little wrinkle I didn\u2019t mind. A little zest, Vera would say. A little shazam to give the blah-blah-blah a kick. strangers stopping by to look at the structure and a reporter from a local paper wanting to write a human interest story about it and about Sam. The reporter is interested in more than the doghouse though, and Sam becomes alarmed that his secret is in danger of being exposed. The world pokes into his life in another way when he sees a report on CNN about a hostage crisis, one in which his older brother, Cal, out of touch for many, many years, is a participant. It is more than merely human company that intrudes on Sam's life. Danger arrives along with his brother.This book was my introduction to the writing of Lee Martin. He was a Pulitzer finalist for his novel The Bright Forever in 2006, so one makes certain presumptions. I found some of those presumptions to be well-founded and some not so much. The best element of the book was the gentle portrayal of Sam and his cohorts. There is nothing flashy here, no neon in the writing. It is all Midwestern understatement, contained, controlled, and effective. I was reminded of the writing of Kent Haruf, who also casts his gaze on the lives of some older sorts being upended by the presence of the young. You will definitely feel for Martin's characters. They are so lovingly portrayed. Martin peppers his tale with bits of quirky charm that add to this warmth. The doghouse, of course, Sam dressing his dog in a silly outfit, a few boys skating by Sam's and engaging in goofy banter. There is a lot here about needing, seeking and finding love in various ways.There is also a layer of danger and violence that mirrors the guilt felt by several of the main characters, entailing content on anti-government militia sorts. I found some elements of this less believable. And there is an execution element that I thought to be just too much. In a high-danger situation, a character interrupts by sleepwalking through. I found this to be not credible, and it disturbed the flow of the story. There were also a few too many coincidences for comfort.There is considerable content in River of Heaven. Can the entirety of our lives be determined by the choices we make as young people? Does confessing our sins help or just make matters worse?River of Heaven is a lovely book, with plenty of well-crafted characters, warm-hearted content, some sorrow, some joy and a bit of fun to recommend it, but the flaws kept it from being a top-notch read for me."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1147841-jackie", "userReview": "I had not read anything by Lee Martin, Pulitzer Prize Finalist for the book The Bright Forever, until this book and now I know what an amazing talent I've been missing.River of Heaven is a bittersweet, moving novel about loneliness, forgiveness and how we touch each others lives without even knowing it. The central character is 65 year old Sam Brady who lives alone with his dog,sometimes going years without someone so much as touching him. Whether this is a self imposed exile or a societal one is up for debate--Sam is a gay man in a very small, rather close minded town. Keeping to himself is the only way to keep his secret, or so he thinks. But that's not the only secret Sam is keeping. His best friend Dewey Finn died a tragic death, ruled suicide at the time, 50 years ago. But Sam, and a handful of others, know differently. And slowly throughout the book we learn more and more of the story even as a newmystery weaves its way into Sam's life via his estranged brother Cal. This book is beautifully written and at times I had to stop and catch my breath because the description of Sam's loneliness pierced me in such a profound way. This is not a sad book, or a happy book--it's both and more. This is a book you'll remember for a very, very, very long time."}, {"userName": "L", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1156396-l", "userReview": "I suppose that if I couldn't put down the book, it has to have 4 stars, at least, no? And this is one I couldn't stop reading, once I'd started. It's got engaging, sympathetic characters. Now, some of these characters could easily slide into stereotypes (the young teenage girl, essentially abandonded and abused, teetering on the edge of \"bad girl,\" but with a heart of gold; the elderly widower who doesn't know quite what to do with himself; the elderly gay man who's been alone since a tragedy in his youth; etc.). On top of the obvious potential for character disaster, these people live in a small town. Not only that, they're all too good to be true. Except, of course, that they aren't, not really. Martin somehow has these sweet characters, but does not allow them to be cloying. To my way of thinking, the book is very well written, in that the writing and the style are almost invisible; they don't dominate the people or the story. Well, and if I can be sucked into a tale about folks in a small town, nice folks, you know there's some good writing going on! I mean, Sam dressed his dog in a sailor suit and I didn't gag when I read about it. So why only 4 stars instead of 5? Well, I didn't really like the ending. I don't mean that it was a bad ending or that it didn't fit or even that it wasn't dramatically necessary. I mean just what I said; I wanted a different ending. (Keep in mind that every time I see \"Titanic,\" I want a different ending.) I can't say more without spoiling it for you and hope I haven't done that already."}, {"userName": "Debby", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1394632-debby", "userReview": "This is a wonderfully written novel about a dark secret held by Sam and Cal Brady for 50 years; a secret that connects them and yet has alienated them for decades. This is a secret Sam Brady cannot bring himself to talk about and yet it has been at the heart of how he has lived his life ever since that evening in 1955 when Sam's 15-year-old best friend Dewey Finn died. Like a beach ball held under water, the truth just can't be held down any longer no matter how hard yu try to keep that \"secret\" buried. I HIGGHLY recommend River of Heaven as a \"must-read\" and Lee Martin as an author to check out!"}, {"userName": "Vonia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5204784-vonia", "userReview": "Lee Martin is quite talented at creating an ambiance. Yes, there is no better word for it. His books create an ambiance that pulls the reader in; but unlike other authors who do the same thing, Martin's words evoke strong emotion. This can be a good thing or a bad thing, since his books seem to lean towards the depressing side. His most lauded work, \"The Bright Forever\", is about the kidnapping and murder of a young girl. As the narrator of the story says, \"This is a story as hard to hear as it is for me to tell.\" That turned out to be as true for this book, \"River of Heaven\". As a reader, I want to be greatly moved by what I read- to tears in celebration, tears in shared pain, the inspiration to change my own life, the charged vigor for revenge on behalf of a character. Thus, I definitely appreciate and an awed by Martin's ability to depress me. on the other hand, I did need to put the book down every once in a while to take myself out of that frame of mind. The focus in this book was on loneliness. I myself am no stranger to the draining, heart wrenching pain that loneliness can cause. I refer to the type of loneliness that is caused by secrets and by ailments that do not an easy cure; things that, even when surrounded by loved ones, are ultimately to be struggled with alone. Here are some examples of his deeply moving words: \"Sometimes, I am learning, that is what it takes- the nearness of people- to make you feel there may be a good reason for all we suffer.\" \"That is what it feels like now- this night, my whole life after Dewey- a sleepy fog. I have always been trying to find the boy I was. I left him back there on the railroad singing with Dewey... One of the last times I truly felt joy.\" \"Now, here we are, each afraid to admit that we have reached the age where our circumstances sweep us, scared to death, into our last years.\" \"Please do not misunderstand. I claim no pardon for my wrong turns, but considering all that has gone on and all that is yet to come, I am content to feel the warmth of this love beginning, to call it the best thing that could have happened next in the story of my life... I will wait, my heart in my throat, scared to death, unable to stop what is coming, ready to give myself over, at last, to whatever bears down on someone- a man like me- from the other side of the darkest truth he can tell.\" The characters are ones we easily begin to love. Samuel Brady, the protagonist and narrator, a gay man who has lived lonely in every definition of the word, afraid to reveal to truth to the world. Who can blame him, when his own father shunned him upon learning the truth? His secret? Decades ago- when a boy he fell in love with who happened to love him back- threatened his ordinary way of life, he panicked and hurt him by calling him names. This led to a few of the other boys in town to rape him. Then, when he tried to redeem himself and allow himself to love Dewey Finn, his pride and fear of what others might think got in the again. When he was about to kiss Dewey for the second time, his brother Cal shows up and he shoves Dewey, trapping him on the railroad tracks. The National Limited train approaches, and Dewey cries out that he is stuck. Cal tells his brother, \"Leave him.\" And Samuel does. The worst thing? The last thing he remembers is Dewey calling out to him, pleading him not to leave him. Samuel is somebody that I can respect. It saddens me greatly how he has had to hide his true self from the world for almost the entirety of his life. I would like to think that this would not happen in real life today, but discrimination and hatred against the LGBT community is unfortunately still quite real and many communities and parts of this country. Like the above quote shows, he takes responsibility for his faults. No, he is not a shiny, exemplary character, but he has what is important. He is a man with integrity.Decades later, Samuel is still living in guilt and fear, guilt of having killed Dewey, fear that someone will find him out. He has been kept company by a long long of basset hounds, his current one named Stump. (I love that his diet is canned duck and potato.) This occupies much of his time, being unemployed. His current endeavor is to build a house. Not an ordinary one, however. A ship. He learns that the ancient builders of ships had have faith comma to put all their heart and soul into it, then set it out to sea with no guarantee that it would ever return to Port. Most importantly, they built ships with which the sailors could easily watch the stars to guide them. The North Star poked a hole through the top of the sky. The Milky Way was a river running from heaven . Arthur Pope, his neighbor, as lonely as well, I recently having to endure the loss of his longtime wife. He is the one who helps Samuel build the ship, as well as introduce him to The Seasoned Chefs, men that meet weekly to learn new cooking techniques. Arthur has his own secret. He was one of the boys who was there when Dewey was raped. He also followed Dewey that day to the train tracks. To do what? It was never quite revealed. Arthur's granddaughter Madeline shows up soon after our story begins. In fact, she makes her first appearance in the ship. She quickly bonds with Samuel and begins to live with him since she is having a difficult time getting along with Arthur at the moment. It is Maddie who opens Samuel's great and shows him that he does indeed have the capacity to love again; that Dewey did not freeze his heart forever. I loved Maddie for her fierceness, and her perseverance despite the pain we know she has had to endure (a mere teenager, her drug addicted mother had left her to freeze in the snow). Yes, she does remind me of me. Samuel's older brother, Cal moved away years ago to escape the Dewey situation, but shows up again now, after being caught in the middle of a terrorist hostage situation. Cal is the one character I felt a little empathy for, his pain, his inability to reconcile with the past, but still did not like him at all. We find out he was actually involved with the plot, albeit in a small way. Is always running away from things. and not responsibility for it. He abandoned his younger brother years ago, after being the one who shamed him into deserting Dewey Finn on the train tracks. He then abandons him two more times, once with his dog (fortunately were eventually reunited), and more time after he kills Zwilling. Why else do I dislike him? He is directly responsible for leading Zwilling, the real time terrorist, to his brothers place and murdering Arthur. Alas, added to the drama is the reporter who comes to write a story on the ship for his local newspaper, Duncan Hines. Yes, that is his real name. (\"So rich. So moist. So very Duncan Hines.\") Dewey Finn is his great uncle. He feels that something was not right about the decades-old opinion that he committed suicide laying on those train tracks. He is only further emboldened by his grandmother's pain. Without any real suspects but a few suspicions, he begins to do a little investigating on his own. Vera Moon is the archetypical outwardly-smiling-perfection-hiding-loneliness-sadness teacher of The Seasoned Chefs. She was the love interest if Cal Brady many years ago before he disappeared without any explanation to her. Since then, she did marry, but her husband is now gone and her children have moved out. She is, beneath her Martha Stewart exterior, someone with a great capacity to love but also needing it in return. After Arthur's death, she is the one who volunteers to adopt Madeline; Sadly, although Samuel would have been the obvious and best one to do this, the truth is that any adoption agency would investigate and reveal his history and preferences. What did I not like? Two main things. One, Cal Brady. We never find out exactly involved he was in the terrorist plot or why he was killed the end. There are hints thar could have been the government keep him quiet; equally possible is that Zwilling's associates found him to avenge death. Secondly, I disliked how Lee Martin dragged out the reveal of the story with Dewey Finn, what really occurred that night; it was referred to time and time again, taunting readers with the mystery, until the last chapter. Literally, once the story revealed, there were only five more pages in the book. Unnecessary for a great writer to do this; a great writer would be able to the reader without use of a cheap \"whodunit\" ploy. And I do believe Lee Martin is a great writer. Thus, unnecessary for him to do this and quite unfortunate. His mastery of words, assembling them into moving passages, have enough power on their own. Looking forward to another Lee Martin experience."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19320424-tracy", "userReview": "This might be the only book I so totally agreed with the \"advance praise\" on the back cover, that I have nothing substantial to add. \"Few writers could unfold Sam's story with the grace and compassion of Lee Martin.\" --Kathryn Harrison. \"Lee Martin has created that rare thing: a literary page-turner.\" -- Dani Shapiro\"Lee Martin's portrait of Sam Brady, a man in fear of his life and crippled by it, lingers painfully and persuasively.\" -- Amy BloomThis is the first Lee Martin book I've read; I now intend to read everything he wrote.

No. Compelling characters who struggle to rise above the dark side of human impulses, fears, acts of injustice and meanness, and tragic mistakes? Yes.If you can face the truth that, no matter how hard we try to make good things happen, sometimes really bad things happen, and we have no choice but to deal with the aftermath of tragedy--you might like this book. Because it's true: Lee Martin explores the tragedy of being human with uncommon grace and compassion that redeem this story. Without the light of his sensibility--that grace exists, that compassion is necessary--this would be a tawdry true confession.

He has lived a life of isolation and loneliness ever since a devastating incident cost the life of a boy he loved, the secret details of which he shares only with his older brother, who has disappeared from his life, only to reappear early on in the novel, bringing yet another devastating secret with him. (Our narrator learns of his brother while watching the news and seeing a hostage situation in Edon, Ohio--about 15 miles from my own home town in northwestern Ohio--with a prior incident in Bryan, Ohio, just 6 miles from my home town, playing a small but critical role as well.) As the story develops, our narrator slowly begins to let a small group of good souls into his life. Small acts of neighborly kindness begin to transform him. He's not quite able to forgive himself, but he can begin to face the future thinking about his potential to touch people with goodness. It is this struggle between cruelty and goodness that is at the heart of this touching story. For those who just want a good mystery, this has not one but two that reveal themselves with well-paced clues.

There is a little mix of family drama, mystery, conspiracy and an unusual love story in the recipe as well. Our narrator is a 65yo bachelor with a host of personal insecurities that are later explained. Despite the age differences, if any, most any can relate to Brady and how we tend to second guess ourselves. Brady's story also exposes how unhealthy living a life totally alone can be. The supporting characters are a big help in moving this story as well. Personally I was unhappy with the outcome of some of the senseless violence but that I'm sure was the author's intent. Nevertheless it's Brady's personal secrets, self-pity, his many regrets and his broken heart that really hit home."}, {"userName": "Maicie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2512140-maicie", "userReview": "I have no idea how to rate this book.

The main thing is, it was told in first person. Now, I admit that I'm already biased because generally speaking, I don't care for first-person narratives, but sometimes it works fine. Sometimes, in fact, a story NEEDS to be told in first person. This one didn't. There were several interesting characters in this story who I would have liked to get to know better, including Sam's brother Cal, his neighbor Arthur and Arthur's teenage granddaughter Maddie. But because everything is told from the point of view of Sam, you just can't. Also, everything is told in present tense, a writing style which I thought was a bit clunky. But what I really found annoying is the fact that you know from the very beginning that Sam has some sort of horrible, deep secret, but he doesn't reveal it until the very end of the book. This would have been okay if the story had unfolded differently and/or the narrative had been told in a different way, but because Sam himself is telling the story, I thought this was kind of cheap -- a way to make sure you keep reading until the end. Now, as to the story itself, I thought it was terrific, and I hope someone makes a movie of it. It was quite unique -- a story about a lonely, middle-aged gay man whose life finds new breath as a result of a friendship with a kooky neighbor and his granddaughter and a whole cast of interesting characters. His relationship with his brother and the terrible secret they share was also compelling, but I thought his brother's story was unnecessarily convoluted.There are some wonderful themes in the book dealing with guilt, friendship, family relationships, etc, and there definitely are some beautiful passages here and there, especially when Sam is reflecting upon his life.

(I won't bore you with a plot summary; you can read that anywhere.)Anyway, oh, sure, the story is a little sappy toward the end. Martin didn't need to express exactly what his main character had learned to the degree that he did. I could've figured that out all by myself. But the rest of the story was so rich with emotion, a plain but captivating style, character, and family conflict that I could barely put the book down. And I loved the way Martin showed the value of \"strangers meeting in the night,\" even if that's not exactly how things happen in the story. Still, all of these elements are marks of a pretty damned good book.An aside: One thing I particularly liked about River of Heaven was its reliance on characters that by any stretch fall into the so-called \"senior citizen\" category. So many books dote on 20- to 40-year-old characters that you'd almost think no one lived beyond those ages, let alone continued to grow or enrich the lives of others. That's a disgraceful and sad bias, and though it's less obvious in novels than in film, clearly it's there. Those who write and those who produce films are still stuck with a fixation on youth.

Also, I noticed that, again, Martin masterfully repeats a single phrase, a refrain if you will, to keep the emotional back story present in the reader's head at all times--in this book, it's two of the main characters who say, \"You asleep?\" to anyone who does something out of the ordinary, a shorthand comment cultivated from their childhood that constantly reminds the reader of their troubled past. I am beginning to believe that Lee Martin is one of the best writers of our time. I would recommend this book and his last--The Bright Forever--to everyone."}, {"userName": "Doreen Fritz", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1456404-doreen-fritz", "userReview": "I like this mystery for its setting: small town in southern Illinois, and for its characters, who are not trite nor one-dimensional, but rather not-all-revealed. The main character, Sam, is 65, a man who has kept to himself all his life and has been estranged from his family since an incident in his teens when his friend Dewey Finn died. That death is the lynchpin for this tale, and explains Sam's whole life. In the course of this novel, Sam begins to rejoin the world through the efforts of his neighbor Abe, newly widowed, and Abe's troubled granddaughter Maddie. And then Sam's long-lost brother Cal comes back into town. . ."}, {"userName": "Ami Stearns", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/638477-ami-stearns", "userReview": "Lee Martin's \"Bright Forever\" is one of my all-time favorite books, and I was so looking forward to reading this one! It fell far short of my expectations. Martin's writing is subtle and evocative, but the plot? Sort of a murder mystery, with homeland terrorism, lots of dead people...I wasn't compelled by it, but pushed through to the end by speed-reading. He used kind of a tired plot: old man finds new life when young, vivacious teenage girl moves in...I rated it as \"ok\" because I like his writing so much. Much of the book felt really forced."}, {"userName": "M.P.

I cared deeply for all his characters, and you see how these people's hard won wisdom have made them through today, for better and for worse. My only quibble are the young people: Martin captures the voices and quirks of the older generation perfectly, but his young characters end up sounding like their grandparents, not feeling or sounding young."}, {"userName": "Sandy D.", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1590672-sandy-d", "userReview": "A rather suspenseful novel about a closeted old gay man living in a small town in Illinois, and what happened to one of his best friends fifty years ago, and what his brother has been up to since they were estranged.It was very good, very spot-on in the descriptions of the town (white squirrels, like Olney, IL!) and townsfolk.

Really awful character development over the course of the book. Maddie was especially poorly drawn, but Cal and Arthur too.The gun play series of events involving Howard Zwilling was so forced and contrived that I nearly gave up on the book then, not caring any more about the Dewey Finn saga. The end was rushed and less meaningful than would be expected.

Whatever, I loved it. Not a topic I've ever read about. And lots of good intertwining w/characters and not how I thought it'd turn out. And I still liked it. It has a strong underyling message too...you are responsible for your actions, and you live with your decisions...and maybe forgiving oneself vs. wanting others forgiveness is what will bring peace.

A story of a boy I knew a long time ago and a brother I loved and then lost.\u201d Past and present collide in Lee Martin\u2019s highly anticipated novel of a man, his brother, and the dark secret that both connects and divides them. Haunting and beautifully wrought, River of Heaven weaves a story of love and loss, confession and redemption, and the mystery buried with a boy named Dewey Finn.On an April evening in 1955, Dewey died on the railroad tracks outside Mt. Gilead, Illinois, and the mystery of his death still confounds the people of this small town. River of Heaven begins some fifty years later and centers on the story of Dewey\u2019s boyhood friend Sam Brady, whose solitary adult life is much formed by what really went on in the days leading up to that evening at the tracks. It\u2019s a story he\u2019d do anything to keep from telling, but when his brother, Cal, returns to Mt. Gilead after decades of self-exile, it threatens to come to the surface.A Pulitzer Prize finalist for The Bright Forever, Lee Martin masterfully conveys, with a voice that is at once distinct and lyrical, one man\u2019s struggle to come to terms with the outcome of his life. Powerful and captivating, River of Heaven is about the high cost of living a lie, the chains that bind us to our past, and the obligations we have to those we love.From the Hardcover edition.", "title": "River of Heaven", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6051705-river-of-heaven", "average": 3.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320509094l/6051705.jpg", "reviews": 83, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4590928.Lee_Martin", "name": "Lee  Martin"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Literary Fiction", "Adult", "Lgbt"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6051705-river-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2720543-river-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2720542-river-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58919.The_Bright_Forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10319935-break-the-skin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/794281.Quakertown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/354773.From_Our_House", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13018893-such-a-life"]}
