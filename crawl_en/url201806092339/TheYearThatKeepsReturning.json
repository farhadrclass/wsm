It's scrupulously balanced and fair, in a context where there is famously little balance on offer. He is - evidently - a good man. Reading this, twenty years from 1991-1995, you also soon realise how little time, really, had elapsed between 1941-1945 and that next flare-up, giving it all a feeling of terrible inevitability (though it needn't have been inevitable, of course).I always avoided the 'ancient hatreds' interpretation (knowing so many people from a generation who patently never felt such), but this does gives more context to some of those fears and paranoias. And you know you've seeing brutal when even the Nazis asked to calm it down a bit. I think it's also safe to say that Tony Robinson and 'Time Team' probably won't ever want to make a special in the former Yugoslavia - stick that 'geo-phys' anywhere and they'll find a missing village from some time in the 20th century with a horrific, fragmented account attached. Yes, the 20th century. The nineties indeed: high-tops, scrunchies, grunge and genocide."}, {"userName": "Wf Munn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10682313-wf-munn", "userReview": "A valuable contribution to understanding the Balkan Holocaust and Nazi collaboration in Croatia."}, {"userName": "Susan Webb", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40965497-susan-webb", "userReview": "This is not an easy read as the unfamiliar places and people's names get confusing.

El autor se centra en sus vivencias personales y lo que ocurri\u00f3 en su \u00e1rea (Karlovac, Kordum, Plitvice) para de ah\u00ed explicar lo que pas\u00f3 en los Balcanes Occidentales. A pesar de recurrir a su propia vida, el libro es bastante objetivo, argumentando siempre sus puntos de vista. Su teor\u00eda principal es que los traumas de 1941 y 1945 no fueron tratados de manera correcta y sana durante la etapa comunista, a esta base se le uni\u00f3 un sistema de gobierno y econom\u00eda destinados al fracaso por sus din\u00e1micas internas y unos l\u00edderes que fomentaron el odio en aras de aumentar sus ganancias personales. El \u00fanico pero que le pongo al libro es que a veces la cantidad de datos y nombres abruman y dificulta la lectura, aunque a la vez es una muestra de lo bien documentado que est\u00e1 el autor."}, {"userName": "Gail Hedlund", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29839688-gail-hedlund", "userReview": "Overall this book was good. I sometimes got lost in facts & figures. Facts & figures are important, but not when the people those facts & figures represent \"get lost\". I thoroughly enjoyed when the author told about his family & friends struggle to survive. People I can see in my mind & the places they lived or were held captive.I also enjoyed how he linked what was going on then with the present day world. I whole-heartedly believe that if we fail to remember the past AND LEARN FROM IT, we are doomed to repeat it. That is probably the single most important thing to learn from horrific events, learn and do not repeat.I'm also thankful that the author had such concise notes in his book. Not all of us were raised learning history of the world around us, which I feel is a big disservice. That's why books such as this are so very important. So that those of us who want to learn and hopefully understand history on our own may."}, {"userName": "Deborah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2724532-deborah", "userReview": "If you have an interest in what happened to Croatia right before, during, and right after WWII, I recommend this book. I would have liked more discussion about the Serbian experience in Lika-Senj County, but I enjoyed the discussion of what the different ethnic groups went through. This book is a good reminder that people can do horrible things, that ideals and power need to be checked, and that--sadly--innocent people often suffer because of others' actions."}, {"userName": "Brian", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1017657-brian", "userReview": "A really nice blend of memoir and history, though the personal storytelling was better done than the context bits."}], "description": "A New York Review Books OriginalThe distinguished Croatian journalist and publisher Slavko Goldstein says, \u201cWriting this book about my family, I have tried not to separate what happened to us from the fates of many other people and of an entire country.\u201d 1941: The Year That Keeps Returning is Goldstein\u2019s astonishing historical memoir of that fateful year\u2014when the Ustasha, the pro-fascist nationalists, were brought to power in Croatia by the Nazi occupiers of Yugoslavia. On April 10, when the German troops marched into Zagreb, the Croatian capital, they were greeted as liberators by the Croats. Three days later, Ante Paveli\u0107, the future leader of the Independent State of Croatia, returned from exile in Italy and Goldstein\u2019s father, the proprietor of a leftist bookstore in Karlovac\u2014a beautiful old city fifty miles from the capital\u2014was arrested along with other local Serbs, communists, and Yugoslav sympathizers. Goldstein was only thirteen years old, and he would never see his father again.  \u00a0 More than fifty years later, Goldstein seeks to piece together the facts of his father\u2019s last days. The moving narrative threads stories of family, friends, and other ordinary people who lived through those dark times together with personal memories and an impressive depth of carefully researched historic details. The other central figure in Goldstein\u2019s heartrending tale is his mother\u2014a strong, resourceful woman who understands how to act decisively in a time of terror in order to keep her family alive.  \u00a0 From 1941 through 1945 some 32,000 Jews, 40,000 Gypsies, and 350,000 Serbs were slaughtered in Croatia. It is a period in history that is often forgotten, purged, or erased from the history books, which makes Goldstein\u2019s vivid, carefully balanced account so important for us today\u2014for the same atrocities returned to Croatia and Bosnia in the 1990s. And yet Goldstein\u2019s story isn\u2019t confined by geographical boundaries as it speaks to the dangers and madness of ethnic hatred all over the world and the urgent need for mutual understanding.", "title": "1941: The Year That Keeps Returning", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17345275-1941", "average": 4.24, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1362466508l/17345275.jpg", "reviews": 8, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5424821.Slavko_Goldstein", "name": "Slavko Goldstein"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/25415.Charles_Simic", "name": "Charles Simic"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6927564.Michael_Gable", "name": "Michael Gable"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6927565.Nikola_Djuretic", "name": "Nikola Djuretic"}], "type": ["History", "Nonfiction", "War", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17345275-1941", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29741082-jasenovac-tragika-mitomanija-istina", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13357840-jasenovac-i-bleiburg-nisu-isto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25636334-tito", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17156520-povijest-grada-zagreba", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18662046-pet-poduzetnika"]}
