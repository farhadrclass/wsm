For some reason the writing came a bit close to the bone. I skipped a few bits but persevered and finished feeling very benevolent towards Mr Courtney. Only to discover that he had recently died. Over the years I have had a very inconsistent attitude towards his books Matthew Flinders Cat is one of my all time favorites and of course there is a special place for The Power of One. Yet Tommo and Hawk and the Potato Factory were just a too difficult for me to get past the first chapter. Now posthumously I read about the man and understand a little more, he is clearly a gentleman and one to be admired. His gift for understanding the human condition was outstanding and his death a huge loss. For me the way he depicts alcoholism, racism and sexual proclivity have always been a source of admiration and I have the utmost respect for his honesty. Not surprisingly it appears he accepted his terminal illness as many of his fictional heroes did with dignity and grace, I take my hat off to such humbleness in one so talented.So thank you Mr Courtney for the memories Jessica will always be the book that bought his more challenging books (for me) and my favorites together in one place.

Seven years later I can remember almost every single thing about this novel, that is how much it stuck with me, the writing was magnificent and elegant, the plot- riveting and tantalising, the characters, enigmatic, engaging and all too powerful for their own good.One of my all time favourite novels, taking me on an incomparable emotional journey that will leave the reader feeling cathartic and de constructed, this is not a novel of happy endings, nor is it a melancholy Dickensian piece or a romantic novel, but one which transcends all realms and can only really be described as a vessel for the reader to be transported into the very vestibules of human nature.It explores the manners in which people will go to any extents to accomplish their goals, even if it means obliterating their supposed loved ones in the process, the reader can almost physically perceive the precariousness in which the most powerful human emotions can blend and bleed within each other, how love can all too often accommodate hate and intolerance, and ambition is all to easily the bedfellow of cruelty and ruthlessness.

It was exhausting to read. I kept waiting for something good to happen but only sadness, cruelty and unfairness were common in the book. There were so many things wrong as well as right. Joe really irked me. He was introduced as this headstrong character whom dominated the household, everybody seemed to respect and fear him in a way. I really took a liking to joe, If not initially a bit of a cold shoulder when he first hit Jessica In the face, giving her a black eye. It took a few pages until it was confirmed that joe wasn't the bad guy in this book. I liked his and Jessica's relationship, I am a fan of breaking the toughest of hearts and I liked seeing joes vulnerable side when he spoke of Jessica appreciatively and stood up for her. A very low moment for me was when joe gave into Hester! I mean honestly we had heard about joe having lived a tough life and he couldn't say no to cold murder when his wife pleaded him and then the submissive he became when he was forced to outcast Jessica. That all seemed a bit low and annoying. Someone With that kind of personality doesn't wear into the cruelty of his own wife. But apparently he does... Or did. I discarded joe after that. For all the good he may have tried after he realised how much of a prick he was he waited a little too late to set his wife in place and died whilst doing so! Which I was glad and sad about because no way joe could get back up on the ranks again. Jack was nearly one of my least favorite character. I LOVE a good romance, but there wasn't ANYTHING romantic about Jessica and jack. He cheated on her with her own sister, married her and then sat around whilst Jessica was in a mental asylum, and wrote letters about his worries. If he loved her a much as he claimed then he would have marched down to the hospital just as he had at the court house and seen Jessica face to face! Tried harder, fought harder to SEE HER, be with her! He makes me too angry to speak about him. I truly wish we had seen more dept to meg it got a bit boring her being described as the walking, talking shadow of her mother. No sister is that cruel or deranged. I wish Hester would have died very early on so we could have seen meg grow into her own person and see how she may have treated Jessica without her EVIL mother breathing down her neck. I am sure there would be a heart deep down somewhere even for a small apology. Character development goes a long way... The only character I truly liked was Jessica's lawyer, he may have been a drunk but he didn't have a bad intention in his body. I wish the had been more of a twist with Jessica's baby's fathers identity and at least one moment of true happiness for Jessica. The constant sadness and tragedy just gets depressive and tiring! I do have to say though the WAY that it was written, the sadness, badness and tragedy was very effective and constructive as this was one of those books that made you BEG for a miracle! Regardless of all the wrongs, this book made you feel SOMETHING and if it makes me feel something then it is already counted to me as a worthwhile good book!"}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "I'm sorry to say that I haven't enjoyed this book as much as I expected. Comparisons are usually worthless, but I can't help but think of Courtenay's former novel, \"The Power of One\" and find that \"Jessica\" lacked originality and spirit. Whereas I loved Peekay and Doc and the way the story flowed, with its easy prose, written almost like a fairy tale, with strong conviction and hope; I wasn't drawn to Jessica or her problems. I thought she was a grown up woman when she has to deal with the sneaky ways of her family (it was hard to believe that a mother could be that evil) and I believe her supposed stubbornness to protect Jack is what mostly brought her to such a desolate destiny. Didn't feel sorry for Jack neither, who finally betrays her without a blink. And then, after all this unearned hardship, she has to earn the reader's respect in the last part of the book, where she fights for the rights of the Aborigines while helping black Mary Sympson to get her children back, although I have to admit that I was shocked by the end of the story and a bit shaken while reading the last pages.All in all, I found the novel a cheap copy of \"The Power of One\", the same topics are discussed: the unfairness of life, strong characters who fight for justice, racism (there's also some Jew characters who play an important role at the end of the novel), human rights and war. All theses issues are discussed in the book, which is fine, but not great if you have had the pleasure of reading his masterpiece before. It has to be really difficult to write something that good and then be able to create something better."}, {"userName": "Debby", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2496826-debby", "userReview": "Humphrey Bower is the primary reason I started listening Bryce Courtenay's books. His narration is so good, that he makes the characters come to life. I finished this book two days ago, and it still haunts me. Poor Jessica, yet she was a selfless character who took care of those in need. Her mother, Hesther...how I loathed that woman! She put the \"W\" in wicked. A mother could really be that heartless, and greedy, and conniving? Apparently so, if one is to believe this story is based on a true story. I can't find out who the real character is, though I tried. I'm not one to write reviews that includes a summary of the story. It's already there, when you read what the book is about. What I will say is that I'm usually not a fan of books with court trials. In this book, I felt the trials weren't long suffering. Jessica gave Billy Simple what little dignity he had left. For the second trial, to read about the plight of the Aborigine children who were taken from their families is heart-breaking. I thought that the trial was well-written, and I found myself smiling at how foolish the government was made to look. The ending is heart-breaking. I was so sad, and yet I was dying to know who the father of Jessica's child was. I wish that Jessica's mom and sister had a demise of sorts, but that was left hanging... I thoroughly enjoyed this story as I did White Thorn. This one, though, left me grieving for Jessica's sad life, and I needed to take a few days off before jumping into my next book. I'm a serial book reader, for sure. Well, an audible book listener, is more what I should say.

It is one of the weakest Bryce Courtenay books I have read. I think Courtenay made his characters too flat and one-dimensional, and in particular his portrayal of Meg and Hester veered into soap opera territory. The final section of the book, which is largely taken up by a court case to do with the Aboriginal Protection Act, seems to have very little to do with the rest of the story. That said, I would have gladly read an entire book on that subject, especially if it were historically accurate (I'm doubtful that any cases ended the way Mary's did in the book).On the whole, I was disappointed in this book. It seemed like Courtenay's central mystery - the origins of Jessica's child - got swept under the rug about halfway through, and only mentioned very briefly as an afterthought, with no space to ponder the consequences of this fact and the repercussions throughout the family's future. It just kind of petered out."}, {"userName": "Charlotte", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17317539-charlotte", "userReview": "The most depressing book I have ever read, I read this many years ago and it still gives me nightmares.

Moreover, I found in this work the character remarkably real, the Australian land she lives in powerfully described and very satisfying. This strong young woman comes to life vividly without the aid of contrived mannerisms Courtenay had used in earlier books for his central characters.Her life is hard and yet she is likable and loving, thoughtful and caring, isolated but not alone. She copes with her fathers\u2019 silent love and her mother and sisters rejection of her existence when she is pronounced guilty of committing an unpardonable sin. Ultimately Jessica is sinned against, in a far more vile way, by her own family as they use her dilemma to their own advantage.Rather than finding the ending tragic, and yes I did weep, I found it uplifting. The plot is triumph over adversity, a beautiful young woman who quietly achieves a great deal in a short time affecting many people while being giving of herself along the way.I have to add, this is one of the few Courtney books I have enjoyed, many others have disappointed me with tragic with endings involving horrible deaths."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6308603-jill", "userReview": "My god, it has been ages since i read this book but I still carry the scars.

She grows up helping her father, Joe and learning the life in the rural area, a very harsh one, encompassed by drought, lack of money and the constant danger of poisonous snakes. That is not the fate of Jessica's sister, though, Meg. She is her mother's preferred child and is spared to be a lady and marry a rich guy. She is also more beautiful and educated than Jessica. She learns the house work rather. For need of money Joe and Jessica get a job at the richest family in the village during the shearing season, and Jessica who is better than a boy at working, happens to work together with the 2 rich boys that Meg has always been after, Jack and Billy. They become good friends silently and Jessica wins their heart with her simplicity and friendship. Without realizing she is also stealing Jack's heart and will cause havoc at home ruining her sister's (and mother's) plan. It is to defend her from the boys that worked in the shearing shed that Billy challenges them to a fight. He is strong, but is caught by surprise and an accident happens with Jack's horse stepping on his head. He will not die, but he will lose his mind for good and will be abused by his own sisters and mother, spoilt brets in the rich house. One day Billy, now called Billy Simple for his condition will take a revenge and kill the mother and the 2 sisters. His escape leads him to Jessica's house. She learns from him what happened and helps him escape the lynch from a mob, delivering him to the magistrate in Naranderra. She almost dies in the attempt and is Jack ahead of the mob that takes care of her for a couple of days. Billy will be sentenced to death but Jessica wins both the admiration and the suspect of having more than a friendship with Billy, especially when she finds to be pregnant some months later. She is banished and a gossip that she is mad is spread by her sister and mom. Meg, meanwhile tries to trap Jack by making love to him and forcing him to marry her, pretending to be pregnant. As Jack is leaving to the war in Europe he does marry Meg but promises his heart to Jessica. Meg tries to fake a miscarridge in front ot the Church old organist unware of a letter from Jack's uncle especifying the conditions of the wedding. They end up having to kill the witness as the plan does not work and Meg goes on with the fake pregnancy. Jessica meanwhile has been banished from the house and will deliver her baby alone. The same day, Joe dies and in the funeral, Jessica's baby is said to be Meg's and due to her aggressive reaction she is sent to a mental institution.Well here the book takes a turn. Di the author not know how to continue and how to close up the drama? Jessica will meet some new people, a jewish who will help her and also contact Billy's case lawyer to help her get part of the benefits that Meg stole through Jack's marriage. Jack died in the war. After 4 years in the mental institution she is freed and goes back to the old home, happens to burn it down and moves to the hat by the creek where she delivered the baby. There what unfolds is a tale of help to the Aboriginal woman Mary Simpson who wants her kids back through some court cases. I found this development very odd. It seemed like the author did not have the inspiration to continue the original story, or...what? It is odd that the author sort of writes the first half of the book in a soap opera fashion, then abandones the style altogether and makes the book become a sort of court case story of Aboriginal (who, by the way was not linked at all with the first half of the book), then closes it with a link to the romantic section: In the last page, Jessica simply dies by a snake bite and we got to know that her son was Jack's. The author spent so much time building Jessica's strong character and she never even went to her mother and sister to get a go at them. The second half of the book departs from the previous. When the fake miscarridge happens, the chapter ends with \"because of this, xxxx will happen for the next 50 years to come\"... but that isn't what the book will tell. It looks like two different books in one.

But this was one of the most depressing books I have ever read. It's so many pages of life just getting worse and worse. The poor protagonist gets beaten down time after time and things keep getting worse, and you hope, \"hey, there must be some redemption eventually, this book's darn long enough.\" But no. Things get worse. Then she dies. It was awful. Now I don't mind sad endings, or challenging reads, dealing with hard material, but this book takes the cake for the relentless abuse of character and reader without any light at the end of the tunnel. I would not recommend this. I hoped that would be the end of it.ALAS, not so long ago, a friend of mine texted me this:\"So I am reading 'Jessica' because you said it might be worth a read.\" I most certainly did not, but that aside, he went on saying \"I need to know, does it have a happy ending? I'm going to quit if it doesn't have a happy ending. *feeling super angry*\" And with those words, it all came flooding back to me. The powerless anger of seeing Jessica mercilessly abused and hoping and hoping things would turn around for her. I know life doesn't always have happy endings, but it is painful to see only the dark side. Needless to say I disabused him of the idea of there ever being a happy ending and that I had ever encouraged a single reader to undertake the dark and fruitless journey that is the reading of Jessica.

This one is about Jessica, a girl who was raised almost as a boy because her father had no sons. She preferred being outdoors to learning the charm school virtues of feminity in the early 1900\u2019s. She grew up to be her father\u2019s right-hand \u201cman\u201d and only with her help was he able to farm and keep enough income to keep the family goin. She was in love with the neighbor boy, Jack, Thomas, the son of the richest sheep station owner in the region, and Jack was in love with her. But her mother and sister planned from early childhood that Jack should marry her sister, Meg, and Meg would be the lady of River Station. Meg and their mother tricked him into marrying Meg by saying Meg was pregnant. Then Meg, who was not pregnant, stole Jessica\u2019s baby when he was born and raised it as hers and Jack\u2019s. Jessica was an outcast from her family and from the community because she dressed like a man, raised animals and farmed like her father, was independent, and, most of all, because her friends and neighbors were the aboriginal people, whom she helped and defended at every possible moment.

Just a really great book."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34988992-lisa", "userReview": "I loved this book. I first read it more than 10 years ago and I still often think about certain parts because it touches on themes I hadn't considered before.
