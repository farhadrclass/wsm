Though I must admit that partly the reason for my reading this novel is Diane Lane. What can I say? Shes really pretty.With that said, I was a little, well... disappointed with this one. I've never read a Spark's novel before but enjoyed the silver screen version of The Notebook so I was expecting something a lil more I suppose. If I could use one word to describe this book it would be juvenile. Paul and Adrienne were a couple of molly-sues and from the very beginning they were superfluously fawning. Too many moments of furtive glances and declarations of admiration. The pages were fraught with Paul and Adrienne thinking how beautiful the other was too the point were it just seemed silly. But I suppose, silliness is one of the many faces of love, most prominent when a third person is observing it.Personally, I prefer love stories with a moderate amount of subtleties. I don't like it when authors spoon feed their readers the personality of their characters. I think it's much better when their personalities manifest themselves through action, through cause and effect and so on. Though there were moments, particularly nearing the end, where I was mildly choked up with emotion, I wouldn't not suggest this to read but I wouldn't say its a must read either."}, {"userName": "Aj the Ravenous Reader", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30248594-aj-the-ravenous-reader", "userReview": "I watched every movie adaptation of Nicholas Sparks' novels but I never cared to actually read his novels which made me feel like I was cheating on this author.

They will put aside their own wants and needs and sometimes personal happiness so that their children's lives go on uninterrupted and relatively normal. Usually the children are unaware of what they have been given. An older mother shares with her grieving daughter a yet untold story to help her daughter move on with her life and to be a good mother to her own children after the loss of her husband and their father.Adrienne shares the story of how as a middle-aged divorcee she meets a man (the only guest - conveniently!) while keeping a seaside inn for her good friend. He is recovering from a divorce and a life lived selfishly and is on his way to make amends with his adult son. They are instantly attracted to one another and a romance begins in the midst of an approaching hurricane. (I just love stormy night stories!)It is a typial Nicholas Sparks story who is terrific at writing a story that women enjoy. It is also typical in that you may need a tissue near the end of the book. All in all a quick read, a good even if predictable story and a good message all wrapped up in the end. Can't wait to see Diane Lane and Richard Gere in the upcoming movie.

Cleaned my bathroom2. Painted my daughter's bedroom BEFORE more paint gets spilled3. Cooked AND ate a romantic dinner with my husband, which would be much better for my marriage anyway4. Gave myself a MUCH needed mani and pedi5. Weeded my garden6. Caught up on laundry7. On and on and on...8. And last, but not least, read ANY OTHER BOOK, I mean, besides another one by Sparks.I have to state, the reason I read this was because I saw the movie preview and I like Richard Gere. The preview didn't seem that bad and the book was getting high marks. Everyone talks about how Sparks is such a great author, but I just don't get it. Yeah, his books are supposed to MOVE you, to make you feel, cry, whatever. But not only are his characters COMPLETELY unrelatable, (i.e. super-perfect humans who have been poorly treated by something for absolutely NO reason whatsoever), but Sparks exploits his readers feelings by using universally tear-jerking situations. Of course you're going to cry if someone you love dies. Of course you're going to cry if your husband/wife cheats on you and leaves you for a better/younger model. Of course you're going to cry if you have a miscarriage/lose a child/anything bad happens to do with your children. It doesn't take special talent to insert your bad situation and then add as much melodrama as possible. I especially like his uber-Christian porn...they looked at each other, they had overwhelming feelings, so much couldn't be said, she led him to the bedroom and they made love. At least if you're going to read romance, a little sex would be nice, describe how these perfect people show their perfect love that has begun in less than 24 hours, and isn't premarital sex wrong, or is that only for the young? Haha! Meh. Sappy, unrealistic and unenjoyable. Like I said, I'm glad that I only wasted 2 hours of my life, because I really can't find anything to appreciate about this book, other than its over.*** I would have given it ZERO stars, but its like having terrible service at a restaurant...if you leave nothing behind, people might think you just forgot.

Everyone is entitled to have a life of their own. She would expect that of her kids (and did) and her father (certainly) expected that of her. What other options did she have?

Mendayu-dayu tapi tidak menye-menye. Romantis namun tidak bombastis. Ceritanya mudah ditebak, walaupun begitu tetap saja saya dibawa ikut dalam irama drama yang naik turun. Hebatnya lagi begitu jelas dan detilnya Nic Sparks menceritakan bagaimana kisah cinta dua manusia di usia yang tak lagi muda, namun tetap sangat menarik. Saya ikut merasakan getar dan gelora asmara yang dialami kedua tokoh utama Nights in Rodanthe. Plus saat mengetahui endingnya, saya tak tahan untuk tidak mengeluarkan air mata.Dibilang happy ending nggak. Dibilang sad ending pun tidak. Yang jelas kemarin saya sangat merasakan ketulusan sebuah cinta sejati, tak lekang oleh waktu. Mau tak mau saya teringat kisah mama dan papa saya sendiri. Mereka bertemu di saat usia papa yang tidak muda lagi, 37 tahun. Tahun 1979 mereka menikah dan tahun 1990 mama saya meninggal. Cukup singkat kebersamaan mereka, tapi sampai saat ini, detik ini, kapanpun papa menceritakan soal mama, beliau menceritakan mama dengan pancaran cinta yang tak pernah berubah. Terkadangpun saat kami duduk bareng, papa masih berbicara seakan-akan mama saya masih ada, \"Min, anakmu sudah besar sekarang. Mia sudah bisa cari uang sendiri lho, lihat saja bukunya semakin numpuk tiap hari\"*kenapa jadi nyesek ya :p*Yah seperti itulah. Dan perasaan 'nyesek' itu yang saya rasa saat membaca buku ini. Sesak sedih, sesak bahagia juga. Mengetahui bahwa orang yang dicinta sudah tenang di alam sana namun cinta dan semangat itu akan tetap ada.

Ceritanya mudah dan ringan untuk diikuti. Kisah ini berpusat pada tokoh Adrianne. Seorang ibu yang terlihat lemah tapi ternyata mempunyai jiwa yang kuat yang orang lain tak sangka. Adrianne mengajarkan anaknya dan kita semua bahwa jatuh dan menangis setelah kehilangan itu adalah normal. Namun, bangun dan kembali melanjutkan hidup membutuhkan perjuangan tersendiri.Hanya butuh sekali kehilangan seseorang untuk membuat kita kehilangan pegangan. Kepercayaan diri dan penghargaan diri menyusut hingga batas paling bawah. Dan hanya beberapa orang yang diberikan kesempatan untuk memulihkan itu semua. Ataupun memberikan kesempatan dirinya untuk hal yang sama. Dan Adrienne pun mendapatkannya. Saya dapat menyimpulkan bahwa ia bertemu dengan orang yang tepat pada saat yang tepat.Mengapa tepat? Karena saat merasa bahwa hidupnya sudah berhenti, akhirnya ia bertemu seseorang yang mengajaknya berjalan kembali. Denganny, ia bisa mencurahkan isi hati, keluh kesah tanpa ragu. Bahkan dengan perkenalan yang baru sesaat. Percaya kepada seseorang tersebut bukan karena dia akan menyelesaikan masalahnya. Namun, cukup bersedia untuk mendengarkan semua hal yang sudah menyesakkan dada. Pertemuan Adrienne dengan seseorang tersebut mengawali kembali kehidupan mereka. Semua terasa sempurna dan tinggal menunggu akhir yang bahagia.Namun, akhir cerita mengatakan lain. Rasa penantian itu harus berakhir pada tangisan kesedihan. Tapi dari cerita sedih inilah kita bisa belajar. Bahwa ternyata masalah yang menimpa diri kita bukanlah masalah terberat yang pernah diturunkan Tuhan ke hambanya.

There were two main characters: A man and a woman. It was my experience that the man was the stronger of the two characters and the woman served as a witness to this person who quickly becomes an inspiration to the reader. I read this book wondering if his character would be consistent or surprise me. I knew that either way I wouldn't be disappointed and I wasn't in the slightest.Another thing about Nicholas Spark's book, Nights in Rodanthe, that sticks out for me is that while primarily a romance, the book's message was not so much linked to romantic love as it was words of encouragement to be the best person you can be.And that is all I can say without spoilery."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7477266-sarah", "userReview": "This book left me feeling conflicted. A few years ago I probably would have loved this book and given it 5 stars. I used to be such a sap for anything (which explained my love of twilight) but now I'm more sensible. I'll start with the positive things about this book. First of all, I liked the books message. Adrienne wanted her daughter to understand that even though she was grieving the loss of her husband, she had responsibilities to look after her children. My dad died when I was 15 and my mother was a lot like Amanda in respect to how she dealt with it. I really felt for Amanda and I was happy that Adrienne's story really got through to her. I also liked Adrienne and I liked how she was conveyed. Everyone thought she was ordinary and it's only after her story that her daughter acknowledged how strong and extraordinary she was. I liked that. The writing also left me feeling conflicted. I can't decide whether Nicholas Sparks is a brilliant writer or a mediocre one. Maybe he is both. The writing in this novel is very descriptive but the book is so short that it shouldn't have needed it, I thought a lot of it was unnecessary waffle. Sparks would sometimes go off explaining something and I got annoyed because I just wanted him to get to the point. He always seems to conjure up a story about two people who are missing something from their lives and then when they meet, their lives magically become complete. I don't believe that someone can make your life complete but I suppose if you're missing a person then it's a little more believable. I think a lot of thought goes into how Spark's characters will meet, fit together (too perfectly for it to be entirely believable), fall in love (too quickly in my opinion) and then either live happily ever after or not (his books seem to go both ways). Saying this though, I'm not sure if that's good. It feels too forced and that gives his stories an insta-love vibe most of the time. There was definitely insta-love in this novel. Like major insta-love. For one they both spent a lot of time describing how beautiful the other one was. We get it, they're perfect. I won't deny the fact they had a connection but again it felt forced. The romantic part of me will ignore that for a minute but I just don't know why Sparks made them love each other like 36 hours into meeting. I think he should have played the strong connection card and then built up the love with the letters and calls but then I suppose they couldn't have \"made love\". Which brings me to the next thing that annoyed me. Adrienne was talking about how people shouldn't have one night stands or sleep with lots of people (nothing like a bit of slut-shaming!) but then like a page later she was bringing him upstairs to bang him, oh no wait sorry - to \"make love\". You can't justify that with the excuse of love when it just doesn't seem like love. I think they were both yearning for companionship and those few days in the Inn made them think that what they had was love. All that said, I enjoyed how it was light and quick. You didn't really need to give this book much thought. I would recommend it to romance readers. This isn't my first Nicholas Sparks book and it probably won't be my last."}, {"userName": "Buggy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3099666-buggy", "userReview": "Opening line: \"Three years earlier, on a warm November morning Adrienne Willis had returned to the Inn and at first glance had thought it unchanged, as if the small inn were impervious to the sun and sand and salted mist.\"Even in a book that's only 222 pages long Nicholas Sparks manages to weave his magic. Building a level of suspense as we await breathless to learn of Paul's fate. Reminisent of The Bridges of Madison County this is a quick, easy read but a great story nontheless. The story begins with Adrienne telling her widowed daughter the tale of her brief love affair fourteen years earlier with a surgeon named Paul. We then alternate between Paul and Adrienne's points of view as we learn the story of their lives and what brought them each to divorce before they found themselves at the inn in Rodanthe. With a violent storm brewing our protagonists share a walk on the beach and two meals together then fall hopelessly in love.

I jumped into this book next because after reading my last phenomenal book choice, I was in the mood to read a little romance but this was a disappointed. No flowery beauty, passion or anything that made me feel a single emotion. I became bored frequently and found myself pushing, which I hate. Everything was so \"blah\". Even the supposed love affair was just \"blah, really, your in love after two days, without a stitch of passion or anything remotely romantical..oh ok whatever, are we finished yet?\" I started skimming, A LOT. I felt also that it was evident that this was written by a man because there were supposed attempts at describing her attraction to him that were just..not what we would think at all.

The book starts in the present day 8 months after Adrienne's daughter's husband has died from cancer and she (the daughter)is struggling after his death. Her grief is so much that at times she has trouble taking care of herself let alone her young children. After months of watching her daughter struggle with moving on, Adrienne makes the decision to tell her daughter something she has not shared with any of her children- her own personal story of love and loss.Thus begins our tale.

I started this book last night at 3 AM when I couldn't sleep, and less than 24 hours later I was finished. I couldn't put it down! The sweet, secret romance that took place between Adrienne and Paul was so romantic. Just about every woman dreams of the whirlwind romance that is portrayed in the novel. That said, I felt this was more like a short-story than a novel. It was over too quickly, and I felt that there could have been more to the romance and more to the overall storyline that would solidify the novel. Additionally, I wanted to know more about the relationship between Jean and Adrienne, and was dying for the \"girl talk\" that I was thinking would normally take place in the setting Adrienne was in.I did, however, like the way the novel was a story within a story as Adrienne shared her past with her daughter, Amanda. It was the perfect setting for the story to play out."}, {"userName": "Shawn McDowell ", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60395876-shawn-mcdowell", "userReview": "It had a touching ending when Paul's son came to see Adrienne telling her how much love Paul with her....that's a shame Paul dying to save his son from a bad accident....I thought it was a very good book and it touched my heart reading this book..."}, {"userName": "Elise Reding", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38440220-elise-reding", "userReview": "One star because I wasn't able to finish.

At forty-five, Adrienne Willis must rethink her entire life when her husband abandons her for a younger woman. Reeling with heartache and in search of a respite, she flees to the small coastal town of Rodanthe, North Carolina to tend to a friend's inn for the weekend. But when a major storm starts moving in, it appears that Adrienne's perfect getaway will be ruined -- until a guest named Paul Flanner arrives. At fifty-four, Paul has just sold his medical practice and come to Rodanthe to escape his own shattered past. Now, with the storm closing in, two wounded people will turn to each other for comfort -- and in one weekend set in motion feelings that will resonate throughout the rest of their lives.Did You Know?---The main characters' names were Christmas presents to Nicholas's in-laws (Paul and Adrienne)?This was Nicholas's first book to debut at #1?", "title": "Nights in Rodanthe", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15926.Nights_in_Rodanthe", "average": 3.83, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328145638l/15926.jpg", "reviews": 4151, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/2345.Nicholas_Sparks", "name": "Nicholas Sparks"}], "type": ["Romance", "Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15926.Nights_in_Rodanthe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4499891-nights-in-rodanthe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2946276-nights-in-rodanthe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9124575-o-sorriso-das-estrelas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1708704.Nights_in_Rodanthe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15931.The_Notebook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3473.A_Walk_to_Remember", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5526.Dear_John", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6400090-the-last-song", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3063499-the-lucky-one", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26813208-thirty-five-and-a-half-conspiracies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489452-thirty-one-and-a-half-regrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198652-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29339972-thirty-six-and-a-half-motives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23263614-thirty-three-and-a-half-shenanigans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40199170-thirty-and-a-half-excuses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments"]}
