How do you keep your readers interested in a murder mystery when the murderer is revealed at the very beginning of the book?1) By making the execution of the murder so devious that it will need the input of \"Detective Galileo\", a modern day, Japanese Sherlock, to reveal it.2) By writing the murderer and the investigators in such a way that you empathize with both sides, and the conflict is lifted from the story and lodged somewhere between your throat and your stomach as well as within the pages of the book.One of the things I'm really coming to appreciate Higashino is that while his stories focus on the technical genius of the murders, he gives equal weight to the emotions behind the murder. And the revelation of those emotions, the driving events, are just as important as the how of it all.I really hope they start to translate his earlier Galileo novels into English."}, {"userName": "Marita", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17415449-marita", "userReview": "\"'This is perfect, actually,\u2019 Utsumi said as he handed her one of the mugs. \u2018What is?\u2019 \u2018This coffee.

Coffee in fact plays a very important part in this story.Right from the outset we know the who (or do we?) and the why. What we don't know is the how. Oh, we know that the victim's coffee was poisoned, but how and when was it done? However, the police haven't read the first chapter of this novel, and with the exception of junior detective Utsumi, the detectives on the case are examining the who, why and how. Utsumi is pretty sure that it is only the how which is missing in order to solve the case. And that is why she tells physics professor Yakawa, nicknamed Detective Galileo, about her theory and persuades him to help them to find what trick was used. His response is: \"With a magic trick, as soon as the show is over, the opportunity for the audience to perceive the secret is gone. However, with a criminal trick, investigators can pore over every detail of the crime scene until they\u2019re satisfied.

Not because it is hard to put into words what the story holds without giving away spoilers. But because a detective novel usually doesn't give a reviewer much to go on, aside from a mystery and its solution.But despite being a book of the same genre, Salvation of a Saint, provides ample food for thought on the complexities of the human mind and offers the reader some philosophical meanderings to go with a regular offering of a mind-boggling mystery.Without delay, let me get to the summary now.Yoshitaka and Ayane Mashiba have been married for one year and yet their marriage is already falling apart. Why? Because turns out, both of them had agreed to treat marriage like a contractual agreement in which if Ayane fails to conceive a child within a year they will part ways. And, of course, Ayane has failed to conceive at the end of the stipulated time period.So what happens next? Yoshitaka declares he is leaving her because he has already found prospective new baby-producer to replace Ayane. And it turns out that she is none other than Ayane's protege, Hiromi Wakayama, whose talent Ayane has helped hone herself.And to put the cap on this madness, Yoshitaka gets killed in his apartment while Ayane is away in Sapporo on a visit to her parents and the detective in charge of the investigation falls for Ayane at first sight even though she becomes the chief suspect.But then of course, she has a rock solid alibi. She was away from Tokyo when Yoshitaka was murdered. How do you kill when you are physically hundreds of miles away from the scene of the crime?Here in lies the novelty of Salvation of a Saint. It's not a whodunit as much as it is a howdunit.To me the real villain of the story remains the victim and not the murderer. Because men who treat women like baby-producing machines and switch to one from another as easily as changing clothes, deserve to be at least squarely kicked in their family jewels, if not murdered outright. And I'm pleased to find out there are no misogynistic undertones in this narrative since Higashino doesn't gloss over this fact.Now for my verdict on Higashino as a writer:-If you are acquainted with anime such as Death Note, Monster or Detective School Q (Tantei Gakuen Kyu), you are bound to know that the Japanese, being big fans of logical reasoning and the science of deduction, have a penchant for creating stories with a worthwhile mystery at its center. And Keigo Higashino upholds that cherished tradition with this well-plotted novel. He excels at creating a mystery which appears convoluted and unsolvable at the outset, but when it unravels slowly and all the pieces of the puzzle start falling into their place, the solution doesn't baffle one as much as the killer's dedication towards the very act of the murder does. But I have a bone to pick with the translation - it doesn't always do a good job of capturing the true cadence of Japanese speech and the awkward sentence construction feels jarring at times.A significant thing about this book is instead of one detective giving it his all to solve a murder, it gives you 3. The detective in charge of the investigation, Kusanagi finds his judgement dangerously clouded by his growing fascination for Ayane. While his assistant Kaoru Utsumi, stubbornly convinced of the fact that Ayane is the killer, seeks out physics professor cum detective extraordinaire, Manabu Yukawa aka Detective Galileo to help her out.But even while pursuing separate leads, all 3 of them arrive at the same answer.The characters are not badly sketched caricatures but appear as people who could actually exist. The calmness of Ayane's demeanour even under suspicion, Utsumi's doggedness, Yukawa's brilliance and Kusanagi's quiet dignity shine through.Kusanagi and Yukawa's friendship, rivalry and the grudging respect they have for each other add another dimension to the story. And it reminds one of the Lestrade and Holmes equation because like Lestrade, Kusanagi is the one getting the credit even though most of the work is done by Yukawa. Although a comparison between Lestrade and Kusanagi won't be fair since the former was essentially a pompous idiot while Kusanagi is balanced and reasonable.It is also interesting to take note of Kusanagi's increasing concern over his own evaluation of the murder and the subsequent investigation - is he being objective or is he being too judgemental? and how does one stop his personal feelings from getting in the way of his professional assessment of a scenario?His inner turmoil leads him to ponder over what makes a person commit a murder and the effect it has on their personality:-\n\"Kusanagi had met plenty of good, admirable people who'd been turned into murderers quite by circumstance. There was something about them he always seemed to sense, an aura that they shared. Somehow, their trangression freed them from the confines of mortal existence, allowing them to perceive the great truths of the universe. At the same time, it meant they had one foot in forbidden territory. They straddled the line between sanity and madness.\"\nLastly, this novel also dares to analyze the not-so-flattering shades of a woman's personality and how one woman is sometimes another woman's worst enemy - how an act of betrayal may cause a woman to seek out vengeance with a resolute, perverse passion. Hence an impressed 3 stars. Highly recommended to lovers of mysteries and it doesn't hurt either if you are a fan of Japanese literature in addition to that.P.S:- I apologize for not shedding any light on how the title of the book relates to the murder or the core of the story. But to do that would be to reveal the crux of the story itself, which would be doing the future reader a grave injustice.Review as in Aura of Sleepless Dreams"}, {"userName": "Nandakishore Varma", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma", "userReview": "Every classic mystery is a magic trick - it works through misdirection. While the magician entices us to watch something in the open, his quicksilver hands does the business out of sight, and we are mystified at the apparent breakdown of the rules of nature. \"The hand is quicker than the eye.\" In the mystery story, it is the same - we are persuaded to chase the red herrings while the writer cleverly builds up his plot under wraps. The only difference is, unlike the magic trick, the novelist tells us how it was done at the end.Keigo Higashimo's \"The Devotion of Suspect X\" was a classic in this aspect. \"Malice\" was also good, though by then I could sense how his particular style of sleight-of-hand was carried out. In \"Salvation of the Saint\", however, the style is slightly different.As with \"Devotion...\", the murderer is pretty clear from the beginning. The focus in a Higashimo novel is not as much on \"whodunnit\" as \"howdunnit\". In this aspect, he resembles the great Dorothy Sayers (for example, the novels \"Strong Poison\", \"Unnatural Death\" etc.) - it is impossible for the most likely person to have committed the murder: yet it was done.When Yoshitaka Washiba is murdered by poison in his coffee, his beautiful wife Ayane is the obvious suspect - especially since Yoshitaka had declared his intention of leaving her and marrying her young apprentice Hiromi Wakayama. The problem is, Ayane is hundred of kilometres away when the murder happens, as per the testimony of Hiromi herself. It is left to Detective Kusanagi to unravel the mystery, all the while fighting the strong attraction Ayane exercises over him. However, he has Professor Yukawa of Tokyo University (\"Detective Galileo\"), who solves cases like problems in physics: constructing hypotheses and testing them.There is no long trail of false clues in this story - the whole thing boils down to how the poison was introduced into the coffee. But while the method is brilliant and there is a logical explanation for all the doubts it gives rise to, I felt slightly disappointed here as I partly guessed where the poison was, and how it was disposed off. As any mystery which is amenable to deduction by the reader disappoints me, I wouldn't rate this as high as his other novels I have read.Still, an extremely enjoyable and well-written mystery, with memorable characters. I am getting to be a fan of Detective Galileo."}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283951-eve", "userReview": "\"Kusanagi had met plenty of good, admirable people who'd been turned into murderers by circumstance.

It takes place in Japan and is a masterful police procedural featuring several police detectives and the ever-fabulous physics professor Yukawa solving what appears initially to be the perfect crime. One of the things I love about Higashino's novels is that they reflect a uniquely Japanese style and temperament. The aggressive/confrontational interrogation tactics typical of American detective novels and movies is nowhere to be found. There's a politeness in every interaction between the detectives and suspects. If there's a little tension, it's between and among the detectives jockeying for position to be the one to solve the crime. Salvation of a Saint presents an unsympathetic murder victim and, initially, a particularly sympathetic potential perpetrator. It's a detective novel for those who like their solutions challenging - the more puzzle-oriented readers - the how, as it were, and also want to be presented with a \"why\" that makes sense based on human nature. Higashino scored on both points in this novel. Finally, his pacing is sublime. I stayed up far later than I should have to read this one night because Higashino has figured out how to drive the reader to read just one more chapter. And one more. And one more. I can't recommend Salvation of a Saint enough, if more complex detective novels are your thing."}, {"userName": "Amit Shetty", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7280101-amit-shetty", "userReview": "There's nothing more scary than the truth that hides in plain sight.\nFirst of all, what makes this this murder mystery an interesting read,1. By the end of the 1st chapter, you will know who committed the murder.2. By the end of the 2nd chapter, you will know what happened to the victim (as we always do).BUT3. It will take close to 300+ pages to find out exactly how the victim was murdered.When one picks up a murder mystery, one might expect an extremely elaborate plan to murder, motives that can sometimes go back decades and if I'm lucky maybe even a weird weapon of choice.With slight modification to one of the above 3 elements, I'd say, the book excels on all 3 grounds. When I finished reading the first 2 chapters in the book and realized that there are more than 300 pages remaining, I knew I was getting into something highly complex. And boy, was I not disappointed. The novels continues on with the detectives going about their regular work, questioning anything that moved. The murder plan was extremely simple, but complex enough to keep the reader guessing till the end. Even crazy, if not mind boggling and the motive was quite obvious from page 5, though the reason was not. Keigo is definitely well on his way (after reading this book, a long way) from becoming the next Arthur Conan Doyle, the reason for which I shall now explain.Keigo has definitely done a great job by concentrating more on the case than on the characters themselves, especially from those in the police department. But as a reader of his previous work, The Devotion of Suspect X, i believe, he hasn't given us a character who can be described as the  Japanese  Sherlock Holmes. Throughout the book, I was confused as to whether Manabu Yukawa or Shumpei Kusanagi were playing the part of the main protagonists, once thing the author should have kept in mind when he reintroduced the characters from his previous work. My above statement is highly evident from the fact that since Yukawa is the one who mainly decodes the case, he is hardly given any spotlight at all. I hope the author improves on this in his next work.Normally, after writing an entire paragraph on what's wrong with this book, I would give a rating in the range of 2-3 stars but the overall simplicity of the murder plot won me over, and thus I'm compelled to give this book a 4 star rating.And under normal circumstances, I would refrain from the idea of turning this novel into a movie since they basically alter the plot line which can seriously piss the reader off. But this case deserves an exception. After watching The Devotion of Suspect X on screen and how closely it follows the plot line. I will admit that I am eagerly looking forward to the movie adaptation of this book.For the Indian ReaderThe mass market paperback version of this book is available at great discounts across many online retailers. But, I would recommend buying the book from \nInfibeam\n, for the simple fact that they don't charge extra delivery fees for shipping anywhere in India, and that their delivery timings are on par with that of FlipKart (Seriously pissed off at them right now)."}, {"userName": "Patrick Sherriff", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26176496-patrick-sherriff", "userReview": "I don't recommend this book if you are trying to cut down on caffeine. I say this as someone who drinks far too much coffee for his own good. I decided to knock coffee on the head for a week. The same week, by chance, I started listening to the audiobook of Salvation of a Saint. On day one, I had terrible headaches and a real craving for the smell and taste of filter coffee. And then I found, much to my chagrin, the victim keels over from a cup of poisoned coffee and all I could think about was coffee. In fact, the the whole novel revolves around coffee, or how the poison got in to the coffee. Every day for a week as I struggled to detoxify my body, I listened to detectives experimenting with coffee filters, debating whether mineral or tap water went into the coffee and who had the last cup? Well, it wan't me.Anyway, when I could drag my mind away from my addiction, I found the book's tastiest elements were the blend of characters -- our hero cop who falls for the femme fatale, his sidekick female junior detective who decidedly doesn't fall for suspect no. 1, and the professor who hovers Spock-like over all the bickering parties offering sage advice to follow the clues to their logical conclusion. At times I found the whodunnit puzzle a little too tedious and our hero's infatuation with the suspect not strongly convincing, but it was all palatable enough. The audiobook narrator was very good, although his pronunciation of Japanese place names was sometimes - how you say? - distracting.

It alters difference in feel, approach, confrontation, reflecting the over culture well. But that exact point of style in particular is also a factor to why many readers of impatience or other faster paced and less repetitious to manners sensibilities would not persevere to the end. Many Westerners will pale at the repeating language. Exact words in plot progression repeated. And repeated.This one held some deep characterizations. Three people in a romance triangle of sorts and technical savvy to HOW the crime was committed is the focus of the entire book. But what is plunged, is plunged to immense degree. From the get-go, as in other Higashino works, you are plucked right into the action of the crime. You know where and to whom. And the entire remaining 280 pages is to figure out why and how. The two main \"sleuthers\" are static in that they are solid for the entire series, but on occasion there is emotive underlayment. Which is particularly hard to detect and to communicate in this modern Japanese placement. There are probably one hundred methods of asking for permission or for proclaiming some form or movement towards expressing \"I'm sorry\"- for instance. But the answer in this one was rather a one trick pony. And the deep malicious nature wasn't revealed in any part until nearly the absolute end. So I thought this one was a good read 3 star for Japanese best seller detective beat. Although most is in Tokyo, this one had some travel to the North and to Hiroshima within the plot. That and the train portions were interesting too.

First we come to know the crime and then the next moment we get to know the criminal but what we won\u2019t know is the reason behind it and these kinds of mysteries is what i love to read. Where rather than concentrating on who is the criminal, the plot is more about why and how it was done. Ayane and Yoshitaka a married couple, don't have children even after trying.

From page 1, the victim, Yoshitaka Mashiba, is a preening narcissist unapologetic about his misogyny. The book opens with his reiteration of his so-called 'life's plan'. The only purpose of marriage is to have children. It's been a year, and his wife Ayane is still not pregnant. Her time is up, he announces, while at the same time chiding her for her unsympathetic attitude toward this setback in this goal. He will be divorcing her. Ayane, on the other hand, is portrayed as the model housewife. She manages everything, including cooking elaborate meals when they entertain guests. Her husband's business associate Tatsuhiko Ikai sums it up:  \u201c 'She was the perfect wife, you know. Utterly dedicated to him whenever he was home, she would sit there on the living room sofa, doing her patchwork, ready to serve if he needed anything. Not that he ever appreciated her. To him, a woman who couldn't bear children was no more useful than a trophy on the wall \u2014 just taking up space.'\u201d (p.135)In addition to being a devoted wife, Ayane is also an acclaimed artistic talent. Her hand-sewn quilts with their vibrant designs and colors have success in gallery exhibitions, and the atelier she heads has many talented students. One of her quilts might easily sell for over a million yen ($9000+)! Yet, she may as well be invisible. Her husband is uninterested in her work. The detectives have never even heard that patch-work quilting is an art form. Even Tatsuhiko for all his sophistication is surprised  \u201cthat something made out of little bits of cloth sewn together could cost so much.\u201d (p.11)The other prominent female character in this book is Kaoru Utsumi. She is a young detective with strong instincts and astute observations. Despite drawing criticism from her superior, Detective Kusanagi, she is outspoken in her suspicions. She is the \u201cnail that sticks out\u201d but instead of being hammered down, their chief, Mamiya, is supportive. After a rebuke by Kusanagi, he interjects:  \u201c 'What's the point having our new detective on the team if she doesn't feel at ease sharing her observations with us, hmm?'\u201d (p.83) Utsumi goes much further than merely voicing her conjectures. She seeks out Manabu Yukawa, physics professor and former classmate of Kusanagi to help find the physical evidence that would support her position. Yukawa has been consulted in numerous police cases in the past \u2014 so much so that his nickname is Detective Galileo. Readers of Higashino's previous novel, THE DEVOTION OF SUSPECT X, will recall Yukawa's prominent role in that book. Here, he has a lesser role and does not even appear until page 102. Yukawa's character is in sharp contrast to the other characters. Whereas Utsumi is eager and enthusiastic, Yukawa is detached. Whereas Kusanagi is uncommonly polite (at least to American readers), Yukawa is brusque and disputatious. He is hardly charismatic, at least in this book. Perhaps this is because we do not see him through the admiring eyes of a Dr. Watson. It may be that these so un-Japanese eccentricities are what make Yukawa so popular with Japanese audiences. Yukawa's contribution to this mystery is not his scientific knowledge but his impeccable dedication to logic: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. The logic leads to two contradictory lines of investigation. There is no evidence of an unknown intruder, perhaps a past lover, who committed the murder. Does that mean there was no intruder? That is the line Kusanagi takes. He pursues this direction with stolid workmanlike devotion. The investigation expands to a widening circle of past connections to the victim. Yukawa adopts the position that even though there is no evidence, that doesn't prove his prime suspect is innocent. This is an unusual mystery. Instead of focusing on who?, it focuses on how? Whereas Yukawa is driven by his own curiosity, Utsumi is driven by the practical consideration that unless she finds proof, a murderer will have eluded justice. Kusanagi is driven by more internal considerations. He too has instincts and he wants to find the evidence that will put to rest his doubts. Yukawa is also attentive to the danger of confirmation bias. When he directs Utsumi to ask a list of questions he refuses to disclose his theory until after she has provided the answers to him.Another unique characteristic of this novel is that because of our dislike of the victim, the perpetrator is shown in a sympathetic light.  \u201cKusangai had met plenty of good, admirable people who'd been turned into murderers by circumstance. There was something about them he always seemed to sense, an aura that they shared. Somehow, their transgression freed them from the confines of a mortal existence, allowing them to perceive the great truths of the universe.\u201d(p.207) It's an odd perspective for a detective.Although the writing keeps the reader at a distance, I liked the insights into Japanese culture glimpsed in this book, as well as the ingenious and disturbing solution. For those reasons, I give it four stars.NOTES: Interview with Alexander O.

I will start off this review telling that, if you haven't read the first one till now, please do yourself a favour and read that. I would put that novel beside The Millennium Trilogy. Higashino hasn't got the nick 'Japanese Stieg Larsson' for free.First a question. How would you keep your readers glued to a crime story where in the first chapter you have declared whodunnit. Simple, read 'Salvation of a Saint' and you will keep the pages turning yourself. The story starts with a conversation of Ayane Mita and Yoshitaka Mashiba, married for around one year by now. Yoshitaka wants a child and while marriage, he laid his plan clear to Ayane, that is, if she can't bear an offspring within an year, they would have to cut the tie. In the very first conversation in the book, Yoshitaka again says this to Ayane and she is left wondering whether her husband really loved her or not. And while they go downstairs to meet their guests of that night, Ayane utters to herself, 'I love you but I will also kill you'.And it happens. Ayane goes to visit her home town, more than thousand miles apart from the upscale city of Tokyo. She gives the house key to her best student and apprentice, Hiromi Wakayama. After Ayane leaves, Hiromi gets a call from Yoshitaka and we get to know that Ayane's husband is also the lover of her student. Together on that night, they drink coffee made by Yoshitaka. Since Ayane, who used to use the kitchen as her castle, has left, next morning Hiromi makes the coffee while Yoshitaka observes the rules of ideal coffee making. Next day, she gets another call from her lover and they agree to have dinner from a restaurant. She goes to Yoshitaka's residence when her call goes unanswered and she finds Yoshitaka dead, coffee spilled in the floor.The charge of the investigation comes to Tokyo metropolitan police and soon detective Kusangi enters the house. This time, he has another assistant along with Kishitani, detective Utsumi, a rookie young woman. They have two suspects - Hiromi and Ayane. While Hiromi was taking classes throughout the day, Ayane is not even in the scene. So who did the murder, if it is indeed one. The detectives soon find out that Yoshitaka died of arsenous acid laced coffee and so they are now formally into a homicide investigation. The question is looming on them. Who poisoned Yoshitaka Mashiba - CEO of a well-off company and where did the poison come from. They can't find traces of any kind of arsenic in the house. Soon, the investigation has no clue and both the suspects have an ironclad alibi.Ayane Mita comes to Tokyo next day and on first sight, Kusangi is smitten of her. Kusangi with all the experience of his illustrious detective career, can't extract the information from Ayane, while Utsumi has fixed her sight on Ayane as the prime suspect. The two detectives develop a difference between them but none of them can move the investigation one inch and they have to turn to the brilliant Physics professor of Imperial university, Manabu Yukawa - Kusangi's classmate from college, who is long known in the police circle as detective Galileo. But even Yukawa's extraordinary mind finds this coffee soaked murder mystery so beautifully plotted that it appears like a perfect crime. A crime where the criminal didn't intend to kill the target but kept it alive, until at the final point, the string is snapped. And it snaps so mysteriously that it forms a perfect circle, with no hole in it. But if this is a murder, someone is the murderer and who is that.Higashino's earlier novel sported the clash of two genius scientists, one mathematician and one physicist. The outcome, Devotion of Suspect X, was touted as stunning, intricate and beguiling. This one, doesn't have the delicate maths and physics riddles of the former but it has a character development unlike no other crime story, where the central detective finds himself hopelessly attracted to the number one suspect, the other detective tries her wit's end to find any clue and Manabu Yukawa hangs his head down at the perfect crime. With countless side-plots, this is one hell of a ride, where the crime floats on the water, where the crime is deep into the filtration system of the kitchen and is inseparable from the coffee and as neatly woven as the wonderful tapestry made by Ayane.If you like crime thrillers, you will be hooked to this beguilingly complex piece of a mystery to no end. It is one of the rare showcase of talent, enigma, reason and emotion, churned into salvation of the murderer, the detectives and of course, you, the reader."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3170050-maria", "userReview": "Keigo Higashino, who teased readers worldwide with his novel THE DEVOTION OF SUSPECT X about a year ago is back again with a new novel to tease again, intrigue again and keep readers turning the pages until the very end. The author known as 'the Japanese Stieg Larsson' has a reputation to maintain and he's certainly doing a good job of maintaining it.True, it was an English playwright, Congreve, who said that hell hath no fury like a woman scorned. But this is a universal phenomenon. When the person you love stops loving you, it's a betrayal of all you've shared. When that person is about to leave you for a friend of yours and tries to twist things round to make it look like it's your fault, the betrayal can be absolute and unforgiveable. Ayane's husband Yoshitaka had told her that without children, their life together could not go on. For Ayane, grieving inwardly for her failure to bear a child, the fact that her partner turns away from her rather than standing by her in that dark moment makes a terrible retribution inevitable. Yoshitaka is found dead and Ayane is far from the scene. Who poisoned this man?Who knows the truth about this apparently happy couple and their life together? Their friends Yukiko and Tatsuhiko who had recently produced their first child and had received a beautiful, handmade gift from Ayane, a talented crafter? Hiromi, Ayane's assistant and Yoshitaka's secret lover? Yoshitaka, the victim, elicits no sympathy, the arrogant male who was so ready to cast off his hapless wife for a newer , younger model, as one would trade in a car. As a woman, it made me furious. Why is it that in every society in the world women seem to have a 'use before' date? Ayane, the woman betrayed, seems so vulnerable. But is Ayane really what she seems to be on the surface? The answers, which must be unraveled by Detective Kusanagi, may not be be as simple and straightforward as originally envisaged.We meet an assortment of complex characters. What sort of man can be so unselfish that he turns away from a loving wife because she has failed to bear a child? What sort of woman can betray no emotion as the emotional blows are dealt out and treat revenge as a dish eaten cold? What sort of girl can cold bloodedly steal the husband of a woman who has befriended her? Detective Kusanagi has his work cut out for him. Detective Kusanagi's assistant, a female detective, is a delightful character, providing feminine insight into the whole sorry business, a crime involving two women. I do hope what I'm hearing is the author's original voice. Translated works may be technically perfect but they sometimes lose their fresh originality. I very much enjoyed the light touches of humour in the dialogue.This is the second novel I've read by Keigo Higashino and I can honestly say that along with a talent for telling a story with layers and twists aplenty, he gives a fascinating glimpse into Japanese society, often considered complex and inscrutable by outsiders. A society where people are struggling to find some happiness and some meaning other than going about the daily grind. Would a child have given meaning and joy to the marriage of Yoshitaka and Ayane? Who can know that? Once I pick up a book by this author, I cannot leave it down. I generally like to wait until I have at least two or three free hours, which has been impossible lately owing to problems with work and family. Yet once I picked this up I couldn't leave it. This book has the same fascination as THE DEVOTION OF SUSPECT X. The same adrenaline rush as the book hurtles towards its inevitable - yet unexpected - conclusion. The word 'compulsive' springs to mind.As in the case of the previous book, I found the cluster of Japanese names a little less than easy to get my head around and repeat to the publishers that a character list at the opening of the book would be great, if they could arrange it for future editions. .Yet in the end one can only say that east or west, Europe or Asia, society to society, ordinary men and women deal with the problems of life as they see fit, depending on their circumstances and cultural backgrounds. The local can very much be the universal, depending on which way we view circumstances.Do I recommend this book? Yes, I do."}, {"userName": "Tarinee Prasad", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44191110-tarinee-prasad", "userReview": "The solution was \" \u221a(\u22121)\" . theoretically possible yet practically imaginary interesting yet far-fetched"}, {"userName": "Bill Khaemba", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41380936-bill-khaemba", "userReview": "Sadly, my expectations were not met...

Saya terpesona dengan kasus, pelaku, dan pemecahan yang super rapi dan alibi susah dipecahkan. Saya terenyuh dan kaget melihat Kusanagi jatuh cinta pada sang suspect. Meski begitu, dalam perjalanannya menangani kasus ini, ternyata Kusanagi masih berakal sehat dan cinta tidak membutakan akal sehatnya. Dia memiliki insting yang kuat sebagai detektif. Jadi, dia detektif yang bisa diandalkan.Kasus pembunuhan yang disamarkan menjadi bunuh diri ini begitu rumit, halus dan sempurna. Lama-lama, diperkenalkan tokoh lain yang membuat alasan dibalik pembunuhan ini menjadi jelas. Motif pembunuhannya membuat saya sebagai wanita tersentuh. Jadi, si korban menikah untuk menghasilkan anak, dan memandang wanita sebagai baby machine. Kalau tidak bisa memberinya anak, ditinggalkan. Pelaku menunggu setahun untuk membunuh korban. Selama setahun itu, pelaku mencegah siapa pun dekat-dekat dengan alat pembunuhannya. Dia begitu sabar, cermat dan tekun (kok jadi kaya deskripsi sekolahan gini XD). Intinya, buku ini wow.

Set in modern Tokyo, \u201cSalvation of Saint\u201d is Keigo Higashino\u2019s 1st book I came across. Tokyo Police Detective Kusanagi is the lead protagonist of this crime fiction and has the task of figuring out the killer of Yoshitaka Mashiba along with his team members Utsumi, Mamiya, Kishitani and detective Galileo Prof. Yukawa. The story starts with the couple Yoshitaka and Ayane contronting the truth that their marriage is in shambles within a year and by the time you flip through 30 pages you find Yoshitaka dead. The suspects initially turn out to be Hiromi Wakayama , Yoshitaka\u2019s mistress and Ayane\u2019s favorite apprentice and Ayane the sad shaken wife who was off to her parents when the husband was killed. Even though at that point the readers conveniently know who the killer is, the police force are in the dark and still have a lot of pieces of the puzzle to figure out. Kusanagi smitten by the saint is torn between reality, evidence, duty, mind and heart. It is interesting to go through the dilemma Yukawa goes through to finally unveil the face of the killer. There are times in the book where the interrogation takes a wrong turn and something inside you is dying to scream at the Tokyo police \u201cYou are looking at this all wrong\u201d.The book is a sure quick read and is gripping too cause till the very end the killer is enjoying her time of extended salvation. But unfortunately for lovers of thrillers and crime fiction, who have scanned through Ian Rankin\u2019s Inspector Rebus novels like life and death crisis and remember almost every episode of \u2018Castle\u2019 knowing the killer right in the start is a big loophole that puts you in a realization mode half way through the story and you already know how the story might end.Pros:It is definite page turner with use of very simple narrative and would appeal even the \u201cnot regular\u201d readers.Gripping as far as the investigation is concerned.Character build up through the story, though not intended is good and you can connect to the characters well.Cons:Biggest con would be, knowing who the killer is right at the establishment of the story.Half way through the book the you have an 80-20 chance of figuring out the end.Police getting smitten by a grieving widow was kind of a bollywood-ish plot to me.Over all I would give the book a 3 or 3.5 but not a 4 on five because I really enjoyed the whole hill ride of the investigation. I still wish the author would have waited till the very end to let us know the saint was the satan, because revealing the murderer in the commencement of the book seemed unnecessary. But for people who love crime fiction this book is at least a \u201cgive it a try book\u201d. And people who want to start reading crime fiction this would be a good start because it is simple fast and engrossing at the same time.Originally posted on my blog: http://vaisakhimishra.blogspot.in/201..."}, {"userName": "Libros Prestados", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36773851-libros-prestados", "userReview": "El maldito de Keigo Higashino lo ha vuelto a hacer, la resoluci\u00f3n ha vuelto a sorprenderme.

No es como CSI. Aqu\u00ed, m\u00e1s que t\u00e9cnicas forenses modernas, lo que importa es utilizar el razonamiento cient\u00edfico para dilucidar el c\u00f3mo. M\u00e1s incluso que el porqu\u00e9.

Sabes qui\u00e9n es, lo que no sabes es c\u00f3mo narices lo hizo. En este caso, a diferencia de \"La devoci\u00f3n del sospechoso X\" (la primera obra de Higashino publicada en Espa\u00f1a), la tensi\u00f3n dram\u00e1tica, la parte emocional de la historia, se basa en las visiones opuestas que tienen los policias Kaoru Utsumi(mujer) y Kusanagi(hombre) sobre el caso y la sospechosa. Est\u00e1 en sus dudas y en sus tira y afloja, m\u00e1s que en c\u00f3mo afecta el caso a los distintos sospechosos. Lo cual hace que \"La salvaci\u00f3n de una santa\" me guste menos. Porque la investigaci\u00f3n policial sigue una l\u00f3gica milim\u00e9trica, pero el conflicto interno de los sospechosos es menos interesante.

How challenging can a mystery be if the primary actors are revealed right away? Where\u2019s the mystery? Salvation of a Saint was written by Keigo Higashino, so the mystery lies in how, and why, whether the murderer will be caught, and\u2014most importantly\u2014whether you want them to be caught. As in every other Higashino mystery I\u2019ve read, justice is a tricky business.The murder itself is a seemingly perfect crime: a man has been poisoned, but no one can figure out how. His wife was hundreds of miles away when it happened. His girlfriend and his closest business associate have good alibies. The police can\u2019t find any trace of the poison in the entire house. So, then, what can possibly have happened\u2014and will the police be able to name a suspect? Without a suspect and a clear motive, the case cannot go to trial, so what can the police do?Even with the hints and tiny details provided by the murderer, I still wasn\u2019t sure whether Detectives Kusanagi and Utsumi would be able to sort it all out. This helped ease my mild surprise and disappointment with the revelations of the killer\u2019s identity and motive. I expected to be shocked, and instead only felt vague interest. The method by which the crime was committed, though, was so ingenious that I was truly impressed. And of course, the assistance of Doctor Yukawa was very welcome\u2014more human and fallible than a mere Sherlock Holmes clone, his insistence upon pure science, coupled with his genuine emotional involvement and intellectual curiosity are part of what makes the Detective Gallileo books so appealing to me.Interested readers would do well to read The Devotion of Suspect X before Salvation of a Saint, if at all possible. The choices made by both Detective Kusanagi and Doctor Yukawa in that book have a real impact upon their behavior in this one, though readers who come to Salvation of a Saint first will not feel completely alienated. This book would also work well as an introduction to Higashino\u2019s style and method for readers who are looking for a new mystery novelist."}, {"userName": "Todos Mis Libros", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34145868-todos-mis-libros", "userReview": "Hace mucho tiempo, creo que antes de tener el blog, le\u00ed La devoci\u00f3n del sospechoso X, del mismo autor. Un libro que me cautiv\u00f3 por completo y que no he dejado de recomendar desde entonces. Por eso, al enterarme de que hab\u00eda otro t\u00edtulo del autor publicado en castellano no dud\u00e9 en hacerme con \u00e9l y repetir experiencia. La lectura ha sido satisfactoria, ya que estamos ante un puzzle muy complejo y dif\u00edcil de resolver, pese a saber, desde la primera p\u00e1gina, qui\u00e9n es el asesino, al igual que suced\u00eda con La devoci\u00f3n del sospechoso X, pero esto no hace que decaiga la intriga ni el inter\u00e9s en ning\u00fan momento, ya que nos parece tan imposible que, qui\u00e9n nosotros creemos que es el culpable, haya podido cometer el crimen, que ya no sabemos qu\u00e9 pensar ni por d\u00f3nde nos va a salir el autor para darle resoluci\u00f3n al caso.En cuanto a este aspecto, digamos que la resoluci\u00f3n es un poco rockambolesca, viable s\u00ed, pero bastante improbable de llevar a cabo.

Cuando digo poca gracia me refiero a que todo es pulcro y correcto pero te deja la sensaci\u00f3n de que todo es un poco distante.

This is the second \"Detective Galileo\" mystery I have read and, as much as I liked the first one (The Devotion of Suspect X: A Detective Galileo Novel), I think this one is much better.Yoshitaka Mashiba is a selfish, heartless, and callous man who is obsessed with having a child. When his wife Ayane is unable to have one after barely a year of marriage, he decides their marriage is over - and he already has a replacement waiting. Not surprisingly, he is dead by page 19. I must admit, he's one of the least likable victims I've come across in quite a while. The question for me wasn't so much who killed him or how, but why did anybody care?The initial investigation is handled by Detective Kusanagi and his assistant, Kaoru Utsumi. Kusanagi quickly develops a crush on Ayane and believes she's innocent. On the other hand, Utsumi believes Ayane is guilty. Neither of them can prove it, though. In fact, though it is established early on that Yoshitaka was poisoned, the exact method remains a mystery. Utsumu finally seeks out the help of Professor Manabu Yukawa, better known as \"Detective Galileo.\" The truth behind Yoshitaka's death and just what exactly happened is revealed slowly, but everything comes to a satisfying conclusion. This is the second Higashino mystery I've read, and he once again managed to completely surprise me. Ayane is a complex character and you're never really sure what's going on in her mind. Is she guilty? If she did kill her husband, how did she poison him? The truth really is unexpected. I would have never thought of that.
