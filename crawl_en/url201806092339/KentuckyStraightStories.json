They chew tobacco, drink corn liquor, fight, fornicate, live and die in shacks without indoor plumbing.One man remembers his moonshiner grandpa's words as he tends his own marijuana crop. Another learns the truth behind an ill fated hunt for a killer bear. Still another is ridiculed for his desire to earn his GED. The writing is simple and beautiful. I'm in love with this paragraph from the beginning of House Raising:Rain chewed fresh gullies in the ridge road, turing the hard clay dirt to a yellow paste. The ditch overflowed and gray air blurred the low horizon. Dripping leaves hung limp and heavy.Some sentences evoke poignant memories of an American boyhood:His mother ironed patches on the knees that stiffened his pants like stovepipes.She caught me and hugged me tight again, and I did my best to look down her shirt until finally I just gave it up. I just went and gave up everything and started crying.And finally, this bit of sad and lovely wisdom by an elderly man at the end of his life:Time piles up like brush. You burn it in the fall and all you remember are the glowing cinders. I got ash heaps everywhere I look.The stories are haunting, heartbreaking, and magical.

Offutt's characters speak in clipped sentences that carry more meaning than the long, bloated paragraph busting interchanges too often used by lesser authors. We get a deep sense of place, a different purpose of life where commerce and materialism exist not. It is easy to get lost in these hills and feel like the stories could easily become a work of fantasy told on another planet with bipedal creatures that look and talk somewhat like us, but are not us.Highest recommendation.

Dentro a questo paesaggio incontriamo comunit\u00e0 minime, fatte di poche centinaia di abitanti; vivono in localit\u00e0 sperdute che le carte geografiche faticano a segnalare, a ridosso del Monti Appalachi (le \u201ccreste\u201d): colline e boschi, sentieri e strade sterrate, luoghi popolati da animali selvaggi (il coyote, l\u2019orso, l\u2019alce) e da uomini altrettanto selvatici, segnati dall\u2019asprezza della terra e dall\u2019isolamento. Il Kentucky orientale \u00e8 davvero marginale nella storia degli Stati Uniti e i suoi valori sono arcaici (l\u2019indipendenza, la libert\u00e0, la terra...), i suoi impulsi elementari e violenti. Tutti i personaggi risentono di questo humus fondamentale e comunque rappresentano emozioni, aspirazioni e istinti umani. A volte sono insopportabili: si tratta di uomini violenti o semplicemente arrabbiati. Comprensibili solo dentro il contesto di questa terra di nessuno, dura e aspra. Ci sono anche le donne, forti e determinate, ma anche circondate da un aura di mistero che le rende personaggi appartenenti a una mitologia arcaica universale.Ma le voci pi\u00f9 interessanti sono quelle dei bambini (in Segatura e Blue Lick): voci che offrono un punto di vista straniante e dunque sorprendente.Insomma, come scrive Max Strand nell\u2019epigrafe a questo libro: \u201c questo \u00e8 lo specchio in cui dorme il dolore, questo \u00e8 il paese dove non viene nessuno\u201d.E non a caso nel racconto finale il protagonista (probabilmente come ha fatto Offutt) decide di andarsene verso ovest \u201ccercando di immaginarsi come sarebbe stato vivere in un mondo senza colline.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7555122-laura", "userReview": "I\u2019m not a short story fan but these rock.

The ditch overflowed and gray air blurred the low horizon. Dripping leaves hung limp and heavy.\"It'll pass,\" Mercer said.Set in the rural backwoods of eastern Kentucky, the stories in Chris Offutt's debut collection all explore the lives of inhabitants of a nameless community which is too small to be called a town, and does not appear on any map. This is the sparsely populated and remote region of Appalachia, where people live in isolation from the outside world and where men in extended clans held violent feuds against each other for decades, where pursuing education is taken for a sin of arrogance and belief in the truth of superstition is ever-present. This is the country which nobody visits, and few ever leave. Kentucky Straight contains nine stories of people who can't imagine how a world would look without hills. The opener, Sawdust, immediately catapults the reader out of his comfortable armchair straight into the hill country, where not a single soul has finished high school. When the protagonist wants to take a free GED he is mocked and ridiculed but remains resilient, and the outcome is different from what one would expect. The paragraph quoted in this review comes from the second story titled House Raising, and serves as an opening to a simple but effective tale of a tragic event in a hard country flooded with constant pouring rain, with roads not good for taking things in, but only for taking coal out. The collection won Offut a James Michener Grant and a Kentucky Arts Council Award.Interestingly enough, Offut himself came under fire from an unlikely cannon - his fellow native Kentuckians. The reviews of his second memoir, No Heroes: A Memoir of Coming Home - and you might ask yourself what person writes not one but two memoirs by his early 40's? - were particularly damning, accusing him of pandering to his audience by exploiting stereotypes associated with Appalachia and its people, even going so far as to say that the country he describes no longer exists. So, the collection will best be recommended for those who want to read stories set in a foreign region and not delve to deep into it. Kentucky Straight is best taken with a grain of salt and a fair shake - and to experience fiction written by someone who was born in a holler and knows it inside out I'd recommend works by Donald Ray Pollock, who has written an excellent collection called Knockemstiff and a fabulous novel The Devil All the Time."}, {"userName": "Simone Subliminalpop", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6451667-simone-subliminalpop", "userReview": "\"Da queste parti ti giudicano da come ti comporti, non da quanto ti credono intelligente.\"Non c'\u00e8 spazio per inutili fronzoli e ricercati orpelli nei racconti di Offutt, perch\u00e9 non ce n'\u00e8 nelle vite dalle quali nascono.Segatura \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Tirar su case \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Quello che devi lasciare \u2605\u2605Coda di cavallo \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Luna calante \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Affumicatoio \u2605\u2605\u2605Blue Lick \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605Zia Lith, l'ultima levatrice \u2605\u2605Palla 9 \u2605\u2605\u2605"}, {"userName": "Maria ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15500553-maria", "userReview": "Resistere \u00e8 un po\u2019 il leitmotiv che percorre tutti i racconti: l\u2019unico scopo \u00e8 assecondare il ritmo delle stagioni (attendere alla primavera, sopravvivere all\u2019inverno), un ciclo sul quale si poggiano le vite degli uomini, che trascorrono tra bevute (soprattutto di kentucky straights (1)), bravate e morti accidentali, e quelle delle donne, che se la cavano peggio perch\u00e9 destinate a consumarsi lentamente.

Offutt uses a lot of sophisticated techniques to up the ante on these stories, to keep them from becoming just portraits of Kentucky hillbillies. In \u201cNine-Ball\u201d I like the way the expected fight doesn\u2019t happen, like the way the cue ball is used to inflict the damage. He really uses imagery and the sensory detail well, captures how the pool cue feels, for instance. And using the pool battle as a way to get to the deeper conflict on the periphery was effective. \u201cHouse Raising\u201d is incredibly visual, all the details seem perfect, as if you are watching it on film. But there is also energy in the character conflicts, as when the dozer driver gets his in the end. The subtle hints at racism are done beautifully, it is the real point of the story, but not the focus. \u201cHorseweed\u201d is a sneaky one. Technically it\u2019s quite complex, a generational story hiding in a present circumstance. It also contrasts two lives, and two choices, but you don\u2019t realize that until the last paragraph. In fact the story is filled with subtle choices, just under the surface, masked ever so slightly by the stark realism. What makes this story so great is that for all its technical brilliance, it comes off so smooth, reads like such a simple straightforward story. It isn\u2019t.

What is different is Offutt's particular style of prose, which is pure, pared-down, Hillbilly deliciousness. This guy has the patois of rural Kentucky down pat, using a minimalist, vernacular style to push his narratives forward:The funny-talked lady hugged me right then, just reached out and yanked me to her new-smelling flannel shirt and held me against her body. I tried to squirm away but it didn't do any good. She started in crying and that seemed like a good time to to try and get a look down her shirtfront. After a while she said there was hope for me, she could save me. I told her I didn't want to be saved. Granny got saved four times, the last after Daddy went back to LaGrange. Getting saved meant smiling at all the people who didn't like you, and they smiled back like they did.Or,Time piles up like brush.

I found \"House Raising\" to be Offutt's finest writing, a deep tone and dark atmosphere maintained throughout that was nothing short of masterful. \"Nine Ball\" was a little too much on billiard balls, but it also got down and dirty. At other times, I found these stories similar to Ron Rash's formula----grabbing subject matter that will appeal to outsiders who want to read about an exotic Appalachia more than understand it. He takes us down yet more roads of Melungeons, marijuana patches, and medicine men. \"The Leaving One\" particularly sank as hopelessly hokey, reminding me of Gloria Naylor's Mama Day, superficial cheese.

It may be the attraction of this old race of stubborn and proud people, a certain liking for stories around losers, the way they speak English or whatnot. But I like them. Offutt writes a handful of stories or varying interest,but as a whole the book presents an interesting picture of a world which seems to be disappearing, with characters which mostly have no interest in changing their lives. There's a mix of magic and a kind of terrible destiny. In fact, there's quite a lot of magic, which I was not expecting and I liked. There's a clear relationship with this hilly lands which shape the people. And a lot of poverty, of struggle, of humans living in difficult conditions.
