Her ghost now returns to write this review and haunt Sara until the second instalment is out.Sometimes you see a book, drool over the cover  read the premise and know, in your blood and your bones, that you are going to love it. That you'll lose yourself in its pages, see what the characters see and feel what they feel, and that you won't rest until you savor the last sentence. That's the case with Bring Me Their Hearts.\n\n\u201cI simply want your heart, my prince.\u201d\n\nZera is a Heartless.The second Heartless to witch Nightsinger, a servant and a soldier meant to obey her master's commands while her heart remains locked in a magical jar. She is overcome with an insatiable hunger for blood, flesh, warm organs and pain, a hunger that whispers of her terrible deeds and beckons her to give in to the darkness. Every day, she begs Nightsinger to give her back her heart. And Nightsinger finally relents, on one condition; Zera must infiltrate the court of the kingdom of Cavanos as a potential bride to Crown Prince Lucien d'Malvane and steal his heart. Literally. There is a war brewing between the worshippers of the Old God and the New, and the witches believe that Lucien is the key to avoid it. With a fallen noble as her guide, Zera learns the ways of nobility and finds herself among backstabbings, feuds and hidden agendas. Between trying to stay inconspicuous and seduce the prince in order to achieve her purposes, Zera discovers a connection with the humanity she thought was lost, and comes to care about people that should only be means to an end. But the dangerous game she plays can only have one outcome: either Lucien loses his heart, or she does. \n\n\u201cI am no flower to be ravaged at your whim, angry wolf - I am your hunter, bow cocked and ready. I am a Heartless, one of the creatures your people fled from in terror thirty years ago.If you were smart, you'd start running, too.\u201d\n\nBring Me Their Hearts is a luscious tale of court intrigue, magic and bloodshed, with a dash of sass and a sprinkle of darkness. It's one of those rare stories where the gallant prince does not save the damsel from the monster. In fact, the damsel is the monster, with claws and sharp teeth and murder in her hands, and a gnawing, relentless hunger to feast on blood. But the girl within keeps fighting the monster, with small and big acts of defiance, until her hope is torn and shredded, until her unheart cannot bear the absense of all those things that make a human, well, human. Zera is a villain, the instrument of death and destruction, and that's a refreshing change from all those special snowflakes that dominate YA fantasy. But there is also goodness in her, a desire to aid the helpless and defenseless, and that makes her mental turmoil all more excruciating. There is a constant battle inside of her, and Sara Wolf does a marverlous job describing it. Even when her inner monologues seem long and stretched, even when she can't tame the hunger and thoughts of deliciously ravaged bodies tempt her, even when the monster prevails, Zera's narration is unique, laced with sarcasm, dark humor and want, for something better and brighter.\n\n\u201cWhat's worse, Reginall - to be a monster, or to make monsters?\u201d\n\nIn Bring Me Their Hearts, Sara Wolf crafted a lush, intricate world with sumptuous history and lore; the various races, the religion conflicts, the war and its wounds, the etiquette and the customs enriched the story and opened a portal to compelling yet terrifying fantasy land. With magic sparkling in your fingers and liquor running in your veins, between banquets, balls and nightly escapades, witch purges and illicit meetings, you got to know the city of Vetris, its hypocrisy and its beauty, and you reveled in the court of lies and deceit. The plot was heavy on schemes and rivalries, the secrets of the royal family many, the hatred and the fear palpable, and while Zera tried to navigate herself in her make-believe new life, you followed her in stupor, unable to stand back and distance yourself.Zera was a snarky character, with a smart mouth and a tendency to say inappropriate things that somehow caught the attention of his royal highness, prince Lucien. The chemistry between them was a living being from the very start, with barbs and banters ignating the fire that threatened to consume them. I basked in the delicious tension and the witty comebacks, the stolen touches and the burning gazes, and I prayed for an outcome that would spare Lucien's life and give them a chance to be together. Lucien was a well-portayed, multi-layered character, and so was lady Y'shennria. Both of them awakened in Zera different emotions and needs, and witnessing the hunger whispering to her that she was unworthy of them was heartaching. And so was the ending that made me gasp in shock.Bring Me Their Hearts is a delightfully savage, spellbinding tale laden with deceit, sass and magic that will leave its bloody imprint in your (un)heart!*ARC generously provided by the publisher via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review.*Note: The quotes used in this review are from an uncorrected text and subject to changes.Review also posted on BookNest!"}, {"userName": "C.G.

And a few bloody tears and fantastic dresses along the way. Honestly it's just so much fun. And while I thought this was a standalone going in lmao no the ending basically pets you on the shoulder and then throws your feels off a cliff. So #nice. I'll just be sitting here on a tree stump crying for book 2.+ So it's a bit like part twisted-fairy-tale and part your classic fantasy romp. You know how in all the old fairy tales the Evil Queen is like \"BRING ME HER HEART\" although 1/10 very unclear what she wants to do with it. Eat it maybe??? Idk. Evil queens are very extra. So this book reminds me of that premise a lot! But here we have Heartless, who are basically body guards to witches. The witches cut out random people's hearts and put them in enchanted jars (nice) and then the Heartless chaps must do whatever the witches decree. PLUS the Heartless can only eat raw flesh and they have a psychotic Hunger voice inside them telling them to rip up everyone and eat them. So it's like zombies but fairy tales but awesome.+ I think the standout for me was how downright HILARIOUS it is! I reeeally like to laugh and there were just so many good lines! Zera is so so sassy. It's her coping mechanism, but she honestly just can't help herself. If someone opens their mouth -- BOOM. Zera has a witty comeback.+ Plus I found Zera so refreshing! She's not a fan of being a zombie-witch-body-guard and her #1 goal is to get her heart back (even if that means STABBING THE PRINCE) but she's delightfully witty and also relatable.+ I mean the characters were just prancing all over the page being amazing.I looooved them. There's:\u2022 strong female friendships\u2022 a really sassy bodyguard\u2022 a female-to-female mentor relationship which was soooo good\u2022 Prince Lucien being a snob but with a secret heart of gold\u2122Everyone was complex and dynamic and when the Squad\u2122 got together to get things done, it was FAB. I loved Zera, Lucien, Fione, and Malachite all snarking their way through espionage to save the world.+ And the world building!! It actually has it!! From actually building a complex and intriguing court to fleshing out the world with past wars and religions and usurpers in the politic realm?! I was really happy! Yay backstabbing and world building!+ The plot was the only thing I found a little lacking. But I mean, I loved the characters and was totally entertained so ?!? I will survive??? But I'd read one of the plot twists in The Orphan Queen. So it was kind of like: \"WHOOMP CALLED IT\" way too early. And then it's always obvious that when the assassin goes to kill the prince...of cooooourse she's going to fall for him. That's the POINT. But. I mean. It felt a bit safe and predictable. And a little long tbh...but I have such a bad attention span these days. The only thing I don't get distracted from is lunch. What can I say.All and all?! THIS WAS FUN. It was witty and sharp and backed by an interesting and powerful world. It discusses monsters and what it means to be one! Also I loved the emphasis on girls + with knives + who love pretty dresses. It wasn't a totally equal society, BUT it was full of powerful women and they weren't demeaned at every opportunity. Girls HAD SWORDS and didn't scorn femininity at. all and this is heckin' what I'm here for in epic fantasy.\"You've stolen from nobles?\"\"'Stolen' is such an ugly word.\" I wrinkle my nose. \"I prefer 'long-term-donation.'\"\"Where's your corset?\"\"I tried it on,\" I assure her. \"Five minutes of not being able to breathe was enough, thank you.\"\"It's the fashion,\" she insists. \"From Helkyris.\"\"Well now it's the fashion from Helkyris that's in the garbage can.\"\"You think so highly of yourself.\"\"If I do'nt, who will?\"(quotes are from the ARC and might change!)"}, {"userName": "Candace Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33995641-candace-robinson", "userReview": "The majority of new fantasy books lately have been boring me to tears.

The romance is an incredible slow and beautiful burn, because Zera is on a mission to take Lucien\u2019s heart, literally. The action was great with addicting writing! And that ending!

Thankfully this one turned into one of the times that the story lives up to the beautiful cover and I didn't regret my obsession with getting a copy.What\u00a0Sara Wolf has done with this story is taken a new twist on a zombie like character.\u00a0Zera is what is known as a Heartless.\u00a0 When Zera's family was killed by Heartless a witch,\u00a0Nightsinger, decided to spare Zera by making her into a Heartless instead of letting her die by taking her heart and with it she has control of Zera. A Heartless though is very zombie like in the urge to murder and their need for raw meat but still looking human and hanging onto a thread of her humanity Zera wants nothing more than her heart back and to be human again.When Nightsinger is approached to allow the use of Zera to infiltrate and get close to\u00a0Crown Prince Lucien d'Malvane Nightsinger makes Zera an offer she can't refuse. If Zera can attempt to pass as human and win the Prince's heart to allow Nightsinger to take his heart she will trade it for Zera's own and grant her freedom and her life back. Battling the monster inside of her Zera vows to bring Nightsinger the Prince but if she fails Nightsinger will crush her own heart.It didn't take long when starting to read this one to know I was really going to like Zera with her snarky comebacks showing her strong will even being a zombie like creature. And while the story with the Prince didn't give off a lot of surprises I did think though that the secondary characters and the relationships were a winner too. The story did have a bit of a slow pace to it and perhaps could have used a bit more action with the length but it still kept my attention all the way to the surprise cliffhanger ending. I'll definitely be looking forward to the next installment of this story to see where the author takes the characters next.I received an advance copy from the publisher via NetGalley.For more reviews please visit https://carriesbookreviews.com/"}, {"userName": "Wendy Higgins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9225614-wendy-higgins", "userReview": "OMG.

Her family still worship the old gods and the noble people have turned their back on them. This is Zera's cover story. She has a mission, one goal to steal the Prince's heart. How romantic! No wait I mean actually steal his heart. Prince Lucien d'Malvane, Archduke of Tollmount-Kilstead, fireborn, the Black Eagle. A prince with too many names but the most important one is the secret one. He has had numerous spring bride offerings but Prince Lucien's heart is cold. His love is hidden. Zera is a Heartless. She protects her witch with the price of her heart. Nightsinger has 3 heartless and Strikes a bargain with Zera for her freedom. Bring the Prince's heart and in exchange, they will have their freedom. Zera wants her heart back more than anything. A heartless is a human without a heart. They have a monster inside them. The monster wants destruction and is settled with raw meat. The heartless have a half-life. They cannot wander far from their witch. They still have interests and dreams but the hunger is always there. There is a war brewing between the witches and humans. The witches want to try and prevent the war but some humans want it. The goal of Nightsinger is to prevent a war. She isn't a bad person she is just trying to survive. Excellent storyline with some loveable characters. The prince is very swoon worthy and Zera is a strong beautiful leading lady. Lady Y'shennria, Zera's \"aunt\" is one of my favourite characters but everyone has a background story. Everyone is well developed and loveable in their own way. This book is so much more than I expected. It's the first in a trilogy of books and I'm already desperate for the next instalment. Bring me their hearts is enough to quench the monster but will leave you wanting more. 5+ stars out of 5. This is going on my favourite bookshelf. Loved it.

I didn\u2019t think Wolf could top herself as an awesome storyteller after the Vicious Series, but then she goes and gives us a Young Adult Fantasy that is totally out-of this-world. Amazing world building, witches, a heartless immortal soldier, a rebellious prince, and fantastic creatures\u2014it has it all. But\u2014yes, there\u2019s a but\u2014Wolf is killing me with her keep us readers dangling by our fingertips cliffhangers. I didn't think Wolf could leave me dangling more than she did in Lovely Vicious, but I was most definitely wrong! Sara Wolf is the queen of the mother-of-all cliffhangers. You know when you\u2019re on that next to the last page of the book, it's coming, you know it is, but you turn to the last page anyway...and there it is BAM. And you know Wolf has got you. Even if you're screaming, kicking and wanting to throw your kindle, Queen Wolf has hooked you, reeled you in and left you needing more, and I will be dangling anxiously and impatiently, waiting for Zera and Prince Lucien to be continued in the next book. Dang that cliffhanger, but I love Sara Wolf's storytelling; she is awesome.Now, I have three favorite characters in Bring Me Their Hearts that I totally fell in love with. First there is Zera, who is a sixteen year old Heartless and has the most wonderful, wittiest personality and sassy mouth. She\u2019s strongminded and opinionated, and she gives the prince more than he can handle. Then there is Prince Lucien, known as the Black Eagle of the West. Uh yeah, you'll just have to find out why he's called that when you read the story (even among royals they have their tattooed bad boy <3). Lucien won my heart with his strong, silent type, and most definitely his sexy broodiness\u2014got to love a stubborn prince. Now for the last: Malachite, who is the prince\u2019s bodyguard and a Beneather. I absolutely love him, the word cocky just doesn't do him justice. Mal is such a flirty tease, and he\u2019s trying hard to play matchmaker between the prince and Zera. And I adore his gotcha sexy \"wink\".Sara Wolf has done it again with her amazing skills as a talented writer and storyteller. Now I just have to not bite my nails to the quick until I get the second book with Zera, Lucien, Malachite and a lot more wonderful characters. Bring Me Their Hearts is a must read and the romantic tension between the Zera and Lucien is most definitely worth the wait as I dangle from Miss Wolf's cliff."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "4.5 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2018/06/03/...Bring Me Their Hearts by Sara Wolf was so much fun\u2014much more fun than its grisly premise would lead you to believe. The book stars Zera, who was murdered in a brutal bandit attack when she was just sixteen years old, but was then \u201csaved\u201d when the witch Nightsinger resurrected her by carving out her heart, keeping the organ safe in a magical jar. Now Zera has become a Heartless\u2014immortal, un-ageing, and unkillable by any earthly means, but this all comes at a very steep price. She is forever bound to serve Nightsinger, and to prevent herself from transforming into a mindless ravening monster, Zera must consume raw meat regularly to stave off the hunger.For three long years, Zera has dreamed of becoming human again, which would only happen if Nightsinger gave her back her heart. But now, the witch would give her that very chance to earn back her humanity\u2014with the stipulations being high-risk and dangerous, of course. Another Sunless War is threatening to break out, and in order to stop it from happening, the witches need a hostage they can control completely. Crown Prince Lucien would make the perfect target\u2014but only if he can be turned Heartless. To lure him into the witches\u2019 trap, Zera has been tasked to pose as a potential bride at the next Spring Welcoming, where she will mingle at the court, ingratiate herself with the other nobles, and attempt to steal Lucien\u2019s heart\u2014literally.Without a doubt, what made this book such a delightfully entertaining read was its main character. Zera is always quick on her feet with a wisecrack retort, but she does it in such an easy and charming way that it\u2019s hard not to like her immediately, especially when most of the victims of her sharp tongue deserve it. I can\u2019t remember the last time I\u2019ve cheered so hard for a protagonist, watching her take the royal court by storm and catching everyone there unawares. But Zera is also more than just a smart mouth and a sassy attitude; deep down she is also wrestling with a past filled with darkness and guilt. In fact, as time goes on, we find out that most of the time her flippancy is her response to her feelings of fear, loneliness, and uncertainty. As insistent as she is on calling herself a monster, she seemed wholly human to me, and for a girl with no heart who claims everything she does is to further her own gains, she sure cares a great deal about others.The world-building in this book is also exquisite. The relationship between a witch and a Heartless is a little like the one between a vampire and their thralls, except it is much more intricate and nuanced. Heartless are a witch\u2019s personal soldiers, but not all witches treat their Heartless like expendable chattel, and Nightsinger and Zera actually have something close to an affectionate bond. But while a witch can channel their magic into their Heartless to heal and help them, they can also put an end to them instantly by shattering their hearts in their magical jars, which means any kind of attachment between Nightsinger and Zera is still a very unbalanced power dynamic. This is a world full of old gods and ancient magic, and that\u2019s just one of many mysterious and complex systems working behind the scenes. Bitter rivalries and backstabbing powerplays also rage in the royal court of Vetris, which would ultimately determine whose influence wins out, affecting the fates of both humans and witches alike.The romance should be discussed here too, since it is so integral to the plot. That Zera and Lucien will eventually fall in love is sort of a foregone conclusion, because otherwise, where would be the conflict? Still, I liked that their romantic arc was developed steadily and carefully, with both of them getting to know each other before falling in love. It\u2019s the crux of the novel\u2019s premise after all, since it would be much easier to betray someone and rip out their heart if you saw them as a soulless enemy, but that changes drastically if the man you thought was a stuck-up and callous prince actually turned out to be a good person, with a lifetime full of hopes, dreams, and desires.To my surprise, this was one of the best YA romances I\u2019ve read in a while, though there were plenty of other relationships at play here that also deserve a mention, including the one between Zera and Lady Y\u2019shennria, the noblewoman helping the witches by pretending to be Zera\u2019s aunt. In truth, I probably enjoyed following their interactions even more than I enjoyed watching Zera and Lucien, because there was just something so earnest and heartbreaking about the desperate way Zera constantly sought Lady Y\u2019shennria\u2019s approval. When they eventually acknowledged each other like true family, I might have even shed a tear or two.Only a few flaws kept this book from a perfect rating. First, Zera reminds readers every few pages that all she wants is her heart and getting it back is the most important thing to her, yet she sure seems to enjoy sabotaging herself any chance to gets by not sticking the plan or by taking stupid risks. Second, after a while, it becomes clear that everyone involved is on the same side and wants the same thing, which made me think that a good sit-down and bit of decent communication could have solved a lot of problems and made everything a lot less complicated. Third, there was this awful cliffhanger\u2014except what happened was also kind of predictable, so I\u2019m still torn as to what to think about the ending.Still, when all is said and done, I had a great time with this book. Bring Me Their Hearts had everything I could ever want from a YA novel\u2014superb world-building, a fantastically well-written story, and a phenomenal protagonist I could emphatically root for. I originally set out to read this story about Heartless and heart-taking, never once expecting it to steal my heart so quickly and completely too. But now I am irrevocably hooked, and I want more."}, {"userName": "Aimee \u2665 | Aimee, Always", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5478965-aimee-aimee-always", "userReview": "If I had to describe this book in one word, that word would have to be annoying.

I am a Heartless.\u201d\n\nI THOUGHT THIS WAS A STANDALONE.spoiler alert: this is not a standalone.Okay not going to lie, this book was a bit cliche and predictable plot wise (you can tell from the blurb who\u2019s probably going to get together), but honestly it was buckets of fun.Bring Me Their Hearts is filled with killer, heart stealing witches, mischievous royalty, magic and swords and pretty dresses and so much witty and sarcastic humor.The story follows Zera who is a Heartless, bodyguards to whatever witch cut out their heart to keep preserved in a magical jar, as she infiltrates court life in an attempt to steal the heart (literally) of the Prince in order to stop a war and obtain her freedom.\u00a0There is some nice world building with a complex history of past wars and religions and kings. It was interesting to learn the hidden world of the court with all its lies and deceits.\n\u201cDoes he keep count? Does his number haunt him as my own haunts me?\u201d\nI really enjoyed Zera\u2019s character even if she was a bit over the top and extra. She\u2019s so hilarious, I love her dry, witty humor, and though she may be heartless she is so filled with heart and empathy.She uses dark humor in uncomfortable and awkward situations in order to cope, which I found super relatable.Prince Lucien and Malachite were a bit cookie-cutter, in my opinion, but honestly, I don\u2019t even mind because they were both just so absolutely charming and hilarious.Malachite was kind of the typical \u201cguard-best-friend\u201d type who treats the prince differently and tells Zera of all the ways he treats her differently from the suitors etc. etc.\n\u201cT\u2019ragan him af-artora, af-reyun horra: As we all should be, but as we all cannot be.\u201d\nHowever, he was also sassy and funny as hell and I found him adorable. I really loved learning about the Beneather culture and language.Lucien was your typical \u201carrogant-bored-prince-that\u2019s-actually-a-huge-softy\u201d, and again, it was fine. I still liked him. He has his flaws, he makes his mistakes, but he genuinely cares for his people and that\u2019s very admirable.Many of the characters are complex and interesting and just so charming. I loved all the friendships with all its witty banter, and the instructor-esque relationship filled with mutual respect and eventual love.\n\u201cAllow me to impart a bit of wisdom from my teacher; a blade is a blade\u2014no matter who wields it, it can still cut.\u201d\nThere\u2019s some sexism, but there were also a ton of powerful women, some who carried swords and some who were strong in all different types of ways.\n\u201cThis city is afraid. And fear turns the wisest and kindest men stupid and cruel.\u201d\nThe witches are not all inherently bad, the Heartless are not only just raw flesh-eating monsters, the King is not completely a heartless villain, nor do I believe that of the Archduke even if I dislike him very much.\n\u201cKilling only makes more hate, and the world\u2019s got enough of that right now.\u201d\nThe book poses the question of monstrosity and what it means to be a monster. In this society there is so much morally grayness. It is filled with people who were wronged, and people who would do practically anything to avenge those they love even at the cost of their own humanity.The people at court are horrid, and do horrid things to those below them and even to each other, but at the end of the day, they are all people just trying to survive.BUT THAT FREAKING ENDING! I am so upset, I hate cliffhangers and now I\u2019ll be forced to wait probably more than a year for the next one.Totally recommended if you\u2019re looking for a super fun young adult fantasy read! It had a semi-predictable plot, and I wouldn\u2019t go into it expecting anything new or particularly mind-blowing, but the characters are lovely and their relationships are complex and wonderful.It\u2019s entertaining and filled with humor, and I had a lot of fun reading it.

I usually write reviews right after finishing books, but with Bring Me Their Hearts I had to take a step back and actually work up the courage to write a review good enough to describe this masterpiece. Zera would do anything to go back to her old life, but sadly she is a heartless who's had her heart taken from her when she was at the brink of death, by a witch who saved her life and now she must do the witch's bidding. The only perks of her new life is that she cant be killed (at least not by normal things) and she doesn't age. But when rumours of another war start spreading the witch's devise a plan to turn the prince into a heartless to bribe the king, and the best person for the job is Zera. Posed as a long lost niece, Zera becomes one of the contenders to be the prince's new bride. Zera though the job would be easy, she never expected to start falling for the prince.Oh my goodness I can't even begin to describe how much I love Zera to you guys. She is brilliant, sassy, strong and such a well rounded character. She starts off as an amazing character, and then somehow gets even more amazing by the end. Half of the things coming out of Zara's mouth made me stop reading because I was laughing so hard, if you love the strong and witty female character types (like Sarah J Maas characters) you will definitely love Zera. The other leading characters in this novel were also very unique in their own way, but all absolutely brilliant. Lucien definitely has that brooding character trope, that actually has a heart of gold once you get to know him, and even though I though he was a tad stupid for trusting Zera so easily, it was still cute to watch his character development. Malachite was probably my favourite (right after Zera), he is the prince's guard and also his best friend, he is just as witty as Zera and makes a great friend. Throughout this whole book, I was really worried that I was going to have to give this book four stars rather than five for being too predictable. Because clearly right from the beginning you get the hint that yes Zera will end up falling for the prince and it will be very difficult for her to do her job, and she most likely wont end up doing it. You also can clearly tell who the bad guy of the story is, and assume that he will try to kill the main characters near the end of the book. And while yes these things did happen, there were two other twists in the story right at the end of the book that I was definitely not expecting. While I was pleasantly surprised that I was surprised (ya see what I did there?) at the events at the end of the book, I was a little sad because it has a huge cliffhanger ending and now I'll have to wait forever to find out what happens next.Overall, amazing main character, fantastic supporting characters and a great story in general. It was hilarious, serious and a truly fantastic novel. While it was a tad predictable, it did surprise me in the end. Fair warning, huge cliffhanger ending at the end, so this will definitely be a first novel in a series. I cannot wait to continue this series, and I will definitely be checking out more from this author."}, {"userName": "\u265b Garima \u265b", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25988362-garima", "userReview": "I want to read this so much but it is giving me  To Kill a Kingdom vibe so strong...I am scared..."}, {"userName": "Nadhira Satria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45365270-nadhira-satria", "userReview": "The synopsis.I NEED THIS NOW"}, {"userName": "Crazy4Books", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16445884-crazy4books", "userReview": "Bring Me Their Hearts is dark and captivating fantasy story that follows Zera, a witches heartless immortal thrall tasked by the witch Nightsinger with stealing the Princes heart in exchange for the one thing she wants above all else; her heart and all the past memories it contains. Once the witches have his heart Prince Lucien can be turned into a heartless thrall himself and used as a political prisoner to prevent an upcoming war with the humans. What Elizera didnt realize was the Prince is just as determined to stop this war as the wicthes. Will the price of freedom be worth making a monster of the only happiness she's ever known? I love me a witty smart mouth main character and Zera was definitely it. Her clever and snarky remarks made her perspective very compelling. Her potato comment was epic. I totally didnt see it coming and I will never look at a potato the same way again. The hunger living inside her since her heart was taken 3 years ago was irrational and destructive which made a great contrast with her sharp mind and caring personality. The side characters were well fleshed out and I really enjoyed Zeras relationships with them. Her complexe relationship with Nightsinger felt real and I loved how her relationship with her fake aunt Y\u2019shennria developped. Her court training to be presented as a potentiel bride for the Prince made them bond despite Y\u2019shennria fears.I didnt think Id come to love Lucien as much as I did, but his sneaky thieving ways and compassionate heart won me over. The bad boy with a heart of gold trope was well done here. It was sweet how much he came to care for Zera. It took some time, but after showing she was willing to put herself in danger to defend his people he started opening up to her. His bodyguard Malachite was a favorite with his funny and candid personality. Fione was more of a morally grey character willing to put others in danger to get revenge for the murder of the princess. I understood where she was coming from unlike her uncle Gavik. His motivations for being so cruel and wanting another war with the witches weren't clear to me. Im hoping we get more insight in the sequel.This book had some unique features that I really appreciated. The world building transports you to this whole new planet with 3 moons of different colors as well as ice poles to the East and the West and a sun that travels in the opposite direction. Theres also some awesome magic and a bunch of fascinating creatures. On top of witches and their heartless we see some fearsome goblin like creatures called Beneathers who keep the deadly serpent dragon Valkerax captured underground. We also get to see some lethal cat/lizard creatures called Celeons whose skills often have them working as guards and assassins. I need more of these intriguing creatures and magic in the next book. I even liked seeing the witches turn into a murder of white crows.The writing was simple and efficient while still making this darkly alluring world come to life with distinct elements. The pace was steady with a lot of tension cause by our main characters internal conflict and some action sprinkled throughout. It focuses more on the characters than the plot, but since I loved the characters and their relationships I was gripped from start to finish. The plot itself was predictable, but it still managed to surprise me at times and get my heart pounding. That cliffhanger ending has me in a panic for the sequel. I just love endings like that. This is definitely a new favorite and Id recommend it if you want a unique fantasy world with riveting characters.*received for review consideration*"}, {"userName": "Miranda (MrsLeif's Two Fangs About It)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15295977-miranda-mrsleif-s-two-fangs-about-it", "userReview": "Bring Me Their Hearts was everything I was hoping for when I laid eyes on this beautiful cover! This book was an enchanting, addicting, and unforgettable! I COULDN'T PUT THIS BOOK DOWN!The world the author created for this story was so unique and mesmerizing. The history and lore of this world were so fleshed out and it never felt like the information was given in info dumps. I loved learning about the culture, politics, magic, and the many conflicts brewing. With all of the schemes, intrigue, secrets, and rivalries in this book, I was on the edge of my seat! I felt the same pressures and anxieties Zera did when she was trying to navigate the rocky waters of this world. The main character, Zera, WAS THE SASSY FEMALE CHARACTER OF MY DREAMS! She was never afraid to say what was on her mind, which lead to some hilarious moments in this book. Zera was a complicated character that had A LOT going on, and I thought the author did a great job at developing her and showing the internal conflicts she was constantly facing. I also LOVED Lucien. OH MY LANTA, HE WAS SO DREAMY. His relationship with Zera made me swoon SO MANY TIMES. Their relationship was full of passion and banter, which filled my heart with so much joy. I thought their relationship developed at a believable pace that managed to make me beg for more. Overall, Bring Me Their Hearts was a thrilling adventure that sucked me in from the first page.

I am a Heartless.\u201d\nOh, this book was so entertaining! I love Sara Wolf's books and I've been very excited to read this book since I first heard about it because it sounded very intriguing and also the cover looks so pretty.\u00a0 Well, she didn't disappoint me. I absolutely loved this book. It felt like I was reading a dark fairy tale and I quite enjoyed the main character Zera. She's definitely the best thing I loved about this book because I just love snarky heroines. I also enjoyed the world building, the engaging plot, interesting characters, and the forbidden romance between Zera and prince Lucien. I actually thought that this was a stand-alone novel, but It's a trilogy and I'm so glad that there's going to be another book because I really want more of this world and its characters.\u00a0Sixteen Year old Elizera aka Zera is a heartless and immortal because she doesn't age and nothing can kill her. All the heartless are the soldiers of their witches. Zera was bound to the witch named Nightsinger who turned her into heartless three years ago when bandits murdered her entire family and she saved her life. With her heart stored in a glass jar, Zera needs to obey her witch's every command. Since her turning, Zera didn't see the outside world except for the woods surrounding them. For three years, she longed to become human again. When Zera is given a new mission which could finally bring her freedom that she longed for, she doesn't hesitate to take it. To prevent another Sunless war between Humans and Witches, Zera needs to bring Crown Prince Lucien's heart in exchange for her freedom but it's a risky mission because If she gets discovered, Nightsinger will destroy her heart rather than see her tortured by the ruthless nobles. Crown Prince Lucien\u00a0d\u2019Malvane hates the royal court because he knows the poison that's filled in their minds. Every girl in the kingdom is competing for a place beside him because of his royal status. In the Spring Bride Offerings, he needs to choose a bride even though he feels it was totally ridiculous and embarrassing. And then he meets the smart mouthed Lady Zera who's not afraid to challenge him. Zera needs to lure the prince into her trap so that she could finally steal the heart beating inside his chest. With so many lives at stake, Zera had to complete this mission without fail, but she never expected to start falling for him.\u00a0I enjoyed all the characters in this book. The main character Zera is totally badass! She's strong, fearless, smart, witty, cunning, and beautiful. Her wittiness is definitely the best part I liked about her. She's a heartless monster, but she's really not cruel because she does possess feelings. Everyday she fights with the monster inside her to keep the last ounce of humanity left in her. She eats raw meat to stave off the monster's raging hunger, but if she eats normal human food bloody tears will start falling from her eyes which is a painful experience for her. Lucien is a prince with many identities and I quite enjoyed his character. He's arrogant and also charming. He's not like the other ruthless nobles and honestly wants to help his people who're struggling to live, that's very admirable. I also liked Malachite, Lucien's bodyguard and also his best friend. He's a very intriguing character and I really didn't expect him to be so funny. He's totally hilarious! I want more of him! Lady Y'shennria, Zera's fake Aunt is a nice addition to the plot. She tutors Zera in etiquette even though she fears her. I enjoyed every interaction between them and how Zera\u00a0constantly sought her approval. And next we have, Fione. She belongs to a noble family and she has her own agenda. She might look fragile and vulnerable, but she shouldn't be underestimated.The plot was very interesting and refreshing! I was hooked to the story from the start till the end. Even though it was a bit predictable, it was well executed and never left me bored. To be honest, this book was focused more on the characters and less on the plot but I still enjoyed every minute of it because I really enjoyed the characters and their relationships. The slow romance between Zera and Lucien was well developed and I'm glad that it wasn't a insta-love thing. I loved every interaction between them and not to forget the witty banters. The twists and turns made the story interesting but the last one was quite shocking, I didn't see that coming. I loved the writing style of the author, It was simple yet addicting. I liked reading the book from Zera's POV, but I might've enjoyed this book a bit more if it was told in multiple POV's. The world the author created was very fascinating filled with magic and some interesting supernatural creatures. I would love to explore more of this world.Overall, I loved this book! Despite some cliched and predictable parts, this was quite an entertaining read. It was really a great start to a new series and that cliffhanger at the end had left me wanting for more. I seriously can't wait to read the next book. I highly recommend this book to all the YA fantasy lovers who loves dark fairytales with snarky heroines."}, {"userName": "mith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7621359-mith", "userReview": "3.5.

Then I realized that she was actually, LITERALLY trying to take the prince's heart and I was gone. I needed to get my hands on this thing and I'm so glad I was given the opportunity to read it! IT WAS SO GOOD. THE GOODSo many amazing things! Where do I even start?!Okay, first of all, the sassy wonder Zera was my favorite. Wearing fancy dresses and kicking ass, all while dishing out the snappy one-liners! I loved watching her grow over the course of the book and make new friends after being alone for so long. She's a flawed character that's had her fair share of hard times (to say the least), but I loved that Zera still kept her spunk and humor even in the darker moments. Such a relatable quality to me. Despite having a hard outer shell, she had a great sense of loyalty and love that I really admired.And of course, I OBVIOUSLY loved Lucien the dark haired prince with a heart of gold. The banter between him and Zera was great fun to watch and their romance was adorable. But the real relationship that I enjoyed watching was the one between Zera and Y'shennria. Good parents and/or guardians are always lacking in these young-adult books and it was so refreshing to see maternal relationship take center stage for once. To say they had a rough start would be an understatement, but by the end of the book, watching Zera and Y'shennria together gave my heart all the warm fuzzies!Lastly, I thought the world building was awesome! I was really fascinated by this little universe Wolf created and it was fun learning all the rules. The contrast between the witches in the forest and the snooty nobles in the city was interesting. I\u2019m curious to see how those opposing sides will merge if/when they fight in a war against one another.Oh, and by the way. MALACHITE IS THE BEST AND I LOVE HIM.

It was inevitable that I would choose to read and review this book as well. I\u2019ll be honest, it took me a hot minute to truly get into the story. Why? I have no idea. The main character is spunky and hilarious; I loved her immediately. I just couldn\u2019t, for the life of me, care for the story. The more I read though, the more interesting this new world became.
