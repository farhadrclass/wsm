Ursula, who hosts a haunted bus-ride throughout many of the locations explored in the book, covers such legends as Resurrection Mary (\"vanishing hitchhiker), Bachelor's Grove Cemetery (floating orbs, ghost-house, horse and carriage, and another \"white lady\" called \"the Madonna\"), The Biograph Theater where famed bank-robber John Dillinger was gunned down, and the \"Devil Baby\" of the Jane Addams Hull House.For further information, here is an article I wrote about some new ghosts in the area. Or check out this fascinating transcription of an expedition deep into the bowls of Bachelor's Grove braved by some friends and myself. Why not read this review of the supernatural bus tour too?"}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "Okay, this is not a well written non, and poorly edited and organized.. but someone told me it was a kind of authority on Chicago ghosts/hauntings, and then I find out Bielski runs a tour of haunted Chicago. The books is pretty boringly written, but it does name some of the legendary ghost stories in buildings and cemeteries in the Chicago area. I read it this year for my spring lit course on the literary and psych/psychological/spiritual/supernaturel phenomena (from Macbeth's 3 witches to Ocean at the End of the Lane's witches and such). I am having my students also read for today Corinne Mucha's fun graphic story, \"Growing up Haunted,\" and having students write of ghosts in their own lives/neighborhood/family. Getting some fascinating stuff (they can make stories up, too\u2026)"}, {"userName": "Juan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7405942-juan", "userReview": "Being from Chicago, this book seems like a must read to get to know some basics about our city's supernatural history. About the only bad thing about reading this book in 2017 is the fact that several locations no longer exist since this book was originally released during the 1990s. Its dated.On a side note, I read part of this back around the time it came out but never finished since I would have a tendency of stopping whenever a familiar location of mine was mentioned in the book. I grew up on the South Side so I was most familiar with Archer Avenue, Resurrection Mary, Bachelors Grove, and some of the more remote locations. When I went to college I once again found myself in familiar territory as my school and neighbors of Benedictine University were also mentioned in the book. At least two more books were written in this series so I will have to get to those eventually. Needless to day, Chicago and the suburbs certainly have more than enough paranormal activity going on regardless in whatever part of the city you may live.Another side note. I finally compelled to reread and finish this after having attended a paranormal panel at C2E2 with some former members of Ghost Hunters. They recommended reading Ursula Bielski's research from over the years. An interesting story they shared with us involved the Willowbrook Ballroom. So the nations convention on paranormal studies was held at the Willowbrook in 2016. Shortly there after, the Ballroom burned and was destroyed. Its possible to think it may have been related or not but it certainly adds an element to an already historical location. Plans are set to resurrect the Ballroom from the ashes as of Aug 2017."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/970762-jim", "userReview": "Some interesting stuff in here, but it was amateurishly written and repetative. Ultimately, I became bored with it. The approach veers between ghost hunting and folklore. Either approach could be entertaining, but the author never bothers to develop either one. The ghost hunting approach is a lot like those crappy shows you see on cable, where the ghost hunters talk a lot and then get excited over a brief light in the room that could be a spirit or reflected headlights from a car out on the street. The folklore is just a little too much like a high school termpaper."}, {"userName": "Vannessa Anderson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1380029-vannessa-anderson", "userReview": "All religions, including Christianity believe in some supernatural beings and experiences.

Great reading to kick off the Halloween season!Ms. Bielski has done her research and spins compelling tales about the ghosts of Chicago. I've taken her Haunted Chicago tours and this book just builds on that. (One of the reasons I got the book!)

What's great about reading this book and living in Chicago is that there is a Chicago Ghost tour that will take you to many places mentioned in the book. My favorite is the RoseHill Cemetary haunts because I used to live right by there. It is a very scary cemetary even when it's light out!"}, {"userName": "Katie Clark", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2789482-katie-clark", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to meet Ursula on one of her ressurection mary tours.

Unfortunately, it's weighed more heavily towards \"history\" than \"ghosts\", so if you were hoping for more of the latter, you'll be disappointed. Still, there are a few particularly memorable ghostly accounts, and it's an interesting read overall.

She can certainly spin a ghostly tale to the point that can go through a multi-sensory experience in the hearing or reading of these gathered tales.
