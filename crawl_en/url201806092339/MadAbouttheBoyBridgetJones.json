As all fans are aware, Bridget's appeal was that women, whatever their background, could identify with her. Sadly, this is no longer the case: she is a wealthy widow, does not work ( her ludicrous attempts at screenwriting can't be counted as work and they most definitely can't be counted as being funny ), has a nanny and a cleaner yet constantly whinges about her hectic life, easily loses 3 stones in 13 weeks and bags herself a toyboy 21 years her junior. Most of us would struggle to relate to her and this, perhaps, reflects the probability that Helen Fielding's life now is very far removed from that of most women. The thirty something Bridget was imperfect, insecure and loveable; the 51 year old Bridget is just a silly mare who needs a bloody good talking to by someone who lives in the real world as opposed to her ( once entertaining ) ridiculous friends. Had Mark Darcy lived, it's very difficult to imagine that he would have put up with such an annoying creature. This is the main reason that the book just doesn't work the others being that the attempts at amusing social commentary about matters such as competitive parents and domestic technology have been done before and that the book has obviously been written with the film in mind. Up until the last 50 pages I was going to rate it 2 stars ( v generous owing to nostalgia ). However, as the predictable ending, with its clumsy parallel with 'Pride and Prejudice' ( yet another one ), unfolded, I nearly threw the book on the fire and so could only award it 1 star."}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800803-kay", "userReview": "After hearing what the book is supposed to be about and the direction it's supposed to go in,"}, {"userName": "Mimi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1704951-mimi", "userReview": "[Mark Darcy is dead was a really stupid move.

Bridget Jones at a new stage in her life, as a widow and a mother, it seemed like it could be an interesting idea. If Helen Fielding wants Bridget to be an older singleton, I do think that it's better this way than - for example - if they had been married and then divorced, or just never managed to uncross their signals once and for all. But this book - oh my. While it seems like Helen Fielding really wants you to chuckle with fondness over Bridget being the same old Bridget, I felt like her version of Bridget Jones at 51 was a bit too hollow, or too facile, perhaps.Yes, Bridget would perpetually forget school permission forms and musical instruments. Yes, she might be too distracted by her own concerns to notice a septic fingernail. And it's fine for her to not know exactly where Germany is - as noted in The Edge of Reason. But I do think that if she was working on a screenplay adaptation of Hedda Gabler, that she would at least have a copy of the original play showing the correct author and spelling of the character's name. This is a minor plot point, but it shows the larger issue with this book - it veers from making Bridget seem stupid to making Bridget a character that it is hard to believe in.Maybe part of that is because Bridget's new circumstances are less relatable - she has a nice townhouse and a nanny and no need to work for money. Through the course of these books, she has morphed from Eliza Bennett to Anne Elliot, and somehow landed at Emma Woodhouse. The bits that seem to try to make Bridget relatable are all to do with crisis about the children - a look at how adorable and funny these little people are sort of humor. I still remember the scene where Magda and Jeremy had that blazing row outside of Bridget's flat, while her bathtub was overflowing and the car alarm was going off all over - it was screamingly funny. Nothing in this book really raises a genuine laugh.There are a few nice moments in it - when she has the moment with Jeremy where they are both being extremely sad about Mark, and when - as part of that same scene - she thinks about how she has spent the last 20 years not wanting to hurt the feelings of a group of Cosmo's circle who are consistently rude to her. Those both felt very real and true, so much so that they almost seemed like part of a different story altogether.The narrative structure of this book -which sticks to the standard diary form, but jumps through time from the opening scenes back in time to an earlier period, then catches up with the opening scenes time period about half way through, continues through linear time until the end, when it fast forwards to a Happy Ending quota. Aside from the part that day entries in the diary are so sprawling that they sometimes now go on for multiple chapters, the overall structure and time movement doesn't make much sense. Time as a whole seems a bit problematic for Fielding in this installment - with Bridget being 51, with her oldest child at age 7 - she must have had her first baby at 44. This is, at least, nine years after the end of the last book, when she and Mark were planning their lives together. Sure, maybe it took awhile for them to get it all together, but with all the previous mention of biological clocks, doesn't it seem like they would have tried for kids right away? Or if not, that there would be some mention of why? (It seems rather like the answer is so that Bridget's children can be Cute!Little!People!) Bridget's friends are all more or less intact - although Tom is now a top psychologist (really?) and Jude has remained single after her divorce (10 months after the wedding) from Vile Richard. Shazzar has moved to America with her husband, which may or may not be a metaphor for the voice of feminism becoming more distant as Bridget ages. As opposed to the previous books, however, where the friends had actual subplots of their own (Tom's plastic surgery/disappearance, for example), they seem rather one note in this installment. Tom's obsession with Gwenyth Paltrow's lifestyle blog is horned in at every possible opportunity, but to no real end. It's not even that funny.Roxster, who is the toy boy that Bridget takes up with, is a merry sex god who seems to have no personality of his own. He's also 30, although his character seems to live and act more like he just got out of university (lives with three other boys and obsessed with food). It's lovely that he is so nice to Bridget and helps her to get back on the horse of dating, but you don't really care about him very much. Also, her obsession with texting and twitter makes Bridget a worse version of herself - distracted, and actually rather rude. Also, their tweets go on for pages, and if you are not familiar with the way the @handles work, it is very difficult to tell who is talking, and to who.The True Love Interest is easy enough to spot, as he is the one who takes on the role of swooping in every 50 pages or so, scowling or saying something a bit snide to Bridget, and then disappearing for a long bit of Roxster obsession. Argh. Part of my issue is that I didn't much like The True Love Interest in general (he's not just a bit rude to Bridget at first, he's actually insulting her in front of her son) and part I didn't like the way Bridget gushes about him toward the end \"HE'S SUCH A MAN.\" And what was up with the coda where they decide to get all the children christened at the end? It felt weird and tacked on and awkward. Book is simply not v.g.

But it was surprisingly fun to read about her adventures in dating and parenthood. The book made me laugh out loud several times, and I often found myself smiling while I read.The novel opens with Bridget excited about dating a younger man and writing a screenplay, in addition to being a single parent of two children. As you may have already heard -- and which is revealed early in the book -- Bridget's husband, the wonderful Mr. Mark Darcy, was killed in an accident while working in Africa, and now she is finally coming out of her grief and depression to start dating again.I think so many women fell in love with the Bridget Jones books (and the delightful movie versions) because she allowed us to laugh at ourselves and our funny obsessions with dieting and men and self-improvement projects. It was smart of Helen Fielding to update the story because that generation of women has matured and now has other issues to deal with, and who better to help us cope with laughter than our dear old friend Bridget?One new thing that Bridget tries is social media. She opens a Twitter account and quickly gets obsessed with how many followers she has. She feels pressure to tweet clever things, and then embarrassment after tweeting while drunk. And when she meets a young man on Twitter she likes to flirt with, she learns how much fun texting can be:\"The fantastic thing about texting is that it allows you to have an instant, intimate emotional relationship giving each other a running commentary on your lives, without taking up any time whatsoever or involving meetings or arrangements or any of the complicated things which take place in the boring old non-cyber world. Apart from sex, it would be perfectly possible to have an entire relationship that is much closer and healthier than many traditional marriages without actually meeting in person at all!\"In addition to the humor of modern life, there is also a sweet side to the story. Bridget genuinely loved her husband and was devastated by his death. Her plans for self-improvement and forced cheerfulness are so touching because she is desperately trying to be a good mum to her kids, even though she'd rather stay in bed, wallow in her grief and eat chocolate ice cream.If you enjoyed the first two Bridget Jones books, you will probably like this one. There is humor, there is romance, and there is even a happy ending.

It's a fact. We love Bridget because she's normal, her bum is the same size as ours, and she's having a midlife crisis. Heck, I'm turning 24 and I'm having a midlife crisis. We women relate to Bridget.Why? Because if Bridget can snag a Mark Darcy, then we all can. Mark, Mark, Mark, Mark Darcy. He's the love of our lives, the man of our dreams and we all gave a big collective sigh when he and Bridget got together. Then recently, I found out something completely shocking.

He's dead.Killing off Mark Darcy is like...letting Voldemort live. Like Darth Vader taking over the world (did he take over? IDK, I don't watch Star Wars).

I assume that much of the hostility derives from Fielding's decision to do away with the beloved Mark Darcy in a horrible accident, and to set the novel at a point in time five years later, when Bridget is beginning to recover from the shock of her grief. This is not classic chick lit in the manner of the original two Bridget Jones novels; there is romance, yes, but this is not the tale of a twenty- or even thirty-something looking for Mr. Right. Our heroine is still neurotic, but life experience has given her character more weight. Her experiments with social media (Twitter, internet dating)are genuinely funny, not because Bridget is hopelessly flaky but because she is middle-aged and struggling to re-enter a world that has moved on without her. Her efforts to lose weight and find meaningful work are less about attracting a man than they are about reclaiming a sense of self out of the fragments of a shattered life. And the search for love - the ultimate success of which gives the last third of the book a satisfying sweetness - is tempered and enriched by Bridget's relationship with and responsibility for her two adorable, fatherless children.

In her place is a 51 year old widow obsessed with finding a man (yes, still,- and while we're on the subject, what kind of a name is Roxster?!), losing weight (yes, still, - a referral to an obesity clinic at a size 14? Really Helen? Way to relate to a huge chunk of your original fans there...) and booze (mouthful of wine in the middle of a children's diarrhea/vomit incident?

Otherwise, you'll sit as I did, cringing for this ridiculous woman. Just keep in mind when reading this that Bridget is no longer in her thirties and trying to work out where her life is going. She's 51, with children raised by a Nanny (even though she doesn't work) and a stupid boyfriend. Her friends haven't grown up either, and her mother is still commenting on her life even though she's now in her seventies. Helen seems to think we've all forgotten who Bridget is - lines from the first two books and films crop up repeatedly. \"Daniel, my former emotional f*ckwit boyfriend and Mark's former arch-enemy\" or \"Running around naked on his parents lawn\". Look, I'm all for finding love and discovering who you are no matter what your age, but when these characters are supposed to be in their fifties and they're still having telephone conversations that involve the words \"what colour are your knickers, Jones?\" - it's time to stop reading. Helen made a huge mistake getting rid of one of the most popular characters, but she made an even bigger one by writing this drivel in the first place. It's obviously written with the intent of being turned into a film, because it's lost all the sparkle of the first two books and instead is heavily reliant on visuals that will work in a Hollywood movie.

But we all knew that, right? It all came together for series author Helen Fielding just once, admittedly more than it does for some people, but she\u2019s never again been able to find that same balance of characters, plot, truths and one-liners as she had in our introduction to this once-lovable, relatable and bumbling character. Pity. \u201cBridget Jones: Mad About the Boy\u201d finds our foot-in-mouth lead at age 50 with two young children and, eeps, no Mark Darcy. He\u2019s dead. He died doing his do-gooder work. No spoiler alert. Fielding dropped this nugget before the book was released. So now B Jones is practically a born-again virgin, so say her indiscernible friends. They insist she get back in the game and toss a bunch of 2013 internet words at her to help her find a man. She latches on to Twitter and begins broadcasting her life to a steadily growing following. So now, in addition to units of alcohol and calories, she keeps track of her followers. As all of this is unfolding, she is working on a film adaptation of Hedda Gabler, though somehow she has gotten this project to the point of production meetings without knowing who wrote the original work, nor how to spell Gabler. So. In Tweets Roxster, a 30-year-old who woos her in 140-or-less character flirtatious blips. Eventually they move to texting, then dating, then navigating the complexities of a relationship between an older-woman-with-kids and a younger-man-with-roommates. None of this is very interesting. Not the Twitter and text banter. Not the constant search for a babysitter -- which brings bad boy Daniel back into the scene in a way that isn\u2019t at all believable. Fielding writes the \u201ctoy boy\u201d segments as though she\u2019s heard about Twitter and she\u2019s heard about text messaging \u2026 she\u2019s just never done it or known anyone who has. The ending is very predictable. Fielding employs a plot technique that worked the first time she tried it on Bridget, but now seems obvious and, frankly, pretty lame -- the same way it would if you or I were to dig back into a 20-year-old bag and test some of our old moves while wearing our current life. Pa-thet-ic. Oh. Here's one thing, though. For what is supposed to be a comic novel, the sad parts are really well drawn and, well, really sad. Like, \"Here. Attach this dumbbell to your soul\" sad. At least twice, while Bridget was reminiscing about Mark Darcy, I felt just sick with the weight of it all. So that was weird. Maybe years ago we all liked Bridget because we had grown up with the blonde, coup-driving, size 6 Wakefield twins and, suddenly, here we had Bridget and her granny panties, getting loopy on wine and weeping into the sleeves of her jammies. If she so much as tried to toss her hair she would probably end up in traction. She was a girl who aimed for an ideal and somehow ended up worse, but secretly better, than where she started. And ultimately she found a partner who wasn\u2019t looking for someone who can walk in a straight line without tripping over something. In fact, he found her clumsiness endearing. But first there was a lot of loving to hate the wrong man and hating to love the right one. And everyone knows that shit is the marrow of being a 20-something. Much of this book feels like it was written to be immediately adapted into a movie. A lot of the gags don\u2019t translate to the page and you can practically see Renee Zellweger\u2019s \u201ctoo-proud-to-cry-because-my-undies-are-showing\u201d smile. I knew this book would suck, just like the second Bridget Jones book sucked. And maybe, upon rereading, the first one sucks, too. Who knows.

We've all been THERE! Seriously! We've all been in actual prison, in Thailand! That's why we read Bridget Jones books -- because we can all, like, relate so HARD!pfffft. Please.If you liked the other Bridget Jones books, read this one. It's as simple as that. Bridget is as endearingly baffled as ever, and she's a lot of fun to watch. That said: Yes, I enjoyed the first two books more than I did this one. But that's because I'm shallow and picky. Bridget has two small children in this book, and Helen Fielding found it necessary to have a lot of extremely detailed descriptions of various bodily excretions. I just really hate that kind of thing.Also, okay: Remember all the terrific scenes in The Edge of Reason with Bridget and her best friend's kids, where Fielding really nailed how kids talk and wrote some terrific dialogue for some very young characters? Well, she kind of fell down on that part of the job in this book. Bridget's daughter has a part-time lisp -- not an actual speech impediment, but one of those \"I'm the author and I don't think readers will remember this is a really young kid unless I make her talk funny\" tells that lazy writers employ. That got old quickly.But I'm quibbling. This story is funny, and often genuinely moving. Oh, and guess what, reviewers from the New York Times, the L.A. Times, and any other papers who thought that women readers wouldn't be able to relate to a widow in her early fifties? I'm in my forties, and I found myself identifying fondly with many of Bridget's worries. She's intimidated by effortlessly glamorous moms. She can't figure out how to use the remote now that they all look and act like advanced-physics calculators. She worries about her weight and then feels guilty about being so shallow. She knows she should eat healthy, but wants to eat the yummy bad stuff because, hello? Yummy.I can relate."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4878642-melissa", "userReview": "Helen Fielding, what have you done?Aside from the very controversial plot twist that has shaken the Darcy Nation to its foundation, there are two huge problems with this story: (1) It's really slow (2) Bridget Jones is still, well, the same Bridget Jones, and it doesn't fully work anymore.Back in the '90s, Bridget Jones was my homegirl. Fun, carefree, totally neurotic, and extremely funny, she was so relatable. What living breathing member of Gen X didn't have their Jones moments back then? But the '90s are long over, and now she has children, and (sort of) responsibilities. And so does a huge portion of her audience, so the old gimmicks, such as the calorie counts and alcoholic bev tallies, don't resonate anymore. There are definitely some aspects that are spot-on, like the mass amount of \"reply all\" messages from the school moms, the attempt to *not* look like the mom from Good Luck Charlie, and reading books about French kids and why they are infinitely better. And she is still Bridget, doing things like calling the annoyingly perfect mom Nicolette, \"Nicorette.\" But the rest ... eh, not so much. The screenwriting plotline was ridiculous. The nonstop Twitter/text banter between Bridget and Roxster was tedious. The reason why I read books is because I can only take so much @ and RT, and whoop, there it is for at least 300 pages. Even the ending, which was charming and happy, just came out of nowhere. WHY did we just spend 300 pages with Roxster when we could have built up the ending and gotten to know this essential character a bit more? And last but not least, there's the controversial plot twist. I'm not a Mark Darcy purist, but I don't understand why this had to go down. Would a story about Bridget juggling marriage and motherhood be too been-there, done-that? There have been a couple comparisons to \"I Don't Know How She Does It\" but I think Bridget Jones' version would have been better, because she is Bridget Jones, after all. All that said, I didn't fully dislike it. It did have some charming parts. But the Bridget Jones franchise has officially played itself out. Maybe Helen Fielding can focus her next project on \"Nicorette\" who has all the makings of a fascinating story."}, {"userName": "Lian Dolan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5140396-lian-dolan", "userReview": "Flashes of the Bridget we love and the Helen Fielding we love, but not enough. Dang. I wanted to see what Bridget had made of herself and I was rooting for Helen Fielding to find some new obstacles for Bridget to tackle in her own endearing way. But a lot of this book felt recycled from other books- particularly I Don't Know How She Does It- about crazed moms, internet dating, and other middle- aged crises from weight gain ( still?) to how to manage trendy fashion. And the fact that so much of the story takes place via Tweets doesn't improve the situation.The moments where we do see a real 51 year old woman who finds herself widowed and still grieving 4 years later are the best moments in the book. I wish Fielding's editor had trusted the \"Bridget Jones generation\", like me, to have grown up, too. We didn't need to see the Bridget of 20 years ago, so the dating- the- younger- man subplot seemed very tired and contrived. A Grown-Up Bridget for Grown-up readers would have been great."}, {"userName": "Helle", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6909470-helle", "userReview": "[Mark Darcy has died and has left her heaps of money, something which probably isn\u2019t even a spoiler (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "[Mark is dead!

I did get used to Bridget as a single parent, and many of her antics are as endearing and as outrageous as in the first two books. But no Mark Darcy and the fact that Fielding had made him die in such terrible circumstances really did do a number on me and my emotions. Thus, while I certainly did like Mad About the Boy by the end, I also did not truly love it, and will never be able to truly love it (there is simply too much sadness, and a for me nastily gratuitous sadness that I wish the author had refrained from using). And furthermore, since I really do neither like nor even agree with the very concept of Twitter/Facebook, while I could smile a tiny bit at Bridget trying to make friends on social media, I was also not only rather bored by and at this, I also kind of wanted to shake some common sense into her (my kind of common sense). It was always so nice that Bridget was at least somewhat as much of a technophobe as I am, and not all that \"connected\" and into social media, and when that changed, I have to admit that I felt both somewhat annoyed and kind of abandoned (and one major and important thing Mad About the Boy has definitely shown me, is that I was not and am not missing anything with regard to social media, and that I will continue to stay away from especially Twitter, and more than a bit gladly).

I knew the 'Big Spoiler' before going in. I admit it tainted my pre-conceived hopes for a third Bridget Jones novel, but I resolved to enjoy the book for what it was. Alas, that proved more difficult than even I had expected. Fielding said Darcy 'had to die' because Bridget 'needed to be single'.Actually, no, I disagree. The thing is, what we loved about Bridget was that she was relatable. Even in the more bizarre situations that had little to do with real life (a la the whole drugs mule storyline in book 2), Bridget always felt like one of us (despite being ever so upper middle class). We understood her.And we would have understood her if, even in the best, healthiest most loving relationship, she lost her way. It happens to the best of us. And every part of the story here where we're able to connect most with Bridget, when she's most vulnerable, could easily have been written within her marriage to Mark.Can Fielding honestly think that no happily married woman has ever had doubts, ever lost her sense of self in the midst of mother, wife daughter? We would have still loved Bridget as we watched her struggle along with the majority of womanhood who sometimes loses their way. We didn't need Bridget to be single...we've been there before with her. We WANTED to move onto the next phase of he life. And we didn't necessarily NEED life to be perfect a la Happily Ever After with Darcy. Just something that felt truthful and real. The insecurity of getting older, losing our desirability, losing our sense of self, trying to adapt to modern fashion/technology etc, trying to find our sexuality, sensuality, intimacy again. All of the themes of the novel could so easily have been drawn upon without killing off Darcy. And that's the thing that just so jars with this novel, because the after effects of the thing that actually doesn't happen in the novel, leaves such a bitter taste in the mouth. It was done in such a brutal way. And yes, I'm perfectly aware that women can be widowed young, with very young children, and that really horrible brutal things happen in real life, but here it just felt like a ploy to play on our sympathies: \"I won't just make you weep to know Bridget lost the love of her life, but really wring out every ounce of emotion. Why don't I make the children young, 2 years, that's young. Hey, 3 months is even better. Really make the fuckers cry\"It just seemed so cynical and crass. However, there were some things to like here. The children were adorable, even if the phonetical spelling of Mabel's lisp did get a bit tedious. The new characters were nice additions, particularly Talitha, although I feel Rebecca was wholly underwritten. I actually really like Roxster. He could have so easily been written as a cliche...young, dumb etc. but he was a nice, regular guy, and the relationship played out perfectly. So full marks there.And Mr Wallander? Well. What's there to say...he was lush. The whole romance with him though, that was a little less satisfying than the character himself. Despite being completely obvious from the beginning that he was 'the one' the act silly relationship felt so rushed at the end of the novel, and although as readers we were aware of his worth for a long time, it felt as if Bridget just suddenly fell in love, jut like that. Loved Daniel in the story: it was great to see him stay true to character, treading that very fine line between a loveable rogue and sleazy creep, falling the wrong side every now and then.There's so much more I could ramble on about, like the complete absenteeism of Shaz. Yes, friends come in and out of our lives, but that doesn't feel true of this character. Surely we would have heard Gand takes of life from the USA? Especially given Bridget's new found love of technology and social networking?Ultimately, the book lacked substance, as did our much loved heroine unfortunately.

It's kind of patchy and there are things in it that really annoyed me, but I won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read it. The ending is rushed and not enough care is taken in some parts, whereas other parts are WAY too repetitive (ooh would love to discuss this further with people who've finished it) BUT for one reason only it works and that is a big reason...I LOVE BRIDGET JONESShe is still my favourite character in all literature I think. And to see her as a mum and a widow is really wonderful. She was my 20s, along with Friends, gastropubs and the Spice Girls and I love the way she has retained her character and it works in the context of the book. I love Helen Fielding's writing, her sharpness, eye for detail, and the little things that imbue Bridge with her character. Just as the column about Princess Di was the most moving things I read about her death in the week after it happened, her writing about Mark, her children, the sad parts of her life is sooo good, and there were at least 10 places where I laughed out loud too. I love how brave it was to kill Mark off, and how reimagining her life in this new way works (seriously though, what are those kids doing in those awful schools with those dreadful parents? put them in the local state school and save yourself cash and a whole load of trouble!)Ultimately I feel protective of Bridget and I think lots of people do. She's silly, but whether there's 5% of her in you or 95% (I'm more the latter...) she's a little bit of all of us. To try to make her into something representative of women today and draw some larger picture about what this says about women who enjoy her is really silly and sexist.
