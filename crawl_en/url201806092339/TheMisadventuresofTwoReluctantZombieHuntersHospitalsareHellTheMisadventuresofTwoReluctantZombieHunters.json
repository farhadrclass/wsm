The first book found two women at a comic convention when a zombie apocalypse starts. Second finds them heading to a hospital to tend to their wounded - same day. Possibly moronic in a way - what don't you do in a zombie outbreak? Go to a hospital (or a mall, or a large meeting place, or . . etc.). And - the didn't really need to go to a hospital. It seems slightly forced. They have a guy with a broken arm. They are deeply into 'being prepared'; it's one of the reasons they survived at the comic con - none of them know how to set up a splint? Immobilize the arm, etc. Sure, won't fix the broken arm but it'll hold it until they find medical help. Instead of going to the hospital, which is basically guaranteed to be crowded with zombies, they should have gone to . . . well, basically anywhere they might find a doctor or nurse (it's a zombie apocalypse, you don't want to get to complicated about this); one of those 24 hour emergency places - or a animal hospital or something. Whatever is nearest. Scope it out first, of course, for 'infestation'. But a hospital? Yeah, you want to steer clear of that.

Roxy and KL are back again in this fast paced thriller thriller. This time they are at a hospital looking for supplies before they head home. Well that's the plan anyway but of course we all know that nothing goes as planned in a zombie apocalypse. \t\t\t\t\tRight from the start this talk sucked me in and gobbled me up. I was so enchanted by this exciting and often funny story. It was wonderful! One of the best things about this book was the all the amazing sarcasm, it truly made the book great! Another good thing is that you can put it down for a time and when you go back to it you will be immersed again within seconds. Even if zombies aren't your thing I think you will love this series, it is truly a delight!"}, {"userName": "Loek Krancher", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28320079-loek-krancher", "userReview": "A darn good book!The freaking zombie apocalypse is not over and the zombies stil have an insatiable hunger for fresh flesh but this doesn't stop them for rescuing a woman. They are willing to go to all lengths to get her but what they find instead is not what they expected. They must fend for themselves in order to survive. It doesn't take long for all hell to break loose. I flew through the first book and with this second one, I devoured the words even faster. You had to know what happened next. This story was told full of humor, sarcastic humor. The monoloques were hilarious and the story has great twists that keeps you on your toes and breathless to the very end. It's not like any other zombie book you have ever read. It's told in a very different way and has interesting characters. Carol Ann is quite spunky, weird and cute at the same time. I really enjoy her share in the story. The hospital setting was pretty cool but creeped me out. Everything in there was yucky. I was completely enthralled with this book and couldn't put it down. It had me scared and laughing out loud. It is one crazy adventure. I surely hope there will be another installment to come."}, {"userName": "Tracy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2004460-tracy", "userReview": "Another wild ride!This second installment is just as gross, just as hilariously inappropriate and just as much fun as the first!

Proxy and KL are finding themselves in unexpected, sometime tense but always sarcastically humorous situations.

Bad habit to break ... love the nun puns!"}], "description": "Follow our not so reluctant Zombie Hunters on an irreverent and satirical romp through the Zombie Apocalypse. Nothing is sacred, and everyone and everything is fair game when it comes to KL's blades and even sharper sense of humor. They already escaped the Con, but not without injury. A quick trip to the hospital is in order, but nothing is ever easy in a Post-Apocalyptic world, especially on day one. KL, Roxy and their crew end up on a rescue mission at the local Catholic Hospital...and you know what that means. Nuns...Zombie Nuns, and they've developed a couple of new bad habits. This is book 2 of the Series....and like the Apocalypse, we expect this to be a long, messy ride full of twists and turns and a few surprises you won't want to miss. Carol Ann says you are all invited, and you don't want to upset that little girl.", "title": "The Misadventures of Two Reluctant Zombie Hunters: Hospitals are Hell\n      \n          (The Misadventures of Two Reluctant Zombie Hunters #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31822702-the-misadventures-of-two-reluctant-zombie-hunters", "average": 4.45, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1472816606l/31822702.jpg", "reviews": 6, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7452940.Rhavensfyre", "name": "Rhavensfyre"}], "type": ["Lesbian", "Horror", "Lgbt"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31822702-the-misadventures-of-two-reluctant-zombie-hunters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25100946-rest-and-relaxation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29612214-ransom-s-redemption", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20830253-life-is-not-a-country-song", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38866246-healing-springs", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19140549-switching-gears"]}
