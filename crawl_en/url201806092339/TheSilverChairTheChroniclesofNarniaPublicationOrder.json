How is a middle-aged feminist nonbeliever supposed to feel about this contradictory volume?Pro: Jill Pole is a strong, active, fun, funny, vigorous girl that any reader, male or female, will be happy to have as a protagonist. Con: Jill's old enough to be active, but young enough not to be a sexual being. Which is clearly the only reason Lewis is comfortable having her around, because:Con: Once again, Lewis only allows grown women as characters when they're scary, evil, beautiful, and seductive in equal parts. In this volume, the villain is the brilliant, ruthless Queen of the Underworld. Pro: Jill is a fully developed character who shows that kids can be strong and important without being paragons of virtue. One of the lines I remembered all my life after reading this book as a child is her reply to Aslan when he asks her why she was standing so near the edge of a cliff (and putting both herself and her friend in danger in the process). \"I was showing off, Sir.\" I love how she says this, without flinching. She messed up, and there's nothing to do but own it.Pro: Because of moments like the above, Jill is more enjoyable to follow on her adventures than Lucy. I love Lucy, but she's cute and sweet and pretty much flawless. Jill gets tired, impatient, sick to her stomach with fear, sulky, and unreasonably angry. She also knows when to fight and when to run. I can relate to that.Con: This is the only full-length story of Jill's adventures. (The Last Battle so does not count. More about that later. Like, in another review.)Con: Quite aside from the relatively passive sexism of Lewis' pitting pre-sexual girls against dangerously seductive full-grown female villains, he also displays active sexism in this book. At the very end, he makes a point of pointing out that the terrible, incompetent Head of Jill's awful boarding school is a woman. Literally. \"And then the Head (who was, by the way, a woman)...\" Really? Well, that explains everything. Pro: Lewis does some of his best characterization in this book. Minor spoiler: At one point, Jill, Eustace, and Puddleglum discover to their horror that the meat they've been eating was actually a talking beast. Their separate reactions as they put down their forks are brilliantly described:\"Jill, who was new to that world, was sorry for the poor stag and thought it was rotten of the giants to have killed him. [Eustace] Scrubb, who had been in that world before and had at least one Talking beast as his dear friend, felt horrified; as you might feel about a murder. But Puddleglum, who was Narnian born, was sick and faint, and felt as you would feel if you found you had eaten a baby.\"Con: Once again, Lewis backs the wrong horse, historically speaking. Jill and Eustace are together on this adventure because they go to the same school. Yes! Really! Can you believe it? Boys and girls, attending school together! What's next???Pro: It's kind of funny to think that someone as brilliant as Lewis could fall so cleanly into the losing camp on this issue. Pro: Lots of Aslan. Con: As a symbol of the Christian God, he's not at his best here. For instance, he tells Jill at the beginning of her adventures, \"Here on the mountain I have spoken to you clearly: I will not often do so down in Narnia.\" Even as a child and certainly now, my first thought was, \"Why?\" If you already accept divine inscrutability as necessary or at least inevitable, this flies fine; if you don't, this doesn't help. Pro: Puddleglum is one of the finest fantasy characters ever. His name and his \"tells\" are Dickensian in their genius, but he never falls into reflexive predictability. He's a weird, quirky, deeply appealing hero.Pro: Happy ending for every kid who's ever been bullied at school.Conclusion: Once again, Narnia is awesome no matter how old and skeptical you get."}, {"userName": "Daniella", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1397575-daniella", "userReview": "Finally, a proper novel! Thank you, Mr. Lewis. Sixth time's the charm, eh?The Silver Chair is my favorite out of all the Narnia books. Not only does it have all the usual elements of this wonderful, rich fantasy world Lewis created, but the characters are better, at least in my opinion, the story feels less contrived, and it has the added benefit of being a proper novel. That is to say, it has: a) an actual plot; b) an identifiable climactic point; and c) a clear, concise denouement. For once, I wasn't left scratching my head at the end and going, \"What the hell was the point of that?\"In this book, we're reunited with Eustace, the Pevensies' cousin, who has turned into an all right guy since we first met him in The Voyage of the Dawn Treader. Pity how he's kind of bland now that he's not an insufferable git anymore. Fortunately, it wasn't Eustace, but his schoolmate Jill who really made the book for me. Jill is a modern sort of girl; she has new age hippie parents who send her to a new age hippie school, and though Mr. Lewis obviously didn't seem to think much of it, I rather think it did her some good. Unlike the Pevensie girls, who had a tendency to be ninnies and were very much girls of their time, Jill is a pretty level-headed kid, and neither expects nor receives any particularly special treatment on account of being a girl. She's a real, honest-to-god herione, who takes a--if not the--central role in the proceedings, rather than just sort of standing around observing while the boys do all the important stuff. Girl protagonists, for the win! I love it.Also, I feel it's worth mentioning that Jill using the sort of behaviors, if a bit exaggerated, that annoyed me about Lucy and Susan to trick the giants of Harfang, and with no small amount of disgust, amused me greatly. Maybe Lewis finally got the memo that post-war girls were a different breed.But even though I rather adored Jill, I think my favorite character--not just from this book, but out of the whole series--has to be Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle. God, what a character! In my opinion, he has the most personality of any of Lewis's other characters. I love his upbeat sort of persistent doom and gloom, though that would seem to be an oxymoron, and his bravery and resolve despite his bleak, pessimistic outlook on life. I also loved that he was the only one who kept his head and saved the day through a heroic and selfless act when the witch was trying to enchant them. And I really hope we get to see him again in The Last Battle.The other thing I really enjoyed about The Silver Chair is that it's a Quest story. I mean, who doesn't like a good Quest story? If there's a story where so-and-so goes on a long, harrowing journey to complete a difficult and dangerous task, I am all about it. The only thing I didn't particularly like was that the journey itself didn't last long enough for my tastes, and the final conflict and resolution were a little too easy, but since it's a children's book, I'm willing to handwave those points.Definitely worth a read if you're into fantasy. And overall, if you were going to read just one of the Narnia books, I would recommend this one."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1212796-heather", "userReview": "I'm just going to give a generic opinion of the whole series.We love them.The end.Okay, so maybe I'll tell you that we read them outloud to the kids almost 2 years ago. So they were 5 going on 6 and 2. They all loved them and followed the plot and talked about the characters during their play.We're re-reading them again (now ages 8, 4 and 2) and they're loving them even more than the first time. All I hear, all day long is \"For Narnia\" and then they rush through the house, swords drawn. They have made Reepicheep figures out of pom-poms.

fantastical lands of Narnia, as I have chosen to read the series in chronological rather than publication order.Eustace Stubb and Jill Pole manage to escape the bullies of their own world and enter into the fantastical lands of Narnia. Borne on a lion's breath they descend and discover that the lands are once again in turmoil. Young Prince Rilian is missing and old King Caspian is on his death bed, with no heir to precede him. It is up to the duo, along with the help of Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle, to traverse the strange country, find the missing heir and save Narnia for the doom that could otherwise befall it.Like the other instalments in this series, there was a moralistic and overtly religious edge to the text that jarred with me, as a contemporary reader. That being said, it did not hamper my overall enjoyment of this fantastical and magical tale.The characters were as lovable as always and the journey as transporting and enchanting. Puddleglum's character made for especially charming reading, as his pessimistic disposition managed to instil the opposite emotion in the reader and made this humorous and delightful.There is a simplicity and goodness to these stories, where good can be relied upon to overcome evil and justice is always served. With only one more tale left in the series, I will be sad to say goodbye to this world."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1092580-peter", "userReview": "GoodReads/Amazon management is censoring reviews from the sight of their \"community\".

There are various factors -- one of which is simply that I don't like seeing Narnia come to an end! But the main one is that I don't find Jill, Eustace and Puddleglum that compelling as main characters. Or Rillian, for that matter, even though he's Caspian's son. They're quite realistic and human, and lack the nobility that Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy have, I think. Perhaps too realistic. I want to kick Jill a lot of the time for making excuses and not doing what she knows is right. Nobody else is much better. Puddleglum is an interesting idea for a character, but I don't find him that compelling.It doesn't help that this book is fairly dreary. Snow, stone, cold, giants, underground, sunless seas... there are some beautiful, beautiful sections, like the description of Bism, and little gems about Narnia, like about how serious it is to ask a centaur to stay for the weekend. Overall, though, I find it hard to get into and sympathise with the characters.I do find myself tearing up, even now, at Caspian's death and renewal."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/446509-ann", "userReview": "I felt that The Silver Chair gave better character arcs to the \"son and daughter of Adam and Eve\" than some of the other Narnia books. The focus of the book seemed to be shared between the children, Eustace and Jill, as well as the quest - instead of focusing on the quest alone. Also, the Marsh-wiggle is a well drawn character and pretty unique from Lewis' other personalities in Narnia. Like the other books in the series, this one continues to touch the surface of the adventures and explanations, but I felt it was more complete than some of the other books in the series. Perhaps I'm just getting more used to Lewis' writing style. As always though we are taken to wonderful new places and meet interesting new characters, and visits from old friends are always met with a warm heart. Certain parts were somewhat sad, but most of it was happily addressed at the end. Aslan is always very magnificent!

Way back then, I would probably given The Silver Chair two stars. But only because I was feeling generous and I was still in the halo of The Voyage of the Dawn Treader.Some time in the interim, The Silver Chair moved from the bottom of my ratings to the top. And I do mean the very top. Today I'd give it more than five stars, if I could. Its rise has been steady; modest at first, it eventually came to float in and out of my Top 10 for a while. Now it's a serious contender for the all\u2013time Number 1 spot. What happened to change my views?Well, first of all, I attended a L'Abri conference featuring Jerram Barrs and Wim Rietkirk at the University of Queensland sometime in the early eighties. One of them\u2014I think it was Rietkirk\u2014quoted at length from the scene where Rilian, Puddleglum and the children face off the Green Witch as she strums her enchantment of befuddlement in the Underworld. I can't remember exactly what they said but it changed my appreciation of the whole book. It stopped being one of my least favourite books and began its slow ascendancy.Then came the BBC series with Tom Baker (the fourth Doctor in the Doctor Who television series) as Puddleglum the marshwiggle. Such a respectabiggle portrayal! I liked the series so much, the book again made a jump in my estimation. (I even liked the bit they added with Eustace and the dragon\u2014such a perfect touch!)Then I started to write books of my own. I loved two of the Narnia books, hated two and felt the other three were middling. It was an enormous surprise to me when, as I started to write, I found myself wanting to fill in the 'missing' story set on Ettinsmoor! Until I'd was half way into chapter 1 of Merlin's Wood, I had no idea I thought Narnia was incomplete, let alone that its incompleteness was connected with a story centred on Ettinsmoor. Fortunately good sense prevailed and my story shifted location to another planet entirely! However faint echoes of my flirtation with Ettinsmoor can be still be found throughout the story.As a result of this experience, I realised something deep in my spirit connected with something deep in this story, despite my superficial equivocation about liking it.The huge leap forward came as a result of two books: \nPlanet Narnia\n and Green Suns and Fa\u00ebrie.I love Planet Narnia. I think it\u2019s brilliant, incisive, a stunning work of sheer genius. I also think it\u2019s wrong. In a very subtle way. As much as the difference between the north pole and the north magnetic pole.I was succumbing to the charms of its central premise\u2014that the seven books of the Narnia series are based around the seven medieval planets\u2014when I was brought up short by an obvious error. The Silver Chair is not, in my view, themed around the Moon. It\u2019s themed around giants. In fact 40% of the chapters directly deal with giants or giants\u2019 work. It\u2019s all too easy here to be swayed by the word silver and its ubiquitous association with the moon.However, I believe the silverness of the chair is another of Lewis\u2019 (many) tips of the hat to his friend and colleague, JRR Tolkien. In Green Suns and Fa\u00ebrie, Verlyn Flieger writes of Tolkien\u2019s reworking of a Breton folktale on a variant theme of the Orpheus legend. The Corrigan is a faery woman who sits on a silver chair, rules an underworld and seeks to lure a hero to her dark realm. Sound familiar? The story doesn\u2019t end well for the hero, so Lewis\u2019 variant on a variant is more in line with the happily\u2013ever\u2013after of the medieval poem, \nSir Orfeo\n. (Yep, another Tolkien obsession.) However the general alignment of plot at least as it pertains to the Rilian character suggests to me that  silver  is more to do with Tolkien's description of the Corrigan's chair than any lunar aspect. The Corrigan of course is a fairly obscure denizen of the lands of elfin. No doubt her name reminded Lewis of the Morrighan the war goddess of Ulster, the land of his birth. The Morrighan is said to be the forerunner of the witch queen Morgan le Fay in Arthurian romance. In fact Lewis was seriously tempted to name the White Witch 'Morgan' and not 'Jadis', as early drafts of \nThe Magician's Nephew\n indicate. The inspiration of the Corrigan as a distant relative of the Morrighan is, I think, alluded to in the distant relationship between the witches of the north to Jadis.Jadis has, like Aslan, echoes of Norse naming. (Yeah, I know. Turkish cigarettes called Aslans with pictures of lions on them. Tales of the Arabian Nights with lions, aslans, in them. Yeah, yeah. Gimme a break. For a man self\u2013admittedly \u2018crazed with northern\u2013ness\u2019? When Aslan from Old Norse is god of the land?!) There are several possible translations for Jadis from Old Norse, but I\u2019m inclined to go with ironwood witch\u2013mother. Which probably explains the appearance of Fenris Ulf instead of Maugrim in the American editions: because he too comes from the ironwood.I just don\u2019t get the bizarre tendency of those who write about Lewis to overlook the Old Icelandic language. There are too many allusions to Norse mythology to look south for the answers in my view and see Latin or Turkish in the snow\u2013swirled landscape of Narnia. So, heading north, I will point out that the giants dominate the tale of The Silver Chair, far more than silvery things or watery things or lunar things. And in Norse mythology, the giants are the thurses, the rises and the jotuns; they\u2019re the ettins or eotens from which Tolkien derived the name, ents. Even in Irish folklore, the Red Ettin is a giant of the Jack\u2013and\u2013the\u2013Beanstalk school. Here\u2019s where the name Ettinsmoor comes into its own: it\u2019s the high moorland of the giants. Fits nicely. It\u2019s probably based on the Borders area of Scotland, since the folktale of the giant of the broch of Edinshall (edin being a variant of ettin) is about a rock\u2013throwing game.Now in Norse mythology, gnomes and giants are sometimes confused. Thus, if it\u2019s permissible to add in the chapters about the gnomes to the count of the giants, over 50% of the book are devoted to the big guys. Now the giant planet is not the Moon. It\u2019s Jupiter. Which, in medieval times, was equated to Thor. (Both wield thunderbolts, for the obvious parallel.) We refer to Thor all the time, even though few of us realise it. Thursday is named after this feisty hammer\u2013wielding giant.And herein lies, I think, Lewis\u2019 clever gamesmanship and mastery of words. The Silver Chair is themed around Thursday, not around the Moon. Moreover it\u2019s not a nod to Thor/Jupiter but rather to the thurses of Norse mythology. (Not forgetting thur from old Gaelic is strong.) As it happens, the medieval planets correspond to the Days of the Week. So I believe Michael Ward in \nPlanet Narnia\n was utterly, superlatively, outstandingly right in his overall theory while still being wrong in important specific details. (Because it\u2019s a closed system, one error means there have to be at least two. Another involves \nThe Voyage of the Dawn Treader\n which should be aligned with Wednesday and Woden/Mercury\u2014as clearly attested by the silver sea or lily lake sailed by Reepicheep and which appears in the myth about Mercury.)Now all this cleverness was admirable and wonderful. But it certainly wasn\u2019t enough to catapult The Silver Chair so far up it has come to rival my all\u2013time favourite story.What did it was a study of threshold covenants. As I\u2019ve worked on understanding them and listing the symptoms of them, I realised The Silver Chair is the story par excellence of their nature.Python \u2014 check!Wasteland \u2014 check!Memory issues \u2014 check!Giants out to make a meal of us \u2014 check!Giants on a threshold \u2014 check!Being silenced by the enemy \u2014 check!Ambiguous information \u2014 check!\u2018If\u2019 \u2014 check! Theft of destiny \u2014 check!Name covenant \u2014 check!The Silver Chair could almost be a manual on the tricks and tactics of the Python spirit governing thresholds. Indeed the Lady who lures Prince Rilian from the fountain assumes the form of a monstrous snake at the climax of the story and tries to crush him to death. The heroes find their way underground to rescue Prince Rilian through a giant letter E, suggesting that the Lady was meant to evoke an image of the \u2018Pythoness\u2019 of Delphi, an oracular shrine famed for its navelstone carved with a mysterious E. (Which most probably, according to Plutarch, means if.)It\u2019s been enormously helpful to me as I\u2019ve looked more at threshold covenants. The really interesting aspect of the novel is that it starts with a name covenant. As it should if it\u2019s truly dealing with thresholds. In fact, it begins an evocation of a very particular name covenant. The massive fall of Jill into Narnia at the beginning of the story which ends with a watery splash should remind us of the nursery rhyme, Jack and Jill, and of Lewis\u2019 own nickname: Jack.So, of course, it has giants. Because what else does Jack face in the most enduring fairytale of all about a boy of that name? A giant, of course, at the top of a beanstalk. Lewis had always been fascinated by the foes of his namesake. He wrote passionately of Gawain from \nSir Gawain and the Green Knight\n and the ettins that were blowing after him. The Green Knight of the tale is half\u2013ettin himself, his unnamed wife has a green girdle and appears to be a student of Morgan le Fay. So it is no surprise to find gusts of the great medieval poem, \nSir Gawain and the Green Knight\n, all the way through The Silver Chair. It isn\u2019t far from the Lady of the Green Girdle to the Lady of the Green Kirtle, after all, especially when both of whom are artists of ambiguity and deceit.And if anything is going to make me love a book more, it\u2019s one that owes its inspiration to \nSir Gawain and the Green Knight\n, an especial and particular favourite of mine."}, {"userName": "Neda", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22,

I especially love their adventures in this book because their innocence. While the Pevensies had been the kings and queens, it could be said that Eustace and Jill were nobodies so they somehow more carefree and without much responsibilities and expectations. Jill had never been to Narnia and Eustace had only gone once and in a short time so he hardly more experienced.

Lewis book which suggests that this post might actually be quite long. The reason for this is that C.S. Lewis is one of the most considered writers that I know and when he wrote, and published, a book he never did it by halves. As such we have, like the rest of the Chronicles of Narnia, a book that while it has been written for children, and generally aimed at children (which is impressive for somebody who never had children of his own, though he did have a step son), yet is so deep with meaning and allegory that once I got to the end my mind was literally spinning.\tThere are a couple of reasons why it has taken me so long to get around to reading this book, one of them being that until recently all of my Narnia books where sitting some 700 kilometers away from where I currently am. The other reason was because, foolishly somewhat, I wanted to read it after I saw the movie, but since it has now been seven years since the last movie (Voyage of the Dawntredder) it seems to be less and less likely that this was going to happen. Sure, there seems to always been rumours that the next movie is coming soon, but in the end my urge to actually read this book simply outweighed my desire to wait for the movie. Anyway, more likely than not the movie is going to be such a butchering of the original work that waiting would be pointless.The Classical World\tC.S. Lewis was very familiar with the writings, and the stories, of the Ancient Greeks, and in a way these ideas seem to filter into the Narnia Chronicles. Okay, sure, he was a Christian, and it is very hard to ignore the Christian themes that appear in his books (which is one of the reasons people were put off by the films \u2013 they ceased to focus on the message that Lewis wanted us to hear and simply became another Hollywood fantasy movie), but Lewis (or should I call him Jack, since that is what his friends referred to him as, though his students probably called him Professor Lewis) beautifully wove concepts from the myths of the Greeks into what is in effect a Christian message.\tThe main reason that I was drawn into this book was the idea of the katabasis, or the journey beneath. The idea of the katabasis appears regularly in Greek literature and usually involves the hero traveling into the underworld to either garner information by communing with the dead, or in some cases, such as Orpheus, to bring somebody back to life (and while the story of Orpheus drips with a lot of Christian allegories, this is not the place to explore it). In a way the concept of the katabasis can be a reflection on our own lives, those times of darkness where there seems to be no escape, but results is us coming to understand our own self much better.\tThe other aspect of the katabasis is how they travel into the underworld to rescue somebody. In one way this seems to be an analogy of evangelism \u2013 rescuing somebody from their life of destruction and bring them back into a life of beauty. However, this idea isn\u2019t necessarily just Christian because there are even stories of how people go to great lengths, and plow into such areas of darkness, to save somebody (think of the movies of the Vietnam Vets returning to Vietnam to rescue their brothers in arms).The Journey\tThe Silver Chair has only one character, Scrubb, coming from the previous books, and introduces a new character, Jill Pole. This is intentional because in these books the children who go on the journey to Narnia do so because there is something that they need to learn. In the previous books we are told that there are certain characters that will not be making the journey again, and this is because Narnia has already taught them everything they need to know. However, with Scrubb, we know that when he first arrived in Narnia is was a right ratbag, and while his previous experience did change him, there was more work to be done.\tSo, they arrive in Narnia and have been told that the crown prince have gone missing, and it is their job to go and find them. As such they go on a journey to the frozen north, join a parliament of owls, befreind a Marshwiggle, escape from becoming dinner for Giants, and travel into the underworld in search of the Prince. Not surprisingly they succeed, free the prince from bondage to somebody who could well be the White Witch from the first book (though her identity is never explicitly spelt out), and then return as heroes.Being Good\tOne of the themes in this book is our inability to be able to live a good life. Sure, many of us claim to be good, but the thing is that we, as humans, are always cutting corners, or even forgetting things. Sure, we may not explicitly do bad things, but as the saying goes \u2013 for bad men to succeed good men need do nothing. It is not always what we do but in many cases what we don\u2019t do. Once again this may not be explicit, and it may not be something that we intentionally do, but the thing is as the other saying goes \u2013 the path to hell is paved with good intentions.\tIn the story, Jill is given four explicit commands by Aslan, and she is told not to forget them. However, you can probably guess what happens \u2013 she forgets them, and throughout the book we are left hanging, wandering whether Jill and Edmund\u2019s failure to follow Aslan\u2019s commands will lead to a failure in the mission. In a way it is much like the way we live our lives, stumbling around blind, in part knowing what we should do, and how we should behave, yet never actually meeting the mark.\tThe good news is that no matter how much the children failed to follow Aslan\u2019s commands, there was still always hope, in the way that in our lives there is still always hope no matter how much we fail. This is one of the biggest issues that I see with modern Christianity \u2013 there does not seem to be any room for failure. Churches don\u2019t seem to be places for broken and desperate people to find comfort. In fact churches come across as places for good people, places for people who don\u2019t question but accept, but mostly places for people who fit a certain mould and unless to fit that mould then you have no reason to be there.Faith\tThe thing with Aslan\u2019s commands is that sometimes they don\u2019t make sense. In fact the command may actually fly in the face of reality. In the story the children encounter a knight in the underworld, and the knight seems to be the last person whom they are looking for. They were told by Aslan that the person who calls out his name is a person whom they can trust. However, the knight, for a period every night, must be bound to a chair because he is struck with madness. They are told that they are forbidden to watch, however they managed to sneak into the room while the knight sinks into madness. However, it is during this time that the knight screams out to Aslan and suddenly the children are left with a dilemma \u2013 they are told that the person who calls out Aslan\u2019s name is a person whom they can trust, yet the only person who does that is a man in the throws of madness.\tThis is the thing about faith, trusting something even though all of the evidence flies in the face of it. Mind you, I am not attempting to justify anti-vaxers, or creation scientists here, because I don\u2019t think this is what Lewis is on about. However we think of things that Jesus tells us, such as loving our enemies and turning the other cheek. In these cases evidence suggests that we should respond in kind, to defend ourselves, and that the best form of defense is a good offense. However, as Lewis suggests in other works, to respond to evil with evil only adds to the amount of evil in the world, but to respond to evil with good not only works to blunt the evil in the world, but has the way of actually making it a better place to live.The Illusion\tThis is another thing that Lewis seems to have borrowed from the Ancient Greeks, in particular Plato, but it also has a lot of biblical implications as well. When they are trapped in the underworld, the witch finds them and begins to play an instrument and sings as to how the upper world, and Narnia, are nothing more than illusions. This is something that we face every day in the materialistic world in which we live. The thing is that scientific materialism tells just that the only thing that is real is what we we had see, smell, and touch, or even measure with scientific instruments. Our world claims that the only reality is the reality that we can perceive.\tHowever, Lewis claims otherwise, because there is a greater, spiritual, reality beyond what we can see. He explains this through the reality of the underworld. The thing is that they are trapped down here, and the longer that they are trapped, the more distant the memories of another world disappear. In a sense this is the nature of slavery \u2013 it works by convincing the slave that there is nothing beyond the world in which they live. However, this isn\u2019t just an idea of literal slavery, but can also be the case with economic slavery. The thing with our modern world is that it seeks to enslave us to a system of work, and gets us into debt so that we become enslaved to our work. We are constantly told that having a full time job means that we are secure, and that to leave it is just too risky. Moreso, the higher up the chain we go, the more enslaved we become. In the end that freedom, hope, and energy that we had as youths is slowly drained away by the perceived reality of the situation that we are now in."}, {"userName": "Rebekah Rodda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4123340-rebekah-rodda", "userReview": "A pleasure to read this to my kids.

The seat in question isn't a grand MacGuffin or a legendary artifact; it's just a prop of moderate prominence present in a single scene. If it weren't for the book's heading, I doubt most readers would remember the chair, much less what color it was. And this got me wondering; what would it be like if the rest of The Chronicles of Naria were named in a similar fashion? (i.e. for an somewhat important but potentially forgettable object from the narrative.) Maybe something like this:Book 1: The BellBook 2: The WardrobeBook 3: City of FilthBook 4: Prince CaspianBook 5: King CaspianBook 6: The Silver ChairBook 7: Lion-skin SweaterThe story itself is a muddled heap of religious themes and amusing adventures. The villain is an evil witch who seams to be a mixed metaphor from the book of Genesis; combining elements of Eve and serpent. This witch wants to conquer Narnia for some reason, but she gets less page-time than the other villains in The Chronicles so it's hard to peg her as anything more than a symbol.Our heroine, Jill Pole, is tasked with finding a lost prince who's been enchanted by the witch. Her primary responsibility on this quest is to remember a series of clues, given to her by Aslan himself. She's to recite these clues and know them by heart the way a Catholic might be instructed to memorize prayers. Yet Jill and her companions muff the first three clues and the final clue (regarding the prince's identity) turns out to be a disappointing mystery because the Prince is literally the only man they meet on their journey.But maybe there's a reason Lewis' allegory has a bit of a parody feel this time around, for of all the chronicles The Silver Chair features the most humor. There's a elderly dwarf who mishears everything he's told, a council of silly owls, a kingdom of giants who know just How to Serve Humans and a morose but wise marsh-wiggle (a long-limbed frog-man) named Puddleglum, who fans of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy might recognize as a literary great-uncle of Marvin the robot.So pull up a chair (silver or otherwise) and enjoy a few laughs with the denizens of Narnia.

There are several clear reasons for this in a story about redemption, belief and magical adventure and I shall attempt to explain them to you.I particularly love the plot and characters of The Silver Chair. The idea of a quest to find a missing prince is rather old hat, but the twist Lewis offers on that quest with Aslan providing new character Jill Pole several signs to recognise and remember in the search for this missing prince, is fascinating. Not only is this a perfect metaphor for the concept of belief and faith, but it also serves to provide an interesting dilemma in situations such as when Eustace and Jill decide to go into Castle Harfang due to the cold - rather than follow what the signs truly tell them to do.My favourite character in this novel is Puddleglum the Marsh Wiggle. He is the realistic, yet pessimistically cynical character who always finds something to grumble about. It is the earthy nature to this character that causes him to be so likeable as more than merely a reluctant hero, but as an unlikely hero. Yet in the end he is a true hero in how he sacrifices and does what is right, regardless of the cost.What else can I say about this novel without gushing all about it? I could say little to sway your opinion, other than to express repeatedly that I hold this novel in very high esteem and therefore encourage others to give it a chance (along with this series). There is plenty more depth in these books than many recognise and certainly far more than merely Christian themes and messages.

I used to sit in a closet with the door closed and a flashlight reading my favorite books after reading this series, in hopes that someday a door would open and take me to another realm. Of course, the white witch is my favorite character. I\u2019m always attracted to the bad ones. The Lion, Aslan, is a wonderful character as well, but I have to admit, knowing that he was an analogy for God, changed my view of the story a bit and left me a bit disappointed. He was a bit cheesy. Or maybe typical is a better word. Which is why I almost wish I wouldn\u2019t have known the true meaning of the books until after I read them. In any case, the stories were great, the first one being the best. (You always lose a little of the naivet\u00e9 of the children as they get older) But the movies did them justice as well. Reading them again as an adult, found me a little bored, but still enchanted overall with the series. The next movie is due out soon and I can only hope they will continue to make the movies which were incredible. I highly recommend this series and consider it a classic as well.Note: I've recently started these again with my 5 yr old and we are loving it. I get to see it again through a child's eyes. And this time I haven't told him anything about the analogy to Christianity, however I do point out certain lessons such as forgiveness. (When Aslan has his talk with Edmund) I want him to figure it out on his own. We had a popcorn movie night and watched the movie together curled up under a blanket a few days ago and as I sat there, I thought to myself, this is why I had children.

It's not really Narnia to me."}, {"userName": "Shannon (leaninglights)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10961933-shannon-leaninglights", "userReview": "Actual Rating 4.25 stars -This was one of the only book I never read as a kid from the Narnia series. I really enjoyed it - not as much as others, but once again, CS Lewis pulled me in with a spectacular ending. I never read the rest of Caspian's story, so it was nice to see that all play out."}, {"userName": "Alissa Patrick", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20229277-alissa-patrick", "userReview": "Meh, not my favorite. I didn't like how none of the 4 original children are in this one, although Aslan is as majestic as always. There just wasn't enough adventure for me, although the hard of hearing dwarf was hilarious."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2393718-nick", "userReview": "This book only gets better with rereading!
