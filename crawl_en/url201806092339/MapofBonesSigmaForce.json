Ian Fleming. Sigma is the good guy crew here, led by Grayson Pierce, this book's version of 007, ably assisted by his trustee buddy Monk and the relative newbie Kat. It comes complete with an opening action sequence that introduces the two antagonists. When a cathedral in Cologne is assaulted by a crew using strange technology that leaves all present but one dead, and the take is ancient Magi bones, the Church is alarmed. Sigma is called in. James Rollins - from wikimediaThere is a secret afoot and a highly competitive treasure hunt in which Sigma tries to outpace not only the Dragon Court, a millennia old cult of alchemists and overall bad guys, but their hired team of assassins, the Guild, led by Pierce's personal enemy, the cold-blooded Dragon Lady. Joining Pierce in his attempts to find out who, what and where is Rachel Verona, Vatican Caribinieri and niece to a Vatican big-wig. Raoul, the major bad guy is straight out of central casting, lacking only steel braces. There are plenty of sub-mysteries concerning who is in which side in both the Vatican and Sigma, which adds some spice. Of particular value here are the technology, both real and speculative, and the offered history. A definite plus. Rollins is not the tightest writer in terms of offering reasonable explanations for the twists and turns of the story. Far too often he relies on silliness like \"Gray had memorized the layout of the castle.\" This grows in frequency as we near the end. Another gripe is that the book seems a series of chases and battles with not all that much to connect them for the first 100 pages. That abates a bit thankfully. Rollins offers the mandatory climactic thunderstorm, a reasonable quantity of blood and guts, hints of sexual attraction, a bit of perversion, but focuses on the story and keeps it moving at a hectic pace. Good fun. Leave your disbelief on a hanger somewhere.Rollins's siteI read and reviewed one other Sigma Force Book, #4 - The Judas Strain"}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "4.0 stars. Second in the Sigma Force series (after Sandstorm), I can now see that this is going to be a great series. These books are incredibly quick reads with fast, well thought out plots. Even though they are quick reads, don't think there is no detail as James Rollins is a research fanatic and packs the book with a lot of interesting details from which he extrapolates some of the more \"fantastic\" plot devices. Think \"Tom Clancy\" meets \"Fringe\" with a dash of \"Indiana Jones\" and you will have a good idea what these books are about. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}, {"userName": "Jacqueline", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/888571-jacqueline", "userReview": "Great book! I love James Rollins. He's like a cross between Tom Clancy and Micheal Crichton. Right up my Star Trek/Indiana Jones alley!! I highly recommend his books to anyone who loves any of the aforementioned authors or movies. Basically anyone who is a geek like I am."}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/238286-mike", "userReview": "This is the first book by James Rollins that I was going to read, then I learned that there was a series, so I read the first book, \"Sandstorm\", first and then returned to this. You don't really HAVE to read the first two books in any order I think because there is little that is actually spoiled in Map of Bones, most of the previous book is referred to in passing and is more helpful to having a believable world than anything. Not that the world of Sigma Force is all that believeable, well some of it is, like most of his books Rollins includes a lot of science in this book and most of it seems to stem from real stuff, but usually it's being used in a strange way or in an unbelieveable way that is more attributed to \"action movie logic\" than anything sometimes. Still with all the faults that may exsist for this series one of them is not readability. I love the Sigma Force novels for more than one reason, but the easiest to explain is: They are fun to read. There's a bit of depth with the science stuff. There's a bit of depth with the history stuff, there's fun action adventure moments and it's actually pretty well written. It may not be Shakespeare, but sometimes you don't need Shakespeare. Or you want \"Titus Andronicus\" instead of \"Hamlet\". Both may have fighting and death, but one is about the suffering of man and the other is about (Spoilers for \"Titus Andronicus\") cooking your rivals' children.Uh. That was meant to be a way of saying \"Map Of Bones is a fun read\", but somehow became about Shakesperian cannabalism. I don't know why."}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1193988-natalie", "userReview": "Overall, this book was well written and the author's knowledge of the concepts and history integrated throughout the book is evident. Characters are well developed, but there was one major flaw that I found which affected my perception of Map of Bones. By the time I got to the end, I had no idea what the purpose of the whole adventure was. I couldn't remember what the main characters were looking for. I asked my friend, who recommended this book to me, about whether she knew, and she too couldn't remember what it was! Oh well. Conceptual- great. Maintenance of focus -- eh (less said the better)"}, {"userName": "Fernando Paredes", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8392193-fernando-paredes", "userReview": "What a terrible, incredibly long dribble this is. Many of the people who've rated this book poorly have pointed out the many failings within it.The entire plot is absolutely ridiculous:You have an implausible group of so-called geniuses who also happen to be -supposedly- super agents, James Bond type of guys. They put them through \"fast track PhD programs\" (what in the hell is that anyway, who goes through a \"fast track\" PhD???) so they know anything about everything or something.... and yet they are utterly incompetent all throughout the book. This is where we find the first of the book's many cliches, and to me, the first warning sign: The group is called Sigma Force (because Delta is already taken as a cliche, I guess)Then there's the \"bad guys\" - cartoonish, Dr. Evil type of bad guys, who are nothing but Yet-Another-Ancient-Secret-Society blah blah blah, yadda yadda, complete with an evil plot to rule the world or something. I swear, the main bad guy is a mix of the bad guys from the 60's Batman show, Dr. Evil and Disney villains. The author does a feeble attempt of making the reader hate him for his evilness, but I just rolled my eyes every time he acted \"evil\".Finally there's this \"mysterious white powder\" (m-state gold), as the author refers to it the whole time, which somehow \"the ancients\" discovered and used as a superconductor. They left clues (for who?) that take you to some treasure or other...they hint at \"ancient knowledge\", but never say what or what about. Having the bad guys find this will bring about \"armageddon\" (I kid you not) or \"remaking the world in their image\" - whatever that means. It's all so far fetched and ridiculous that I really couldn't find a reason to wanting the bad guys stopped.In between there's this romance building up between 2 of the characters but the author is so clumsy about it he just builds it up with cheesy phrases and yet more cliches thrown in randomly during the story.The entire book is plagued by even more cliches, comic book style: Characters, plot, motivation for the villains, situations, the romance, the ending, everything is a cliche.Other absurdities abound: the heroes seem to pack just about everything and anything they might need in their \"packs\". Two notable examples: At one point the hero is trapped in a room with metal bars in the windows. He conveniently produces a \"portable jack\" (or something) and separates the bars. Another example, he sets up wireless cameras transmitting video to his laptop. There he installs a USB \"signal booster\" so the video feed can be transmitted elsewhere. All very convenient to the specific need of the moment. Not to mention that he also carries weapons (which he seldom seems to be able to use at all), medical gear etc. These must be HUGE packs, but they only get mentioned any time the heroes pull another convenient gadget out of them.At another point, they go into a cavern, and he tells their team to turn off the lights to conserve battery. What? Are they planning on staying down there for days? The heroes obviously not bring down food and water, so why are they worried about batteries at all?In the same chapter, they conveniently bring down 4 six-packs of Coke. So, again, while they're worried about batteries: I'm thinking they were stupid enough not to bring extra batteries, but hey, let's bring tons of Coke, why don't we!! - most inept group of heroes, if you ask me.This was obviously an attempt by the author to get in on the \"DaVinci Code bandwagon\", along with a scene almost totally ripped off from \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" - the author fails terribly and just manages a \"me too\" story.Cartoonish characters all throughout, implausible premise and cliche packed, tedious plot, boring action scenes makes this an intolerable mess of a book.

Using rape is lazy and stereotypical.3. Everything You Need to Know You Learned Reading The DaVinci Code.

His novels read like \"beach read\" thrillers, but not those you'd feel embarrassed about toting around a public poolside. I'm a fan of fun mystery series like the ones written by Jeffrey Deaver and Harlan Coben, but with Rollins' books, I actually learn something. I also love his author's notes following the texts that recommend many of the sources he used for his stories. I don't imagine it's possible to read a tome on papal history while wearing a bikini, but I don't want to limit my sunshine reads to US Weekly, either.

MUCH BETTER!!!,What a great read! Rollins has taken a great concept, the power of gold powder like that in manna and the ark of the covenant, and developed a fascinating story. The history behind the gold powder and the interest of US Special Ops and the Vatican are all explained in great detail with exceptional references to the historical support for all stated facts and assumptions. The biblical history behind this, much like that in The DVC or A&D, is based on Gnostic gospels which requires some \"faith\" (for lack of a better word), but again, everything is rooted in historical documentation.The characters are all well written with unique personalities that 'feed' off of the other characters. The \"good guys\" are great, showing their shortcomings as well as their positive traits, and the \"bad guys\" are written wonderfully well, exposed to their core for what they are, what they want and what they are willing to do to achieve their goal.A page turner from the start, I finished this book (which is over 500 pages in length) in under a week. I couldn't wait to get home from work each night to climb back in to the story.Rollins balanced between both the protagonist and antagonist standpoints throughout the book to create tension and to set up the finale. Plot twists abound.I have read many reviews that compare this book to \"The Da Vinci Code\" and \"Angels and Demons\". I am a huge Dan Brown fan and I loved The DVC and A&D, but I have to give credit to Rollins; this book was better on all accounts. I would compare this to the work of Steve Berry; historical accuracy balanced with creative license to create a perfect work of fiction/non-fiction.If you like Dan Brown or Steve Berry, books about the templars, historical fiction, or any type of espionage/thriller, then this book is for you.A+.

We all learn history, some in school and some just because we want to learn but to fabricate a story this brilliant from such information requires a special type of talent. James Rollin is an absolute inspiration on that front. The amount of research that went into this book itself is mind boggling and to twist them around into the mould of a thriller. The book is not a boring history lesson but a full on adventure where you have to meet every turn with guns blazing. The plot of this book can be inferred to a certain extent from the title itself \"The Map of Bones\". In fact the entire story begins with a set of bones, not just any bones but the bones of the biblical Magi or more commonly known as the three wise men who came to visit the saviour led there by the a shining star. In the modern day world these bones are kept in a gold sarcophagus in a German cathedral the very theft of which along with brutal mass murder prompts the SIGMA force and the Vatican to investigate further into the motives of this mysterious underground organisation behind it. But what they find are more shocking than they could ever imagine. As the trail left by the bones takes them deeper and deeper into the depths of Gnostic Beliefs in the Christian fate and shocking revelations that may even date back to the time of Alexander the great the SIGMA has more than just the secret organisation to deal with. Fighting for the lives with traitors among their midst SIGMA must manage to come out on top for the fate of the whole world might rest on their shoulders. Being my first SIGMA force novel and with a set of recommendation to its name I was prepared to be blow over. True the book does not disappoint you in the least but there were times I felt totally at loss not being able to comprehend what was being said. For the major part you are able to follow the conversation and understand the story behind it. But at some parts I found the descriptions a bit overwhelming and had to reread a couple of times to get the right picture. Other than this the book is an entertainer that should not be missed."}, {"userName": "Aparnaa thanigai", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5271987-aparnaa-thanigai", "userReview": "it was am electrifying adventure but i would prefer james rollins oracle to this book.though it had many ingenious parts it kind of gets murky where fact and fiction clashes.there are parts where u cannot grasp it or wrap your head around it.but in the upside it is a good book which can keep you occupied.commander gray pierson is ordered by sigma to head to cologne in germany along with his team to investigate the mysterious massacre of mass of people and the archbishop in a cathedral.they are joined by the representatives of vatican The killers haven't come for the church's gold and valuable artwork, but for a priceless treasure secreted within: the preserved bones of the Three Magi who once came to pay homage to a newborn savior. As they flee the carnage they have wrought, they carry a prize that could reshape the world. New to SIGMA, Pierce assembles a crack team of scientific and Special Forces operatives to unravel the mystery of the stolen bones, and together they set out on a twisting trail through a labyrinth of clues and dark revelations that carry them to the sites of the Seven Wonders of the World -- and to the doorstep of the mystical and terrifying Dragon Court. Suddenly Pierce, Verona, and the SIGMA team are the hunted as well as the hunters, forced to use every skill they possess to survive as they follow the bones to the ultimate confrontation between darkness and light -- in a lost place of history where science and religion will unite to unleash a horror not seen since the beginning of time. .and lurking dangers from the gnostic dragon court and budding romance between gray and rachel this is one ROLLER COASTER RIDE that you dont want to miss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1"}, {"userName": "Ithlilian", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4793655-ithlilian", "userReview": "One day I decided to go on a book hunt. I liked Angels and Demons and The DaVinci Code, so I decided to try things that were considered similar. If this book is any indication of the type of books considered similar then I don't think I will be continuing on that quest.We have the tough guy military type and his team of sidekicks, one whom happens to have just the right background to magically be of assistance at crucial moments, the intelligent yet tough love interest, and the know it all type that will be giving the history lessons in the novel. The military type has some back story that I found to be extremely uninteresting, and even though he is the main character I couldn't find much that stood out about his personality. Every character is flat, they are all here to serve their purpose, which is furthering the plot.The plot involves gold, clues, and a secret society. Pretty typical I would say for this type of book, yet I couldn't find myself really caring about the bad guys or the mystery. There isn't much mystery solving here. The characters are led to one place where a character spouts off history and instantly solves the puzzle allowing them to move on to the next location. I never felt a sense of danger even when buildings were being set on fire and people were being tortured. I thought, \"The team has to fight their way out of yet another location, yippee.\" Every single location followed the same script, and there was nothing exciting or unique about this book at all. In three words: formulaic and dull."}, {"userName": "Vince", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5109731-vince", "userReview": "I must preface my review by confessing that I am a sucker for this kind of book. Ancient religious secrets, shadowy societies, action, riddles - I can't get enough. And thus it is no surprise I enjoyed Map of Bones.This is a thrilling read full of likable (if not slightly generic) characters, exciting (if not slightly unrealistic) action, and plenty of plot twists and turns (some more surprising than others). Sure, it's all a little formulaic, but if you enjoy this kind of thriller, you won't mind. It's a great ride despite some bumpy spots.Some of the scientific, historical, and religious context that shrouds the central mystery can be hard to follow at times, but that in no way detracts from the chase. The final chapters tend to be a little heavy on faith, but that's not wholly unexpected in a book of this nature.All in all, Map of Bones is an engrossing read that will appeal to fans of The Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. It's the first book I've read by James Rollins, and I have every intention of checking out more."}, {"userName": "Fransiska Irma", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1122425-fransiska-irma", "userReview": "Buku ini mengingatkan saya dengan Davinci Code, banyak sekali buku-buku serupa yang muncul paska era penerbitan novel dari Dan Brown tersebut.
