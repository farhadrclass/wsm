I would use it in the classroom to remind my students that they should not give up on their dreams. I would use it to teach a lesson about how boys and girls are both capable of anything. Girls can be tough and strong and boys can be creative."}, {"userName": "Diana Thomsen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6981490-diana-thomsen", "userReview": "Oh, it's pretty, I'll grant that, but this book is SO WEIRD!!!

My favorite illustrations are traveling hat, crashing wave, luminous footprints, china teacups, guffaws, thank you, and coral honey. I loved the hard-working mouse!Goldberg's and Gassaway's text uses wonderfully descriptive words, such as steaming, gleamed, luminous, shrieked, guffawed, quivered, greedygut, and clang-a-clanging. Fishing terms used include bait, crustacean, nightcrawler, sea-addled, angling, hooks and dock. This unique, quirky, clever story with rich language and an environmental theme for older picturebook fans should please many, as it did me. Reading it aloud to savor the language is recommended. 4 star rating. For ages 5 to 7.5, fishing, moon, fantasy, tides, and fans of Myla Goldberg, David Gassaway, and Chris Sheban."}, {"userName": "Harrison Yates", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27750528-harrison-yates", "userReview": "Catching the Moon is an interesting story about an old lady who goes fishing every night trying to reel in the moon so she could fix the problem that her community was having with a high tide that comes in at night. The moon and the old lady become friends on the night where the moon is not in the sky each month. During these nights they have tea and talk about different things, such as the problem her community is having. The moon helps the old lady and her community with their issue. This book would be a great read aloud book for a kindergarten through second grade classroom. I would read this class with a lesson about tides and the ocean or about helping others when they are in trouble."}, {"userName": "Linda ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5574951-linda", "userReview": "You\u2019ll need to read and look closely at this story because it has some surprises that aren\u2019t revealed, exactly. One needs to guess, and decide what part is real and what part is magic. There is an old lady who lives by the sea who fishes each night with a mouse on the line, and we find toward the end that she is fishing for the moon. You see, the high tide is wrecking her home, and the neighbors\u2019 homes, too, so the idea is to catch the moon to stop the tide. It\u2019s an unusual book with beautiful illustrations that tell a whimsical story that turns out all right for all concerned."}, {"userName": "Maya", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/287905-maya", "userReview": "this is a charming story about an old woman and her relationship with the moon. And how she tries to help her little village by reigning him in. Really creative and I actually love it, but it's a little conceptual for Miles, who struggled to wrap his head around the fact that the moon affects the tides. At the same time, the illustrations are beautiful and the quirky moments (the moon sitting down for tea) keep him engaged."}, {"userName": "Dani Paiz", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22142484-dani-paiz", "userReview": "A fisher woman only goes out a night and it's discovered she does this to catch the moon to keep high tide away. When the moon finds this out he gives the woman moon beam paint for her house and this keeps the tide away. The book is good for vocabulary and narrative skill. I'd recommend it for ages 1-5."}, {"userName": "Guin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4811817-guin", "userReview": "We read this tonight and while JK was really the only one who sat and listened to it, he really enjoyed the story and talking about it as we read it.
