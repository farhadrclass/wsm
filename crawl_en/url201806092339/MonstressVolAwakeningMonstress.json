Both manga and graphic novel are a form of storytelling materials that required pictures, they may be similar in this regard but they\u2019re actually very distinct from each other. I, as a huge devourer of manga for more than twenty years and counting, rarely impressed by graphic novels or comics, not that they\u2019re inferior, just a matter of taste. There has been one exception: Elric adaptation by Julien Blondel, and now, Monstress by Marjorie Liu and Sana Takeda.Taking place in an Alternate Asia setting and filled with a great story that deals with racism and slavery, Monstress also didn\u2019t neglect the characterizations. Maika Halfwolf, Kippa, and Ren are all fantastic characters. Have you ever wonder how epic steampunk fantasy novels you read would look like in graphic novel? This is as close as you get. If any of you has read the manga Naruto or Claymore, you\u2019ll feel at home here because this seems like a combination of those two, with badass main female character and a monster that resides deep within her.\n\n\u201cThere's more hunger in the world than love.\u201d\n\nHowever, the best part of the book for meis definitely Sana Takeda\u2019s artwork. I am a huge fan of beautiful artworks; doesn\u2019t matter if it\u2019s a book cover, manga, I love all of them. I wish I can tell you how gorgeous the artwork in this book is, but it\u2019s better for me to just show you one sample of how pleasantly detailed it is.This is truly a collaboration to watch out for and something that every fans of graphic novel or fantasy should try. Special thank you to my dear friend Melanie for recommending this piece of art to me."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3030788-melanie", "userReview": "Readalong for the BooktubeSFF Awards which is being hosted by  Adriana from Perpetual Pages, Chelsea from TheReadingOutlaw, Samantha from Novels and Nonsense,  Connor from Connor O'Brien, Elizabeth from Books and Pieces, Kaitlin from Kitty G, Sam  from Thoughts on Tomes, Elena from Elena Reads Books, and Thomas from SFF180!I loved absolutely everything about this graphic novel. To date, it is by far the best graphic novel I have ever read, and even surpasses my love for Saga. I am completely blown away, and will count down the days until Vol. 2 releases (June 6th, 2017).This story follows a seventeen year old girl named Maika, whose story starts out where she is being sold as a slave. The reader will immediately notice that Maika has a very strange tattoo of an eye on her chest, and she is missing an arm. Yet, it becomes very clear very early that Maika is much stronger than what she seems. Maika is struggling to hold in her monster, while also trying to get answers from her past. With the help of an adorable little half-fox and a poet cat, Maika is on a journey to discover herself, her past, and what's truly inside of her, all while she carries a very mysterious and sought after item.In this world there are five races:\u27bdHumans - Like you and me.\u27bdAncients - Immortal, animal-like rulers with an immense amount of power.\u27bdCats - Much like people, can speak and fight, but much more adorable. \u27bdOld Gods - Little to no knowledge of them. \u27bdAreanics - Half-breeds.Also in this world, there are factions at war:\u27bdThe Federation - Humans, who just hate magic users and refuse to let them live and breed. These humans will take Arcanics and make them slaves to do whatever terrible things they wish. \u27bdArcanics - Magic users, who are sort of hybrids of the Ancients. Also, two powerful courts, the Dawn Court and the Dusk Court, have risen up to defend against the Cumaea.\u27bdCumaea - Witch-like people that use Arcanic's body parts to make Lillium.People in this world will use a drug like substance called Lillium for power, regeneration, and in some cases, resurrection. Between the war and the use of this magical substance, this world is also now aware of things much bigger than the Federation and Arcanics.This graphic novel is not only bigger than most bind-ups, but it has significantly more writing than most graphic novels, too! You receive a lot, and I do mean a lot, of information and very quickly. This really worked for me, because it became way more of an immersion, while also reading closer to a book. Yet, I can understand how this would be a different reading experience for some, so I felt the need to bring it up. The story is so brilliant and impactful. I can already tell I'm going to be thinking about this world for such a long time, because this is the type of story that just sticks with you, while festering in your heart. I truly love everything about this. The art was so magnificent and I found myself constantly just staring at some pages in disbelief that a human created it. This art also brought very many tears to my eyes very many times, constantly evoking so much pure emotion from me. On top of having an amazing story, it is the best art I've ever seen in a comic, ever.Trigger warnings for human trafficking, slavery, child brutality, and many other dark themes that are in the violence and gore vein. This is a dark story, and it doesn't shy away from that darkness or its brutality.I loved everything about this graphic novel: the story, the characters, the art, the representation, everything. I honestly cannot see any graphic work ever beating this. I am in awe and my thoughts probably aren't even coherent, but this is something unique and special. Please give this comic series a try if you haven't already. I swear to you with my entire soul, this is nothing short of a masterpiece. This is maybe even a once in a lifetime masterpiece. I never put graphic novels on my \"best of the year\" list, but I think this is the year I make an exception for Monstress.Blog | Twitter | Tumblr | Instagram | Youtube | Twitch"}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Okay I'm only going to put a few pictures because you can all scroll through the other reviewers and see more pictures. I don't like reviewing graphic novels because I never know exactly what to say. This novel is about Maika Halfwolf and she has been trying to find her way for some time. She lost her mother and friends to a war. She lost one of her arms, but she has some kind of powers and she has a symbol on her chest that may or may not be the cause of this . . . This novel is very dark but I still loved it. I mean you have all these people things eating other people things and chopping people things up. There is this one dude that I think is hot in the novel. His name is Corvin D'Oro and I'm not going to show you a picture. Lol So, Maika poses as a slave to get to this one person and then some of the kid/things she is with gets tortured and eaten etc. Maika goes postal and kills a bunch of people, supposedly it only happens when she gets really mad. Then she finds some crazy woman that knew her mother and she kills her and takes a mask that lady has <--- big mistake because, said mask, turns into some demon thing in her stump arm. Yeah, I know, it's cray but it happens. It's totally cool. Well, maybe not because it makes her eat people/things. And she has an ongoing conversation with it at times. Okay, so they argue because she wants it out of her. Meanwhile, the novel goes back and forth from Maika's past to the present. We find out some things and get confused in other things. There are also unicorn horses that you ride. I would love that. There are talking cats with more than one tail! I liked Master Ren that was going around with Maika and the little fox girl named Kippa! Anyway, I thought the story was great, morbid yes, but great! I am looking forward to these novels. And I love Marjorie Liu, I have read some of her books from back in the day!

There's no hiding that the plot is convoluted... at best, and if there was such thing as a CONFUSING ALERT!, I would raise it instantly. Indeed Monstress, Vol. 1: Awakening doesn't burden itself with simple details like chronological order and basic knowledge before throwing you in the meat of the (epic fantasy-like) action. Keyword being : HUH?! And then, there are these cat-ish info-dump pages at the end of every chapter (issue) : Oh my GOSH. MY EYES. Too long, too tiny, too much. However, despite the general confusion and slowness, in the end I'm eager to know where the story will go... especially after THAT. BIG. CLIFF. DAMMIT. Overall, the characters are very interesting and pretty fun to follow : First a kickass heroine... ... teamed-up with an adorable fox girl... Awww <3... a talking cat... ... also, a monster... ... and many complex villains. What more could we want?! See above. Mix everything. You've got your world.Want more details, do you? Alright. What you need to know is that the world is separated into two parts (so far), the Human World (with witches) and the Arcanic World (with old gods, animal-head people). Because differences and greed always win, once upon a time there was a war (of course there was). Finally, because those in power are often morons, they built a wall (of course they did). Oh, and the talking cats somehow achieved the status of wise entities at some point during the History. Don't ask me when, though (info-dumping cat pages, remember?) They even go so far as calling themselves Masters *snorts*As the plot, the world is interesting and complex, yet so very confusing at first.Remarkable. Stunning.

Which is why I have upped the rating.Original review:That was pretty brilliant. I really enjoyed this book but it did take me while to find my bearing in the world created (and, to be perfectly honest, I think I will have to re-read this at some point to really get everything). The authors just trust their readers to stay with them and to be patient while the story unfolds, told partly in flashbacks and never completely. The art by Sana Takeda is absolutely stunning. While the colour palette is mostly muted (as is befitting for a story this dark) there are flashes of colour that are really beautiful and impactful. It's style is different to most graphic novels I have read so far (only the Sandman series by Neil Gaiman is similar in places) and I really enjoyed seeing something so original.I really appreciate how female centric this whole book is. Most of the main characters (both protagonists and antagonists) are women and they all look and behave differently from each other and they are allowed to be flawed (and in some cases evil). I like how this wasn't commented on in-universe but still felt like a deliberate (and feminist!) creative choice. I am absolutely looking forward to reading the next volume and thus am a bit mad at myself for not having waited until closer to the release date of the follow-up.

It's honestly one of the best graphic novels I've ever read, and has some of the most beautiful art I've ever seen.I think I've mentioned in previous reviews that I tend to struggle with visual stories, since I find it harder to connect to/emotionally invest in them. That wasn't the case with Monstress, though\u2014these pages are bursting with fantastic characters, action, and mystery. The main character, Maika Halfwolf, is a teenager caught up in a complex magical war between humans and Arcanics\u2014a race of supernatural beings descended from the offspring of humans and immortal \"Ancients\". As an Arcanic, Maika faces harsh discrimination and cruelty. She and others of her kind are literally sold for parts, given to a cult of witches who take their limbs to extract a highly-coveted substance called lilium.It's a brutal world, and Maika is a ruthless and compelling heroine. Even as she struggles against captivity and discrimination, she also has a deeper internal conflict going on. There's an old, dark, hungry power inside her that she doesn't fully understand and has even less ability to control.A few other things I loved:  \u25aa\ufe0f there's a race of cats that are 100x smarter than everyone else and are basically done with everyone else's bullshit \u25aa\ufe0f a minor f/f relationship between two VERY morally gray ladies \u25aa\ufe0f Kippa, the cutest little fox child my eyes have ever SEENMy only real complaint was that the worldbuilding and plot felt a tad overwhelming/confusing at times\u2014it's super complex, and difficult to convey quickly in this format. By the end of the novel, I felt like I was starting to get a grip on all the different factions and races, so hopefully this won't be as much of an issue in the second volume.

The war wages between humans and immortals; magic users and those who wish to eradicate magic from the earth. Meanwhile, Maika simply wants to keep herself out of harm's way while seeking out the truth of her mysterious past and deceased mother. If I were to rate Monstress just on artwork and character design, it would be off the charts. This is the singular most beautiful graphic novel I've ever seen in my life; in fact, I think it's probably the most beautiful graphic novel that exists. There's a wicked steampunk feel to the character designs and everyone is just so stunningly detailed and fantastic. There were panels in this book that I honestly just wanted to blow up into a poster-sized photo and decorate my entire walls in them, because damn.Unfortunately, I didn't love the story as much as I loved the artwork. There is just so much information being thrown at you right out of the gate, and I had a hard time immersing myself at times. I'm the type of reader who likes slow burns and world-building, so being dropped into a universe with so many systems in place and no explanations for any of them isn't a 5-star reading experience for me. If you don't mind that sort of thing, though, I think Monstress could be the perfect read for you!There are also some content warnings I need to throw out here, like child trafficking and abuse, that were hard to stomach in the context of such a gorgeously detailed graphic novel, so proceed with caution.All in all: did I enjoy the graphic novel? Yes and no. It was beautiful and creative, but I was sorely frustrated by the lack of world-building, so I'd call this a solid 3.5 for me (rounding up for Goodreads' sake).

The comic is amazingly beautiful. I didn\u2019t even know someone could make such otherworldly-beautiful illustrations. It\u2019s a true feast to the eyes.But the reason why I\u2019d wish to read a book adaptation is because there is so much substance in this comic. I\u2019m aware that one is limited in terms of dialog and space when writing for a comic format, so I feel as though the worldbuilding and characters would be even more developed that way. (But I\u2019m not saying this should have been a book series instead, just that it could definitely become one.)I couldn\u2019t possibly summarize the story for you, because to be honest I\u2019m still very confused. I know there was a war, which involved humans and arcanic and witches and other creatures, but now it\u2019s ended and the witches rose in power. The main character was young at that time, but she was still involved in the war. It\u2019s extremely complex. But it\u2019s not complex in a way that is annoying either because nothing is clear or nothing makes sense. No, it\u2019s actually usually easy to understand what is going, we just rarely know why this is happening. But I expect we\u2019ll learn more in the future volumes. I love the story, even if it\u2019s confusing at times. The characters are three-dimensional and\u2026 very intense. The whole thing is intense, from the characters to the atmosphere to the gory scenes to the story itself. Because everything\u2019s so intense, it all feels so real.

My interest was so lukewarm with this one that I do not plan to continue this series. The story and characters are NOT bad by any means, this story in this format just didn't work for me personally. I'd love to see it as a movie or something though!What I liked:-The art.-The main character is fierce and I want to know more about her past and whatever is happening to her currently.-Kippa's loyalty and insight about fear and friendship.-Who run the world? GIRLS!-CATS!What I didn't like:-I have no idea why anything is happening. What IS the mask? Why is it important? What's up with Maika's mom and background? Why are these races at war? Why is there a chart that says there are 5 known types of beings and yet I feel like we've seen at least 20? What are the motivations of anyone? What is happening? Instead of building curiosity, the storytelling just left me frustrated and confused.-The world building. So from above you can tell that I have a lot of questions about this world and story but I felt this needed to be a separate point. I read on the Image website that this story is set in an alternate version of Asia, but NOWHERE in the comic did I pick up on that. There is nothing about this story, other than the use of the word 'human' approximately 3 times and 2 scenes that looked like they were set in ancient Egypt, that hints at this being any version of Earth. If this is Earth, where did all these other beings come from? Where did the magic come from? What was the source of this war?-The storytelling / info dumps. We're thrown right into the thick of things and it's quite like if your first exposure to Marvel is a fight scene from Avengers 2, when you've never even heard of any of these characters before. Who's on what side? Why are they fighting? Why is that guy green? Why do they have powers? Beyond the chaotic introduction, one aspect that further baffled me was the info dumps between chapters. We'd get these one page spreads of a cat telling us the history of the world but this information seemed like too little too late (it explained things that would have been good to know chapters ago!) and it being told this way also felt very out of place, not integrated into the story so it was hard to take in without seeing it in action.-I'm personally not a fan of the type of violence included.

There is a lot of mythology and history you need to savor in order to be fully pulled inside a world that has strong fantasy elements, but also steady steampunk and horror ingredients in the mix. Monstress has a strong characterization within, there is no meaningless sidekicks but each individual has carefully build importance to the overall story. Having such a wide range of different personalities with different histories, it is not always easy to keep up with them. But the effort needing to put into this is very much worth it.

What was she?\nMEET THE CHARACTERS\n\u25c6 Maika: It's not always that you see a character who was so damaged, not only internally, but also physically. Something happened to her arm. It was one of the things that I was so curious to find out. I wanted to know why and how it happened.One thing you should know about Maika was, she doesn't really know who those things either. As we read through the story, we find out things about her, and her past as well.She could come across as a rude at times and untrusting, which she got a good reason too because almost everyone in this story has an agenda. You can feel her pain and her confusion. It really made her a relatable character, in some way.\nTHINGS WORTH MENTIONING\n\u25c6 It was set in an alternative version of AsiaHow often does it happen that a YA book is set in Asia? Not often.\u25c6 Fantastic female heroineMaika really kicked some serious ass in this one. What I really liked about her was she wasn't one to take crap from anyone. She's completely confused about who she is and what she could do, but that doesn't stop her from being a complete badass.\u25c6 The world was rich and uniqueThe world the author creates was pretty believable. Although, I will have to say, the exposition of this world was not my thing. I'd rather understand it through conversations, rather than a cat lecturing kittens every now and then about the events that was happening.\u25c6 The illustrations were so beautifulThe drawings were beautiful. It really looked so good I often get distracted by looking at them instead of reading. The drawings reminded me of animes or mangas.\u25c6 At times, it could get confusingThis graphic novel has shitloads of action. And sometimes, it forgets to explain things. When it does try to explain, it does it in a hurried way, that's when it gets confusing. It dumps so much information in your face in one go, it twists my brain into a pretzel.\u25c6 Diversity of charactersYou get to see different skin colored humans, then there are the monsters, the half-breeds, the ancient ones. There were so many cool and interesting characters.\u25c6 It was bloody.It was definitely a brutal graphic novel. Heads gets smashed and sliced of their bodies. Some of them were pretty unnecessary, but in the end i realized, wars like these are never peaceful.\u25c6It was relevant to our current societyThis graphic novel shows how brutal wars are and how differences often spark these types of events. I know this book is a work of fiction, and in the real world, we don't have people who have wings or fox tails and ears, but the plot of it, the one where each camp tries to overpower each other, is exactly what is happening right now. Wings or no wings, these things happen in the real world. Bombings. Killings. Terrorism attacks. Wars. They are happening right here, right now, and it's terrifying.\u25c6 The endingI actually really liked how volume one ended. It ended in a sort of a cliffhanger, which i usually hate but, it actually worked in this case.\nIF YOU LIKED THIS, YOU'LL PROBABLY LIKE\n\n\nI think these two graphic novels share the same theme. Different races fighting for what each side believes in, even if it meant killing and destroying. Saga is a bit more lighthearted though than Monstress. Monstress dealt more about the darker side of war.\nFINAL THOUGHTS\nThere were a lot of things to like about this book, although personally, it just wasn't for me. I like action, and sometimes, a little bit brutality and gore, this one, had a little bit too much of those. And at times, it feels unnecessary.For me, the uniqueness of the world and the magnificent illustrations were this graphic novel's strength."}, {"userName": "Fables&Wren", "userReviewDate": "Dec 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42780417-fables-wren", "userReview": "WrensReads Review:Recommend by Caleb! This...Whole thing...Was BEAUTIFUL!Like, Sana Takeda.. I tip my hat to you. I found myself lost in the art than the story itself. Not that I didn't love Marjorie M. Liu's story telling and Rus Wooton designs, because I totally did, but the art just was wonderful.This is definitely a high high HIGH fantasy book. I am talking multiple-tailed cats, people who are half some-type of animal, and a different type of world entirely. Maika Halfwolf, our heroine, is suffering from PTSD (she was in a big war and has the scars to prove it [she's missing an arm and I think that's kind of awesome the main girl has that]), and not to mention she has some type of dark energy talking to her and trying to take over her whole being because of some mask. You see, she is set on trying to figure out who she is and her past, including what happened to her mother. She meets a crazy lady, kills her, steals her mask, and then her life is pretty much doomed because of said mask.She runs into a really cute fox-kid (MY FAVORITE) named Kippa and then a two-tailed cat named Master Ren (not to be mistaken for me Wren.. I know it's easy to get us mixed up), and they end up being a big part of her journey.This is a \nvery very morbid book\n. I mean, some beings eat other beings to get power from them. Like it is very morbid and sometimes has very-close-to-naked beings in it as well. So don't read if you are easily squeamish or, I mean, super young. I loved this. I can't wait for the next one.WrensReads | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram"}, {"userName": "David Schaafsma", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/269235-david-schaafsma", "userReview": "A 2016 Goodreads comic of the year nominee, and much deserved, I would say. A couple of my (possibly more comics-experienced) Goodreads friends (males of our species) had not liked this series, so I held back for awhile. And I\u2019m not a huge fantasy reader, and this looks like historical fantasy, which I have even less experience with, though it does look it comes with a side of something like steampunk, which I like. . . and there\u2019s some horror in it, okay, good, then many many other friends liked it and I was in to read it. I can say that since this is the first volume they have privileged action and not backstory in the world-building. The action is pretty frenetic, so they\u2019re hoping you will just go with it and just ignore what the hell Lilium is and so forth. Which I sort of did, though I was kind of confused a lot.What I gather is that there was recently or a while ago a war between humans and animal-hybrids, Arcanics, the surviving members of which are sold as slaves. Cumaea would seem to be the humans\u2014and are they all witch-nuns?--who live off this aforementioned Lilium produced by Arcanics. Whatever that is. Sometimes you don't want to know. Maika is our main kick-ass woman, who has lost an arm. Others seem to have lost limbs, too. It\u2019s pretty brutal, not kid stuff, this story, let me tell ya. Horror, I said. Maika has some dark past; she\u2019s a killer, and dangerous. Is she a monster or monstress? Masks have power here, not exactly sure how yet, but they look cool. All the costumes and the dark intricate artwork from Takeda are great. The feel is a kind of blend of western and eastern (manga) art and sensibility. I think this is finally a great start. I's more violent than I imagined it would be, that's for sure, which is kind of a good thing."}, {"userName": "Caro M.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7951847-caro-m", "userReview": "3 stars rounded up to 4 for amazing graphics.Well, this was interesting. This graphic novel seems to be a bit of everything - somewhat manga, but not really, fantasy in general, but with a tad of history, generally YA in tone, but talking about serious issues such as racism, slavery and torture. Graphic side is beautiful and mind blowing - to the point I wasn't just reading the dialogues and getting through the story pretty fast, as it often happens with graphic novels, but I actually enjoyed looking at characters and steampunk-deco style of art. Sana Takeda did awesomely great job!A bit of fangirling now... There's a talking cat in this story, you guys! A talking Nekomancer double tailed cat!!!! And he's adorable!!!!OK, I'm done fangirling.The story itself reminded me a bit of the Daughter of Smoke & Bone and a bit of the Berserk, Vol. 1 manga - first because of the chimeras and wings and tails and whatnot, second - because of the violence and fantasy world and, well, monsters. It's a bit hurried and messed up in the beginning, it's hard to understand what is going on, but once you get through, it gets much smoother, you just need some, well, patience. I was somewhat surprised by amount of f-bombs, I don't think it was necessary and sometimes it just looked forced.In general - I really like this series and I will be waiting for what happens next with the cat Maika and her friends."}, {"userName": "Bentley \u2605 Bookbastion.net", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7971097-bentley-bookbastion-net", "userReview": "What a vibrant, rich and fully-realized world.

What you see on the cover is what you get, and it's gorgeously and beautifully detailed. It's a very nice book to look at. The story, on the other hand, is not as pretty. The reader is thrown in the deep end with very little background information. Sometimes that can work, but here, I was mostly just confused. It takes three issues to get a clear definition of what an Arcanic is, for example. It makes the first few issues more difficult to get through than they could have been. I also felt like the story was moving too slowly for my tastes. Ultimately, though the art is spectacular, I just couldn't get into the story or the world enough to read more. But the art is well worth a look, and I'd recommend it at least checking it out from the library for that alone."}, {"userName": "Evelina | AvalinahsBooks", "userReviewDate": "Feb 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13716524-evelina-avalinahsbooks", "userReview": "What stunning artwork! A really short read, but I can't wait to see the next one. This part is like a short glimpse into a really mysterious and very different world, but so little is given, it leaves you wishing for more. You'll want to find out how this world works - why do these people look mostly like humans but are not? Why do the real humans dissect, torture and even eat these human-looking characters who talk? Why is the world almost solely made of women? What are the two-tailed talking cats? So many questions, and quite little answers, so it just keeps you impatiently waiting for the next installment.There's also an interesting point in this story. The fact that they call these pseudo-humans animals and eat them makes you wonder - is this a lot different from how we eat animals? If it makes it so fundamentally wrong to eat them if they talk, is it so much less wrong to eat them when they, well, moo and oink? Where's that line between life and consciousness, our right to manipulate it? All good questions."}, {"userName": "Mari", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7013001-mari", "userReview": "I looooved it. The art is fantastic, the characters are intriguing and the world is complex and high-stakes. In going through reviews with lower ratings, there seems to be two general complaints: violence/gore and confusion. I definitely will say that if you are easily offended by violence, this isn't for you. I didn't think anything was overly graphic, personally, but the story itself is dark and contains elements of cannibalism, war and murder. For the second complaint, I already mentioned that the story is complex. If you expect to receive all the answers in the first volume, you'll be sadly disappointed. There are so many lines of the story introduced that remain open by the end. First volumes of graphic novels tend to be exposition-y in general (like pilots of TV shows), but its actual job is to introduce you to world and characters. I think this did an excellent job of weaving in those necessary elements with intrigue and action. I don't often pre-order for anything, but volume 2 of this is a must.Edited to add: I recently saw a thread on Twitter about the fatphobia in Monstress. This was clearly not something I picked up on, but I thought it was worth mentioning and including! It's not a prevailing theme, but rather the depiction of a minor characters. She's the only overweight character featured, she's evil and she's called a pig right before she's brutally murdered. It is definitely not something I would've noticed had it not been pointed out. The work itself is very good in terms of diversity, but it got this one thing wrong, I think, and it was a cheap cliche to use to telegraph villainy."}, {"userName": "maymay\u2740", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49148508-maymay", "userReview": "- Kippa is pure and needs to be wrapped in a blanket 25/7 - The book is fricken messed up- The art is so beautiful, I sometimes forgot the plot and just stare at the artwork - The images will haunt my nightmares forever - So much gore dud, im just a little baby- The plot is interesting, maybe if it didn\u2019t progress into a twisted, disturbing plot, I would have enjoyed it more2.5 stars ?? idk"}], "description": "Set in an alternate matriarchal 1900's Asia, in a richly imagined world of art deco-inflected steam punk, MONSTRESS tells the story of a teenage girl who is struggling to survive the trauma of war, and who shares a mysterious psychic link with a monster of tremendous power, a connection that will transform them both and make them the target of both human and otherworldly powers.
