For every good one I read, I'm stuck wading through five awful ones. Such was the case with this vapid memoir. After leading a charmed life growing up in a Connecticut beach town, going to school in Boston, living with a boyfriend in San Fransico, and backpacking through New Zealand, ad-copywriter Amy Thompson ends up in New York. She loves her job, her friends, her apartment and her easy life. Because she's spent a semester abroad in Paris, and also gone there for vacation, she says YES! when her ad firm recruits her to be the token English-speaking person in their Loius Vuitton Paris offices. Once there, she makes her way through bakeries and chocolate shops, eating.I'm giving this two stars because the concept was appealing -- though the writing spoiled it. The main problem is the self-absorbed narration. It's not so much what she says -- because, hey if that's your life more power to you -- it's how she says it. The book reads like a teenager's diary, not the thoughts of a money-making, successful, 37 year-old woman. It was all me, me, me! Why isn't someone giving me exactly what I want at every given moment?! And when she wasn't whining, she was bragging about how fabulous her life was.The prose isn't up to par with the subject matter -- there's little sense of discovery or wonderment. Each tale of a treat or bakery is no different than the last. You have no sense of where you are or what's important about this tart, or this shop. She doesn't paint the picture. The New York descriptions were a little better. You do get a feel for those streets. Yet, even there, she's disparaging the NY \"Carrie Bradshaw\" wanabes, while failing to realize she sounds just like them: 1) She literally whines when asked to write copy at her Paris job because in NY that was the assistant's job! or 2) She's astounded -- astounded! -- at the fact that there are not thousands of Frenchmen falling all over themselves to ask her out. This cluelessness carried through every aspect of the book. I felt compassion for her when she faced a medical crisis in Paris and was desperate to find an English-speaking doctor. But, alas, in the next paragraph she admitted her own doctor in NY had recommended a prescription for this very issue before she left, but she didn't bother, \"because she had to pack and say goodbye to her friends!!\" Well, hell, it isn't really a medical crisis if it's of your own making.I haven't read anything this self-centered in really long time. And what kills me is it could've been really good!!

I've wanted to go to Paris and love chocolate, so I thought this would be a fun, vicarious read. I couldn't have been more wrong. This book is the most self indulgent, snobby book I have ever read. Really, the biggest existential dilemma you have is whether to stay in Paris or go back to New York? Really? You didn't fill your anti-anxiety prescription because you had other more pressing issues, like packing, to deal with? All that aside, I was lost and confused during the descriptions of this baker in New York and that whatever-the-French-word-in-italics in Paris and how they all lead this grand moment of complete closure. I really liked the book at first, then I kept reading and just when you thought the author couldn't get more detatched from reality she did. I didn't feel as though I got really know the author and had a SUPER hard time feeling any sort of compassion for her and her \"to stay in the most beautiful city ever at a job i love\" or \"to go back home and be in a culture i feel comfortable in\". There is so about that that bugs me I can't even begin. If you're looking for a good brain rot book, this is your ticket. It's complete fluff and no filler. An easy summer beach read that'll make you want to drown yourself."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "Interested in more of my reviews? Visit my blog!*sigh*\u2026 Paris. And pastries. :)What could be better?\u2018I guess it goes to show that you just never know where life will take you. You search for answers. You wonder what it all means. You stumble, and you soar. And, if you\u2019re lucky, you make it to Paris for a while. Here\u2019s what happened when I did.\u2019On top of tales of wonderful sweets, the author shares her own personal story about finding her way in a foreign place, gaining a new perspective on life and simply learning to be thankful for what life dishes out to you. It was quite a delightful surprise that I enjoyed immensely; am so glad that I requested this book. Despite my attempts to read this only on a full stomach, I still ended up with one serious sweet tooth by the end of this book (or even by the end of each chapter\u2026or page). The author describes in extreme detail the sweets she eats, and makes each and every one of them sound positively heavenly. \u2019\u2026her signature pretzel-covered, sea-salted caramel that had crackly, salty pretzel bits coating the 66 percent cocoa shell and creamy caramel center.\u2019Oh\u2026 my\u2026 gosh. Who makes these and how can I buy some of these goodies? Apparently her name is Rachel Zoe Insler, owner of Bespoke Chocolates. I was drooling so heavily over the descriptions I went so far as to try and find her online\u2026 only to find that her business had actually closed earlier this year. I was one seriously sad puppy. (If I had simply kept reading I would have realized the author spoke of the business closure at the end of the chapter haha). At the end of each chapter, she also tells where to find some of the best cupcakes, macarons, truffles, etc. in New York and Paris. Definitely made me want to take note and write down more than a few for when I eventually make it to each city.I found myself using Google Translate often and searching for Frenchie terms that I had no idea the meaning (V\u00e9lib\u2019 is a bicycle sharing system, fish are sold at poissoneries, and there are twenty arrondissements (or districts) of Paris. I think normally this would have irritated me having to stop every few minutes to figure out what exactly I\u2019m reading, but being that I personally have a crush on anything Paris and cannot wait to go there personally someday, having to search for unknown items and words was actually quite a fun experience for me. I also quite enjoyed taking a look at the author\u2019s two blogs Sweet Freak\u00a9 and God, I love Paris. If she didn\u2019t do a good enough job in her book describing all the delicious goodies, the pictures she posts on both blogs are bound to get you. Sure makes this gluten-free girl quite sad (but has me definitely contemplating getting off my butt and at least trying to find and modify recipes for goodies that I can eat too.

It is a very personal memoir that nonetheless doesn't go very deep, by which I mean that Thomas shares some of her conflicts and issues, but at the end of the day we don't understand who she really is any more than when we began. My sneaking suspicion is that she is far from the shallow person this would seem to imply and has chosen to share only so much with us. This is her right, of course, but makes for a less than compelling memoir.Not being as much of a sweet freak as she is (and being one of the few people in the world who doesn't particularly care for chocolate, which Thomas speaks of as a heroin addict does his drug), the frequent digressions into descriptions of deserts, pastries and such became boring to me. But it would be a bit disingenuous of me to complain about this\u2014it is, after all, what the book is about; she makes no bones about that. One thing I do most certainly share with her is a love of Paris and the parts of the book where she celebrates this wonderful city made me nostalgic in a sweet, yearning way.Still and all, this is a delectable confection and not one I would have chosen to pass up.

Although, it was not just for any job. Amy was offered a job working for famed designer, Louis Vuitton. She wrote ad copies. Thus the journey begins for Ms. Thomas. I could tell from this book just how much Ms. Thomas really loved (obsessed) over all things sweet. If I had to name a place to visit to indulge your sweet tooth, than Paris would instantly come to my mind. I am jealous of Ms. Thomas getting to call Paris her home and try out all some of the best pastries, cheeses and breads. Ms. Thomas did a nice job of describing in detail, all the wonderful foods she sampled. As I was reading this book, my mouth was watering. While, I did enjoy reading about Ms. Thomas\u2019s experience in Paris and learning about the different sweets, I also grew tried after a while. It was like Ms. Thomas was repeating herself with every chapter, just that the food item being featured was different. I found myself skimming over the chapters and than finally flash forwarding towards the end of the book. Highlights of this book are the More Sweet Spots on the Map. These were usually inserted at the end of each chapter. Ms. Thomas would than explain a shop, ingredient or something else. I did learn lots from these little features. Finally I have to agree that the Macaroons you can pick up in the grocery stores are \u201cfakes\u201d. They are not the real deal.

But while I enjoyed it, I wasn\u2019t caught up in a Parisian swirl of ecstasy over it.I could relate to the author\u2019s sense of displacement (when she was in Paris, she ached for New York, when she was in NY, she yearned for Paris) and enjoyed some of her descriptions of sweet treats and their locales. But this was where it fell down for me - it was a literary sugar overload - I felt like I was putting on 2 or 3 kilos just reading it!! And after a while, it all became a bit pass\u00e9.It was almost as much about NY cafes and patisseries and bakeries and cupcakeries etc as it was about those in Paris. For people living in or travelling to either NY or Paris, it would be great to look up which of these places are still around.

I don\u2019t know\u2026you tell me. Pin a tail on the genre). The super accessible writing style and charming chocolate addiction of Amy Thomas won me over immediately.It is really ironic that I decided to pick up a copy of Paris, My Sweet at all. I actually spent three days in Paris a few years ago and was less than impressed. Of course, three days didn\u2019t really give the city a fair shake to impress me. All I got to do was the cliched touristy things. But, I was intrigued by Amy Thomas\u2019 background and the mention of chocolate \u2013 so I let myself be lured. I\u2019m oh-so-glad I did!I\u2019ve already used the words charming and enchanting \u2013 but allow me to just go ahead and say them again. Paris, My Sweet is nothing if it is not those things. Foodies: take note. Even if you have less than zero interest in reading a book about a woman living in Paris, this is still a book for you.Chocolate isn\u2019t our author\u2019s only obsession. Seriously! Her orgasmic description of biting into a fresh baguette had me eyeing even my Sara Lee sandwich bread longingly.Also, you will be insanely jealous of Amy Thomas in the first few chapters. From a life she loves in NYC to a dream job in Paris? Yeah. We can all feel free to hate her. On top of all that, she goes and writes an incredibly creative and witty novel. Now you can really hate her. (But then you have to feel bad when her love of two cities causes an identity crisis later in the book and you\u2019re reminded she really is just human\u2026)Following her around the streets of Paris on her rented bicycle is an experience. Her down-to-Earth writing makes her feel like a friend that is showing you around. The things she is interested in (food, beautiful landscapes, people) are things I\u2019m interested in.Paris, My Sweet might be non-fiction, a memoir and a travelogue \u2013 but it felt more like a personal letter. I\u2019m so glad that she is also a blogger! Just another level I can relate to her on.I promise you guys \u2013 you will not regret letting Amy Thomas give you her Parisian tour in Paris, My Sweet.

A \"sweet\" romance, with an endearing scattering of the French language. The sucre freak in me is forever coveting a read such as this. However, almost parallely, she permits the reader to be wholly seduced by the charm Paris so generously renders, as she surrenders to the vivacity & nonchalance of the City of Lights.

I read books, watched movies, participated in blogging events. I am pretty sure I dreamed of Paris. This year, I have managed to back away from that a little bit, which is probably a little more mentally healthy, but I very nearly had a relapse reading this book!This book is the story of blogger turned author Amy Thomas swapping her fabulous life in New York for fabulous life in Paris for a year. Amy has a self confessed sweet tooth and so a lot of the focus on the book is about finding the best French desserts on offer.The food descriptions in this book are fabulous. I was certainly left wishing that I had a cupcake or a cookie, a macaron or one of those delectable little cakes that seem to be popular in Paris by my side as I read through the pages.One of the differences between this book and others, is that not only does Thomas talk about the new experiences that she is having in Paris, she also compares and contrasts those experiences with her New York memories. For example, in one of the early chapters she talks about how cupcakes are crossing the Atlantic from New York to Paris, but also that macarons have made the opposite journey and where to find the best of each in both of those cities.If you had the good fortune to be heading to either city, you could use the author's experiences as a guide to finding some of the best indulgences, especially seeing as there are handy maps and also lists of websites, contact phone numbers, addresses etc for many of the places that were mentioned in both cities.There was a point where I was a little concerned about the direction the narrative was taking when Thomas started lamenting her lack of a love life. Whilst I have no doubt that it was a very real preoccupation, I wasn't sure that I wanted to read yet another I moved to Paris/Tuscany/choose-your-own-destination and had a fabulous life and fell in love with a fantastic guy too! Fortunately, that was a short aberration!One thing that I did think the author did a great job of was in explaining the feelings that come when you are living overseas for an extended period of time. I spent five years living in the UK, and I could totally relate to the feelings of knowing that you were lucky to be able to live where you are, but also wishing you were back at home some times too. And then when you do go back, you miss your life in your new location! It's like you are living in two places, never fully in either one! Even when I returned home, it took about 18 months to feel like I was fully at home again, and then within six months of finally achieving that feeling I ended up moving to a different city in Australia.If you have a sweet tooth, if you want to live vicariously through the eyes of Amy Thomas as she spends time in both Paris and New York, then this may be a good choice for you. She certainly had me wishing that I could spend even just a couple of weeks in Paris exploring some of the culinary highlights!Rating: 4/5"}, {"userName": "Sandie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/146995-sandie", "userReview": "Amy Thomas fell in love with Paris on a trip in her late teens. She dreamed of living there, and after years of work in the advertising field, she was offered a dream job. She could take a contract to work on the advertising of Louis Vuitton, but would have to move to Paris and work there. Amy jumped at the chance as it was her dream come true.Amy's other passion was quality desserts. She had, as a side interest, created a blog about sweets and where to find the best ones in New York. She dreamed about expanding this with all the wonderful new sweet shops and French confections she would find in Paris. Amy spent her first weeks there touring the famous shops and discovering new ones. Paris My Sweet combines both the story of Thomas's two years in Paris and her love of anything sweet. Each chapter talks about an issue common to those starting a new job, moving to a new city, or being a woman on the cusp of middle age who is still single and adventurous but starting to wonder about love, marriage and children. Each chapter also features a category of sweet such as the madeline or cupcakes or macarons. At the end of each chapter is a page outlining the best places to find that category of sweet, both in New York and in Paris.Paris My Sweet will appeal to a wide variety of readers. It is great travel writing. Foodies will be thrilled to read about the variety and intensity of flavors available in the dessert category as well as the guide to the best places to find specific categories. Overall, the book will appear to women working on finding their place in the world, finding that mix of work and family/love that works for them. Throughout the book, Thomas is revealed as a woman questioning her life but ultimately satisfied with her choices, a woman with a zest for life and who loves to share with others.

Along the way, she exposes us to cultural references from the perspective of a single woman leaving the security of her NY friends to embrace a dream. I expected a light hearted tour of Parisian bakeries, confectionaries, and even bistros. As I dined on Thomas\u2019 descriptions of macarons, I realized there is more to this book than just a crispy \u201ccookie\u201d. Thomas\u2019 story is stuffed with a robust cr\u00e8me that represents the challenges she encountered to live her dream. Having lived overseas as single woman, I appreciated Thomas\u2019 humor as she rented a six story walk up, practiced with a French tutor, and found solace in the culinary delights offered by Paris. An obvious comparison is Carrie Bradshaw in SEX IN THE CITY (disclaimer: Thomas does not cross the threshold of spiciness in the fictional series). Both are writers. Both ponder the challenges of \u201clife in the city\u201d. Bradshaw ran off to Paris for an affair with Mikhail Baryshnikov while Thomas moved to Paris to have an affair with its culture. Just as Bradshaw made her life personal to the viewers, Thomas makes her life personal to the reader. I found myself admiring Paris landmarks, riding the V\u00e9lib\u2019 (bike) over cobbled stone streets, and nibbling on luxurious confections. Thomas\u2019 story has universal appeal as she fulfils a fantasy while reality moves forward.Thomas ends each chapter with a list of places to procure the delicacies she referenced in both NYC and Paris.

This isn't really a romance but it is a love letter to Paris and New York and after my first trip to Paris last Fall I've been fantasizing about going back. I LOVED Paris and tried to soak up every second of time while I was there. So when this book came to my attention I just had to read it and I thought I would share it with you even if it isn't my typical book to review. Amy Thomas writes in such a way that even though I spent an idyllic week in Paris, I could so easily see the nuances of the city and the People that were both amazing and that later made her feel lonely. She picked up and conveyed so well those small little things that can throw you off in Paris. For instance, it just felt so alien to me not to smile at everyone I met and walked past on the street. I love Amy's inclusion of instances of how Parisians reacted to her smiling since I had the same experience. But what really drew me to this book, and I think you will love, are the amazing descriptions of the perfect desserts to be had all over Paris and their sometimes up to par counterparts in New York. You can read Amy's love of fine pastry and the work that goes into each small bite on every page. I mean this is the ultimate guide to eating in Paris (and New York) and you can bet I'll be using this as my sweet tooth guide the next time the hubby and I make it to Paris.

I was expecting it to be a younger woman's tale and was somewhat surprised to find it the story of a woman in her mid-thirties. Maybe I am just old but her seeming so lost at that age did not resonate with me; I had been married for 14 years by this age and well settled into my career although about to get the health shock that would alter my life in unimaginable ways. The stories were very personal and I do commend Ms. Thomas for putting herself out there like that. I, too, love Paris and would love to return some day. I also love sweets but prefer to make them myself but I have found myself struck dumb by the beauty of the creations in a fine patisserie. But looks can be deceiving and sometimes this book fails to deliver - at least it did for me. It became a bit repetitious and seemed to be a series of essays loosely strung together with an overlay of spun sugar binding them together. Each chapter is written around a specific treat and her observations of her life and trials at that time are tied to that treat. It gets old after the first few treats - as too much sugar will.Perhaps this is a book best read a snippet at a time so each cookie, cake or cup of hot chocolate can be savored for itself rather than gorging on every sugary sweet under the sun.

In this case, you never really see anything because the writer is always in front of you shouting, \"Look at moi\"."}, {"userName": "Beth Knight", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/688928-beth-knight", "userReview": "A fun book for when an escape from reality is needed!

Her whole life, Amy has always been intrigued with the city\u2019s people, style, and culture. Then, when she gets offered a job to work for Louis Vuitton in Paris, France, she is ecstatic to have the opportunity. However, throughout her journey, there are some bumps in the road. To name just a few, there is a severe language barrier between her and all those she meets, so she is having a very difficult time making friends. In addition, she is away from all of her friends and family back home, so she often feels a strong sense of loneliness. Although there are some down sides to living in a whole new continent, Amy does try to make the best of it and enjoy her experience. She is a self-proclaimed \u201csweet-freak\u201d and has her own blog where she dishes about the newest bakeries and the hottest sweets to try. So, in each chapter, you learn about a new pastry Amy tried while in Paris, how it\u2019s made and where the best place to get it is. The in depth look at French culture is fascinating to learn about in Amy Thomas\u2019 whirlwind story that is Paris My Sweet. There is no definite plot in the memoir, Paris My Sweet so, in my experience, it took me a while to find something that appealed to my interest. But, in chapter 12 (the second to last chapter of the book) Thomas wrote something that really made me think. She was out to dinner with a couple of her new Parisian friends when she asked the question, \u201cDo you believe in fate?\u201d(240). From this, a whole debate began about whether or not fate truly exists. Everyone had a different opinion. Some thought that fate couldn\u2019t possibly exist because if it did, we wouldn\u2019t have any control over what was happening in our life, while others thought your instant connections with people you had just met or the concept of being in the right place at the right time aren\u2019t under your control; that some higher power has to have to do with these life-changing events. As I read the whole conversation, I really started to question if fate is existent. All the opinions I was hearing were resonating with me and spoke to me all in a different way. Do we really have control over what happens in our lives or is everything already planned out for us and we\u2019re just riding the wave? When I chose this book to read, I didn\u2019t think that it would become this deep and thought-provoking; but it was, and I\u2019m glad it did, because it really pulled me back in when I was becoming bored with the rest of the events.Overall, with the exception of Chapter 12, I wasn\u2019t too impressed with Paris My Sweet. I realized that I need a book with a plot line, and this just didn\u2019t fit the bill. It wasn\u2019t going anywhere, and to be honest, the ending was quite pathetic. However, Paris My Sweet wasn\u2019t all bad. I truly did enjoy the little inserted French vocabulary here and there and tips of where to go if you\u2019re ever looking for a bakery in Paris. That is why I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in French culture. Although a memoir, I would consider \u201cParis My Sweet\u201d to be more of a travel guide to France and less of an intriguing look into the life of an American in Paris. This is what I was expecting but didn\u2019t get. The \u201ctravel guide\u201d portion, I did appreciate and was interested to read. If you\u2019re like me, and want to visit Paris someday it is exciting and helpful to see what the city is really like. But, the actual \u201cmemoir\u201d portion didn\u2019t live up to my expectations. Thomas mostly complained about how she couldn\u2019t find a boyfriend or fit in anywhere. It got exhausting and frankly, extremely annoying. So, if you are looking for a book that has a plot line and actually goes somewhere in the end, this is not the book for you, but if you are looking for an in depth look at the French culture and tips of where go, this would be an amazing guide to keep in your back pocket. All in all, I have to say that the memoir, Paris My Sweet by Amy Thomas did make my mouth water, but didn\u2019t touch my heart."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4357686-kate", "userReview": "Reading this memoir, it\u2019s easy to fall in love with Paris as Amy Thomas sees it. She has a way of describing food not just as the fuel the body needs to survive but rather as something to be savoured and revered.As a lover of all things sweet and a desire to travel all over the world, at times it felt like this book was speaking directly to me. Amy Thomas, a thirty-five year old career woman who enjoys the single life in New York City gets the opportunity to live in Paris for a year. With the help of a V\u00e9lib, Amy travels all over Paris and experiences all the chocolate shops, bakeries and pastry stores that the City of Light has to offer. This book is part memoir, part guidebook. At the end of each chapter Thomas gives a brief selection of venues in both New York City and Paris that offer some of the delicacies mentioned previously in the chapter. There are a lot of French terms mentioned in story. I was over eager and looked up what they meant only to find a definition of sorts in the next paragraph. Whilst some may say there was too many foreign terms, I appreciated the chance to indulge my inquisitive side and felt better educated by the end of it. D\u2019accord?Amy as a narrator is fantastic. She\u2019s romantic and shows Paris off in a way that you the reader can tell it\u2019s a place she treasures. The beauty of the food and the city are written about with such passion and detail that I could almost believe I\u2019d been there. At the same time, she doesn\u2019t gloss over the negatives \u2013 like the pigeons and the unsmiling locals. She describes it in it\u2019s whole. I also liked her attitude towards life \u2013 she\u2019s practical and doesn\u2019t take her situation for granted. I love how brave she was to take this chance and I also adored that despite the indulgence of the food, she doesn\u2019t take it for granted.Whilst reading this book I kept going online and sneaking peeks at Thomas\u2019 blog, SweetFreak. Between the pictures there and the way the chocolates, cupcakes and other delicious morsels were written about, I was in food heaven. It\u2019s a good thing that window shopping (so to speak) is fat-free. It was enough to both make me extremely hungry and at the same time dissatisfied with all the food options I had in my house. I was craving a Pain au chocolat from Paris, a banana cupcake from New York or another of other sweets that I\u2019d just read about.If I lived in New York or Paris (or was planning a trip to either city in the future) I\u2019d be including at least one or two of the stores Amy Thomas wrote about!"}, {"userName": "Molly Jean", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5055367-molly-jean", "userReview": "This book is as light and airy as the French pastries the author writes about. I don't know how anyone could expect it to be anything else. It was a very enjoyable romp through not one, but two great cities, equally famous for their cuisines and ways of life. Although the author is about the same age as Elizabeth Gilbert and is undergoing a certain amount of soul searching, I thought this book was also nearly (and blessedly)completely free of the self indulgent BS and whining so heavily ladled out in \"Eat, Pray, Love\". Bottom line: I like Amy Thomas. I would love to split a chocolate chip cookie with her, in either Paris or New York. Split a bowl of pasta with Elizabeth Gilbert? No way.However, I have one rather significant nit to pick with the author and that is her all-too-frequent use of the term \"Frenchie\"...it was like fingernails on a blackboard...am I the only Goodreads reader who was annoyed by this? Although not textbook derogatory (certainly not as bad as \"Frog\"), it is borderline dismissive to my old ears and certainly not very respectful. Just call them the French, or a Frenchman or a Frenchwoman. But please, for an author who professes to love almost everything French, I would think she could have come up with a less childish and more grownup moniker to refer to the very people who created the culture, cuisine and city she loves. So Amy, please knock it off. It annoyed me so much I am taking my rating down one star from three to two.

(The closest I got was the Charles DeGaulle Airport.) I was able to over look this line: \"...but it wasn't long before we became inseparable and I got to learn more key traits from my corn-fed friend from Iowa.\" Was it necessary to add that bit about corn??? I realize it's a book about food, but still it annoyed me. When I got to this line when she talks about her parents traveling to Europe for the first time to visit her and her brother: And being devotees of the Fox News channel, I knew leaving U.S. soil for the first time (especially for France, Zut Alors!) made them more then a little anxious. I'm not a fan of that channel, but my parents watch it and I have on occasion. It just bothered me that the author threw that remark in. Why blame a news channel for them feeling anxious? Why not just say they were anxious about leaving the country? The descriptions of the bakeries and chocolate shops were wonderful, and I can tell that the author really has a joy for all things sweet. I loved seeing her struggle to adjust to life in Paris, and her descriptions of New York City. Both of my sisters have lived in NYC (the village and Tribecca) and adored it, so I loved seeing the city in a different way.

What's not to love about Paris? Or at least the idea of Paris? This book is everything I hoped Julie & Julia would be (but wasn't) and more. I loved all the descriptions of the wonderful sweets and it definitely created a lot of cravings in my life during the month or so I read this book. Not good for my waistline. The great thing about this book is that it is so much more than just about the food. You care about Thomas during her two years in a new country and at a new job.

I am fully aware from reading the reviews that for sweet lovers this book is like a bible and brought those readers into a dreamy world filled with all things chocolaty. I sadly just wanted to go to Paris for a bit. I was hoping Amy wold bring me into her new world filled with beautiful descriptions of the magical city she now found herself in.

I know this author is essentially a travel/fluff piece writer for a host of publications, but her descriptions of places, foods, desserts all started to run together after a while. Maybe that's the trouble you run in to with a book that's half memoir, half dessert review. I don't mean to knock it completely- it did inspire me to make my first ever batch of macarons (fugly, but delicious), and I love adding awesome places to my list of sweet stops in New York, even Paris- but it's funny, I initially thought I had about twenty pages left in the book that I'd save for another day only to realize on said day that I HAD finished the book and what remained were yet more reviews; there was just no sort of cohesive ending, and a greater portion of the book lacked a well planned track. There were also times when the author kind of irked me- for example, the description of a colleague's wife as a \"large and lovely Mexican,\" as if the tool of alliteration made it less douchey- but then she'd come back with a genuine endorsement of the tastiness of some random mass produced American processed snack food, and I'd have to give her props for not being a food snob."}], "description": "Part love letter to New York, part love letter to Paris, and total devotion to all things sweet.
