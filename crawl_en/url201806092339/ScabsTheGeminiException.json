Shelman's novel are twin brothers Scott and Warren Walsh. After being separated by a divorce they've grown up and started their own adult lives, and are well adjusted, reasonably happy men when the book starts. They share a hobby for messenger pigeons (it helps them stay in touch over long distances), which becomes a crucial part of the story's plot.The book begins with a bizarre period of intense, smothering white light that permeates the world. Everything for no discernible reason becomes illuminated by an indirect, otherworldly light. It kills shadows, mutes the night and causes tremendous disruption to the world. At the same time people who are injured stop healing.Like, any injury will no longer heal. You're stuck with it for life, which as we find out for most, won't be much time at all.When the light suddenly disappears those who are hurt begin to have their wounds scab over. But the scabs quickly get out of hand, covering their entire bodies like a terrible growth, encasing them in a chrysalis that they emerge from as monsters. Mutations of the highest degree become the rule of the day, and when they are set free from their prisons, they seek out anything still human to feed, and to destroy. The only people spared this fate are twins, leaving Warren and Scott to protect their families, and seek out answers and safety.First off, Eric's narration of his own novel is fantastic. His production values are on par with the finest studio productions, and his voice (voices really, as he bounces around with different accents and cadences) is easy to listen to. I can easily say this is a top three audiobook that was read by the author. Kudos to him for a wonderful job.Story-wise Scab's greatest strength lies in the intense, slow burn reveal of the apocalypse. It's a simmering story that unfolds one tiny revelation at a time, building and building the impending terror until it's unleashed in its full horror in the third act. Oddly for me, I thought the huge reveal of the full terror would be the highlight of the story but I was wrong. The build up turned out to be the most satisfying part of the story, and one I think others will enjoy in the same way.Scabs features a reasonable cast of characters that isn't overwhelmingly large, but also well varied, as well as a good amount of action, and a bucketload of proper apocalyptic tension. Scabs: The Gemini Exception is a very welcome addition to the science fiction genre, and a must read for fans of Robert McCammon or the like.Audiobook was provided for review by the Author."}, {"userName": "BookLoversLife", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4020075-bookloverslife", "userReview": "This was such a unique and engrossing read, that it was really hard to put down! I wasn't sure what to expect when I started this, but I wasn't expecting to like it as much as I did. Plot wise, it was slow to start but still kind of gripping. Twin brothers, Scott and Warren live miles apart but have a passion for carrier pigeons, and that's how they communicate. So when a weird light appears suddenly infusing everyone and everything with it, they know something isn't right. Both decide that they need to meet up and try to survive this strange new world. It only get's worse, however, when people stop healing! From the littlest to the largest wound, nobody can heal. Many people lose their lives but those that don't have a wound they can't heal, that is until, the light goes away! Then people with injuries start scabing over, but it doesn't stop there, the scab keeps going until it encases the person totally. People are freaking out and trying not to get the slightest touch. Eventually, the scabs start opening and what comes out is a thing of nightmares! Can the brothers reunite?So ya, this was such a unique post apocalyptic read. I really enjoyed the plot, I really liked the characters, which there weren't many of!! I really liked the idea of the twins being immune to the scabs. I even really enjoyed the fact that the narrator was the author himself. So overall I truly enjoyed this, so why not 5 stars?? Well, I think I found that something was missing from it. I'm not too sure what, but something stopped me from not loving this! Maybe it was the fact that I didn't really connect with one of the brothers. I found him to be self absorbed and not really nice! Anyway, this is a unique and thrilling read and I will definitely check out more by this author. As for the narration. I usually shy away from authors reading their own work as most of the time they fail, but Eric A. Shelman did a really good job!! He had enough tones for his characters though I did find that the brothers sounded the same at times. He was easy enough to listen to and was clear and concise. *I received a copy of this for review.

Eric A Shelman has done it again. I love his zombie books but with not a zombie in sight I really loved this one. It is fast paced yet you still get to see the characters develop as the story continues. You go through a series of emotions and I even cried a few times while reading this as you care about the people as the horror spreads. I really hope there will be a sequel to this story as I want to read how the surviving people are doing.

Not perpetual light like you get in Alaska. Just light all the time, non-stop coming from everywhere. You can't escape it. The light seems to come from everywhere and nowhere. The entire planet is in total panic. The worlds greatest minds are lost to explain this phenomenon. To make it all worse, 98% of the population of the world develop goosebumps. The bumps just appear to be normal goosebumps but they won't go away.Then just as soon as it started, the light vanishes along with the bumps. However, the people that had the bumps now have white pinpricks all over their skin.This is when the real trouble starts. Everyone who got the bumps are in danger. ANY damage to the skin; a scrap, a cut, even a mosquito bite leads to a scab forming. A scab that keeps forming and eventually encompasses the entire body. The victims become so encased they start to resemble cocoons. Doctors are lost, they cannot figure out what is going on. The people seem to still be alive inside the scab cocoons.What is going on with these people? What was that light? What were the bumps? Why is it that only some of the world's population remains unaffected?I loved this story. Its not your typical horror, sci-fi monsterish story. The light is still a mystery to me. I am currently diving into the next book because I have been kept in suspense. Most of my questions have been answered but the light and the bumps are still a mystery. Another reason I love this story is because the characters are so relate-able. Scott and Warren are brothers who were not affected by the phenomenon. They are now in a life or death struggle to reunite after a messy divorce separated them when they were kids. The way Eric wrote this book keeps you hooked and wanting the characters to succeed. While he does this in a way that does not take away from the suspense of the story. This story easily earned a 5 star review.I actually listened to the audiobook version of this story. I think this really brought the characters to life. I have listened to over 100 different audiobooks and never have heard of an author reading the book himself. Eric did and it was amazing. He nailed all of the characters voices and personalities. I always wondered how the narrators managed to get the characters exactly how the author intended. Eric cut the middle man out and I think that brought a whole new dynamic to the characters that made them even more relate-able."}, {"userName": "Cynthia Terrones ", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53520723-cynthia-terrones", "userReview": "MY FIRST ERIC A.

One with love, the other with indifference, they still manage to stay in touch with the other over the years, through the good times and bad.

Warren went with their mom, and struggled but was loved and cared for. Scott went with their dad, and was abused both physically and mentally until he left home at an early age. Now, Scott lives on the Canadian side of Niagara Falls wasting his life on booze and various drugs and Warren lives in Florida close to his mother.The one thing the boys have always kept from childhood is their homing pigeons. Good thing, too, after the light comes...and then the scabs. Now Scott has to get his act together and keep himself and the few others he finds as well as his pigeons alive long enough to reunite with his mother and brother and the few others they find in their old cabin in the North Carolina woods. They figure it's their best chance for survival. What they don't know is why only twins aren't affected and turn into scabs. But the government wants them and now they have to dodge police and the scabs.This book had some unbelievable circumstances to me and that detracted from the story. I found it incomprehensible that any judge would split up brother, and especially not twins. And the fact that Scott was so abused made it even more unbelievable that his mother would not be able to get custody back. And his father is out on a rig for periods of time? Even more unbelievable. And Warren thinking about saying no to his brother when the outbreak happens...c'mon!! But the rest of the story was really good. I liked the way it flipped back and forth between telling the story from Warren's and then Scott's perspective.The narration was really top notch in this narration. Shelman does a fantastic Canadian accent for Scott and something of a southern accent for his mom. The only voice I struggled with was the armored truck driver from Louisiana. It wasn't good. I look for books by Eric Shelman and this one is his best performance yet for me.I received this audiobook for free through Audiobook Boom! in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Deedra", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/746417-deedra", "userReview": "This book took a time or three for me to read it.I don't know what was the hold up but this try I could not put it down!There is a flash of light that brings strange creatures that leaves scabs on people and they turn into monsters.The only ones who can fight this are Identical Twins.This story is how they fight the monsters and become a tight unit to survive.I was provided this book by the author or publisher for review."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3638128-mary", "userReview": "One word: wowI bought the book, then discovered all three on Audible.

I will admit it I actually slept with the light on after I finished. Yes I admit it I was so creeped out and I loved it . This is the first book in a long time that actually made me uneasy. Which in my book is and awesome read. The author has taken us on such a terror filled ride, you will be turning pages all night long. The story is based on Warren and Scott Walsh, brothers that were separated when they were young . One moving across the border to Canada and the other moving to Florida. Not speaking very much through out the years as the circumstances are so vast. As the world starts to change with the light and the scabs . They decide that they have to get to the remote cabin where they grew up. Communicating through homing pigeons and spotty cell service. They have to navigate the government, the hazards on the road and the creatures. Which one is worse I just don't know .  The characters are well written and well developed . You get to feel the pain and anger from both men as they travel to the cabin. They have both been through a lot one more then the other. But both Scott and Warren have been hurt in so many different ways . You see them come to terms with what has happened as they reunite at the Cabin. The rest of the cast of characters are a rag tag bunch that are all twins or triplets . They come from all walks of life and some are very flawed but sweet and others are stronger and want to do anything they can to get away. The one thing is that they compliment each other in so many ways. They become a family as they fight to survive. I really like these characters very much. The author takes us on a rollercoaster ride from the very first pages. The author writes alternating stories so you feel like you are there with the brothers as they head out and fight the creatures, which we don't really know what they are but they are creepy and evolving with every turn of the page. This isn't a book for the faint of heart , trust me on this one . I slept with the light on for 2 nights after reading. and jumping at every noise you hear outside. So if you want a book that combines both zombies and horror , this is the book for you. You won't be able to put it down . Just remember to sleep with the lights on.

Each gave a brief synopsis of their lives leading up to THE EVENT; a light that encases the Earth for 16 days. No one knows why or where it is coming from, the best minds in the world have no answers and while there is uncertainty apart from the constant light there appears to be no dangerous effects other than people getting goosebumps. After the light goes out and normal hours of night and day return things are back to normal. Until something strange begins to happen; a small cut, bruise, mosquito bite anything that will cause a break in the skin scabs and begins to grow. There is no way to stop the them or cut them off as the scabs quickly repair and regrow until the person is encased in a cocoon of scabs. Again no one knows what is happening other than the person is alive inside. There is nowhere to go, run or hide as more and more people fall to the scabs. But the government has learned that .02 percent of the population or Identical siblings are immune to the scabs and are trying to collect them before time runs out. Twin brothers Warren and Scott, one living in Toronto Canada and the other in Florida have also figured out their immunity factor and have no intention of allowing themselves to be imprisoned and made test subjects. And having already witnessed what is inside the Scab cocoon realize they must leave the populated areas before more break open. With communications breaking down, they have a unique way of staying in touch with each other and quickly formulate a plan to return to their childhood home in the woods of North Carolina hoping to live in relative safety. But they must evade their respective governments and the creatures. The trip for both brothers are frightening and exhausting with each night bringing new surprises as they soon realize the creatures are adapting to their surroundings! I purposely left out a description of the creatures because you have to read it to understand then wrap your mind around that- it will scare the hell out of you!! I have no idea where the premise for the story line came from other than Eric Shelman's twisted mind but it is great and easily the best horror book I've read in years"}, {"userName": "Denise Keef", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7004267-denise-keef", "userReview": "Every once in a while I come across a book that so totally engrosses me that life slips away as I lose myself in the pages of it.

I started again early the next day because this book was on my mind and I had to see what happened next! By Monday I had finished. This is by no means a short book. It is 341 pages of sheer terror and horror that kept me on the edge of my seat, cringing, my foot shaking, my heart beating a mile a minute with so many OH NO\u2019s and Nooooo\u2019s!!! It is a story of survival, trust, friendship, family and monsters. Monsters that will stop at nothing to feed! With a well-developed cast of characters that I came to love very quickly, this story moves along quite quickly with the survivors trying to get to a safe haven and trying to figure out what had happened and also how to stop it. Mr. Shelman has created such an amazing story, with so much graphic detail, that you will see each terrorizing scene in your mind and wish you hadn\u2019t!

They are totally real and have their faults as we all do. The story is told from both of their perspectives and we really get to know both of them. The pace of this book is great. It is never too slow or too fast. I found myself flying through the book. The concepts behind the scabs and what people become is fascinating and scary. These are the coolest monsters I have ever encountered. Also it is cool that the monsters have some weaknesses as well so not all hope is lost. The causes of the scabs is one of the coolest concepts I've read and I continue to think about them. Overall this is a fantastic book with great characters, action and concepts.

This book is AMAZING! It was so refreshing to read a book with a totally different world ending/changing event.

I can hardly wait to read the second book. I have luckily found another author with a lot of great books to get lost in. You won't be sorry to try any of his books. I found out I was reading his \"Dead Hunger\" series at the same time. It is just as good as scabs and I kept going back and forth between each book because they were both so good. Then I noticed they were written by the same author. I can't say I'm surprised because they were both hard to put down."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7314984-karen", "userReview": "This being a new author to me i was quite pleased with his writing style and will be adding him to my TBR list.I absolutely loved this book.I found myself engrossed in the story from the first chapter.My one problem with the story was the reason for the twins being separated and unable to communicate when their parents divorced.Yet this in no way detracted from my overall enjoyment of this book.The author is extremely talented at creating well developed characters i care about.I liked that the author included flawed,yet likable characters in the story which make them easily relatable to the reader.The narrator did a great job and has a pleasant voice to listen too.This is extremely important to my overall enjoyment of an audiobook.I highly recommend this book to any fan of the Sci-Fi and post apocalyptic genres.I received an audiobook from the author in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "Quite the unique tale; haven't come across this version of infected before. A mysterious bright light encompasses the world for two weeks then just as suddenly disappears. The only apparent consequence was a full coverage case of \"goose bumps\". Daily life seemed to return to normal with no explanation or understanding of what the white light was or where it came from. That is until people started showing up in emergency with growing/expanding scabs covering broken skin injuries. The scab continued expanding until it covered the entire body including the head, which took about five days for the process to complete. People continued to survive within that cocoon. The question was, what was going on inside that cocoon? As it turns out, identical twins were immune from all these ill-effects. Why? Who knows. Many questions left to be answered."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31528104-jeanette", "userReview": "Aliens...I have read this book before but upon seeing there is a sequel, I wanted to reread. It is still just as good.I like the premise of twins being immune to the cocoons of these creatures. It all started with the the days of light and goose bumps. After normailty returned, goose bumps disappear leaving little white spots which begin to cocoon the whole body. And after cocooning,you really don't want to know what's inside.Now we have a set of twins and their mother coming from different directions trying to make it to a cabin in n.c. for safety. The characters are solid. The storyline is intriguing, the action is jam packed.Oh, almost forgot the homing pigeons. They're in here too.Ok, on to the sequel...good reading ahead."}, {"userName": "Julie Greig", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31928904-julie-greig", "userReview": "This is a new direction for the author and I'm terribly glad.The style is fresh; crisp writing with characters that soon become real people that make you laugh and cry right along with them.The technical, geological, weaponry information is up to the usual standard.Without any spoilers this is an excellent piece of terrifying storytelling, Shelman at his best.If you deny yourself joining him in his latest adventure are doing yourself a serious disservice.If you are into well written, tight storylines with a bit of horror mixed with sci-fi, with great people you should treat yourself to this book, you will not regret it"}, {"userName": "John Robinson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18014632-john-robinson", "userReview": "Scabs ...I have been reading the dead hunger series for a couple years and I really enjoyed them ...

The story itself is unique and interesting. The use of pigeons and \"Geminis\" is something fresh and new. The one down side is I could have done without was the whining I felt by some of the characters. I'm hoping for a sequel and more back story as well as more action and confrontation. This almost seemed like fantasy wrapped up nice and neat. Here's to hoping for more drama, less whining and more info on the Scabs and their origination."}], "description": "SCABS: The Gemini Exception A strange phenomenon occurs out of nowhere.
