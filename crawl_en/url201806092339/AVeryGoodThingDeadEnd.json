But with fewer zombies than the previous books. This book was more on forging of alliances and building trust within the surviving groups.I enjoy the writing style, but I can see how some people wouldn't. It can be a little disjointed here and there, more a train of thought style than a narrative style. My one disappointment with the book is that this one had far more grammatical and typographical errors than the first two. It could have used a bit more proof reading before it was published."}, {"userName": "Grant Merrifield", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39404097-grant-merrifield", "userReview": "This seriesThe feels man the feels.
