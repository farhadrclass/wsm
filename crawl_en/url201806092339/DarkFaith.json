I cannot recommend it highly enough to fans of horror and dark fiction.The theme of the collection is faith of all types: having faith or losing faith or finding faith; faith in higher powers, faith in the goodness of people and faith in the ugliness of people; faith in yourself and faith in the cold, uncaring machinations of the world around you.Like the other Apex anthologies I've read, there were a few pieces that were a little too abstract my unsophisticated brain to wrap around. \"The Mad Eyes of the Heron King\" by Richard Dansky, \"First Communions\" by Geoffrey Girard and especially \"To the Jerusalem Crater\" by Lavie Tidhar were too obtuse and deeply allegorical for me to connect with. I leave it to more educated and widely read readers to extract higher purposes from them. I did enjoy reading them at a purely technical level, the writing is superb even if the greater meaning eludes me.The real standout stories will each sit with me for a long time. I especially liked \"Ghosts of New York\" by Jennifer Pelland, a story about acceptance, remembrance and the tragedies we relive in our heads every day. \"He Who Would Not Bow\" by Wrath James White has a protagonist I identify with deeply and expores the space between your own awareness and that of omniscience. The next story in the anthology also hit me deeply, \"Zen and the Art of Gordon Dratch's Damnnation\" by Douglas F. Warrick, another allegory on acceptance, focuses on humility and the way we create our own hells for ourselves. I related this story to my own relationship to alcohol.\"Mother Urban's Booke of Dayes\" by Jay Lake covers the same territory as \"He Who Would Not Bow\", but from an entirely opposite angle. For the first few paragraphs, I thought it was rehashing a lot of common characters and scenes, but Jay brings them all to life and makes the story feel vivrant with a freshness and vigor I truly found inspiring. J. C. Hay's \"A Loss for Words\" is an excellent study of the classical Calliope tale, set in the modern world. As someone who just decided to be a writer it struck a cord and made me question my own creative process. \"The Choir\" by Lucien Soulban uses Cthulu-esque imagery and plot to show that the best of humanity can come through in the face of the worst horrors. The final story, and a perfect choice for ending the book, \"For My Next Trick I'll Need a Volunteer\" by Gary A. Braunbeck is a tale of redemption with strong overtones of \"A Christmas Carol\" and \"It's A Wonderful Life\", though it's clearly dark fiction.There are several other stories I didn't mention, please don't thing that because I'm a lazy reviewer that they aren't worthy. There wasn't any weak piece in this book; reading it in order like I did is the heroes journey. It starts out in an unhappy place, goes through hell, fights monsters and finally comes out at the end on a positive note. As a collection of stories, it's one of the best anthologies I've ever read."}, {"userName": "Nick Cato", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1194742-nick-cato", "userReview": "These 31 all-new stories and poems explore not just religious, but several kinds of faith from many different angles.After Linda D. Addison's opening psuedo-Genesis poem, Jennifer Pelland's 'Ghosts of New York' gets things off to an intense start; this one tells the tale of a woman who continually finds herself jumping from a skyscraper, soon to learn she's among those who were killed on 9/11.Brian Keene's 'I Sing A New Psalm' is like a religious version of Steve Gerlach's novel RAGE (with an ending that's equally as depressing; while not my cup of tea it does make a strong point); Wrath James White's judgment day story, 'He Who Would Not Bow,' deals with a group of people who learn they might be able to kill God who is now here on earth; the ending took me by surprise. In 'Zen and the Art of Dratch's Damnation,' Douglas F. Warwick takes a disturbing look at one man's suffering in the afterlife (along with the sarcastic beings who taunt him).I always thought most pictures of Jesus made him look like a California Surfer Dude. Kyle S. Johnson pictures him that way in his apocalyptic 'Go and Tell it on the Mountain,' where--to the surprise of a man who lived a good life but didn't follow any religion--Christ appears as a bored, cigarette-smoking, disobedient man who has returned to tell some people the truth (that there's nothing after this world) and various lies (He takes pleasure in telling former religious people all kinds of weird theories). Eliyanna Kaiser brings the goods with 'Different From Other Nights,' where a young Jewish girl takes her seder and passover a bit more literally than her rabbi. Another short & (un)sweet poem by Rain Graves doubles as an intro of sorts to Nick Mamatas' dazzling 'The Last Words of Dutch Schultz Jesus Christ,' which explores the effects of an obscure movie known as The God Film.In the bizarre 'To the Jerusalem Crater' by Lavie Tidhar, a young boy goes on a journey of spiritual awakening, while Matt Cardin's 'Chimeras & Grotesqueries' deals with someone who becomes a bit too influenced by their favorite author. Ekaterina Sedia's 'You Dream' is a gloomy (and absorbing) faith-hunt set in Moscow while Jay Lake's 'Mother Urban's Booke of Days' gives a young man the ability to control his surroundings.'The Mad Eyes of the Heron King' is one of the creepier entries here as Richard Dansky delivers a morbid tale of judgment. D.T. Friedman's entertaining 'Paint Box, Puzzle Box' features an artist who manages to escape death through the worlds he creates in his paintings, while J.C. Hays' 'A Loss for Words' looks at an author who pays a prostitute by writing original stories on her flesh (and, yes, this one goes deep); in another author-themed story, the always-reliable Tom Piccirilli strikes with 'Scrawl,' about a nerdy-looking erotica writer who finds inspiration with a mistress during a convention.Kelli Dunlap's 'Good Enough' is a May/Pieces-ish serial killer/suicide yarn that more than lives up to its title, while Geoffrey Girard's 'First Communion' (another one dealing with suicide) takes a dark look at missed love. In 'The God of Last Moments,' Alethea Kontis explores an icon and a (literal) inner demon, then Mary Robinette Kowal's Norse God fable 'Ring Road' will surely leave you heart-broken.Chesya Burke's impressive 'The Unremembered' is a richly-symbolic take on miracles, culture, and the importance of oral tradition, then SS-bred slug creatures mix with an acceptance-based theme in Lucien Soulban's 'The Choir.'What would any modern horror anthology be without a zombie story? Thankfully, 'The Days of Flaming Motorcycles' by Catherynne M. Valente is a fresh, funny, and creepy take on them. Lucy A. Snyder's 'Miz Ruthie Pays Her Respects' will surely knock some readers for a loop, while Kurt Dinan's 'Paranoia\" turned out to be my favorite poem of the lot.'Hush' by Kelly Barnhill manages to sneak in a fine haunted house story while Richard Wright's 'Sandboys' explores the faith of a father who truly believes he'll again see the son who was taken from him again.Gary A. Braunbeck provides the end piece with another Cedar Hill story titled 'For My Next Trick I'll Need a Volunteer.' This study on good and evil features Detective Bill Emerson contemplating a violent child abuse case, being taken on a surreal journey by The Reverend. With Gary's trademark roller-coaster-ride of emotions and ideas on display, those eagerly awaiting his next Cedar Hill novel will find this to be quite the fix.At times surprising, scary, humorous and almost always thought provoking, DARK FAITH is a must read for fans of religious horror and those seeking some chills of a deeper nature."}, {"userName": "Scott Nicholson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3356194-scott-nicholson", "userReview": "A diverse group of viewpoints, at times hard-hitting and other times poignant.

Or, you could just ask Maurice Broaddus about it. Maurice, himself a devout Christian, has no qualms in recognizing the darker elements of faith, as well shining a little of that gospel of the terrifying. And considering the caliber of authors he coerced into contributing to this anthology, the guy knows how to strike a balance. It's just kind of funny to hear how such a nice, talented guy gets such strange looks from others when they find out the kinds of stories he writes. We've all been there, I suppose.Dark Faith amasses thirty-one authors with short stories, and a couple poems, that all deal in one way or another with faith. From that one starting point, each author goes off on their own path, each story following its own north star, as it were. Now, I'm still a guy who doesn't shine towards poetry, so my focus was on the fiction. Two short stories immediately jumped out at the beginning of the anthology with disparate tones, but equally rending effect. Jennifer Pelland's \"Ghosts of New York\" is a sad portrait of a woman's afterlife in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. As I recall, Jennifer was a bit hesitant about how this story would be received by readers, given its setting, but I thought it was tragic feat of beauty. Then, there was Brian Keene's \"I Sing a New Psalm,\" with a hard-bitten tone that practically jumps off the page and dares you to hit back.From there, the anthology carries on with stories like Ekaterin Sedia's \"You Dream\", a story I liked despite its use of second-person POV which I rarely enjoy; Catherynne M. Valente's \"Days of Flaming Motorcycles\", which was already a favorite of mine after reading it online in a couple other venues; plus Tom Piccirilli's \"Scrawl\" and an increasingly creepy stroll through fetishism and self-loathing.The book is just about the furthest thing you can get from a religious screed designed to convert or dissuade people from God. If you're thinking that, you can knock it off. This anthology is a bit like a confessional, but more like a open-ended prayer uttered to no one god in particular. Whatever ear the song falls on, it is hopefully a friendly one. For an atheist like me, it was kind of nice to see horror and faith meet with a more sophisticated approach than evil priests and generic zealotry posited as villains. What villains there are in this book are ourselves, more or less. Our frailties. And no matter which god you believe in, Westboro Baptists not withstanding, you ought to see that the book may be dark, but it does shed some light on the idea of faith.With thirty-one stories and poems packed into one book, you are bound to not like all of them, but--by gawd--you should like most of 'em.There's a Dark Faith 2 in the works, and I think it's set for release sometime in the latter half of 2012, so you can bet that I'll be keeping my eye out for that one when the time comes. I may not be a good little Christian soldier, but I am a satisfied customer."}, {"userName": "Monster", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/778752-monster", "userReview": "Dark Faith is loaded with thirty-one new stories and poems on faith and spirituality in all of its forms. I\u2019ve always loved the marriage of faith and the horror genre, going back to books like The Sentinel by Jeffrey Konvitz and William Peter Blatty\u2019s The Exorcist, and this anthology doesn\u2019t disappoint. Among my favorite stories in the collection are \u201cGood Enough\u201d by Kelli Dunlap, about a relationship that goes wrong, a history of bad choices, and a serial killer who doesn\u2019t fit the usual profile\u2014it\u2019s a nice twist on the Frankenstein tale; \u201cMiz Ruthie Pays Her Respects\u201d by Lucy A. Snyder, about a woman who decides to finally get her revenge on a respected member of the family and community; and \u201cGhosts of New York\u201d by Jennifer Pelland, about a woman who keeps reliving her death in the Twin Towers, and finding others just like herself. I also thoroughly enjoyed Wrath James White\u2019s \u201cHe Who Would Not Bow\u201d, about a small group of people who find out they can kill God while He is on earth; Althea Kontis\u2019 \u201cThe God of Last Moments\u201d, about a young man who begins feeding on the power of the dead\u2019s last moments; and Tom Piccirilli\u2019s \u201cScrawl\u201d, about an average writer who finds inspiration one night during a writers\u2019 convention. Other notable stories include \u201dFor My Next Trick I\u2019ll Need a Volunteer\u201d by Gary Braunbeck, about the strange trip Detective Emerson is taken on by his friend the Reverend; \u201cA Loss for Words\u201d by J.C. Hay, about a writer who pays a prostitute (who happens to be a Muse) to write his words all over her body; \u201cGo Tell it on the Mountain\u201d by Kyle S. Johnson, which tells about a man\u2019s meeting with a hippie-like Christ just after a global apocalypse; \u201cI Sing a New Psalm\u201d by Brian Keene, which tells of a man who finds faith in God only to have that faith leave him again; and \u201cFirst Communions\u201d by Geoffrey Girard, a touching story about suicide, love and God. I also want to mention the beautifully dark poem \u201cLilith\u201d by Rain Graves, and the opening poem, The Story of Belief-Non by Linda D. Addison, which looks at the endless possibilities of life. While there are always a few misses in anthologies, the bulk of the stories in Dark Faith are great reads. Maurice Broaddus and Jerry Gordon did a fantastic job of editing it all. There are many more excellent stories I didn\u2019t mention above, so I encourage all horror fans to pick this one up\u2014I highly recommend it.Contains: Gore, blood and some sexual themesReview by Colleen Wanglund"}, {"userName": "Lashawn", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3516309-lashawn", "userReview": "Creepy, but hard to put down. Loved how the nature of faith, where it be Christian or otherwise, was explored in this book. I'll add more to the review when I get home but the first story, \"Ghosts of New York\" really struck home with me, whereas \"Zen and the Art of Gordon Dratch's Damnation\" had me curled in a corner, whimpering in fright. There was a couple of stories that made me wonder what it had to do with faith, whereas I started off \"Sandboys\" thinking it was heavyhanded and over-dramatic. By the end of it, though, I was in tears, and I had to go back and reread it to better appreciate the overwhelming sense of loss.

Some straight up horror stories, some broader fantasy/urban-fantasy, but all are strong and enjoyable. The \u2018Dark\u2019 element was consistent throughout, but I did get the feeling a few of the later ones were a little thin on the \u2018Faith\u2019 theme.Overall I felt this was a really well put together anthology, in a way that is more than just the quality of the stories. I got a sense of respect for the topic from this book, there was an 'even-handedness' that meant I didn't feel religion as a concept was being attacked (a danger for such a collection). But equally importantly, it also didn't take an easy route of avoiding any real life religions. Aspects of faith are examined honestly, sometimes brutally, through the fiction included here, in a way that is not flippant nor dismissive.Thematically it encompasses a broad range within the \u2018Faith\u2019 umbrella. These stories cover a disappointing meeting with Jesus after rapture, detail a number of types of horrifying afterlives, show us exactly what it would be like to live directly under the oppressive and brutally omniscient presence of an unforgiving god on Earth, and so on. Multiple religions are referenced, both real and imaginary, and there is enough variety to ensure that most readers should be satisfied.HitsAll of the stories are great, but some really stuck in my mind.Right from the beginning, it kicks off with a great ghost story by Jennifer Pelland \u201cGhosts of New York\u201d dealing with the tormented spirits of those who died in the Twin Towers on 9/11. We then shift to \u201cI Sing a New Psalm\u201d by Brian Keene, where a man asks the question of how god can give love only to take it away, and he decides on terrible and violent answer.Moving on to we hit another great story by Richard Dansky in \u201cThe Mad Eyes of the Heron King\u201d; a weird tale of a sad little man who finds something worth worshiping in a proud, talking, Heron. \u201cA Loss For Words\u201d by J.C. Hay was a captivating if grim alternative look at Calliope the Greek Muse in a modern (and commercial) setting.MissesIn my view, none of the stories could strictly be classified as \u2018misses\u2019; by this I mean that they were all strong and entertaining. However, as I said at the start, some of these stories seem to be a little outside the concept of faith or belief, which does work against an otherwise deeply thematic anthology like this. \u201cScrawl\u201d by Tom Picirilli was a solid piece of dark (S&M erotic) storytelling but I couldn\u2019t connect it with religion or spirituality in any real sense. \u201cSandboys\u201d by Richard Wright was an excellent tale (and as a father I both loved it whilst it still hit me where it hurts) but faith?...I felt the connection was tenuous at best (or I missed it anyway).There were also some short poems scattered about in between the stories. These were fine, but ultimately didn\u2019t make much of an impression on me (probably because I\u2019m a bit poetically ignorant).SummaryDark Faith is an enjoyable collection of stories that will please anyone looking to peek into some of the nastier imagined corners of religious belief.This review can be found (with a few additional words and links) here: https://uncertaintales.wordpress.com/..."}, {"userName": "Misha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2205814-misha", "userReview": "I bought this for Jennifer Pelland's Nebula-nominated short story \"Ghosts of New York,\" but I'm finding it a strong anthology overall thus far.After a poem, \"Ghosts of New York\" leads the anthology with a discomfiting story of the ghost of a woman who jumped from the North Tower on Sept. 11, 2001, and must relive the fall again and again. The story ends on a surprisingly positive note of acceptance and peace. The subject matter is difficult, but the story is thought-provoking and very well-written. Pelland earned her Nebula nomination, and will have earned her win if she gets the award.\"He Who Would Not Bow\" has similar themes to \"Ghosts of New York\" in that the characters are trying to cope with and make sense of violence and grief, only this time the violence is perpetrated by God himself made flesh on Earth, and sending forth an angel with a flaming sword to raze cities across the globe with fire.
