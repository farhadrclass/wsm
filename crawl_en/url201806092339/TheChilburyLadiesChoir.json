It is a quintessentially British story set in Kent about a community of women contributing to the war effort, trying to survive and live life whilst the world as they know it is crumbling around them. Helping them to cope with the grief and loss is the Chilbury Ladies Choir set up by incomer Primrose, despite the opposition of Mrs B. who thinks its a scandal to have a choir without men. Women are having to step in and do what men have done, they have no choice. The choir becomes important in providing a channel to keep their spirits up, channel emotional distress, provide support and personal development.With warmth, wit and humour, the author gives us a wide range of characters with all the petty resentments, falling in love, tragedies and intrigue that beset any community. Mrs Tilling is a midwife, who finds herself digging deep into her emotional reserves to support others, expands her world view as she comes to see the humanity in others even when their actions may not appear to deserve it. The lightweight and flirty Venetia comes to be a revelation as her personal circumstances become dire. New relationships are cemented through billeting as with Colonel Mallard. The emotional intensity of the young can be seen through the eyes of the young, such as thirteen year old Kitty. We get a glimpse of the class system where characters like the Brigadier and the Viscount find their established power being undermined. We see what is happening in Europe through Sylvie, a young Jewish evacuee. Edwina struggles to keep her unsavoury secrets and keep her ill gotten gains. All the action takes place where there is a real and tangible fear that Britain might come under Nazi rule.I became totally engaged with the characters and the pressures they are living under. I particularly loved Mrs Tilling and Prim, women who come to realise they have nothing to lose and can be exactly who they are and so becoming role models for others. In a sense, this is true to varying degrees for all the women. It is through the prism of loss that the women come to understand this and therefore learn to challenge traditional norms. This novel celebrates all that women did during the war and the role that music and the choir provide in inspiring, a route to express grief and providing succour. I think anyone who reads this will enjoy it. Highly recommended. Thanks to HarperCollins for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Annet", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166369-annet", "userReview": "Notice pinned to the Chillbury village hall noticeboard, Sunday 24th March, 1940: As all our male voices have gone to war, the village choir is to close following Cmdr Edmund Winthrop's funeral next Tuesday - The VicarLovely book!

With very few men left in the village, the women in the village decide it is their duty to keep things going, maintain normality as much as possible and this includes restarting the disbanded choir, with women only members.I love reading books that are written as letters, journal entries, articles etc. I honestly don't think I would have had such a positive reaction to this book of done in straightforward pose, would probably have come off too syrupy or gossipy. This was the perfect form for this story. Just telling glimpses of everyone's lives, their feelings and a general understanding of what was happening in the village and believe you me there is quite a bit going to tell. Love affairs, pregnancies, a amoral midwife, births, death, love affairs old, grief over lives lost, sons and husbands sent to fight. Yet, it is a wonderful telling of women empowerment and their desire to keep the home fires burning."}, {"userName": "Fran", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12653120-fran", "userReview": "\"The Chilbury Ladies' Choir\" is an epistolary novel providing a snapshot of the experiences of a group of mostly women during World War II over the time period from March-September 1940. Able bodied men have joined the war effort and the Vicar has decided to disband the choir saying that only a mixed chorus will do! Enter Primrose Trent, music professor. Prim restructures the choral music for women's voices only, the Vicar concedes defeat, and The Chilbury Ladies' Choir is born. Music is the salve that helps the town cope with loss of friends,spouses and the pain of unrequited love.Through the use of journal entries, letters, and occasional notices, the lives of several residents are highlighted. Mrs. Tilling, a nurse with a quiet demeanor, finds her true voice while the misdeeds of unethical midwife Edwina Paltry play out. The antics of Venetia, a self absorbed older sister and those of awkward thirteen year old Kitty, a budding singer, are vividly portrayed as they share their thoughts and dreams through the written word. Mrs. B. a control freak and gossip, testy to all, will have to cooperate with the ladies since The Chilbury Ladies' Choir is determined to enter a choral competition. The choir provides a support system for these women. They raise their voices in mournful prayer, when needed, but sing of hope and recovery.Stylistic use of documents and letters provides excellent character studies of the residents in this town near Dover. We view the growth of Mrs. Tilling and Venetia as well as the demise of Edwina Paltry. We applaud their successes and are tearful for their losses. \"The Chilbury Ladies' Choir\" by Jennifer Ryan was a most enjoyable read.Thank you Crown Publishing and Net Galley for the opportunity to read and review \"The Chilbury Ladies' Choir\"."}, {"userName": "PorshaJo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5464046-porshajo", "userReview": "How could you not like a book that uses the word 'higgledy-piggledy' in it....multiple times. The Chilbury Ladies Choir is quite the fascinating read. A different take on WW2 and how people survive during this time. Don't get me wrong, any book on WW2 and the horrors is difficult to read. But this one, I found both sad and fascinating, heartbreaking and funny. The story is told over a series of letters, newspaper articles, and journal entries and switches back and forth between these and various characters. You learn of the various people in the town of Chillbury. There is the wicked Edwina Paltry and the story of how low one person can sink. Or the saucy tart Victoria Winthrop, who changes, even grows-up during the war. Or bossy Mrs. B and her know-it-all attitude. Then there is the war, the bombings, the lives lost and during this time, the folks of Chillbury. Most of the men have gone off to war and it's up to the ladies in town to stand up and prove that they CAN do it. Such as to start an all female choir, enter a singing competition, become pall bearers, and show how brave they are. I started this one ages ago and life got in the way. So I decided to switch to the audio recently. I loved the narration and the different voices and accents. And a bonus....choir music was included at the most perfect times. I did have a few nitpicks with this one though, hence the lower rating. I didn't care for the audio narration where it would indicate a male spoke. Sometimes the narrator, usually female, would do this odd voices for say, gruffy older men. And the precocious child Kitty,narrating into her journal, who at 13 used phrases that no 13 would know what they mean (the sirens were blistering, her talk of the black market). But those are minor items. Overall, an enjoyable read and one that I'm glad I finally finished."}, {"userName": "Margitte", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7481492-margitte", "userReview": "First funeral of the war, and our little village choir simply couldn\u2019t sing in tune. \u201cHoly, holy, holy\u201d limped out as if we were a crump of warbling sparrows. But it wasn\u2019t because of the war, or the young scoundrel Edmund Winthrop torpedoed in his submarine, or even the Vicar\u2019s abysmal conducting. No, it was because this was the final performance of the Chilbury Choir. Our swan song....It was the funeral of Edmund Winthrop, the Brigadier\u2019s despicable son who was blown up in a submarine last week. Only twenty he was\u2014one minute a repulsive reptile, the next a feast for the fishes....Beside her, that foreign evacuee girl looked petrified, like she\u2019d seen death before and a lot more besides.And so begins a novel, with Miss Edwina Paltry's letter to her sister (quite a fitting surname given the different meanings: small, meagre, trifling, insignificant, negligible, inadequate, insufficient, scant, scanty, derisory, pitiful, pitiable, pathetic, miserable, sorry, wretched, puny, trivial, niggardly, beggarly, mean, ungenerous, inappreciable, mere).The fictional tale and characters are based on the real diaries and journals which were written during the first year of WWII in Britain for an organization called Mass Observation. They published a newsletter in which the hearts, minds and souls of the ordinary citizens were shared.The epistolary character of the novel is the result of the author's commemoration of these writers, and the stories her grandmother shared about the war. Four main narrators share through their diaries and letters the funny, racy, touching or terrifying events in Chilbury during 1940, leaving the reader in the midst of a richly textured novel populated by the citizens of the fictional village of Chilbury. The main narrators are:Miss Edwina Paltry - in letters to her sister:Brace yourself, Clara, for we are about to be rich! I\u2019ve been offered the most unscrupulous deal you\u2019ll ever believe! I knew this ruddy war would turn up some gems\u2014whoever would have thought that midwifery could be so lucrative! But I couldn\u2019t have imagined such a grubby nugget of a deal coming from snooty Brigadier Winthrop, the upper-class tyrant who thinks he owns this prissy little village. I know you\u2019ll say it\u2019s immoral, even by my standards, but I need to get away from being a cooped-up, put-down midwife. I need to get back to the old house where I can live my own life and be free. Mark these words: her little scheme would have her flustered like a bluebottle in a jam jar in the end.Kitty Winthrop - in her diary - thirteen years old: she saw people as beams of a rainbow, and her eighteen-year-old sister, Venitia, as simply a vile beast.I like to see people as colors, a kind of aura or halo surrounding them, shading their outsides with the various flavors of their insides. Me\u2014purple, as brilliant and dark as the sky on a thundery night Mama\u2014a very pale pink, like a baby mouse Daddy\u2014soot black (Edmund was also black, but black like a starless sky) Mrs. Tilling\u2014light green, like a shoot trying to come up through the snow Mrs. B.\u2014navy blue (correct and traditional) Henry is a deep azure blue, to match his eyes.Silvie - in her diary - the much younger Jewish evacuee from Czechoslovakia with her terrible secret.Venitia Winthrop - in her letters to the vicar's daughter, Angela Quail.Mrs. Tilling - in her journal - a nurse and the local billeting agent.Two male voices appeared in their own letters as well. Flt. Lt. Henry Brampton-Boyd - the most sought-after bachelor in the village. He had many a nasty nail out on dainty little ladies' fingers and a lot to answer for. Even Elsie the parlour maid got her head around something. Colonel Mallard - in his letters to his sister Mrs. Maud Green. He arrived as curmudgeon old Mr. Bear, and left as snuggly Mr. Toodles, well .... sort of. Life would drastically change for him in Chilbury, that's for sure. Miss Primrose Trent from London moved into Chilbury to become the Professor of Music at the Lichtfield University. She revived the choir, now deprived of all the men who went off to war. The Vicar Quail was convinced that all the oxygen and raison d'etre left town with the men. The women would prove him wrong. The choir gave women their voices. The voices they thought they never had. And therein lies the charm of this story of courage, endurance, resilience and hope.The peripheral characters brought much more color to Kitty's rainbow. They read like the Chilbury telephone directory, but what a wonderful, unbelievable, atmospheric tale they all brought alive.I'm not going into the plot or storyline. It is for the readers to discover and enjoy through the picturesque prose.GREAT READ!!!

As opposed to a single writer, here we have a variety of writers of all ages and stripes. Starting at the beginning of WWII, the village is dealing with the absence of most of its men. The vicar disbands the choir as it lacks the necessary tenors and basses. But here comes a new music instructor to the nearby University and she forms The Chilbury Ladies\u2019 Choir. \u201cIt is time for us women to do what we can as a group to support each other and keep our spirits up.\u201d As someone who has sung for years in a choir, it's a true sentiment. There is something uplifting about making music with others. In fact, she is spot on about all things involved in singing- that moment before coming in on a note when singing a capella, the fear of the solo or the community from singing together. Ryan does a great job of fleshing out each character. And there are some real characters here. Kitty\u2019s writing does seem very grownup for a thirteen year old but that's a minor quibble especially because Ryan does capture the girl\u2019s crush on Henry perfectly.  This novel manages to blend humor, warmth, sorrow and depth all within its pages. The book is based on her grandmother\u2019s stories of a choir she sung in during WWII and the freedoms women had because of the war. For those who enjoyed The Summer Before the War or the tv series Land Girls or Home Fires, I would recommend this novel. A full five stars!

I looked forward to reading a WWII novel set in a English Village, an epistolary novel written from the viewpoint of the women left behind when the men went off to war. Let me say right off that it was a very good story with some intrigue, some mystery, and an unusual plot.What bothered me was that the letters and journals seemed a bit contrived. I've never yet seen a journal that quotes entire conversations verbatim, with quotation marks. Most of the journal entries were written as straight narrative, which may have been a better way to connect the events.The characters all seemed wooden and one-dimentional to me, more like characatures than anything else. As a result, I could never feel close to any of them, with the exception of Sylvie, the 10 year old Czechoslovakia refugee. She didn't really fit into any mold, and came across as a real person.The ending was a bit contrived as well, wrapping everything up very neatly with happy ever after for all.I think what I'm trying to say is that I expected more depth from this novel, and it ended up being just a routine chick-lit, which is sometimes just fine, but not what I wanted right now."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "4.5 Stars\n\"NOTICE PINNED TO THE CHILBURY VILLAGE HALL NOTICEBOARD, SUNDAY, 24TH MARCH, 1940As all our male voices have gone to war, the village choir is to close following Cmdr.

It has given us everyday women a voice - dared us to stand up for ourselves, and to stand up for others.\" -Jennifer Ryan, The Chilbury Ladies' ChoirThis book had a little bit of everything I look for in a story. Beautiful writing, multi-dimensional characters, a wonderfully illustrated setting, and a dose of rich history. The story of the formation of the Chilbury Ladies' Choir during the spring and summer of 1940, is told through the voices of four very different women. I love a book told through multiple POVs, and in this case it was done perfectly. All characters' voices are developed to give a deep and rounded picture of who the woman is, and considering that this book is a normal length, that is quite a feat by the Jennifer Ryan.Possibly my favorite part of this book was the way the author painted a picture of community in this small English village during the war. There is something so touching about neighbors, broken families, friends and even foes banding together in times that are so our of the ordinary. That being said, this book isn't cheesy or overly sappy. There can never be a completely happy ending in a book that deals with the Second World War (or any for that matter) but there is still a strong sense of hope that runs through the whole story, and for that and all the other above mentioned attributes, I think I can already say, even though it is only January, this will be one of my favorite books this year.If you enjoyed books like The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society or Letters from Skye, I think you will love this as much as I did.I won my copy of The Chilbury Ladies' Choir in a Goodreads giveaway, and have written what I think is a fair and fitting review.

The Chilbury Ladies\u2019 Choir is an endearing, uplifting and refreshing story about five members of The Chilbury Ladies\u2019 Choir who are left behind as the men go off to fight in the war.

The first thing they establish is The Chilbury Ladies' Choir, as they realize the power of music will not only help them get through the war, but help build a sense of community with the other townspeople. This is an endearing story that is filled with friendship and camaraderie as the women lose loved ones and face hardship, but use their choir time and music as a way to work through their pain and loneliness. However, this is not your typical war novel as Jennifer Ryan uses letters and journal entries to show how scandalous secrets are being kept and how romance has found its way into the village. The characters are well developed and you will even find yourself laughing out loud at times, but then you also feel their sadness as the war descends upon their little town.This book is somewhat of a lighter twist on World War ll fiction, but that doesn't lessen the enjoyment of this engaging story.

Up until now there has been a choir, but now with the men gone the vicar has cancelled the choir. But... soon the women are rallying around Prim the choir mistress and they are setting up their own group. The story is told by four or five characters through letters and journals. However it is seamless and actually doesn't feel like letters and diaries. Rather the story told from different points of view. That's where the narrators come in, they do an amazing and outstanding work of bringing this book to life. By itself its a great story, with the narration absolutely brilliant. I see on Jennifer Ryan's website that the book has had the TV rights optioned by the makers of the makers of Downton Abbey. I sure have my fingers crossed that this will go ahead.The characters are really interesting, they feel like real people, some of them are rogues and worse, one of them rather precocious but delightful, others kind and compassionate and already the war is changing many of them.

We even have to believe that someone high up in British Intelligence tells another woman whom he barely knows that a third man is a British spy and one of the best they have merely out of the goodness of his heart to help along a pair of star-crossed lovers...The writing itself is bloated and full of similes that just bog it down: a morning is 'as wet as a slap round the face with a fresh-caught cod', mourners are 'sitting all plumped up and groomed like a row of black swans', and someone describes themselves as 'flustered as a bluebottle in a jam jar'.There is a kind of cosy warmth about it all, to be fair, with some nice touches (Dunkirk happening in the background, for example) but overall this feels like a BBC Sunday teatime serial that needs some charismatic actors to bring the whole thing to rather cheesy life.

World War 2 historical fiction is one of my favorite genres, and Jennifer Ryan writes a beautiful story with a very entertaining cast of characters. Chilbury is a small town in England close to the coast on the eastern side. As the story opens in 1941, most of the men have been called up to fight causing the vicar of the local church to disband the choir until after the war. A group of women, lead by a spirited newcomer, rebel against the vicar\u2019s wishes and create The Chilbury Ladies\u2019 Choir. The effect of the choir on Chilbury and several neighboring towns is immense, and I laughed out loud and cried many times.Jennifer Ryan tells the story in a series of journal entries and letters reminiscent of The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, and that method is very effective in this novel. The only thing I would change would be to have one or two of the letter recipients write back. I wanted to know a little about them too. The Chilbury Ladies\u2019 Choir contains so many lovely sentiments and statements about both the war and life generally. I found myself highlighting many of them as I read on my Kindle so I could back and reread them. My only other comment is about the cover. I definitely choose books by their covers (at least that is what usually catches my eye), and I do not feel like this cover accurately depicts the book \u2013 it is very old-fashioned looking. Had I not read the summary and learned it was about World War 2, I would not have chosen to read this book.I highly recommend this book. Thanks to Crown Publishing and NetGalley for the chance to read this ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn", "userReview": "This is a lovely, warm, often humorous story about a small village in England and the social changes it undergoes during WW2. Chilbury in Kent is largely made up of women now that the men have gone off to war and the story is largely brought to life through the means of journal entries and letters written by the women. When the vicar disbands the church choir because there are no male voices left, a newcomer, Miss Primrose Trent (Prim) announces that she will start up a choir just for women to help keep their spirits up and so the Chilbury Ladies Choir is born. I love the way the characters evolve as the war goes on. They are beautifully written with love and affection. Not all are pleasant and some have nasty secrets. Mrs Tilling, a WWI widow whose son is off fighting, is the local nurse and the one who changes most, transforming from a shy, mousy woman who always defers to others to a confident woman in charge of her own life and prepared to speak up for others. Along with Mrs Tilling, the two sisters, 18 year old Venitia and 13 year old Kitty tell much of the narrative. Venetia about the artist in the village and her attempts to ensnare him and Kitty about her singing lessons with Prim, the choir, the doings of her beastly sister Venetia and her adventures in the woods and fields with their Czech evacuee, 11 year old Sylvie.Grief and heartbreak do come to Chilbury during the war along with the rest of the nation and the Choir serves to support the women and give them some moments of joy and beauty. A wonderful read if you enjoy a heartwarming story about women discovering their own strengths and a very accomplished debut.."}, {"userName": "Faith", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17430801-faith", "userReview": "I was expecting more from this book, but it turned out to be conventional women's fiction with gossip, jealousy and unwanted pregnancy set during WWII. Since the story was told in the form of letters and journal entries, it was a little disjointed. Also, this stylistic convention wasn't convincingly done. I don't think people usually include full conversations in their correspondence and journals. I didn't hate it, but it was a very slight story.I received a free copy of the ebook from the publisher, but I wound up borrowing and listening to the audiobook from the library."}, {"userName": "Marialyce", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1277371-marialyce", "userReview": "Three and a half stars for a lovely story of woman who find their inner strength during WW 2.

That is until a newcomer to town rallies the women together and asembles the Chilbury Ladies\u00b4 Choir, the first women-only choir. While not everyone is in agreement, these women seek that their singing keeps the morale of the town up.I absolutely loved this novel! Something about WWII stories set in England are quite appealing to me, I find myself coming back to these without a specific agenda. Remniscent of such novels as \u00b4The Summer Before the War\u00b4 and \u00b4The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society\u00b4, this novel had charm, heart and wit. The cover compliments the print beautifully. Narrated through letters and journal entries, the focus of the novel were the women as they rally to put their choir, as well as their community, together. Told from varying perspectives, from a 13-year-old girl to a venerated nurse, the novel was both uplifting and thoughtful, even humorous in spots. The character progression was done very well for I found myself rooting for characters that initially I disliked. Through acts of bravery and compassion, the ladies\u00b4choir formed a camaraderie that in turn upheld the town of Chilbury.

The majority of men are at war, so the vicar decides to abandon the choir. Heaven forbid they should have a choir without male voices! When a newcomer suggests an all-female choir, there are cries of outrage. And some come from one or two of the women. But eventually common sense prevails and the Chilbury Ladies choir is formed. The story of this choir, and some of its members and the goings on in the village in Kent is told through letters or diary entries by various people. In this way the reader comes to see that there is a lot more going on in the village of Chilbury than anyone suspects.Although I was looking forward to reading this as I love books about the power of music and the value of choirs, it still took me a little while to get into this novel. Books told by diary entries and letters are not among my favourites, but after a while this story and its characters won me over. It gives insights into the way people cope and change during hard times like war, sometimes growing in stature, other times showing their true colours which are not so flattering. In this book you will see both. I particularly liked Prim, who starts the women\u2019s choir and also Mrs Tilling. Kitty Winthrop is a young teenager. As such she displays both good and bad traits, as well as flights of romanticism at times. A pretty accurate picture of a girl that age who has a stunning, older flirty sister, I would think. I enjoyed this book and loved all the references to old hymns and songs. Setting and characters are well conveyed. Some are likable and others not so much. I would bet most people have met a person very similar to Mrs B. It certainly gives a little bit different take on World War 2 and activities of the women left behind. Well worth reading, even if at times it did seem a little like a soap opera. A real feel good read though to enjoy."}, {"userName": "Karen White", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10178843-karen-white", "userReview": "Absolutely loved everything about this book!

The book did convey the prevailing atmosphere of the times, with the men off at war, and the women left to cope and worry. Anxiety overshadowed their very existence, as the threat from enemy bombs was constant. Also fear of the dreaded telegram crept into many lives.A turning point occurred, however, when the recently diminished choir found courage to proceed without any male voices, despite the vicar\u2019s ruling to the contrary. Music was a strong draw, providing a sense of community and purpose. Suddenly a powerful distraction took shape, and spirits lifted! As one who can\u2019t sing at all, I\u2019ve always envied those who have that release. Perhaps this sentiment is at the root of my sheepish complaint that the joy of music reiterated throughout seemed a bit redundant! The epistolary format was quite effective, although some of the letters went on at such length as not to be credible. However, that was the way people communicated. Phone use was limited and there was certainly no email! The Chilbury Ladies Choir has been reasonably compared to Home Fires, the excellent PBS series. I was also reminded of Maeve Binchy\u2019s novels, with lots of busy, buzzing characters interacting! The plot driven narrative notwithstanding, though, there was depth and food for thought: \u201cThen I looked out onto the horizon myself and realized that loss is the same wherever you go: overwhelming, inexorable, deafening. How resilient human beings are that we can learn slowly to carry on when we are left all alone, to fill the void as best we can. Or disappear into it.\u201d Thorough research was evident throughout, which was a definite strength. Very close to four stars!"}, {"userName": "\u2740\u22b1Rory\u22b0\u2740", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25852225-rory", "userReview": "3.5 Stars.A bit heavy handed and soap opera-ish at times, but enjoyable.

There is choir practice, intrigue, scandal, secrets, romance, tragedy and a few bombs. No jam making though and only one child evacuee.

Most of the men have left for the war effort and the ladies of Chilbury are saddened that the Vicar has disbanded the choir. He feels there are not enough male singers. Prim, a music professor newly moved to Chilbury thinks that the women should continue to sing in the choir and convinces the vicar. Once the women realize that there is nothing wrong with an all female choir, they begin to meet and bond. It doesn't take long before they realize that it's time for them to support each other and keep spirits up. They're not always in agreement, of course, and personalities occasionally clash, as always happens with a mixed group of people. This is how the relationships grow in this book, but it is so much more than just the choir. The story is told through a series of letters and journal entries written by Venitia and her sister Kitty, Sylvie (a Jewish evacuee), Mrs. Tilling (a nurse) and Edwina Paltry (a midwife).It was very interesting to see how the women in these small towns and villages in England stepped up to keep the homefires burning. There were also a number of issues that the author touched on: politics, war, child abuse, abortion, single mothers, pre-marital sex, black markets, spies, parental control over daughters, and women's rights. The relationships that developed between the women left behind as well as their strength of character was the backbone of this book. When I started reading it, I was not sure about the story and almost stopped reading it, but once I got into it I was glad I had persevered. This is not about the war or the holocaust, it is about surviving at home, during the war, in an area that was constantly at risk. A very good read. If you enjoy historical fiction, pick this one up and give it a whirl. I received a copy of this book from the First to Read Program prior to publication."}], "description": "The village of Chilbury in Kent is about to ring in some changes.This is a delightful novel of wartime gumption and village spirit that will make your heart sing out.Kent, 1940.In the idyllic village of Chilbury change is afoot.
