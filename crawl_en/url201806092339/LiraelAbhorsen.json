The first section was great. We meet Lirael, who is a loner and has trouble being around other people and communicating. She is a Daughter of the Clayr, but doesn't have the power of sight, she is an outcast.She finds a place to work where she might belong - the library! - and comes across a new, wonderful friend: The Disreputable Dog. I love TDD. So fun, so funny, stole the show! (Similar to what Mogget did in the first book.)But then, Part Two happens. Sam. Let me see... how can I describe Sam... Spoiled Prince. Weak. Spineless. Full of fear. Cowardly. His one good trait is loyalty and wanting to help his friend. I give him credit for that.He is the Abhorsen-in-training, but doesn't want to be. He is scared shirtless of his magic and ability and wants NOTHING to do with it. I just couldn't stand him. And most of the entire middle section was ALL.ABOUT.HIM.Maybe this is a reflection of the difference in my age and the target audience. It is difficult for me to handle immature behavior. But, he is/was like 19 or so, and raised to high standards as an heir. You kind of expect more. I did, at least. I wanted a more heroic character instead of a whiner. We get flashes of Lirael POVs and those were all good. It just lost momentum for me and the pacing never picked up. I felt like the book was way too long.I am glad that Sam got out of becoming the Abhorsen. Please, just put him in the back somewhere and let him play sports or something. Make more of his tennis rackets! Write him off, no more please!This may sound harsh, but Sam just really made the book sluggish and B-O-R-I-N-G to me. :/ Lirael = A+.The Disreputable Dog and Mogget = A+.Getting to see more of Sabriel and Touchstone = A+ (This takes place many years after book one after they are married and have two children - Sam is one of them.)Overall, I didn't hate it. I just didn't love it. Hopefully, the next one will be better. It sort of ended right in the middle of a scene. There was no resolution. For such a long book, it made it seem a bit like filler. But again, it's not bad at all.

The up side to that is in the meantime, I'd bought Abhorsen as well. That's important. Sabriel was a good stand-alone novel. Lirael and Abhorsen are not. In fact, I'd recommend that before you read Lirael 1) you read Sabriel first and 2) you have a copy of Abhorsen ready to pick up as soon as you finish Lirael. Lirael ends in the middle of something, and the two probably could have been combined into one very long novel.Still, I recommend the whole series. The characters may not be quite as awesome as Sabriel, but they're still very well-done and the story is wonderful. I'll definitely seek out more of Garth Nix's books after I finish this series."}, {"userName": "TS Chan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30279227-ts-chan", "userReview": "While the Abhorsen series continues to thrive on its magic and worldbuilding, the characterisation in Lirael is unfortunately not up to par with its predecessor, Sabriel. It does appear that Sabriel is written almost like a stand-alone, as this sequel takes place almost one and a half decade after the events in the first book with two new main characters; Lirael, a daughter of the Clayr and Prince Sameth, the son of Sabriel and Touchstone. Both characters demonstrate the typical angst and insecurity of teenagers; one who bemoans the absence of a power that is the birthright of her race and the other who decries the responsibility thrust upon him because of his birthright and powers. If I have to choose, I will say Lirael is definitely the more aggravating one. While the other Clayrs of ages younger than Lirael started gaining the power of Seeing, she remained an outcast as she continues to well into her teenage years without even a hint of it. However, it turns out that she is very adept at Charter magic and has the ability learn quickly and perform marvellous feats which most others cannot. BUT just because she cannot See, her anxiety that she will never fully be one of the Clayrs grates on her self-confidence and my patience. The appearance of the Disreputable Dog - a creature of magic - was a welcome change to Lirael's story. Not accepting her constant self-belittling, the Dog prods her into action that finally takes the direction of her tale towards an intriguing revelation of her potential heritage. Prince Sameth (or Sam) may be slightly less annoying but I do feel like giving him a good shake for both his actions and inaction in addressing his debilitating fear of his legacy. The Disreputable DogThe highlight of this series so far truly lies in the magic and worldbuilding. We learn more of the Clayr, a race who appeared briefly in Sabriel, and the birth of the Charter, created out of Free Magic. The seven bells used for necromancy and controlling both the living and the dead, which are tied to the creation of the Charter, are just simply fascinating. So is the portrayal of Death, which is a river, grey and cold, with currents pulling the dead through the Gates, nine in all before a soul goes beyond any necromancer's ability to be summoned back.The story also started to become more interesting when Lirael and Sam eventually encountered each other under grave circumstances. This also meant that the Disreputable Dog met Mogget, the cat, who is now accompanying Sam after he stole away from the palace under the guise of an ordinary traveller. It was pretty obvious from the start that both these creatures of magic had a history together, and not an entirely pleasant one. A delightful turn of events, one might say. The common thread that brought Lirael and Sam together is the potential re-emergence of an extremely dangerous and powerful entity engineered by a necromancer of considerable strength. As we find both our main characters getting to terms with each of their own true legacy, the enemy is moving ever closer to his goal. This volume concluded on an unresolved note, with Lirael and Sam both contending with the grim prospect of having to face this new adversary, setting up the stage for the next book, Abhorsen.

I completely agreed with that point\u2026in book 1. Pretty much everything I loved about the protagonist in Sabriel  is contradicted in the Mary-Sue that is Lirael, the main protagonist of book 2.Doormat/whiny/woe-is-me/doesn\u2019t think she\u2019s special even though all signs point to the annoyingly obvious fact that she is. Not only is she mega-talented (but thinks she\u2019s worthless), she has the added convenience of that \u201cdues ex machina\u201d magic that shows up unexpectedly and makes her 10x more awesome. It killed me that even after the Clayr explained that only super awesome Clayr develop \u201cthe Sight\u201d late and only incredibly important people are sent on missions, Lirael is ready to kill herself all over again and actually thinks they\u2019re just kicking her out. Yeah, ok, Lirael. Ok.And where Sabriel\u2019s looks weren\u2019t really mentioned and her \u201cromance\u201d was pretty dang tame for YA, Lirael, on the other hand, is a silent, sensitive wallflower who hides behind her hair but catches the eye of alllll the boys because they all find her beautiful, even though\u2026wait for it\u2026she doesn\u2019t find herself beautiful! Ugh, spare me. Sameth, the male protagonist isn\u2019t much better although he\u2019s a little more sympathetic. He might be somewhat of a spoiled brat, but at least his whining is more believable (not living up to his parents or elder sister\u2019s expectations, because, honestly, what they want for him isn\u2019t what he wants or is even capable of). Lirael, though, is out slaying beasts and is still like, \u201cShucks, I\u2019m no good at anything, why do I even bother living\u2026\u201d Gurl, write a sad poem in your journal and move on.Also, this book had no real ending. I\u2019m basically being forced to read the last book of the trilogy against my will. Basically.THREE STARS because Sabriel and Touchstone make cameos, Lirael occasionally takes breaks from moping to kick some butt, there\u2019s some crazy/creepy action sequences, Nix's world-building is always fun, and the two talking animals (Mogget and Dog) save the reader from utter boredom (concerning the main characters) with their snarky comments and superior characterization."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1118065-nicole", "userReview": "I'm not a huge fantasy person, but I'm always up for a kick-ass heroine such as Lirael.

Lirael was as appalling as Sabriel was awesome. It sported an insecure and impulsive heroine drowning in her angst and her companions: an idiot of a selfish prince and a dog (a dog!).Lirael is a Daughter of the Clayr, compensating her lack of Sight (i.e. the ability to see future) with other capabilities like outstanding sociopathy and a penchant for magic. Yes, Lirael is one of these special snowflakes we love reading about. She is so standing apart that she does not feel like talking to anyone, then she feels excluded, then she can go on through days of not talking to anyone, then she wants to commit a suicide because she feels excluded. In the course of drama, drama, drama, drama she becomes a librarian, visits places she's not supposed to venture to and creates a magic dog of considerable powers, possibly even bigger than her own (just like that). Finally, when it is confirmed just oh how special the girl is, she is sent out of the glacier to save the world. In the meantime, the idiot of a selfish prince, abandons his family and kingdom in the hour of need, gallivanting through the Dead infested country (in spite his overwhelming fear of Death) pursuing a quest of his own choosing. Because why not?Inevitably these two aggravating figures meet and misery ensues as they plunge from one trouble to another slowly piecing together the evil they must face. Even the Mogget was not enough to balance this preposterous setting. I was fuming throughout this novel, especially that it constitutes such stark contrast with Sabriel. I never expected to be let down by Mr Nix - and in such an underhanded manner! My wounds have already scarred, but still, the book does not deserve more than 2 stars and another half for the story potential. Lirael is the necessary prelude to Abhorsen, the third of the set. If your love is for Sabriel and Touchstone only, leave Lirael alone. If you want to learn more about the wonderful world of the Old Kingdom - keep calm and endure it, as the final part of the trilogy will make it worth your while.Also in the series: 1. Sabriel 3.

Why did Sameth have to be just as annoying as Lirael was amazing? Lirael was seriously such a fantastic protagonist, and I wish the book had focused almost entirely on her as opposed to bringing Sameth into the picture. He just seems like a bit of a waste in all honesty: annoying, spoiled, stupid, and obnoxious. If Sameth hadn't bugged me so much, I would have given this book a 4.5 or even a 5 star rating, but as it stands now I can only really give it a 4. I also felt that things significantly slowed down towards the end, and I just wanted it all to be finished. I think part of the reason for this is that I'm not convinced Garth Nix can write villains I really love or love to hate or can just get behind, you know? They all seem a little meh to me. That being said, I do want to emphasize that Lirael and the Disreputable Dog are AMAZING, and their portions in the book, everything about the Clayr and the Library, and just gah all the portions with Lirael were 5 stars for sure. The rest of the book I just wasn't as convinced about. I think this is also due in part to this being more of a part one to the story and Abhorsen being part two of the story.

The writing wasn't as beautiful as I hope for in fantasy novels. But his world building was thorough and very interesting. I went back and forth between liking the characters and not, which I think reveals how fully formed they are.I really liked the whole Charter marks and Free Magic stuff. I think it made a fascinating world and sense of magic. I liked that, just because Lirael was good with Charter marks, didn't make her all powerful; that there were weaknesses to how it can be used. I mostly liked the pace. In the beginning it took a bit to get going, especially once I could see where the story was going. But once the plot became focused for the characters it moved along very well. As far as the characters went, I didn't like Lirael in the beginning. I felt she was a very bland rather petulant character, but then she was obviously surrounded by a great deal of power so I was kind of fascinated. As the story continued, however, I liked her. In the reverse, I liked Sam pretty much right away then he devolved a little for me in the middle and was a little bit pathetic in moments. But then he got stronger and a little bit smarter and braver and I liked him again. In some ways - and this doesn't happen often - I was ok with the moments when I didn't like the characters because a) they were still surrounded by a great deal of power and b) it made them more human.

Yes, a real glacier. It\u2019s in a tall mountain at the very tip-top of her country, and she lives there with thousands of cousins, who are collectively called \u2018The Clayr,\u2019 most of whom are female and have the pale blonde hair and tanned skin that marks them as one of their own. They are entitled to this sobriquet because every single one of them can see the future. Every single one of them, except Lirael, that is. Most Clayr receive the Sight by the age of twelve. Lirael passes twelve. Then fourteen. Then seventeen. She is an adult, and she does not have the Sight. This is the main source of inner conflict in Lirael\u2019s life.Lirael is also different physically. Her black hair and pale, deathlike skin mark her immediately out from her fellow Clayr, but Lirael is also unusally quiet and reserved, because Lirael is very lonely. All the other Clayr have a purpose. They all take turns on the Watch, and they wear the robes of an adult, while Lirael still wears the robes of a child, simply because the main indicator of adulthood as a Clayr is the Sight, which, as discussed above, Lirael doesn\u2019t have. What\u2019s worse, none of the other Clayr have ever Seen Lirael. Not one. They don\u2019t know what to do with her any more than she knows what to do with herself.So instead of actually throwing herself off the highest peak of the glacier, as she almost did on yet another birthday without the Sight, she instead chooses to focus on learning the Charter (the magic system in the Old Kingdom), which leads to her creation of her companion the Disreputable Dog (who is THE BEST). This is the Disreputable Dog when she first meets Lirael:\n\u201cSuddenly, the dog stopped scratching, stood up, and shook itself, spraying droplets of dirty water all over Lirael and all over the study. Then it ambled across and licked the petrified girl on the face with a tongue that most definitely was all real and not some Charter-made illusion.When that got no response, it grinned and announced, \u2018I am the Disreputable Dog. Or the Disreputable bitch, if you want to get technical. When are we going for a walk?\u2019\u201d\nTogether, Lirael and the Dog explore the Clayr\u2019s magical, GINORMOUS library and mine it for secrets, defeating monsters lurking in the corners, and all the while honing Lirael\u2019s magic. Oh, yeah, did I mention that Lirael is a librarian? BECAUSE SHE IS TOTALLY A LIBRARIAN and the library is almost as terrifying and awesome as the Library the Doctor and Donna visit where the Library is an entire planet (and also the shadows are trying to kill them).Now, I\u2019m focusing on Lirael here because she\u2019s my favorite, but this book has other stuff going on, as well. It takes place 14-18 years after Sabriel (depending on Lirael\u2019s age), and Sabriel is barely in it at all. The two main characters are Lirael (obvs) and Sameth, Sabriel and Touchstone\u2019s son. The narrative starts with them apart as we get to know them, but eventually they meet up and things are pretty much BOOM BOOM BOOM from there on out. Both Lirael and Sam have good character arcs, their inner lives and conflicts are way more realized than Sabriel\u2019s were in book one. Sabriel can pretty much stand alone, but the second two books are basically one long continued story, with Lirael setting things up, and Abhorsen bringing them to a close. I think I prefer Lirael, though, because of the library, and because also Abhorsen honestly kind of scares the shit out of me.

For instance, the Clayr's glacier has an air of oppression and deep sadness, while the great library Lirael came to love conveyed a sense of hope. Every single place Lirael visited played an physical and an emotional role in the book. That brings me to how amazing the Clayr library is. It's everything any bookish person could ever wish for. It had thousands upon thousands of books, rooms filled with magical items, and the lurking threat of an escaped monster at every turn. So generally it was a ton of fun watching Lirael explore it all, learning crucial magics along the way. Lirael was fantastic. She embodies everything I look for in a protagonist. Smart, funny, and doesn't need no man to get the job done. Lirael managed to use her past to fuel her future, and didn't have the self pity that usually accompanies main characters. She was resourceful; furthering her knowledge of magic every time she could. She was always asking to read magic books or explore ancient tunnels in search of forgotten tomes. I really related to the curious side of her, cause if it were me, I'd be doing the exact same thing.I loved Lirael's furry companion, the Disreputable Dog almost as much as I loved her. The Dog is awesome. Seriously, where can I get one. She's loyal, funny, and wildly powerful. Unlike Mogget from Sabriel, the Disreputable Dog actually wanted to be with Lirael. It allowed for a kinship that was new to the series.Sadly, Mogget leads us to the negative part of the review.So Lirael has a split POV. This usually doesn't bother me, but I absolutely hated Sameth, the other character followed through the book. He is everything Lirael isn't; winey, self absorbed, and privileged. Intill later on in the story, all he does is make bad decisions and complain about the burdens of being the abhorsen in waiting. To make things worse, Mogget is asleep basically the entire time, so we don't get any reprieve from Sam's winey ways. Although, I could see a light at the end of the tunnel for Sam. Throught the series, I see endless potential for growth. He could become the brave warrior that fights for his kingdom. Maybe that day will come, but for the entirety of the book, he was a little snot that really needed to suck it up.Overall, the book was really good. Honestly, I'm regretting not have picking it up sooner. The ending was a bit abrupt, and Sameth was a little aggravating, Lirael and the world building made up for it seven fold."}, {"userName": "Shari Kay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12496588-shari-kay", "userReview": "Though the overall plot is very good...I had trouble warming up to the MC's. Lirael is full of self pity and is quite the whiner. She contemplates suicide a few times and because she is not a Seer like the rest of her people...she feels life isn't worth living. She shuts everyone out and makes herself, and the reader, fairly miserable. She eventually finds a place in the Library and proceeds to almost unleash an unspeakable horror that's been locked away with a big, \"DO NOT ENTER\" sign on the door. Does Lirael think maybe as an APPRENTICE librarian, (a job which by the way, she never would have gotten without the kindness of others and is lucky to have) maybe she really shouldn't break all the rules and out of curiosity break into a sealed room like a criminal ? Then when she does unleash this monster, does she ask anyone for help? Does it dawn on her that man, I may get in trouble for being where I wasn't suppose to be but heck people could die so I guess I should suck it up and tell someone what I've done? Um...that would be a, \"no\". She decides to handle it herself. But since she has no idea how to do that, she takes months to figure it out and prepare herself. All the while she is risking the creature's escape. After miracles of miracles she DOES manage to \"fix\" the problem...does she decide she barely escaped disaster and should never do it again? That'd be another, \"no.\" She just finds other ways to go where she shouldn't. Does she end up being a fairly brave girl...she does. Does she have a good heart...yes, she does. Did I find her as annoying as shite? Yes I did.This book is also about Sameth. Another whiny, self-pitying teenager who needs to use his words and not just moan and groan about everything.The dog and the cat...can't say I loved either one, but at least the despicable dog appears to have affection for and is trying to help Lirael...can't say the same for the Puss in Boots.And can I just say, Sabriel and Touchstone turned out to be fairly rotten parents...So as annoying as the characters were for a large majority of the book, the world is interesting and the magic is original. I really liked Nick.Will I read the final in the trilogy...probably. Eventually. Maybe."}, {"userName": "Nikki ", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223837-nikki", "userReview": "As much as I love Sabriel (both the book and the character!), I was reluctant to read this again. Lirael\u2019s role in the library is awesome, but both she and Sameth are rather too prone to self-pity to stand up well beside Sabriel\u2019s example. Which is part of the whole point, that Sameth\u2019s grown up in his parents\u2019 shadows, but still. While Sameth has serious problems to deal with, he\u2019s also selfish, doesn\u2019t think things through properly, and would do a lot better if he\u2019d open his mouth and let words come out. Sabriel and Touchstone might have a firm idea of their duty is, but I\u2019m pretty sure that they would also understand that Sameth\u2019s sickened fear would actually make a very bad Abhorsen.Communication, communication, communication. My pet peeve in real life and in fiction, alas.Lirael is more engaging, despite her bouts of self-pity. They\u2019re more understandable, and she has the Disreputable Dog to put a stop to it as well. Her life in the Clayr\u2019s glacier, her work in the library, her abilities with Charter marks and her explorations, all of those things are fascinating. And the Dog herself, too.It\u2019s difficult, because I do love this world, but Nix seems to have created a uniquely frustrating character/situation, perfectly balanced to annoy the heck out of me. I think I liked Abhorsen better, so I\u2019m hopeful about that and Clariel, but it was disappointing how much of a struggle this was to reread.Originally posted here."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237469-miriam", "userReview": "This sequel to Sabriel is stronger on character development but weaker on action; I don't think Nix has quite figured out how to balance the two aspects of the story. In Sabriel, the heroine (and we as the readers) were plunged almost immediately into the dangerous journey across the Wall. While I liked Sabriel, I found her a bit flat and her relationship with Touchstone not terribly convincing emotionally. With Lirael, we spend much more time watching her grow up and develop some confidence. Her emotional shortcomings are due to a lonely and somewhat neglected childhood, caused in part by her own self-conscious of her difference from those around her. She is shy but adventurous, loves her dog, and tends to let her curiosity lead her into danger. The enormous magical library where she works is a wonderful setting. But although she has some adventures there, and the secondary character Sameth has some adventures of his own, their meeting and the major plot don't really get underway until near the end of the book, leaving the majority of the story for the next volume."}, {"userName": "\u013dubo\u0161", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29190585-ubo", "userReview": "Ak si mysl\u00edte, \u017ee je Sabriel skvel\u00e1...Lirael je e\u0161te skvelej\u0161ie\u00fa\u017easnej\u0161ia...Pre\u010do mi to travlo tak ku*evsky dlho? -_- Eh...jeden d\u00f4vod by tu bol.
