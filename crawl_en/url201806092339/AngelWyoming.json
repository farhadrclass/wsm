Having sent for a peacemaker to settle a neighboring feud- not someone who would stir up a hornet\u2019s nest- the man known as the Angel of Death simply would not do.Angel had never met a woman quite like the Stuart girl, not exactly a beauty- but definitely intriguing. At first thinking he didn\u2019t even like her, he found himself surprised to want to stick around and help her out. To exact their revenge on Cassie for her meddling ways, the townsfolk force her to marry Angel- which ends up being little hardship as Cassie sees to his lonely noble heart and he\u2019s decided she\u2019s gotten better looking with every passing day. It\u2019s when her parents- who\u2019ve only talked to each other thru Cassie for years- show up, that things get turned awry\u2026 and Cassie and Angel not telling each other their true fears about romantic relationships, doesn\u2019t help either.Angel takes off soon after, believing he\u2019s not good enough for Cassie, and Cassie- though incredibly hurt- lets him leave. Still, being who she is, she cant let it completely go. She resolves to find Angel\u2019s missing parents. Which of course she does.sighAnother sweet, quirky romance from the Dowager of Romance. These oldies by Lindsey read so easily and charm every time. Even on 100th re-read."}, {"userName": "Gail", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6208297-gail", "userReview": "My favorite book in this trilogy."}, {"userName": "UniquelyMoi ~ BlithelyBookish", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1113032-uniquelymoi-blithelybookish", "userReview": "Kindle Sale!
