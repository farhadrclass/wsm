If you've read it, you know it's a masterpiece, and anything I say is irrelevant. If you haven't read it, I'm faced with the daunting task of persuading you that it's worth your time to get through it. Not only is it 12 volumes long, but everyone calls Powell the English Proust. Why read some inferior Proust wannabe when you can get the real thing?The above notwithstanding, if you are the kind of person who likes long novels, you will probably find Dance an unforgettable trip, irrespective of whether or not you have read Proust. I have read both of them more than once, and, although there are similarities, there are also huge differences. Let's start with the style. Proust, of course, is famous for those incredibly long sentences, but, try as I will, I can only bring myself to be half-enthusiastic about them. OK, every now and then you are stunned by the syntactic elegance and perfect balance. Rather more often, unfortunately, it feels more like a really impressive Jenga tower: you are amazed that it can stand upright, but everyone has to tiptoe around the room as long as the game is in progress. Proust readers will all be familiar with the maddening phenomenon of being close to the end of a 500 word sentence when something interrupts your train of thought, and you have to go back to the beginning, losing 15 precious minutes that you will never see again. In a perfect world, the police would regularly check GoodReads, and divert noisy traffic away from the Proust readers who'd asked for this service; even with Obama coming in, it's not going to happen any time soon. Powell's sentences are satisfyingly long and elegant, but he doesn't go to the absurd lengths that Proust does, and you can for example read them when small children are playing in the vicinity.Still on style, I hope will not offend the hard-core Proust fans when I say that he's not usually that funny. There are of course comic passages, some of them very good (I'm particularly thinking of the Duchesse de Guermantes and all her witty remarks). But on the whole, the tone is quite gloomy. So, when reading Proust, not only do you have to make sure you're alert and not being distracted, you also shouldn't be feeling too down. One begins to see why it's significantly harder to reach the end of Le Temps Retrouv\u00e9e than, say, the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Dance, in contrast, is basically a comic novel; it's amusing most of the time, in a very dry, understated English way that definitely grows on you as the story progresses and the author builds up more and more possibilities for complex irony based on the past histories of the characters. If you're still thinking of it as basically like Proust, you may have trouble believing me, but I assure you that Powell can cheer you up when you are unhappy. It's that different.Moving on to content, another major difference is that Powell characters inhabit a world that recognizably has some connection to the one most of us inhabit. In Proust, no one has anything as mundane as a job, and people spent most of their time attending fancy parties, agonizing about whether they can arrange to be presented to members of the French nobility, appreciating immortal works of art, and getting laid at houses of ill repute. (I really liked Jessica's comment that SHE wanted to have that kind of life. If only!) A lot of Powell's characters are from the English upper classes, but they do mostly end up working for a living, getting married, having children, and doing other things readers will find familiar. You aren't constantly having to apply your internal cultural translator, and figuring out what the thing Proust is talking about might correspond to in your own dull, bourgeois existence.I'm sorry if this review has so far has a defensive tone, but I've been saving the really good stuff for the end. The thing that makes Dance brilliant rather than just very good is the character development, which is simply unequaled in any other novel I have come across. Usually, when the novelist wants the reader to significantly change the way they see a character over the course of the book, he has technical problems because he needs to fit it all into the three to five hundred pages he has at his disposal. Hence all the tiresome foreshadowing that so often spoils the book, and makes it seem so unlike real life. (I love Christina Ricci's comments about foreshadowing at the beginning of The Opposite of Sex). Because Powell is working on such a huge canvas, he can do without all that crap. The first time you meet Stringham, he is so funny, charming and witty that, just like the narrator, you are completely bowled over. He does perhaps seem a bit impulsive and irresponsible, but that is all part of the charm. Similarly, Widmerpool first comes over as a complete idiot. In retrospect, one does wonder whether it really was so funny for Stringham to make a prank call that got his teacher arrested, and you also see that the absurdly over-earnest way in which Widmerpool sorts out the quarrel over the tennis match at the French pension pointed towards something. But Powell's touch is so light that I never suspected anything at the time. The next time you see them, you are just a little surprised that Stringham seems to have become rather thoughtless, but you ascribe that to the exhalted social circles he moves in; and when you see that Widmerpool has landed himself a better job than you expected, you don't really pay much attention to it, particularly after he, once again, manages to cover himself in ridicule by knocking over his employer's flower pots while reversing his car. It's only when you've got many hundreds of pages into the series that it starts coming together. Stringham is drinking far too much; it's not funny any more, at least not most of the time. Widmerpool, on the other hand, suddenly has acquired some real power, without you quite being able to see how it happened. This is exactly how you experience it in real life. Some of the people you worshiped when you were a teenager have turned out to be hopeless failures; others, whom you laughed at, have somehow become very successful. You can't quite reconcile the two views: some of the time, you accept them at their new value, and some of the time they still seem like morons. Powell succeeds perfectly in presenting all these contradictions, without ever seeming even to work up a sweat. It just flows naturally from the narrative.Well... I probably still haven't managed to convince you to read Dance. But think about it :)"}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/236411-steve", "userReview": "As an unrefined youth (up until last year or so) when someone said Jane Austen\u2019s novels were all about manners, I\u2019d wonder how it was she could have filled whole books with talk about fork placement and ballroom protocol. It finally dawned on me that they must have meant manners in a broader sense \u2013 prevailing customs, ways of living \u2013 that sort of thing. ;-) If my new interpretation is indeed correct, I can state with confidence that this collection of twelve Anthony Powell classics is also all about manners. The setting is England between the wars where stylized manners abound. Plenty is happening, of course. Mutation both within and between classes is de rigueur. The narrator, Nick, is somewhat upper-crusty in a semi-Bohemian way. He\u2019s not a bad sort, really; just a tad slower than we are to recognize romantic turns and new social orders. As a narrator he\u2019s not so much unreliable as he is resistant to the tides of change. Nick has a good education as well as a novelist\u2019s eye for detail. He\u2019s great at observing quirks and he describes them well. We quickly get to know the three other central characters through Nick\u2019s powers of observation. They all went to the same top school (Powell himself was an Eton chap) where the patterns were set early. Nick\u2019s friend Stringham was the brash aristocrat, their friend Templer was the raffish womanizer, and their colleague off to the side, Widmerpool, was both oafish and ambitious \u2013 an awkward combination. A whole host of other characters played supporting roles. Each one was described with care and sometimes with a bit of fun. For instance, Nick said of his Uncle Giles: \u201cHe was also habitually unwilling to believe that altered circumstances might affect any matter upon which he had already made up his mind.\u201d Someone else was said to have \u201ctransmitted one of those skull-like smiles of conventional friendliness to be generally associated with conviviality of a political sort.\u201d In fact, much of the collection that I\u2019ve read so far (the first 3 of 12 volumes comprising what they call the First Movement) seem like character profiles and dialog tied together not by plot but by dinner parties, art shows, and dances. The people come in all varieties: twits, ditzes, toffs and cads among them.The writing is lush; teeming with commas and semicolons. On average, there\u2019s one more clause per sentence and two more words per clause. Once you tune your ear to it, though, it sounds pretty good. Strike that. With Powell\u2019s command of the English language, \u201cpretty good\u201d doesn\u2019t pass muster. It\u2019s filled with little aphorisms, too. For example: \u201cBeing in love is a complicated matter; although anyone who is prepared to pretend that love is a simple, straightforward business is always in a strong position for making conquests.\u201d In the main, the humor is like a fine claret \u2013 subtle, dry, and well-balanced. There\u2019s a reason the Modern Library listed it as the 43rd best novel in English in the 20th century and Time Magazine included it in their top 100 English-language novels from 1923 to 2005. Since I\u2019m only a quarter of the way through the series, I can\u2019t comment yet on the full epic sweep. It extends into the 60\u2019s. Evolution is inevitable, if not revolution. There\u2019s a fabulous documentary film series that began in the early 60\u2019s in England. It started with a cross-sectional profile of 7-year-old kids from all different backgrounds called 7 Up. Seven years later they returned to these same kids as 14-year-olds to see how they\u2019d changed. Was their future foretold? How had they changed? They\u2019ve repeated the process every 7 years since, so far up to 49. It was fascinating to see how their lives turned out \u2013 their professions, their relationships, their worldviews \u2013 sometimes as you\u2019d expected, other times not. Anyway, Powell\u2019s series has that same potential. I\u2019ll report back later once I\u2019ve read more."}, {"userName": "Tea Jovanovi\u0107", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3103000-tea-jovanovi", "userReview": "Po ovom serijalu knjiga, snimljena je i sjajna britanska serija...

The twelve volumes of Powell's Dance was really one of the reading highlights of my life.I've written a few words to review Powell's first season of the dance, Spring, more than once. The earliest version had a personal note in it, something like the reconstruction of it as I now recall, which occasioned Comment 1 below:About ten years ago I was in the process of reorganizing the books in my library. I ran across the four seasons of Powell's Dance, didn't really know what they were, but just put them in the place they should be and continued on. I think I figured they were just more novels I'd acquired at some point and never read, like many others.After joining Goodreads a few years later, I happened to see Manny's review of Powell's masterpiece. Not too long after I read \"Spring\". What impressed me immensely about those first three novels was Powell's idea of bringing out the way in which, as we dance our way through time, we only gradually come to know more and more about friends and acquaintances, often in very curious circumstances - a flash of insight caused by someone's casual remark. This struck me as such a beautiful comment on the way people go through life.A bit later, I got curious about how I had got the books. I offhandedly said something about them to my wife, and she said that they were her books, and that she'd read them. I was stunned. Right now, relating this late at night, with her asleep upstairs, I can't ask - and I can't imagine when she would have read twelve novels by Powell. It seemed utterly out of character for her. She was a scientist, hardly ever read books (novels) for pleasure, read newspapers, scientific journals, but novels??? Twelve by one author?And, I should point out, at that time we'd been married at least forty years, and I'd known her since we were five years old. That was the experience that occasioned comment #1 below.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Previous review: City David MacaulayRandom review: Invitation to the Dance that's this dance!Next review: Pablo Picasso A RetrospectivePrevious library review: A Dance to the Music of Time the whole thingNext library review: At Lady Molly's #4 in the series"}, {"userName": "notgettingenough ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2658311-notgettingenough", "userReview": "I\u2019ve been somewhere tonight that Ant has never been and frankly, I\u2019m thinking maybe he\u2019s right. Maybe it\u2019s better to discuss how posh people lay the cutlery for dinner parties than life at the bottom. And I have only myself to blame. [Much, much later: the rest of this entry has been cut on the grounds that it is crap, even by the standards set here]And, as usual, I hope it is understood that a review of A Dance to the Music of Time can be about absolutely anything.------------------------------------------------------------------------Really, this is no more than an apology. Throats cut, Lebanese men with big knives, Penelope what's her name. I realise this review is in danger of becoming interesting. Might I calm things down with the information that it is 44C here where I live just now. Too hot to cut throats, wave knives about, or care what nationality your neighbour is. Too hot to sleep. Too hot to do anything but be exceedingly dull on goodreads. You are welcome to vote for me if you sincerely think I've been boring enough.-----------------------------------------------Oh dear, I can't resist.So, one of the things that happens in A Dance to the Music of Time is that the narrator mentions a lot of completely obscure books, whether or not they were so at the time of reading, I don't know. Like, what is the point of my telling you here that I'm reading  An Iron Rose? Then moving on to explain that I am doing so in my LBD at The European while eating Turkish eggs and drinking tea. I confess I think I was especially irked because I tried to catch him out with his dates, so I'd look up all these books to see if any of them had come out at a time that contradicted the story line, and they don't. Yes, we seem to have established that I'm that petty-minded.Later on in the day I went to see Broken Embraces, so I know now what Penelope what's her name looks like. I guess you need to be a boy to get the full rise from that. The movie could have done with a good looking man, but considering it was Spanish...So, my LBD, had a full day of it, posh restaurants, a film, and then tea at the Windsor while we discussed how great Australia is and what the fuck do those Indians know anyway? No offense, any Indians reading this but India is a country where the value of human life is virtually nil. People are killed every day for pure fancy. They are killed because they are women, because they are poor, because they are from the wrong part of town and yet apparently Australia is this incredibly racist place because an Indian was murdered here the other day without being robbed. Like Australians aren't killed for kicks? I think they are. I used to collect statistics on women killed in India by their husbands and mother-in-laws. It is generally done by dousing the wife in petrol and then setting them alight. Some of these poor women don't actually die. Shaking my head. Get your own house in order, please, India.Meanwhile, I gather that England has been so cursed by the need to be politically correct that my sister-in-law tells me this story. They are sitting in a London restaurant with their daughter and son-in-law. The people at the next table see Sarah say 'I'll fucking kill you, you fucking Jew. If you don't stay away I'll fucking kill you.' Sarah is brandishing a knife while saying this. Now, the reason is that she is telling the never ending saga of the Lebananese restaurant owner next to their apartments. He most certainly isn't particularly anti-Jewish, he has threatened them all with knives and other tasty Lebanese treats, some involving stuffing - the Lebanese do like to stuff things. Martha and John completely freaked out. Evidently this was enough to get them arrested, Sarah telling this story. Racist tensions much be an awful thing to live with in the UK, but fortunately in Australia everybody still gets on in a natural way without having to legislate racial harmony.All of which brings me back to  An Iron Rose. Might this segment of my review of  A Dance to the Music of Time conclude with an archetypical description of some Aussies playing footy in the bush. This is Australia.pp. 61-63Ten minutes into the last quarter, it began to rain, freezing rain, driven into our facts by a wind that had passed over pack ice in its time. We only needed a kick to win but nobody could hold the ball, let along get a book to it. We were sliding around, falling over, trying to recognise our own side under the mudpacks. Mick Doolan was shouting instructions from the sideline but no-one paid any attention. We were completely knackered. Finally, close to time, we had some luck: a big bloke came out of the mist and broke Scotty Erwan\u2019s nose with a vicious swing of the elbow. Even in the rain you could hear the cartilage crunch. Scotty was helped off, streaming blood, and we got a penalty.\u2018Take the kick, Mac,\u2019 said Bill Garrett, the captain. He would normally take the kick in situations like this, but since the chance of putting it through was nil, he thought it best that I lose the game for Brockley. \u2018Privilege,\u2019 I sad, spitting out some mud. \u2018Count on my vote for skipper next year. Skipper.\u2019I was right in front of goal but the wind was lifting my upper lip. I looked around the field. There were about twenty spectators left, some of them dogs sitting in old utes.\u2018Slab says you can\u2019t do it,\u2019 said the player closest to me. He was just another anonymous mudman but I knew the voice.\u2018Very supportive, Flannery,\u2019 I said. \u2018You\u2019re on, you little prick.\u2019Squinting against the rain, I took my run-up inot the gale, scared that I was going to slip before I could even make the kick.But I didn\u2019t. I manged to give the ball a reasonable punt before my left leg went out under me. I hit the ground with my left shoulder and slid towards goal.And as I lay in the cold black mud, the wind paused for a second or two and the ball went straight between the uprights.The final whistle went. Victory. Victory in round eight of the second division of the Brockley and District League. I got up. My shoulder felt dislocated. \u2018That\u2019ll be a slab of Boag, Flannery,\u2019 I said. \u2018You fucking traitor.\u2019\u2018Brought out yer best,\u2019 Flannery said. \u2018Psychology. Read about it.\u2019I said, \u2018Read about it? Psychology in Pictures. I didn\u2019t know they\u2019d done that.\u2019Paul, I've been called to dinner. I trust you will proofread this.-------------------------------------------------------------------In deference to Paul.p.196 'This was an unnpleasnt surprise for everyone. The girls could not have made more noise if they had been having their throats cut.'Now, this really did make me think. In my opinion the girls certainly could not have made more noise if they had been having their throats cut. But this is not what Ant means. Ant means that he considers one would make a lot of noise while having one's throat cut. More noise, perhaps even, than Manny would make if anybody actually gave him a vote for his review of Go book number two. I have to say, I've spent quite a bit of time thinking about this. I considered googling it, but I'm fairly sure that I'd get taken somewhere I really don't want to be. I'm not talking about Manny squealing with delight, I'm talking about the girls with the cut throats, of course.My own sense of what would happen is that the loudest noise during this process would be that of blood hitting a hard surface. Or maybe the sound of 'shit' as the blood meets the clothes of the throat cutter. The cuttee, nup, surely silent.Then, just this morning, as I'm eating sourdough baguette toast and tea at my local French coffee shop I come across the following scene in An Iron Rose p. 138He'd been killed where he lay, his head pulled back by the ponytail and his throat cut. More than cut. He was almost decpaitated.....Carlie mance was in the bathroom, naked....the man had been behind her when he cut her throat....Now this is merely inferential, but. The place has been staked out by the Feds, it is tapped for sound. There is no doubt that if these people had made so much as a squeak while having their throats cut, the Feds would have been right onto it.I rest my case.--------------------------------------------------3.30pm I cruise into the kitchen, not unnnoticed.'What are you doing?''Looking for lunch''But you had lunch half an hour ago'I hate people who count your food. Hate, hate, hate. And I feel sure I said somewhere on goodreads just a day or so ago that I haven't hated anybody ever, but let's just exclude people who count your food out of that rash statement.'You can't have another lunch now just because that book is making you miserable'.And it is true. Absolutely true. I didn't even want the first lunch I had. I certainly don't want this one. But.I feel like I've given this book more chances that Jesus gave all humanity. I wouldn't care to speak for him, but for me, I'll say too many. Way, way, way too many.I keep thinking that I will nail my case here by quoting a really really really boring passage. But what to choose? Honestly dip in anywhere and prepare to be bored to death by pompous formal writing of a kind I'm gobsmacked got into print. p.250At school I had known Tom Goring, who had later gone into the Sixtieth, and, although we had never had much to do with each other, I remembered some story of Stringham's of how both of them had put up money to buy a crib for Horace - or another Latin author whose works they were required to render into English [fucking hell, why oh why this tedious qualification. Are we going to find the narrator out? Ah ha. YOU said it was Horace and actually:] - and of trouble that ensued from the translation supplied having contained passages omitted in the official educational textbook. This fact of her elder brother having been my contemporary - the younger son, David, was still at school - may perhaps have had something to do with finding myself, immediately after our first meeting, on good terms with Barbara; though the matter of getting on well with young men in no circumstances presented serious difficulty to her.Sorry if that had you on the edge of your seat.I formally throw in the towel. I've done my hundred dollars. Bugger.-----------------------------------Later.If you happen to have read this book you will understand that digressions are the essence of the thing. So, it is in this spirit that I mention I went to Brightstar and I make a note to myself never to shag Keats should he come across my path. I take note that he's dead these days, but I can't see that this detail will make him less lively. In fact, make that poets fullstop. Pop poet on your profile, send me a little something about the affinity you feel for - some body part or another, my mind, even, if you like - and I promise I'll stay well clear.And I go to bridge and somebody asks me if I know anybody with influence in the city and a big house. The whole passing acquaintance with an academic who might live near Cambridge just hasn't really done it for me. So, I've got a better approach now. 'Well, Bob of course. And Jeff...' And there is nothing the other person can say to that. They are in terrible danger of showing inexcusable ignorance if they get pursue the details of this claim. Honestly it works.And our young wanker, - well, Manny thinks otherwise, so does that mean it's the author who is a wanker - narrator spends two pages of such tedium describing the process of thinking about kissing somebody and then kissing entirely the wrong person, honestly, truly, you don't want to know, that I revise my opinion about Brightstar. I have to admit that I would shag Keats dead or alive (him, not me) rather than the earnest sad little sod who fancies himself as a writer in this First Movement. Maybe you have to have been a young man sometime in your life to fancy him. Maybe you have to care about money and influence and big houses. I just don't know.At bridge certain interesting things happen, but I shan't tell you about then since it would be against the spirit of this book to pep you up that way. So, I will merely mention that my partner forgot a baby bit of system on board one, leaving us in the wrong game (which I made) rather than the right slam. And the very next board my opponent failed to understand the simple truth that aces are not necessarily highest. Hmm. That last point is almost philosophically interesting. I beg your pardon.-----------------------------------------------------------------Later. At dinner, Gowers asks me whom I know with a big house and an important position in the City. Panic. Are there no names I can drop, anybody of note I know? Will I be invited back here again? Umm, I reply after a frozen moment, I know an academic I believe lives near Cambridge. Gowers sniffs. But do you know any Oxford academics, Gowers replies, in those two words sweeping away the entire concept of there being academics outside that institution. Of course! My own niece lives in Oxford with her husband who is an academic there. I lean back in relief. Not to be invited back to the Gowers, well, the shame of it. Gowers is pleased.Donald changes the subject. Any good practical jokes lately? He describes his mother in a nursing home. He turned off her TV at the powerpoint and she spent an entire day thinking her TV wasn't working. It was such a hoot. That prompted Andrea to say she was thinking of moving the newspaper her 94 year old mother gets delivered to the edge of the stairs. Wouldn't it be hysterical if the old bint fell down the stairs while attempting to retrieve the paper? We all smile at the prospect.Then I woke up. This is what comes of reading First Movement before bed. The subject matter of the book to date, as you can see, is gross. Nasty boys with nasty values doing nasty things. One might hope they grow up except that the rest of the cast to date are nasty adults with nasty values doing nasty things. This book has a mighty lot of characters in it so far, but not one that is likeable.One wonders if it is the author or the narrator who is a wanker. Well, obviously the narrator is a wanker in a literal sense, he is a young man. But intellectually, metaphysically? Are we supposed to be appalled by the entire thing? Would I have a different understanding of this book if I lived in a country like England where social status is so important that one can write hundreds of pages about it without being either offensive or dull?And please God, could you not lighten up a bit, Ant? Could we not have a knock knock? An I say I say I say? So it's Sunday, I'm going to have tea and toast for breakfast soon at one of my favourite coffee shops. I was going to wear my NYE party frock today, but it's too cold. Sorry cute LBD. You have to wait again. Next I'm going to be playing bridge all day and coming back to whereever I'm staying right now. Then I'll be cooking dinner or I will have dinner cooked for me.And anything, absolutely anything is a review of A Dance to the Music of Time.------------------------------------------------------------------So, it's New Year's Eve, I had three parties I promised to go to - come as a celebrity, Marta said; you mean other than a famous writer, I ask? Marta is Hungarian, she didn't get it - a gorgeous new dress, the sexiest heels...and what am I doing?I'm writing about A Dance to the Music of Time: First Movement. The bloody thing's twenty-eight hundred pages long, I don't have time for parties. You might say, you are so not doing that, writing about this book, but hey, I'm learning on my feet while I'm reading Powell. Pithy he is not. To the point? Hardly. I'm reading Les Miserables as well right now and frankly, Ant - I hope he wouldn't mind my being intimate, I'm going to be with the guy for two thousand eight hundred pages, I don't see how to avoid getting too close to him - well, Ant makes Victor Hugo look like he's on a word diet. He makes Hugo look like he's on a bet, just how short can you make this book. And to his credit, Hugo takes a quarter of the space Ant does. Maybe he collected.Having stated that this book is about a certain Myriel, the first sentence of Les Miserables reads:Although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate, it will not be superfluous, if merely for the sake of exactness in all points, to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese.The first sentence of Ant's testament to the English language, if we might compare, reads:The men at work at the corner of the street had made a kind of camp for themselves, where, marked out by tripods hung with red hurricane-lamps, an abyss in the road led down to a network of subterranean drain-pipes.What happened to sucker your reader in with your first sentence? What happened to 'It was love at first sight'? Oh. Joseph Heller was still on his way.I guess the fact is that you don't want to give too much away in your first sentence when you have about - hmm, let's see, 2800 pages, say a dozen sentences to a page, that's 33,600 sentences to go.

Notably, Powell attended Eton at a time when several other talented writers were there, including Eric Blair (a/k/a George Orwell), Cyril Connolly and Henry York (Henry Green). Jenkins is as much an observer as he is a participant, and rarely the center of attention. Instead, he gives focus to the lives, growth and aging of his closest three classmates and paints on a huge canvas his and their dance with thirty-two other characters who join and leave and rejoin. The sequence captures in a way I've not seen in any other work how time alters the players by introducing them, then bringing them back at a later time, and then takes them away again, ultimately all of them--some with violence and in war and some quietly--and the reader--this one at least--is knelled by the impermanence of life and its permanence (it goes on). The primary trio includes the boorish and ambitious Kenneth Widmerpool (one of the most memorable, despicable characters drawn in any literature I've read), the blue-blooded and self-destructive Charles Stringham and the self-assured and worldly-wise Peter Templer. He brilliantly composes each of the thirty-two supporting characters with such prismatic particulars that I can recall most of them now, a year out from reading the cycle. The primary beauty of the four movements is watching these characters waltz in with an ease that can only be imagined by a writer on his game pouring his soul into the works.The novels are each relatively short, a bit over 200 pages, a few less, and were published between 1951 and 1975. I am so glad I threw away my fear to plunge into the Dance.This work is hard to figure the best way to review. It is 12 novels, 4 movements, and I fear giving too many details will scare some potential readers away. I will supplement my review to address the separate works (likely by the 4 movements) individually."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa", "userReview": "I thought of Plato's Cave during the very first page. I was reminded of Brideshead Revisited as Nick the narrator visits the home of a friend with a rich mother (admittedly, that's based on superficialities). I couldn't help but think of M. Swann while reading of Nick's childhood memories of Mr. Deacon: the child had heard his parents discuss the man and he thus becomes a \"mysterious figure\" to the narrator.I realize I'm not catching many of Powell's literary and painterly allusions.I hope to have more of substance to say as I read on (nine more books to go!), especially, as in the last of this set, I was greatly enjoying the meta-fictional musings of Nick/Powell on the writing of characters: Nick wondering how he'd write of an English person (such as his friend Mark Members) versus characters who aren't British (such as the family Nick's observing in the Ritz), which of course Powell has written. I'm also very interested in how many more people Nick will compare to his Uncle Giles."}, {"userName": "David Lentz", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3604115-david-lentz", "userReview": "A \"A Dance to the Music of Time\" may well be one of the great literary works about the everyday life of the upper class in England and those attempting to break into it or rise within its social ranks. The writing is excellent, of course, but I rarely found myself transported by this work of meta-fiction about social climbing and high society, for example, in the same way in which Proust does. Powell is often considered an English Proust as the focus of the writing has to do with life and striving among the English upper crust. However, Proust strikes me as the far superior writer insofar as Proust is able to build a rhythm and cadence in the pure narrative beauty of his elegant syntax. Powell seems to want us to be amused by rather silly even juvenile plot points and I found it difficult to become immersed in or even to like an epic cast of characters of sycophants and a pretentious landed gentry so rapt in petty materialism and social score-keeping to extend beyond their own thin veneer of human artifice. That is also part of Powell's message but it's a theme which becomes laborious and redundant and boorish in its interminable length. Maybe it's because I'm American and am not compelled to engage in or to understand the complex nuances of the social class system of England. For me, life is too short to become further invested in reading another 2000 pages of more movements. I did very much appreciate Powell's uncommon use of the dance as a metaphor for life itself. Powell sees life as a dance during which we move over time in a series of movements. This idea intrigues me and the scenes of the novel often engage music and dance in the story line. I also became sensitive to and appreciative of the transitions or specific movements as the characters navigated among each other and their society. It is an important aspect of this novel to enable the reader to step back and view life this way. The novel begs the question: how well do you manage to navigate through the movements of your life over time in your business, family and society? Life can be measured in a sense by one's existential agility in moving attuned to the music of time. The ethereal concept of recognizing the partnership of music and time also proved interesting insofar as the constructs of music entail so many existential qualities in measures, stresses, beats, points-counterpoints, orchestration, creativity, individual talent, volume, scale, instrumental ability, discipline, improvisation, listening, expression, nuance, subtlety and grace all of which accompany one's personal dance throughout a lifetime. I became attuned to Powell's transitions among the many scenes he depicts and the vast number of characters who served as dance partners in the music of the narrative. So this is definitely a great literary read and even if in my view Powell may fall short of Proust, so what? They're both great literary novelists, not mutually exclusive, and one can over a long life read both if one starts at a sufficiently early age on the task. Given the choice, I would recommend reading all of Proust first: I'm glad I read this movement in time in order to become more attuned to my own danse macabre."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\u201cWisdom is the power to admit that you cannot understand and judge the people in their entirety.\u201d \u2015 Anthony Powell, A Dance to the Music of Time: 1st Movement The First Movement (**SPRING**) contains the following three novels: 1.

the termination of a given passage of time...the hidden gate goes down...and all scoring is doubled. This is perhaps an image of how we live. For reasons not always at the time explicable, there are specific occasions when events begin suddenly to take on a significance previously unsuspected; so that before we really know where we are, life seems to have begun in earnest at last, and we ourselves, scarcely aware that any change has taken place, are careering uncontrollably down the slippery avenues of eternity.\"So this year I decided to read Anthony Powell's epic series A Dance to the Music of Time. It took me a while to slog through the first volume, though not because it's not good. It's just very long and not at all the sort of plotty novels I usually like. At times it's Dickensian in its understated, dry social commentary combined with over-the-top, just barely plausible characters, but Powell has a much subtler touch than Dickens and his novels are more realistic, his characters more believable. His messages also are delivered with much more elegant, one might even say delicate, prose. At the same time, he made me laugh even more than Dickens does.This volume combines the first three of the twelve books that make up the series: A Question of Upbringing, A Buyer's Market, and The Acceptance World. Together they cover the early adulthood of the main characters. The first-person narrator, Nick Jenkins, remains the most stable and sensible of the crew, though he is certainly not without his flaws. He becomes quite unbearably pretentious for much of the second book, in the manner of all young men who think they have life all figured out at age twenty-something. His friends are Peter Templer, a playboyish sort of rascal, and Charles Stringham, the tragic romantic with too much family money to take life seriously. There is a fourth member of the central \"quartet\" who is distinct because he's not really friends with any of them, yet seems to be a recurring presence in their lives: Kenneth Widmerpool, the awkward mediocrity they all remember as that kid they laughed at for being obtuse, ingratiating, and a natural figure to poke fun at.A Question of Upbringing covers their school years at an Eton-like boarding school, introducing us to the quartet of boys and several other characters who will recur, such as headmaster Le Bas and Nick's Uncle Giles, a cagey, self-absorbed, money-seeking old bastard who is that irritating relation you can never quite shake off.\u201cLater in life, I learnt that many things one may require have to be weighed against one's dignity, which can be an insuperable barrier against advancement in almost any direction. However, in those days, choice between dignity and unsatisfied curiosity was less clear to me as a cruel decision that had to be made.\u201dA Buyer's Market introduces Nick to the world of sex and marriage (though he does not get married himself any time in this volume). Nick spends most of his time dawdling about in a publishing job, eventually becoming a writer himself, and hanging out at debutante balls, presumably with the goal of eventually landing a wife, though he doesn't really seem to be in a hurry. The book opens with him being \"in love\" with a rather flighty and temperamental woman who is apparently juggling a number of suitors, including our old friend Widmerpool. Widmerpool plays his usual role as comedy relief by getting a bowl of sugar dumped on his head, the entire incident described in exquisite physical and emotional detail, and at the same time, his reaction is another clue (we've had a couple of previous ones) that he's really not someone you should be quick to laugh at.This isn't the only intersection of Jenkins and Widmerpool's professional and romantic lives; the book moves through some encounters with artists, socialists, and other people one might best describe as \"social facilitators\" whose precise role in life in never made explicit but whom everyone who is anyone seems to know.I should note here that Anthony Powell is actually quite funny, even though he never writes straight-up humor. But that sugar bowl incident is both funny and strangely disturbing. There are also many amusing observations made throughout the series, mostly delivered in Nick's wry voice:\u201cHe gave me a look of great contempt; as I supposed, for venturing, even by implication, to draw a parallel between a lack of affluence that might, literally, affect my purchase of rare vintages, and a figure of speech intended delicately to convey his own dire want for the bare necessities of life. He remained silent for several seconds, as if trying to make up his mind whether he could ever bring himself to speak to me again; and then said gruffly: 'I've got to go now.\u201d\u201cFeeling unable to maintain this detachment of attitude towards human- and, in especial, matrimonial- affairs, I asked whether it was not true that she had married Bob Duport. She nodded; not exactly conveying, it seemed to me, that by some happy chance their union had introduced her to an unexpected terrestrial paradise.\u201dYou can also see Nick's dry sense of humor in his conversations with Stringham and Templer and some of his other friends. He slowly begins to take himself less seriously, while figuring whom he should take seriously and whom he shouldn't.The Acceptance World brings us to the end of Nick's early adulthood and we can readily see that it marks the beginning of his transition to real adulthood. He's becoming established as a writer, while a subplot in this book is a contretemps between a best-selling novelist of uncertain reputation, St. John Clarke, his current secretary, Mark Members, a poet, and J.C. Quiggins, a Marxist writer who seeks to supplant Members. This entire subplot is brilliant in all the unspoken inferences about the relations between these men, the personal and professional jealousies and petty maneuvering for prestige, and (at least I took it this way), the fact that one could read between the lines and suspect this was a romantic rivalry as well. (Powell does allude to homosexuality several times, but mostly in a jocular fashion, and it's not clear whether any of the characters will really turn out to be gay.)And at last, Nick Jenkins is finally caught up in a true love affair of his own, not just being dangled by a debutante, but engaged in a serious affair with a married woman.\u201cThere is, after all, no pleasure like that given by a woman who really wants to see you.\u201dA Dance to the Music of Time is not exactly exciting reading, but it's great reading when you are in the mood to luxuriate in careful prose that is deceptively deep for its apparent lightness, and get to know characters gradually and in great detail. After finishing the first volume, I am gaining an appreciation for Powell, and my motivation for continuing the series is not so much \"What's going to happen next?\" as \"Show me more writing like this.\" It's really a book that is just full of quotable quotes, but sometimes it's the longer passages that strike you with the genius, the poignancy, the insight, or the understated humor. And I just know Widmerpool is going to prove to be some sort of dire lynchpin. As volume one ends, we are entering the 1930s, and already there are references to Mussolini and fascists, so while much of the first three books took place in the shadow of World War I, we can see foreshadowing of the war to come.Maybe I am being a barbarian in only giving volume one 4 stars, because the writing is absolutely top notch. But I place a big value on story, and I want to see where the arc goes. Also, honestly, Powell did teeter on the brink of long-winded self-indulgence at times. I know, I know, the story isn't the main thing here, but to merit 5 stars (making it a \"favorite\"), Powell has to satisfy me all the way to the end. I may revisit this rating after I finish the series, and I plan to read the next three volumes this year."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4542979-kim", "userReview": "A Dance to the Music of Time is a twelve-novel cycle examining English society from the 1920s to the 1960s through the lives of its predominantly upper middle class characters, which is presented as the memoirs of the narrator, Nick Jenkins. The cycle is broken into four \"movements\", consisting of three novels each. This, the first movement, is comprised of A Question of Upbringing, A Buyer's Market and The Acceptance World. The title is a reference to Nicolas Poussin's painting of the same name, which is housed at the Wallace Collection in London. Nick Jenkins explains the significance of the painting at the beginning of the first novel: These classical projections, and something from the fire, suddenly suggested Poussin's scene in which the Seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. The image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure, stepping slowly, methodically sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognisable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps, to control the steps of the dance.Time \u2013 how it passes, how people interact and alter with its passage - is what the work is about. It\u2019s unlikely to appeal to readers who want an action packed, plot driven novel. However, readers who favour intelligent prose, a large cast of well-developed characters* (many of them based on real people) and interesting social history over plot will be amply rewarded. I was prompted to listen to the audiobook version of this novel, which is superbly narrated by Simon Vance, after learning that the Tory Anthony Powell was a close friend of the socialist George Orwell, as well as a fellow Etonian. If not for reading a biography of Orwell, I may never have tackled Powell, even though the audiobook had been sitting around on my computer for quite some time. I\u2019m glad I did and I\u2019m looking forward to listening to the Second Movement. *Okay \u2013 well-developed male characters: the women are rather less interesting."}, {"userName": "Adriana Scarpin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3233112-adriana-scarpin", "userReview": "A verdade \u00e9 que todas aquelas salsichas e bananas espalhadas na cara (!?!) do in\u00edcio de A Question of Upbringing me fez lembrar do quanto gosto do ch\u00e1 com bolo do pequeno Marcel.

Originally comprising 12 separate novels published from 1951 to 1975 it now comes in four volumes and I\u2019ve only read the first volume so far, but I am hooked. Sometimes compared to Proust\u2019s A La Recherche du Temps Perdu (Remembrance of Lost Time), Anthony Powell\u2019s masterpiece might also be called a comedy of manners. It is much easier to read than Proust, and not just because the sentences are shorter: it\u2019s more amusing, less angst-ridden, and the \u2018Britishness\u2019 of its subtle ironies is part of its charm.A clumsy summary might make this work seem like a soap-opera, so I shan\u2019t try except to say that the novels follow the fortunes of a group of young men through their adolescence and adulthood, from the immediate post WW1 period to the early 1970s. It begins when Jenkins, Templer, Stringham and Widmerpool are in the same house at Eton, and it moves on as they muddle their desultory way through and out of university and then into careers of one sort or another. They muddle into and out of relationships too: love, business, artistic and so on. Along the way there is a veritable cavalcade of eccentric and sometimes dubious characters from all walks of life.To see the rest of my review please visit http://anzlitlovers.com/2012/01/22/a-..."}, {"userName": "Bette", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1809172-bette", "userReview": "I have very mixed feelings about this book. On the one hand, Powell gives a highly detailed picture of English life between the wars for a certain class of men. And some of it is quite funny. On the other hand, it was incredibly slow moving (though listening to large parts of it dramatized the book more than reading it). Nicholas Jenkins, the protagonist of the book, is very passive, more an observer than a truly well-rounded character. And his views of women are condescending and derogatory. I don't think that I've ever encountered such sweeping and ridiculous generalizations about the so-called \"fair sex\" in a novel, and I've read a lot of 18th and 19th-century lit. Jenkins's (& Powell's, presumably) views of women are quite misogynstic. I'm glad I read the first movement, having heard about the book many years ago and having been curious about it. But I will not read the remaining 9 novellas. I think I'll try the BBC miniseries!"}, {"userName": "Nigeyb", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10301421-nigeyb", "userReview": "\"A Dance to the Music of Time\" is a twelve-volume cycle of novels by Anthony Powell.

The slowly developing narrative centres around life's poignant encounters between friends and lovers who later drift apart and yet keep reencountering each other over numerous unfolding decades as they move through the vicissitudes of marriage, work, aging, and ultimately death. Until the last three volumes, the standard excitements of old-fashioned plots (What will happen next? Will x marry y? Will y murder z?) seem far less important than time's slow reshuffling of friends, acquaintances, and lovers in intricate human arabesques.\"Time and Anthony Powell: A Critical Study by Robert L. SeligBelow is a review of each of the three novels that are contained within \"Spring\".* * * * *1. A Question of Upbringing (Volume 1): I've wanted to read \"A Dance to the Music of Time\" since discovering that Julian Maclaren-Ross features somewhere in the series as a character called X. Trapnel. Such is my interest inJulian Maclaren-Ross (I am, of course, assuming you have already read \"Fear and Loathing in Fitzrovia: The Bizarre Life of Writer, Actor, Soho Raconteur Julian Maclaren-Ross\" by Paul Willetts) that this is sufficient to inspire me to tackle one of the longest works of fiction in English literature. You probably feel exactly the same. If you don't then you should consider it.Published in 1951, \"A Question of Upbringing\" is the reminiscences of Nick Jenkins (presumably based on Powell himself) who recounts his last few years at public school around 1921, a summer spent in France, and then onto university. It's a familiar world of gilded privilege, akin to the early sections of \"Brideshead Revisited\", though with very little by way of drama or narrative. Instead the reader is introduced to a variety of disparate characters and some prescient anecdotes. I say prescient as Jenkins hints at the ways in which their lives will turn out.What makes this book a delight is the beautiful writing, which really captures the era and milieu, and which is aligned to regular doses of humour. Powell captures the transition of adolescence into adulthood perfectly: the insecurities, the naivety, the fast changes, the gaucheness, the way friendships may evolve and fracture, and how life choices made at this stage can shape whole lives.I suspect this series will get better and better and \"A Question of Upbringing\" lays the groundwork for what it is to follow. I cannot wait to find out. 4/5Click here to see my review of A Question of Upbringing (A Dance to the Music of Time #1)* * * * *2. A Buyer's Market (Volume 2): \"A Buyer's Market\" is the second book in Anthony Powell's twelve novel sequence \"A Dance To The Music of Time\" and it picks up the narrative in 1928, via a flashback to Paris where narrator Nick Jenkins introduces us to an artist called Mr Deacon.Nick is now in his early twenties and whilst more grown up, still uncertain of his place in the world. I assume this explains the book's title. Nick and his contemporaries are searching for money, jobs, sex, social status etc. and their search takes them to a succession of social events that Nick recounts in the same first hand manner of \"A Question of Upbringing\". Also, in common with \"A Question of Upbringing\", it's full of day-to-day detail and Nick's perception of those he encounters.How reliable is Nick as a narrator? He frequently revises his opinions about those he meets not least Widmerpool whose personal journey continues apace. The narrative technique adds to the sense of surprise and gives the book a few memorable twists. For me Widmerpool is very much the star of the show and I love the way he kept turning up in ever more incongruous and unexpected places - constantly surprising and confounding Nick Jenkins.There are also, and again in common with the first book, some moments of sublime humour, and much of the exquisite writing has a pleasing and playful tone.I enjoyed this book every bit as much as \"A Question of Upbringing\", and now look forward to reading the third instalment, \"The Acceptance World\".Reading the first two instalments of \"A Dance To The Music of Time\" has been an absolute joy and akin to the pleasure of slipping into a hot bath. I recommend both books and eagerly anticipate completing the journey from 1914 to 1971 - and discovering what happens to Nick and his group. 4/5Click here to see my review of A Buyer's Market (A Dance to the Music of Time #2)* * * * *3. The Acceptance World (Volume 3): Ten years on from the start of A Question of Upbringing, which starts with narrator Nick Jenkins recounting his last few years at public school, The Acceptance World begins in London in 1931. The recurring characters have all undergone significant change. Some that seemed to have the world at their feet have squandered their gifts, whilst others who were more pitiful in their younger incarnations are enjoying success.The economic gloom that characterised the 1930s seems to permeate this part of \"A Dance to the Music of Time\", despite this, The Acceptance World is supremely enjoyable.This volume introduces a hint of mysticism, a new character called Myra Erdleigh tells Nicks fortune through the ancient practice of cartomancy (reading ordinary playing cards) and, later in the story, there is an incident with a planchette. I'd never heard of them before but apparently planchettes came to prominence in the years following the establishment of Spiritualism in America in the mid-nineteenth century, kick starting a craze for supernaturally tinged parlour games, s\u00e9ances etc. that must have continued into the early 1930s (probably with a resurgence after World War One).The Acceptance World is certainly the most dramatic volume so far, with a merry-go-round of relationship change. Almost as soon as two disparate characters meet there's a likelihood of a change in relationship status in the offing.As I work through the series it is becoming clearer how some of what happens in the early stages, sets up the Dance as we move forward in time. This is making the series progressively more enjoyable, rewarding and compelling. I raced through The Acceptance World such was the pleasure it gave me. I've enjoyed all of the first three volumes however this has been the most enjoyable so far.I encourage anyone who starts the series, and is unsure about whether to commit, to stick with it. It becomes ever more enjoyable and rewarding.My other tip is to refer to AnthonyPowell.org where there are lists that help the reader to keep track of who is who, along with a synopsis of every volume, and interesting and insightful essays. 5/5Click here to see my review of The Acceptance World (A Dance to the Music of Time #3)"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth (Alaska)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2026178-elizabeth-alaska", "userReview": "First posting 6/11/2014 for A Question of UpbringingSecond posting 7/29/2014 for A Buyer's MarketFinal Posting 8/19/2014 for The Acceptance WorldThis edition includes the first three books of the 12-volume series. I'll \"review\" them individually, as that is how I'm reading them.A Question of Upbringing introduces us to who I assume will be the four main characters throughout the series. It is told in the first person by Jenkins (first name as yet unknown) and begins in \"about the year 1921.\" The \"boys\" are apparently in the last years of public school. Widmerpool is at least a year older than Stringham, Templer, and Jenkins. Each has sufficient family resources to be in public school, but the differences are apparent.There is not much plot, just a telling of life as it happens. I don't expect the series to be very deep, nor especially emotional, but a very pleasant read being the times and lives of just the sort that appeals to me.A Buyer's Market tells us the narrator is Nicholas \"Nick\" Jenkins. That might have been in the first story and I missed it. The boys are now definitely men and out in the world. I think these will just be a pleasant interlude to heavier reading. I think they are on the 1001 list because of the insight into this wealthier class of people in the years between the wars and a way of life that probably no longer exists.The Acceptance World is the final installment in this first 3-volume book of the series. I feel as if I'm settling into Nick Jenkins telling his story. He makes observations about people - and he knows a lot of them. Their personalities are varied. They are mostly people who are somewhat affluent, or come from affluent families. His characters try to keep up the appearance of affluence, even when they no longer have any real hope of being such. This story takes place in the Depression, or the slump. Jenkins is a writer - yes, this is semi-autobiographical - and his contacts for the most part move in the world of letters and art.I'm giving it 4 stars at this point, but I think it resides at the lower part of that group. I look forward to the rest of the series, although I may have to lay it aside for a few months."}, {"userName": "Gary Lee", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/996286-gary-lee", "userReview": "This contains the first three novels of Powell's cycle.A Question of Upbringing -- 4 out of 5 stars.This first novel, of the overall twelve novels involved, comes across as little more than a high(er)-brow version of A Seperate Peace. And to me, that's not a bad thing. It's quite readable, if a bit dry in places, and manages itself very well.It's essentially the first (230page) chapter of an overall novel that spans the life of the main character; so, this time is spent introducing the character, as well as detailing certain important bits of his adolescence and young adult life. Not much more. There are eleven more novels to fill in the rest.I think that's where most readers get annoyed. If one comes to each novel in this cycle, expecting a definite beginning/middle/end structure, they won't really find it. While each book is able to stand on its own, it's the entire cycle that is meant to be read as one single (very long) novel.A Buyer's Market -- 4/5 starsA bit more involved and engaging than the first novel.This second novel finds the main character (and subsequent supporting characters) a few years older, and not much wiser. They've now finished with University and are starting to make their first appearances in the London social scene. That's about it for this one -- as with the previous novel, this one follows episode after episode of Jenkins' young adult life, but only going from one social episode to the next -- one party or weekend outing after another.One character is introduced in the first chapter, dead in the last chapter.There's a questionable abortion -- questionable in that it might have been a scheme for money.Homoerotic overtone, heteroerotic overtones -- it's all here. Just as in life.The Acceptance World -- 5/5 starsThe first two novels set everything up -- the major characters, themes, motifs, history, mythology, etc. And now, Powell starts to get into the beginning of the heart of the narrative. The characters are now taking jobs, marrying, having affairs, divorcing, becoming drunks, becoming major players in society, becoming social revolutionaries -- in part, they're growing older and finally interacting with the world around them.I'm quick to write this one off as the best novel of the three collected in this first volume, but I'm not sure if it's because it actually is the best of the three or because I've become familiar with all of the main characters and have become interested in their lives and interactions.Starting 7/1/08, I'm giving myself one year to make it through Powell's cycle.We'll see how it goes..."}, {"userName": "Timothy Hallinan", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1619829-timothy-hallinan", "userReview": "My favorite novel of the 20th century is probably Anthony Powell's twelve-volume marathon, A DANCE TO THE MUSIC OF TIME, written between 1951 and 1975. Supremely civilized, enormous in design, an unforgettable picture of a way of life (and a class) that were disappearing even when Powell was one of the \"bright young people\" who were so visible in the 1920s in London, the books that make up Dance are also very funny.I first read DANCE when I was in my early thirties, and the story (in the first three books) of the friendship of three boys thrown together in school and the gradual dissolution of those friendships as the world calls the young men in different directions, meant a great deal to me at the time. I'd never read anything that seemed to speak so directly to my own life. This was emphasized by the loss, in the book, of one boy -- the most brilliant one -- into a life of drink and another into sexual dissipation that ruins his relationships and irremediably coarsens his character. I had watched several friends hit the rocks by that time and had sailed pretty close to them myself.The remaining books chronicle the irresistible rise of the boy the others had scorned, the implacable Widmerpool, who amasses power almost as revenge for being unloved and unliked, and who demonstrates a resilience to humiliation -- even sexual humiliation -- that's almost mythical in scope. I think Widmerpool may be the fictional creation I most admire. By the way, Powell's four-volume memoir, TO KEEP THE BALL ROLLING, also speaks to a level of civilization that seems today to be as lost to us as Atlantis."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/222151-ed", "userReview": "This and the other four volumes are actually a total of 12 novels following a welter of British characters from 1914 until the mid 1960s.

I guess I find it closer to life as it was lived in the 20th century and certainly to the idea of our lives as a dance that characters keep returning to, in different changing guises, mirroring society's evolution as well as their personal characters.In Widmerpool Powell has created an awesomely representative villain whose growing evil is perfectly understandable given his starting point and what happens around him. Though memorably someone once said: 'we are all someone's Widmerpool': someone thinks us evil in some way. And he has one of my favorite tragic characters: Charles Stringham.

For Powell, the author, to build the social and political settings for the novels which follow, it took hundreds of pages before I began to feel an engagement with characters. This being said, Powell has tremendous insight into the complexities of love and human psychology. In addition, his allusions to literature, art, and the politics, society, and economics of the early 20th century British Empire, in order to build a rich context which influence his host of characters, is uncanny.  Powell has been compared to Dickens. Having just read several Dickens novels in the past year, there are indeed a number of similarities, in both their ability to tell a story stemming from the unique perspective of one individual, and their attention to details, in all regards. The protagonist of this story, Nick Jenkins, is the narrator. At one point he states: I began to brood on the complexity of writing a novel about English life, a subject difficult enough to handle with authenticity even of a crudely naturalistic sort, even more to convey the inner truth of the things observed. Jenkins, as well as Powell were masterful in their narratives and observations. In addition he observed: But, in a sense, nothing in life is planned--or everything is--because in the dance every step is ultimately the corollary of the step before: the consequence of being the kind of person one chances to be. In the novel, Jenkins's job is to write about art. Out of all his acquaintances, he is the least ambitious. His power, only known to the reader of his thoughts, is to observe how each step his associates and friends make, creates a distinctive, yet misunderstood, portrait of themselves as individuals: mortal: imperfect: vulnerable. As his friends, acquaintances, and associates drift in and out of his life, he carefully documents the \"movements\" in their professions, relationships, and behaviors. This is the fascinating aspect of story. Nick is not judgmental. Affairs are spoken of as though he is talking about brushing lint off of his shoulder.  Powell handles descriptions of intimate liaisons in a discreet, ingenius manner.  There were times I read paragraphs two or three times, in an attempt to ingest his maxims and to marvel at his acuity of thought.****************************************************************************************************************************************************With POWELL, as with WOOLF, there are not only favorite quotes, there are favorite PASSAGES:These classical projections, and something in the physical attitudes of the men themselves as they turned from the fire, suddenly suggested Poussin's scene in which the Seasons, hand in hand and facing outward, tread in rhythm to the notes of the lyre that the winged and naked greybeard plays. The image of Time brought thoughts of mortality: of human beings, facing outward like the Seasons, moving hand in hand in intricate measure: stepping slowly, methodically, sometimes a trifle awkwardly, in evolutions that take recognizable shape: or breaking into seemingly meaningless gyrations, while partners disappear only to reappear again, once more giving pattern to the spectacle: unable to control the melody, unable, perhaps to control the steps of the dance.He had his being, like many others, in obscurity.The latter's boast that he had never read a book for pleasure in this life did not predispose me in his favour.It is not easy---perhaps not even desirable--to judge other people by a consistent standard. Conduct obnoxious, even unbearable, in one person may be readily tolerated in another; apparently indispensable principles of behavior are in practice relaxed---not always with impunity--in the interests of those whose nature seems to demand an exceptional measure. That is one of the difficulties of committing human action to paper, a perplexity that really justifies the alternations of comedy with tragedy in Shakespearian drama: because some characters and some deeds...may be thought of only in terms appropriate to themselves, irrespective of their consequence. On the stage, however, masks are assumed with some regard to procedure: in everyday life, the participants act their parts without consideration either for suitability of scene or for the words spoken by the rest of the cast: the result is a general tendency for things to be brought to the level of farce even when the theme is serious enough. This disregard for the unities is something that cannot be circumvented in human life; though there are times when close observation reveals, one way or another, that matters may not have been so irreconcilable at the close of the performance as they may have been in the Second Act.It was an article of faith with him that all material advancements in the world was the result of influence, a mysterious attribute with which he invested, to a greater or lesser degree, every human being on earth except himself. That the rich and nobly born automatically enjoyed an easy time of it through influence, was, of course, axiomatic; and --as society moved from an older oder---anybody who might have claims to be considered, at least outwardly, of the poor and lowly was also included by him among those dowered with this almost magic appanage.It is not unusual for people who look exceptionally robust, and who indulge in hobbies of a comparatively dangerous kind, to suffer from poor health....I suddenly became aware in acute degree, tempered by the realization, which came much later, that such feelings...marked development in transmutation from one stage of life to another.Being in love is a complicated matter; although anyone who is prepared to pretend that love is a simple, straightforward business is always in a strong position for making conquests. In general, things are apt to turn out unsatisfactorily for at least one of the parties concerned; and in due course only its most determined devotees remain unwilling to admit that an intimate and affectionate relationship is not necessarily a simple one: while such persistent enthusiasts have usually brought their own meaning of the word to something far different from what it conveys to most people early in life. At that period love's manifestations are less easily explicable than they become later: often they do not bear that complexion of being a kind of game, or contest which, at a later stage, they may assume.This was probably an unjust charge, because [he]...was not a man to put himself easily in the wrong. In any case, circumstances had equipped him with such dazzling opportunity for pursuing his preponderant activity of interfering in other people's business that only those who failed to grasp the extent of his potentiality in his own chosen sphere would expect--or desire--him to concentrate on a pedestrian round of tutorial duties.[He], himself who was aware that in a society showing signs of transition it was essential to keep an eye on the changing focus of power.I had never previously met him, but I had seen him and knew his name well, because he was one of those persons who, from their earliest years, are marked down to do great things; and who so often remain a legend at school, or university, for a period of time after leaving the one or the other: sometimes long after any hope remains, among the world at large, that promise of earlier years will be fulfilled.As you know, Pleasure before Business has always been my motto... ( Character response) PLeasure can be so exhausting.It was possible that, in...[his] eyes, money represented some element in which he knew himself deficient: rather in the same way that [ another character] , when he wanted to criticize...said that he had too much money: no doubt in truth envying the possession of assets that were, in fact, not material ones.There are certain people who seem inextricably linked in life; so that meeting one acquaintance in the street means that a letter, without fail will arrive in a day or two from an associate involuntarily harnessed to him, or her, in time...It is as if the tempo altered gradually, so that too violent a change of sensation should not take place; in this case, that some of the atmosphere of school should be reconstructed, although only in a haphazard fashion, as if for an amateur performance, in order that I should not meet [him] in his new surroundings without a reminder of the circumstances in which we had first known one another.This was the last I should see of [him] for a long time. The path had suddenly forked. With regret, I accepted the inevitability of circumstance. Human relationships flourish and decay, quickly and silently, so that those concerned scarcely know how brittle, or how inflexible, the ties that bind them have become...A new epoch was opening: in a sense this night was the final remnant of life at school.The canvases...[t]hey made me think of long forgotten conflicts and compromises between the imagination and the will, reason and feeling, power and sensuality; together with many more specifically personal sensations, experienced in the past, of pleasure and pain....[N}othing establishes the timelessness of Time like those episodes of early experience seen, on reexamination at a later period, to have been crowded together with such unbelievable closeness in the course of a few years; yet equally giving the illusion of being so infinitely extended during the months when actually taking place....{I}f I considered him at all as a recurrent factor, I should have been prepared to admit that he might crop up again. I did not, however, as yet see him as one of those symbolic figures, of whom most people possess at least one example, if not more, round whom the past and the future have a way of assembling.I found myself wondering whether, so far from loving her, I did not actually hate her.{She} never touched strong drink, in spite of behavior that often suggested the contrary.Certain actions take place outside the normal course of things so unexpectedly that they seem to paralyse ordinary capacity for feeling surprise...It would, indeed, be hard to over-estimate the extent to which persons with similar tastes can often, in fact almost always, observe these responses in others: women: money: power: whatever it is they seek; while this awareness remains a mystery to those in whom such tendencies are less highly, or not at all, developed.On the contrary, inconsistency in his own line of thought worried him scarcely at all.Simple--like all great ideas.He was again showing recklessness in giving voice to these spasmodic outbursts of worldly knowledge....I reflected on the difficulty of believing in the existence of certain human beings...even in the face of unquestionable evidence--indications sometimes even wanting in the case of persons for some reason more substantial to the mind---that each had dreams and desires like other men...If a clue to that problem could be found, other mysteries of life might be revealed.I used to imagine life divided into separate compartments, consisting for example, of such dual abstractions as pleasure and pain, love and hate, friendship and enmity; and more material classifications like work and play: a profession or calling being, according to that concept--one that seemed, at least on the surface unequivocally assumed by persons...dissimilar from one another...something entirely different from 'spare time'. The illusion--as such a point of view was, in due course, to appear--was closely related to another belief: that existence fans out indefinitely into new areas of experience, and that almost every additional acquaintance offers some supplementary world with its own hazards and enchantments. As time goes on, of course, these supposedly different worlds, in fact, draw closer. if not to each other, then to some pattern common to all; so that, at last, diversity between them, if in truth existent, seems to be almost imperceptible except in a few crude and exterior ways: unthinkable as formerly appeared any single consummation of cause and effect. In other words, nearly all in the inhabitants of these outwardly disconnected empires turn out at last to be tenaciously inter-related; love and hate, friendship and enmity, too, becoming themselves much less clearly defined, more often than not showing signs of possessing characteristics that could claim, to say the least, not a little in common; while work and play merge indistinguishably into a complex tissue of pleasure and tedium.If certain individuals fall in love from motives of convenience, they can be contrasted with plenty of others in who passion seems principally to be aroused by the intensity of administrative difficulties in procuring its satisfaction.I felt that, if we could avoid seeing each other for long enough, any questions of sentiment...could be allowed quietly to subside, and take their place in those niches of memory especially reserved for abortive emotional entanglements of that particular kind.Perhaps intimacy of any sort, love or friendship, impedes all exactness of definition...In short, the persons we see most clearly are not necessarily those we know best.I was far from understanding that the capacity of men interested in power is not necessarily expressed in the brilliance of their conversation.A sense of maturity, or at least of endured experience, is conveyed, for some reason, in the smell of autumn.[She] is an excellent specimen of middle-class female education brought to its logical conclusions...She couldn't be more perfect even if she had done to the university. Her head is stuffed full of all the most pretentious nonsense you can think of, and she is incapable---but literally incapable---of thought. The upper class and lower classes can sometimes keep their daughters in order---the middle class, rarely, if ever.Funerals make one's mind drift in the direction of moral relaxation--though it's unaccountable to me the way intimate relations between the sexes are always spoken of, and written about, as if of necessity enjoyable or humorous. In practice they might much more truly be described as encompassing the whole range of human feeling from the height of bliss to the depths of misery....{H}interlands are frequently, even compulsively, crossed at one time or another by almost all who practice the arts, usually in the need to earn a living; but the arts themselves, so it appeared to me as I considered the matter, by their ultimately sensual essence, are, in the long run, inimical to those who pursue power for its own sake. Conversely, the artist who traffics in power does so, if not necessarily disastrously, at least at considerable risk.Nothing in life can ever be entirely divorced from myriad other incidents; and it is remarkable, though no doubt logical, that action, built up from innumerable causes, each in itself allusive and unnoticed more often than not, is almost always provided with an apparently ideal moment for its final expression. So true is this that what has gone before is often, to all intents and purposes, swallowed up by the aptness of the climax; opportunity appearing, at least on the surface, to be the sole cause of fulfillment. There is a strong disposition in youth, from which some individuals never escape, to suppose that everyone else is having a more enjoyable time than we are ourselves...At the same time there was an area of common ground where disparagement of other people brought them close together, if only on account of the ammunition with which each was able to provide the other: mutual aide that went far to explain a friendship long established.For reasons not always at the time explicable, there are specific occasions when events begin suddenly to take on a significance previously unsuspected; so that, before we really know where we are, life seems to have begun in earnest at last, and we ourselves, scarcely aware that any change has taken place, are careering uncontrollably down the slippery avenues of eternity.Dedicated, it might well be asked, to what? The questions would not be easy to answer. Dedicated, perhaps, to his own egotism; his determination to be--without adequate moral or intellectual equipment--absolutely different from everybody else.People can only be themselves...If they possessed the qualities you desire in them, they would be different people.Those interminable latter days of the dying year create an interval, as it were, of moral suspension: one form of life already passed away before another has had time to assert some new, endemic characteristic. Imminent change of direction is for some reason often foreshadowed by such colorless patches of time.I began to brood on the complexity of writing a novel about English life, a subject difficult enough to handle with authenticity even of a crudely naturalistic sort, even more to convey the inner truth of the things observed....{A}n inexorable law governs all human existence in that respect, ordaining that sooner or later everyone must appear before the world as he is. Many are not prepared to face tis sometimes distasteful principle. Indeed, the illusion that anyone can escape from the marks of his vocation is an aspect of romanticism common to every profession.I had not thought of her for ages, though some small residue of inner dissatisfaction, that survives all emotional expenditure come to nothing, now returned.But, in a sense, nothing in life is planned--or everything is--because in the dance every step is ultimately the corollary of the step before: the consequence of being the kind of person one chances to be. There is always a real and an imaginary person you are in love with; sometimes you love one best, sometimes the other. At that moment it was the real one I loved. I reflected, not for the first time, how mistaken it is to suppose there exists some \"ordinary\" world into which it is possible at will to wander. All human beings, driven as they are at different speeds by the same Furies, are at close range equally extraordinary.I wondered why he and his wife did not get on better. It was extraordinary that he seemed to please so many girls, and yet not her.Such a taste is hard to justify.Pictures, apart from their aesthetic interest, can achieve the mysterious fascination of those enigmatic scrawls on walls, the expression of Heaven knows what psychological urge on the part of the executant.Just as well he's passed away...In any case I always think an artist is rather an embarrassment to his own work.Emotional crises always promote the urgent need for executive action, so that the times when we most hope to be free from the practical administration of life are always those when the need to cope with a concrete world is more than ever necessary.But description of a woman's outward appearance can hardly do more than echo the terms of a fashion paper. Their nature can be caught only in a refractive beam, as with light passing through water: the rays of character focused through the person with whom they are intimately associated.Women can be immensely obtuse about all kinds of things...but where emotions are concerned their opinion is always worthy of consideration.I thought of love, which from the very beginning perpetually changes its shape: sometimes in the ascendant, sometimes in decline."}, {"userName": "Michael Battaglia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17248131-michael-battaglia", "userReview": "It's difficult to write about this series without mentioning Proust at some point, so I might as well get it out of the way now. It's probably not a coincidence I'm reading this series not long after finishing a certain doorstop of a translated French novel, for one thing they stack really nicely together and if you're browsing in a well-stocked bookstore they're shelved conveniently near each other thanks to the last names being very similar. It doesn't take long for the eye to wander from the shelf devouring Proust behemoths to the equally epic looking series of Powell novels and perhaps wondering, \"Which one should I read?\" And in case you're wondering if I'm overstating this slightly, at least two pull quotes from noted authors or critics on my edition of this volume distinctly compare it to Proust (implying that it's better, frankly, although Evelyn Waugh is kind of on record as not being that fond of Proust in the first place), so it's almost like they expect you to draw comparisons. Geez, as if the fact that both works are gigantic as all heck isn't enough.Honestly, it's really two different experiences, not completely dissimilar but akin to standing outside of an aquarium and watching the fish go by instead of being utterly dunked inside the tank to let the whole ocean envelope you. I'm early yet into Powell's epic but the almost suffocating thematic weight and laser-beam like focus on the internal crises of the narrator that distinguish Proust aren't quite on display here yet (let's remember that I'm only a quarter of the way through, it may be a bit of a slow burner). The concepts of Time and mortality and memory and how we're the sum of the intersection of all those forces are felt more strongly in the Frenchman's work and despite the narrator's weirdly obsessive quest to prove that every woman in Paris is a lesbian, you come away from that work feeling like you know what makes him tick, even if some of that understanding just wants to make you slap him. And that's going to be my last Proust/Powell comparison. At least in this review, I can't make any promises for the future.Still, the pleasures here are much more immediate and go down far easier, eschewing sprawlingly complex sentence structures for ones that human beings can actually reach the end of in their lifetimes, but maintaining a vocabulary level that would make your high school English teacher weep with joy that you got to use all the words she taught you. Powell has a smooth and easy style, along with a light touch that makes everything delightfully digestible and while some people label these as comic novels, it's not so much a comedic tone as delicately prodding, the narrator skipping over events with a refined and witty eye. There's very few lines that made me laugh out loud and there's nothing explicitly harrowing here but there are moments when you can see the start of things that could go to very dark places later.What is it about, though? Four lads that we first meet at school in the wake of World War One. While all the adults are still properly shellshocked around them for experiencing what they'll consider for a little while the worst mankind has to offer, our narrator Jenkins and his three friends (or two friends and one sort of persistent hanger-on) navigate their way not just through the post WWI/pre-WWII years of British high society but also the thorny paths of becoming adults, with all the expectations and dreams colliding in ways that don't always work out. And meeting girls. Many, many girls.A couple things make the structure interesting, at least for people who wonder how someone can write what is essentially a three thousand page novel that doesn't quite bog down under its own weight or disappear up its own rear. For one, Jenkins is clearly narrating the tale some years down the line, and often makes references to future events or that he won't see people for years at a time, which gives a sense of the scope of this affair. It's not clear that we're actually leading up to anything other than \"My life is a series of lessons on how my friends refuse to make smart decisions) but it does helps reinforce the epic quality (even if it's more \"hey, we're at another party\" epic and not \"ancient knights and warlords\" epic), despite those events being decidedly mundane. In true Dostoevsky fashion, the boys can be divided into their basic human elements, for those who like charting the vaguely satirical nature of their progress through life. And the tone has that particular British melancholy that they might as well to bottle and sell in shops for pale, lonely boys who are true poets on the inside, with the narration leaping without warning into some lyrical insights, sometimes giving the impression that what is superimposed on the narrative are two overlapping concerns, a young man so in the moment that he can't ever imagine being old, and an old man desperately attempting to imagine what it was like to be young.But for the most part, the plot resides in a rambling and vaguely episodic series of events as Jenkins pilots his way through life somehow convinced that even though he's telling us the story we don't need to know anything about him except what he tells other people. In true epic novel fashion, a good chunk of events are spent at parties and sometimes the book seems to be a chronicle of the incidences where Jenkins runs into people he knows over the years, no matter how coincidental it seems to be after a while (London's a small town after all, wot?). There are points where you can't quite tell if he is stalking fellow former classmate Widmerpool (by far the novel's most finely sketched character) or vice versa, since they don't even seem to like each other that much. He plunges through his life like the slow trickle of an ice water leak, drifting every so often back into the orbits of his former schoolmates, like checking in with old friends to see how successful they've been, or time has already started to ravage them.It would make for a very even reading experience, like a smooth drink that barely leaves behind any hint of a burning sensation, if not for the huge cast of characters that Powell creates to populate his fictional world. Not only are there Jenkins' classmates but a quite varied assortment of characters, from old uncles to artists to Communists to old authors to women of dubious virtue, all of whom are delineated with a painter's eye and make the book come alive in a way that reading about the five hundredth high society party Jenkins attends and barely affects events can manage. Even the characters that only appear for brief stretches liven the book up, whether it's Jenkins' uncle popping in like some sitcom guest star, or the strange lady who may or may not have psychic powers. Powell's ability to cram these people in the novel and not have them fight each other for superiority, where they have space without sucking up all the oxygen, is a pretty remarkable feat and while I may have trouble remembering some of them come book twelve, it gives Powell an endless combination of scenarios to concoct, even if the basic setting is more or less the same (and despite some dips into a vaguely middle-class pool, we're hanging out in Gatsby territory here). The only character that comes close to stealing every scene he's in is Widmerpool, whose intense focus on himself to the exclusion of all else makes him like a model for Ricky Gervais' character on \"The Office\", unaware of how ridiculous he comes across but utterly serious in his aims. In fact, he probably wouldn't even care if he realized how he came across (there's a hilarious scene toward the end of the novel where he gives a completely inappropriate political speech and when someone has a stroke in the midst of it, seems more put out that he couldn't properly finish).It's those and other scenes (a Communist march where Jenkins witnesses an unexpected attendee is another standout) that surface throughout the novel that give us the feel of real life, the dry comedy that exists underneath the seriousness, or the desperation that sometimes underlies the comedy (you can almost see the horror in \"any girl that moves is fair game\" Templer's eyes as he tries not to contemplate what he'll be like in fifty years). It may be a real life where you seemingly run into the same twenty people over and over again but it's that's dance the title of the series refers to, where you can lose yourself in the rhythm and flow of it, until somebody trips and you suddenly look around, still caught in the dance but suddenly very aware of how much everything can change, especially when you're not looking."}], "description": "A Question of Upbringing, A Buyer's Market, The Acceptance WorldAnthony Powell's brilliant twelve-novel sequence chronicles the lives of over three hundred characters, and is a unique evocation of life in twentieth-century England.
