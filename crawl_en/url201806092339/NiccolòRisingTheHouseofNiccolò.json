Dunnett has absolutely no patience with lazy readers. The plot is very complex and she doesn't coddle: you read closely, or you will be lost. It's amazing, really, (and heartening) that these stories are so popular and widely read in a day and age where people seem to lean toward the easier options available to them.Second, I don't mind being a little confused and having to read slowly or even to re-read, because there are riches here to be enjoyed. She writes like a Brueghel painting: there's so much going on, you have to dedicate all your attention but when you do, you'll be amazed and rewarded.This is, of course, historical fiction. The Niccolo series starts out in fifteenth century Bruges, which was the capital city of Flanders and today is widely considered to be the best preserved medieval city in Belgium. The main character, Claes, is introduced as an awkward, good natured, good looking eighteen year old with a penchant for getting himself and others into trouble, for romancing housemaids, and mostly for surviving the beatings everybody seems to heap on him. But that's just the early impression. Claes (who undergoes a transformation and will be known, eventually, as Niccolo) is about as complex and interesting a character I have ever run into in print.I adore this novel. I would love to set up a wiki and take it apart, sentence by sentence, image by image, historical facts one by one."}, {"userName": "Lightreads", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1836077-lightreads", "userReview": "This is the story of Claes AKA Nicholas AKA Niccolo van der Poele and his meteoric, often painful rise from a dyer\u2019s apprentice to one of the premier businessmen in sixteenth-century Europe. Nicholas is brilliant, hilarious, and possessed of the sort of intellect and drive that are simultaneously intoxicating and very dangerous. He is a dyer, a toymaker, a natural mathematician, a fighter, a shameless cheat, a man of complex and often alarming motivations. He forms the backbone of these books, along with his friends and lovers and enemies, and the stories sprawl out around him to take in Bruges and Turkey and Cyprus and Africa, politics and business and high social drama, hilarity and romance and terrible tragedy.The books are simply brilliant, in the way of writing that grabs you by the throat and the brainstem equally. Dunnett\u2019s command of history is engrossing, her prose tense and precise, her characters crackling. Her writing is impressive because it looks easy \u2013 there\u2019s something so perfectly balanced and poised about these books, as if every word is in the right place, and there to do some work. And they certainly do work \u2013 I laughed, I gasped, I squealed, I sniffled, I groaned. I also paid extraordinary amounts of attention, because not a conversation goes by that doesn\u2019t have at least two layers tucked slyly beneath, horrifying or funny or just illuminating. These books are quite honestly the most intellectually invigorating things I\u2019ve read in years.I have quibbles (hi, I\u2019m Light, and I quibble with books). Dunnett seems to really enjoy a helping of dramatic irony, both in portraying characters who spend a great deal of time wondering and thrashing about disasters the reader already knows about, and in ducking into the heads of people who spectacularly fail to comprehend Nicholas and the tides that move around him. It\u2019s frankly annoying, though I should also clarify this is predictably my least favorite literary device. I was also a bit . . . overwhelmed, by the end of Scales of Gold. Dunnett has a way of punching you in the kidneys in the last four pages, and perhaps it\u2019s that these books are the only fiction I\u2019ve been reading for nearly two months, but by the end the twist of family and revenge and counter-revenge had been amped up to a pitch I found a bit ear-splitting. Baroque is perhaps the word I\u2019m looking for. I couldn\u2019t put these books down, but now I desperately need to read anything else for a long time before I go on. Which is also the sign of incredibly . . . operant literature, come to think of it.Quite the best things I\u2019ve read in years, no exaggeration or caveats."}, {"userName": "aPriL does feral sometimes ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes", "userReview": "\u2018Niccolo Rising\u2019 is a work of narrative genius. If you enjoy that sort of thing, and historical fiction, and a taut dense construction, you will put this book down after finishing with a feeling of amazement and admiration for the author. Dorothy Dunnett, the author, has the kind of intelligence and in-depth education many Ph.D. researchers of European history possess, along with the creativity and awareness of respected MFA Writer\u2019s Workshops\u2019 graduates. (As a grumpy sideways comment, I don\u2019t feel the MFA students of this century have the deeper emotional tones of human beings foremost in their writings, whatever the talent. Many twenty- and 21st-century authors with MFA degrees lean far into Modern or Post-Modern art territory. After some home-schooled explorations on my own, I must add I find the early 18th-century predecessors of and the actual period books described as Modern and Post-Modern literature to be distressingly sterile and dul(l)y compliant of literary deconstruction attributes, even if initially stimulating and superficially intellectual; at least I think so of those I have sampled from the recommended reading lists from recent decades. But I am digressing.)I am certain to hurt feelings or sensibilities in my assessment that the \u2018House of Niccolo\u2019 series (8 books) is for expert readers only, but there I go - I wrote it down anyway. The plot of \u2018Niccolo Rising\u2019 is not easy to follow, or describe, because the novel is a dense story of many threads, with politically-connected characters, many of whom are merchants with many short, seemingly unrelated, discursions on money and goods, much movement around 15th-century European city\\principalities, and the actual aristocratic families which were in control, weaving in actual European history and warfare. In addition, making the book a marvel of construction, there are a multitude of hidden secrets and mysteries woven into the story that are not obvious to the reader until the last 50 or so pages. I only expose this because this series has been around for a few decades, and I think the density of the various plots (and writing) will very likely cause most readers who pick up these books to toss them after a hundred pages or so if not given encouragement to stick out the reading. It is a struggle to get beyond the first half of the book, but the reward of the ending makes it worthwhile. The hero Claes, or Niccolo, won my heart as I saw his real tribulations, gradually revealed, that sprung from a humble beginning, along with his struggles against class and poverty, which were hidden behind a placid accepting smile of dimples and youthful simplicity to which the reader is initially introduced. Niccolo is a polymath, as it turns out, with a strategic genius Napoleon would have envied, along with a charismatic personality and a prodigal memory. The density of the plot matches the mult-dimensional intelligence of Niccolo (and, I suspect, the author), who is only 18 years of age throughout most of the novel. However, despite the taut procedural style of the writing, emotional tones are not neglected, even if often not spelled out. I would say it is a book that could claim \u2018The Three Musketeers\u2019 by Alexandre Dumas as a progenitor.I recommend admirers of The Ice and Fire series (Game of Thrones) give this series a try, but be warned that it is a high-end intellectual sword (no sorcery) historical fiction written by an intelligent educated writer with a serious knowledge of the politics and customs of the late Middle Ages, where it takes place. I think she has a taut and thick procedural-plot style of writing (somewhat similar to police procedurals), though, which eliminated excessive descriptions or the filling in of any gaps of the reader\u2019s knowledge about European history during the Middle Ages. My edition included maps, which are helpful, but honestly, I think a reader has to have more than a passing idea of the wars, personalities and developmental state of European society during the 15th century to be able to get beyond the first 200 pages, as well as an excellent ability to decipher English sentences. I kid you not. The author does not cater to occasional readers or weekend students of history. I thought she had obvious expectations that the reader had better keep up to enjoy the story because she was not going to waste time in extraneous descriptions or explanations. I felt like I did when I graduated with my college programming degree to only later discover that I knew nothing after meeting true techies who had been programming and tinkering with computers since they were children.I intend to read the rest of the series; however, I will stop this series for now to read other books on my shelf. Perhaps as the series progresses the main character\u2019s heroic tendencies may change, I don\u2019t know, but as I believe I can regard myself as a literary reader outside of the (Ivory) Tower, a \u2018wilder\u2019 (readers of \u2018The Wheel of Time\u2019 series will understand), I enjoyed reading this book very much, and I count it as one of my favorites."}, {"userName": "Marquise", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4674014-marquise", "userReview": "It's been a long, long while since I've had to compel myself to read a book till the end, and I don't think it's been one of those times when perseverance is rewarded.The thing with this book is that, whilst it's the trademark Dunnett style of snail-paced buildup that explodes on the very last track of the race course before the finish line, neither the plot nor the characters are worth trudging on for so long (this isn't a small book) unless you like this setting, the theme of merchants, and have an exceptional tolerance for convoluted storytelling.And I don't. I will take any obtuse and cryptic plot anytime\u2014hey, Lymond is ten times harder and I read and reread that series!\u2014so long as I find it compelling, which didn't happen this time. I simply couldn't care less about merchant schemes, dyeshops and clothes and travelling here and there and yonder with a commercial company. Bruges, the main setting, was of little interest as well, and the comings and goings dragged me to such depths of boredom that the occasional spurts of action didn't hold my attention for long, and the twists that were supposed to make this worthwhile by the end came just too late to compensate for the long wait. Yes, I realise that this is Dame Dorothy's style, I am quite familiar with that, she has done this often, and I am sure it'd have been worthwhile if the characters elicited a warm disposition that would at least help, since the plot wasn't compelling on its own.But no luck there either. The characters are perhaps the poorer aspect in the book. Nicholas left me indifferent, I didn't care at all for any of the de Charetty children nor their mother, Katelina was irritating, Gelis was a Philippa wannabe with less charm, the merchant-mercenary troop had none that could hold a candle to the St. Mary men, and Simon . . . It's way too obvious that the antagonist in this series is an idiot.I'd have loved it if at least one of the characters had grabbed my attention, as that would have motivated me to continue. It was what had me continuing with the previous series by Dunnett: I didn't have a good reaction to reading Lymond initially, but there were other characters in the first book that I liked very much and wanted to see again in spite of the main lead, so I continued and eventually came to love the books to bits. Here, neither the plot nor the characters interested me, and I very much doubt I'll pick up another book in this series. I'd heard casual comments before that Nicholas' story suffers greatly in comparison to Lymond's story with some readers that started with the latter first, and in my case it's been proven true."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "[avalanche occurred, and I didn't even care who would survive, (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Sequelguerrier", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6765419-sequelguerrier", "userReview": "This will do for the whole series! Far be it from me to feed anyone's book addiction but have you met Dorothy Dunnett and her Nicolo series? They are historical novels set in late middle age/early renaissance Europe. They centre on the live of group of people in the great trading city of Brugge, then part of the independent duchy of Burgundy. The main character is one Nicholas van der Poele, who rises from the dyeing vats to head a trading house, a bank, a mercenary unit ... and has adventures all over the known world from Burgundian lands to the fall of Trebizond (the last remainder of the Byzantine empire) Scotland (Dunnett's home) via Venice, Cyprus, Africa ... Nicolo is a character worth getting to know, with a rather Byzantine view of the world and of good and bad which gets him into trouble time and again. He is also a greatly attractive character both in the story, he is loved by a whole series of women and men and loves some in return, and for the reader. Historically speaking, Dunnett knows, or rather knew her patch, and I find her world entirely credible including the amazing upward mobility that allowed tradesmen to become princes when the feudal, medieval society started changing. http://www.dorothydunnett.co.uk/ If you get hooked, blame me!"}, {"userName": "Joy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1592683-joy", "userReview": "While expanding my knowledge of Medici Italy in MAGNIFICO, I was reminded over and over of peripheral characters in The House of Niccolo, the Renaissance series by the magnificent Dorothy Dunnett. With Unger as background, I decided, I could revisit this series with a better understanding of Niccolo's world. Was I ever right. :-)And there's Niccolo. Apprentice develops into continental financier: Niccolo, whose many pranks with Felix, heir to the Charetty company, are constantly getting him into trouble and entertaining the city of Bruges. When I say there's much more to Niccolo/ Nicholas / Claes than meets the eye, I give you an image that will still be far too shallow. Through the adventure, drama and mercantile wars of this eight-book series, the central mystery is Niccolo.Dorothy Dunnett was a genius. If her only achievements were her two historical mystery series, House of Niccolo and Crawford of Lymond, she would still be a genius. Read her rich, dense books slowly, because clues are scattered through the text. An emotional reaction that looks like one thing will turn out to have been something else two pages later.

I had finished The Lymond Chronicles earlier in the year and didn't think that this book, or main character would be able to match the level of fascination that I had viewed Francis Lymond.So I was relieved, very relieved to have another worthy character to be involved with. Niccolo vander Poele is quite mesmerising and the plot in this story is as riveting and convoluted as only Dorothy Dunnett can deliver.To my mind it is a marvellous start to the series. The characters are so well drawn and the setting addictive.

Niccol\u00f2 Rising is both a Rube Goldberg machine in itself and the beginning of the even bigger and more elaborate Rube Goldberg machine that is the House of Niccol\u00f2 series. On first read, it's confusing, but the bright side is that every re-read is more and more enjoyable as you come to fully understand the intricacies of Dunnett's world and its people. Niccol\u00f2 Rising charts the ascent of Claes vander Poele, a good-natured, buffoonish, 18-year-old dyer's apprentice and orphaned bastard whose clowning, however, merely serves to hide a brilliant mathematical mind and perhaps more deep-rooted resentment than even he is aware of. Claes uses his talents to attract the attention of various powerful patrons, from his employer the Widow de Charetty to Nicholai Giorgio de' Acciajuoli, of the blood of Athenian princes, to the Medici company itself. He launches a series of risky but lucrative schemes and, by the end of the book, has made his employer's company rich and reduced an enemy's to smoking ruins.In a way, Dunnett's historical novels are mysteries, and the mystery is always \"what the hell is going on?\" Since they're also good mysteries, you always know the answer in the end. The author controls information so carefully that it's almost impossible to guess what's going to happen or what it all means in advance; you have to wait while she pulls away layer after layer, revealing the schemes beneath the mundane business of everyday life, the double meanings behind innocuous conversations, and the twists and vulnerabilities in the psyche of her hero. It's virtuoso writing at its best and damn, is it exciting. Is there anything more fun than reading a Dorothy Dunnett book? Maybe puppies, but there would have to be a lot of them."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11351200-leslie", "userReview": "If Dunnett's Lymond saga was too difficult for you, you should try the Niccolo series...

I don't mean that there is a lot of hidden foreshadowing but almost all the main characters were introduced and the stage was set. I enjoyed seeing how deftly Dunnett showed the evolution of Claes into Nicholas (or Niccolo) and did see what I think were some hints of things to come later in the series. Dunnett's writing is dense and complex so I find it more enjoyable upon rereading.

And Nicholas.After many enthusiastic recs, I read the first book of Dorothy Dunnett's Chronicles of Lymond series last year, and though I found it a rather difficult read at first, it was a rewarding one. An exhausting one too, so I didn't immediately go on to read the rest of the series. While browsing at Bookman though, I saw they had Dunnett's Niccolo Rising, the first book in her \"prequel\" series to Lymond, following Claes, later Nicholas, Vander Poele in 1460 Bruges. I picked it up, and it sat hanging around my room for a while, until I chucked it in my bag to take with me to Big Bear over Thanksgiving. In an idle moment, I picked it up to start reading it, and fifty pages in I couldn't stop.Niccolo Rising does not come off to quite such a damnably difficult and opaque start as Game of Kings does. With Game of Kings, you're scrambling to figure out what in the hell Lymond is up to, if he is who he seems, if he isn't, what the fuck he's even saying because God knows it takes a PhD in Renaissance lit to untangle it all, and what is all this history happening, I don't know anything about Scottish history, etc etc.Claes comes off as rather more easy to understand at first: he's a simple-minded idiot, and he's just let a cannon fall into the canal. Except, he's not simple-minded, and maybe there's something more to this cannon falling into the canal, because he's a Dunnett protagonist, and no series of hers is going to hinge around a simple-minded dyemaker's apprentice who lets cannons fall into canals for no reason. So Claes has to be more than he seems, and it takes reading closely to figure out how at first. The plot of the book essentially charts Nicholas's rise up the ranks of society from dyemaker's apprentice in the Charetty company, to...well, that will spoil it, and as of the third book in the series, he's still rising.The twists and turns of the plot are interesting enough, at least to me: Nicholas has a head for business, and business and economics were inextricably tied to politics in the 15th century. Nicholas's rise mainly centers around money, and earning lots of it while clawing his way up the social ladder. Besides the plot though, it was figuring out Nicholas/Claes that kept me reading so avidly, and it was one exchange early on in the book that absolutely hooked me:\"You do not like the handsome Simon, young varlet? You are jealous, perhaps? He is well dressed, and talks to beautiful demoiselles such as this lady. But he cannot speak Italian, or make children laugh, or be concerned for his friend as you are. Why dislike him?\" The youth Claes considered, his overbright gaze on the Greek. Then he said, \"I don't dislike anyone.\" Adorne said, \"But you hurt them. You mock. You mimic. You offended the lady Katelina yesterday and today.\" The gaze turned on him. \"But they offend me, and I don't complain. People are what they are. Some are harder to pity than others. Felix would like to dress like my lord Simon, but he is seventeen, he will change. My lord Simon is not seventeen, but he acts like an oaf, and has the talents, you would say, of a girl; which must be a mortification to his father. But I think, Meester Adorne, that he does speak Italian, because he made a joke about you in that language. The lady Katelina will remember.\"After watching him play the fool and seem cheerfully oblivious, this is the first bit of the real Claes Dunnett really shows: his brutal honesty and the way he can take people apart. This is Nicholas, who has a rather frightening intellect that's revealed in bits and pieces throughout the book. Nicholas kind of reduces me to flapping my hands. The whole series reduces me to flapping my hands. Because on the face of it, it can seem kind of dry. But trust me, all the business and politics and complex character relationships and hidden motivations come together to form something wildly compelling and engrossing.I feel like I should review the whole series in one go, because as it is I'm still trying to figure Nicholas out. Also, I am in the place where I desperately want things to turn out okay for Nicholas. I am over-invested, okay. And it's not that Nicholas is a woobie-type character, Dunnett is pretty good at bringing him close to ridiculous woobie territory then swerving away from it. One minute it's all \"omg no one understands him and he's weeping quietly and alone from his terrible whipping,\" and then it's \"ho shit did he just orchestrate a byzantine and complex plot to have this dude killed?!\""}, {"userName": "Jerry", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3257074-jerry", "userReview": "The House of Niccolo starts in 1460 in Bruges then moves to the city state of Venice and ends up in Trebizond at the end of the Byzantine Empire. Breathtaking in scope. Thru the 7 books (500 + pages each) you go to all the same places as Lymond does in the Lymond Chronicles but add in Iceland and Mali (as the first white man to make it that deep into the African continent). It follows the title character and his female love interest which is sometimes actual love but mostly revenge trading off between the two of them. Fascinating travelog and nightmare relationships with so many twists and turns your head is spinning.I learned more from her perspective of the Christian vs. Muslim clash than any commentary I have read or heard in today's age. It is also interesting how the 2 series have very different views on this subject due to the time difference and the spread of Islam thru the levant.

I persevered, and was given some tasty bits as a reward, but too few and far between.I appreciate the effort which so obviously went into the writing of this book, and at the same time the surety with which the author considers the reader equally interested in all the details and undercurrents of the story - this surety just puts me off a little. There is too much of it all, so many names, political events and intrigues are supposedly contributing to the story that it's impossible, or rather too tedious to believe in it. I was like, \"all right, Trebizond, King James, the ostrich and the Medici, they all take part in it, oh please hurry with the story, if there is any\".Plus, the main character is cunning, noble, well educated, funny, loved by women and children and slaves, and - I'm sorry to say - has such a modern attitude towards many things (not only him, his friends as well) that I was completely taken aback. I certainly hadn't expected to find so many anachronistic moments and dialogues in such an acclaimed and otherwise well researched novel.

And it's hard for me to express, sometimes in words why. It just speaks to me - literally speaks to my soul. Touches me to the very depths of who I am. Dorothy Dunnett's books are like that for me. They are masterpieces; they are literary art. These books are not easy reads. None of her historical books are - so be warned. These books force you to use your brain. They demand that you respect them - that you SET ASIDE TIME to read them. But here's the thing - if you do respect them, and set aside time to read them, you will be well rewarded. That I promise. For the thing about Dunnett is this: she is a master of historical fiction, (my opinion - the best author of historical fiction of the 20th century - hands down), she is the master of character building, and the psychology of characters - both major and minor, and she is the master at bringing to life the time period in which she sets her stories. These books are about the life of a man. Claus, Nicolo, Nicholas. It begins when he is in his late teens, and goes through his forties. It's about coming from nothing, and making something of ones self. About the choices that are made. About the financial/business successes, the friends, the loves, the loses that shape and form a person. Redemption. A classic story, but told in Dunnett's impeccable style. With humor, and grace, and pain, and always about the main character growing, and learning, and becoming who he is meant to be. It is set in late Medieval Europe, and Africa, and the Middle East. (I did warn you that you'd learn something about the historical time that she is writing about). And I want to add something else. PLEASE, if you think you'd like to read these books - please start with book one. These books are a series of books, where each one builds on the last, both for the story line, and for the character building. Really, it's not the sort of series where you can drop into the middle and get the full sense of the richness of the story. You'll lose the depth of it, the beauty of it. (And I'm tired of reading 1 star reviews where people say they can't understand why people are so in love with Dunnett, when they didn't start with the first book, but the 4th or 5th or 8th even, and wonder why they don't enjoy the story). Sorry, I had to vent a little.So I really do hope you take a chance and read this series of 8 books. And I hope you love them. And I hope you end up loving Dorothy Dunnett as much as I do. And if you haven't read her earlier series of 6 books, \"The Lymond Chronicles\", I hope you read those as well. (They tie into these books).Enjoy!!!!"}, {"userName": "Jean Gobel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11010546-jean-gobel", "userReview": "Thoroughly enjoy this book despite a rather slow beginning. Perhaps slow only because I just finished the last of the Lymond Chronicles, and I'm \"still living in the world of the last book\" which was not the least bit slow! Here we find our hero, Claes, appears to be a clumsy, slow-witted dyer's apprentice who is constantly in trouble, not always of his own making. He has been with the Widow de Charetty's family since he was 10, as servant to her son, Felix. We learn Claes is actually exceptionally gifted in mathematics and organizational skills and with the widow's approval makes changes that benefit the company financially. A war is fought. New contracts are let. A marriage occurs. A heritage is learned. An heir is lost. Claes uses his full name, Nicholas. His dealings with Italy he becomes known as Niccolo. A devastating fire causes havoc. Someone wants Nicholas dead.This is an exciting read. Instead of flying over rooftops in Blois like Lymond, this hero flies the trade and banking routes around Europe on behalf of his company. Travel with him, on one escapade after another.

To me, the humour in the first chapters was overdone to the point of resembling a farce. I found myself confused by the myriad of characters and frustrated in trying to keep them straight in my mind. I had to pause several times and go back to check where I encountered that character and how it was related to the other main characters in the story (there is a scary long character list at the beginning of the book so this aspect was certainly not unexpected). The events taking place are not well explained and the conversations often include subtle statements; it is only pages later that you will realise what happened or the meaning of the earlier words. Dorothy Dunnett writes well but for me was not the easiest of reads. From the number of her fans and the raving reviews on GR, I am positive it is worth making a bit of extra effort with Dunnett\u2019s work but, at the moment, I can\u2019t resist the lure of other books waiting for me.

There are six books and they take place all over, ranging from Antwerp to Morocco, Egypt, Cyprus and more. As in the Lymond Chronicles, the books are meticulously researched, but also have a wonderful story woven throughout in which Niccolo searches for his real family.

E' il primo romanzo della serie di Niccol\u00f2, che consta di otto libri.La Serie di Niccol\u00f2 \u00e8 una serie di otto romanzi storici di Dorothy Dunnett ambientati a met\u00e0 del XV secolo, in pieno Rinascimento europeo. Il protagonista della serie \u00e8 Nicholas de Fleury (Niccol\u00f2, Nicholas van der Poele, o Claes), un ragazzo di nascita povera ed incerta, che arriver\u00e0 alla ricchezza grazie alle sue abilit\u00e0 nei mercati bancari europei e ad intrighi politici internazionali. Le ambientazioni di questa serie sono molto affascinanti e si estendono molto geograficamente per portare il lettore ad ammirare gli importanti centri urbani di Bruges, Venezia, Firenze, Ginevra e la Lega anseatica, la Borgogna, le Fiandre, la Polonia, l'Islanda; la penisola iberica e di Madera, le citt\u00e0 del Mar Nero di Trebisonda e Caffa, la Persia e le isole mediterranee di Cipro e Rodi, l'Egitto e la penisola del Sinai, per finire con l'Africa occidentale e la citt\u00e0 di Timbuktu.Gli otto volumi della saga sono parte di ci\u00f2 che l'autrice ha visto come un grande lavoro di quattordici volumi, che comprende i sei romanzi delle \"Cronache di Laymond\". Quest'ultima \u00e8 stata scritta prima della serie di Niccol\u00f2, ma avviene cronologicamente pi\u00f9 tardi, raccontando la storia dei discendenti dei personaggi della prima serie, nel secolo successivo. Ci sono differenze significative nella approccio narrativo e lo stile di scrittura tra le serie, che riflette in parte il diverso cammino personale presa dal personaggio centrale in ciascun libro.Il personaggio di Niccol\u00f2, o Claes, \u00e8 un apprendista di diciotto anni sempre allegro, nativo di Dyer, di sfortunata nascita, \u00e8 stato accolto da parenti di sua madre dopo la sua morte; ben presto diventa evidente che Claes, \u00e8 un eclettico e poliglotta, e si sta trasformando in un grande leader e giocatore di grandi giochi. Ama creare e risolvere i puzzle di ogni genere, \u00e8 bravissimo con la matematica, e si applica a imparare tutto il possibile (lingue, ingegneria, comabttimenti, costumi di corte, filosofia), sia per scopi pratici che per il bene di apprendimento. Da apprendista, salir\u00e0 la scala gerarchica a commerciante, poi banchiere, maestro di guerra, e infine consigliere di re. Nicholas ritiene di essere il figlio legittimo del bel Simon de St. Pol di Kilmirren, un signore scozzese, campione di giostre medievali e commerciante. Simon nega, sostenendo che Claes \u00e8 un bastardo nato dalla sua prima moglie. Il desiderio di Nicholas per l'accettazione del riconoscimento paterno guideranno gran parte della serie.La trama in sintesi (anche se \u00e8 molto complessa) di questo primo libro: il libro si svolge in gran parte nelle Fiandre, in Borgogna e in Italia nel 1460. Il lettore viene introdotto in un mondo molto diverso eppure sottilmente simile ai giorni nostri. Le ambizioni di classe, i giudizi realizzati sulla base delle linee di sangue, le barriere tra le famiglie nobili e quelle della borghesia nascente e quelle dei poveri considerati inferiori sono insuperabili. Ma sono tempi propizi per i giovani decisi a far fortuna e Claes - o Nicolas, o Niccol\u00f2: ogni nome segna una tappa del suo destino - , apprendista tintore di oscuri natali, \u00e8 uno di loro. Il giovane si mescola all'umanit\u00e0 sulla quale vuole emergere, gareggiando in astuzia con i mercanti e in spregiudicatezza con i mercenari e le spie. Dalla sua ha la bellezza, l'intelligenza, il potere di toccare il cuore delle donne e soprattutto, il fuoco inestinguibile dell'ambizione di primeggiare in un mondo che gli si offre come un frutto maturo.I libri della saga di Niccol\u00f2, uno pi\u00f9 bello dell'altro, per chi ama i libri storici questo ciclo dovrebbe essere un must da avere senza ma e senza se. L'autrice \u00e8 bravissima nel descrivere vita, luoghi, personaggi, trame complesse nel rinascimento dove colloca tutti i suoi personaggi. La scrittura \u00e8 opulenta di descrizioni, sembra quasi pennellare un affresco storico che pi\u00f9 lo osservi e impari a conoscerlo pi\u00f9 vieni trascinato dentro di esso. I personaggi sono complessi, ambigui e si muovono perfettamente nell'insieme del libro. Conoscerete anche voi Claes, umile apprendista, diventare mercante, mercenario, avventuriero... meraviglioso.Appassionante. La prima parola che mi viene in mente quando penso a questa serie di libri stupendi. Iniziata la lettura non riuscirete a staccarvi facilmente, consigliato a tutti ma specialmente a chi ama le ambientazioni storiche.Uno straordinario affresco storico."}, {"userName": "Lorie Ahlander Maenza", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3086263-lorie-ahlander-maenza", "userReview": "Niccolo RisingGoing on my second read of \"The House of Niccolo\". I am enjoying the story even more this time around. I read the Lymond Chronicals twice before I picked up this series. Thinking nothing could be better than the story of Lymond, I was amazed how the \"House of Niccolo\" series is just as surprising with characters that are insanely intelligent, funny and secretive.When we meet Niccolo his name is Claes (short for Nicholas), an apprentice dyer. From the very beginning like a chess game,he sets events and people into motion producing a calculated ripple effect that changes lives, countries and eventually himself. Nicholas, being only 19 years old, uses his intellectual abilities with an unassuming personality and embarks on influencing kings, bankers, nobels and merchants. Mainly, this is a journey of a young man grappling with his own brokeness from his past with an ability that has to be used or it consumes him. His friends try to lead him to be responsible and want to try and harness his genius for their own reasons. There are those who love him and want what they think is best,then those who want revenge. However, Niccolo has depths even he is discovering and growing into that others could now understand, but only a rare few.Dorothy Dunnett is a writer that challenges her characters as well as her readers. Her ability to paint landscape, describe cultures and bring history accurately alive has caused me to want to travel and see parts of the world I have never considered. I was able to experience a character that I will have to read about again to understand the depth of him."}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany", "userReview": "I read this for the first time in September of 2008. Then I liked it, though I knew I should like it more than I did. So I'm rereading it.

I'm going to enjoy the story for itself.You ought not be allowed to plow into these directly after reading the Lymond Chronicles.Apparently, I forgot quite a lot of this book. The first time I read it, I remember being disgruntled pretty much the whole time about the characters not being Lymond, Philippa, Kate, Sybilla, Archie and so forth. The dialog, and the narration, are not as quote-worthy. However the characters are (if not quite as dazzling) still excellently imagined. The plot, pacing, and writing are exquisite. It's a wonderful book, and it shouldn't be pilloried for not being Lymond.

Really? And... who?\" Which is not to say that Dunnett didn't lay out her plot well, but that she did so in a manner so labyrinthine and Byzantine that I think it surpassed the Lymond Chronicles at points. Though to be honest, with the exception of Dunnett's dense prose, and her love for angst and intricate plotting and detail, this didn't feel much like the Lymond Chronicles\u2014I suppose this is in part because Lymond's love of word play and literary allusions was entirely absent. A Dunnett novel entirely in English! Such a novelty. The main character is certainly a very different person to Lymond, too; less entrancing, perhaps, and a little bit more of a blank in some ways, though probably more... I won't say likeable, but perhaps more the kind of person whom you could tolerate spending time with. *g* A little bit more human, not quite so epic\u2014certainly, I can picture him being a child in a way I can never quite see Lymond being.

I'd say a good first half of it is a little chunky clunky with details that don't really start adding up until later on.While I don't really agree with him - I see in this book one of the things my dad didn't like about King Hereafter when I forced him to read it last year: that the audience, and most of the players, are never ever let in on the secrets. That the protagonist is somehow so omniscient and as the book goes on, it just reveals, one after another, the gajillion things he secretly knew that no one else figured out (if people figured bits of them out, no one else ever gets the full sweep). It IS unrealistic and it IS a little \"chatty\" (the narrator always letting you in on the game too late)... but I still find myself completely sucked in, completely rooting for the omniscient, oh-so-clever, oh-so-just-what-he-needs-to-be hero."}, {"userName": "Kerry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/382536-kerry", "userReview": "Niccolo Rising - Dorothy Dunnet (9/10)Historical fiction; book 1 of The House of Niccolo.I loved Dunnett's Lymond books and had tried to read this one in the past, but didn't get far.
