There's so much more to the history of witches in America than just the Salem trials - and so many obscure, bizarre, and almost unbelievable details that are absolutely true. The real-life stories of American Witches are sometimes poignant, sometimes humorous, (often both) and they're always thought-provoking. And American Witches has NEW revelations - including a new clue as to where Houdini got the idea to go undercover to expose fraudulent mediums, and a look at an original witch document written from Salem Prison that hadn't seen the light of day for many moons - until now!"}, {"userName": "Amanda NEVER MANDY", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36873041-amanda-never-mandy", "userReview": "**I received this book for free through Goodreads First Reads.**By nature, I am a brutally honest person that likes to get straight to the point. I suck at lying and I suck at sugarcoating things. I try to avoid situations like this when I really don\u2019t want to be me about something but know I am incapable of not being 100% me. See, I respect the hell out of authors and what they bring to the table. I do not have the courage to pour my heart and soul into something for the whole world to read and judge. I respect their courage but also respect that the reader has opinions and must not hold said opinions back to preserve the author\u2019s feelings.I will try to do this as kindly as possible.This is a book about the poor treatment throughout history of people who were labeled as witches or were witches. I was pretty excited to win this book because I expected a detailed history. I did not expect it to be written from a comical perspective. With that being said, there isn\u2019t anything wrong with adding a sarcastic tone to the story writing to emphasis how asinine the treatment of the accused was. BUT when it is not done well it comes across as inappropriate and poorly timed which is how this read to me.The research done in to the history felt very basic. A lot of it was common knowledge and I really didn\u2019t feel like I learned anything new. The final chapters regarding The Blair Witch Project did not seem to match the rest of what was presented. That wasn\u2019t the first time I noted a flow problem with the book. There were countless other times things felt off and I had to skim back through it to try to determine where I lost the thread.To put it simply, this book read like a high school research paper and I just can\u2019t like that."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11437111-richard", "userReview": "Very Fun read. More like journalism than academic but thought provoking nonetheless. The chapter on Christian Science was hilarious. This should be read along side Catherine Albanese's \"A Republic of the Mind and Spirit\" for a litter look and the dark side of America's religious history."}, {"userName": "Bambi Unbridled", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3234139-bambi-unbridled", "userReview": "American Witches is a light and engaging account of some of the darkest times in America's history. Susan Fair has a good voice and tells the multitude of witchy tales in a modern voice with laymen terms that will appeal to even the most casual reader and/or student. The history of witchcraft that ran rampant across America started even before people made it to the country. Bringing suspicions from England (and everywhere else), many would-be settlers never made it across the ocean due to bewitched voyages. Thus begins a journey through the history of America from the early settlers, through the Salem Witch Trials, American Indian witch hunts, and beyond. Accounts of bewitched children, livestock (especially pigs), unknown monsters, vessels and crops were not uncommon in the charges lodged against many society outcasts. Reading these fantastical tales that were all absolutely true really make you question human nature, and how neighbors could turn on one another with such viciousness. While most of the book is an entertaining history lesson, there are also a few modern tidbits, some pop culture type info, including an insightful look at the Blair Witch Project and an interview with the director. While I found this book interesting and entertaining, keep in mind that history accounts are slower reads. That being said, I recommend this book to just about anyone that finds America's witchy history intriguing. It would also be a good read for students who find it difficult to learn from dry and boring history books. I know I certainly would have remembered more of my history lessons if they were written in this manner.I received an advanced copy of this book from the publisher via Edelweiss in exchange for an honest review. Full review posted at Bambi Unbridled."}, {"userName": "Sosanna Olson", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5675484-sosanna-olson", "userReview": "This is a fun book to read. The majority of the books I read are either for work (computer in nature) or for research on Hecate. This book is neither. It was fun to sit down and just read a book for the value of the book. The author gives us a historic yet tongue in cheek look at American Witches from the journey to the new world to the Blair Witch. The information is clear and presented in a humorous manner. This book covers not only the historic Salem witchery but also some references to Native American tribes which I never really took into account when someone mentions American Witches. This book is a great one to have around to spend some quality time with a good book without the need to grab a note pad to jot notes. I certainly need to find more time for these type of books. The center of the book has some historic photographs related to the stories which I found to add a bit more \"realism\" to the book. This was a really great read and I highly recommend giving it a read."}, {"userName": "Pinar", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7721919-pinar", "userReview": "This was an extremely entertaining read. The topic of witches in America is grim at first, although the writer makes it bearable with her sense of humor. It does get lighter in tone once the hangings stop and it's just weird stuff people believe and the distance they go for it. Not an academic resource but I did learn a lot of details along the way. The epilogue is about the Blair Witch Project and as one of those people who had seen the website before the film (and was, like, WTF) it was really interesting to read how that whole thing played out."}, {"userName": "Marianne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13776724-marianne", "userReview": "Everyone should read this just to remind them of how quickly hysteria can spread throughout a society. I was a bit disappointed, however, in that there is no mention of real witches, witchcraft actual practices or modern day wicca practitioners. The chapter on Mary Baker Eddy is interesting but goes beyond the scope of the book. I wish she had written a little more balanced book with a little more serious treatment of a very serious subject."}, {"userName": "Mary Jones", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12672217-mary-jones", "userReview": "I loved this book so much! Enough humor to keep it from being dry history and really interesting stories that I hadn't heard before. Coincedentally, I started reading The Scarlett Letter and had just read the quoted passage about his family's history with the witch trials when I came to the part of the book where he is quoted. The Blair Witch chapter was a blast from the past. Looking forward to reading more from this author."}, {"userName": "Michael J.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23024615-michael-j", "userReview": "A nice overview of the history of witchcraft in America. Susan Fair provides a well-documented glimpse into the recorded instances of witches in America and the subsequent trials, imprisonments, and executions. She does so in a very entertaining and highly readable fashion. Fair has a nice flair for whimsy and gentle sarcasm, which runs throughout the book. I appreciate her perspective on a fascinating subject in American history."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8535655-teresa", "userReview": "* e-Arc provided by Edelweiss *"}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30677857-sara", "userReview": "I really enjoyed that this book included other stories outside of Salem. Some of the cases were started while at sea with accused being hung on ships. The Southern states, with their deer familiars, had a tendency to not punish, while the Northern states saw their witches put to death. A good portion of the 17th Century witch hunts were lead by the Mather family who saw witches everywhere, and anything could make a person a witch. The 18th century saw this cases decrease as people became more skeptical. Although the belief spread to Native American tribes. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the belief in witches disappeared. Witchcraft was seen in other ways though: murder cases and Christian Science. Fair also interjected a great amount of humor in her writing and one of my favorite parts was how she listed some statistics as awards. This is a great read for those interested in the subject."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33845674-steve", "userReview": "Susan Fair's fun and odd look at witches in America was an interesting read. This joyful read was far funnier than I imagined such a book would be, and also quite illuminating on the subject matter. Particularly engrossing is the content related to the Salem witches and all of those puritanical murderers and their religious-fueled paranoia. Particularly fascinating is how far into the future beyond the 1600s issues of witchcraft continued, even into the 20th century. What kept running through my mind as I read was how close we are to such witch hunts even today. Take some religious fervor, add a pinch of paranoia, some xenophobia or other prejudices, and a ton of irrational fear, stir with a populist leader who plays into these fears and, well, you can figure the rest. Cotton Mather walks among us. While we can't write the history books, we can at least marvel and be entertained by the history herein."}, {"userName": "John Krowka", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33966470-john-krowka", "userReview": "Witches Are People TooI admit that I enjoyed the many \u201cweird\u201d stories in this book. Who wouldn't want to know more about the murder of a supposed witch in Booger Hole, WV or bewitched pigs? Susan's Fair's ability to relate events from the past to our modern sensibilities is so uncanny that one might wonder if she had some help from down below! What I liked most about this book was how the witches and other characters were given names and made to come alive as real people. The only name I was familiar with before reading this book was Cotton Mather. Who knew that Ann Glover, a poor, eccentric Irishwoman who was the last witch hanged in Boston would be remembered by the City Council with the proclamation of November 16 as Goody Glover Day? The book is replete with many fascinating tales and makes for a very enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Silas", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5988834-silas", "userReview": "This was an interesting look at the history of witchcraft persecution cases in America. That designation is taken rather lightly, since it involves anyone regarded as a witch or involved in the occult or fortunetelling, up to and including Christian Scientists. It then shows its age by capping it off with a look at the Blair Witch movie and its effect on the area in Maryland where the film was set. There are some interesting new anecdotes here, and considering how much I have read about witchcraft and the occult, that's impressive. This was an interesting look at some usually ignored history."}, {"userName": "\u2740\u22b1Rory\u22b0\u2740", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25852225-rory", "userReview": "3.5 stars.This book has a fun, lighthearted tone that is often at odds with the horrific punishments and torture described. When you read what was done to these poor people, mostly older women, there's nothing amusing about it.There is plenty of careful research here and some interesting, less famous stories of witchcraft in America. So many of the books available focus on the notorious Salem witch trials; this one even has stories that took place on ships headed for the new world.All in all, a good starting place for people who want to know more about this dark time in our history but are looking for something lighter."}, {"userName": "Yola Hill", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55674674-yola-hill", "userReview": "Wow! A weird trip full of dark humor, surprising new stuff, a wry look at human nature - and lotsa witches! Really cool pop culture stop off with the story behind the Blair Witch Project & an interview with cool director Eduardo Sanchez, as well as a look at a really cool witch letter that apparently no one has seen in generations. The book helps to see how and why all these crazy incidents involving witchcraft occurred. And there's surprising new stuff about Howard Houdini and his spiritualist de-bunking!

Thankfully, it doesn't all focus on Salem - I was a little afraid this was going to be another rehash of the famous trials, and luckily, it wasn't!This book traveled through a history of accusations of witchcraft in Native American tribes, early accusations in colonial America, and other incidents since Salem.

I enjoyed that the book went beyond the Salem Witchcraft Trials of 1692 and that it also explored overseas voyages, Native American culture, Civil War, York Hex Trial, the Christian Science movement, and even the Blair Witch phenomenon. The \"Witch Awards\" was probably my favorite chapter."}, {"userName": "Lara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9998877-lara", "userReview": "This book was so much fun- entertaining as well as educational.

Although it was probably unintentional on the part of the author, Susan Fair, it was hard not to realize that the methods and hysteria surrounding witch hunts are still with us today. It's just that the modern version of \"she's a witch\" is \"he's a racist\" or \"he's a sexist.\" Some things never change."}, {"userName": "Marsha Rice", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59965312-marsha-rice", "userReview": "Fabulous read!I have read many written works on witchcraft history and, though informative, find them mostly dry and stilted.

From 19th-century murders to a bizarre monkey-faced creature straight from Hell to bewitched pigs hell-bent on revenge, American Witches: a Broomstick Tour through Four Centuries describes strange incidents that have long been banished to the margins of our history.On a tour through four centuries of American witchcraft that\u2019s both whimsical and startling, we\u2019ll encounter 17th-century children flying around inside their New England home \u201clike geese.\u201d We\u2019ll meet a father-son tag-team of pious Puritans who embarked on an anti-witch mission that involved undressing young ladies and overseeing hangings. And on the eve of the Civil War, we\u2019ll accompany a reporter as he dons a dress and goes searching for witches in New York City\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods.Entertainingly readable and rich in amazing details often left out of today\u2019s texts, American Witches casts a flickering torchlight into the dark corners of American history.
