The question posed: what if two opposed cities existed side by side (with more than an occasional overlap) but were separated, not by an actual wall like East and West Berlin, but by the deeply enculturated habit of deliberate ignorance, a studied denial of the other, a fierce determination not to see? The central dilemma: when a murder is committed in one city, and the body is dumped in the other, how do the detectives investigate the crime without violating the taboos of their society?The first third of the book (and a brief coda at the end) are filled with symbolic resonance. Unfortunately, however, the mystery itself is conventional, the action predictable, and the murderer easily guessed. The second third is less effective than the first, and the final section less effective still.If Mieville had embodied the symbolic essence of his original conceit in working out his plot, this might have been a work worthy of Kafka and Schulz--its major influences. As is, it is a so-so mystery with a hauntingly memorable setting.Then again . . . the setting continues to resonate long after the book is completed, for it has much to say to us about the uneasy compromises we make in a complex urban environment. Perhaps, after all, this resonance is enough."}, {"userName": "Nataliya", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3672777-nataliya", "userReview": "Wow. Okay, I'm definitely fangirling for China Mi\u00e9ville. I love his limitless imagination, the skill to effortlessly make an unbelievable premise feel real, and ability to turn any setting and place into a true protagonist.SOME SPOILERS MAY HAVE CREEPED IN SOMEHOW, SO BE WARNEDThis is my first non-Bas Lag novel, set in the (more or less) real world. But no reason to worry - this remains as much of \"weird fiction\" as anything else by His Chinaness. As Mi\u00e9ville tries to write a novel in every genre of fiction, this time he tackles a hardboiled noir crime mystery. A murder of a young woman, investigated by a slightly cynical but good and incorruptible detective Tyador Borl\u00fa of Beszel Extreme Crime Squad, quickly evolves into a much larger mystery plot. It is a detective story, a hard-boiled crime with all the specifics and peculiarities of this genre. We have a murder mystery, high reliance on dialogue, fast-paced plot, many logical leaps and jumps that may confuse the reader about certain plot points but that still shed light on the story as a whole. \"We are all philosophers here where I am, and we debate among many other things the question of where it is that we live.\"But the mystery plot, albeit engaging and interesting, feels just as an excuse to introduce the reader to the fascinating world of quasi-Eastern European twin cities of Besz\u00e9l and Ul Qoma. The cities are the true protagonists, not Detective Berl\u00fa whose character is little more than an outline, the window into this world. Once a single city, Besz\u00e9l and Ul Qoma were split apart by a mysterious Cleavage centuries ago. \"From that historically brief quite opaque moment, came the chaos of our material history, an anarchy of chronology, of mismatched remnants that delighted and horrified investigators.\"These are two separate nations with distinct languages, customs, clothes, economics. They do not like each other much. And yet they are not separated by any physical barrier - the division between them is done by their citizens who have been conditioned since the early age to 'unsee' and 'unhear' the citizens of the other country, even if they share the same streets and buildings in the 'crosshatched' areas belonging both to Besz\u00e9l and Ul Qoma. The cities share their past and present and their geography, but rigidly maintain the invisible lines of separation. Simply seeing and acknowledging someone from the other city - who can be within inches of you on the same street, on the same sidewalk, but yet in another country - is the ultimate crime, the breach.And it is this semi-willing separation between Besz\u00e9l and Ul Qoma that brings out the overarching themes of this book. The City & The City addresses the question of national identity and how it is determined. There is much more than simple geography that goes into creating a people, a nation. There are subtler things like bits and pieces of learned behaviors, strange and puzzling to the foreigners beliefs and habits, time-tested social conventions, seemingly ridiculous taboos based on strange old traditions. It's the amalgam of the little seemingly senseless and hard to understand things that defines a nation. As I'm visiting my Eastern European motherland right now, I'm struck by the realization of the same - how much the national identity is the direct result of little idiosyncrasies. And the question arises - what will become of the nation itself if its beliefs and peculiarities are questioned? Is there a comeback from that?\"It's not just us keeping them apart. It's everyone in Besz\u00e9l and everyone in Ul Qoma. Every minute, every day. We're only the last ditch: it's everyone in the cities who does most of the work. It works because you don't blink. That's why unseeing and unsensing are so vital. No one can admit it doesn't work. So if you don't admit it, it does. But if you breach, even if it's not your fault, for more than the shortest time ... you can't come back from that.\"As usual, Mi\u00e9ville presents us with superb and sophisticated world-building. The both cities are vivid and memorable, the atmosphere in both is depicted with skill and depth, and the nuances of this world are revealed subtly and unobtrusively without overt clunky exposition. As I came to expect from him, China Mi\u00e9ville takes a concept that is rather difficult to swallow - the duality of this world, relying on little else but the tradition to keep it going - and develops it so well that by the end of the book it felt real to me.The language of The City & The City, when compared to the Bas Lag books, is quite simple, even minimalistic. It is not luxurious or flowing; on the contrary, it is crisp, clear, and devoid of any extraneous words, any extraneous descriptions, any possible fluff. It was the first book by Mi\u00e9ville that I found a quick and easy read. And yet, despite the surface easiness, it is still incredibly sophisticated and very visual.This book fully deserves 4.5 stars. I highly recommend it both to Mi\u00e9ville fans and those who for whatever strange reason have not read his books yet."}, {"userName": "Stephan ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48197248-stephan", "userReview": "Full on \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605! This book is special. It's my first encounter with China Mieville and I'm very intrigued to read more. What a mind bending story. The 2 city concept is so challenging & fantastic, not just a great idea but something very hard to really grasp in detail.The language is brilliant and fits perfectly in creating this noir detective story feel, the way the story is told, unfolding it layer by layer without ever being presented with a final truth and creating an atmosphere of strangeness and fascination!In other books I would have taken issue with the lack of explanations starting very soon in the book. But the way Mieville presents the mysteries and the what-the-hell-is-happening-here is so authentic. It's written from the perspective of the main character - and he is not explaining himself to the reader.It didn't take long for me to get hooked on the story and there wasn't a moment of slowness in it for me. In my edition there was an interview with the author at the end, which I found deepend my understanding of the author without revealing more about the mystery. I'm looking forward to read more of his books. Thanks for the wonderful ride!I just learned this book is being adapted to film. I really would like to see how that turns out!

We all know that relationships have there ups and downs and that spats are going to happen even to the strongest of them. Well a few months ago, after having a couple of incredible years with China Mieville\u2019s books, (i.e., Perdido Street Station and The Scar and ), both of which are among my ALL TIME FAVORITES...suddenly turmoil. The cause of the turmoil was Un Lun Dun, which I just did not like and thought was UGH-LAME-DUMB. All of sudden, what I thought was going to be a story-book, literary bromance was rife with doubts, questions and a whole lot of uncertainty. Well all that is past like gas my friends. I am here to tell you that The City & The City is the best apology/make-up reading experience I have ever had and has recharged my bookish man-crush on CM until it is once again at full throb. I mean WOW! WOW! WUBBZY! everyone, this story is pure liquid gold, highly literate and puts the PRO back in prose in mind-bombing fashion. \nWhat I once might have said with irony, I now say with conviction...CHINA...MIEVILLE...IS...THE MAN!! Okay, as I imagine my gush will continue throughout this written version of a standing ovation, let me at least thumbnail the plot for you as it is a corker. The book is framed as a crime/mystery/detective thriller. The main character is Tyador Borlu, a detective in the Extreme Crime Squad (ECS) for the City of Beszel, who is investigating the brutal murder of a young female student. While never geographically placed, Beszel is a fictional Eastern European city that I was thinking was somewhere in the vicinity of Bulgaria/Romania/Hungary. With me so far...okay... ...Now enter the completely original, BRAIN-CRAMP-INDUCING, OMGnormously brilliant central Mievillian concept...(NOTE: If you have mushrooms, peyote or some other mind-expanding substance, you might want to take some now before continuing....AHHHHHH that\u2019s better...but now...WOAH...everything is so GREEEEEN....sorry about that...where was I...oh yeah the awesomeness.Major parts of Beszel are geographically located and exist in the same physical space as major parts of another city known as Ul Qoma. The history of how this happened is only hinted at and mostly shrouded in mystery but the result is that these two cities each have 3 distinct areas. Areas 1 and 2 are those parts of the cities that are 100% in one city or another (basically, what we would call normal). These are referred to by residents of the cities as either Total (what a citizen calls the parts that are 100% in their own city) or Alter (what a citizen calls the parts that are 100% in the \u201cother\u201d city). Still with me...good because here is where it gets real tricky dicky. The third \u201carea\u201d type is referred to as \u201ccross-hatched.\u201d As the name implies, these are areas where the cities overlap and places appear in both cities. As Wackyspeedia puts it, \u201cThese might be streets, parks or squares where denizens of both cities walk alongside one another, \nalbeit unseen\n.\u201d Now let\u2019s talk about the \u201calbeit unseen\u201d because that is the crux of the fantastical element of the story. People from both cities are indoctrinated from birth to \u201cunsee\u201d people from the other city in those areas that are cross-hatched. To acknowledge or \u201csee\u201d someone from another city is the single worst taboo in both cities (more so even than murder) and is referred to as \u201cbreach.\u201d I know, kinda hurts the head, but believe me when I say that CM does such an amazing job with the story that after the first 75 to 100 pages you are completely immersed in the world and it actually makes sense. That\u2019s enough plot background. From there you are on your own but CM has your back and you are in the most capable of hands. MOST IMPRESSIVE ASPECTS OF THE NOVELFirst: The ability for Mieville to make this complex, cerebrally challenging world come to life and resonate with the reader. Basically everything I said above. Second: As good as the concept was, the execution of this tremendously difficult idea is the single greatest accomplishment of this story and something that is almost never done successfully with this kind of difficult, central concept. The book stays in character THE ENTIRE TIME. There is never a moment when Mieville writes himself into a \u201ccross hatched\u201d corner or loses control of his grand idea. How many times have you been intrigued by a novel because of a cool idea only to have it be \u201ctoo big\u201d for the author to handle. Well CM is up to the task. Once you accept the two cities occupying the same space, he never makes you regret it. There are no \u201cgotcha\u201d moments where the world-building fails or where the reader is left saying \u201cthat doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Another author I like and respect, Michael Moorcock, put it this way: \n On many levels this novel is a testament to [CM\u2019s] admirable integrity. Keeping his grip firmly on an idea which would quickly slip from the hands of a less skilled writer, Mi\u00e9ville again proves himself as intelligent as he is original.\n EXACTLY.Third: The rest of my list are all things we have heard many times before applied to China Mieville, but they are worth repeating. Number three is his prose. Lush, poetic, beautiful and as addicting as a caramel sundae with \u201ccrack\u201d sprinkles and a large order of duck fat french fries with liquid meth/heroin dipping sauce. Fourth: Dialogue, dialogue, dialogue...CM is the deity of dialogue, the god of gab, and the kCing of conversation. His character interactions always feel authentic and believable and yet are so slick and breezy that the words slide right off the page. Five: Plot/Pacing has been the one area where even my favorite CM stories sometimes fall a little short. NOT this time. The plot and pacing are just about perfect. The plot is complex, intricate and oh so engrossing and yet the pacing skates along at very good clip. I think a big reason for this stems from the story being only 300 pages long (whereas PSS and The Scar were both in the 700 page realm). 300 pages is the perfect length for a mystery story and China hits the bull right in eye on this one. Well that\u2019s about it, but I feel like I have to say at least something negative about the book so that it feels like an even-handed review. Okay, here are two \u201cnegatives\u201d: (1) the cover art was pretty mediocre and (2) the book is still not as good as Perdido Street Station. There, satisfied. Apart from that, I loved this book. I give it 6.0 Stars, have added it to my list of All Time Favorite novels and am very pleased that CM and I were able to get over our recent troubles.

The unseen and the uncity occur throughout his work in varying forms, but they come together in The City and The City with an intensity and concreteness that he has only flirted with before.Saul Garamond (King Rat), Silas Fennec (The Scar), Toro & Spiral Jacobs (Iron Council), The Weaver (Perdido Street Station), are all characters that move unseen. Each have their own reasons for moving unseen and their own methods for achieving it, but all of them move in and through the spaces that others cannot see or fail to see or choose not to see. And all of the motives and reasons for unseeing these characters culminate in the Beszel/Ul Qoma /Breach unseeing that Inspector Tyador Borlu of the Besz Extreme Crime Squad moves through in his search for the killer of a young American archaeologist.But the murder mystery, and even the potential conspiracies that swirl around the murder, are nowhere near as important as the way these two cities crosshatch and overlay and grosstopic, and the way people from the mundane to the Breach move through and around and in and outside all the permutations of these places in one place.And that concept of cities being more than what we are willing to see is the other piece of Mi\u00e9ville's narcissitically intertextual puzzle. In The City & The City it is two cities in the same space with a possible third city in the cracks. In Un-Lun-Dun it is an ab-city for every city. And in Reports Of Certain Events In London, Varmin Way is a rogue street that hides and moves and won't let itself be found, and Mi\u00e9ville himself is the care taker of the files that speak of the streets existence.And even when Mi\u00e9ville's cities are behaving like cities should, their presence is so powerful, like Armada and New Crobuzon, that they are almost entities in their own right.The City and The City is the culmination of just over ten years of China Mi\u00e9ville's already impressive career, but it won't receive the love it deserves, at least not for now. Once David Fincher or some other visionary director decides to put it on film, however, it may well become Mi\u00e9ville's most respected work. Too bad Orson Welles wasn't still alive.

Certainly the feel of Los Angeles is entirely different from NYC, and different again from Chicago, right? But what are the components to a city's character? Despite being the centerpiece of the novel, The City and the City never came alive for me. Half the time I felt as if I was reading a dusty encyclopedia description of a city and half the time an oddly paced but elaborate mystery.The story begins typical for the detective-mystery genre: we follow Inspector Tyador Borlu of the Extreme Crime Squad to the scene of a murdered and nude woman. It is a seedy, run-down area full of addicts, and at first it appears as if she's another lost soul from the streets. Tyador commanders an eager young subordinate, Corwi, for her street contacts and legwork. Before long, an anonymous tip points them in the direction of Il Qoma, the city that lives within/alongside/interstices with their own city of Beszel. The citizens of both places are monitored by Breach, a mysterious authority who will spirit away those who mistakenly acknowledge the partner city without following proper channels.\"'Why were you there?''... It was a conference. 'Policing Split Cities.' They had sessions on Budapest and Jerusalem and Berline, and Beszel and Ul Quoma.''Fuck!''I know, I know. That's what we said at the time. Totally missing the point.''Split cities? I'm surprised the acad let you go.'\"The idea of two cities, co-existing in shared spaces but actually separate nations, is a brilliant idea. Unfortunately, Big Idea is all that holds this story together, which has little to humanize it amidst a slow and painful investigation. It occurred to me that this is the premise of so many other books, the unseen co-existing with the seen, but I felt it was hard to get a grip on the intricacies of the schism.Bezel and Il Quoma never truly differentiated for me. I think part of the reason is that Mieille relies on two main modes of describing his cities: the architecture and the political history. I felt very much like I was being given a lesson on Yugoslavia, or walled-Berlin, or one of the split cities so overtly mentioned. An example from page 43:\"In typical political cliche, unificationists were split on many axes. Some groups were illegal, sister-organisations in both Beszel and Ul Qoma. The banned had at varioius points in their history advocated the use of violence to bring the cities to their God-, destiny-, history-, or people-intended unity. Some had, mostly cack-handedly, targeted nationalist intellectuals--bricks through windows and shit through doors. They had been accused of furtively propagandising among refugees and new immigrants with limited expertise at seeing and unseeing, at being in one particular city. The activists wanted to weaponise such urban uncertainty.\"I can appreciate such description, but does it resonate? Evoke emotion? I think of Kate Griffin's Matthew Swift series, how London comes alive with the lyrical descriptions, and wonder at the difference. Perhaps people would have helped, or further character-building of the ones we had. Histories of the characters could have been used to gain more insight into the schism between the two, but only Tyador's youth is shared in any detail. About the only person that stood out for me was the detective's superior, who humorously managed to undercut Borlu's complaints with every line of dialogue.\"'This is bullshit. We've been screwed.''It is bullshit, he tells me,' Gadlem said to the world. 'He tells me we've been screwed.''We've been screwed, sir. We need Breach. How the hell are we supposed to do this? Someone somewhere is trying to freeze this where it stands.''We've been screwed, he tells me, and I note he tells me so as if I am disagreeing with him. Which when last I looked I was not doing.'\"I enjoyed China's word-play, particularly 'grosstopically,' reference to things that are near in physical space but from different nations But the word-smithing didn't feel as sophisticated as Embassytown or as fun as Kraken, which is interesting, as they were published in a three-year span. Most of the vocabulary was created around the idea of 'unseeing' the neighbor city and it's occupants. Overall, the language felt stilted and excessively formal for genre fiction, further distancing me from the story.It's not that I don't understand the exploration of the dissonant, conjoined cities. We take the noir detective format, incorporate a nice play on the idea of two cities, merged but unseen, occupying almost the same space with each other. It's actually a relatively common exercise in the spec-fic/sci-fi world, giving an author (and reader) familiar concepts to latch onto while the author forays into stranger places. There are times the Big Idea works well and can carry a novel on its own, but for me, this wasn't it. I'd suggest Only Forward if you want to play with the idea of city and identity."}, {"userName": "BlackOxford", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17744555-blackoxford", "userReview": "O Happy FaultI have never underestimated China Mieville\u2019s writing talent. But until recently I also hadn\u2019t realized the depths of his thought. The City & the City is not merely a cleverly structured detective novel, it is also a rather profound anthropological analysis.The premise of the book is that the City in question is divided in two by a sort of psychological Iron Curtain, sometimes at the level of individual dwellings. The two parts of the City intertwine physically, but the residents of each half are not permitted to see, hear, smell, touch, or otherwise interact with the residents of the other half. Each population is restricted to its designated spaces in which everyone lives apparently normal lives but with no awareness of the others who live among them.Residents from each half may visit the other half by transferring through a sort of border tunnel in the middle of the City. Having crossed from one half to the other, the visitor is required to participate fully in its life. He or she must \u2018unsee\u2019 everything with which he is intimately familiar from his half. Any lapse in this protocol is considered a Breach and is dealt with harshly as a matter of law.There are certainly a variety of ways in which Mieville\u2019s imagination can be interpreted: for example, as a representation of the human psychological ability to simply ignore what it does not wish to see; or as the regrettable compartmentalization of modern life in which certain moral behaviors are permissible in one \u2018box\u2019 but anathema in another; or as a critique of the economic, social, and racial ghettoization of not just cities but also of whole societies.My first reading resulted in an interpretation of the City as wallowing in an unfortunate fate, implicitly waiting and hoping for some sort of redemptive unification of the City. The separation of the two parts of the City was the result of an obscure historical act equivalent to Original Sin. No one remembers what the act was or when it was committed but its effects persist in the rigid and unnecessary conventions that dominate the City\u2019s life.Upon reflection, I have come to a very different interpretation of the book thanks to the influence of an unexpected source, a discussion of so-called \u2018religious aesthetics\u2019 by a theologian named Frank Burch Brown [see: https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...]. Brown\u2019s analysis opens up a very different possibility for understanding Mieville\u2019s idea of parallel worlds occupying the same geographical space but alien to one another. This alternative explanation is based on some rather interesting observations on aesthetics, the study of choosing the filters by which we allow ourselves to perceive the world. Generalizing his conception a bit, what Brown suggests is that Mieville\u2019s type of split world is not a flaw or distortion but a necessary condition for human beings to avoid falling into the trap of their own hubris. Each world in fact helps to make the other visible. The unique social conventions, mores, architecture, literature, cuisine, and routines of one can never be taken entirely for granted because there is another set of these cultural conditions, literally just around the corner. This fact ensures that neither half of the City can ever turn itself, its particular concerns, aims, and prejudices into idols because \u2018This is the way the world really is.\u2019 They are forced in daily life to recognize the existence of the \u2018other\u2019 precisely through the persistent demand to not notice it. Brilliant.So the \u2018split personality\u2019 of The City & the City is not a flaw resulting from some horrible primordial mistake, but a well-conceived design executed by some wise folk to to keep the residents from that most dreadful mortal sin of believing one\u2019s own press."}, {"userName": "J.L.

As Extreme Crime Squad Inspector Borlu investigates the death of archaeology student, Mahalia Geary, it quickly becomes clear that so much more is going on than just a murder. Mieville's novel combines 'weird fiction' (the genre with which Mieville is associated) with the police procedural (in the tone of noir detective fiction). It took me a bit of time to fully immerse myself in this world, but once I did I really enjoyed it! The way Mieville delineates the shared geographical spaces of the two cities and the rules surrounding what constitutes Beszel and what Ul Qoma is really incredible. How the residents of the two cities must (upon penalty of Breach) treat the cities becomes inseparable from the plot (solving the murder). Admittedly, solving the case takes a backseat to the novel's other concerns. Still, it's interesting to see how residents of Beszel and Ul Qoma learn how to 'unsee' what isn't really part of their world. This is something I think happens in lots of places we live. What, for instance, constitutes the city we live in and that which we refuse to see or acknowledge in the same city? If residents of either Beszel or Ul Qoma want to visit the other city, they must cross over at a designated point (with proper paperwork). When Inspector Borlu tells a joke about the weather in the other city being worse, everyone knows it's a joke, but they can't treat it that way. I thought the moment was funny, but it was also revealing of the way the world is constructed. This world becomes more complicated when it's suggested that Orsini (a third city) might also share the same space as Beszel and Ul Qoma.

To find her killer, Borlu must go to the neighboring city of Ul Qoma and team with Qussim Dhatt of the Murder Squad. Can the two detectives from different cultures figure out who the victim is and why she was killed?Wow. The core premise of The City & The City requires some explaining but I think I'm up to the task. Remember those perceptual illusions you were so enamored with when you were a kid? Like the old woman/young girl:Okay. Instead of images of an old woman and a young girl, picture instead two cities that overlap. People from one city are trained from birth to unsee/unsense people and buildings in the other city. Still with me? Now picture a murder mystery set in one of the intersections between the two cities. Yeah, it was one mindbender of a read.While The City & The City is firmly in the new weird genre, it's also a gritty crime story, which makes it substantially more accessible than many of Mieville's works. Tyador Borlu and Qussim Dhatt are the bickering cops that secretly grow to respect one another as they unravel a mystery than snakes back and forth between the two neighboring cities. Kind of like Jim Belushi and Arnold in Red Heat, except good.The thing that makes The City & The City work is that the cities are quite different from one another. While Ul Qoma and Beszel aren't as detailed as New Crobuzon, they are both distinct entities. While the idea of being in one city or the other is really odd, Mieville does a good job of explaining it and making it seem plausible. How often do you actually remember what homeless people look like, for example.The concept of the Breach is also part of the glue that holds the story together. Part police force, part bogey man, the Breach enforce the unseeing/unsensing of the other city, keeping people from going back and forth between cities with impunity.There's not a lot else I can say without ruining key plot points. If they were to make a movie of one of China Mieville's books, this would be the one. I kept seeing Ewan MacGregor and Jason Statham as the cops. It reminds me of Grant Morrison's The Invisibles at times, Neverwhere at others, and Jeff Vandermeer's Finch at still other times. I didn't like it quite as much as Finch but it was still spectacular. For fans of both detective fiction and the new weird, it's definitely a must-read. 4.5 out of 5."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "Urban RecallI read this almost 12 months ago, which makes it difficult to recall and recount the tone of the writing. However, I would like to make some general comments about the novel.An Abstract High Concept Novel In one sense, it is an abstract high concept novel. What does this mean? It's high concept in the sense that it takes a basic concept and explores it in detail. And it doesn't stray very far away from that concept. It's not \"Snakes on a Plane\". It's far more abstract than that.The Concept The concept is basically: what if two cities and cultures or civilisations co-existed in the one physical city? I don't mean two distinct areas with a wall separating them like Berlin or Jerusalem. I don't mean two sides of the same street being administered by different councils or governments. One analogy for the City in the novel would be one city populated by some people and administered by one council during the day, then everybody moves out and it's a different people and council at night. If that makes sense so far, then this City has one difference. It isn't separated by day and night. The two Cities within the City co-exist in time, but in the same geographical space (hence, the City and the City). Everybody is everywhere at the same time, but they are separate. They walk down the same streets, they drive on the same roads, but they are legally separate. They aren't allowed to look at each other or acknowledge each other's existence. Each City must act and behave as if the other City isn't there. So this is the abstract high concept.Mixing Genres Mieville explores this fantasy concept within the crime thriller genre. Some readers question whether this is the right vehicle for the concept. They feel it makes the cardinal error of mixing genres. But I think it makes sense.The Law The two different Cities are basically legal constructs. They need the law to make the separation concrete. The law sits at the interface between the two Cities and enforces their separation. Any breach has to be detected and punished by the law. Therefore, when a breach occurs in the novel, we find out the true nature of the Cities, the law and the justice system.The Corruption As usual, there is too much law and not enough justice. As you would expect, these institutions end up being corrupt, not because they are institutions, but because they are institutions established and maintained by humans for human reasons. The novel is really the story of these institutions and their corruption.The Detective and the Crime Like crime fiction, it is told through the eyes of a detective investigating a small crime, which ultimately leads to the detection of a big crime. You could almost say it is the story of the Crime and the Crime (so I will). The ToneWhether Mieville gets the tone right is a subjective issue. We don't know a lot about the back story of the characters, we don't get a lot of physical descriptions. We do get a well-constructed feel for the Kafkaesque atmosphere that defines this city. People walk its streets like automatons or ghosts, unwilling to look left or right, for fear that they will breach the separation of the two Cities. So if characters don't seem like they're human, if a reader feels that they are just cyphers, it's because the City has stripped their humanity away, it's the result of a stylistic choice (not the result of poor writing).Abstract but Powerful I admired Mieville's ability to construct these worlds and explore them credibly, while making the novel work at a metaphorical and political level. The novel could describe life in a totalitarian state, it could describe life in a separated city or nation, but it might also symbolise cultures where people co-exist, but don't acknowledge each other's existence or right to participate in institutions as equals. This could describe Christians and Jews, Christians and Muslims, whites and blacks, men and women, the rich and the poor. This differentiation exists everywhere, Mieville's genius is to explore it through a highly abstract, but powerful, metaphor. So comparisons with both Kafka and Chandler are apt.Collins St, 5pmCOLOUR SPOILER ALERTI don't want to spoil the visuals of the book for you, but below is a link to a wiki article about a 1955 painting that the book evokes for me.The painting explores a similar concept as a metaphor for alienation.One warning before you view it though: Partly because of the cover, I imagined The City as a blue/grey world, the world of this painting is brown.So if you want to leave scope to choose your own colours, you might not want to visit the link until you've read the book.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collins_..."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "China Mieville is to modern fiction as The Clash was to popular music of their day: fresh, alive, vibrant, powerful, edgy, dangerous, misunderstood and by all accounts \u2013 original. The City and The City is about as original an idea, concept, theme as I can imagine\u2013 and all put together nicely into an ostensible murder mystery. While that is the tone and structure, to me the real story was the absurdist city on top of or within, or beside or related to the other city. Or whatever. Don\u2019t want to add any spoilers but a reader will be well into the book on their own before they figure it out, if they do. Working well within its own parameters, I also saw the value of the concept in terms of allegory, perhaps a message about how boundaries, affected and arbitrary, are absurd and our beliefs and reliance in them equally as outlandish. After reading Kraken, I placed the absurdist label on that writing, but not the Kafkaesque absurdity but rather the Monty Python kind. This one has the unmistakable influence of Kafka, but still with the charm and humor of Cleese, Palin and the rest of the troupe. A very good read."}, {"userName": "James Thane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3483907-james-thane", "userReview": "In The City & the City, China Mieville blends fantasy, sci-fi and crime fiction into one of the most interesting books I've read in a while. It's a tale of two cities set in eastern Europe. One, Beszel, is in decay; the other, Ul Qoman, is much more prosperous. The kicker is that the two cities share the same physical space and the citizens of one city are strictly forbidden from interacting with citizens of the other. Citizens of one city are prohibited from even looking at each other or into each others' cities. Should they do so accidentally, they are required to immediately look away and \"unsee\" what they have just seen. There is one legal border crossing where, with a good enough reason, a citizen of one city may legally cross into the other. To do so otherwise, or to notice something or someone in the other city without looking away, is to be in Breach, and the punishments for being in Breach are beyond severe.As the story opens, a woman is found murdered in Beszel, and Inspector Tyador Borlu of the Extreme Crime Squad is assigned to investigate. Borlu quickly discovers that the woman was actually killed in Ul Quoma and dumped in Beszel, which would be a clear case of Breach. Borlu assumes that the case will be taken away from him and that the killer or killers will be found and punished by the Breach authorities who deal with such matters.Because of a technicality, though, it turns out that the murder was not in Breach and so the case still belongs to Borlu. To investigate, he must cross over into Ul Quoma, where he is teamed with a detective named Qussim Dhatt who leads the investigation there. The two quickly discover that something much more sinister than a run-of-the-mill murder may be going on here.Tyador Borlu is, at heart, the archetypal detective with roots all the way back at least as far as Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe. He's determined to solve this case and find justice for the victim, no matter the odds and personal danger that might be involved. But he must do so in a world that neither Sam Spade, Philip Marlowe, Harry Bosch, nor any other such detective could ever have imagined.It took me a while to get into this book and to buy into the principle of the two cities, but once I did, I was completely hooked and couldn't wait for the climax. There's an awful lot going on in this story and I'm probably not smart enough to appreciate half of what Mieville is attempting to accomplish here. At one level, the book may be seen an allegory about the worlds that each of us live in and the worlds that occupy the same space but that we might prefer not to see. Think, for example, of the reaction that many people have when seeing a homeless person shuffling down the street, pushing his or her liberated grocery cart full of possessions along the sidewalk. The tendency we often have is to look away, or to \"unsee\" the person, and to proceed about our business as if problems like homelessness didn't exist in our world. This is a very interesting and stimulating book, one that the reader will be left thinking about for a long time."}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon", "userReview": "Ugh, I feel like such a jerk.

The basic idea of this book is not hard to understand, but it is a springboard to an extraordinary level of weirdness. The book is set in two cities that occupy the same geographical space. Imagine two cities existing side by side and then whisk them so that they are all jumbled up. That is one way of looking at the setting. The citizens of Besel* and Ul Qoma are not permitted to interact with the citizens, objects, or ground space of the other city. They are not even allowed to sense them except to avoid a collision. Of course actual seeing and hearing cannot be helped but they have to \u201cunsee\u201d, \u201cunhear\u201d, \u201cunsmell\u201d etc., a kind of mandatory constant denial.The main story is basically a murder mystery where a body of a \u201cJane Doe\u201d is found and it is the job of a police detective to find her killer. It turns out that both cities are involved and maybe even a third secret city also occupying the same location. The world of The City & The City is actually Earth apparently in the present day with references to the internet, MS Windows and Tom Hanks movies to vaguely indicate the time period. The two city-states are located in what appears to be Eastern Europe.Usually, I try to avoid reading a book\u2019s synopsis before I start reading it. I enjoy discovering the plot, the setting and characters as I read, but as far as The City & The City is concerned this may not be such a good idea, Mi\u00e9ville does not start the narrative with any kind of exposition to set the scene. The readers are pretty much left to immediately fend for themselves from the first page. This is not really a problem if you already have a little prior knowledge of the very odd setting from a summary.Reading this book is not a walk in the park, China Mi\u00e9ville made an effort to create such a bizarre world and culture for you to explore and some exertion is expected from the reader. As can be expected of any China Mi\u00e9ville book the writing is excellent, the characters are interesting (though take a little getting used to) and a little dry humour is scattered in several places. The climax is mind bendingly imaginative and the ending is rather poignant.The City & The City defies simple categorization though \u201cspeculative fiction\u201d is the most suitable as it is a very broad term that encompasses both science fiction and fantasy, and anything else that falls in between (maybe the fiction & the fiction?). This review is of a reread and it made me realize that the major disadvantage of rereading a whodunit is that I already know who did it as soon as the character\u2019s name is mentioned in the book, fortunately, the why of it, in this case, is fairly complicated and has to be rediscovered. More importantly The City & The City has much more to offer than a conventional crime fiction novel. This is not a breezy read, but it is a book that I would like to recommend to everybody; give the ol\u2019 little grey cells a nice workout, and while it is challenging it is not overly formidable and certainly an enriching experience for the mind.*The name of the Besel city seems to be spelled differently in some editions.________________________________Note:I just realised that I have to do some \"unseeing\" all the time when I am typing on my English/Thai keyboard:When I am typing in one language I have to \"unsee\" the alphabets of the other language. It is very disorienting when I switch from typing in one language to another. Living in either Besel or Ul Qoma would quickly drive me insane."}, {"userName": "Megan Baxter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5742086-megan-baxter", "userReview": "This book has been causing thoughts since I finished it a couple of days ago.

I listened to the audiobook which was at that 10-hour sweet spot I love. And overall the story was incredibly well-crafted and engaging. The way that Mieville blends the detective/crime fiction genre with pseudo-sci-fi elements was really ingenious. It was complex and imaginative but never too hard to follow. I would highly recommend this one to people who enjoy either crime novels or sci-fi, but with a twist. He goes beyond the expectations of both genres and delivers something with more depth, especially the sociopolitical commentary on refugees. 4/5 stars."}, {"userName": "Eliasdgian", "userReviewDate":

A chapter read, four chapters listened to; three chapters read, two chapters listened to; and on. Teaching this book in a town in a different province than the town I live in, across a straight, over a bridge (my adopted country's longest, the adopted country that plays such an important role in the piece, which is itself a nation sandwiched between nations in our always); a soccer game was played with four teams and two balls, simultaneously filling the same grosstopography, unseeing each other, unseeing the other game, but there was I in net, in perpetual Breach, defending one goal from two teams, and my fellows from Breach were busy removing those who Breached during play. And I found myself loving the mystery of the book then thinking it was too weak then loving it all over again when the twist I'd forgotten reminded me of Mi\u00e9ville's genius and why the mystery really does work. And I found myself loving and loving and loving the alterity of the spaces that Tyador and Corwi and Dhatt navigated with their unseeing, unhearing, unknowing senses as they were forced to see and hear and know. The City and the City is a masterpiece. One hundred years from now this book, and others of Mi\u00e9ville's ouevre will be canon. He's the first writer I've discovered, and long before others had, that I can say that about. And one of the few of the future canon with whom I am contemporary. I am lucky to be reading him now, in his pomp, the way little boys were lucky to see Wayne Gretzky play hockey live. I will never see Mi\u00e9ville's like again."}, {"userName": "Camille Stein", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19308897-camille-stein", "userReview": "City & City | Panfilocastaldi - http://ow.ly/4n4gfS Era all\u00ed, en el sombreado de intersecci\u00f3n de l\u00edneas, donde los estudiantes pod\u00edan quedarse, escandalosamente, a un palmo de distancia de una autoridad extranjera, una pornograf\u00eda de separaci\u00f3n....No debe ser tarea f\u00e1cil construir una arqueolog\u00eda tan compleja como la urdida por China Mi\u00e9ville.

I love novels that are totally unpredictable. It seems like I enjoy half of the novels I've read by China Mi\u00e9ville, and the other half I dislike. This is one of those that I like. And each of Mi\u00e9ville's novels is totally different. You cannot judge his writing from just a single book.This novel is NOT science fiction--it seemingly takes place in the present day, and the available technology is no different than that available to us, today. Most of the world, too, is just as it is today, except for a few dual cities. This is a detective story, much in the same vein as many others, where the story begins with a murder, and a detective is singled out to take the case.And, this is where the fantasy comes in. Detective Borlu lives in an old, decaying city named Breszel. This city has a neighboring city, named Ul Quoram. But neighboring is not quite the right word; they are two cities with streets, parks, sidewalks literally shared between the two. And citizens of each are never to look at any buildings, cars, or people belonging to the other city. It is illegal to cross over or even look at any portion of the other city, and the punishment is \"breach\". This weird arrangement has developed for some unknown reason, and it is the cause of many strange dilemmas. Just as an example, how can you drive avoiding pedestrians and other vehicles that you are not legally able to see?In the beginning of the novel, it is very difficult to figure out what in the world is going on. The author does not explain. But, it gradually gets explained indirectly, and it becomes a fascinating, schizophrenic world.

Like me. All I have to say is: it\u2019s a good thing that I have an endless store of patience and I like being confused. In audiobook terms, it took eight miles, three loads of laundry, four bathrooms, and a huge batch of vegetable korma for me to start liking this book. My interest was sparked by his creative, highly detailed world building, and my brain was completely engaged by the dozens of philosophical tangents that this world initiated in me. Oh, and there\u2019s also a murder mystery, but that feels more like window dressing for some Very Big Ideas.This book begins like so many other murder mysteries \u2013 with a young, beautiful, dead girl in an alley. Of course everyone assumes that she\u2019s a prostitute, and of course, she ends up having a much larger story to tell. Inspector Tyador Borlu of the Beszel Extreme Crime Squad is one of the first to arrive at the scene. He soon begins to suspect that the murder is a precursor to a much more significant crime: breach. In Beszel, the people are conditioned from childhood to \u201cunsee\u201d and not perceive in any way the people of Ul Qoma, a city which occupies some of the same geographic space as Beszel and is distinguished only by the learned habits of the citizens and the architecture and language endemic to each area. To see, acknowledge, or cross over into Ul Qoma from Beszel is a taboo \u2013 the severest of crimes, policed by a shadowy and seemingly all powerful force named for the crime itself. But when it is revealed that breach has in fact not taken place, Inspector Borlu must investigate the murder, which necessitates a journey through Beszel, Ul Qoma, and all the places in between.Somewhere around halfway through this book, the foreground of the murder mystery faded for me and the backdrop of the cities took center stage. This book made me think about the ways that we all define ourselves and our homes, and how they have very little to do with geographic location. It made me think about all of the social constructs and taboos that aren\u2019t in place because of logic or natural inclination, but because of generations of training and conditioning. It made me think about how easy it is to see the absurdity of these behaviors as an outsider, but how impossible it is to see them from the inside. It made me think about revolution: how complicity and pack mentality can keep a belief in place, but how minds are inevitably opened and changed one at a time. It made me think about how some people go out looking to have their beliefs undermined and others hold violently to what they have, but most of us fall into neither category. And this book made me think about how lonely and debilitating it can be to have even the most illogical of beliefs dissolved away. Once your eyes are opened, you can never go back to the way you were.So yeah, with all of these thoughts swimming around in my head (and really, I\u2019m pretty sure that I didn\u2019t even scratch the surface of this thing), it\u2019s easy to understand why I found the murder plot and even the main character to be a bit flat. So, if you are new to China Mieville, I would suggest starting somewhere else (I\u2019ve already checked out Perdido Street Station and Un Lun Dun to attempt a catch-up) and if you already love China Mieville, then you will probably get way more out of this book than I did! I highly recommend it for current fans, or people who like to be thrown in the deep end.Perfect Musical PairingRadiohead \u2013 Little by LittleIf a hypothetical cave-dwelling friend of mind had never heard anything from Radiohead, and wanted an introduction, I would never give her the latest album. For Radiohead fans, The King of Limbs is another complex, haunting work of genius. But I can see how the uninitiated might find it dense and strange. This song speaks to the nature of growth and change: it must be accomplished in small steps, and we must not be afraid to take them. The lyrics also relate to the way that this book grew on me \u2013 little by little.Also seen on The Readventurer."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg", "userReview": "This book kind of makes my head hurt. Unlike the two previous novels I've read by Mieville, this one takes his outlandish and strange and doesn't put them into their own world, but into ours. Somewhere in our world there are two Cities, they are neighbors to one another and passage between them is strictly monitored and enforced. These two cities are sort of rivals and don't really like each other much, and they actually occupy pretty much the exact same geographical space as one another. The people in the two cities go about their lives seeing their own city and the people and events of that city, while unseeing what is happening in the other city. Can you see why this hurts the head a little bit? Mieville populates the cities with enough real references to give this whole book the feeling that maybe this place really could exist. Some of the people listen to i-pods, a professor states that one of her student's views are too Derrida and Zizek for her, etc. Trying to wrap ones head around the philosophical problems of a city existing this way is difficult, but it's kind of fun to try to do it. What this is all supposed to 'mean' I'm not quite sure. I have a feeling there is some deeper subtext that I'm not quite grasping about the relationship between the two cities, their ways of life and how it would relate to our world, but I haven't been able to really put my finger on what Mieville is aiming at. I feels like it is there though, just sort of stuck in 'the breach'. Philosophically interesting, but as a murder mystery it doesn't really work all so well. As a crime novel it kind of works I guess, but as a mystery there isn't enough information given to the reader to play sleuth while reading the book. The whole reality of the two cities isn't explained enough till near the end of the book for the reader to fully grasp what is going on. I don't know if that's an important part of being a mystery novel, that the reader be able to guess who did what while reading it, but in this book too much is not given, and key characters may or may not appear until the end of the book to alter what really happened. I thought it was a fun read, but I didn't like it nearly as much as Pidero Street Station or The Scar."}, {"userName": "Whitaker", "userReviewDate": "Dec 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1415047-whitaker", "userReview": "For all its police procedural framework, the genre The City and the City reminds me most of is Golden Age SF. This is odd because there is no science involved in this. However, The City and the City does what Golden Age SF did: it takes a \"what if\u2026\" and riffs on it as far as the author can logically take it. What if \u2026 you had a planet where night only came once every thousand years (\"Nightfall\", Isaac Asimov), robots could be implanted with memories (\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\", Philip K Dick), aliens came to visit and fixed all of our problems (Childhood's End, Arthur C Clarke), two countries shared the same physical space but the polity of each pretended the other was not there\u2026 That's Mi\u00e9ville's \"what if\", and he gleefully explores every last street, alleyway, and path it leads down:When an Ul Qoman stumbles into a Bes, each in their own city; if an Ul Qoman's dog runs up and sniffs a Bes passerby; a window broken in Ul Qoma that leaves glass in the path of Bes pedestrians \u2013 in all cases the Bes (or Ul Qomans, in the converse circumstances) avoid the foreign difficulty as best they can without acknowledging it. Touch it if they must, though not is better. Such polite stoic unsensing is the form for dealing with protubs \u2013 that is the Bes for those protuberances from the other city.To grow up in this environment where not seeing what is in front you, not hearing what is next to you, is just everyday life necessitates training the brain to assiduously screen out, to actually subtract from its perception what one is not supposed to see, hear, smell, or feel. And yet one must nevertheless remain just sufficiently aware of these other existences so that you literally do not crash into them. Tourists and immigrants must be trained in this process so that they do not breach these intangible but nevertheless very real borders. In that sense, it's very very well done. There is an amazing chase sequence where chaser and chased are on what is in physical space the same street but in juridical space two entirely different jurisdictions. Both must, to avoid calling the attention of the uber-security force Breach, pretend that each is not reacting to the other while actually doing so:I jumped off the roof of the car and walked quickly after the murderer\u2026. I kept my eyes not on him but looking at some spot or other in Ul Qoma that put him in my field of vision. I tracked him without focusing, just legally. \u2026 The man must have heard the sound of my step. I had come within a few metres when he turned. His eyes widened in astonishment at the sight of me, which, careful even then, he did not hold. He registered me. He looked back into Besel and sped up, trotting diagonally away toward ErmannStr\u00e1z \u2026 This was not, could not be, a chase. It was only two accelerations.The hows and whys of the crimes committed and their eventual resolution are extrapolated logically from this concept of space that is at once shared but separate. As I said, it is very well done. I liked it. However, I did not love it. For all of its cleverness (and I do so love clever), it was only that, an extended albeit very clever \"what if\". The hows, wherefores, and whys of the separate-but-together never added up to more than that. Oh, Mi\u00e9ville gives us the knowing \"aren't I clever\" wink-wink-nudge-nudge from time to time: [The policing conference, \"Policing Split Cities\"] had sessions on Budapest and Jerusalem and Berlin, and Besel and Ul Qoma.Canada makes a showing in a sort of barely acknowledged nod to its Anglo-/Franco-heritage. Way at the back, unmentioned but surely there is the Christian/Muslim divide in Central Europe. The one separation that he doesn't mention but which, given his leftist credentials, one imagines must have been on his mind is the rich-poor divide: our shameful blindness to the poor, the homeless, and the marginal; the way cleaning staff and migrant workers (especially black market migrant workers) are invisible to us.Other knowing conspiratorial winks and nudges abound: The existence of Breach, a shadowy force that enforces the maintenance of Bes-Ul Qoma borders, is his nod to the secret police. Indeed its presence derives much of its sinisterness by suggestion only: from associations we make from the cities' Central European flavour. There is also the possible presence of a third city, an ur-city as it were that is believed to manipulate everyone. Again, Mi\u00e9ville is winking at our stories of secret invisible cabals, the Masons, Illuminati, and other puppet masters of conspiracy theories. These references, while giving us that warm fuzzy feeling of the chummily complicit, are never woven sufficiently into the narrative or the concept of these separated-at-birth countries to make it something more. I could posit that given the slightly anti-climatic ending and the eventual banality of the Big Bad that this is precisely his point. Could be, but if it is he's not done enough work to give that conclusion enough force or life. As with the other references, it's there but at Bes mostly unseen and, sadly therefore, unfelt."}, {"userName": "Gabrielle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753400-gabrielle", "userReview": "More like 4 and a half.If there is one thing you can expect from China Mieville, is that his stories are pretty much impossible to summarize or classify. \u201cThe City & The City\u201d is an amazing and mind-bending blend of P.I. noir and surrealist weird fiction. It starts off is a straightforward enough way: a foreign student is brutally murdered and disfigured, and detective Tyador Borlu, of the Beszel Extreme Crime Squad is assigned the case. Things become complicated when he must team up with a detective from the \u201cneighboring\u201d city of Ul Qoma \u2013 because citizens of Beszel are not supposed to see or hear the citizens of Ul Qoma\u2026 To \u201cbreach\u201d that convention is a serious and harshly punished crime.In typical noir fashion, the motive of the murder turns out to be much more nebulous than originally suspected and it will make detective Borlu question a lot of things about the authority he works for and the structure of the strange world he lives in. But where Mieville goes full weird is when he introduces the concept of overlaying boundaries and realities: to the question \u201cWho murdered this young woman and why?\u201d is added \u201cHow can two cities occupy the same geographical space while still being two different places?\". But once your brain starts untangling this incredible world Mieville created, you are in for a challenging treat.Years of cultural conditioning to ignore or \u201cunsee\u201d people and buildings did not seem that unbelievable to me; we do that about unpleasant things all the time - and I feel like there are plenty of historical examples that could be cited as inspirations Mieville must have drawn on when he imagined his overlapping cities (the Berlin Wall being the most obvious one). I am fascinated with the idea of national and cultural identity, which is what this book really is about once you look past the hard-boiled detective tropes and the wildly surreal setting. Ul Qoma and Beszel are described as incredibly different and unique places: the clothing and architecture of one city are radically different from the other city\u2019s, in order to draw a very clear line between what is part of Ul Qoma and what belongs to Beszel. And yet it is strongly suggested that the cities were not always separate\u2026 As a former archaeology student, I really appreciated Mieville\u2019s exploration of the professional shunning and discrediting that goes with being openly interested in arcane theories about the past of human civilization; I didn\u2019t get past a B.A., but I can easily imagine that embracing more esoteric concepts would stunt a scholar\u2019s career and make it impossible for them to move past youthful enthusiasm for unorthodox concepts. Orciny is the Mieville equivalent of claiming to a thesis advisor that you believe in Atlantis: you will be labeled a nutjob forevermore! That sort of thing happens because it is considered unscientific to believe in what is commonly accepted as myth or folklore, but also because admitting the possibility of such things being facts means we can question everything we think we know about our own history\u2026 and the established academics are not about to rock that boat!I am always impressed by Mieville\u2019s boundless - and yet meticulous - imagination, by how far he pushes the envelope with every novel. He is an urban fantasist, and makes his settings as rich and as fascinating as any character \u2013 especially in this book! As usual, I loved his baroque and poetic prose, and I love how challenged my little brain was by his massive talent. Do not miss this book!(As I was reading \u00ab The City & the City \u00bb, this article about my hometown surfaced, and somehow it felt very \u00e0 propos: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/05/wo...)"}, {"userName": "David Sven", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8802423-david-sven", "userReview": "One thing I'm noticing in my recent Mieville binge is that China likes his cities. They are as much a character as the protagonists of his weird imagination. They have their own unique personalities, differing from book to book whether we're talking about dark and dirty New Crobuzon in Perdido Street Station or the pirate city, Armada in The Scar or Embassytown on an alien planet in Embassytown. In The City & the City we are treated to not one but two cities - or maybe it's one city with multiple personality disorder? And like the title of the book indicates, the central weird idea is even more focused on the cities themselves.In this story, Mieville seems to have restrained himself somewhat to produce a tale set in the \"real world,\" albeit a slightly alternate one to include our fictional cities. If you were to sum up the story you might describe it as a noir-ish police procedural. There's no magic, no human/animal/machine hybrids. Instead, Mieville restricts his imagination to the central concept of cities themselves, to create a metaphor or parable of cities all over the world where there is the city we know, and then there is the other city we know is there but choose to \"unsee.\" This unseen city might be the one the homeless guy begging on the busy street corner lives in - a \"spectre\" of another country in famine which we pass by with our arms filled with groceries. Or it may be the city where the lonely oldy across the road lives in - the one who you never see or hear about till the blue lights wake you up in the middle of the night to carry out the corpse that's remained unclaimed for the last 3 weeks...or months.Again, the plot was nothing special - serving only to frame a central imagined concept that is not quite fantasy, not quite scifi, but still the weird imaginings of the mind that is China Mieville. If you aren't a fan of some of Mieville's more outlandish creatures or if you think Mieville's creations outright ridiculous, you may consider giving this book a shot. You still get a dose of Mieville's wonderful imagination without the peripheral \"over the top\" fantasy come horror weirdness.
