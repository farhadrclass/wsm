Her characters are so real I feel like I know them, like I live in Mitford. The affable, bumbling goofball Father Tim delights me. \"He wanted to say something to her, something to let her know that having her beside him meant the world to him, meant everything. 'I'm going to buy us a new frying pan today.' he said. . . . He hadn't meant to say that. He hadn't meant to say that at all!\" (page 51) He ruined a romantic moment with unintended humor, just one example of his bumbling ways.In Out to Canaan it seems like everything that can go wrong in a small town is going wrong in Mitford, and the general peace of Mitford is disturbed. Good old Father Tim plays detective in many aspects of his life and calling, all the while praying the prayer that cannot fail: \"Your will be done.\"How can someone not love the character-driven Mitford books? They're light-hearted, humorous, and captivating. If Mitford, NC were real, I'd move there. These are books worth reading especially if you desperately need a good laugh."}, {"userName": "Winter Sophia Rose", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32134258-winter-sophia-rose", "userReview": "Heartwarming, Encouraging & Refreshing!

After the melodramatic-ish second book and the deep darkness of the third one, this installment, while the conflict exists and is real and worrisome, is so much lighter. I didn\u2019t own this one til recently and thus was unable to read it as often as some of the others, but that made this reread all the more sweet. Dooley and Lace get their first real interactions in this book, which made me so happy. Father Tim and Cynthia\u2019s marital bliss makes me so happy. They\u2019re not perfect newlyweds anymore, but they have a sweetness to their relationship that I love. Everything about this trip to Mitford was perfect\u2014a refreshing glass of water in the midst of a hassled and darker life. 5/5 stars and absolutely recommend."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1350602-laura", "userReview": "The 4th book in this beloved series. The fact that I have now read four books in the saga of Mitford and Father Tim Kavanagh is testament to the fact that I love these books. Father Tim is one of my all time favorite characters in literature. This loving servant of God tries so hard to be the good shepherd of his charming, lovable, sometimes exasperating \"sheep\". In this episode Father Tim is rapidly approaching retirement and he struggles to tie up some rather frustrating loose ends before he leaves his post. One of those \"loose ends\" is what to do with Fernwood,the crumbling estate left to him by one of his dearly departed parishioners. A real estate developer from Florida has made a very tempting offer to take the decaying structure off his hands, but Father Tim, in an attempt to live up to the dying wishes of it's previous owner, can't quite get comfortable with selling the property to this developer.With his reliance on God for guidance Father Tim finds answers to many vexing situations and in the process has his own faith strengthened. One of my favorite elements in the Mitford books are the quotes used by Father Tim to illustrate a concept or principle of faith. They have lead me to new sources of inspiration and authors of faith based literature. Decidedly a delightful reading experience."}, {"userName": "Kelly ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/872942-kelly", "userReview": "I'm going to write the same thing for the entire series. It's a syrupy sweet old fashioned read which does not demand anything of the reader. Many find the series feel good, and there are some sparkles of true conflict here and there, but mostly it's about the mundane daily plight of a vicar who finds love later in life and saves people - emotionally and physically. If you like the first in the series, keep reading because you will be comforted by the characters and will want to see who is added to the \"family.\" This reads like it was made for a TV series, which I am surprised it has not been made into for PBS yet!What I like about this series is that it doesn't try to be anything it is not; that in itself makes it charming, and if you want to read a simple, feel good, clean series, then this is it."}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27298436-toni", "userReview": "I read this book, and the entire series, quite a while ago; but I recently started listening to them on audio.

In this fourth installment, Father Tim is planning his retirement and getting subtle backlash from his loving parishioners, a new mayoral candidate with a suspicious background does everything he can to sway the vote, a sudden surge in real estate interest from a mysterious company, and a few surprising new relationships. Not only are the happenings in Mitford entertaining and endearing (I laughed out loud plenty of times), there are also some very wise, thoughtful personal reflections as well as dialogue that points to redemption for those who think they are too far gone, hope for almost hopeless situations, and a beautiful example of hospitality and sacrificial love shown through Father Tim and his wife. These novels are wonderful novels to read when I want a somewhat predictable story without any questionable material. It's great having an author you can trust is not going to use gratuitous sensual scenes or language to try to add spunk or drama to her story, but rather, one who is content in her style and carries it through all the novels. This was a charming and life-giving read. It brought up good things to ponder, as the other novels have as well, and made me long for more opportunities to show love and hospitality in our future home -- but also realizing there are plenty of opportunities now in our small apartment as well."}, {"userName": "Maja", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14852843-maja", "userReview": "consistently meaningful series!"}, {"userName": "Diana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1915621-diana", "userReview": "Absolutely delightful fourth book of the series, and even a little mystery thrown in.

Mitford series #4. So far I have loved every book in the series. Out to Canaan covers the final year before Father Tim's retirement. The story is full of twists and turns. The man is busier helping people than ten people! And if it can happen, it happens to him :) Difficulties and roadblocks, the stuff of real life.What can I say? The writing is superb, the characters are indelibly etched in the reader's mind, and there is never a dull moment in Mitford. I highly recommend this series. Smiles, tears, introspective thinking .. this book involves the reader in many different aspects. Out to Canaan is special because Dooley Barlowe has a more active role in the story. It is a joy to watch his character mature. I enjoy Cynthia's role also, and particularly love hearing that she and Father Tim have prayed 'the prayer that cannot fail'.

It's a beautiful continuation of the story of Father Tim and all the citizenry of Mitford. I feel like I *know* these characters, and I definitely love them, even though they aren't really real.
