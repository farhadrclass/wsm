{"ratings": 2, "userreviews": [], "description": "Seattle native Earl James Jackson, \u2018Jack\u2019 to his friends, was just looking to go back to work. He\u2019d finally admitted to himself that he\u2019d been spending far too much time and money soaking up jazz and booze down in the city\u2019s tourist-oriented Pioneer Square district. Moping around like he\u2019d been doing since his last contract tanked wasn\u2019t paying the bills, and his back-up funds were closing in on negative numbers. So he decided he was ready for just about any contract gig he was offered; short of anything illegal or immoral, of course. Well, a guy\u2019s gotta have certain limits. No way, however, did he imagine that this assignment would involve chasing down a paranoid-psychotic mad-scientist-from-the-future killer among the gold fields of 1852 California. Sure, he\u2019d had three or four remote site contracts as a Field Engineer, but this gig was going to be a way out in the booneys. Why not, though? The pay was incredible, the benny\u2019s even better, and it was damn certain he wouldn\u2019t be falling asleep from boredom at his desk. Thing was, except for the very real possibility of an extremely long and very cold dirt-nap, he might not get much rest at all.", "title": "CONTRACT JOB", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37763371-contract-job", "average": 5.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1514518077l/37763371.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12894.James_Fieser", "name": "James Fieser"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37763371-contract-job", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1003899.Scriptures_Of_The_World_s_Religions", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1273722.Scriptures_of_the_East", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1273721.A_Historical_Introduction_to_Philosophy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1273723.Metaethics_Normative_Ethics_and_Applied_Ethics", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4183915-scriptures-of-the-west"]}
