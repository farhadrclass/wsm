Yes.\"\nNo. Please no. I feel like somebody noted the success of books like Gone Girl and the success of Fifty Shades of Grey and thought: wouldn't it be great if we had a book that combined the two? No, actually. No, it wouldn't.The Girl Before failed on so many levels, and I say that as a reluctant fan of these \"domestic thrillers\". I've enjoyed everything from The Girl on the Train to last year's ridiculous but fast-paced Behind Closed Doors. I expected I'd like this one too, but all I got was a weird relationship with \"rules\", another guy called Edward, and transparent twists.The book alternates between the perspectives of Emma (Before) and Jane (After) as they move into the techno-minimalist apartment at One Folgate Street. Though beautiful, there is almost no furniture, absolutely everything is digital, and most bizarre of all - the landlord and famous architect, Edward Monkford, requires that his tenants follow some very strict rules. Both women soon find themselves caught up in a love affair with Edward, but when Jane discovers that Emma died in the apartment, she can't help investigating further.Jane's digging uncovers some disturbing facts about Emma - she expressed concern over Edward's controlling ways to her psychiatrist, her death may not have been an accident, and strangest of all, she looked eerily like Jane herself.Firstly, I don't know what is wrong with these women. Without giving away twists, their behaviour is often outright ridiculous. Warning bells are going off left, right and centre, and they're completely oblivious. At worst, Edward is a murderer, but even at best, he's a creepy weirdo. It's almost comical how much he resembles Christian Grey - not just sexually dominant and prone to \"losing control\" but also strict about Emma and Jane's eating and exercise habits. Ick. Get out. Also, lots of people have a \"type\", but it's just plain weird if your \"type\" are all women who look virtually identical. Secondly, there is no atmosphere. I feel like the author tried to create a \"creepy house with a dark history\" feeling, but it didn't come through because so much of the book was nothing more than a weird romance. I also see how Delaney was trying to create a \"ghost of past lovers\" vibe, but this ain't no Daphne du Maurier. The writing wasn't strong enough to make you scared for the characters, to keep you metaphorically looking over your shoulder.It is often really difficult to distinguish between the two perspectives. I had to keep flicking to the beginning of the chapter to find out whether I was on Emma or Jane. This is partly because the style is impersonal and doesn't deeply connect you with the characters, but also partly because their stories are very similar. As we soon see, Edward takes them to the same places, gives them the same food, treats them the same ways - it was like reading the same perspective twice.And there's a whole bunch of subtle racism going on, as well as a bunch of other distasteful issues. If you insist on only writing about white, middle class people, don\u2019t make the criminals/rapists black and working class. How do you not see what's wrong with that? And casual comments like this (made by a psychiatrist): \"In any relationship there are two repetition compulsions at work - his and hers.\" I can think of a whole lot of relationships where that definitely isn't true.Plus, there's a really poor and insensitive use of rape as a plot device. Without giving away spoilers, someone who was seen to be orally raped is then making jokes about preferring human sperm sacs (to fish sperm sacs - it's a long story, Japanese restaurant, blah blah). Firstly... gross. And secondly... gross.But maybe, even after all of this, I could have been persuaded to up my rating if the ending had provided us with an interesting and satisfying reveal. Unfortunately, I saw it coming from a mile away. The list of suspects is too short; the list of suspects who we'd actually care about it being is even shorter. I'm sorry, but I can't even find anything good to say about it.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9684061-melissa", "userReview": "I\u2019m tossing this one on the heaping pile of books that led me to believe they were worthy of comparisons to Gone Girl or The Girl on the Train, but left me disappointed instead. Is this madness ever going to end? Why can\u2019t a book be left to stand on it\u2019s own merits? I guess it\u2019s my fault for giving in and picking up yet another \u2018Girl\u2019 book. Have no fear though, once again, I\u2019ve landed in the minority, as the reviews I\u2019ve seen have been overwhelming positive and apparently it\u2019s being made into a movie. So, take this review with a grain of salt. It\u2019s just one reader\u2019s thoughts and feelings, after all.Point blank - I don\u2019t get it. This whole scenario is strange. Odd. Completely ridiculous. What sane person would agree to live in this situation? Forget sane - why would anybody sign up for this?Maybe I\u2019m the crazy one, but there is no way I would ever agree to give up most of my belongings to move in to a minimalistic stone box of a house that comes with over 200 stipulations. Restrictive and ridiculous rules. Not to mention, answering a bizarre questionnaire and having my \u201camenities\u201d shut down every time the perfectionistic control freak of a landlord feels like I need to answer yet another series of questions. All in an effort to gauge my \u201cgrowth\u201d or acceptance of the lifestyle the house demands. I don\u2019t care how good looking or how famous of an architect the owner is; I wouldn\u2019t do it. The author sells the idea by garnering sympathy from the reader for the two women and the excitement of top of the line technology - it's the ultimate smart house. Both women have recently experienced tragedies and need a fresh start. And, of course, the rent for this pseudo stone cell is quite cheap. Hmm . . . I wonder why?The story unfolds through the eyes of the two women - Emma, the previous tenant, and Jane, the current tenant. The story flip-flops between then and now, which takes place two years apart, at a pretty rapid pace. We get to see how their stories mirror each other and it\u2019s a little convoluted at times. More than once, I had to go back to the beginning of the chapter to see whose head I was in because I was kind of lost. I liked the whole notion of getting caught up in a story or your past and recreating or reliving that same story over and over. But that\u2019s were the likes kind of ended for me.The entire plot felt like a tangled mess and not one I particularly enjoyed unraveling. Albeit, there was something about it that kept me turning the pages. I can\u2019t say I was wowed though - not by the characters, the scenario or even the twist. I failed to see what so many others have found exceptional about this one.*THANK YOU to Random House/Ballantine Books and NetGalley for an ARC in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Deanna ", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15662887-deanna", "userReview": "My reviews can also be seen at: https://deesradreadsandreviews.wordpr...The Girl Before is a psychological thriller that is getting a lot of attention. The movie rights have even been sold to Universal with Ron Howard to direct. I didn't know any of that when I first read the description for the book. I just thought it sounded like an entertaining read.\"Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.\"One Folgate Street in London, is a high-tech minimalist house with so many cool amenities and features that you would figure the rent would be sky-high. But the rent is actually very reasonable.So what's the catch? Well there's no catch really...Except for THE RULES!!Tenants are required to follow very a list of very strict rules. Things like no pets, paying rent on time, no loud noise after 11pm, take out the garbage. You know, things like that...NOPE...not at all like that.There are over 200 rules that tenants MUST be abide by in order to live in the house.To say that the owner/landlord of One Folgate Street is picky about who lives in the house is an understatement. To say that he's a bit particular about his rules for the tenants is putting it mildly. The rental application is extremely long and includes many bizarre (and impossible) questions.\"A person close to you confesses in confidence that they ran someone over while drunk. As a result they have given up drinking for good. Would you feel obliged to report it to the police?\"Is it worth it to live in such a beautiful high-tech home? This home with its awesome hidden gadgets. A house cleaner comes weekly. The lights, heat and cooling will set to tenants personal preferences. The shower will also adjust to their personal settings. Even the air in the house makes you feel better with its ultrasonic - mood enhancing waveforms.\"Imagine a hospital where the structure itself becomes part of the healing process, or a home for dementia sufferers that actually helps them to remember. This house might be simple, but it's ambition is extraordinary.\"Just don't forget.....the RULES. The main one? NO CLUTTER! Everything has its place, usually out of sight. So no pictures, no plants, no ornaments, no books....wait NO BOOKS???? (OMG!!! that's just wrong!)The owner, Edward Monkford is the architect who built the house. He also lives a minimalist lifestyle. He will not rent unless he finds the perfect tenant. But his need for control goes so much farther than that. And yet... some people are drawn to the \"tormented genius\". But who is Edward really? What happens if someone does break the rules?Emma and her boyfriend, Simon are looking for a safe place to live after a recent break-in. However, their budget is a bit tight and everything is either horrible or too expensive. Then the agent shows them One Folgate Street. She explains the lengthy process for application. Simon is hesitant but Emma feels like the place might be exactly what they need. The rules make her feel secure. She wants to reinvent herself, bring order to her life, to change and be a better person.The house may change her, but will it be for the better?We then meet Jane. After a devastating loss, Jane is looking for new place to live. She wants to make a new start and hopes that One Folgate Street is the place to do it. But it's not long before some strange things start happening. Jane learns some of the dark history of the house and is determined to find out more, especially what happened to the previous tenant.The house may be inexpensive and full of high-tech gadgets, but the walls of the house are also full of secrets. Where is the previous tenant? and is Jane in any danger?\"That's all anyone's looking for really, isn't it? Someone to take care of the mess inside our heads?\"This book may not be for everyone. There is a lot of sex. I will definitely say that some of the characters \"turn-ons\" may be \"turn-offs\" for some readers. It wasn't really my thing and I could have done without those parts. However, it didn't really interfere with my enjoyment of the rest of the book.The chapters alternate between THEN and NOW and are narrated by Jane (NOW) and Emma (THEN). I flew through the pages. Occasionally I had to flip back to double-check whether it was Emma or Jane but most of the time I was able to keep up. The story may have been hard to believe and far-fetched at times, but I decided to try to go with the flow and enjoy it...In the end I really liked this novel. I was pulled and it got right inside my head. I had to know what was going to happen! A thrilling story about a house I would NEVER want to live in, (seriously I could not handle any of the rules) but I sure enjoyed reading about it.P.S Put your shampoo awayThank you, Ballantine Books for providing an advanced copy of this book for me to read in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "1 Folgate Street is no ordinary house, it is cutting edge and won the Stirling Prize. It is an example of extreme minimalism and incorporates the latest home technology. It was originally designed by the techno-architect Edward Monkton as his family home but his wife and son died there which means its now available for others to live. Only there is the slight problem of over 200 conditions that have to be adhered to by whoever lives there. And they have to be interviewed and approved by Monkton personally. The narrative focuses on Emma from the past, and Jane in the present. Both are troubled women. Emma was held at knife point by burglars and she is struggling to come to terms with this. This event drives her decision to apply to live in the house, despite her boyfriend, Simon's reservations. The conditions for residing there will turn her into a new person with more control, Jane has had a stillborn baby and grieving. This house will be her new start and she just happens to fancy the architect. She is receiving a flower delivery of gentians which she assumes is from the architect until she reads the card....and realises there is more to the house than she thought. Emma died in the house.A concerned Jane begins to investigate Emma, the girl before to ascertain whether she was murdered, and if so by whom. There are uncomfortable similarities between her and Emma. From both resembling Edward's wife, to having a no strings attached affair with him which runs a similar if not identical course, to both having risque sex. Jane meets the people in Emma's life including Simon, the aggrieved boyfriend, and Carol, the therapist. Meanwhile, the house appears to develop an entity of its own as strange and random things happen. Is the controlling and manipulative Edward a killer? Is Emma a reliable narrator? An air of menace hangs over the house as danger begins to close in around Jane. The writing is lucid, sparse and beautiful. Pretty much like the house, and there is an air of claustrophobia in the story. This is a house with tragic beginnings and a strong character that is destined to trouble those who live there, you can just feel this. It is a good psychological thriller that keeps you reading without ever losing interest.

The premise is intriguing: What if you had the opportunity to live in the perfect house designed by a famous architect for a low price? The only catch is that the house will record data, and track your every move. Also, the lease will have over 200 clauses, including such things as not leaving anything on the floor and no books allowed!

I can't wait!Wow! Book slump averted! A thriller has not made me this excited since Megan Miranda's All the Missing Girls. The story is told in alternating chapters between Emma, the girl before, and Jane, the current tenant of a very unique flat. While both women are searching for a living situation within their budgets in expensive London, their brokers both mention a possible solution. One Folgate Street has been designed by an architectural genius, Edward Monkford, but in order to live there, one must pass a series of vetting including a multi paged questionnaire and interview. This is where things just begin to get weird. I fear saying much more will give away the twists and turns within these pages. (As an aside, Emma's chapters are told without any quotation marks in the dialogue. While it takes some time to getting used to, it is very effective in differentiating between the two women's chapters. However I am completely curious as to why the author chose to use this device, if anyone knows, fill me in.)I thoroughly enjoyed how the author portrayed One Folgate - the apartment itself takes on a life of its own and becomes a central character in the story. There are multiple triggers within this book. I feel if I mention them here, they would be spoilers. So. Pretty much, if it's a trigger you can think of, it's here.

I expected it to be a very good psychological thriller since it was compared to the \u201cGone Girl\u201d one of the most mind-blowing books I have ever read. Unfortunately, I wasn\u2019t only disappointed. I was frustrated, and let me explain why.This story follows two women Emma and Jane, who wanted to escape the tragic events of their past, in order to begin a new life in a new apartment. The narration rotates between those two ladies, to show us the events of past (Emma) and present (Jane). They were presented to the audience so desperate, that they agree to move to an apartment, at One Folgate Street with weird and ridiculous rules, as tenants. They were so deep into their grief and post traumatic syndrome that they were completely ok by signing a contract with 200 rules such as:No carpets. No curtains. No books \u2013 \nWhat???\nNo pets. No kids. No mess \u2013 I beg your pardon? Who are you to tell me if I have to clean my apartment or not. No, sir no. What if, I want to keep it like that?Punish me then. I bet Jane, the girl who lived there before, would love to be punished.Those rules were not just warning bells, they were warning bombs that had to make those women to run away. But of course they didn\u2019t. No. They preferred to stay in a high-tech apartment and to fall for, \u2013 a perfectionist, a control freak and a creepy owner of this minimalistic apartment -, who have buried his late wife and son in this same apartment. Who knows maybe this minimalistic freak was the same person who killed his family. It was like I was watching a bad version of the Saw movies when the owner of One Folgate Street appeared with all those weird rules and proclaimed that a kind of game has begun. And may the odds be ever in your favour.Then again, leaving in a super-clever-high-technological-environment was quite original and I wanted to enjoy the story but I just couldn\u2019t especially after some crucial moments and messages of the book.One of the most distasteful moments, especially after the events one of the main characters had to go thorough, was:\n\"Yes, daddy. Yes\"\n\nSeriously?\nThis was neither an erotic story nor a thriller. It was an attempt to combine those two genres. Therefore, if you go into this don\u2019t expect those two components.Secondly, both women were presented as weak-willed, indecisive, and obsessive personalities. I can\u2019t stand when books present women as highly dependable individualities, who need a man, in order to change their lives. No. Women are strong, self-sufficient, courageous, and independent. They are responsible for their own fate.The girl before, was exactly this type of book, where both women preferred to be involved in an unhealthy sexual relationship just to feel what? Alive? A bad girl? What I want to say is that they could do a load of things in order to get relieved from the unfortunate events of their past. To demonstrate, they could be involved in voluntary organization to help the women with the same problems. There was an attempt to present one of the main characters in those patterns but I didn\u2019t find it adequate. Identically, they could travel, meet people, learn to play piano, help the planet to become more sustainable. Anything. On the contrary, they assumed it would be more \u201creliable\u201d to play with a rich, handsome, manipulative-daddy to get rid of their memories, pain and even all those traits that made them the people they were.Besides, there were a lot of racism issues all over the story. I just don\u2019t want to give away the plot so please forgive me if the following won\u2019t make any sense. The bad boys of the story were black and working class. Come on. \nSeriously? \n Likewise, there was a controversial issue about people with a Down Syndrome and whereas they have to be born or not. This was one of the main reasons which made me highly disapprove this controlling freak, whose name I don\u2019t even remember.Consequently, this book wasn\u2019t for me.

You MUST SIGN A CONTRACT that states you will never leave a dirty glass out on the kitchen counter, or leave anything out anywhere in the house at anytime. You may not move in anything but your essentials. NOT EVEN BOOKS! Yes, you heard me right, books are not essential according to Monkford.

You may be literally signing your life away.Emma and Jane are our alternating narrators, Emma is THEN and Jane is NOW, so that makes Emma THE GIRL BEFORE. Except, not really.

The story just wasn\u2019t compelling enough to keep me hooked after the first few chapters. It lingers on with the biggest challenge keeping Emma and Jane separate in your mind. Although the audio book is very well done by the narrator, the chapters are way too confusing to listen and follow. I ended up reading the book on Kindle. A minor stylistic point, but what the heck with the way this author writes dialogue? The pseudo named JP Delaney uses the word \"go\" instead of \"said\". No quotation marks either. I\u2019m okay with that, although it puts the action in a passive present tense. Weird. I truly hate reading sentences like this:I don\u2019t know, I go. Welcome Emma and Simon, she goes.English teachers will want to stab themselves in the eye when they read this. Please, please don't let this be a new writing trend!The novel is slick and mildly interesting. There is a twist at the end, thank goodness, but it misses the mark and tries too hard to be cool.

Some days it revs up speed and gains relentless traction.Emma Matthews lives in the \"once upon a gruesome time\". Her spin in the wheel is entitled \"Then\".

One Folgate Street is a state of the art award winning property. The rent is pretty reasonable too, but it's tenants must be prepared to give up all their possessions - no books, throws, cushions, photos, no personal effects, nothing except the bare minimum of clothes. Then there are the other rules - hundreds of them, seemingly waiting to trip you up, catch you unawares. There are also regular questions to answer, very personal and intrusive questions. The fact is, whoever becomes this property's tenant must be willing to be completely controlled.Emma needs to find a new place to live after a traumatic break-in. She can't find anything that is affordable, that is until she finds One Folgate Street. She loves it on sight but Edward the architect, insists on complete control in order to transform his tenants to suit the space in which they're living, and he certainly manages to do that.Jane also needs a new start after a personal tragedy - she too loves the property but is also drawn to Edward, its creator. She soon discovers that Emma met an untimely death in the house, and begins investigating just what really happened there.The narrative certainly kept my attention, I really wanted to know what happened to Emma, but I found it hard to believe in Edward, AND his rules, so really that stopped me from rating this one any higher.*Thank you to Netgalley & Quercus for my ARC in exchange for a fair and honest review*"}, {"userName": "Norma * Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41400192-norma-traveling-sister", "userReview": "If I am rating this solely on my review rating system this book gets no more than 2 stars from me. \u00a0It was just okay and for the most part it wasn\u2019t an enjoyable read for me. \u00a0I listened to the audio version of this book and what I did really like though was the narrators as it was performed very well by Emilia Fox, Finty Williams, and Lisa Aagaard Knudsen.While the premise of THE GIRL BEFORE by J.P.

By \u2018\u2018manipulative,\u2019\u2019 I mean you\u2019re more than pushed into liking specific characters and disliking others. So you do that. But despite having your thoughts about characters shaped by the author, you\u2019re still manipulated some more as the story progresses. I don\u2019t exactly like when that happens. I prefer to be exposed to all facets of someone\u2019s personality and then be able to decide for myself who deserves justice and who doesn\u2019t. This mystery novel is engrossing, despite it not giving us the liberty of making our own opinions on the protagonists and antagonists until the very end. The short chapters surely had their role to play in my being unable to put this book down.It\u2019s slow, partly because it\u2019s a mystery novel. If you\u2019re familiar with the genre, you know that these types of novels take time to pick up because it\u2019s all about the building part. It takes time for Jane to discover someone died in the house and it takes time for Emma to feel scared. That\u2019s when things really become interesting.The death thing confused me, since I thought real estate agents were supposed to disclose info like that \u2013 especially when the previous tenants have died. But I guess there are places where no such law exists. Bummer, but it worked in the author\u2019s favour. I enjoyed seeing this book shift from mystery to psychological thriller. I\u2019m definitely the type to enjoy action in my plots, so I couldn\u2019t do anything else but welcome the darker side of THE GIRL BEFORE, even if it takes time to reach that point. The characters also take time to become important in the reader\u2019s eyes; most likely because they seem so normal, but that\u2019s probably done on purpose to give the effect that this kind of story could happen to you or me. Anyone at all. But don\u2019t worry; it\u2019s very, very unlikely. Sleep tight now.

A restrictive covenant, but affordable. A lot of rules, a harrowing application process. Only if you think it is worth it.One Folgate Street. It was built by a techno-minimalist architect named Edward Monkford. There is an intense 200-question application, a face-to-face interview with the ones Edward personally approves, and even then..they rarely get the lease. And if you do, you have to live by strict rules and adapt to this minimalist lifestyle. It is all in the contract. Things like no children or pets, no curtains or rugs, everything must be put away at all times (including dishes, clothes, etc), no books, nothing left out on floors, no flatbed furniture, etc. Plus you\u2019re required to keep the same cleaning service on, must open the house to visitors for architecture tours, and must take assessments every month to see how you change throughout your stay at One Folgate Street.Not my cup of tea to live under such a strict lifestyle. The two women in this story both went through a trauma before needing to find somewhere new to live on a budget. And One Folgate Street is a house that allows for people to live beyond their means (in terms of rent). Emma and Simon recently had a break in, so Emma needs to feel safe. Emma is the girl from then.And Jane\u2019s chapters are marked now. Jane gave birth to a stillborn and is reeling from the loss. For Jane the house feels like it could be a fresh start. It doesn\u2019t take long for her to learn about the previous tenant that died in the house who looked eerily similar to herself. And slowly, she becomes a woman obsessed and caught up in the girl before.But is the girl before who we think it is? Get ready for some twists. Now re-read my first paragraph. If you have issue with that being dialogue and not having quotation marks, you may not enjoy Emma\u2019s chapters as that is how they are written.

I\u2019m just looking at how it worked into the plot and some scenes felt like added length as they added nothing to the story.The ending felt somewhat tame, though it was still satisfying.

I mean, first of all, it had the word \"Girl\" in the title, which was a clue that it would be bandwaggoning the tail end of a trend. And then, once I finished reading it, I found Emily May's review that made the connection between this book and Fifty Shades of Grey.Here is a list of all of the things I hated about this book:1. Edward. His character was completely unconvincing. I haven't read FSoG and I have no plans to do so. However, that book has permeated the pop culture to the level that even I was able to draw the parallels between his character and Christian Grey. \"I don't do traditional relationships,\" he purred, smoothly. \"I'm coming over, and I'm going to take you to bed,\" he told her (completely out of the blue, by the way). If a man said that to me, I'd meet him at the door with a sledgehammer and a restraining order. Not that Jane would have a sledgehammer, since it's probably a violation of the preposterous rules that she agreed to before moving into the house to have a sledgehammer. 2. BDSM. Never have I been so unconvinced of spanking in a book. Never.3. BDSM. When Emma called him \"daddy\" it literally came out of nowhere. The ultimate sexual non sequitur. Where in the hell did that come from? 4. Emma. Shut your fucking face you lying liar who lies. Honestly, she was one of the most unlikeable female characters in any book ever. She lied about everything. Everything that made her sympathetic turned out to be entirely false. There were three sociopaths in this book, and she was one of them. Are we supposed to like her? I'm unclear on this point.5. Jane. She is basically the equivalent of that dumb blonde in a horror movie who hides behind the wall of whirling knives instead of running the fuck away while she can. 6. It's treatment of trauma was totally surface and entirely based on the author's idea of what some one who has experienced trauma might do. 7. The house itself was entirely creepy and no one would ever live there. People who are alive, and who are not wax statues, do things that create clutter and mess. Even the tidiest house will have, at a minimum, a family photo displayed. Living in that house would be like living in a mausoleum. No one would voluntarily live in a mausoleum before they had actually become a corpse.8. The twist. I figured it out. Go away.9. The dual narrations in opposing chapters. Tired. Trite. Been done.10. The ending. Nice gimmick.So, yeah, there really wasn't anything I liked about this book. I should've known better, really, than to buy it.

Delaney is a 2017 Ballantine publication. I\u2019m just loving these imaginative psychological thrillers coming out recently!!While this appears to be a debut novel, this author apparently has some experience with crime writing, having written this book under a pseudonym. I wish I knew who the \u2018crime writer\u2019 is- but I suppose that\u2019s a mystery for another day. In the meantime, I hear this book might be the basis for a movie, and Ron Howard would be the director! So, if that isn\u2019t enough to peak your interest, I don\u2019t know what will. While this is yet ANOTHER book for \u2018fans of \u2018Gone Girl\u2019 and \u2018The Girl on the Train\u2019, and yes, it does have the requisite \u2018Girl\u2019 in the title, this book stands on its own merits and needs no other comparison.Two very different women, both having suffered emotional traumas, move in, at different times, into a very affordable, unique, technologically advanced apartment that stresses a minimalist lifestyle. The apartment\u2019s owner screens his tenants by having them fill out a lengthy questionaire, and insists they sign a contract promising to adhere to a strict set of rules\u2026 around two hundred of them,(!!!) and if they are not obeyed there will be conseqences. The story alternates between the first person perspectives of Emma and Jane as they describe their time living in Edward Monkford\u2019s apartment building. As the story progresses, we learn the two women bear a striking resemblance to one another, are both attracted to Edward, despite his OCD tendencies, but, Jane discovers that the previous tenant\u2026 Emma, died in the apartment, an apparent victim of suicide. Jane becomes somewhat obsessed with Emma and her backstory, while her own personal relationship with Edward begins to deepen. But, her investigation into Emma\u2019s death could come back to haunt her\u2026.While it may seem obvious who \u2018the girl before\u2019 is, and some may guess correctly, I admit I didn\u2019t see the twist coming and was completely surprised by the way the story developed. The suspense is low key initially, with just a mild creepy feeling permeating the sterile environment the two women live in. But, as the story develops, a feeling of dread begins to grow, and before too long, I found myself immersed in these women\u2019s lives, wanting to send out a warning signal, to advise caution, but didn't know who or what the main threat was. The writing is superb, as the author drew me in, held my attention, managing to evoke feelings of concern for the tenants, on top of creating the feeling of foreboding and dread, that kept me turning those pages. Of the two women, one is more controversial and the other is mildly bland, and were not necessarily people I related to or felt a kinship with, but I did feel sympathy for them and worried on their behalf, despite feeling frustrated with them at times.I was slightly conflicted by the ending, which was somewhat anticlimactic, in my opinion. Other than that, I thought this was a pretty solid thriller, with a unique set up, and kept me interested from beginning to end. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Dannii Elle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44487975-dannii-elle", "userReview": "Second ReadingThis is my first time reading the entire book, as I had only previously read a sampler. The sampler measured in as 17% of the total book, which is quite lengthy portion and definitely had my intrigue piqued. There are so many physiological thrillers available today that sell themselves as in the style of Gillian Flynn and Paula Hawkins. Very few actually come close to living up to the powerhouses in this genre. This book, however, deserves to sit beside them. This dark and brooding tale was alive with emotion and drew the reader into the tension of the tale. The story wasn't set out in chronological order and this provided room for the tale to slowly unfurl, and share its secrets with the reader at its own pace. The telling of the tale, as well as the setting of it, were as alive as the characters, and all three worked together to provide something suspenseful, shocking and totally unique!First ReadingI received this in exchange for an honest review from NetGalley. Thank you to the author, J.P. Delaney, and the publisher, Ballantine Books, for this opportunity.I have never read a sample of a book before and, to be honest, have never been interested in doing so. When I received an email proclaiming that I was eligible for a portion of this book I downloaded it to my Kindle without any real idea of when or if I would get to it. One day, however, I found myself short of time and eager for a quick read to finish, which is how I ended picking this up.I was hooked from the very first page! This sample contains a considerable quantity of the book, containing approximately twenty short chapters, and I flew through all of it in one sitting.Told from the split perspectives of Emma, in the past, and Jane, in the present, this chronicles the similar paths both their lives took once they became the occupant of the infamous 1 Folgate Street. Designed by cutting-edge architect, Edward Monketon, this house is unlike any other. And Monketon requires his tenants to live their life unlike any other, as well.This is the absolute definition of spine-tingling! This managed to make a modern house, full of straight lines and futuristic technology feel like a chilling, Gothic mansion, full of shadowed corners and ghosts of homeowners past. And all without dwelling on any of the melodrama associated with that genre.The no-nonsense style of writing mirrors the architect of the house and becomes just as much a function of the tale as the characters and the setting.I am so eager to uncover the mysteries concerning this unique and compelling thriller and can't wait until I can get the rest of the book in my hands!"}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15055195-gary", "userReview": "The Girl Before is a psychological thriller from JP Delaney, a pseudonym for a writer who has previously written bestselling fiction under other names.

This books tells two stories from two different timelines. Emma and Jane have both lived at the house at One Folgate Street. One Folgate Street is not your average house. It is a house with rules. Lots of rules. Rules that most people wouldn't even want to try to follow. If a potential tenant decides that they want to live in the house, the approval process is quite difficult and most are turned away. Emma and Jane were both approved. Emma moved in the house first with her boyfriend, Simon. Later, Jane moves in and learns that Emma died in the house.Both Emma and Jane were going through some very troubling issues when they moved into the house and hoped the move would give them the fresh start they want. Emma and Jane were both very interesting characters. I wouldn't say that I ever really liked them but I really became invested in learning what happened to Emma and wondered what would happen to Jane. The other key character in this book, Edward, was similar in that I didn't really like his characters but I couldn't help myself from wondering what he would do next.The way this book was laid out really worked well. The chapters alternated from Emma and Jane's point of view with Jane spending a lot of energy trying to learn what had happened to Emma. Sometimes the reader would see something happen to Emma just to have it happen to Jane in the next chapter. Instead of feeling redundant, it just added an extra layer to the story. The more that Jane became obsessed with finding out about Emma the more hooked I became. This was a book that was incredibly hard to set aside.My only complaint about the book is that I am not completely sold on the ending. I do like that the book took a lot of twists and turns that I didn't expect. For some reason the ending felt like a bit of a let down for me. I think that I had expected a bigger scene to help wrap everything up. I would highly recommend this book to fans of mystery thrillers. This book grabbed my interest from the first page and never let go. I look forward to reading more from J.P. Delaney in the future.I received an advance reader edition of this book from Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine via NetGalley.Initial ThoughtsThis turned out to be quite the page turner. I am not completely sure that I liked the ending but this was a very good read."}], "description": "In the tradition of The Girl on the Train, The Silent Wife, and Gone Girl comes an enthralling psychological thriller that spins one woman's seemingly good fortune and another woman's mysterious fate through a kaleidoscope of duplicity, death, and deception.Soon to be a major motion picture directed by Ron Howard.Please make a list of every possession you consider essential to your life.The request seems odd, even intrusive - and for the two women who answer, the consequences are devastating.EmmaReeling from a traumatic break-in, Emma wants a new place to live.
