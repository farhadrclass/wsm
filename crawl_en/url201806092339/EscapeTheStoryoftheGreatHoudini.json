A few years back, I used to be one of those \u2018mature\u2019 readers who steered clear of \u2018Juvenile\u2019 literature thinking it no longer had anything exciting or relevant or exceptional to offer me. Boy, was I wrong. Since getting over my delusional book snobbery, I've enjoyed many wonderful books penned in the straight-forward simplistic language of youthful tomes, often enhanced by illustrations and/or photographs. And it is delightful.\u201cNot long ago the breast pocket snipped from a man\u2019s pajamas (initials HH monogrammed in gray) came up for auction in New York City . . . So eager was the crowd for this fragment of sleepwear that a lofty price of $3,910 was reached before the auctioneer banged his hammer and shouted. \u2018Sold!\u2019\"\u201c Escape! The Story of The Great Houdini\u201d written by Newbery Medalist Sid Fleischman is case-in-point: A delightful entertaining/informative book on Ehrich Weiss (a.k.a. Harry Houdini) enhanced with rare photographs and advertisements, captivating readers of all ages. Fleischman was fascinated by \u201cHoudini, The World\u2019s Handcuff King & Prison Breaker.\u201d In his teen years, as his fascination for magic grew, he became acquainted with Houdini\u2019s widow, Bess \u2013 a friendship that would last until her death in nineteen-forty-three. Eventually then, Fleischman went on to become a practicing prestidigitator as well as an award winning children\u2019s author. So rather than just another book touting facts (facts that can be a bit elusive when it comes to Houdini) \u2013 \u201cEscape!\u201d is more like an intimate look into the Houdini family photo album and diary. And to think, Fleischman wrote this in his eighties. Amazing! \u201cWhile a few contemporary magicians scoff at Houdini\u2019s abilities as a magician, all concede that he had genius as a showman. When the escapist dangled upside down in a straitjacket from the top of an office building, a stampede to the box office followed. That was showmanship.\u201dBorn Jewish, Hungarian and poor, Houdini set his sights on applauding greatness, becoming a self-made showman. And like all showmen, he insisted on being the king of his forte hill. Whatever the illusion: disappearing elephants, walking through walls, escaping from chains, needle threading/swallowing, the Miser\u2019s Dream, movie stunts or airplane gimmicks, Houdini insisted on out-besting his contenders. Mudslinging challengers kept the eccentric Houdini on his ego-driven toes to create ever more mystic acts of danger and intrigue that couldn't be easily duplicated. And being paid handsomely, up to $5,000 per week, the great escape artist could afford to be quite the collector of books and oddities: \u201c. . . he emptied his pockets to buy expensive books, historic documents, Lincoln autographs, and treasures that interested him, such as Edgar Allan Poe\u2019s writing desk. His 5,000 book collection had become so large that he was obliged to put a full-time librarian in New York on his payroll.\u201dYes \u2013 a fun, eccentric good read \u2013 four inescapable stars."}, {"userName": "Brooke \u2665booklife4life\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15928872-brooke-booklife4life", "userReview": "**Short Review**I guess there is pictures in the book but seeing as i listen to the audio i missed out on those :(I will admit i knew almost nothing about Houdini before reading this, i knew about his magic tricks but that's it.

As per the magician's code, the author did not reveal any of Houdini's magic tricks, but rather (the whole purpose of the book itself), Houdini's life. It starts from the day Houdini came to Appleton, Wisconsin to his journey to Europe and back to America. From when he was dirt poor to a high-class magician.I thought the biography was interesting in that I learned many new things about Houdini I had never known. People know the name, much like I did, and what he was great for, but not many know the full extent of what his life was really like, they didn't get to know the 'real' Houdini.

The man is a legend, to be sure. One can hardly breathe the word 'magician' without referencing the escape artist. I knew Harry Houdini's basic story- that the name that gave him such recognition wasn't his birth name, most of his stage tricks, and his death. There were several things I didn't realize going into this biography- one, that he was such a narcissistic, egotistical man, and two, that he seemed to have massive ADD- swapping his obsessions regularly. I suppose it makes sense that he was full of himself. He outdid any other magician of his era, time and time again. Any challenge, he accepted, and beat. I think I might be a little full of myself too. What surprised me was his shameless self-promotion- which, ironically, is what made him the legend his is today. People know his name because he was constantly putting himself out there- on posters, in movies, and in the newspapers. He made sure he was never far from the limelight; which is why he stays there even today, 90 years after his death. The pictures in this book are plentiful and fascinating. It even encouraged me to look up some clips on youtube featuring some of his escapes. I have one gripe here. I did not care for how the author presented the information. It seemed to me as if this method of delivery would have been fantastic if orated- like an old crotchety uncle telling a story about his younger days- than written down in a book. The author wavers. Jumps around. Puts in his own two cents. Goes off on tangents. I understand that he knew Bess Houdini personally, which is why he tells the story the way he does. If nothing else, this author has inspired me to read another book on Houdini- one that isn't so tainted with opinions and doesn't have that old-man-long-story flair."}, {"userName": "Bethany", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3147112-bethany", "userReview": "Escape! The Story of the Great HoudiniSid FleischmanHarper Collins, 2006, 215 pages, $8.99BiographyISBN 9780060850968 This biography gives an in depth look at Harry Houdini's magical life. The author actually met Houdini's widow and has included many pictures that she personally shared with the the author so the book has a unique feel to it. At first, I thought the book would be too elementary to keep my attention since it has large font and many pictures. However, the author's extreme enthusiasm for Houdini becomes contagious. The author starts by giving Houdini's background. Most people know Houdini for his eccentric tricks but few think of him as being a devoted husband who came from a poor, humble family. As the author points out, everything about Houdini was a mystery. Houdini wouldn't even reveal his real birth place! Even the great illusionist's death seems a mystery. You would think that he would have died while doing some amazing, death-defying trick. However, he actually died from a ruptured appendix. Of course, the best part of the text is the description of Houdini's illusions. Whether you believe in magic or not, it is hard to imagine how anyone could manage to unravel themselves from thick ropes while under water or how they could squirm out of a straitjacket while being suspended upside down.  I would definitely include this text in my classroom as a way to get kids excited about biographies. Biographies are often boring but this one has a unique feel to it and will keep students on the edge of their seats. If you like this book, I would recommend The Original Houdini Scrapbook by Walter B. Gibson. It has a collection of Houdini's letters and pictures."}, {"userName": "Carsen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28163730-carsen", "userReview": "\"Escape! The Story of the Great Houdini\" by Sid Fleischman tells the story of Harry Houdini, the greatest escape artist ever known. He was born in Budapest, Hungary before his family traveled to Appleton, Wisconsin in search of more wealth. Later, inspired by the magician Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin, he ran away from home to ease his family's financial strain and begin his career in magic. During his reign as the \"King\" of just about everything he could think of, Houdini married his wife Bess and the two traveled through the US and Europe together. Houdini pulled off stunts like the milk can escape and metamorphosis, as well as walking through solid walls and getting out of just about any lock or jail cell holding him.I thought this biography was a particularly interesting one, partly because of the content and amazing stunts as well as it's writing style. Being written by a former fiction author, it seemed to have that touch of creativity when it came to recounting Houdini's life. His life as well was just very interesting and often raised the question of \"how?\" Overall, I enjoyed reading about Harry Houdini and his stunts, and would recommend the book to anyone who is interested in the topic of magic."}, {"userName": "Wonbo", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12870973-wonbo", "userReview": "Escape!: The Story of the Great Houdini. by Sid Fleischman, Genre: Biography, nonfiction, Pg.206This book about Houdini's life. Harry Houdini, was surprisingly a name he created after the Great French magician Jean Eugene Robert-Houdin. [Houdini means like Houdin] To my surprise, Houdini was not born in America, but in Hungary. Other parts that I liked in this book was the part where Houdini was lecturing to his wife about not to believe in superstitions and later, Bess - the wide, said \"Houdini was so into Friday the 13th, that he would not even go outside\" and the author wrote down. \"Take that, Harry\". This comment just made me burst into laughter. The sad part of the book was his death. Harry, who was half dozing off after he had stayed several days up to nurse his sick wife, was weakened himself, and during a lecture, where he boasted about being in shape and able to take a blow in the stomach, was actually hit four times in the abdomen, which gave fatal damage to his appendix. It was sad watching his stubbornness not going to hospital because he was the great Houdini, which made him sick and killed him."}, {"userName": "JoLee", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/829327-jolee", "userReview": "Featured in \"Historical Nonfiction for Young Readers\" on Intellectual Recreation.

Unfortunately the author of this biography is a magician himself, so he has taken a vow not to reveal any of Houdini's magic tricks. However, Sid Fleischman, who is accustomed to writing fiction, does an excellent job of captivating the reader. Fleischman tries his best to keep the story honest, but I think he had a hard time telling the truth about Houdini, when Houdini himself was rarely honest about himself and his capabilities.While I was impressed with all the things that Houdini could vanish or escape from, I really wanted to know how he preformed all of those illusions. Hopefully this will lead the reader to investigate further in other works. The format for Escape was very nice. There wasn't too much text to a page and it was broken up by photos, some that had never been printed before, playbills and other ephemera surrounding the Great Houdini."}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16994164-kai", "userReview": "This novel tells the story of the author/magician, the Great Houdini.

For me, I didn't find myself getting lost at anytime. The book, overall, was a very pleasing and informing novel that I could not get enough of. I would recommend this book to anyone who's interested in the history of magic, the life of Houdini, or anyone looking for quick and simple read. I would also recommend this book to younger children as well as people who love the history of magic because of how it explains how magic was discovered and gives insight to the life of Houdini. Throughout the story, plenty of literary terms were used; but only a few really stuck out to me. The first being his use of metaphors. In one sentence he writes \"life in a cement mixer\" (Fleischman 29). We obviously know that he is trying to say that his life was all messed up, but the author takes it a step further to keep the reader interested. The metaphors really help the diction more interesting and complicated for the reader. The second literary device I found was imagery. The author says, \"Only then would he muss himself up and pop through the ghost house curtains and face the audience\" (Fleischman 96). He really makes it as if you are sitting front row in the 1920's getting prepared to watch the greatest magician ever do his work before your very eyes. He continues to do this throughout the book and keeps the reader in tact til the very end. My 3rd and final literary device that I found was very important was euphemism. He includes some humor when he says, \"As a young man, Houdini fudged his height on passport documents, stating that he was several inches taller than he actually was. He also tried to look taller in photos by standing on his tip-toes\" (Fleischman 25). Adding a little bit of humor to any type of story can spice up the plot. Adding small amounts like this keeps the novel rolling and keeps the reader intrigued, no matter how early the euphemism is thrown in. Everything from the diction to syntax in this book makes it an instant classic and a timeless read for people looking for a fun and informative non fiction tale about the history of Houdini's magic."}, {"userName": "Richie Partington", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1737220-richie-partington", "userReview": "17 April 2006 ESCAPE: THE STORY OF THE GREAT HOUDINI by Sid Fleischman, Greenwillow, July 2006, ISBN: 0-06-085094-9; Libr. ISBN: 0-06-085095-7The first time I recall coming in contact with magic of any sort, I was a young child who had just walked across the street to a little girl's birthday party. Upon my arrival, a smiling clown greeted me in the driveway by holding up a flower that proceeded to squirt a stream of blue ink all over my brand new white dress shirt. Before anyone in attendance had a chance to explain this bizarre and seemingly most unfriendly of welcomes, I ran home crying to my mother who, after all the ink had finally disappeared, persuaded me to return to the festivities. As Sid Fleischman revealed a decade ago in his autobiography, his own childhood fascination with magic was neither a scary experience nor a passing fad. In fact, upon my meeting him at a book convention years ago, the first thing he did (No, he didn't spray me with blue ink!) was to take a look at my name badge and proceed to tell me about the theater that used to exist in downtown Sebastopol where he once appeared as a magician back in the '30s. Therefore, I cannot imagine a more likely suspect for telling young people the tale of Harry Houdini--the most renowned magician and escape artist of the modern age--than the Abracadabra Kid himself. Having been inspired as a youngster by the legendary tales of Houdini, Sid Fleischman accomplishes three significant feats with his latest piece of writing.Fleischman tells a great story:\"He launched a great buzz when he arranged to be locked up in Cell No. 2 on Murderers' Row of the South Wing of the United States Jail in Washington, D.C. What was so special about Cell No. 2? It was not only that the narrow door stood recessed deeply into the massive brick wall. It was not only that the lock had been installed around the corner, out of reach--some three feet away. It was that a famous assassin had been a resident of the cell for a year and been unable to slip away. He was bewhiskered Charles Guiteau, who had gone down in history as the man who shot and killed President James A. Garfield in 1881. \"Houdini was stripped naked and searched. His clothing was locked in another empty cell. Then he was left alone, except for the eight prisoners languishing in their cells along Murderers' Row.\"Wrote the warden, 'Mr. Houdini, in about two minutes, managed to escape from the cell and then broke into the cell in which his clothing was locked up.'\"At that point in his escape, Houdini 'was seized with a whimsical idea.' When he returned to the warden's office, now fully dressed, he said, 'I let all of your prisoners out.' If the warden were given to heart attacks, he would have had one then. Before he could sound the alarm, Houdini added, 'But I locked them all in again.' Indeed he had--in different cells!\"As I first learned as a little kid when, after seeing the Disney movie Bullwhip Griffin, I tracked down the book BY THE GREAT HORN SPOON!, on which the movie was based, Sid Fleischman is an extraordinary storyteller. Four decades and fifty books later, whether writing fiction or nonfiction, this remains true.Fleischman enjoys language and uses it creatively to make the story even more enjoyable. For example:\"Houdini's sudden fame was written in vanishing ink.\"\"Now that he was back on his home soil, it was time to kick up some dust.\"\"Today's sensation is tomorrow's burnt toast.\"Fleischman conveys important information literacy lessons (such as comparing information sources to determine what is fact) through his demythifacation of the stories of Ehrich Weiss, a.k.a. Harry Houdini:\"In his deathbed, Rabbi Weiss asked his magician son to assume the responsibility of caring for his mother, Cecilia. The scene has the solid ring of myth.\"\"Mark Twain once confessed that he could 'remember anything, whether it happened or not.' \"\"But did it happen? Is it true?\"It's true to the Houdini legend. It's as memorable a prop in the Houdini biography as the cherry tree in George Washington's. If it didn't happen, it was an oversight.\"Fleischman's extensive research, coupled with his own professional background in the field, is well-utilized in separating the truth of Houdini from the legend. And because of Fleischman's great storytelling abilities paired with his creative use of language, readers will find themselves consistently fascinated by both the story of Houdini and the stories behind the legend. While Fleischman, as part of the magician's fraternity, refuses to reveal the secrets and details of Houdini's escapes, he does reward the astute reader with an annotated bibliography containing sources for just this information.Sid Fleischman has assembled a terrific collection of photographs for inclusion in the book. Several were given him by Houdini's widow, who Fleischman came to know when he was a young aspiring magician. Some photos are essential to the tale, such as when the legend-making that Houdini actively practiced to advance his own career is graphically portrayed in the story concerning a picture of Houdini and Teddy Roosevelt.I, myself, am far too happy to be alive with distant memories of all the dangerous stunts I survived during my teenage years to get a thrill out of imagining myself locked in manacles and tossed into a freezing river, dangling off the ledge of a skyscraper upside down in a straitjacket, or threading needles with my tonsils. I nevertheless was glued to the pages of this book. For younger readers this is an exciting and intriguing informational book they'll be sharing with their friends, and maybe an inspiration for attempting the insane and/or the impossible.
