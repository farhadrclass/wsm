If taken slow I feel that any person of reasonable intelligence can understand the concepts that Prof. Einstein puts forth on the laws that govern time and space. This monumental work is, to me, less like science and more like poetry."}, {"userName": "Daniel", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/276352-daniel", "userReview": "This is IT!"}, {"userName": "Erik", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260292-erik", "userReview": "The beautiful thing about science in the original is that, while the results may not always be correct or as clearly expressed as they might be, you do get the original philosophical arguments that led to the theory in the first place. This is especially true of Einstein. To me, he is clearly a philosopher in his original papers, both in his unifying view of things and also the argumentative techniques he uses."}, {"userName": "Bob Finch", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3657860-bob-finch", "userReview": "Reading the original papers that made Einstein famous is a treat.

Though Lorentz paper is barely readable, Einstein writes very elegantly and explains in very simple term his ideas. In fact, today's textbook expositions of Special Relativity are still very close to Einsteins exposition.Unfortunately, it does not work quite as well for General Relativity. Naturally, this theory requires a lot of knowledge in differential geometry/tensor calculus, but also, in the time since Einstein presented the Special Theory, many more physicists joined in the research on General Relativity and Gravitation, and Einsteins later papers on the subject naturally take their ideas and criticism into account. But for the reader it seems like a few steps are missing, especially when it comes to motivating Einsteins field equations for gravity. Then again - a textbook might help!That said, this is a valuable book, and a great read for anyone interested in physics."}, {"userName": "Mafalda", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10878126-mafalda", "userReview": "In 1990 I had to write a paper about time travel. Reading this book was a must.I got so excited about the subject that in the end I wrote two. One on multiple universes and the other on tachyons* (kind of an mental experiment). The latter one was directly inspired by this book, my conversations about it and deep thinking/lots of fun at home.If you really love physics, reading, thinking, and are not scared at some of the maths involved (I still can't grasp half of it) this book is pure joy.*A tachyon or tachyonic particle is a hypothetical particle that always moves faster than light. The word comes from the Greek: \u03c4\u03b1\u03c7\u03cd\u03c2 or tachys, meaning \"swift, quick, fast, rapid\", and was coined by Gerald Feinberg."}, {"userName": "Conrad", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8369331-conrad", "userReview": "The Principle of Relativity is a tough read of a concept that is difficult to grasp. I had the benefit of help and insights from my classmates over the few months we wrestled with Einstein. I admit I experienced several false 'Aha!' moments along the way. Eventually I did manage to successfully conceptualize the fundamentals of the theory before my class moved on, but I had to revisit Einstein's work several times on my own to gain a deeper and more useful understanding of relativity."}, {"userName": "Ibrahim Magdy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15891855-ibrahim-magdy", "userReview": "Include an intro to minkowski space time coordinates"}], "description": "This collection of original papers on the special and general theories of relativity is an unabridged translation of the 4th edition of Das Relativitatsprinzip, together with a revised edition of an additional paper by H.A.
