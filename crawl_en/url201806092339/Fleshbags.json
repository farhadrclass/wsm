Personally, I thought it would have died five years ago, but today it\u2019s still running strong. The zombie is like the vampire. Both creatures are undead, and yet we love them. We love them so much that it might take another ten years before we finally get bored of them, if ever.Fifteen years ago, zombie literature was scarce. Today it\u2019s everywhere. This brings me to Gerald Rice and his short gem of a novella, Fleshbags. The title of this book itself reeks of the undead, and what Gerald has managed to do with this story is not revolutionize the zombie market so much as help it evolve. His undead creatures are a different beast from your typical zombie, and it is really welcoming. What I liked most about Fleshbags, however, were the interesting characters that populate the story. Loman is on a mission to get to his daughter from school and save her from the sudden outbreak that makes people strip naked and their stomachs to look like translucent sacks filled rotting organ tissue. Along the way he teams up with a person who wears all leather and a motorcycle helmet, the latter of which he/she never takes off. Ms. Mila is a teacher at Loman\u2019s daughter\u2019s school who hates the children she teaches. Bill and his wife, Sarah, notice that Mr. Anders is home early from work, which he never is, and that there seems to be something wrong with him. When Bill goes over to investigate, he finds much more than a sick man. I once had a conversation with a friend about how zombies can be used for any metaphor the writer chooses, and Gerald Rice does a marvelous job of doing so in Fleshbags. The story, I thought at least, is about the dark things we store and lock away. Beneath the skin of every individual, there is something darker, perhaps even dangerous, lurking. There\u2019s a secret behind every locked door you pass ignorantly by every day. Not only has Gerald created his own zombie, but he put them in a setting that was easy to believe, amongst humans, everyday people we all know, love and hate. My biggest criticism is that this is a novella with a large cast. It was difficult at first to remember who was who and what they were doing, but once I caught on, it was one hell of a ride. I also would have liked it if some of the subplots were smoothed out more. But don't let these things deter you from what is very much a fun read. If you like zombies and the zombie subgenre, then I invite you to give Fleshbags a try. Do so, and you just might meet some interesting people."}, {"userName": "Steve Chaput", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2965629-steve-chaput", "userReview": "FLESHBAGS is a novella that deals with a new kind of zombie. The title refers to the name given to the creatures by one of the characters, describing the appearance of the undead. I won't say anymore so as not to spoil the story, but the description does do them justice.Rice quickly moves the story by shifting the narration and viewpoint among a group that slowly begins to converge as the action increases. We witness what may be one of the earliest victims and gradually discover what may be causing the infestation. As one of the undead infests another we see how the disease begins to alter the perspective of the next victim until little is left of the character we first met. There is indication that the author may not be done with the concept and I'm hoping that sales and reaction to the book move him to continue.Included is a short-story, THE DEAD CHILD that posits a possible future where the undead are given to families to 'foster', in hopes that a new environment and medication can make them socially acceptable. We see how this situation effects the family of one young boy when a 'dead child' is placed in his home. Chilling, but demonstrates that the writer is capable of more than your standard zombie tale.FLESHBAGS will be available August 23rd on Amazon, Barnes and Noble and Smashwords."}, {"userName": "T.L.", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3291371-t-l", "userReview": "Fleshbags romps and stomps it's way through a grueling 6 hours, during a zombie apocalypse.The novella unfolds by following several groups of people, caught up in different situations, vying for survival. Something has happened. What that something is? Well, it turns folks into rather mindless automatons who want to stagger around naked, biting (but not eating - there's a blessing of sorts) other people and/or dousing them with a clear liquid that...well, read it, you'll find out.It's suspenseful, it's gory, it's gross, and reminds me of the splatterpunk wave that came about in the early mid '90's. Wait til you read the description of one of these things. Ick.Rice has crafted an interesting take on the zombie motif, which jumps from character to character, detailing their travails and triumphs.I like it.I recommend it."}, {"userName": "Veronica Smith", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5686256-veronica-smith", "userReview": "Gerald Rice has fast become one of my favorite authors. I have read all his books and stories and have always been happily surprised as well as entertained. Fleshbags is a newer style of zombies but it just makes it more interesting. Anyone can write a plain old zombie book but Gerald always puts a little extra in his zombies. His characters are great; Ms. Mila and Sentinel are kicked some serious butt! I would recommend anything Gerald has written. They are all so different from each other but I enjoy them all same! You won\u2019t be disappointed. His short story The Dead Child is also included and I found this story very entertaining."}, {"userName": "Janny", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4972598-janny", "userReview": "I quit reading halfway. It really isn't my kind of book. It reminds of The invasion of the body snatchers but that's all there is to say. It's a bit chaotic.

Of course, they would fall into the zombie category, but have some different characteristics, that's for sure. The author has taken time to create a man-made virus that is fascinating in its assault on its victims. The story itself goes from hour to hour of the growing infection, with the elements of confusion and hysteria that come along with it. We get to see where the virus is being developed (and still tweaked), with hints as to why it's been created. We see how far it has spread, or so we think, though once again, there are hints at a larger story at play, with the military getting involved pretty rapidly. There is plenty of confusion and no clear understanding of what is going on by virtually anyone running through the pages of this story, including the victims themselves. Each is focused on their own desire to survive with a lot of the plot taking place in and around a daycare that is close to the epicenter of the virus's release. As I mentioned, it would be tough to call the victims of this virus zombies. They certainly share enough traits with that category of monster, but they still live, or at least retain a level of cognition for a time, that allows the reader to see what is going on inside their minds. The author hints at more hidden beneath the depths of their gory exterior, with expressions on some of these creatures faces that show they seem reluctant to carry out the violence they are prone to perpetrating on the innocent. As the author (and one of the characters in the story) has dubbed them, they are fleshbags. Parts of their anatomy seem to go runny around their midsection, and their skin appears to be more like a transparent bag showing their insides rather than skin. Again, these zombies are different...they act different in many ways, they look different, and on some level, retain the ability to think, if only for a short time. The story itself follows several different characters maneuvering through the northern suburbs of Detroit. I recognized many of the streets mentioned due to my travels in that city. This is a novella-length story, and there are quite a few characters, so we move from place to place and person at a quick pace. There are loose ends at the end, which lead me to believe that this might be the start of a larger project by the author. As a stand alone, it is an entertaining bit of gore splashed apocalyptic fiction that moves at a quick, and sometimes blurred pace. I liked how the author delved into the minds of some of the fleshbags as they transition-they seemed as confused and bewildered as the living surrounding them. I would be curious to see more of this tale, if indeed this develops into something larger from the author. Especially with the so many questions left unanswered at the end. As an added bonus, the author includes two more zombie-centric short stories and excerpts from two of his other long form works as well. The short stories were both non-traditional tales of the undead that were interesting and thought provoking reads for me. Overall, a fun zombie-centric read that make me interested in seeing more from this author."}, {"userName": "Life After Undeath", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9646986-life-after-undeath", "userReview": "Fleshbags (2011) is a novella set during the early hours of a zombie infection. It follows a handful of people as they struggle to deal with the events and avoid contamination.While I have not read many novellas, usually finding them lacking the punch of short stories and the depth of full-length novels, I found that the format suited this story well. It basically reads like a fast-paced movie script. I could easily picture this being turned into a gruesome Hollywood film.I really enjoyed Rice's style. The dialogue between characters was sharp, the descriptions vivid. Some of the more violent scenes were treated with an odd flippancy that made them both awful and entertaining at the same time. The way the zombies themselves were described is something that will stay with me for a long time. Just that alone is worth reading Fleshbags for. It was also satisfy any curiousity you may have about the title.As for the horror factor, Fleshbags definitely has it. It is basically a rollercoaster ride of gore from start to finish. Don't expect any kind of developed plot, a fact that suits this story well. It is pure escapism.I imagine that this would be fantastic entertainment on a long flight, if only as a distraction from the monster clawing apart one of the plane's engines.I look forward to reviewing Tales From an Apartment, a collection of short stories written by Rice and would love to see what he is capable of creating in a longer format as well.Fleshbags gets a well-deserved 9 out of 10 for bloody entertaining escapism. I didn't want to put it down."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14717322-michael", "userReview": "What is Fleshbags? It's a different view of the beginning of a zombie apocalypse. Gerald Rice is a talented writer and while we've read these types of stories before this is one that is wholly original. Instead of following the zombies we follow the survivors as virus and epidemic. This is a horror novel so you do get a few scenes covered in gore and the description of the fleshbags themselves earns an honorable mention. This is a novella only dealing with the first six hours of the oubreak which means there will hopefully be a sequel. Fleshbags is entertaining and well written. If you're looking for a book that will kill a few hours this is the perfect book. Each character is well thought out and the action well paced. Is it just for horror fans? Fleshbags is a novella that will appeal to a wide variety of readers especially those who love zombie fiction."}, {"userName": "Jim Amos", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6652778-jim-amos", "userReview": "Interesting spin on the zombie genre - good pacing and some good character development but wtf it just ends abruptly right in the middle of things.
