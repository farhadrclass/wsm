First, let\u2019s get this out of the way. \u201cHello, my name is Carol and I am a Rose Gardner addict.\u201d Whew! Ok, I feel better now. I have waited for this installment to the series for so long and it was everything I thought it would be and more. My fingernails are chewed down to the nub and I might need high blood pressure medicine now. Denise Grover Swank, I\u2019ll send you the doctor bill. Rose Gardner is loyal to her friends and she will do anything for them. Now, Neely Kate needs her to help to get over her sadness. So what would cheer up Neely Kate best? A good mystery to solve. Rose wants to know more about her mother. She has the journal she kept but she has so many questions. With things slow at her landscaping business, it is the perfect time to get Neely Kate\u2019s mind onto something else but her own sadness so they decide to work together to piece together the events leading up to her mother\u2019s death. Joe and Mason seem to have come to some sort of working relationship but they aren\u2019t telling Rose much of anything as to what they are working on. Joe\u2019s sister, Kate, is still in town and Rose is no closer to understanding what she is trying to do other than to aggravate Rose. \n\u201cIf only I could stay out of trouble. Try though I might, trouble seemed to have a knack for following me.\u201d\nRose and Neely Kate, as usual, get themselves into all kinds of crazy predicaments as they question people about Rose\u2019s mother. The more they uncover, though, the more Rose realizes that perhaps some of these secrets were better left hidden. It\u2019s beginning to look like her mother might have been involved in something unsavory. There are also questions regarding Rose\u2019s father. Does she really want to find out the answers?\nI feel like I got to know Skeeter Malcolm better in this book. He needs Rose to take up her role as The Lady in Black again to help Skeeter get some information. I love how Skeeter doesn\u2019t intimidate Rose, no matter how hard he tries. I know he is the Lord of the Underworld and all but I kind of like him. I like the way he is with Rose. Their relationship, I feel, takes another step in this book. Of everyone involved in her life, it seems like he is the one who is the most honest with her. And Jed, her body guard. I wonder if he has a crush on Rose? He would absolutely do anything for her. Rose is getting better and better control over her visions. She still can\u2019t control it when she has random visions but she is getting better at forcing and directing them. I am concerned, though, with some side effects she is experiencing from them.\n As Rose and Neely Kate investigate her mother\u2019s past, Rose begins finding threatening notes on her truck. And someone tries to run her off the road when she is in Mason\u2019s car. Were they trying to hurt Rose or did they think it was Mason? Are their lives in danger? This was such a good book. Rose and Mason seem stronger than ever but there are so many secrets. And Rose just can\u2019t seem to keep herself out of trouble. I realize this is an ongoing series but I completely DID NOT expect that cliff hanger ending. I might have shrieked out loud! I am still shocked! So now the countdown starts until November when Thirty-Five and a Half Conspiracies comes out. I don\u2019t know how I will ever make it."}, {"userName": "Jamie Davis", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11968352-jamie-davis", "userReview": "Holy Crap, THAT just happened!How on earth do you write a review for such a powerful book without adding spoilers? EEP! Denise Grover Swank brought the Rose Gardner Mysteries to another level of intensity! Thirty-Four and a Half Predicaments brings our favorite characters out in full force. Neely Kate and Rose dig themselves into another mystery as they attempt to decipher Dora's journal. Rose is determined to find out what happened to her biological mother, and as any Rose fan knows, digging into Fenton County's secrets leads to trouble. Skeeter and Rose are forced to redefine their relationship on more than one level when their investigation takes them into his territory. Rose alone is capable of corralling Skeeter's temper, even when she's the one that ignites it!J.R.'s evil plots make him a powerful presence, and the effects of his scheming are far- reaching. His character still invokes fear without ever needing to make an appearance, and he taints every person he touches in some form or another. I think Rose Gardner readers are all waiting breathlessly for him to \"get his\" in retribution for all the pain and misery he's caused for decades. He's certainly the epitome of evil, and you can continue to despise him in this book as well. Denise is truly a gifted author, and it's evident as always with this book. As one mystery comes to light, another grows from the shadows. The web of secrets continues to grow, yet we understand precisely what we need to in order to continue our Rose Addiction and still be clamoring for more. The humor, the emotional anguish, and the relationships that continue to grow allow you to connect to the characters on a deeper level. When you finish a book written by Denise, you can't help but feel like you're leaving behind friends. If you want the truest definition of a book hangover, then read Thirty-Four and a Half Predicaments. You'll be on the edge of your seat dying for more even as you flip the last page!"}, {"userName": "Jo Ann Reinhold", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11617106-jo-ann-reinhold", "userReview": "Thirty-Four and a Half Predicaments: Rose Gardner Mystery #7\"Some Secrets are better in the past\" -Denise Grover SwankFirst let me say that I was lucky enough to receive an advanced readers copy of this wonderful book but that fact has no bearing on how I feel about it....I love this series and the wonderful author who puts her heart into these stories.If you are a follower of the Rose Gardner mysteries then this is truly a can't miss book!

I might have said this about the Ripple of Secrets novella at some point, but that simply laid the groundwork for what happened in this book and beyond! If you are a fan of the Rose Gardner Mysteries, you cannot miss this book. Too many important things happen. It\u2019s not a one-off \u201cmystery of the book\u201d story, but explores Rose\u2019s past with information that has ramifications on her future\u2026 especially where JR Simmons is concerned.Things are changing for pretty much everyone. In a nutshell, this is my takeaway on what goes down: Neely Kate has to deal with a devastating loss. Rose, Neely Kate and MILDRED (yes, President of the Busy Body club) form a surprising alliance in an effort to solve a mystery\u2026 and hilarity ensues! Hilary continues to be as uppity, nosy, and harassing as ever. Kate is as mysterious as she is persistent\u2026 I just don\u2019t know whether or not to trust her. Skeeter demands his time with the Lady in Black and she gives him a piece of her mind. Rose uncovers dirt from her mother\u2019s past that put her in danger. Then all hell pretty much breaks loose as Joe and Mason both have their own problems to deal with.Predicaments gives all of my favorite characters a bit of face time, while also upping the ante with the JR Simmons mess (and it is a mess, given that it stretches decades and crosses lines with pretty much everyone you can think of.) The ending comes with a few revelations that are both shocking, yet somehow expected given the situation in which Rose, Joe, and Mason have gotten themselves entangled. My one issue, and not enough to take even a fraction of a star away, is that I believe Joe and Mason should have let Rose know exactly what they were doing from the beginning of their \u201cpartnership\u201d to take down JR so that her own actions wouldn\u2019t interfere with their plans. I believe what happens at the end has far more to do with Rose\u2019s meddling than it does anything Joe or Mason were doing behind the scenes.Predicaments is funny, exciting from start to finish, and just all around fantastic. May I give this book 11 stars? 20? 100?! This book explored more into the mythology that has been a low roar behind everything since the second book. AND I LOVE IT! Thank you, Denise, for giving your fans a chance to read this story in advance! *****FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND STARS*****I received an ARC in exchange for an honest review, but let\u2019s be honest\u2026I was going to read and review this bad baby whether or not I got an advanced review copy! *fangirl* :)"}, {"userName": "Monique", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23498832-monique", "userReview": "Firstly, let me just say, anytime I get to read a Rose Mystery, is a happy day for me. And this book made my day! If you have never picked up a Rose Gardner Mystery, then you can start with this book but you are definitely missing out on a brilliant series. This is number seven of the series and there are three novellas as well. If you have already started this series, then you are sure going to love Thirty-Four as it is jammed packed. Denise's writing is pure magic with this series and this book in particular. It falls under the Mystery / Women Sleuth category but you could add romantic comedy as well. In Thirty-Four, Rose is at a loss as to how she can help her best friend Neely Kate recover from depression. One attempt is to take her to the Hair Salon for some pampering, which does cheer her up, but not as much as running into Hilary there and Neely Kate ripping into her. Rose then decides that solving a twenty-five year old mystery is going to keep Neely Kate occupied. The two of them set off even with Joe's blessing, as how much trouble can they get into? Rose and Neely Kate, have a great banter and they join up with Miss Mildred, Rose's old neighbour. Neely Kate has so much fun at Miss Mildred's expense, you will be laughing out loud like I was. Others from previous books are back too. Skeeter is still the current Crime Boss and uses Rose's abilities again as the Lady in Black. Joe's sister Kate is still in town, popping up at odd times. And of course there is Mason, Rose's Assistant DA boyfriend. Their relationship is getting stronger ever day and they are even talking about marriage down the line. Mason is still looking into saving Rose from false allegations that Joe's father JR made up. These two will do anything to protect each other. Rose, with Neely Kate and the White Tiger aka Miss Mildred, get themselves into some funny predicaments and a little bit of danger before they uncover the mystery. I didn't not see the ending coming, as I am sure most won't and I will be waiting on tender hooks for the next book which is due in November, 2015."}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6703235-ian", "userReview": "Two decades earlier, Rose's mother died in a car crash. The police at the time decided it was an accident and the case was closed, but Rose has good reason to believe her mother was murdered. As she investigates she uncovers a web of lies and corruption that stretch all the way to the present day and the people who are closest to her. Book 7 of the Rose Gardner series is close to the best. I've enjoyed them all, they're entertaining fun reads but apart from book 1, Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes I wouldn't say any of them are brilliant. Until now.

I am loving the development and growth of all the characters. The 'in-between' novellas have been fantastic to add a little extra background and to keep our thirst for the next novel satiated for a while. My review is a brief of all the characters in the present as I don't want spoil it for any future readers....I will start with the emotional scenes with Neely-Kate and Rose: they are just beautiful and handled so delicately as these are real life situations that do occur in the real world to real people. The depth of emotion and tact and Rose's feelings of apprehension to discuss the loss or even what to say to Neely-Kate have been written so well. I also liked the little snippet of the happy Neely-Kate come through when she exclaimed \"Ding dong\" about Bruce Wayne.I really like Mason and his relationship with Rose but I really don't think they are going to last the pace; I smell something is brewing! I get nervous whenever anytime I read Mason's name, which is a lot, as the deeper he is digging on his mysterious case the more secrets are being exposed!Joe: there is nothing I can put here that won't spoil it for anyone who hasn't read the book yet. I still like him. I believe there is more depth to his character than DSG is writing in her books at the moment. Again, there will be another twist for us.Bruce Wayne: I am really enjoying the growth of his character. He is starting to believe in himself, even if it is a little at a time, since Rose awarded him a partnership. He is a genuinely nice guy and he deserves to get the nice girl. I look forward to reading more about the growth of his and Anna's relationship. He deserves someone lovely to be with.Rose: she cannot help herself with all her noseyness into other people's business but also into her own affairs. I am pleased some questions have been answered but not too many as I like the slow build up! Her character has developed brilliantly since \"Twenty eight and a half wishes\". I like how strong she is as a person and does not seem to be afraid to speak her mind. I like her relationships with Joe and Mason but I love her relationship with Skeeter Malcolm and I look forward to reading about more developments in the next book. The question of her paternity has been a bit muddled, even though there appeared to be answers in this book, I am wondering if there will be another twist for us? I do, however, think there are going to be a few more surprises the next book. Skeeter Malcolm: I love him! His character is great and who doesn't love a bad boy?!!! The relationship he has with Rose is confusing him as he cannot control her like he controls everything/one else in his life. Rose shows courage and daring with the way she talks back to him without any fear! I love how sweet and caring and taken by her he is, even though he always has an excuse why. He is as surprised as Rose is with her business acumen - especially for dodgy business!All that is left to say now is: WHAT AN ENDING!!! I can't wait for Thirty five and half conspiracies!This is a fantastic series that just keeps growing from strength to strength!

It surprised me, that after the previous 6 novels ending so well that this one ended as it did. There were so many unanswered questions and then to just end it 'cliffhanger style' is so not cool and very unlike the others in this series. I generally love everything about this series, the characters, their troubles, and how they get intertwined together and figured out. I've been reading this series since it began, read all of the in betweens, and the wait until the next full novel to come out is always way too long. The wait for book 8 is going to be painful! This book, #7, took some things to a whole new level...in both a good and bad way. Let's quickly talk about Skeeter Malcolm...am I the only one that wouldn't be upset if Rose 'got together' with him? Sure he's a bad guy, but he's no JR! Rose would be good for SM and would make his heart 2x bigger! Mason would get over it, and I'm not really sure that I like Mason so much anymore, but I always have been a Joe fan even if that ship has sailed as the end of this book may have implied.The plot of this book was very complex, not difficult to follow, but a ton of different angles to it. How things connect: who's leaving her/him notes and why?, Roses birth mother to JR, who's her daddy?, did her mother do something bad?, who's out to get Mason? the list goes on... I couldn't stop reading I wanted to know all of the answers!Incorporate all of that along with Neely Kate's recovery, Joe's sister appearing, the new nursery worker, Jed, and other and you have a recipe for an extremely filling and satisfying novel.Loyal readers of this series love getting their endings fulfilled and anxiously awaiting the next in series to find out what new shenanigans Rose and friends are getting into. They consider this a quick witted, light hearted read even if the situations are not always so light, the happy endings make up for that. This book was also riddled with 'filler'. Since there is so long intween books I sometimes need a refresher, I don't mind a little filler from the previous book, but this one had filler going back to the beginning of time and very frequently placed. I felt that 7 books in this amount and frequency was unnecessary and found myself skipping pages to get to the book 7 stuff. If someone is starting this series on book 7, they should be left in the dark and confused, yet enticed enough to go back to book 1 and read through the series like everyone else. If this filler had been left out there would have been more pages to fill with answering the questions that are most likely going to be closed out in the next book and this book could have ended successfully and not made me want to scream and throw my iPad!I like this series, but hate cliffhangers. Again, I'm holding out hope that the author is going to redeem herself in the next book and is not finding herself being sucked into the leave 'em hanging style of writing to make more money, at $5+ a pop I can find something else to read that will be just as satisfying.Even after this, I have to say... if you haven't read this series yet, I would encourage it!"}, {"userName": "Melanie Hodges", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40151110-melanie-hodges", "userReview": "Curiosity killed the cat! First of all, there should be an option to rate higher than 5 stars, but then where would you stop on this occasion? Thirty four and a half predicaments follows on from Ripple of Secrets so if you haven't already read that, STOP NOW and read that first or this won't make much sense, especially when it comes to Neeley Kate. Without giving the story away, this book gives all the characters we've grown to know and love their own important role to play. It involves Rose trying to find out more information regarding the truth about her birth mother. However, nothing is ever simple with Rose is it. The more she uncovers, the deeper the lies and more complex the situation becomes. It's a good job she has her best friend and partner in crime Neeley Kate to help her solve the mystery. There are other problems to consider, nonetheless the unravelling of the evil J.R Simmons who seems to have more fingers in pies than I ever thought possible! There are some fabulous twists in this 7th book in the series. As soon as you think one thing is happening, it turns out to be something completely different and surprising. I will say that I really enjoyed seeing a different side of Skeeter, but to say more would be telling so I'm afraid you'll just have to buy the book and read it yourself. If you've been reading this series this is an absolute MUST READ!

I tried to do that with this latest installment but found myself unable to put the book down and had to finish it. This 7th novel is the MOST suspenseful of all the previous books and I greatly appreciate how Denise Grover Swank is spinning this complex tale of conspiracy and secrets. In my imagination, she has a huge whiteboard at home with flow charts that make the subway system look simple. For all the people angry about the cliffhanger ending, I say chill out. It's not the end of the series; it's just building towards an explosive next book. Even if most of the other books were stand-alone novels, rather than feel cheated out of a finite ending, why not be excited that the mystery is getting even deeper and more complicated. Writing books is about more than happy endings and making everyone feel good. Sometimes authors need to do what is best for the story, to drive it forward and keep it going and growing. If you've read 7 books in the series, chances are pretty good you'll read number 8 and when it comes out, I suspect the plots will be so deep, we will be mind-blown. Denise Grover Swank continues to be one of my favorite authors and as long as she keeps writing Rose Gardner books, I'll keep buying and reading them.

This book was an amazing ride, so many great things that I want to share and I will try to do so without giving away any spoilers!Rose is a true gem, she is a superstar among book heroines in my humble opinion. She has really grown throughout the series and this book is no different, she's willing to stand up for what she believes in and will not be intimidated, even by the likes of Skeeter Malcolm or Hilary Wilder. As she digs into the life of her birth mother, many unsettling things are thrown at her and she continues on with courage ensuring the truth is uncovered.Since there were some pretty serious issues being dealt with by the characters in this book, I especially enjoyed the humor and laugh out loud moments that came from none other than Miss Mildred, I know it's hard to believe but you'll love those scenes as well!The men who love her are still front and center in her life, and as much as I want to say about this, it's pretty clear to me that Mason is a man that would do anything for Rose and go to the ends of the earth to do so.And last but not least, the ending....it's one that will make you say \"NO\" I need more, what's going to happen next, and I have to wait until when for the next book...all I can say is it's going to be a long torturous wait to find out what is going to happen next, where loyalties lie, and who will save the day :)"}, {"userName": "Cassie", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9726784-cassie", "userReview": "WHAT A BOOK!!

Denise Grover Swank has created characters that the reader cannot help but connect emotionally with, and as the storyline progresses you are dragged (willingly) with them through sorrow, joy, confusion, love, betrayal, hope, and fear, with a large dollop of humor along the way. I love the way Rose has blossomed (sorry) and grown in all aspects of her life during this series. In this book she is making more reasoned choices, discovering who she is, what she needs and wants, and trusting herself more. Her relationships are complex, rich, and real, and that's what attracts us, the reader, as well as every semi-decent character in Henryetta, to her. Simply put Rose is an extraordinary person who keeps getting into extraordinarily dangerous situations, while dealing with love, friendship, family, and the prejudices of an entire town.Thirty-Four and a Half Predicaments is the best book in this series so far, and that is saying something as it is the seventh one, and I didn't want to put it down. This story is one exhilarating ride that will leave you gasping for breath when it's over, and believe me, you won't be able to wait to do it all over again!I received an advanced copy of this book in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "little 'ole me", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26420405-little-ole-me", "userReview": "I settled down read this latest installment of the series and got so carried away that when I finished I have had to go back and re-read the book as i couldn't get my emotions into check to write a comprehensive and understandable review.....2nd read has no happened and i can now write with a little more clarity and less emotions!The 7th installment doesn't let you down from the stylish front cover of the book to the classy writing from Denise, Rose and her gang are up to their own shenanigans in this book. we see some more depth to characters who have just joined the series and we are left wondering how they are going to be intertwined in the story and then we have characters who we know are wrongun's but we still love them and can reason in our own heads as to why what they do is ok! it also has some very sad scenes which cant help but bring tears to your eyes.the last chapter was a fast page turner and i was left bereft when it finished, i now have to wait until November for book number 8."}, {"userName": "Stef", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5562268-stef", "userReview": "Crazy good story.

Totally heartbreaking. Leave it to Rose to help get her out of the rut by trying to find out information about Rose's birth mother, Dora Middleton. I am happy to say that the Lady in Black makes another appearance in this book also. I don't know why I love the scenes between Rose and Skeeter, but I do. Right there is about all I will say about what actually happens in the book. There are so many shocking twists and turns that you don't see coming. I will tell you that the entire time I was reading it, I was so caught up in it all that I was tense and felt like I was holding my breath, waiting to see what the next sentence was going to bring. I don't think it's to soon to be saying, PLEASE Denise Grover Swank, how soon can we get the next book? I need it!I was given an early copy of this book in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Theresa Kay", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26290182-theresa-kay", "userReview": "This series just keeps getting better. This installment has a great mystery and \"edge of your seat\" action, but it also has some laughs and some major feels. Rose's chracter growth is one of my favorite parts of this series and in Thirty-Four she just amazes me even more. She is able to remain steadfast and loyal without being a doormat. Some of my favorite parts of this book were when Rose was facing off with people, especially Skeeter. I adore the dynamic between the two of them. Mason is just as sweet and wonderful as ever and I loved seeing how his and Rose's relationship continues to deepen. The new questions that are introduced and the \"OMG I can't believe that happened\" ending have me super anxious for November to come so I can read the next one.** I received and ARC from the author in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "Sandra Lancaster", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25041773-sandra-lancaster", "userReview": "I received an ARC (advanced readers copy) of this book for my honest review.Denise does it again!

I absolutely love this series and this book is just amazing. These characters have managed to get into my heart and some (like Hillary) under my skin and I loved every minute of it. I feel like this book was a bit more intense than the others, but still had plenty of lighthearted moments only Rose can bring to situations. Some of my favorite passages were those with Rose and Skeeter - so well done by the author! The ending left me stunned (no spoilers here!) and I can't wait for the next book in the series.

I'm not sure how this is going to shake out, but I'm pretty intrigued. There's also so much going on with Joe. I know that Rose is with Mason, and he's pretty cool, but I don't know...the Joe thing isn't entirely resolved. The end of the book worked better for me than the beginning, and I'm sure there must be something more going on than is apparent, but I cannot for the life of me see any hints as to where the next story will be going (which I love). I'm only sorry that I've caught up to the end of the series so far, and will now have to wait for subsequent books to be published before moving on to the next episode.

So when Rose stumbles onto a piece of evidence indicating her birth mother might have been involved in a crime, she does the one thing guaranteed to cheer Neely Kate. She convinces her friend to help her solve a mystery. Though their penchant for investigating has gotten them into plenty of pickles in the past, what can go wrong if they\u2019re looking into a case that went cold a quarter of a century ago? But the deeper they dig, the more dirt they unearth. While she\u2019s busy unraveling the past, Rose must also reprise her role as the Lady in Black as part of her ongoing agreement with the king of the Fenton County underworld. In so doing, she discovers a mysterious enemy is intent on attacking her friends, and her assistant DA boyfriend might be next on the list. As both situations reach a boiling point, Rose must face the possibility that certain secrets were meant to remain buried and not even her special talent can get her out of every predicament.", "title": "Thirty-Four and a Half Predicaments\n      \n          (Rose Gardner Mystery #7)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments?rto=x_gr_w_carousel_bp", "average": 4.5, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1432380257l/24778061.jpg", "reviews": 275, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4921525.Denise_Grover_Swank", "name": "Denise Grover Swank"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Romance", "Suspense"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23700728-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25451975-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22847270-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23290347-the-substitute", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25860522-after-math", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications"]}
