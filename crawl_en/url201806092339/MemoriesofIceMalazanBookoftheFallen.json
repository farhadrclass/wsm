My husband has arrived! \nThe Tiste Andii had gathered into a silent ring around the central clearing, awaiting the arrival of their master. The black, silver-maned dragon emerged from the darkness overhead like a piece of night torn loose, flowing down to settle with a soft crunch of talons in the plain's stony soil. The huge, terrible beast blurred even as it landed, with a warm flow of spice-laden air swirling out to all sides as the sembling drew the dragon's shape inward. A moment later the Son of Darkness stood, cloaked, framed by the gouged tracks of the dragon's front talons, his slightly epicanthic eyes glimmering dull bronze as he surveyed his kin\nI love him \u2764\ufe0f\nThe sword, yet more than the sword. Dragnipur in the hands of cold justice, cold and unhuman. Anomander Rake, the only one among us whose presence sparks fear in Kallor's eyes . . . the only one . . . except it seems, for Silverfox - for my daughter. What might Kallor fear most, if not an alliance between the Son of Darkness and Silverfox? Kallor's voice boomed. 'Anomander Rake! I seek your clearest vision-I seek the justice of your sword-allow none to sway you with sentiment, and that includes Korlat, who would now whisper urgent in your ear!'The Son of Darkness, a lone brow raised, slowly turned to regard the High King. 'What else, Kallor,' he said in a low, calm voice, 'keeps my blade from your black heart . . . if not for sentiment?'\n****\n'This strides too close a path to the Crippled God for it to be accidental, Rake. The Chained One's poison is that of Chaos, after all.''Aye,' Rake smiled. 'Curious, isn't it? I think there can be no questions of who is using whom--''Maybe.''Dealing with the Pannion Domin will present us with formidable challenges.'Brood grimaced, 'As the child insisted, we will need help.'The Son of Darkness frowned. 'Explain, please.''The T'lan Imass, friend. The undead armies are coming.'The Tiste Andii's face darkened. 'Is this Dujek Onearm's contributions, then?''No, the child. Silverfox. She is a flesh and blood Bonecaster, the first in a long, long time.''Tell me of her.'The warlord did, at length, and when he was done there was silence in the tent.\nGOD! I freaking loved this book so much! It was so much better than the first two! They just keep getting better and better. Although, I do know there is a book coming up that I am dreading. I fall more in love with these characters every time I read about them. We are finally back to where we started in the first book with the characters I know. Now a couple of peeps came from the second book but not too much. I'm guessing they are all going to be together at some point if they don't all die before then. I really loved the character of Silverfox. She was brought back from someone that died in the first book. I'm not saying anything else about that though. And we all know I loved Rake being back in the book. But those are not the only characters. Whiskeyjack, Picker, Blend, Dujek, Quick Ben... ugg there are just so many. You can't help but fall in love with them and this story. At least I can't. The ending was freaking sad! Jesus, I know that he's going to make all of the books have sad endings and we are going to lose so many more of the people that we love. But then again, some do come back but not necessarily as who they were before. I don't know. I do know that Mr. Erikson can break a heart and he's going to keep breaking mine until it's totally gone. I'm so happy that I found this series through my friends on Goodreads though! Happy Reading!

What was I thinking! This deserves to be rounded up to 5 stars!!! But the pain.... Just as painful and potent as the first time! __________________________________*** 4.35 ***A buddy read with my family and friends at BB&B! Because we love Fantasy and are a bit of masochists too... \n\"...\"And the fact remained, whatever games the gods played, it was hard-working dirt-poor bastards like him who suffered for it.\u201d...\"\nEpic Fantasy of this scope deserves a better reviewer than me... I get so overwhelmed not only by the plot-lines and multitude of emotions the cast of characters brings on, but from the experience as a whole, that I loose the ability to break everything down in a logical and concise way. Thus I usually give up and go with the emotions the book invoked in me rather than bungle my way through a real critique. \n\"...\"The world is shaped like a beetle\u2019s ball of dung, and it travels through a chilling void around the sun. The surface floats in pieces, on a sea of molten rock. Sometimes the pieces grind together. Sometimes they pull apart. Pulled and pushed by tides as the seas are pulled and pushed.\u201d...\"\nThe book does not seem that long when you look at the page count. 920 pages is a lot, but I tend to read books of this length in 2-3 days max and not even think about it. However, by this time we have become well acquainted with Steven Erikson's style of writing and it is as dense as they come, thus making the most of every page, not letting your mind wonder in moments of lull.. You don't even realize how much our brains count on those moments of slow-down and light content in books in order to process the information as a whole without feeling overwhelmed with data by the end. No wonder some of my fellow readers feel like they need to get a college credit after finishing every book n the series:):):) Well, despite the scope of the novel, Erikson has found a way to keep us involved in the lives of all sides of a conflicted alliance between very reluctant frenemies. However, the enemy of my enemy is my friend, becomes the basic stepping stone in this book. And just as in the book before, although in a very different way, death.... A lot of death....\n\"...\"\u201cDeath and dying makes us into children once again, in truth, one last time, there in our final wailing cries. More than one philosopher has claimed that we ever remain children, far beneath the indurated layers that make up the armour of adulthood.\u201d...\"\nHere in \"Memories of Ice\", we are back with the company of Dujek Onearm's Host, Whiskeyjack and Captain Paran with the Bridgeburners, making alliances with Caladan Brood with his army and the dubious Kallor, the Tiste Andii led by the ever awe-inspiring Anomander Rake, and a bunch of mercenary armies, all with the purpose of stopping the hungry, cannibalistic masses of the Pannion Domin, led by the Pannion Seer. The action is happening at the same time as the events form the previous book but on Genabackis instead of the Seven Cities. So, little communication exist between the Adjunct Army, the Malazans who are involved in the Storm of the Apocalypse, and our bedraggled host of Bridgeburners, apart from the delivery service which supplies both at an enormous cost but with mind-blowing ability!!! \n\"...\"We humans do not understand compassion. In each moment of our lives, we betray it. Aye, we know of its worth, yet in knowing we then attach to it a value, we guard the giving of it, believing it must be earned. T\u2019lan Imass. Compassion is priceless in the truest sense of the word. It must be given freely. In abundance.\u201d...\"\nThis book was easier to read, mostly because of our familiarity with the way SE tells a story and the return of well-liked characters from book 1. However, we have a ton of new and wonderfully enchanting characters, which I think made this book work. Lady Envy with her entourage were some of my new favorites, a very horny Barghast warrior lady, the Shield Anvil - a warrior with a heart full of empathy big enough to take the pain of many suffering souls, and a couple of female Bridgeburners who steal your heart with strength, banter and hidden vulnerability, which made me fall in love with both of them at the same time!!!! However, as far as old favorites go, this was the book where the true character of Whiskeyjack shone in all of its glory with its humanity, nobility and strength, while Kruppe was the light of the bunch and where SE shows his chops as a writer, in my humble opinion. I think if it was not for him and the ladies, this book would have been like a load-stone on your heart. However, those characters provided the much needed comic relief, as well as the humanity back in our allied army. \n\"...\"Kruppe denies the existence of elusive complexity regarding self, worrisome wizard. Simplicity is Kruppe\u2019s mistress \u2013 in joyful conspiracy with his dear wife, Truth, of course. Long and loyal in allegiance, this happy threesome\u201d...\"\nWe also get to learn a ton of background on some of the races and G-ds, while creating a much bigger and better picture of the world as a whole. We get a better understanding of the powers involved, although I am sure this is only the tip of the iceberg, and how they got to be the way they are. The Deck of Cards is also being established as much more than just a tool for fortune-telling or a game and one of our heroes is taking a prominent spot in its hierarchy. Silverfox and her T'lan Imass had an interesting plot-line and their relationship with the Barghast, Moranth, as well as the way they experience life after thousands of years of existence, is absolutely fascinating!!! Tool was wonderful as always, and i think some more earthly pleasures are going to be in his near future:):):) \n\"...\"They were human once, these women. They lived in villages and towns no different from this one. They were wives and mothers, tending their homes and yard animals. They danced, and they wept, they were pious and respectful in propitiating the old gods. They lived normal lives.\u201d...\"\nIf I compare how this book differs from the one before it, I have to say it is in the attempt at having moments of light banter and glimpses of hope and humanity. In \"Deadhouse Gates\" we were battered by devastation, pain, helplessness, hopelessness, complete demoralization and strangulating depression which comes with the reality and cruel indifference of war. It was gut-wrenching, soul-stripping and left me with the feeling of hopeless bleak raw pain. While there we were shown the atrocities of war, here we see how in the name of faith and hope for any sort of salvation, we are capable of striping ourselves of our humanity, inflicting war on ourselves and once that is exhausted, on the rest of the world. The hungry, barely armed host of the Pannion Domin, throwing themselves as a mass on the well-trained and armed soldiers like devouring army ants, trying to eat their enemies in the midst of the battle, insane with huger and abuse, stripped to their most base instincts, will be for EVER tattooed on my mind as an example of complete dehumanization!!! However, we still get the other side of the coin in our very human Bridgeburners, Reeve, Barghast and other incidental characters, which keep the candle of hope and faith in humanity alive. This hope is what makes \"Memories of Ice\" an easier book to read and probably why, even with the tremendous losses we suffer among our favorite characters, many fans of the series have it as one of their favorite books. I personally had a much more visceral reaction to the DG, but I totally appreciated the change of mood, such as it is, in MoI. I actually laughed out loud during some of the conversation with Kruppe or the previously mentioned lady warriors and loved every second of it!!! \n\"...\u201cWar is not a natural state. It is an imposition, and a damned unhealthy one. With its rules, we willingly yield our humanity.\u201d...\"\nSo, if you love Epic Fantasy, or any military genres, and have some tolerance for heavier content with difficult at times imagery, but full of action and multitude of well-thought out plot-lines, as well as very memorable and compelling characters, this series is for you!!! It is not easy-going and there are no rainbows and fluffy clouds or coy romance, but there is a lot of substance and wonderful pay-off! It is not a perfect book, but it is oooo, so worth it:) I wish you all Happy Reading and may you find what you NEED between the pages of a good BOOK!!!"}, {"userName": "Conor", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30552336-conor", "userReview": "[ the last stand of the Mortal sword and Itkovian\u2019s sacrifice at the end...

It is the reason why I even read grimdark in the first place, given that I am so easily assailed by emotions that one wonders why I willingly put myself through such heartbreak. So bear with me throughout this series when I keep waxing lyrical about how humanity manifests its most amazing attributes in the face of relentless hardship and horrors of a world ravaged by conflict. As Deadhouse Gates dealt with the rise of the Seven Cities rebellion, the Memories of Ice was of the events that happened concurrently back on Genabackis as Dujek Onearm's Host with Whiskeyjack and Captain Paran with his Bridgeburners turned towards the threat of the Pannion Domin, a rising empire sweeping up from the southern reaches of the continent. Where two previously opposing armies now turned allies - the renegade Malazans and the mercenary armies of Caladan Brood, who was backed by the ever mysterious Tiste Andii and their lord, Anomander Rake; a gathering of possibly the world's most powerful and dangerous.Being a trained archaeologist and anthropologist, Erikson's capacity for worldbuilding with deep and complex history was showcased in full glory. The book opened with a Prologue of events which took place aeons ago. To be exact, part I of the Prologue was dated almost three hundred thousand years before humans walked on this world. These pivotal events had culminated in the seemingly many-faced war that afflicts the current world. Ancient wrongs that led to broken and powerful beings that now feed on the poison of vengeance. And after a hundred thousand years, an ancient god had finally awakened to face the rising threat of the Crippled God that may devour all of mankind and ascendants alike. The Deck of Dragons was also much more than what it seemed, and with a portentous change caused by some strange convergence of powers and events, an unwitting and reluctant mortal had been chosen to play a crucial role in this game of gods and ascendants. A Malazan book usually takes me twice as long to read as compared to another fantasy of similar length. This one, in particular, was really dense with so much to take in; from all the foreshadowing to the revelations, to the amazing battle scenes, and the empathetic development of a vast cast of characters. However, Erikson's writing and narrative skills seem to be improving as we move from one book to the other and in spite of the density of the overarching plot, Memories of Ice was easier to appreciate than its predecessors. While there were more new characters being introduced yet again, we have familiar and favourite faces from Gardens of the Moon which made the connection to the story significantly smoother. The characters, both new and old, were absolutely compelling in the portrayal of humanity at its best. Within the Pannion Domin led by the Seer, was manifested in stark brutality, the ugly side of humanity when faced with an all-consuming need, one which was the most primal of all. The first big battle evinced the fragility of mortality but in direct contrast, we also see the sheer resiliency of mere mortals sworn to protect their own. And those who were singular in their courage driven by grief and loss from the mindless deaths that accompanied such savagery. The Siege of CapustanAmidst this bloody campaign against the Pannion Seer, the storylines of a few notable characters were the most captivating. Firstly, that of unlikely new friendships forged between mortals and almost immortals. One of which was a bond forged through the burdens and unspoken grief that both had lived through, no matter the disparity of its length in which it was borne; the other by a shared path and unexpected compassion. \n\n\"With the proper perspective, even a mortal life can seem long. Fulfilling. What I contemplate at the moment is the nature of happenstance. Men and women, who for a time, find themselves walking in step, on parallel paths. Whose lifes brush close, howsoever briefly, and are so changed by the chance contact.\"\n\nFrom such a chance contact, also rose an improbable but beautiful love story within the newly allied armies. The improbability was not so much because of the different camps from which the two lovers sprung from, but because of the different lifespan and nature of their respective people. A love between a human and a long-lived being who has lived through so many years of despair that her race was given to apathy for over a millennium. \n\nA heart, once of stone, made mortal once more.\n\nMortals, which can bring gods and godlike beings to their very knees. The story of Itkovian, the Shield Anvil of Fener, was one which brought me to mine as it did for tens of thousands with his boundless and unfathomable capacity for compassion. To make right yet another ancient wrong. \n\nI am the Shield Anvil. I am Fener's grief. I am the world's grief. And I will hold. I will hold it all, for we are not yet done.\n\n Well, I am just about done as to continue regaling about all the grim yet touching and inspiring storylines in this book will just be too much for a review. Suffice to say that even with the stupendous tale of the Chain of Dogs in Deadhouse Gates, Erikson successfully followed through with another superior instalment to the Malazan Book of the Fallen. The ending sequence in Memories of Ice was epic, relentless, emotionally powerful and tragic. Even though this was a reread, I was not insensate to the heartbreaks that Erikson seemed to love subjecting his readers to. \n\nSoldiers are issued armour for their flesh and bones, but they must fashion their own for their souls. Piece by piece.\n\n Just as readers of the Malazan Book of the Fallen need to fashion armour for their hearts. Preferably in adamantium or vibranium. (Oh sorry, wrong series/genre.)

But there is so much that happens in this book that it is really hard to sum it up in a review. However this is what I\u2019ve now learned from Steven Erickson in this series:\u2776 - My favorite Character will die. Seriously 3 books and in each one the character I liked the most ended up dead. Whether they die a true death OR simply ascend to something else is yet to be seen.\u2777- Someone will backstab someone else at a most inopportune time and get a lot of people killed. You would think that would go with #1 but it is its own thing.\u2778 - Someone from the past will show up with a completely different name and you will have to try to figure out who they are.  Sometimes it is easy and other times you really have to work for it.\u2779 - A character that you used to like will probably do something that turns you against them or at least makes you question why you ever liked them.\u277a - Someone will make a sacrifice that is devastating. \u277b - The one relationship that you root for in the book will be torn apart or never really get any tractionThere are many other things I\u2019ve learned but those are the main bits.Dujek, Whiskeyjack and the Bridgeburners were always one of my favorites from Gardens of the Moon and so I was happy to be with them again. I will say that there are some crazy things going on in this book like women from the Pannion Domin raping men who are dying on the battlefield because it is supposed to make a child born from that a seer. Alomander Rake is back with Moonspawn and that cursed blade. I loved that we get some history on how that blade was forged and that Alomander Rake was not the first to wield it.Paran actually has a really interesting arc going on and some unexpected changes in him. While I don\u2019t get everything that his new \u2018position\u2019 entails I think it means that he will be a big player at the end. I was really excited for him to be reunited with Tattersail in the form of SIlverfox but alas that actually ended up being one of my least favorite parts of the story\u2026.again see #6.Best new character award goes to Gruntle. I love that guy (that means he is doomed in the future > eyes #1 suspiciously ). I wasn\u2019t really sure what to think of him at the beginning but his story actually ended up being my favorite for this book. I love that he doesn\u2019t care for the houses or the gods in them one bit and yet now he is attached to one. He probably isn\u2019t what that god wanted but he was in the right place at the wrong time and as the strips are with him forever now. Of course he was the person that I really was hoping would get a good relationship going with Stoney but alas again I was thwarted by #6. I love them together though.The end to this was chalked full of action and it was so sad. I am really heartbroken that things played out as they did. I\u2019m still not sure how I feel, accept I feel like I lost a good friend at the end of this. It is sometimes hard to believe that some of the characters in this book are not real people. There were deaths in the other books I was upset by but there is one in this that totally gutted me and we are only at book 3 so I\u2019m not sure my tender notions are going to survive this series.But on to House of Chains and the new heartache that is sure to come with it."}, {"userName": "edge of bubble", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55519430-edge-of-bubble", "userReview": "[ but getting to know him better made everything more hurtful! again fuck you, tree-humping tosser aka Erikson! my heart broke for Korlat!but that blessing!!!

Enter an alliance so fabulous it would make the casting list of The Expendables look like a bunch of second-rate actors. On one hand, you have the Malazan Army, led by High Fist Dujek One-Arm and the legendary Whiskeyjack, including among others the fabled Bridgeburners.

Together, they march to crush an empire.\"I have an idea, a wonderful idea \u2014 as are all my ideas, of course. Wonderful, that is.\"In addition to the recurring characters, a lot of new and interesting ones join the fray. My favourite part of this book, and rising to become one of my favourite Malazan characters, is Lady Envy, the powerful daughter of the mythic god Draconus. It\u2019s no secret that I have a soft spot for ruthless, manipulative sorceresses in fantasy, especially when you can add a lovely sense of sarcasm on top of that, and this woman definitely fits the bill.Additionally, it was very interesting to get several big revelations concerning the magic and the gods of this world. Most important of all, the rise of the Crippled God and his House of Chains. This book actually gave the first hints of a coherent, overarching story, and also of a main antagonist for the series.\"Midnight comes often in the dusk of my life, when I look back upon all that I have survived. The deaths of so many for whom I cared and loved in my heart, have expunged all sense of glory from my thoughts. To have escaped those random fates has lost all triumph.\"Above all, this is the book where the apprentice proves how much he has learnt from the master. It is no secret that Steven Erikson\u2019s main inspiration is Glen Cook and his Chronicles of the Black Company, but it\u2019s not always immediately visible. In this book however, I felt that Erikson took a few long strides closer to Cook. Both in writing style (if I read the above passage out of context, I would have guessed Cook without a second thought), in characterisation, and in the overall feel of the setting and the storyline.Everyone who has read this series seems to think that this is one of the, if not the, best book. I\u2019ll unfortunately have to disagree. While I really enjoyed it, I thought it was pretty much the same level as both Gardens of the Moon and Deadhouse Gates. And like I said: Glen Cook syndrome. Just like when I read the Black Company books, I find that the series as a whole is worthy of five stars, but that the individual books are not.It also suffers a bit from the ending to Deadhouse Gates being virtually impossible to top in my eyes. That is not only my favourite part of the Malazan series so far, but one of the best endings to a fantasy book I have ever read. I should also mention that I read this book while having a dreadful hay fever and great troubles concentrating, so I could probably have liked this even more if I read it at a more optimal time.But in the end, I definitely enjoyed reading this. And I am certainly looking forward to reading more.Aye, this day ends in ashes and rain.

This tide will spread. It will infect every city, on every continent, it will devour empires and nations from within.'In Memories of Ice we are returned back to the continent of Genabackis. Erikson's decision to flip back and forth between books wasn't apparent to me at first, but I was happy to be back with some familiar characters from GotM. After reading the prologue I knew this was going to be something different than the first two books. It just had that feel that this is where this tale REALLY begins.There is a lot of historical information revealed which really helped the stories progression, and helped me understand some things in the two previous books I wasn't sure of. Erikson did a great job of bringing all this together with enough detail to help the reader along. I really thought it was cool how he tied in events from Deadhouse Gates, but that is all I will say as to avoid any spoilers. Most of the characters in Memories of Ice I was already familiar with from GotM, but there were new faces thrown into the mix for this book as well. The multiple story arcs were superbly done, and I found myself invested in all of them. Were as most books with multiple POV's I would only be interested in one or two. My favorites for this book were Toc the Younger, Whiskeyjack, and Paran, but above all it had to be Itkovian the Shield Anvil of Fener.'He is the Shield Anvil. Fener knows grief, so much grief that is beyond his capacity to withstand it. And so he chooses a human heart. Armoured. A mortal soul, to assume the sorrow of the world. The Shield Anvil.'The story itself is truly epic in scale. The history of this world; its races, gods and elder gods, events from hundreds of thousands of years ago that are haunting this worlds present state and people. But what stood out to me the most were the interactions of these characters with each other. The friendships that were formed and how those relationships effected events, was one of the best elements of this book to me. 'Compassion is priceless in the truest sense of the word. It must be given freely. In abundance.'While I loved the first two books in this series they are a little below this one by my standards. Still great, but Memories of Ice is in a league of its own. Erikson just keeps raising the bar. His writing can be both brutal and poetic at the same time. An amazing feat by any author, and he makes it seem so easy how he does it page after page. 'Like these memories of ice, raining, raining down upon us. Freed...to feed the earth - deliverance, of meaning, of emotion, history's gift - the land underfoot, the layers, so many layers -To feed the earth.'I hope all of you,at some point, get a chance to read this series.

We follow their precarious alliance as they march into war against an empire known as the Pannion Domin. As we follow them, we also meet a lot of new characters because Erikson likes to throw more players in the mix and spice things up. At first, I was overwhelmed with so many new additions but as story flowed, and with a little help from Tor's Malazan re-read, I managed to get a hold of things and very much enjoyed the rest of the ride.\"\nMemory's so treacherous. One moment you're lost in a carnival of delights, with poignant childhood aromas, the flashing neon of puberty, all that sentimental candy-floss... the next, it leads you somewhere you don't want to go.

So, back to that quote. Memories are a big theme in this book and a lot of characters actions are driven by them, for better and for worse. When you dig deep beyond the main plot you realize that this is something more than just a war story, this is a convergence of actions from thousands of years ago and memories and consequences of those actions are shaping the world today.There is one character who reminded me the most of that quote and that is the leader of the Pannion Domin but again, I can't explain more without spoiling the book for you but I hope that those of you who have read it will get what I was trying to say. *fingers crossed*When I was done with the Deadhouse Gates I found it to be the most brutal and soul crushing book I've ever read and this one comes as a close second. There are a lot of tragedies hitting our beloved characters and this may sound a bit morbid but there is some poetic beauty in those tragedies that makes this series what it is. Don't worry, this book isn't depressing as my review so far made it to be and I'm sorry if you got that impression. Yes, there are tragedies and horrible deaths (it's a war story, after all) but there are also a plethora of things that will keep you entertained; gripping story, amazing twists, character interaction (especially the Bridgeburners), comic relief moments and the most epic battles you can imagine that would look spectacular on screen. The way Erikson writes those battles will make you feel like you're right in the middle of them, like a Malazan virtual reality but without the headset.  \"\nIf at the end of a war story you feel uplifted, or if you feel that some small bit of rectitude has been salvaged from the larger waste, then you have been made the victim of a very old and terrible lie. There is no rectitude whatsoever. There is no virtue. As a first rule of thumb, therefore, you can tell a true war story by its absolute and uncompromising allegiance to obscenity and evil.\n\" \u2013 Tim O'BrienThis story won't make you feel uplifted but it will touch you and leave an unforgettable impression on you that will make you cherish the whole experience and that is the beauty of Malazan."}, {"userName": "Deborah Obida", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54790180-deborah-obida", "userReview": "Diversity is worth celebrating, Humbrall Taur, for it is the birthplace of wisdom.\nOne of my friends on GR who has read this books said, Memories of Ice (MoI) makes Deadhouse Gates(DG) looks like Gardens of the moon(GoTM) and I could not agree more. The predeccessors of this book were great but this surpassed all my expectations. The plot is Aamazing, lots of revelations, answers to questions from the first two books, we finally get to know about the origin of Dragnipur, the elder gods, what made the T\u2019lan Imass the way they are, more about jaghut etc. And since its Malazan book of the fallen, we have an unaccountable number of battles, whose depictions will leave you slacked jawed. The gods and ascedents interferred here more than they did in the previous books, don\u2019t even get me started on the magic system, I love it so much, I love and hate it when people don\u2019t just remain dead, like how am I suppose to know who is dead for real, but love it when my favs comes back from the dead, I lost some favs here but am glad one got reborn or rebirth, whatever the right word is.Before I forget there is also romance in these, not the smoochy kind but the kind worthy of fantasy. Also the Quick Ben and Kalam\u2019s backstory, even how Fiddler got his name.The incidents in this book took place at the sametime with Deadhouse Gates.Worldbuilding and WritingI love this world so much, Steven Erickson outdid himself, the depiction is what I love more about it, what\u2019s a good world without perfect depiction, crap. But this world is perfect, the representation of differnt cultures, races and the like. The book is written the same as its predeccessors, third person multiple POV, this book has more than 20 POVs, I stopped counting at 15 but I know they were more.CharactersThe new ones are as amiable as the old ones, except for one that I loathe with passion. If you are familiar with this series you need not be told that this series has an unusual number of characters, this is book 3 and I still don\u2019t know who the main characters are, I\u2019ve counted more than 10 main characters so far, here are my favourites in this book.The new characters are Gruntle, Stonny Menackis, Itkovian,Lady Envy, Pannion, Hetan, Cafel, Anaster and a host of othersGruntle and Stonny are my favs among the new characters, they have known each other all their lives, they work together as Caravan guards with a friend of theirs Harllo, Gruntle is careful and cynical while Stonny is the exact opposite, and its the two of them that\u2019s on the cover of one of the editions. These two are so hilarious, they argue like married couples.\nWhat say you, Stonny? Would the iron petals of your heart unfold for me?'She sneered. 'Everyone knows that two-handed sword of yours is nothing but a pathetic attempt at compensation, Harllo.''He's a nice turn at the poetic, though,' Gruntle pointed out. 'Iron petals \u2013 you couldn't get more precise than that.''There's no such thing as iron petals,' Stonny snorted. 'You don't get iron flowers. And hearts aren't flowers, they're big red, messy things in your chest. What's poetic about not making sense? You're as big an idiot as Buke and Harllo, Gruntle. I'm surrounded by thick-skulled witless fools.''It's your lot in life, alas,' Gruntle said.\nItkovian is a shield avil to Fener, the god of war, the Fener that Heboric was once a priest to, he is such an honoorable man and I love his POV so much.The Malazans which include Onearm\u2019s host, Dujek himself, Whiskeyjack, Ganoes Paran,Quick Ben, Picker, Blend and the rest of the BridgeburnersGanoes Paran my baby, am so loving his character development, he is no longer the naive noble from GoTM, he has grown into his role as Captain despite what happened in GoTM, and get ready for more from him in these.Whiskeyjack is once again a commander, he is ever so honorable and he made great friends here that I want for myself, he always tend to make the right decisions at the right time.The Bridgeburners are the best squad, their conversations are out of these world.\nThe dark-eyed woman at her side frowned. 'Want me to hunt Antsy down?''Why bother? Hear those grunts? That's our sergeant taking that Barahn maiden for a ride. He'll be back in a moment or two, looking pleased\u2014''And the lass trailing a step behind\u2014''With a confused look on her face\u2014''\"That's it?\"''She blinked and missed it.'They shared a short, nasty laugh.\nAnd this is them going into battle\n'Aye, Captain. So, who do you figure will die first, you or us?''That's too close to call.'She grinned. 'Half my back pay, Captain, we'll be a step behind you. Pay up at Hood's Gate.''You're on, Lieutenant.\nCaladan Brood\u2019s host which consist of the Tiste Andii, Rhivi, Mercenaries and the likeAnonmander Rake is back and he is more badass than ever! Am beginning to think that no one actually knows him, this book offers more indepth on him and he is way better than people give him credit for, wish there was more of him in this book, I just can\u2019t get enough of him.I love this conversation, Lady Envy is the first person apart from Caladan Brood that talks to Anomander this way.\nLady Envy had seen them. 'Lieutenant dear! What a relief to see you well. Could you believe the audacity of that white-haired, sword-stuffed\u2014''Would you be referring to me?' a deep voice asked.Through the gloom stepped Anomander Rake. 'Had I known you were within the keep, Lady Envy, I would have brought Moon's Spawn all the way down.''Oh, what a thing to say!''What are you doing here?' the Son of Darkness growled.'Oh, this and that, my love. And aren't you looking very martial this afternoon \u2013 it's still afternoon, isn't it? Hard to tell here.'\nSilverfox another mysterious woman, she annoyed me a bit, not enough to wish her harm though, but I later found her reason for the decision and it was honourable but it won\u2019t have killed her to confide in someone.PlotAfter the incident at Darujhistan, with Onearm\u2019s host outlawed they need allies to fight and defeat The Pannion Domin, an Empire that thrive on choas and cannibalism, there is more about the Pannion Domin which I won\u2019t mention cause of spoilers. So they got themselves allies from all angles of the continent, some of the allies will blow your mind. If you think the Pannion Empire is all they have to defeat think again, an ancient god that is hated by the other gods is causing problems, so that means they have gods intertwined in mortal lives once again, and this is happening at the same time as the Raruku rebellion."}, {"userName": "Kaora", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7983564-kaora", "userReview": "Memories are woven tapestries hiding hard walls-tell me my friends, what hue your favored thread, and I in turn, will tell the cast of your soul.So far this is my favorite book in the series. I struggled with a large part of Gardens of the Moon as Erikson throws readers in to the massive world he has created, and it is sink or swim. In Deadhouse Gates, there are a few familiar faces from Gardens of the Moon but the majority are new, and I found it a bit dragging in parts. However with Memories of Ice I felt like I had a pretty good handle on the world he created, allowing me to enjoy the little things.Like his amazing writing, with unique characters and great dialogue. I do appreciate an author that can so subtly veil jokes that if you read too quickly you may miss a hidden gem.Which pretty much sums up this entire book. It is a ton of work. There are many different plot lines and characters, that somehow all intertwine neatly producing a hell of a story. But only if you pay attention.Erikson is master of the subtle. He won't tell you outright the identity of some of the characters or gods encountered in the travels of other characters, but instead produce hints in the way they walk, or an event in their history they talk about. It can be aggravating at times, but the payoff is well worth it as you will discover in these pages amazing characters, epic battles, incredible magic and dark villains.Cross posted at Kaora's Corner."}, {"userName": "Kevin Xu", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2310290-kevin-xu", "userReview": "This is one of the most EPIC book I have ever read.

This is simply the greatest series ever. Original review:I didn't think there could be a more heart wrenching ending than Deadhouse Gates but this was much worse.

Only memories of ice.\u201d\n\nA true masterpiece of the genre.\nIf \nGardens of the Moon\n (however ambitious) was a sloppy introduction with narrative obstructions that prevented shiny and glossy entry into the series, then duo of \nDeadhouse Gates\n with its emotional wrestling and \nMemories of Ice\n with its flawless execution, were determined in their goal to win you over for eternity.In my opinion, this is Erikson\u2019s best book. And the words I would use to describe it are: perfectly balanced.Sufficiently developed newly introduced characters, engulfed with spry sense of humor - something that will from now on stand as Erikson\u2019s strongest trademark and the main reason why are we falling in love with these characters in the first place (beside their bottomless depth, of course); deep and compelling story, that, while a continuation of the first book, also successfully juggles the parallel story of the second one - all while further progresses in building the world, without actually overwhelming the reader.On the contrary. While it may seem as too long while reading it, by the end of this book, it will compel you wishing for more pages for you to explore.\n\nStory.\n\n\n\u201cForces of nature are indifferent to justice. Thus it fails to us sentient beings, no matter how unworthy, to impose the moral divide.\u201d\n\n\nLink to enlargeLink to enlargeWe\u2019re back on the continent of \nGenabackis,\n land which parts everyone are opportunistically claiming, be that under the banners of conquest or liberation. And as often in real life, as two sides are battling, third one emerges conquering everything before them, unopposed. Atrocities they commit are so vast that two opposing sides now have to join in order to stop them.Although it helps that \nHigh Fist Dujek Onearm,\n leader of \nMalazan\n invading army, is now turned renegade by \nEmpress Laseen,\n which seemingly should help forming a pact with his former foes, \nCaladan Brood\n and \nAnomander Rake.\n Ha!On their opposing side, far in the south in the land of \nPanion Domin,\n priest turned king - \nPanion Seer\n rises armies, armies which includes the \nTenescowri,\n a peasant horde, driven by famine, who in their cannibalistic tendencies, leave nothing and no-one to spare.Two sides will meet on the plains before the city of \nCapustan,\n but not before the Tenescowri try to \u2018resupply\u2019 in the city itself. Hence the long siege of Capustan - a thrilling battle of survival - begins.I\u2019ll have to say that, for me, the siege of Capustan, with hundreds of thousands of psychotically murderous cannibals turned warriors - who assail city gates - and just a handful thousands of \nGrey Sword\n mercenaries and brave few citizens - who defend it - is most staggering battle sequence, not just of the book or the series, but in the genre as a whole.Because this isn\u2019t just a battle of people and of their swords on swords and flesh on flesh \u2013 this isn\u2019t a battle of violence by its design.This is a battle of humanity. Preserving one. The battle when everything is lost; when your body reacts mechanically and by its memory; when fog of war threatens to blind you to commit same amount of atrocities in the name of perverse justice (or in this case vengeance) \u2013 to show a compassion.And most importantly: the battle in you, to find it.But above everything else, this book is about motherhood.Oh yes. Here comes a paragraph or two about \nMhybe.\nInterestingly enough, same like with \nFelisin\u2019s\n story of her bravery in \nDeadhouse Gates,\n book which preceded this one, in all my previous reads, I would never properly focus on a story of Mhybe\u2019s motherhood. I mean, there are battles and conflicts larger than life, characters that veer into dragons, amazing crew of soldiers you want to hang out with and witty wizards you secretly want to become yourself. So, of course, whenever story derails from that cast of characters, I would protest internally.But, maybe, there comes a time when your approach to the same book you have read so many times before slightly changes. You grow as a reader, and along these lines, you are driven by something else; you seek, from that same book, something different.And this is why I think highly and appreciate this series so much. Five, four and three years ago when I was reading this book first, second and third time, I wasn\u2019t even aware that a story about motherhood can be this interesting and this prominent among all these other amazing stories. And the reason that I keep this series so high above everything else in this genre, is that I can come back to it, and after so many reads, still find something that will make this fourth reading experience as new and as emotional as first one.But, I have to say that this isn\u2019t the first time that I noticed the significance of Mhybe in this series. I had a happy childhood and I\u2019m coming from a happy family. I was fortunate enough to be surrounded by a motherly love, and in my close vicinity, all of my friends had a similar experience.So, having a mother who has a love in abundance and was willing to sacrifice herself for her child was a standard. A normal thing. Something that makes you human. Anything less than that was abnormal to me.Right?And then came Mhybe. A character through which I realized that this series goes way deeper than dragons, awesome battles and glorifying deaths. That this series explores parts of human nature we\u2019re not accustomed to, not just exploring, but maybe even understanding.There was a beautiful young girl, full of life, beloved in her tribe, a girl soon to become a woman, eagerly preparing to marry one of many of her suitors.But then, she was chosen to become a vessel; a vessel which through magic would be impregnated with none other than two shattered souls, one beyond death and other held back from it through ancient sorceries, two identities braided together \u2013 a vessel that would be used to feed the unnatural child thus created.So, among her \nRhivi\n tribe, a vessel that would be used as a container for this singular purpose \u2013 after which it would be discarded \u2013 is called Mhybe.She birthed a child, with no father, a child that came from her womb, but had none of her personality, none of her resemblance, a child she could not call her own.A magical child that, through sorcery, grew too fast, sorcery that demanded power, power found nowhere else than in the strength of the woman who gave this child a life, a life given for a life taken.Taken, but so, so slowly, and through such pain.You see, as this child so unnaturally grew older, so did unnaturally grew her mother.And soon, in a matter of months, as she witnessed her child becoming a 10, then a 15, then a 30 year old, Mhybe exponentially grew older; and she became a young woman trapped in a body of an old person, feeling all the aches of an old age. A girl weathered without the gift of years \u2013 old without the wisdom.So, knowing all this, and driven by my own experience I have already mentioned \u2013 fully expecting that whatever the case in this story, mother is there to love and support and care and even sacrifice herself for her child \u2013 it came as nothing but a complete shock when I read Mhybe saying this:\n\u201cShe has stolen my life!I am naught but bones and leather skin, I am naught but endless aches. Dried brittle \u2013 each moment of this terrible existence, and I edge closer to\u2026 to\u2026She has stolen my life\u2026\u201d\nAnd it shocked me even more that I actually understood her. This mother that resents \u2013 no, this mother that actually hates her own child; this abnormal thing for me growing up, given how I was raised and how I viewed the world. I understood her. The fact that Erikson managed to do so, through a character in his book, was enough of a proof how this is on entirely different level than the rest of authors in this genre.And to this day, with all the flaws in this series, and all the love some of the far more lovable series in this genre get, I\u2019m unable to find anywhere else repeating of this exact same thing; wakening of emotions - or at least rising awareness - I didn't know I could have while reading a book. \n\nWorldbuilding, History and Lore.\n\nAs mentioned in reviews for previous books, Gods have an active role in shaping various outcomes.They like to meddle, to pry; they are, as humans tend to be, prone to squabbles, insecurities and vengeance. And not necessarily because there\u2019s abundance of boredom in their Pantheon, no. Most of them are simply vile and vicious creatures. But, since they are all part of Pantheon, there are rules everyone has to abide to. (Or at least everyone who hasn\u2019t found a way to cheat those rules.)\nThe Deck of Dragons.\nDeck of Dragons is essentially an accurate representation of Pantheon. A kind of structure, imposed on power itself and more importantly, imposition of order. Each card is a gate into a \nWarren.\nBefore Warrens (realm and source of magic in this world), before magic was refined in elemental \nPaths\n which could be manipulated in current state through those Warrens, there were \nHouses.\n (And even before them there were Holds. And even before that \u2013 Wandering through Chaos.)And structure of those Houses is something like this:High House represents God\u2019s little realm. And there are multiple High Houses. \nHigh House of Life\n and \nHigh House of Death. High House of Dark\n and \nHigh House of Light\n etc.In those houses structure has its own order. So every House has their rulers, \nKings\n and \nQueens.\nThey have their loyal subjects such as \nKnights, Heralds, Priests, Masons, Virgins,\n etc.Each has their own role in the house and each has their own card in Deck of Dragons. One way to make sure Gods and their loyal subjects behave in borders of their malice or vanity is through Deck of Cards, or through \nMaster of the Deck,\n who can basically make his own rules, who can grant or decline permission to a House\u2019s existence. \n\u201cPlayers in the game, wanting no others. Players outside the game and wanting in.Players to the forefront and ones behind, moving in the shadows.Players who play fair, players who cheat.\u201d\nIn this book we are finally introduced to \nThe Fallen One, The Crippled God.\n His story is that he\u2019s an alien entity, brought down to the Malazan earth to be shackled. Reasons for that, so far are unknown. We\u2019ll have to trust Gods who are saying that at some point he presented a threat to the world. Yes, those same vicious and vile Gods, yes. I know.So, cyclically, when one Pantheon ceases to exist and a new one arises, they chain him again and again, leaving him in his broken and crippled form.Now, you may ask: \u201cWell, since he\u2019s a God, why isn\u2019t he in a Pantheon with the rest of them?\u201dGood question.It\u2019s a demanding book. And if by chance, by each passing book, it becomes less demanding \u2013 it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean that Erikson lost an edge or that he\u2019s trying to make it easier for you.No. It would probably mean that you\u2019re becoming more demanding reader.

Again, the density of world building combined with the layers of mystery and foreshadowing are just mind boggling and difficult to appreciate the first time round, but are a wonder to unpack on subsequent reads.This third book of the series takes us back to the continent on Genabackis where we are reunited with the Bridgeburners as we pick up the story from book one. The events in this book occur concurrently with the second book and Erikson takes time every now and then to let us know where we are timewise in relation to the events in the second book. For example, we see where The Trygalle Trade Guild is sent off to resupply Fiddler and Coltaine, or we have a character receive a vision of a scene that we recognise from the second book.Returning this book are The Bridgeburners, WhiskeyJack, Paran Ganoes, Quick Ben, Dujek and OneArm\u2019s host, Anomander Rake and the Tiste Andii, Caladan Brood, Silverfox, Onos Toolan and more.

Undead hordes will be summoned. Gods will die and new ones ascend. The pantheon will divide against itself. Mortals will be seduced into choosing sides.

And when its all done and finished, when your sole reason for being has been war, what is left when all you have hated is gone? Only dust and Memories of Ice.But the Bridgeburners have little use for all these high and mighty themes and personalities. Their motto is \u201cFirst in, last out\u201d and they don\u2019t do it for gods or kings or any other assholes out there.

Firstly, this is so seriously jam packed with info and reveals from the first book that I found myself having to scan GotM quite frequently. This book is the first one I felt truly lost in at so many points, but that didn't take away from any of the enjoyment, either. Erikson packs soooooo much into these books that it's quite impressive. There's violence, humour, conspiracies, betrayal and some deaths of a few major players. No one is safe in this world. Characters- we see the return of most of our favorites from GotM! And some new faces that were mentioned before, but we finally get to know them. Caladan Brood being my favorite new character. That freaking hammer!!!! I think he could make Thor cry ;) The character development in this one is spectacular, as well. I think Silverfox, later in the novel, is probably the only character I didn't like. Besides Kallor, of course. BLOODY KALLOR!! But that's all I can say on that, because spoilers lol. World building is also where Erikson shines. Let's be honest, where doesn't the man shine? This one definitely had so much more comic relief, but still prepare them heartstrings ladies and gentlemen, because he pretty much tips them from your chest haha. But seriously, he tips them from your chest. Now I just have to wait for House of Chains to get here. And it can't get here fast enough!Ps- sorry for any typos, currently writing this via my phone lol"}, {"userName": "Bradley", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4213258-bradley", "userReview": "I think it's actually this book where I'm finally getting into the swing of things better, but perhaps that's just familiarity with the endless procession of characters. It helped when I finally broke down and got the help of a wiki. :)On the other hand, I sure as hell never needed help loving Kruppe even from the first book and that sure as hell hasn't changed by the third. What a personality!And of course there's a lot to love about Brood and Rake, both in story, history, and personal quirks, but Silverfox really does rather steal the show for me.What I'm really most fascinated about are the gods. It's hard not to see them all as stealing the show from the normal folk, because, truly, we're surrounded by them in the story, whether they're the elder gods or the new gods, the tragic T'lan Imass, or the new NEW gods, they're all flashy and full of flavor in comparison to the poor mortals, alas. Or at least, they would be if they didn't keep getting taken down a notch or three and proving that certain mortals have a talent of surviving.Or not. *sigh* No spoilers.Honestly, I'm still enthralled by the Crippled God and all the discussions related to him. The poisoning of the warrens is damn interesting, too. :) I'm surrounded by big, big ideas and the scope is breathtaking. When we say immortals, we really mean immortals, people. What's a 100k years, anyway? This is nothing different from the first two, of course, but I'm still feeling the effects.I love the little subversions and Silverfox's development and twisty bits, too. I could keep going, after all, this is a really huge novel and so much happens, but suffice to say, nations fall, the fate of so many tortured souls and gods and everyone else is at stake. There's surprisingly less fighting in the text than I expected, filled with a ton of intrigue and people just trying to figure out what's going on, and I was just fine with that. It made for an interesting discovery novel. :)"}, {"userName": "Gavin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8192509-gavin", "userReview": "This was the best Malazan book so far. It was so good that it ranks alongside the best the fantasy genre has to offer. Steven Erikson did a great job of weaving his gigantic cast of characters and complex plot and subplots into a cohesive fast paced and intriguing story. The story picked up from where we left off in Gardens of the Moon. Dujek's host have been outlawed by the Malazan Empire and are in the process of forming an alliance with their old foes, led by Caladan Brood and Anomander Rake, in order to fight a larger and more dangerous threat that is rising in the South. That threat is the fanatical Pannion Domin. As always there is far more going on than just the happenings in the mortal realm. The Crippled God seeks vengeance against a world that has left him crippled and imprisoned. His power is such that the other Gods are forced to put aside their usual petty squabbles and marshal a defense. The story was complex and packed with plenty of action, drama, mystery, and intrigue. I was not bored for a single moment despite this being a massive book! As with all Malazan books this one was pretty dark and had more than its fair share of heartbreaking moments. That said, I think this installment delivered a far better balance than we had in Deadhouse Gates because the darker aspects of the story are balanced with a bit of humor and some uplifting acts of truly inspiring heroism. Another massive improvement on the second book was the cast. As always it was massive, but this time around I was glad to return to the stories of the likable and interesting characters we met in Gardens of the Moon. Favorite characters such as Kruppe, Paran, Quick Ben, Whiskeyjack, Anomander Rake, Toc, and Tool were all back and more awesome than ever. Memories of Ice also benefited from adding a whole host of fantastic new characters, or from simply better developing minor characters from the first book. The pick of the bunch was the Grey Sword Itkovian, but others like Gruntle, Stonny, Lady Envy, Mok, Korlat, Picker, and Blend were almost as good additions. I love the truly epic feel this series has as a result of its large cast of both human and non-human characters, multiple settings, detailed back stories, cool magic system, and intricate plot.This was an outstanding read and I'm eager to press on to the next book!Rating: 5 stars.Audio Note: This is the last book in the Malazan series narrated by the excellent Ralph Lister which is a real shame in my eyes as he has done a great job. His take on Kruppe will definitely be missed."}, {"userName": "*Absorbed in Countless Worlds*", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30465086-absorbed-in-countless-worlds", "userReview": "Simply one of the best books i ever read.

It turns out - Quick Ben does not like the bad guy either and is determined to stop him. The first move of The Chained God is to rouse some fanatics on the south of continent and to send them on conquest of all neighboring cities using the cult's Seer as his pawn. This move is just a distraction, but it must be dealt with quickly to free the players to deal with real problems. Thus former enemies (Dujek and Caladan Brood) make an uneasy alliance.

Since then there have been much weaker installments). This is so because of the following reasons:-The Mhybe storyline: Literally 150 pages of a character whining with nothing important happening. It is perfectly credible that given the Mhybe's situation she would be upset and give into self pity. But why do we need so many pages going over this?-Inane Bridgeburners banter: Pages upon pages of the Bridgeburner characters talking about nothing. Erikson's humour can be very hit or miss, and here its a complete miss that wastes pages before your eyes.-Irrelevant storylines: Although Erikson can nearly always stand his page count lowered, here it is more apparent, specifically in the storyline of Korbal Broach. It has nothing to do with any other characters, nor does it impact the plot in any way, though it can be amusing. I understand that there are novelettes devoted to the character, but here he makes an already overlong book even more so.-Its just too fucking much. The climax at Corel is so completely over the top, even for Erikson. There comes a point when he needs to limit himself. See the climaxes of Deadhouse Gates and Midnight Tides for examples of limits and excellence coinciding.-Kruppe. Anyone who has read the book will know why.-The Crippled God. Namely, this book suffers from being released before Midnight Tides, which acts as a prequel and explains the Crippled God's rise. Here, an entity we have only heard mention of over the first two books becomes the series villain and completely domineering in the space of 20 pages. No build up whatsoever. Thats not to say that there are no positives. The entire section dealing with the siege of Capustan is beautifully written, and is the best account of a siege/military operation you're likely to get in fantasy. Certain characters, like Ganoes Paran and Whiskeyjack, are characterized more coherently than in Gardens of the Moon. In all though, Memories is the worst Malazan book so far, and could be vastly improved by cutting out 200 pages or so."}, {"userName": "ijeoma Agbaje", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16037420-ijeoma-agbaje", "userReview": "\"We are all pushed into a world of madness, yet it must now fall to each of us to pull back from this Abyss, to drag ourselves free of the descending spiral. From horror, grief must be fashioned and from grief, compassion\"-ItkovianTo start with MoI was a wild ride & probably a fairly confusing one at times. This wasn't a story stictly about a particular set of people. This was a book that had a plot with a truck load of sub plots. From the Outlawed Malazan/Brood/Rake/Pannion Seer plot, to the Grey Swords/Capustan seige plot, to Stonny/Gruntle part, to the Crippled god/Elder gods foray, to the death of gods and finding of new ones, and T'Lan I'mass/ Jaghut conflict (phew!! i think i covered everything) it'll be impossible really to coherently write a review on each story so i'm just going to stick with characters that totally threw me (in a good way)The Brideburners - First In Last Out (Motto of the Bridgeburners)From GoTM we are regaled with how exceptional the bridgeburners are especially WhiskeyJack's crew. Unfortunately after the events at Pale, they are more or less a broken bunch. Paran refers to them at a point, as a \"brittle, heart-broken company\". and while you see, the effects of that, lack of cohesion and all that, what i absolutely loved about them was their willingness to stick with each other to the bitter end and lord, when it came down to it at Coral, you could totally see it. Itkovian - ...And i am not yet doneOh this man, this wonderful, weary absolutely wonderful man..Not sure i can write a whole lot about him without spoilers but let me just say that Itkovian was bad ass!!i mean just look at that man.Captain ParanGotta say Paran really stepped up. Dude went from whinny and no i don't want to do it, you can't make me to completely taking charge of the Bridgeburners and what he became. Totally loved the growth and the better confidence he had in himself,how he finally accepted responsibility for the bridgeburners and kicking that debilitating doubt to the curb that was always weighing him down. Always love him for what he said to Lt. Picker here \"The Bridgeburners...Keep them together, no matter what happens. Together Lieutenant\"Honourable Mentions:Korlat, Toc the younger, Tool, Gruntle & Stonny, those segulah (that the spelling?), those two Malazan soldiers that took over guarding silverfox (we never did learn their names),QuickBen, i want to add envy but that woman was like the annoying grown up version of Kruppe. Can never get a straight answer from those two.In reference to the story, i honestly thought meeting the Pannion Seer thing was a bit underwhelming after Capustan especially as you already figure who the Pannion seer is way quite early too, as far as i'm concerned. Also did not enjoy the whole Mhybe woman plot, i mean for crying out loud, why the fuck did she keep running? One minute everything is fine and next thing she just switches off like whoa. Then Silverfox, sigh* it's actually ironic that while the Mhybe was depressed about how Silverfox was her daughter but not really her daughter, Silverfox was basically channeling her mother at the 2nd convergence with the T'lan Imass. You wait fot that long and the first thing you spew is that nonesense? Nah, i was disappointed with her.Also i really really really did not like Hetan. The woman was bloody annoying.Anyhoo, i definitely enjoyed it and i'm totally looking forward to book 4..p:s - i really think the plot of the book was way too divivded for the book to be called memories of ice so yes once again i'm calling it on title of book that really doesn't gel all the way with the plot."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8711587-angela", "userReview": "I found this third book in the series much easier to get into then previous books, as I was already familiar with a lot of the characters. Once again Erikson takes the reader on a rollercoaster ride and you can't help feeling a little sadden as events escalated throughout the story. Whilst this book didn't make me have the hollow pit in my stomach like Deadhouse Gates, it was such a powerful story that leaves me searching for answers and wanting to know what happens next. It's well worth considering following the Ultimate Reading Orderfor this series. I did find it more enjoyable having already read 3 novellas from The Tales of Bauchelain and Korbal Broach series before this book.Malazan is a series that grips you and the sheer scope of the story continues to awe me."}, {"userName": "Jenna Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32846944-jenna-kathleen", "userReview": "[ being eternally trapped in a sword or having three souls possess your body  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Celise", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4653644-celise", "userReview": "[ and later Silverfox as well.

I had known that the world is too complex by far; a web of magic, realms, races, gods, ascendants, and countless other things that Mr. Erikson's imagination has fashioned. Now I can look at the patterns the web makes, the intricacy of the laces woven together by the author, and this is the perfect metaphor for it. Because this isn't a story which flows like a river - in one direction. This is a story which connects and cross-connects, takes you across places, and realms, at once, and gives you glimpses of times past and hints about future. If I may say without exaggeration, it has the weight and epicness of a mythology.That History is an apt teacher who portrays our failures is a thing that I've heard many times, but this was the book where I could really appreciate the implications of this. The tales of Draconus, Nightchill, K'rul, Kallor, Crippled God (all powerful beings) quite evidently show this, the Jaghut wars that the T\u2019lan Imass (two founder races of the world) wage is another example. I am more interested in these tales than I've been ever about real life mythologies (maybe except Greek). I dislike Mr. Erikson for what he has been doing since the past two books. He introduces, sketches, paints, and conjures alive characters so real, so gritty, and then they have to die. I won't even begin to talk about my favourite ones because then this review would become an essay. Fortunately or unfortunately, I have begun expecting a lot from this series, let's see what I make of it."}, {"userName": "Guy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1085095-guy", "userReview": "Tears in my eyes at the end of this one.
