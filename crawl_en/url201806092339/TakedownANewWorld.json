The characters portrayed are strong, well seasoned civilians and military who work well as a team. John provides the reader a glimpse into the thoughts of his characters, their fear, compassion and loyalty without diminishing from the essence of the story.I found myself unable to stop reading, wanting to find out how Jack and the teams solve the problems thrown at them, deal with personal issues, fight off night runners and get home safe to the sanctuary. I agree with the other reviewers - this is by far the best book ... yet!"}, {"userName": "Amanda Davies", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71972171-amanda-davies", "userReview": "I didn\u2019t think I could be more captivated, I mean what the heck???

One hell of a series!!, May 18, 2013 This review is from: A New World: Takedown (Paperback) I just finished this, the 7th book in 'The New world' series. I turned off my Kindle, GOT OUT OF BED AND TURNED ON MY PC so I could write this review. It's 3 in the morning!!! Damn book got me so pumped!! Mr. O'Brien gets you, puts you on a tightrope, the stress is incredible, and just when you think you're finally safe on the ground, the earth opens under your feet. Don't know whether to hit him in the nose or kiss him. (I've seen his picture, so I would have to kiss him)What an incredible man this author is. Read his bio, and then read this series from the beginning. Each book gets better and better. You will love the characters and the survival ideas they come up with. Oh, I forgot to mention the zombies. Lots and lots of zombies.This is not your run-of-the-mill Zombie Apocalypse series either. There is a twist in this story that makes it stand out. If you're curious, you'll have to buy the book. Just buy the first one and soon you'll understand, and you won't have to wait with bated breath for the next one like I did. You'll be able to devour, at least, 7 of them in a row. And yes, so can I by just rereading them, and I have; I'm pretty sure I will again.There is nothing I love more then reading a book good enough to immerse me in its world. So I feel I owe Mr. O'Brien a debt of gratitude for letting me hang out with Jack et al."}, {"userName": "Gregg", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8921898-gregg", "userReview": "If the creatures die from sunlight exposure, why aren't we seeing that used as a weapon? I'd suggest punching holes in walls and roofs, using mirrors or metal reflectors to light a lobby further, perhaps using a prism or disco ball to spread the light through a room. Haven't seen anybody using a generator with ultraviolet lamps to clear out a building. The author has made it clear that Jack believes that sunlight would be torture, but certainly some of the groups he met would have no such compunctions. From the foreword of the next book, I see that the creatures wouldn't be susceptible to commercial UV lights or grow lamps, but none of the characters in the series have even tested UV lighting, so how would they know? As I see it, the creatures are fighting a losing battle. The environment itself will kill them in minutes if their shelter is compromised. Like the classic vampire, this monster has fatal flaws that should prevent it from dominating the world.There a handful of errors that should have been caught by the editor. For instance, a physicist is not the same as a physician. The writing style seems designed for a television miniseries - with lots of descriptions that are meant to be developed into computer generated graphics as done by the CSI series. In my opinion, each book should be able to stand alone as a story, and not end with such an obvious cliffhanger."}, {"userName": "RJ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4187755-rj", "userReview": "Several of the oddities concerning the Night Runners come to a head. The convert staying in the sanctuary falls off the wagon, so to speak. Missing the excitement of the hunt and the taste of blood, takes his nightly stroll in the compound only this time he opens the main gate allowing thousands of Night Runners led by Sandra to overrun sanctuary. According to Sandra's demented plan, including a shock to all the survivors, the Night Runners capture Lynn and retreat back to their lair. They had the survivors by the short hairs and could have wiped them out, but Sandra held to her insane...jealousy? snatching Lynn and calling the Night Runners off. Many of the Night Runners left Sandra in anger, joining with Michael knowing they could have killed all the \"two-legged ones\" feasting in grand style. Michael was none too pleased to say the least, increasing the animosity between Sandra and himself. Jack is off on a two week mission fulfilling a promise to a dozen of his troops in search of family members. The poop will definitely hit the fan when Jack returns! The sub captain has decided to throw in with Jack, has made his way to the rendezvous point, and is waiting for Jack to arrive. Jack returns to sanctuary with another 80 survivors, bringing their total to 330 now, and immediately plans to find and rescue Lynn are made."}, {"userName": "T.W. Brown", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3234548-t-w-brown", "userReview": "How fortunate to have been able to read an advanced copy of this book. I have read the entire series and John O'Brien brings so much to the table that you will want to keep this series around and read it again over time. This book is one that will leave you gasping and wondering just how soon before the next book in the series comes out.O'Brien brings in an element to this genre that adds vast amounts of credibility. Yes, it is an apocalyptic even, but infuse it with some \"Tom Clancy\" styled military flavor and this story goes where so many fear to tread. Yes, the central protagonist has some skills that the average \"Joe\" lacks, but he is not perfect, nor is he infallible. He just happens to have his stuff wired a little tighter than most people.A New World: Takedown is O'Brien's risky expansion into giving his night runners a sense of cognition. While I was hesitant at first out of my odd sense of \"traditionalism\", this story won me over because it was done right by a talented author who has etched his name into a slot of my favorites.No spoilers here. Read it for yourself....then set it down for a few minutes...pick it up and read it again."}, {"userName": "Erika", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16578128-erika", "userReview": "This is the 7th in the New World series and I have read them all. Written by an Air Force veteran, therenis a degree of realism that I really enjoy. Over the last 5 months, I've read a great many dystopian novels. This series is one of my favorites because the characters are very likeable, mostly logical and sincere. The reflection on the response of our military personnel in such circumstances fascinates me. I'm a proud Air Force brat with tremendous admiration and respect for our servicemen and women. Speaking of whom, women are well represented in both number and strength of character in the books.There is only thing that bothers me: the stories could use a bit more editing and proofreading. Verb-subject agreement, spelling errors and missing words irritate me to no end. This is usually a deal breaker for me though the story is compelling enough that I eagerly read on to see what will happen next."}, {"userName": "Rosemary", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17065900-rosemary", "userReview": "What a great way to start a book - from page one you are thrown in the deep end, right in the middle of an intense battle that is taking place. Thousands of night runners had invaded the sanctuary, and hundreds lay dead, but they were there on a mission and nothing would stop them from completing that mission. Once they had what they came for, they left, just like that.That was just the start. From page one right up until the last page, it was non-stop action. Intense, heart stopping action. At one stage in the book I counted four different nail biting encounters happening with various characters all at the same time. I was even tempted at one stage to `skim read' to find out what was happening at another location, but I never did, I just breathed deeply and carried on reading.This was an awesome book. I have probably read well over a thousand books in my life, but this one will always stand out as one of the greats."}, {"userName": "Jett Cat", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18277934-jett-cat", "userReview": "Um, I know this just came out, but when is the next due?

Once I start reading it, I honestly can't stop. It is very well written. Usually by the time a series gets to it's 4th or 5th book, I am ready for it to end.
