No sharp edges. Lots of glare. A nightmare like that, all you want is to forget. None of it ever seemed real in the first place.In The Lake of the Woods holds a special place in my memory. I first read it about sixteen years ago in a stifling un-air-conditioned and over-crowded classroom, and with all my 90s angst I was prime for it to get under my skin. It was the first time that I realized there were books out there that weren\u2019t just about what they were about. After Lake, I sought out different books and expected more of them. Looking back at my age, gender, and disposition, perhaps it should\u2019ve been Esther Greenwood who first spoke to me - that certainly would\u2019ve been a more comforting stereotype. As it were, for better or for worse, it was John Wade.At the funeral he wanted to kill everybody who was crying and everybody who wasn\u2019t. He wanted to take a hammer and crawl into the casket and kill his father for dying\u2026..At school when the teachers told him how sorry they were that he\u2019d lost his father, he understood that lost was just another way of saying dead. But still the idea kept turning in his mind. He\u2019d picture his father stumbling down a dark alley, lost, not dead at all\u2026..He'd bend down and pick up his father and put him in his pocket and be careful never to lose him again.This imagery early in the book sprung out at me when I first read it. The class erupted into snickers, and I giggled along with them. But later, I was left with the vivid picture of an awkward, hurting boy, rustling through blades of grass and scooping up his tiny father. John Wade\u2019s desperate seeking stopped being an amusing image and started to become sad and lonely. After that, all the books I read had to be a little sad and lonely. What O\u2019Brien has created with Lake is a blurry, unfocused story to mimic the blurry, unfocused nature of things \u2013 childhood, marriage, war, life. The narrative skitters around dreamily; everything is given in snippets and suggestions. Everything in John Wade\u2019s life seems as though it\u2019s been filtered through a funhouse mirror. Everything is a distortion. His father was an abusive alcoholic who appeared to everyone else to be a wonderful guy. His mother (like his wife Kathy later on) survives through denial and justification. John performs magic tricks throughout his childhood, controlling and performing. He goes to Vietnam where the events are covered up, half-real, and like everything else, a contorted magic trick for the viewing public. The war, like his father, like his childhood and pretty much everything, is arranged to appear to the world to be something different. After the war, John goes into politics where yet again everything is choreographed to alter reality. Everything is an illusion. Everything we think we know is really just a product of the information we\u2019re given. From our parents, to world events, to this stranger sleeping beside us year after year. How much of what we know to be true actually is true? John Wade spends his life manipulating and covering up. Look around you - he\u2019s not the only one.Our own children, our fathers, our wives and husbands: Do we truly know them? How much is camouflage? How much is guessed at? How many lies get told, and when, and about what? How often do we say, or think, God, I never knew her? How often do we lie awake speculating \u2013 seeking some hidden truth? Oh, yes, it gnaws at me\u2026Denial is a powerful tool that can sustain people for decades. John\u2019s denial, Kathy\u2019s, everybody\u2019s. We tell ourselves it will get better, just hold on, things will work out. What would our lives be like now if we had made just one different decision? How much did we really mean to that one person who will never find the courage to tell us? How much different would things be if we had just spoken up, taken a different job, moved to a different place and reinvented ourselves? If our parents were just a little less tortured, a little more stable? If some men in suits had never signed away our life and innocence? This is not a mystery novel. We\u2019re not supposed to figure out what happened to Kathy, if in fact anything happened to her at all. This is a book of questions, not answers. And the questions you should be asking when you\u2019re done reading is not \u201cdid he kill her?\u201d That\u2019s just the magic trick. At the minimum, you should be asking why we send the mentally ill to war. Why we\u2019re so quick to condemn what we don\u2019t fully comprehend. How reliable are our memories. And, will we ever be free of our demons?Mystery finally claims us."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth George", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42080115-elizabeth-george", "userReview": "I loved this book the first time I read it, and I loved it having just finished it for the second time. I could easily go back to the beginning and read it for a third time right now. This book is not for the faint at heart, nor is it for people who have to have things tied up in bows. It's a book that demonstrates the shattering of a psyche that was fragile to begin with. It's a book about a man who doesn't know himself and thus seeks a definition of self through others and their reactions to him. The vehicle that Tim O'Brien uses is the Vietnam War, which he knows well from first hand experience. Within that vehicle lies the horror of the My Lai massacre If the reader is a \"my country right or wrong\" sort of person, then this book is going to shatter a lot of illusions about war and country. If the reader is someone who likes the exploration of relationships, psyches, souls and the forces that damage those areas of life, then this is the book. I'd give it six stars if I could. I love it that much. ."}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "\"John Wade, you've just lost a big election and have been publicly shamed.

In this case, it just might be the husband. Through flashbacks, we learn all about John, and the more we know, the less we like him.In early November he began spying on her. He felt some guilt at first, which bothered him, but he also found satisfaction in it.Then, there's this . . .He moved with determination across the surface of his life, attending to a marriage and a career. He performed the necessary tricks, dreamed the necessary dreams. On occasion though, he'd yell in his sleep --- loud, desperate, obscene things --- and Kathy would reach out and ask what was wrong. Her eyes would betray visible fear. \"It wasn't even your voice,\" she'd say. \"It wasn't even you.\"O'Brien manages to work yet another very compelling Vietnam story into this one, but that plot line sadly takes a backseat to the main story. I found it interesting that, though this book predates Gone Girl by almost two decades, there's that similar unsettling vibe of an unlikable man who has trouble working up a public display of grief over his missing wife. \" . . . it might help to start acting like a husband.

Astoundingly good. Tim O'Brien has such a subtle mastery, it's almost frightening to read his work. He introduces a seemingly innocuous line on page 10 that sticks out just enough to make you wonder what it's true relevance is, then when he finally reveals it, a hundred pages later, it's devastating. As in The Things They Carried, O'Brien tells a riveting story that reverses back on itself multiple times, and also directly addresses the dilemma of storytelling, and the blurred lines between fiction, non-fiction, and truth. How do you tell a true story? How do you know what's true? Why do we need to uncover secrets we can never truly know?The story itself is not overly complicated: a promising young politician named John Wade suffers a crushing defeat after a dark secret from his past in Vietnam is revealed. Shortly afterwards, his wife disappears and Wade becomes a suspect. We see the story in the present, curl back to see Wade's experiences in the war, which are as chilling as any I've ever read, his relationship with his wife when it at first seemed to be innocent and loving, and see Wade's painful childhood where he first began to keep secrets from his loved ones and himself. Alternating chapters also hypothesize how events may have played out, while others present pieces of evidence as decontextualized quotes, both from characters testifying about the events in the story, and passages from real world biographies of major political figures and other works on relevant non-fiction. In footnotes that appear mostly in Evidence chapters, the narrator becomes a character, trying as desperately as the reader to tease a thread of meaning and truth from the dark. The narrator's identity remains as ambiguous as what really happened to the wife. This further problematizes the fiction/non-fiction line, as the narrator seems to have much in common with the author, but the other characters are supposedly creations of his imagination. This asks the question, how different is fiction from non-fiction? In both, the author and the reader struggle to find something true, something that is unknowable and unreachable.The latter half treads water for a time and over-explains ideas that are already clear, but the ending pulls every idea together beautifully."}, {"userName": "Petergiaquinta", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159895-petergiaquinta", "userReview": "Facts are simple and facts are straightFacts are lazy and facts are lateFacts all come with points of viewFacts don't do what I want them toFacts just twist the truth aroundFacts are living turned inside outFacts are getting the best of themFacts are nothing on the face of thingsFacts don't stain the furnitureFacts go out and slam the doorFacts are written all over your faceFacts continue to change their shapeI'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...--Brian Eno and David ByrneTim O'Brien is a magician and so in a lot of ways he's like Sorcerer, John Wade from In the Lake of the Woods, but instead of smoke and mirrors O'Brien uses words to tell true stories that never happened. And we believe those stories.Sure, all novelists tell stories that never happened, creating something out of nothing, but O'Brien does something a little more than just that, and this is why he is the best of our authors to come out of the Vietnam War and perhaps in fact the most important war writer of all time. O'Brien's take on the relationship between war and truth (often called a casualty of war) and what did or didn't happen and whether it really matters in the first place and how something can be true and never have happened at all are all particularly well suited for the mess of Vietnam and for all war stories in general.In Going after Cacciato O'Brien writes an entire novel stretching from Vietnam to Paris and back again that never happened. When I first read Cacciato, I had a hard time coming to grips with the concept--I think I might have felt gypped, as if reading those 350 pages had been a massive waste of my time, and this probably accounts for my lower rating of the book here in GoodReads. I don't think I understood what O'Brien was doing back then and was more likely yearning for something closer to the \"facts\" of the Vietnam War. Near the end of Cacciato, O'Brien writes, \"'Facts,' Doc Peret liked to say. 'Face facts.'\" And in response, PFC Paul Berlin thinks, \u201cThe facts were not disputed. Facts did not bother him. Billy Boy had died of fright. Buff was dead. Frenchie was dead. Pederson was dead. Sydney Martin and Bernie Lynn had died in tunnels. Those were all facts, and he could face them squarely. The order of facts\u2013which facts came first and which came last, the relations among facts\u2013here he had trouble, but it was not the trouble of facing facts. It was the trouble of understanding them, keeping them straight.\" I didn't get it then but now, as I flip through Cacciato again, I see O'Brien's magic at work.It took a while, but twenty-five years after Cacciato, I started to get it when I read The Things They Carried. In this book O'Brien begins telling a story, draws the reader in, and then pulls the figurative rug out from under his reader's feet by stopping the story and reminding him that he's reading a work of fiction, that the story he is so eagerly involved in never really happened. Then the narrator starts again, purporting to tell what did really happen, and again the man behind the curtain pops out to remind the reader that this story didn't really happen either. Here in Things, O'Brien introduces us to the idea of the \"true war story\" and again it's pure magic: \"You can tell a true war story by the questions you ask. Somebody tells a story, let's say, and afterward you ask, 'Is it true?' and if the answer matters, you've got your answer.For example, we've all heard this one. Four guys go down a trail. A grenade sails out. One guy jumps on it and takes the blast and saves his three buddies.Is it true?The answer matters.You'd feel cheated if it never happened. Without the grounding reality, it's just a trite bit of puffery, pure Hollywood, untrue in the way all such stories are untrue. Yet even if it did happen - and maybe it did, anything's possible even then you know it can't be true, because a true war story does not depend upon that kind of truth. Absolute occurrence is irrelevant. A thing may happen and be a total lie; another thing may not happen and be truer than the truth. For example: Four guys go down a trail. A grenade sails out. One guy jumps on it and takes the blast, but it's a killer grenade and everybody dies anyway. Before they die, though, one of the dead guys says, 'The fuck you do that for?' and the jumper says, 'Story of my life, man,' and the other guy starts to smile but he's dead.That's a true story that never happened.\"In the Lake of the Woods is full of true stories that never happened. For me, Lake just isn't as good as The Things They Carried, but it's still a great book that continues to look at these curiosities of facts and evidence and truth, all against the backdrop of a mystery of sorts involving the missing wife of a Minnesota politician with a penchant for making things disappear. John Wade, Sorcerer back in Vietnam, had been at My Lai but after making an entire village disappear he went on to make his whole experience there disappear until someone outs him during a primary race for the Senate. In the week after losing the primary in a landslide, Wade and his wife spend a week at Lake in the Woods, where she goes missing. It's almost like O'Brien is trying to write a post-modernist thriller, a who-dunnit without a solution or maybe with three or four or five solutions and O'Brien gives you all of them. Which one really happened? My younger self would most likely have felt gypped again, but just in case such a callow reader may respond in such a way there's the intrusive narrator again, this time popping in early on page 30 in a footnote: \"I have tried, of course, to be faithful to the evidence. Yet evidence is not truth. It is only evident. In any case, Kathy Wade is forever missing, and if you require solutions, you will have to look beyond these pages. Or read a different book.\"So you've been warned.Back to The Things They Carried:\"Now and then, when I tell this story [about soldier Rat Kiley torturing and killing a baby water buffalo in Vietnam], someone will come up to me afterward and say she liked it. It's always a woman. Usually it's an older woman of kindly temperament and humane politics. She'll explain that as a rule she hates war stories; she can't understand why people want to wallow in all the blood and gore. But this one she liked. The poor baby buffalo, it made her sad. Sometimes, even, there are little tears. What I should do, she'll say, is put it all behind me. Find new stories to tell.I won't say it but I'll think it.I'll picture Rat Kiley's face, his grief, and I'll think, You dumb cooze.Because she wasn't listening.It wasn't a war story. It was a love story.But you can't say that. All you can do is tell it one more time, patiently, adding and subtracting, making up a few things to get at the real truth. No Mitchell Sanders, you tell her. No Curt Lemon, no Rat Kiley. No baby buffalo. No trail junction. No baby buffalo. It's all made up. Beginning to end. Every goddamn detail - the mountains and the river and especially that poor dumb baby buffalo. None of it happened. None of it. And even if it did happen, it didn't happen in the mountains, it happened in this little village on the Batangan Peninsula, and it was raining like crazy, and one night a guy named Stink Harris woke up screaming with a leech on his tongue. You can tell a true war story if you just keep on telling it. And in the end, of course, a true war story is never about war. It's about sunlight. It's about the special way that dawn spreads out on a river when you know you must cross that river and march into the mountains and do things you are afraid to do. It's about love and memory. It's about sorrow.\"And those are exactly the three things that In the Lake of the Woods is about, love, memory and sorrow. O'Brien's war stories are always love stories. After you are given the evidence, the nature of things, and the various hypotheses, all that's left in Lake of the Woods is supposition and perhaps a happy ending, one that might remind you of Cacciato, if you substitute Verona this time for Paris. O'Brien writes, \"If all is supposition, if ending is air, then why not happiness? Are we so cynical, so sophisticated as to write off even the chance of happy endings?\" Maybe so, maybe happiness does \"strain credibility\" and the reader is more likely to lean toward the boiling, the scalded flesh and the body weighted down in the lake than to accept a disappearing act that ends happily ever after, but O'Brien isn't giving any answers here. In his final footnote, the man behind the curtain says, \"One way or another, it seems, we all perform vanishing tricks, effacing history, locking up our lives and slipping day by day into the graying shadows. Our whereabouts are uncertain. All secrets lead to the dark, and beyond the dark there is only maybe.\" That \"maybe\" takes us back to the final sentence of Cacciato, and again leaves us still waiting.When I was a kid the awful images of that ditch filled with bodies in My Lai were everywhere. I still can see those pictures in my mind, but today you probably couldn't get a classroom of AP U.S. History students to tell you what My Lai was. That's a disappearing act as well, one that rivals anything Sorcerer could do; it's the \"effacing history\" that O'Brien mentions at the end of Lake, some of it intentional and some of it merely the result of the passing of time. But we live in a post-Vietnam society where the president can create a fictitious war out of nothing, one that killed thousands of U.S. troops and tens of thousands of noncombatants, one where journalists are embedded into the invading forces and yet no images of the carnage were ever shared with the U.S. public. We live in a time when even the images of flag-draped coffins of our returning dead were disappeared by powerful magicians and now that this war is over (long after it was declared mission accomplished by the magician-in-chief) it's almost as though it never even happened. \"Could the truth be so simple?\" O'Brien asks in his final sentence, \"So terrible?\""}, {"userName": "Jeena", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5800503-jeena", "userReview": "First of all, this book made me realize how much I generally like most books that I read. Because this was a screaming exception.This is the basic summary of the story: In the Lake of the Woods is O'Brien's portrayal of a historian or biographer's attempt at piecing together the mystery of the disappearance of Kathy Wade. Kathy's husband, John, recently lost a primary election to become Minnesota's Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate after his involvement in the My Lai Massacre in Vietnam was revealed to the public.I hated the structure of the book. It was divided into the story, pages of weird evidence (quotes from other trials, from literature, from interviews of the missing woman's case), and hypothetical imaginings of where the woman was. I didn't care if they found her. I didn't care what happened to John, either.I hated John (the main character). I didn't care for his wife Kathy (the missing woman). I hated the story itself, I didn't care about anything that was happening to them. I just felt revulsion in how they portrayed John's obsession with his wife throughout college--he totally grossed me out. HATE. People on Amazon's reviews mostly loved it. But I really appreciated this particular negative review, because it totally got how I felt about it: \"This novel does not have enough thematic substance or emotional resonance to carry our interest. The symbolism is heavy handed and the protagonist lacks sympathy. His parents are caricatures, as are the other supporting characters. Kathy, the missing wife, is not developed as a character enough nor is their marriage compelling enough to induce our interest in their fate as a couple or as individuals. \"So glad it's OVER. Never have to read that one again."}, {"userName": "Mimi", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2490110-mimi", "userReview": "This is a deceptively angry book. It may look normal and unassuming on the outside, even boring, but on the inside, it's a slow-building, roiling, burning rage, the kind that sucks you in and makes you burn along with it. And I could not stop reading or even look away. Finished it in 36 hours. All I did this weekend was read this book and let it burn.Beautifully written, bitterly frustrating, angry and wholly unexpected.Looks real black and white now--very clear--but back then everything came at you in bright colors. No sharp edges. Lots of glare. A nightmare like that, all you want is to forget. None of it ever seemed real in the first place.[...]Would it help to announce the problem early on? To plead for understanding? To argue that solutions only demean the grandeur of human ignorance? To point out that absolute knowledge is absolute closure? To issue a reminder that death itself dissolves into uncertainty, and that out of such uncertainty arise great temples and tales of salvation?[...]I have tried, of course, to be faithful to the evidence. Yet evidence is not truth. It is only evident.[...]The afternoon had passed to a ghostly gray. She was struck by the immensity of things, so much water and sky and forest, and after a time it occurred to her that she\u2019d lived a life almost entirely indoors. Her memories were indoor memories, fixed by ceilings and plastered white walls. Her whole life had been locked to geometries: suburban rectangles, city squares. First the house she\u2019d grown up in, then dorms and apartments. The open air had been nothing but a medium of transit, a place for rooms to exist.The theme \"you can't ever go home again\" prevails infuriatingly throughout the writing, cementing the fact that, here in this story, you really can't go home again.Normally I hate fiction that leaves the reader without closure or an ending. Why read books that imitate real life when there's already too much real life in your own life? That has always been my reason for staying away from contemporary fiction. But it's different with this book and its open ending and lack of closure and lack of subtlety, all because it's Tim O'Brien (better known for his memoir of his experience in the Vietnam War, The Things They Carried). There's a sharpness to his writing that has always spoken to me. It's almost as though I get him and what he's saying. No one writes about memory and pain like Tim O'Brien, and no one writes about being lost in the wilderness of post-traumatic stress quite like he does.My heart tells me to stop right here, to offer quiet benediction and call it the end. But the truth won't allow it. Because there is no end, happy or otherwise. Nothing is fixed, nothing solved. The facts, such as they are, finally spin off into the void of things missing, the inconclusiveness of us. Who are we? Where do we go? The ambiguity may be dissatisfying, even irritating, but this is a love story. There is no tidiness. Blame it on the human heart. One way or another, it seems, we all perform vanishing tricks, effacing history, locking up our lives and slipping day by day into the graying shadows. Our whereabouts are uncertain. All secrets lead to the dark, and beyond the dark there is only maybe.This book found me at the right time and in the right state of mind to appreciate its infuriating complexity. In a different mood, at a different time, and I would have no doubt stopped reading somewhere about page 20. But there was something about this past weekend that made this book call out to me. Every word, every line, made sense in a way that contemporary fiction rarely does for me. Maybe it's Tim O'Brien. Or maybe it's simpler than that, maybe I just wanted to get lost in the woods or a lake (preferably one that's accessible only by helicopter).Cross-posted at https://covers2covers.wordpress.com/2..."}, {"userName": "K.D.

Decide for yourself. Whichever you choose, after closing this book, you'd feel glad that you've read it. Extraordinary. There's nothing like this among the 400+ novels that I've read so far.An ex-Vietnam War army turned politician, John Wade has lost his bid to the Senate. He and his wife, Kathy are debt up to their necks. Married for almost 2 decades, Kathy, 38, has been dreaming of having a baby. Busy with his career, John thinks that it is not yet the right time or maybe there is a deeper reason: his unhappy childhood or the secret of what happened in Vietnam. One day, John wakes up and finds that Kathy is gone. When we got married, did we tell all the stories of our past to our spouse? If the answer is no, how did we choose which ones to tell and which ones to keep to ourselves? Now that we are married, how much of our lives do we share with our spouse? When we arrive home at night, do we tell each and every detail of our day? How do we choose which ones to tell and which ones to keep to ourselves?\"Kill Jesus!\" is what John shouts in his dream. Beware guys, your secret can come out while you are dreaming and your wife is just there by your side wondering what those nightmares mean. So, even if you don't share everything, if it stinks, it will be known to her sooner or later.This book was recommended to me by 3 of my friends here in Goodreads. Three ladies. Maybe they think that I would probably learn a lesson from what happened to John and Kathy *chuckle*. Just kidding. O'Brien writing style is exceptional: At least 5 stories run in parallel (current, Vietnam, college days, John's childhood days and what could have probably happened) plus those chapters on exhibits which are composed of excepts from interviews related to the investigation of Kathy's disappearance or the John's war criminal case and even related literatures (quotes from Dostoevsky's Notes from the Underground, for example) on those. Normally, in this kind of storytelling approach, I would be confused and it would take me a long time to finish the book, e.g., The Known World by Edward P. Jones, as a recent read. But here, reading was a breeze and totally enjoyable because of its fresh approach and it leaves you a space to think: interpret the story and choose the ending that you want to believe happened.Thanks J, S, and T.

He saw himself from inside out and upside down, the organic chemistry, the twisted chromosomes, and for a second it occurred to him that his own stability was at issue. . . .

Did he kill her? In the end there are no answers only various possibilities. Tim O\u2019Brien only spent one year in Vietnam. Why did I feel disappointed when I read that? My first thought was \u2018shit, that\u2019s like me writing five books about that year in high school I worked at Radio Shack.\u2019 There are probably a lot of similarities between Vietnam and Radio Shack, so many in fact that I need not list them here. So what\u2019s the book about? The nature of memory, the secrets that we keep even from ourselves, the possibility of every really knowing another human being or even your own mind.

I like to think that my head contains somewhat original thoughts. The process of transferring those thoughts into coherently structured paragraphs has always been a challenge for me. But I digress.I was blown away. Definitely one of the best books I've ever read. It had the potential to be a jumbled, confusing mess of a novel, but O'Brien deftly preserves a perfect balance between mystery and romance. It really is a seamless and fluid combination of bitter memories and an even bitter reality, to the point where the boundaries of each are blurred. In spite of its nonlinear structure, the story, which switches from past to present and back again, does so with ease, never once spiraling into convolution. Deeply and carefully woven into the narrative is a sense of dread, especially the characters' relation to their northern Minnesotan surroundings. The lake is its own unique character. I didn't know what to expect, but I couldn't help but feel uneasy. Common are themes of isolation, obsession, remorse, marital distrust, political deception, repressed trauma, and above all the desire for love and acceptance; and in the last few chapters, these are all tied together in a way I didn't see coming. It is breathtaking and absolutely gorgeous.I can't really put it into words. I tried, but I believed I have failed. This is a novel that must not only be read, but experienced.

This time of year is particularly conducive to it. Spending an hour or two traveling a wasted winter landscape can do it to you too. You read a book like In the Lake of the Woods, and you might think you're pretty stable by comparison. But O'Brien will fuck with you. He'll teach you there is no truth. The only truth, he says, is the one you find by looking inward. But what if you're fucked? Then there is no truth. Mary said this was a book about pain. About being haunted. That's definitely the case. This is the perfect cure to all the glib holiday gusto. Fake it til you make it, eh? How bout you just lay all the cards out on the table and take what comes?

Got it for my brother in law this year for Christmas. He laughed when he saw the title. \"Your brother got me a book about a kid choking on donuts...\" \"--In the first couple pages, no less!\" I felt a strong connection to all the characters in Skippy. It's hard to imagine feeling a stronger connection to anyone on the written page, but O'Brien did it. I grieved with these characters as though I was sitting right next to them, offering them a blanket and a warm cup of tea. I couldn't very well tell any of them it was gonna be all right because that would be untruthful, no truth or not. But I feel like I was given the opportunity to sit with them in order that I might somehow come out of it a better person. One of those life changing books. One of those that no matter how hard you scrub, you'll never erase the weight it left you to carry. And you don't want to. If it were to leave, a part of yourself would then be missing.

The first, 'The Things They Carried,' is an extremely personal look into the dehumanization and commodification of the war, told with faux-bureaucratic detachment as a series of inventory lists. The second, 'Going after Cacciato,' is a surreal black farce, the 'Catch-22' of its generation. 'In the Lake of the Woods,' by contrast is set decades after the war, and deals with its irreversible aftereffects. In a worst-case scenario of PTSD, a seemingly successful veteran abruptly and spectacularly melts down in a tragedy of epic proportions. This ostensible war hero, an up-and-coming politician, was a participant in some particularly horrendous wartime carnage, and 20 years of denial has only succeeded in boiling his guilt down into a corrosive, explosive concentrate. Unlike Johnson, O'Brien is a Vietnam veteran, and it shows - not in portraying the details of the wartime experience, which Johnson nails just as accurately, or even in the moral ambiguities of war, but rather in the very specific ways that it annihilates the moral compass and makes men go mad."}, {"userName": "David Jarrett", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4560356-david-jarrett", "userReview": "A depressing book about two unhappy people whose marriage has been disintegrating daily due to the psychological problems of both.

The way the book is written, with chapters of vignettes and quotations from acquaintances and family members interspersed with narration in third person subjective, was very slow and rather boring to read. The writing is more literary than anything else -- certainly not a thriller -- and the reader is left with no closure at the end. This is a book I would not have read unless it had been chosen as the BOTM for October in the Goodreads Psychological Thrillers Group. It is psychological, all right, but NO THRILLER!

Lake of the Woods? Really? I was born in a community on the northern shore of The Lake of the Woods, but this story could not possibly be set in that wilderness! Or could it? Well, it is! The subject matter is one that I normally avoid but \u2014 how could I not read this book?It was a whirlwind. So much packed into a mere 300 pages. I careened through it in a record 36 hours! It\u2019s a mystery with a unique presentation \u2014 a crackerjack of a plot, complete with clues, hints, theories, and hypotheses, but NO ANSWERS. A wild, exhilarating ride for the mind and the senses!It\u2019s a very personal story of a veteran of the Vietnam War who, after the war, decided to serve his country as a politician. But for me the story is much more. It has transported me back to my \u201chomeland\u201d and to the years when the situation in Vietnam was swirling around (but not blatantly affecting) us in that wilderness place. We were geographically isolated from much of Canada but ironically so close to the American border. The novel encourages me to see those years from a different perspective, all these years later, and to ask broader questions about politics; the motivation and the modus operandi of politicians (then and now); the experiences of the soldiers at the My Lai massacre; the psychological impact of military training and active duty; and the effect on the spouse of both political and military service by their partner. This story packed a big punch and, for me, the greatest impact was the setting. I lived there, near The Lake of the Woods, when this fictitious story took place. The emphasis for me must be on the word \u201cfictitious\u201d. But could it have happened? Maybe a similar story did unfold while the \u201clocals\u201d, in ignorance and rural bliss, lived out their humdrum daily lives.

I read this solely based on another author recommend and the fact that Tim O'Brien was well-esteemed. I read two blurbs on the back, knew it was a mystery of sorts, and off I went.  The writing was good and the story did not feel dated for being published in 1994. There are no cell phones and there is mention of a landline, but that is obviously par for the course. John Wade has fallen from grace, losing a US Senate election by a 3:1 landslide. He and his wife take a breather for a few weeks in a little cabin...you guessed it-In the Lake of the Woods. They are secluded in Minnesota and unwinding/taking stock of their lives and what the future will hold. A few days into this depressing trip, Kathy disappears...along with a rowboat in the shed.  The novel then unfolds as a series of evidence snippets, John's remembrances of the events leading up to her disappearance, chapters hypothesizing how it could have happened,and investigative reports. Things are vague throughout, including the sections highlighting John's sketchy behaviors.  John has struggled with finding love and attention throughout his life. He had a troubled relationship with his father (who teased him for his weight), took to magic for attention as a child, seemed to be crying out for recognition as he joined the Vietnam war efforts, and sought the ultimate affirmation in his run for political elections. MAJOR DISLIKE: The long and profoundly disturbing sections detailing war atrocities, specifically mutilation of women and children. I knew he was struggling with PTSD and I'm not trying to downplay that, I appreciate that O'Brien showed the way soldiers (especially in this case) have to assimilate back into civilian life. The issue is the placement in the book and how long and detailed it was....if I wanted to read about the Vietnam War (and I think a reader should be prepared for that type of thing) I would just read The Things They Carried (I've heard Brian Cranston narrates this exceptionally on audiobook FYI:-).  It truly felt like a really exploitative way to add to the mystery of this lady and I really had a problem with it. Also, these highly graphic details are placed in the middle, so you are already invested in the story and do want to see where it pans out. Basically, it felt like the wrong medium to place such extreme content. I realize this opinion may be controversial, but the mystery was diluted in quite a disturbing way.

The quotes, which do seem to be random and distracting at first, make a point on their own, a point we have to construct for ourselves, about war, and sanity, and disappearance, and mystery, and the nature of truth in biography. I will skip the obligatory Tim-O'Brien-as-Vietnam-chronicler praise. I have known this to be true since the first time I read \"The Things They Carried,\" and nothing of his has ever changed my mind on that.There are some slow places in this novel, for sure, places where his elegant prose runs away from my attention, but that's a matter of a paragraph every now and then, and it wouldn't have been bothersome at all, except that the book's driving force was so driving, I just wanted it to keep going. The things that people seem to dislike, I liked. His parents weren't fully formed characters? Think about how dull and pointless over-developing them would have been. He repeats some passages? I just keeping thinking about how different they feel the second or third time.I know someone who is annoyed by the hint-dropping that he does early in the book, referencing Kathy being missing, the flies, a few other things. To me, these seemed a natural part of the book, but I understand how someone could see them as contrivances.It isn't a perfect book, of course, but it is a good one. I read this in a day, and it's not an easy book to read sometimes. There are several shudder-inducing pages, some things that I can't get out of my head. I also think it's important to know before starting the book (as I did, from reading the back) that the fate of Kathy remains unknown. We aren't being driven through the book by our desire to know where she ended up. There are other driving forces, unlikely ones, character-based, nuanced ones.

It's a novel about love, evil, obsession, memory, guilt, complicity, and the improbability of ever really knowing someone who doesn't want to be known, but above all it's O'Brien's attempt to come to grips with the My Lai Massacre. He creates an obsessed narrator who can't let go of the mysterious disappearance of Kathleen Wade, whose husband John was humiliated in a Senatorial campaign after his careful attempts to cover up his role in the slaughter of a village of Vietnamese civilians prove ineffective. The narrator tells the Wades' tale in three ways: 1) through \"reliable\" accounts of their life together based on research 2) through hypothetical projections of what might have happened to Kathleen and 3) through transcriptions of what amounts to a research notebook (quotes from interviews, real life excerpts from the testimony of the soldiers of Charlie Company, quotes from literature, lines from biographies of Nixon and Woodrow Wilson, a few lines from the last letter from Ambrose Bierce, etc.) None of the approaches work, so the narrator resorts to personal footnotes that clarify his struggle while muddling his attempts even further. Wade was a magician, and while he was unable to vanish the My Lai Massacre he may well have vanished his wife. Or maybe not. His own memory is so unreliable that even he does not know. Our narrator then, has an impossible task--to write with authority about an unsolvable mystery. Of course, that's what O'Brien's up to as well as he tries to make sense of senseless violence and evil. It's all expertly managed, and it's doing exactly what O'Brien wants it to do--sitting in my stomach like a stone.

Richard Thinbill's continued trauma about the flies that doesn't make sense at first but then makes more sense as it's repeated and the story is flushed out with other info to explain it, reminds me of Joseph Heller's horrifyingly hilarious conventions in Catch-22.John Wade's disconnect from the situation of his wife's being missing, his lack of outward expression of love or concern, his calloused, somewhat distant, cold approach to the situation, and his unreliability in terms of the events that happened around her disappearance, all make me wonder if Gillian Flynn happened to read this book before writing Gone Girl. And then the most obvious parallel I wanted to make throughout reading this book was to The Things They Carried, but oddly I found that harder to do than I'd expected, except for the whole war and ruthless killing aspect. What are we to make of how the story of Wade's horrifying experiences with the Charlie Company at Thuan Yen parallels what the \"Evidence\" chapters present about the British slaughtering the Americans during the Revolution and the Americans slaughtering the Native Americans? Perhaps O'Brien is making a commentary on the cyclical brutality of wars, where all are guilty of rage and vengeance and inhumanity? TTTC gave me a whole new level of empathy for those brutal killers and their state of mind, so now I wonder, is it fair or excusable for soldiers in those circumstances to say that, \"when you look back at things that transpired, things you did, you say: Why? Why did I do that? That is not me. Something happened to me\" (262). Another similarity I appreciate with TTTC is that it doesn't matter -- and we can't know -- if he actually did it, but he's guilty anyway and he grieved either way. And of course, there's our (unreliable?) footnote/authorial narrator, who sticks himself in and seems so truthful but confesses to having secrets and knowing about deception, not unlike the narrator Tim in TTTC. I still need to process all the recurring ideas running through the book and what they mean to me beyond the text, but I'm not sure I'll ever have answers so here they are: - Magic/disappearing/tricks/the mirror box/his Sorcerer title: Did John Wade use all this to hide from what happened to him, hide who he was? Or because he didn't know who he was? Or as the only way he knew of sharing who he was? Or a way of owning himself and her? Or maybe I should be wondering why O'Brien uses these devices more than why Wade does? (And don't we all present and start to then believe these alternate versions of ourselves, these tricks and illusions, though likely not quite so literally?) - The craving, the desire, the overwhelming need for love and adoration and acceptance as a result of some low self esteem or feelings of inadequacy, especially for public figures like politicians and war heroes (and personally speaking, pseudo-semi-public figures like teachers to a lesser degree?) - Why do the mostly-unwilling spouses support these public figures through all the politicking and the scandals despite how these partners must be destroyed by it? Or maybe occasionally they somehow manage to recover from it with renewed drive. (HRC?) - The frustrating impossibility of stopping the loop of death as a repeated act (because we keep replaying it?) and how people \"were never quite dead, otherwise they would surely stop dying\" (283). - Does one plus one equal zero, like those weirdo snakes swallowing one another's tails? Is that happiness? Is it possible? What if \"those two dumbass snakes had somehow managed to gobble each other up?\" (300). But of course we know \"Love wasn't enough. Which was the truth. The saddest thing of all\" (174). And perhaps most importantly, with everything else in this book, what is O'Brien saying about memory and truth and how our mind betrays us time and again and what it tricks us into believing or forgetting? Is that betrayal/repression a result of our guilt, or the only way to survive, or both? I so very much want answers to all my questions, but at some point I just need to \"Give it up. Totally hopeless. Nobody will ever know\" (266). I'm so hopeful of having so much answered for me when I see Tim O'Brien speak at Dominican University on Tuesday (7/19/16), but I'm pretty sure I will still be left with mystery and uncertainty and eternal doubt. And would I want it any other way? \"If all is supposition, if ending is air, then why not happiness?\" (299).\"But truth won't allow it. Because there is no end, happy or otherwise. Nothing is fixed, nothing is solved....All secrets lead to the dark, and beyond the dark, there is only the maybe\" (301)."}, {"userName": "Renee", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1812377-renee", "userReview": "This was a BOTM read for me.
