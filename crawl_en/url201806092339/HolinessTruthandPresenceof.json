It deals with the work of the Holy Spirit in our lives as He draws us closer to holiness...\"In our desire to know God, we must discern this about the Almighty: He resists the proud, but His grace is drawn to the humble....At some phase in each of our lives, we all will be confronted with the impurities of our hearts. The Holy Spirit reveals our sinfulness, not to condemn us but to establish humility and deepen the knowledge of our personal need for grace. It is at this crossroad that both holy men and hypocrites are bred. Those who become holy see their need and fall prostrate before God for deliverance. those who become hypocrites are they who in seeing their sin, excuse it and thus remain intact\". \"Therefore, sanctification starts not with rules, but the forsaking of pride\"\"If we are honestly pursuing our sanctification, we will soon discover we have not time for judging other. Indeed, being in need of mercy, we will seek eagerly for opportunities to be merciful to others\" (This idea is very similar to the writing of Bernard of Clairvaux's work, \"on humility and pride\")Frangipane talks about the process itself, seeking in prayer, being diligent and not giving up until we see the Glory of God. He deals with Hebrews - and does a really nice job explaining the old earthy tabernacle and now the new spiritual tabernacle and what Christ has done to make it possible for our souls to be a spiritual dwelling place for God. An interesting thought, he talks about once we succeed and God with Christ lives in us, what must we look like in the spiritual realm. \"We know how we appear to other men, but if God truly is within us, how do we appear to angels or devils? What light marks us in the spirit world, what illumination surrounds us. what glory declares to the invisible realm, 'behold and beware, here walks a son of God'? Think of it: the Spirit of the Creator, who purposed in the beginning to make man in His image, is in you....now\".I really like the way he ends the book.\"Our goal is to seek and to find the holiness that leads us into the true presence of God. Let us also bear in minkd that the Lord dwells in a secret place. No book, no teacher, no individual can discover for us what God's love demands we find for ourselves. if we know that we should seek God, we are debtors to our knowledge until we find Him\".\"Finally, simply do what you know to do. If you stumble, get up. If you sin, repent. Whatever you do, in spite of your feelings, do not lose your vision of Christlikeness. Your vision is your surest hope. Guard it. If you are faithful to your goal of Christlikeness, God will give you the grace to live in His presence. And when Christ, who is your life, is revealed, you also will be revealed with Him in glory\" (Col. 3:3-4)."}, {"userName": "Duane B", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7506575-duane-b", "userReview": "One of the most beautiful, impacting, heart transforming pieces of literature I've ever read. Forget about how to, prayer methods, study tips, improve your fellowship advice. This book brings you into the very presence of God, showing you His holiness as if it were right there in front of you waiting to be grasped. After reading this, I long for the holiness and presence of my Lord more than ever. A must, must read..."}, {"userName": "Ron", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1256262-ron", "userReview": "This is a really good book. Better than other, newer books by Frangipane. Was a solid four stars until chapters 20 and 21. Then his imagination and enthusiasm seems to have gotten the better of him. There's a good message in those chapters, the reader just has to be aware of the creative stuff.He also mis-attributes Thomas Acquinas' famous \"It's all straw\" quote to Augustine of Hippo."}, {"userName": "Robin Friesen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72864711-robin-friesen", "userReview": "Great book! Frangipane very simply explains what the Christian life is to be and how to live it."}, {"userName": "Amber French", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4224135-amber-french", "userReview": "As Christians, our desire should be to grow closer to God. Yet we become busy with life and sometimes put our relationship with God on the backburner. Frangipane\u2019s book is about making the decision to put forth the effort that relationship requires. He talks about maturity in God and how we acquire it when we start seeking God without an agenda. \u201cYet here we are not seeking God for things or even for other people. We are seeking God for Himself. Maturity starts as we break the cycle of seeking God only during hardships; holiness begins the moment we seek God for Himself.\u201d I enjoyed this book and one point he makes is something I find myself refusing to give in to. It\u2019s the idea of being content with fake Christianity. \u201cKnow for certain that the moment we stop obeying God, we start faking Christianity.\u201d No human relationship will survive if we don\u2019t invest our time and energy into it and the same is even truer of our relationship with God. Frangipane makes many good points, reminding me of things I\u2019ve grown up hearing but needed to have them brought to my attention once more. I liked that it was a quick read \u2013 definitely one I\u2019ll pick back up and read again."}, {"userName": "Wendy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/728421-wendy", "userReview": "I found this book while helping a friend clean up after a tornado took her house. It is POWERFUL, as if you are in the very presence of God! I could only read on chapter at a time before I had to go to my knees. It was indeed life changing.

I found myself wanting to read the book but shrinking back from it simultaneously: it's a tough read. But it's also more than worthwhile. My copy is dog-eared and highlighted to bits. Highly recommended for the man or woman who wants to give more; who comes to the cross no longer only to receive but to make daily sacrifices."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4400812-carol", "userReview": "This is my all time favorite book of Francis Frangipane.
