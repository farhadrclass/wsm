(correct me if I'm wrong). Where the last level, that is, the seventh gates, the human being reaches Zenith, the Paradise. In the book appears the word 'mitzvah', which means that there may be people who may have children, only if they can.What I take from this book is very simple:The human mind is so perverse that it reaches to being called a \"maniac absurdity\", whether in terms of gender differences, or of visible lucidity. I must say also (with regard to an article that is published in the Declaration of Human Rights), among other things, that every citizen, being male or female, has the right to choose their sexual, political and educational orientation, according to its basic principles. In Europe:The Portuguese and Spanish Jews are lovers of poetry.The Jews of the Central Europe are lovers of Prose.For what purpose were children and adults with mental disabilities?Most of these individuals with dental plaques, which were made of pure gold carat served to lampshades and ceiling lamps, as well as their epidermal tissues.These were the arguments I have drawn from this beautiful book.

I loved the historical fiction part of this. It was set in the time leading up to WWII and told from the POV of one of the 'perfect' people. So I liked that it was different in that respect. It also featured some ex-circus people who were considered freaks of nature. They too added interest. The writing was also quite beautiful. I loved his descriptions. It was eloquent in places and quite lovely. Now what I didn't like was pretty much only one thing...but it was a BIG thing.......the MC, Sophie. She was young and it was a trial for her and her family as the New Germany was taking center stage. Her character seemed fractured. It almost seemed like 2 entirely different people stitched together. So it was hard to accept her as viable character, and plus, the entire book is about her. It was too much of the same thread for me, mainly because she was always SO SO SO angry and sarcastic and mean. Also these were qualities shared by many of the other characters. Granted, they had reasons for being angry, but it started wearing thin. I wish other characteristics were employed to make them more unique and quirky. So the story gets a 2 and the writing gets a 4.....leaving the average sitting at 3 stars."}, {"userName": "Charles Weinblatt", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1012469-charles-weinblatt", "userReview": "Having reviewed The Warsaw Anagrams for The New York Journal of Books, this reviewer was attracted to another novel by Richard Zimler, who seems to have mastered the art of a \"murder mystery wrapped within the timeless anxiety and historical significance of the Holocaust. The Seventh Gate begins in contemporary America. Our infirmed and elderly protagonist, Sophie, is in a hospital. She appears not far from death. Her devoted nephew visits regularly and takes care of all of her needs. He is deeply interested in her past, especially what happened to her as a child and teenager in Germany. After a halting start, the author carries us back in time to her adolescent years, in 1932 Berlin. Young Sophie is a bright, inquisitive, artistic and sexually articulate fourteen-year-old, living in Berlin with her detached mother, ambivalent father and autistic young bother. She dreams of becoming an actress, cares deeply for her non-verbal and anxiety-prone brother, sexually desires her teenaged boyfriend and fights with her distant parents regularly. Her family is Christian, but not very devout. Sophie soon finds herself attracted to her enigmatic elderly Jewish neighbor, Isaac Zarco. Isaac is a kind, gentle, mysterious man, consumed with comprehending the Kabbalistic memoirs of his ancestor from Portugal. Isaac believes that the secrets of life, God and the hereafter are hidden within the cryptic writing of his ancestor\u2019s ancient document. Sophie is also captivated with Zarco\u2019s erudite collection of amazing Jewish friends, most of whom plot against Nazis in a secret group called \u201cThe Ring.\u201d The members include a charismatic troupe of former circus performers, including fascinating dwarfs and a tall, shadowy, deformed woman, named Vera. The members of The Ring are intriguing, delightful and amazing characters. When a young group member who has been a close friend to Sophie is sent to Dachau, she realizes that there must be a Nazi traitor in the group. But who? The remainder of this exciting novel follows Sophie through the war years as she falls deeply in love with Isaac, becomes a full-fledged member of The Ring and conducts a desperate race against time to save her brother and discover the traitor. Laden within this plot are several juicy sub-plots, including Sophie\u2019s anxious relationship with her cold mother and a love-hate relationship with her father who turned almost instantly from ardent Communist to full-fledged Nazi. Zimler carefully explores Sophie\u2019s loving relationship with her young autistic brother, Hansi. In every way, Sophie is a more devoted and empathetic parent to Hansi than her own parents have been. They are deeply embarrassed by Hansi\u2019s autism. But Sophie\u2019s protective love never falters. Despite his inscrutable silence, Sophie understands Hansi completely. As time passes, Sophie begins to realize the terrible danger posed by the Nazi-controlled German government, She fears losing her best friend, Rinsi, a Jew, as well as Isaac and the members of the Ring. Sophie\u2019s sexual relationship with a teenaged friend turns sour because of his ardent Nazi views. As time passes, Sophie is drawn farther away from her parents-turned Nazis and much closer to her Jewish friends, who are risking their lives to help Jews flee the Gestapo and concentration camps. As the years pass, Sophie falls more profoundly in love with Isaac, who is old enough to be her father, much less a Jew \u2013 constituting an illegal, if not also immoral relationship. Zimmler plays this liaison marvelously. The burgeoning love between them is a powerful force, played out against a world turned upside down by the Nazi genocide against Jews and the disabled. As the Gestapo closes in on our protagonists, Hansi is removed from home, to be sterilized because of his autism. Just as the Nazi State desires Jews dead, it follows that the disabled must go as well, in order for society to be more properly racially pure and Aryan. Zimler established himself as a successful murder mystery author during the Holocaust in The Warsaw Anagrams, in which a mysterious murder plot is gradually exposed within the infamous Warsaw Ghetto. Here he describes the fabric of life in Berlin exquisitely, as Nazis push down upon Jews until almost none remain. Zimler creates a murder mystery worthy of the great artisans of that genre. In The Seventh Gate, he ardently describes the traps of injustice upon Germany\u2019s Jewish and disabled citizens. Although one could argue that the Holocaust offers no easier disparity between good and evil, Zimler\u2019s character development is electrifying and his plot rolls along ever faster into the depths of fear. Zimler wraps all of this within the cryptic veil of Jewish mysticism. As he pours through his ancestor\u2019s Kabbalistic documents, Isaac begins to comprehend the route that humans take on their journey throughout life and beyond, the details of which go far beyond normal Jewish learning. These secrets are made available to him only through years of extensive study of Kabbalah. We learn that humans must pass through numerous \u201cgates\u201d if they are to gain entrance into heaven. Yet only the most learned and humane of us can pass. Zimler\u2019s use of Jewish mysticism within a murder mystery, within the dreadful steady Nazi drive into genocide, adds profound layers of thrilling detail to the novel.The Seventh Gate builds frustration and anxiety into a devastating and haunting conclusion. This is a shocking, evocative and thrilling novel, fueled by outstanding character development and a plausible murder mystery. Zimler creates heroic protagonists who struggle constantly against overwhelming odds. The elements of fear and death surround and invade each valiant character, made all the more lovable by their individual disabilities and charm. The Seventh Gate is gripping, consuming and shocking. Most importantly, as we contemplate the horrors inflicted upon innocent people by Nazi Germany, it remains all the more plausible. Through charming, brave and bright Sophie, Zimler helps us comprehend what it felt like to be a German with a good soul, within the writhing dark cloud of Nazism and its culture of intolerance and murder. Zimmler pushes several boundaries in The Seventh Gate. Sophie, a Christian teenager in Nazi Germany, falls in love with and has sexual relations with an elderly Jewish man. She breaks several laws and perhaps the hearts of some readers by loving and living with this endearing elderly Jew. She also explores sexuality at a time and age when it was considered to be inappropriate. Missing in this exemplary piece of evocative and haunting fiction is an epilogue. Why create a prologue if there is to be no epilog? We are left to wonder what life lessons the elderly Sophie could have given us at the conclusion, had the book returned us to the present-day. The Seventh Gate is thrilling, shocking, inspiring and unforgettable. Within it, author Zimler delivers taboo sexuality, prejudice, a deeply entrenched murder mystery, Judaism and the Kabbalah, World War II and the Holocaust - all wrapped within the veneer of Nazi Germany\u2019s terrifying shadow of hatred and bigotry. The reader will be haunted by these brave characters and the stirring murder mystery long after the book has been completed.Reviewer Charles S.

No. Not at all. Not to begin with. Not even at half way. This quartet about the past 500years of the life of Sephardic Jews funnelled through the policies of Portugal in the form of the Zarco family in its moves through Europe from the refuge haven of polyglot Turkey is in part my own history. I wanted this to be so much more.I wanted passion. Energy. Right from the startWhat I got was a thorough-going, scholarly and intricate depiction of the rise of fascism and Nazism in Germany of the first half of the 20thC. The insidious and incremental manner in which the whole general population might have been taken by surprise. At least until the final third. The entire text is meticulous in detail and likely emotions.The closely detailed lifestyle of devout Jews who were essentially productive and educated German citizens of long-standing, with closely drawn individual characters representing the many faces of the population.The essential relationship between avant-garde critical art and the intellectal survival of some sectors of the Jewish radicals is a stimulus to review the works, in particular of Dix and Chagall.Then in the final third of of this book, the slow, meticulous and at times lugubrious efforts begin to deliver the energy hoped for to that point.Like an Impressionist painting, the mass of pointillistic dots take perspectve and become a whole image.The sudden finish is somewhat baffling. Espe ially since there is no reprise to the opening, which could easily be the closing. A full circle.A young girl through her development in the 30's and 40's, through childhood to maturity is the vehicle and the link in portraying Aryan/Jewish emotions, customs, habits and attitudes one to the other. To detail too closely how she moves from being a young wdow in with a child in wartime Turkey and Berlin to a very elderly jewish 2nd time widow, ostensibly childless, in modern New York would destroy the texture of the tale.The mysteries of Nationalism and Judaism unfolded in layers, like carved meats, to be reviewed and digested slowly and thoughtfully."}, {"userName": "Phyllida", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11826040-phyllida", "userReview": "This is the best book of the Sephardic cycle of four books by Richard Zimler, of which this is the last. It takes a philosophical look at the treatment of Jews, the mentally and physically disabled and anyone who dared to be different in Nazi Germany from 1933 to 1945. The forced sterilisation of a woman suffering gigantism is horrifying. The book also offers a possible answer for why many didn't leave when they saw how things were going - they had commitments and thought normal Germans would rise up to defend them. It did make me wonder if the reason no one rose up was just plain fear that they would be next. The transformation of the character of Tonio from boyfriend to anti-semitic thug was very interesting - by the last time he appeared he seemed to have no memory that he had had friends and neighbours who were Jewish. Sophie's parents were fairly dreadful. Her brother Hansi probably had something that might be autism and would be understood today.It did help to have read the Last Kabbalist of Lisbon before reading this one because Berekiah Zarco comes up a lot but it does stand alone well too.

This book follows the life and trials mostly of Sofie Riedsel, a german young girl and Isaac Zarco, a descendant of Berekiah Zarco, the protagonist of the previous book, in the Germany of the National Socialism rising. It starts roughly around 1932 and it spans through the years, concentrating of course on the years prior and that led to the WWII.Sofie belongs to a german arian family and and has a neighbour who is around 50 years her senior and is jewish. In the start of the book, they lead their lives as normal, with only a wee shadow casting his spell: it\u00b4s the early start of the National Socialism Party and the power that he would hold. But in the begining of the book is just some party who got half a dozen votes for governament, too unimportant for anyone to give it a secund thought.Sofie is troding alongside her long life friend Tonio, hopping to become his girlfriend, dreaming of the day she would kiss him and marry him.she has a complicated relationshipwith her mother, who she considers cold towards her, a very complacent fhater and a brohter that is described as a \"distant child\" and is loved by the mother above all things.Isaac is their neighbour with some very peculiar friends. One day, he invites Sofie and her father to a party at his flat and she meets some of those friends and becomes changed for ever. From that moment on and until the end of her life she will always persue her own true self, not to be defined by the constrictions that Hitler\u00b4s government made, later on, not by her father, that \"changed skins\", not by her relationships that she will have in the course of her life. Her struggle within herself - the tugg between beying the daughter that her parents wanted, tending to her young brother and her own personnal beliefs of what is right, just - will make her grow immensly although not without slipping sometimes. But she is only human, after all!Without giving much in to the plot, i will say that books on this period are always emotional and heart-wrenching. It was difficult to read some passages, as the book is very weel researched and has some details brought tears to my eyes.There is one phrase that stuck in my mind, that Sofie said about Tonio, when he broke up with her and about her father, later on \" When people say what they are, we should listen - they are warning us.\""}, {"userName": "Filipa Marques", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23239448-filipa-marques", "userReview": "O Richard Zimler \u00e9 um hell of a writer!! Escreve lindamente e \u00e9 t\u00e3o inteligente! A S\u00e9tima Porta tem uma narrativa bastante encantadora e as personagens s\u00e3o imensamente cativantes, chorei a s\u00e9rio com o Hansi, magoou-me o pai da Sophie e sabe Deus o que mais... Vale tamb\u00e9m a excelente transposi\u00e7\u00e3o para o per\u00edodo da ascend\u00eancia do nacionalismo na Alemanha! em que em Berlim, como em todo o lado, a Hist\u00f3ria s\u00f3 se sabia \u00e0 metade, n\u00e3o que se tenha aqui um banho de Hist\u00f3ria, mas, enfim, o Zimler \u00e9 fant\u00e1stico!Tendo a fugir das hist\u00f3rias do Holocausto, enerva-me o excesso de explora\u00e7\u00e3o do Holocausto, mas a verdade \u00e9 que h\u00e1 sempre alguma coisa que ainda n\u00e3o sei, e \u00e9 verdade tamb\u00e9m que me comovo sempre.O motivo pelo qual me fico pelas 4 estrelas, \u00e9 que achei desnecess\u00e1rias e ou demasiadas, as cenas er\u00f3ticas. E ainda achei que a hist\u00f3ria peca por no final, haver uma certa quebra em motivar-me a adorar o Hans, parece que foi esquecido. Ele, com a heran\u00e7a enorme que tem, n\u00e3o foi trabalhado, parece-me, o suficiente. H\u00e1 aqui qualquer coisa que me faz n\u00e3o amaaaaar o livro, ainda que o considere bastante bom! BTW (Spoiler): eu odeio encontrar incongru\u00eancias, e, francamente, posso n\u00e3o ter compreendido exactamente essa parte por estar a ler em excesso de velocidade, mas, quer me parecer que no in\u00edcio do livro, quando a Sophie est\u00e1 moribunda a contar a hist\u00f3ria, a ideia que tenho \u00e9 que pede ao sobrinho do Ben que conte a hist\u00f3ria ao tal sobrinho que est\u00e1 na Turquia (que vai-se a ver \u00e9 o Hans), mas no final, ela explica que contou a hist\u00f3ria toda ao Hans, e que \u00e9 aqui que quebram o \"Inverno\"! Ora a ideia que me d\u00e1 \u00e9 que isto de estar a contar a hist\u00f3ria ao sobrinho do Ben \u00e9, enfim, uma desculpa esfarrapada para nos contar a n\u00f3s leitores, mas, n\u00e3o convence l\u00e1 muito.. e \u00e9 pena!"}, {"userName": "Fiona", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1356469-fiona", "userReview": "Rather then focusing on the Jewish holocaust and 'evil Nazis' this book focuses on the other people, less heard (or cared) about during the second world war.The Seventh Gate tells the story of a young girl named Sophie during the rise of Nazism in Berlin. She, unlike the many, fights against the popular ideology of the time. She befriends a group of people - a Jew, a Giant lady named Vera, the blind, deaf and dwarfs. Her brother is probably autistic, I don't think the book ever says but he is different from the norm.In History, in many World War 2 books we do not learn how many children were 'euthanised' because they were disabled. Or that people deemed to be abnormal in any way were forcefully sterilised. When you think about the WW2 we think of bombs and the persecution of the Jews. Though we are aware possibly, of what else went on, it isn't really focused on.This is a good book, a good story and very well written by the author. The only thing that bothered me was that Sophie, who met Isaac at the age of 14 - went on by the age of 18 (or maybe younger, I can't remember) to fall in love and have a baby with him.Other then that though, I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is full of striking emotion - love, courage, horror, sadness and hate. How I hated Sophie's father and Tonio too.

O ritmo \u00e9 recuperado a partir do instante em que Sophie se v\u00ea obrigada a sair da Alemanha, levando o leitor sempre a querer saber mais sobre o desenlace final (se bem que, de certo modo, previs\u00edvel).Em suma, \u00e9 um livro bastante interessante que valer\u00e1 a pena ler.
