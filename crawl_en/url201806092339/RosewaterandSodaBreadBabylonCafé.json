The very mean lady kept trying to get rid of the sunflower, and the book ended with \"And the sunflower did something to her...\" This book reminds me a lot of my sisters book. Not because Marsha Mehran is my sister or six years old, but the book was filled with all kinds of starts but no ends. Layla wants to have sex... Something happened to Marjan in the detention center... The old biddies across the road are going to put an end to the restaurant once they go pee and eat more biscuits... Bahar used to be married... It's just tedious after awhile. I wanted to like this book, the story of sisters and food, yes please! I thought it would be something similar to Like Water for Chocolate and was totally disappointed. The mentions of food are more \"the soup smelled good!\" and less deep emotional experiences. And hello stereotypes! Estelle the Italian widow \"oh, me and Luigi, he maka tha pasta!\" The Catholic ladies across the street, all spinsters, all mean and nasty meddling types. Oh, but the Iranian sisters, they are dark! mysterious! sexual! The Irish girl, you guessed it - red hair and pale skin!

Their lives are changed when a mysterious \u201cmermaid\u201d girl with a dark secret washes up on the beach. They have trouble fitting in their strict Catholic town, but the three sisters bring excitement to their sleepy little village. This story is similar to the authors own life. Marsha Mehran was born in Tehran and she escaped the Iranian revolution to live in the US, Argentina, and Australia where her parents owned a Middle Eastern caf\u00e9. She now lives in the US and Ireland. This is her first book.  I found the setting of this book to be the most interesting. The setting of a small village on the coast of Ireland was uncommon and striking. The characterization was also interesting. Each of the characters had their own distinct personality. I also liked the way the novel was written with alternating points of view.\tOne weakness that I found in the novel was that the plot moved along too slowly. The author could have cut out some of the scenes with Mrs.Quigley (the gossiping old lady) and her friends. I also would\u2019ve liked to know more about Layla, the youngest sister. Instead, most of the novel focused on the eldest sister Margaret. Additionally, some of the story lines seemed to end unresolved. For example, the sisters figure out that the girl they found on the beach ran away from her home, they find her father, she returns back home, then the storyline just forgets about her. Even though I liked the alternating points of view, the multiple storylines with multiple points of view made the novel a little hard to follow. \tOverall, this novel was fairly enjoyable despite its weaknesses. Anyone who likes cross-cultural stories would enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "Mai Laakso", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49155830-mai-laakso", "userReview": "Aminpourin kauniit iranilaiset sisarukset Marjan, Bahar ja Layla tulivat tutuiksi Lumoavien mausteiden kahvilasta, joka kirjassa sai nimen Babylonian cafe.

Basically, it develops the sister's lives more and also includes a new mystery character. One great thing was that this book showed us a different side of Marjan. I really liked how Pomegranate Soup opened up each chapter with a recipe...this book doesn't. It does, however, have the recipes of the mentioned dishes in the back of the book.

And she's cloyingly precious.The love scene with Our Heroine and Our Hero (who is pretty 2 dimensional) on the castle terrace has dialogue worthy of a cheap Harlequin paperback.

While the first books had me very invested in the protagonist and her sisters, this one kind of kept me at arms reach, and I kept feeling that the tension was being deliberately ratcheted up to give the story more oomph - almost forced farce at times.

It was a bit expensive for a totally blind try at a new author, so I didn\u2019t buy it, but I did file her name away in the back of my mind. Not long after, she was mentioned on a mailing list I\u2019m on, and I discovered this is actually the second book of two. Of course, that meant I had to go and find the first one and read that first. I tracked it down easily (I used the search engine on the local library\u2019s website!) and borrowed it. Pomegranate Soup was a lovely novel about the three Iranian Arminpour sisters trying to open a Persian cafe and start a new life in a small Irish village. Even before I finished it, I\u2019d put a reserve on the sequel.In Rosewater and Soda Bread (isn\u2019t that a lovely title?), it\u2019s been a year since the end of Pomegranate Soup, and while there are still people in the village who view the sisters with suspicion, they are now well established and starting to feel settled. Marjan finds herself attracted to an Anglo-Irishman returned to Country Mayo to restore the family estate, Bahar is taking steps towards a new peace and major commitment and Layla and her boyfriend Malachy think they might be ready to take their relationship to the next level. Meanwhile, their landlady, Estelle, finds a young, pregnant girl washed ashore in the bay and takes her in, despite indications she has broken Irish law. Marjan becomes involved and eventually her sisters too. Everything weaves together in the end and Marjan comes to some significant realisations about her relationship with her sisters and her potential relationship with Julian.I really enjoyed this book, more even than Pomegranate Soup. The magical element is less in this book, although there is some definite and at least partially mystical mystery about the girl Estelle rescues. I thought it worked better, as while Mehran tells a lovely story, she doesn\u2019t do the blending in of magical realism as well as some authors (I am reminded noticeably of Sarah Addison Allen, since I read her books Garden Spells and The Sugar Queen recently). This book is more focused on Marjan than it is on Bahar and Layla, and while the latter still have significant roles in the story, it is largely filtered though how their actions affect Marjan and her understanding of them.Mehran raises issues about Irish laws on birth control and abortion, but there is no preaching, just an indication of how complicated the situation is (the book is set in 1987 and I don\u2019t know how things have or haven\u2019t changed since then). I think the actions of the characters may give an indication of Mehran\u2019s own opinions, but I could be totally wrong as their is nary a soapbox in sight and the characters all act true to themselves. Again, it is primarily Marjan\u2019s reactions that the book explores, both as she tries to come to turns with Layla\u2019s request that Marjan procure condoms for her and Malachy and as she explores the mystery of the stranger\u2019s identity and actions.Marjan\u2019s tentative romance with Julian is delicately depicted as she tries to let go of her past to make a try for the future, and while I\u2019m not totally convinced Julian is the man for her, I do believe this relationship is something she needs to explore. She begins to realise important things about herself in the process as she sees how circumstances have perhaps left her over-managing her sister\u2019s lives.The last paragraph, as she embraces Bahar\u2019s choices even if she doesn\u2019t understand them, was beautiful and a delightful way to end the book. I really hope Mehran is planning to tell us more about the Arminpour sisters as, while we left them all in a good place, there is clearly much of their story still to tell.Rosewater and Soda Bread Marsha Mehran Arminpour Sisters, Book 2 9/10Qualifies for: 100+ Reading Challenge, Support Your Local Library Reading Challenge"}, {"userName": "K.

There is truly nothing better than a food-based, lyrical description of a culture mixed with young women healing or discovering themselves.Three sisters who have escaped from Iran to live in a small town in Ireland open a cafe. They must contend with small-town prejudice, memories of the terrible events in Iran, and Catholic morals when their best friend, an elderly Italian widow, picks up an injured, young girl on the seaside who will not speak.The story is mostly told from the eldest, Marjan's point of view. She spends a lot of time preparing food in the cafe talking about the ingredients in the same kind of lush, magical description that reminded me both of Chocolat and The Mistress of Spices.The food descriptions and the romance between Marjan and her suitor made me swoon. Very romantic:\"You need to say yes to me.\" He looked at her intently, those green eyes taking on the color of the forest.\"Yes?\" She felt so dizzy. For a moment it seemed as though they had been walking a maze for days.\"Yes to dinner. This Friday night. Yes to seeing me again. And again.\"But while the beginning promised much in terms of hefty, delicious character building, the events around the second's sister, Bahar's, marriage that sent them running to Ireland are mostly hinted and referred to obliguely, and since Bahar and the third sister, Layla, have less camera time, I never felt like I really got to know them well enough because we were too busy with the local neighborhood busybody or the Italian Widow.I was also tripped up a couple of times with just slightly off word use. This could be Irish or UK uses of words I'm not familiar with, but I've read a lot of British fiction and never had to reread sentences to realign meaning in my brain so many times-- and this possibly leads to the somewhat distant feeling I had for everyone but Marjan in this book.\"Marjan had been so engrossed in Julian's voice that she had not even noticed that the woods had finished their haunting\" (when there was no prior mention of ghostly or darkness really to help along the meaning of haunting)or\"Sure, a walk to the mini-mart or the Butcher's Block did help break up the monotony of her sister's carps, as did the highlight of her day, the only lining in her ever-constant cumulus: noontime Mass inside Saint Barnabas's alabaster hush.\" (where I had to go back and reread to understand \"carping\" instead of \"goldfish\")I'm not going to give you even a taste of the food imagery, because I think it would spoil the fun of discovering Marjan's world. Despite my petty grievances, this book is worth your time, both for the food and for the interesting juxtaposition of Persians in a small, Irish town. Even with its small faults, this is a delicious dish of a story about healing and daring to live again."}, {"userName": "Strivetoengage", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62744148-strivetoengage", "userReview": "I bought Rosewater & Soda Bread second hand after being attracted by its cover art but also because its author is a member of the Iranian diaspora and I enjoy reading about Iran. This is the 2nd novel by Marsha Mehran, an author who, like her protagonists (three orphaned sisters) left Iran on the eve of the revolution. Mehran has also lived in Ireland, which is where her novel is set. Mehran\u2019s parents ran a cafe as do her protagonists.The three foci of the book are food, faith and love with some magic realism associated with food and healing. There were certainly aspects of the book that I enjoyed reading, such as the descriptions of Persian food, pleasant evocations of Irish countryside, and about the lives of Irish villagers. I particularly liked Estelle, the widowed Italian woman who pines for her husband, and Fiona the hairdresser who encourages her lovesick staff member to read The Female Eunuch. However, I had higher hopes for the scope of the story and the character development than Mehran was able to deliver. It\u2019s a light story that features a love story that is unbelievable, between the eldest sister Marjan and landed gentry Julian, a focus on religion that made me feel uncomfortable, and a sub-story about a teenage girl who tries to abort a baby. The attempted abortion is scandalous (and illegal) in 1980s Ireland and Mehran gives some interesting background into the topic. The story of the girl left me scratching my head however because it seemed implausible that she would do that to herself.Mehran alludes to suffering of the two older sisters in Iran but she does not give details. That sounds like I want to read about misery but I actually was just looking for more substance. It\u2019s easy to allude to past suffering but more difficult to substantiate it in a believable way. I realise that Rosewater & Soda Bread is the sequel to Pomegranate Soup, which I haven\u2019t read, and Mehran probably develops the back story of her characters in that novel. However, the edition that I read does not indicate that it is a sequel, so I think that Mehran needed to do a better job of making this a truly standalone novel.While doing some research to write this post I discovered that the author Mehran died in April this year, at the age of 36.

Together make for a beautifully written tale which drags you from cover to cover and feeds you at the end (with the recipes at the back of the book).

As the title says, this is a novel about three sisters (Marjan, Bahar, and Layla), two countries (Ireland and Iran), and the language of food. The author pulled off the language of food (including restorative and medicinal properties), and there are 8 tasty sounding recipes from Ireland or Iran at the end of the book. The portraits of Ireland and Iran while slightly incomplete were well painted. The three sisters are realistically presented, each with their own backstory, personality, and dreams. The problem is that many of the secondary characters drawn into the story simply disappear. I'm not sure if Ms. Mehran didn't know how to end it, became bored a little over half way through, was told by her publisher that she was out of pages, or intends to write a sequel, but for whatever reason it all kind of just ended. You know how you're never supposed to resolve a problem by having the character wake up? Well, the resolution to this story's problem stopped just one step shy of this. The girl left (I don't want to give anything away so I'll leave this rather vague statement at that), and all of the people inconvenienced, jeopordized, or in trouble with the law are left hanging out there with the reader left to guess whether they're still in trouble or everything was miraculously resolved. Is it worth reading?

While aspects of the story did not appeal to me as much as the earlier book, the inclusion of some delightful and relatively simple Persian recipes made the experience more satisfying. This is a comparatively light read, and I enjoyed reacquainting myself with the Aminpour sisters, and the people of Ballinacroagh.Jennifer Cameron-Smith"}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5861493-michelle", "userReview": "This is the sequel to Pomegranate Soup and continues the stories of the 3 Iranian sisters living in Ireland, running a cafe. The three sisters are each becoming more comfortable in their new home and each is branching out towards love. Layla continues her romance with her Irish boyfriend and they consider taking their relationship to the next step. Marjan meets a local man recently returned home to his family's estate. He intrigues her with his knowledge of Iran, but also scares her because she is unsure if she is ready to begin a relationship. Bahar, who appeared to be interested in a gypsy man in the previous book has now turned to a deeper calling and is exploring a relationship with the Catholic Church. Intermixed with the tale is a \"mermaid\" that their friend Estelle rescues who turns out to be a damaged pregnant girl with a healing touch. While I enjoyed this sequel, there were several plot lines that seemed to be just dropped midstream or end in a strange way. Overall it was a fairly good book with just a hint of magical realism. The door was left open for a third book, but it is unclear at this time whether or not there will be one."}, {"userName": "Bookfanatic", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4398710-bookfanatic", "userReview": "This is the sequel to Pomegrante Soup: A Novel by the same author. If you haven't read the previous book, you might be somewhat lost following this book. I loved Pomegrante Soup for its story and the delicious Persian recipes.  Rosewater and Soda Bread is very good, but I love the first book better. At times, this second book gets lost with too many characters and competing storylines. Rosewater is similar to books like Chocolat, Like Water For Chocolate, Baker's Apprentice. Food and the love of food are big themese in all these books. When Rosewater and Soda Bread opens, Marjan and her two sisters who fled the Shah's Iran, have been running the Babylon Cafe for a year in a small town in Ireland. For the most part, they've been accepted by the villagers although several busybodies are still determined to get them out. Much of the story revolves around the beloved Estelle Delmonico, a friend to the Iranian sisters, and the young woman Estelle finds washed up on the beach, nearly naked and injured, and mute. Overall, this is a cozy book full of tempting descriptions of Persian food. It's a very tame, family-friendly book that can be read by a grandma or teen."}, {"userName": "Ladiibbug", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/700357-ladiibbug", "userReview": "Best enjoyed as a sequel to the fabulous Pomegranate Soup, but can be read as a stand aloneA wonderful story of three Iranian women who flee the Revolution and finally settle in a quaint Irish town. The sisters' Persian cafe quickly becomes a bit hit with the locals, and the exotic foods are a nice part of the books (recipes included).Each book weaves a tale of the sisters' individual lives, their lives together working at the cafe, and the friendships with the very colorful locals.I like the exploration and blending of cultures ... we learn bit by bit about the sisters' lives living under the Shah's rule, a bit about their time in London. The small Irish town is strictly Catholic, and not all of the residents welcome anyone or anything outside a very narrow set of what is \"acceptable\" in their village.Ms. Mehran is a talented writer, and I'm hoping she's planning a third book. So far no such info on her website. She certainly leaves the door open for future developments!www.marshamehran.com"}, {"userName": "Imogen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2108081-imogen", "userReview": "The sequel to Pomegranate Soup, I loved this book JUST as much as Pomegranate Soup.I had that sad feeling at the end when i knew i was leaving the characters behind. At least with Pomegranate Soup there was a sequel i could look forward to! But I dont know of a third book involoving the Aminpour sisters. If Marsha Mehran publishes another one, I will DEFINITELY be reading it :)The book follows on just a bit after where Pomegranate Soup left off, with the three sisters running the Babylon Cafe in a quiant Irish village. The only thing i didnt like was the book concentrated on different characters and points of view from the previous book. For example, Thomas Junior going to America at the end of Pomegranae Soup was quite a major part in the novel, but he is only briefly mentioned once or twice - i wanted to know what happened to him! Same with his father Thomas, not much is said about his current state.However, these things are cancelled out by how great the book was :)I recommend it to anyone who loved Pomegranate Soup!"}, {"userName": "Petersong", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5771343-petersong", "userReview": "This is simply a nice book. The descriptions of Persian cooking made me hungry.It is the story of three sisters who fled Iran in the 1980s. They run a cafe in Ballinacrough, not too far from Croagh Patrick in the Irish west coast county of Mayo.I was less interested in the story of the mysterious young woman found washed up on the beach than I was in Marjan finding happiness.It was an amazing coincidence that the John Wayne movie set in Ireland, \"The Quiet Man\", is mentioned in the book on a number of occasions. While I was reading the book Rachel returned from Ireland and England with a gift for me from Lena: a dvd of \"The Quite Man\".One criticism I have is that I was left wondering what happened to Father Mahoney, Derva Quigley and her sister, Marie Brennan. As usual, I loved the romantic tension which was between Marjan and Julian.I hope to make some of the recipes included in the book: gormeh sabzi, colcannon, chickpea cookies and rosetachio icecream. I have now made the colcannon and my Irish wife did not like it; I thought it was delicious."}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8618401-april", "userReview": "I enjoyed this book better that Pomegranate Soup because it focuses less on sisters' inability to cope with their past trauma in Iran and more on the ways they are able to \"find strength in what remains.\" There are a lot of likable secondary characters, too, like an older Italian widow named Estelle and the local Priest who also works as a discjokey (lol). The most interesting part, to me, was the storyline of the middle sister, Bahar, who decides to convert to Catholicism. I would have read an entire book about her journey, rather than having to tolerate the oldest sister's (Marjan) love affair with a blond-haired, green-eyed, broad-shouldered wealthy Londoner writer man. Just sayin'. Like I said before, this is good reading if you don't want to think too much and just want to enter into another world."}], "description": "\u201cMehran\u2019s novel delights the senses on every page. The story pulses with life as three Iranian sisters struggle to make sense of matters of the heart and the spirit.\u201d \u2013Elizabeth Cox, author of The Slow MoonMore than a year has passed since Marjan, Bahar, and Layla, the beautiful Iranian Aminpour sisters, sought refuge in the quaint Irish town of Ballinacroagh. Opening the beguiling Babylon Caf\u00e9, they charmed the locals with their warm hearts and delectable Persian cuisine, bringing a saffron-scented spice to the once-sleepy village. But when a young woman with a dark secret literally washes up on Clew Bay Beach, the sisters\u2019 world is once again turned upside down. With pale skin and webbed hands, the girl is otherworldly, but her wounds tell a more earthly (and graver) story\u2013one that sends the strict Catholic town into an uproar. The Aminpours rally around the newcomer, but each sister must also contend with her own transformation\u2013Marjan tests her feelings for love with a dashing writer, Bahar takes on a new spiritual commitment with the help of Father Mahoney, and Layla matures into a young woman when she and her boyfriend, Malachy, step up their hot and heavy relationship. Filled with mouthwatering recipes and enchanting details of life in Ireland, Rosewater and Soda Bread is infused with a lyrical warmth that radiates from the Aminpour family and their big-hearted Italian landlady, Estelle, to the whole of Ballinacroagh\u2013and the world beyond.Praise for Marsha Mehran\u2019s Pomegranate Soup\u201cA mouthwatering tale with flavors of Chocolat and Under the Tuscan Sun . . . sinfully sweet and satisfying.\u201d\u2013Orlando Sentinel\u201cGlorious, daring, and delightful, filled with humor, hope, and possibility.\u201d \u2013Adriana Trigiani, author of the Big Stone Gap novels\u201cAn enchanting tale of love, family, and renewal.\u201d\u2013Firoozeh Dumas, author of Laughing Without an Accent", "title": "Rosewater and Soda Bread\n      \n          (Babylon Caf\u00e9 #2)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2287340.Rosewater_and_Soda_Bread", "average": 3.42, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320531783l/2287340.jpg", "reviews": 186, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/285453.Marsha_Mehran", "name": "Marsha Mehran"}], "type": ["Cultural", "Fiction", "Cultural", "Food and Drink", "Magical Realism"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2287340.Rosewater_and_Soda_Bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26092585-ruusuvett-ja-lammaspataa", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6255096-rosewater-and-soda-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/513617.Pomegranate_Soup", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25271826-the-saturday-night-school-of-beauty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13394414-ko", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
