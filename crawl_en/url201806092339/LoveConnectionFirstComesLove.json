Having two parallel-running story-lines with the same characters but different choices, intrigued me a lot at first. That is, until I noticed the author keep going back to the same things in both storylines.Although I do get the why, it got on my nerves she sometimes uses the exact same descriptions and dialogues in both story lines.The other issue I had was conversations sometimes feeling very forced and the main character having the tendency to have a childish whine-moment once in a while.It was a cute read, but it wasn't really anything special to me.3 / 5"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14045562-amy", "userReview": "Full review on www.novelgossip.comThis book caught my attention as I think we\u2019ve all wondered how our lives could have turned out completely differently had we made other choices and in Love Connection you get to see how Gemma\u2019s life could be by making both choices and seeing her two very unalike lives side by side. She can either attend her best friends wedding as the maid of honor, or crash her exes wedding and reveal her true feelings. Which choice does she really make? And will the outcome really change much or is fate guiding her to the same place either way?Gemma is such a fun character. In fact, all of the characters here are loads of fun. Besides Gemma you have her best friend Amelia. The two are quite the pair and they have a deep friendship full of humor and true understanding. Several of their scenes made me giggle and after finishing such a heavy novel a bit of lighthearted fun was exactly what I needed. Jake is Gemma\u2019s ex and the one that got away. He\u2019s moved on and is getting married on the same day as Amelia, hence Gemma\u2019s huge decision. Lastly there is Richard who is the new man in Gemma\u2019s life. He is utterly charming and quite the catch but Gemma can\u2019t quite seem to completely let go of her past and embrace her future.It was really fun and interesting to read this one. Every chapter alternates between both choices; one chapter with Gemma heading to Amelia\u2019s wedding and the other to Jake\u2019s. I was dying to see how it would all end and I was not disappointed, although I\u2019m rather eager for book two in the series now! Filled with witty banter, humor and heart Love Connection is a delightful read that will make you feel good and leave you with a smile on your face.

Women's Fiction. :: 5+ Pretty Little Stars :: WOAH. This is one of the most  unique  books that I have read in a  long  time. Camilla Isley has outdone herself with this novel and I couldn't be more pleased with how it all turned out. What do you do when you have to make a decision? This is the essential plot of this book. One woman. Two life choices. Each with different endings. So what would she choose, and what happens when she gets there?This book is AMAZING. I was a bit concerned at first thinking that the plot would be confusing as every other chapter features one of the life choices, and the next chapter the other. But this was NOT confusing at all. Perhaps its because it is so well written that we can easily follow along, or maybe its because we need to ALSO CHOOSE which path would be better suited. Either way, it's not a confusing story, rather one that is so interesting that you will be hooked. Anyway, I have now read a few of Camilla Isley's novels and I have to say that each and every time I have been impressed. Now I can't wait to see what the second book in the series is like...

The way these two stand by each other, love each other and is there through good and bad is AMAZING. It is one of my favorite BFF duos I have ever read! They are hilarious despite what is going on. I know y'all will just adore them.There are also three men you will fall in love with. Dylan, Jake and Robert. Even though the story maybe different for all three of these guy.

There's sadness, happiness, laughing and crying at the same time.I was intrigued starting at chapter 2 when I realized that you see both option she could choose. I felt embarrassed with Gemma as she had to cancel a wedding, looking like hell, after riding on a hay/chicken transporter. Laughed my ass off at her inner conversations with herself and had a hard time to decide which way would be my choice. Once I liked one option better and loved the new characters introduced the other path came running back with some golden points in his pocket, like a mother-in-law who just rocks! I loved that there were a lot of movie examples, for certain situation. It just gave you the perfect idea for that scene and was hilarious as hell. Just saying Sex-and-the-city and 27-Dresses vibes going on here! ;)Getting closer to the end it even got a bit mysterious because of a special bachelorette/hen party activity. By then I was wondering if Gemma would be dreaming or even living both lives. :D The ending just took my breath away and I finally could decide what's best for all. Crying over how cute and romantic the two worlds are combined I can just recommend this book to all romantic birds out there who love not only to cry but to laugh full of joy!!All in all I really liked this book and am so glad I got to read it.

I am generally quite skeptical towards those sorts of thoughts, but in the case of Love Connection, I could be persuaded fate exists, at least for romance. Love Connection is a Sliding Doors-esque sort of a book, with us seeing how Gemma's life will work out, with each of the initial choices she could make. She has the option of attending to weddings, one is her best friends in which she is due to be made of honour. The other on the same day is of her ex-boyfriend, who she hasn't spoken to in 3 years, but Gemma has realised that she loves. She isn't invited to the other wedding, but is seriously contemplating crashing it and trying to get him back. The chapters alternate between what happens when Gemma goes to her best friend, and what happens in the circumstance where she goes to her ex. What striked me quite early into the book were the unnerving parallels in both of the stories, without being overly repetitive. Normally I would expect two versions of the same story in alternating chapters to be confusing but I had no problem at all in following the action in this, and I loved getting to know the characters, and also seeing just how Amelia (Gemma's best friend) fits into both stories and her own romantic life too. Love Connection has been cleverly engineered, and I just loved how the stories weaved around each other. It is a easy to read and follow book, where the time line moves forward in quite large chunks, between some sections, but it is always noted, and all you are really missing out on is minute details of their lives, whereas the focus in this book is on the bigger picture things, and just what sorts of consequences your actions can have. This is quite a sweet romance, that is a pleasure to read, and although I found myself willing the characters to a particular ending, there was no guarantee that I would get my wish, and I enjoyed the journey to that point. Thank you so much to Camilla for this copy of the book which I reviewed honestly and voluntarily."}, {"userName": "Adele", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15942728-adele", "userReview": "I adored this romance from Camilla Isley. It was very clever story telling; one woman with two options, which would you choose?Gemma is at the airport waiting to board one of two flights. She has two tickets: one to San Francisco and one to Chicago. Two weddings on the same day; one Gemma has been invited to, the other she hasn\u2019t! If Gemma chose San Francisco she\u2019d be gate crashing her ex\u2019s wedding and declaring her love for Jake. Gemma hasn\u2019t stopped loving Jake since they split up 3 years ago. He was her childhood sweetheart and first love and they have a special bond that with lack of communication went wrong. If Gemma chose Chicago she\u2019d be Maid of Honour for her best friend Amelia\u2019s wedding. Gemma can\u2019t decide on the two options; does she follow her heart or her head?The story then cleverly continues with the two scenarios running parallel in time with each other. We follow Gemma and her heart going to San Francisco, then on the flipside we head to Chicago with a broken hearted Gemma knowing she has lost Jake forever. Each parallel storyline doesn\u2019t go without a hitch and obstacles a plenty crop up with fun consequences. Gemma also has some lovely tender moments rekindling romance with the love of her life after a 3 year gap and also has moments learning to love again following her heartache.This was a cute, clever, fun, sexy, romantic read with these two parallel stories and I couldn\u2019t work out how the story was going to end.

It had great ratings, was catalogued as a chick lit, and sounded interesting. It ended up being the kind of book that warmed my stomach and almost made me bite my nails (I've never done this before, so you tell me what that means).The gist: at the very beginning, I was a bit confused as to what exactly I was reading. After the first few pages, I seemed to be repeating chapter one (I even returned to page 1, wondering if there was something wrong with the book). It's all part of how this book is structured. Gemma, our main character, has the choice to go to one of two weddings: a) her best friend's wedding (where she is the maid of honour); b) crashing the love of her life's wedding (as she'll regret it if she doesn't tell the ex she's always loved how stupid she was and how she can't leave without him).The structure of the book is then revealed: you get to see what happens when Gemma takes option a) and what happens when she takes option b). I can tell you this: one of them is inspiring and giddy-inducing and lovely and the other one is pull your hair out frustrating. I'll spare you further details, as I refuse to spoil the book. It's fair to say then, that 50% of the book is light and 50% wants to make you cry and wonder 'why'? (or actually 'WHYYYYYYYYYY' is more accurate). I can say though, in all fairness, that I did enjoy the book and was hooked by it. This is somewhat surprising as I never thought I'd be cheering for the 'wedding crashing' scenario in any way (I HATED 'My Best Friend's Wedding' and the fact that anyone would want to spoil anyone else's happiness for their own selfish reasons). This book, though, makes it work (and it makes it work very well). ==== Spoilers ahead ==== Be warned =======Story a), where Gemma decides to crash Amelia's wedding to stop her from marrying a cheating, lying bastard is INCREDIBLY frustrating. She chooses her friend over crashing Jake's wedding and I applaud her for it. Nonetheless, it was so heartbreaking for her to 'lose' Jake and it was awful for me to see her trying to make a life with someone else, while she's clearly in love with Jake. I hated Amelia in this story. I don't think she was a supportive best friend, instead trying to push her opinions on Gemma. Story b), where Gemma crashes Jake's wedding and he returns her feelings is very sweet. The funny thing here is that I don't think I would have enjoyed this story as much if I hadn't been reading the parallel misery that was story a). So it worked fantastically.My favourite part, of course, was both Gemmas (story a) and b)) visiting the Tarot reader. It's the one moment where the author spoils that both worlds are connected. The reading demonstrates that, despite the initial choice, the destination is the same one. I'm a total sap and I kinda saw story a)'s resolution coming from a mile (at least, I HOPED what ended up happening would happen) - and the ending proves that whether choice a) or b) was made, Jake and Gemma were truly soulmates and they were going to end up together either way. Aw. Kill me. I loved this. I'm a total wuss for 'love' and the fact that love is meant to be, regardless the parallel universes. It hits home because I'm a writer and I so totally believe in this. Love, true love, the kind that joins us with a red thread to our significant other, transcends time and space and I totally bought into the ending. Is this book perfect? Not by a long run. I can easily throw Gemma under the bus for being plain stupid, but... you know what? It's human nature and, ultimately, I can't blame her for acting one way or the other, so I'm good with this book and I'm good with recommending it too."}, {"userName": "Kaisha (The Writing Garnet)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40776578-kaisha-the-writing-garnet", "userReview": "All reviews can be found on my blog at https://thewritinggarnet.wordpress.comI am rather ashamed at the length of time it has taken me to get round to reviewing this novel! Camilla Isley is the type of author who manages to find a way to connect with her readers, pretty much straight away. As a fan of her previous novels, I crossed my fingers and prayed to Cookie Monster (what?!)\u00a0that this novel wouldn\u2019t disappoint.Two big decisions;\u00a0Gemma\u2019s chance at happiness or her best friend\u2019s? Two uncertain outcomes, but one giant leap of faith. Or is it? Gemma has a huge decision to make. A decision which is either going to make or break her AND her friendships, but which one is the right way to go? Unfortunately for Gemma, she won\u2019t know until she chooses. But, luckily for us, we get to see her live out both scenarios. However, if you think it\u2019s going to a plain sailing, predictable \u2018love connection\u2019, then you\u2019re wrong. \u2018Tinder\u2019 has nothing on Camilla Isley and her infamous \u2018Love Connection\u2019, trust me.As soon as the book begins, we are graced with Gemma\u2019s presence and THAT decision. Er, my sofa made pals with my backside, seeing as I wasn\u2019t going to move until I knew everything (aka The End). In real life we actually have to make a decision and stick with the one, we don\u2019t have the luxury of being able to dabble like that. It would save so much hassle if we could though, especially with relationships\u2026.and choosing a pair of shoes. Two of THE biggest decisions, obviously.Just when I thought this book could not get any better, I think I peed a little in excitement when I saw Ally Mcbeal & Grey\u2019s Anatomy mentioned! It was as though the book was made for me, I LOVE those sitcoms! I thought that was such a fab touch as a lot of females will relate to those sitcoms, especially when it comes to relationships.The storyline flowed absolutely brilliantly, even with the cringey \u2018oh she didn\u2019t!\u2019, moments! Camilla\u2019s trademark humour is back with a bang in \u2018Love Connection\u2019, generously sharing her fantastic, dry humour with her characters. Gemma is the ballsy character who everyone will wish for as a best friend; she\u2019s loyal, generous and extremely kick ass, definitely my favourite character.You just cannot fault Camilla Isley\u2019s memorable writing skills, nor her relaxed (yet relatable) way of keeping the reader entertained the entire way through. Despite that, she has even managed to add a hint of seriousness to the storyline as she highlights the importance of making decisions that are right for YOU, and nobody else. Under all of the humour and sass, there is a message which needs to be listened to; you just need to find it and believe it. Be true.Yet another brilliant, fun, sassy novel from rom com writer, Camilla Isley. A joy to read from the first page, to the last page; apart from when it said \u2018The End\u2019. Now THAT I didn\u2019t like!Thank you Camilla!"}], "description": "Have you ever wondered what might have been?Gemma Dawson is at the airport, staring at two plane tickets to two different cities.
