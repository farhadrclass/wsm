She lives with her precocious only child Bee Timby*, who attends Galer Street School (now located in a sprawling mansion on a hill...), her loyal but dopey hound Ice Cream Yo-Yo, and her loving but distracted husband Elgin Joe. She\u2019s tormented by annoying Galer Street parents and tech yuppies working for Microsoft Amazon. Sound familiar?OK to be fair, that\u2019s where the similarities end. The plot follows Eleanor over the course of one day trying to navigate, well, life. Timby has been sent home from Galer Street after faking a tummy bug and she discovers that Joe has told his colleagues he\u2019ll be taking a week off from work even though he\u2019s told her he\u2019d be at work. Hilarity ensues.My main disappointment with this book wasn\u2019t how similar it was to WDYGB; after all, if it ain\u2019t broke don\u2019t fix it. It had the same fast pace and dry wit, the problem was that it felt hurried and slapdash. There were a few plot points that remained unresolved and I thought some of the characters weren\u2019t given time to breathe properly. If I had to describe it in a word it would be flimsy. It\u2019s definitely not a terrible book and would make a nice beach read, but I sense that a few WDYGB fans might be disappointed. *\u201dWhen I was pregnant, we learned it was going to be a boy. Joe and I ecstatically volleyed names back and forth. One day I texted TIMOTHY which autocorrected to TIMBY.

So, you may enjoy these novels more than I did.I will share what I had liked about \"Today Will Be Different\" before I got frustrated. I liked that Semple was writing about the anxiety of modern life, and also the pressure some of us feel to constantly work on improving ourselves. Her opening paragraph is especially sharp:Today will be different. Today I will be present. Today, anyone I speak to, I will look them in the eye and listen deeply. Today I'll play a board game with Timby. I'll initiate sex with Joe. Today I will take pride in my appearance. I'll shower, get dressed in proper clothes, and change into yoga clothes only for yoga, which today I will actually attend. Today I won't swear. I won't talk about money. Today there will be an ease about me. My face will be relaxed, its resting place a smile. Today I will radiate calm. Kindness and self-control will abound. Today I will buy local. Today I will be my best self, the person I'm capable of being. Today will be different.After that good beginning, we meet our messy heroine, Eleanor Flood, on what turns into a very hectic day. While out running errands, Eleanor discovers that her husband has been taking a vacation from work and not telling her. After learning this, Eleanor becomes more anxious. She's an illustrator who is behind on her work, and at lunch she meets a former colleague who is now wildly successful, which makes her even more self-critical and frantic. Eleanor's behavior became so manic that I just couldn't take it and had to quit reading. Maybe you will finish the story and love it.Good Quotes\"Every book has to invent itself.\"\"I don't mean to ruin the ending for you, sweet child, but life is one long headwind. To make any kind of impact requires self-will bordering on madness. The world will be hostile, it will be suspicious of your intent, it will misinterpret you, it will inject you with doubt, it will flatter you into self-sabotage ... But you have a vision. You put a frame around it. You sign your name anyway. That's the risk. That's the leap.\""}, {"userName": "Rebecca Foster", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5875398-rebecca-foster", "userReview": "Bernadette fans, prepare for disappointment. There\u2019s nothing that bad about the story of middle-aged animator Eleanor Flood, her hand-surgeon-to-the-stars husband Joe, and their precocious kid Timby, but nor is there anything very interesting about it. The novel is one of those rare ones that take place all in one day, a setup that enticed me, but all Eleanor manages to fit into her day \u2013 despite the title resolution \u2013 is an encounter with a pet poet who listens to her reciting memorized verse, another with a disgruntled former employee, some pondering of her husband\u2019s strange behavior, and plenty of being downright mean to her son (as if his name wasn\u2019t punishment enough).\u201cIn the past, I\u2019d often been called crazy. But it was endearing-crazy, kooky-crazy, we\u2019re-all-a-little-crazy-crazy,\u201d Eleanor insists. I didn\u2019t think so. I didn\u2019t like being stuck in her head. She\u2019s eight years late in delivering her graphic memoir, The Flood Girls (which would have been a better title), which tells the story of the sad, neglected childhood she and her sister Ivy shared. My preferred sections were the panels from this book-within-the-book and the third-person flashbacks, especially one recounting Ivy\u2019s wedding to an aristocratic control freak from New Orleans named Bucky.In general, it seems like a bad sign if you\u2019re eager to get away from a book\u2019s narrator and her scatty behavior. This passes quickly enough \u2013 it nicely filled time on a long car journey \u2013 but is pretty unmemorable. Compared to Semple\u2019s previous novel, it feels like quirkiness for quirkiness\u2019 sake, with a sudden and contrived ending. Not one I can recommend."}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "\"Joe,\" I said. \"Do you think I'm a mean person?\"\"You're not a mean person,\" he immediately answered, and paused. \"You're a mean nice person. Big difference.\"Since I'm one of the three people on earth who has not read the author's previous work - Where'd You Go, Bernadette, I may be the ideal audience for this book. I can't compare the two, and express my disappointment that this is more of, or not enough of, the same. So, judging this one strictly on its own merits, I gotta say . . .I liked it . . . though I expect many, many will not.Your enjoyment of this book will depend solely on whether or not you like the main character Eleanor and her family. I did. Immensely. If you're not a fan of novels about very white people experiencing first world problems, you'd best move on. BUT . . . then again, Eleanor's problems are some of the concerns we all share - marriage, child rearing, relationships with parents and siblings, that nagging feeling you may have accidentally offended your poetry tutor. (Okay - that last one is probably not one we've all encountered.) This is essentially one day in the life (plus copious flashbacks), of an occasionally acerbic, frequently amusing, clever, and intelligent woman. As I said, you may not like her. I found her fascinating, and the book unpredictable. This one was most definitely for me. I honestly don't know if it will be for you."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/188447-jessica", "userReview": "I think I'm the only person in the world who thought Let It Go was kind of a bland song. (stick with me for a second, there's a point here)There was a moment in time when everyone, and not just tweens, was obsessed with that song but I always described it as a poor-man's Defying Gravity. It's Idina Menzel singing the same basic \"I can stand up for myself\" theme, but the performance is nowhere near as powerful and the actual lyrics pale in comparison. It was trying to do the same thing, but fell short of replicating the magic of original version. And that's kind of the same way that I feel about Maria Semple's latest, Today Will Be Different: it's a poor-man's Where'd You Go Bernadette?I don't know if Semple was consciously trying to write a book that mimicked Bernadette in any way, but it's definitely hard to avoid comparing the two. They're both about women feeling out of place in their environment, to the point where they reach a breaking point.Today Will Be Different follows a day in the life of Eleanor Flood, an animator who lives in Seattle with her hand-surgeon-to-the-stars husband Joe and their precocious eight-year-old son Timby. On this day, Eleanor has to go fetch Timby from school because he's faking ill to avoid a bully, she realizes her husband has told his office he's out of town but he hasn't told her that he's not going to work, she visits with her poetry tutor, and perhaps most significantly, she has a jarring encounter with a former employee that forces her to come to grips with some deeply buried personal shit. It all feels so very familiar. The difference, though, was that Bernadette had heart. It was feel-good without being overly schmaltzy. It was easy to understand why Bernadette started to crack and it was easy to root for her. Eleanor's psychology feels a little crammed in (it's awkwardly built-in, via flashback) and she's significantly less likable. She's often a jerk just for the sake of being a jerk, and that makes it really hard to care about her. Today utilizes some of the epistolary tools that worked so well last time, but it's really just a couple pieces that seemed like an afterthought - passages from Eleanor's long-delayed graphic memoir, flashbacks that switch to third-person narration, etc. The final result, to me, felt very much phoned-in. Today Will be Different is fine, but ultimately forgettable."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Today Will Be Different by Maria Semple is a 2016 Little, Brown and Company publication. I may be the only person on earth who has not read \u2018Where did you go, Bernadette?\u2019 the much acclaimed novel by Maria Semple that preceded this one. But, when this one started getting lots of promotional coverage a while back, I placed a hold on it at the library, thinking I\u2019d have plenty of time to read \u2018Bernadette\u2019 first, because the wait time was unreal. Well, I forgot about the hold, and never did read \u2018Bernadette\u2019. But, after seeing a few reviews, I thought maybe that was a good thing, and might give me a slight advantage, an opportunity to read this book without high expectations. Sadly, I didn\u2019t find this book any more appealing than many of my Goodreads peers. I don\u2019t know what I was expecting, really, but I did get the idea the book was supposed to be humorous, which it wasn\u2019t. The child, Timby, is the most charming thing about the story, but the rest of it was rather depressing, in my opinion, and didn\u2019t feel like all the issues were resolved, or at least not a enough of a resolution to satisfy me. It is certainly a unique story, very quirky, but easy to read. In fact, I read it in one afternoon. But, I was left scratching my head wondering what exactly I was supposed to have taken from the story. So, I\u2019m going to confess, I didn\u2019t get the point or the big picture, but I\u2019m intrigued by the author\u2019s style of writing, despite the disjointed plot in this book, and one day I will get around to reading \u2018Bernadette\u2019, a book I\u2019m sure I enjoy much more than I did this one. 2 stars"}, {"userName": "Eve", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1283951-eve", "userReview": "\"Today I will be my best self, the person I'm capable of being. Today will be different...\" \u2013Eleanor FloodDo you ever scroll through your friends' Instagram pictures, their Facebook family vacation albums to exotic locales, or just spend all night eating a pint (okay maybe 2) of rum raisin ice cream and scrolling through Pinterest only to feel like utter crap because your life seems so minuscule and unorganized compared to everyone else? That happens to me...a lot! It's why I have a love/hate relationship with social media, because while it can be helpful, you can spend a lot of time focusing on what you don't have instead of what you do have. It's the counter effect of contentment, which is what leads to real joy. Just stuff I'm realizing as I get older. No person has everything as together as they'd like things to appear, and that's where Eleanor Flood comes into play because I can relate to her desire to wake up and change everything about herself.She isn't the most caring, nurturing character I've come into contact with in my reading adventures, but her self-deprecating attitude doesn't belie the immense love and loyalty she has for those closest to her. I love and admire people like this, even if they are bristly and abrasive to begin with. I haven't read Where'd You Go, Bernadette, and I understand a lot of her fans were disappointed that it took a completely different turn, but think of where The Rolling Stones would be if they never changed things up a bit, or A Tribe Called Quest, for that matter, making a comeback after what seemed like eons. Anyway, I really enjoyed this book. I laughed A LOT, and it was mostly due to Semple's sarcastic wit and the narrator of the audio book, who had a slew of accents, even that of Eleanor's son, which I found the most hilarious. Great, fun read! I managed to not screw up these chocolate chip cookies while listening. Eleanor bolstered me up.

The very next page says \"THE TRICK\" hm? TRICK? Already I'm not sure where we are going. The next 9 pages we learn how her old ways weren't working....things she felt irritable about, and lots of bitching about a woman named Sydney Madsen--a friend she hasn't been able to shake for ten years. We also learn her husband is named Joe. They moved from New York to Seattle 10 years ago. Her husband is a hand surgeon, and they have a son name Timby. ( very cute the way he gets his name: a standoutMoving right along... I'm still wondering if the narrator has a NAME. Well??? A reader wonders. We meet new characters-( THEY HAVE NAMES) ... then comes \"Shunk Hour\", a poem? I was't 100% sure as it was marked over with corrections.Silly me --I was supposed to know through osmosis-what everything was. We learned that the narrator's father was an alcoholic. She says,\"One thing that happens when you have an alcoholic for a parent is you grow up the child of an alcoholic\". She goes on for quite a while to let us know that no matter what accomplishments a child makes, the single most determining factor of the child's personality, is that their parent was an alcoholic. I wasn't yet half way into this book-- but about 50 pages into it --WHILE HOME NURSING A SORE THROAT- THROBBING HEAD ACHE .. and overall yucky-sickies--- I realized I'm not laughing very much. ( a book I picked for happy healing) ha! A few chuckles-- \"Seahawks. Seahawks, Seahawks, Pope, Pope, Pope. A lady was setting out food for crows and her neighbors were pissed. Any of these could have driven Joe to despair. Or none.\"  \"What a royal frustration!\" Yep......\"Royal Frustration\"...was how I was feeling so far. HOPE...is on its way... the BOOK CAN ONLY IMPROVE!NEXT SECTION: \"THE FLOOD GIRLS\" Followed by ........ ta-da: our narrator has a name! FINALLY!!! \"Eleanor Flood\" ---We not only get more background information about Eleanor, but we get colored pictures. Photos of her with teddy bears, and dogs, and the family doing dishes. For a special treat we get a map of her neighborhood.I must be honest..... I did start laughing during this part, ( during photo show and tell), but remember I'm sick, and I'm hoping to laugh. I'm afraid I'm laughing 'at' this book more than authentically 'with' it....at this point. NEXT SECTION: CRACKED ACTOR In this section my heart opened more. We learn Eleanor has a sister....many mixed emotions about their discord. It's sad.... tender with guilty feelings -it's all very complicated. NEXT SECTION: TROUBLED TROUBADOUR  The storytelling continues to feel more genuine. Things are making sense - of her life as an animator of the cartoon \"Looper Wash\", of her chaotic personality, her vulnerability, her hostility, her usage of sarcasm, her shame, and her desire to \"Be different\". NEXT SECTION: BLUR  I started to feel really sad --- yet felt a shift coming NEXT SECTION: THE PLAN Bittersweet NEXT SECTION: THE ART OF LOSING  Very moving......I felt the sensation of teary-ness. .....and feelings of love ----regardless of what got solved and what didn't. 3.5. It would have been easy to give up on this book after about the first 25% ....but then.. we begin to see insights -- so --- I didn't like it all -- but by the end...I was actually feeling a range of emotions.

On second thought, don\u2019t forget about it. There are certain similarities: the Seattle setting, the razor-sharp wisecracks, the punchy humor, the precocious child and the mother who is barely holding onto her sanity, the poignancy of the message, even old documents as a devise to uncover a troubled past.Yes, Maria Semple has gone back to the well in her new novel. Yet the book is so darn enjoyable that it\u2019s hard not to fall in love with it. From the very first page, I was hooked \u2013 and remained so every step of the way.Eleanor Flood is the renowned animator of a popular cartoon called Looper Wash \u2013 a New York transplant in Seattle, where she lives with her husband (a hand surgeon for the Seahawks) and her wise-beyond-his-years third-grade son Timby (his name might have been Timothy, but the iPhone autocorrected it). She is also the survivor of a chaotic childhood (actress mother who died early and alcoholic father) and a sometime-student of poetry.She is also an adherent of this philosophy: \u201cThe world will be hostile, it will be suspicious of your intent, it will flatter you into self-sabotage\u2026What the world is, more than anything? It\u2019s indifferent.\u201d Yet Eleanor, despite herself, fights against this indifference. And often, she holds a mirror up to our own wishes and hypocrisies.Who among us hasn\u2019t had at least one friend in our lifetime that we don\u2019t like but haven\u2019t been able to shake? Who hasn\u2019t come face to face with a cringe-worthy who is stunted in his moral growth and distances others every time he opens his mouth? Who hasn\u2019t come up against the PC police (Timby\u2019s friend \u2013 a girl! -- eviscerates him for his H&M clothing that comes from a third-world sweatshop) or worried that our brains are turning to mush? And who hasn\u2019t used \u201ctricks\u201d to conceal our insecurities and attain more admiration and love?The thing is, Maria Semple gets it \u2013 this thing called life. With the one exception of a secondary plot about husband Joe\u2019s long-held secret (rather over the top), this is a book that masters the impossible trick of being witty and achingly sincere at the same time. As an added bonus, there several pages of cartoons from Eleanor\u2019s graphic novel, The Flood Girls (transporting us into her world so we can attest to her talent). It\u2019s a book for any reader who is striven to become one\u2019s best self despite the odds. In short, it\u2019s a book for everyone.

How did so many people get it so totally wrong? This book is incredible. Maria Semple is such a strange and wonderful writer, this book is an uproarious and quirky and relatable gut-punch of sorrowful joy. Here we have the story of Eleanor Flood, a spacey but brilliant, caustic but kind, middle-aged lady. She is an illustrator in the second act of her life after having co-created a wildly successful animated show for tweens; now she lives in Seattle with her husband, who is a down-to-earth and competent and sweet hand surgeon, and their eight-year-old son Timby, who is unintentionally hilarious and weirdly perceptive (and listen, I hate reading about \"precocious\" children; this is not that). Eleanor is just trying to get through the fucking day without forgetting the right words for things or having to suffer through a lunch with an insufferable friend or leaving the dog somewhere or making her kid or her husband hate her, which is hard sometimes! Especially when your head is a constant whirl of too many thoughts and too much baggage and family secrets and thwarted ambitions and self-loathing and wry observatory brilliance.I don't feel like this summary is going well; the book sounds normal and boring when actually it's kooky and pell-mell and sharp and so funny. Like, here is a moment where Eleanor is cataloging her \"grab bag of flaws\":1. Once I ate a bagel on the toilet....3. I floss in bed....5. I take the first bite of popcorn at the movies by touching my tongue to the top of the popcorn and eating what sticks. But Joe always says he doesn't want popcorn because it's too salty, so it's mine and can't I eat it the way I want?6. I toss Milk Duds into the popcorn.7. Actually, I bite the Milk Duds into four pieces and spit them back into the popcorn so they're smaller, giving me a better popcorn-to-Milk-Dud ratio. Yes, they're covered in saliva, but it's my saliva. Though I can see how, to someone reaching into the popcorn they said they weren't going to eat, it could be an issue.HA. HAHAHA. Or! Here is Eleanor in a moment of self-recrimination while driving around with Timby, who is suddenly very nice to her in an eight-year-old way, and then:I unbuckled my seatbelt and turned around.\"What are you doing?\" Timby asked, his voice edged with alarm.I was all butt as I attempted to clamber into the backseat.\"Don't,\" Timby said, a sitting duck in his car seat.\"I need to hold you,\" I grunted, struggling to pull my foot free from between the seats.\"Please. Stop.\"\"I want to be worthy of you,\" I said, panting like childbirth.I became stuck between the console and the roof in an unsightly gargoyle crouch.\"Oh, God, look at me.\"\"I don't want to,\" Timby said.\"I don't know what I'm doing!\"\"Neither do I,\" he said. \"Go back.\"Was that funny out of context? I laughed so hard typing it that I had to stop and wipe my eyes.Look, in addition to just being wonderful, this book is very cleverly written in a bunch of chopped parts, where different people narrate (Eleanor in first-person; Eleanor in third-person; Joe in third-person), and there's also a graphic novel\u2013y insert. Plus there's a whole secret plot with other family members that I will not spoil at all, and another about the agony and ecstacy of the life of a poet-for-hire who is also a guy who gives out samples at Costco, and a totally explainable incident where Eleanor steals one of Timby's classmate's parents' keys, and a Grievance List, and a thwarted book deal or two, and hand surgery in Africa, and haughty drunken hijinks in New Orleans, and a harrowing funeral in Aspen, and on and on. I guess I have to admit there's a kind of dodgy plot twist toward the end that I wasn't 100% onboard for, but the rest of the zany, marvelous journey was well worth it.

While it is entertaining, laugh-out-loud funny it is not. There are certainly some funny parts, such as her child being named Timby because her iPhone corrected Timothy to Timby and it stuck (my iPhone is constantly correcting things I meant to type to random, bizarre words that make no sense so I could certainly relate to that). I also love the concussion app that Timby found when he was worried his mother Eleanor had a concussion \u2013 every five minutes it randomly asks a new question meant to check a person\u2019s alertness. These questions were interjected at odd and usually comical times.I found the book fairly sad and wished that some of Eleanor\u2019s issues had been resolved more, particularly one she has with a family member.

The story revolves around Eleanor who is married to Joe, a surgeon, and the mother of Timby. They live in Seattle, which Eleanor doesn't seem to like all that much - in fact, she doesn't seem to like anything much. That is where the problem arose for me. In a way, the style of this book, even the plot is not very different from Where'd You Go Bernadette, but in the latter, I cared about the characters, and their moodiness felt understandable. I could sympathize with the sad points as well as laugh at the funny ones. In this book, however, the main character is just plain unlikeable. That would be okay, not five stars probably, but I can get something out of even such a book. Unfortunately, I found the plot very slow and uneventful, and the revelation that could have rounded out Eleanor's character came much too late for me to care a whole lot. That being said, Semple's writing and observations are clever and well-done. I am definitely not giving up on this author, I was just a little underwhelmed. Then again, I wonder whether I would have felt the same had I read this book before Bernadette (or would I not have felt compelled to read Bernadette at all then?)Anyway . . . not a bad book, but sadly not what I was hoping for either.

You were so good and I didn't appreciate you enough. I wanted this book by the same author to compare and here I am disappointed. Not because it's necessarily a bad book - not at all - but because I held my hopes entirely too high. Today Will Be Different starts out well. It's funny, endearing, totally real, and charming in a quirky way - everything good in a saturday morning read. But as the pages flipped on, I found myself more and more lost, wondering \"what really is the point here?\" Which, as I write that I'm thinking...maybe THAT'S the point. So, you see, it's convoluted. I didn't dislike this story. It's about a woman who's life has been so caught up in her work, her relationships, her being a mother, that she's lost grasp on other areas of her life. It's understandable and relatable in a way we don't always want to admit - but we've all been there and thus feel a certain kinship to the characters. Where it lost me was the timeline. Holy geez was it all over the place. Sometimes I'd start a chapter only to halfway through realize this wasn't a flashback after all. Time to start over and gain new insight, I guess. What did I think?: Just because I wasn't a huge fan doesn't mean it's not perfectly enjoyable. It's being adapted for an HBO show after all, so it's packed with charm. It just didn't resonate with me at the time. Who should read it? Anyone that likes books that are light, quirky, and feel slightly disjointed but together enough to make sense in the end. If you're looking for the next Where'd You Go, Bernadette....eh, I'd still probably say give this a chance.

I haven't gossiped, haven't lost my temper, haven't been greedy, grumpy, nasty, selfish or overindulgent. I'm very happy about this. But in a few minutes, Lord, I'm going to get out of bed. And from then on, I'm going to need a lot more help.--My Morning Mantra Eleanor, the heroine of this little tale, starts out her day on a similar note vowing that today will be different and while it is, it definitely doesn\u2019t go the way she planned. It\u2019s a madcap adventure of a day that often results in screwball comedy, yet the phrase that keeps rolling around as I try to sum up my thoughts is, I lost the plot. It\u2019s an oft used British phrase describing when one has lost the ability to understand or cope with what is happening, except in this case, it is both literal AND metaphorical.There is a framework of a plot, but in structure and voice, elements seemed incompatible and the feeling of disjointedness made for a somewhat bewildering read. The narrative voice of our heroine is snarky, the best part for me, also slightly neurotic, which I can also relate to, but rather uncongenial as well, which is much harder to endure. But the thorny part is that the voice jumps from first person to third person narration for the main event and then back again which lends to this feeling of confusion.My favorite parts involved Timby, Eleanor\u2019s wise beyond his years child and sidekick throughout this wacky day. He is both clever and innocent dolling out commentary and coping mechanisms like a school age guru. There is a running joke with a concussion app that made me laugh out loud. And while the third person narration of the events that led to a family fissure was disconcerting, the story telling in this section was still absorbing. All in all, when this book is good, it\u2019s quite good. When it\u2019s not, it leaves you pining for what made the previous parts so endearing. I can\u2019t recommend or dissuade on this one, for fans of Bernadette (like me), it\u2019s worth it for the moments of comedic brilliance and the hope that maybe tomorrow will be different and Maria Semple will find a way to give us more of the good parts."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "A number of things typically factor in on how much we like / love or dislike / intensely dislike a book; if we\u2019re brokenhearted about a personal event, losing someone dear to us, or if we\u2019re busy and easily distracted, worrying about outside factors, if it\u2019s too hot or too cold or we don\u2019t feel well. And then sometimes we read a book by an author we\u2019ve read before and our expectations are high based on our affections for a former book we enjoyed. It\u2019s been a while since I received a copy of Maria Semple\u2019s \u201cToday Will Be Different\u201d, a gift from my brother who sends me books every year now. He\u2019d also sent me her previous novel \u201cWhere\u2019d You Go, Bernadette\u201d which I\u2019d enjoyed immensely a few years ago. It wasn\u2019t an ohmygosh had to tell all my friends about it, but rather a surprise. A testament to the fact that the right kind of book at the right time can be surprisingly good. I did not have the same experience with the story of Eleanor Flood, her husband Joe and their son Timby. Timby, so named when the autocorrect on her phone changed Timothy, the decided upon name, to Timby. She couldn\u2019t resist this hand of \u201cfate\u201d and so they named their son Timby. Husband Joe is a world-famous hand surgeon, called upon frequently as the best in the business to operate on hands holding on tightly to their rich and famous lifestyles. Eleanor is an animator, one who is supposed to be working on a book for which she has received an advance eight years ago, but she hasn\u2019t worked on it in ages, if ever. Timby is a precocious kid who should be in school, but seems to prefer hanging out with his mom and driving her to the point of distraction (the job of most kids) where she hands him her purse and flees, leaving him with a man she barely knows.The tone of the narration, in general, is a bit on the sarcastically snappish, the story wanders back and forth through time, missing her sister who is no longer in her life, a dictate, more or less, from the brother-in-law who wants them out of the picture, then back to her husband Joe, or Timby or something else, someone else. Following Eleanor\u2019s somewhat neurotic thoughts through one day was exhausting, and I began wondering if somewhere I missed where the plot went off course, or if I\u2019d somehow skipped some essential pieces. \u201dBecause the other way wasn\u2019t working. The waking up just to get the day over with until it was time for bed. The grinding it out was a disgrace, an affront to the honor and long shot of being alive at all. The ghost-walking, the short-tempered distraction, the hurried fog. (All of this I\u2019m just assuming, because I have no idea how I come across, my consciousness is that underground, like a toad in winter.) The leaving the world a worse place just by being in it. The blindness to the destruction in my wake.\u201dWhat I enjoyed: Timby. He\u2019s charming and funny in the way that only a child can be, still innocent and trusting, but also precociously clever. There\u2019s a scene with a concussion app where Timby asks her the questions every five minutes to make sure she answers each correctly or else she\u2019ll need to go to the hospital \u2013 it\u2019s sweetly amusing. \u201dThat was happiness. Not the framed greatest hits, but the moments between.\u201dThis one day, where she reminisces back over years, projects about future years and tries to remain present with her son tagging along while she tries to figure out where her husband has gone, and maybe with whom, has faults, but isn\u2019t without some appeal.\u201dIf underneath anger was fear, then underneath fear was love. Everything came down to the terror of losing what you love.\u201dThere are plenty of moments in this novel which are charming, sweet, amusing, and there are some that don\u2019t live up to those moments.

Today won't be different. No day will be different for the selfishly privileged people trapped in the individualism and consumerist blindness within the pages of this book. That's harsh considering I was given the book for free from giveaways (for which I am grateful-ish and which made me give it one more star than I feel like). Because of this, and because m own writing was recently criticised harshly I had planned to be positive but the book didn't give me much to work with there.Firstly a couple of things that are probably not the author's fault. Firstly, it is not a suitable book to be marketed away from home. It is very closetted in a narrow world-view that belongs in Seattle and is not relatable anywhere else as far as I know (definitely not in Australia). I would overlook this given I was mailed the book free (a kindness on one level) except that I went to a bookshop this week and this book was being heavily pushed there. So given the target-market this is something the editor or author probably should have addressed (as authors from here get asked to modify things for your market). Because of this I am not sure if things in the book are factually wrong (people who are \"nearly fifty\" having been abused by nuns in a catholic school...what did Vatican II happen a generation later in America or is this an anachronism?)The second thing is the way this \"Bernadette\" book is promoted on the cover (both sides) it appears the author had a tremendous success with a previous book and this book is attempting to coast in on the wake of that success. I can't blame her then for the superior tone of \"everything I write will automatically be gold\" because I think success gets us all that way and authors are only human. But this is something the editor/s should have picked up on. The self-satisfied tone is one thing, but the sloppiness is another. At first I thought it was deliberate, the voice of a dysfunctional person but there were nonsensical POV shifts (POV shifts are not bad in themselves but need to be managed better and make sense in the context of the book) and the main narrators border-line hysteria and untrustworthiness made it a difficult ride. At first I thought the heteronormative world view (women need husbands and are fulfilled and defined by them) and the \"love you no matter what\" (control freak Joe who claims he pays \"for all this circus\" gets portrayed as somehow good and desirable) was one of the \"problems\" of the narrative, along with the superficiality, lack of relationship and consumer driven capitalist lifestyle of Eleanor and her dysfunctional family. Nope.Then I figured maybe it was a book about mental illness, post-traumatic stress and even though how wealthy this family was made them essentially unrelatable maybe I ould redeem something from that.Nope again.The microaggressions started, making fun of inclusivity and gender-queerness in a way that was almost insightful, but ultimately mocking. The \"asshole\" classist, racist, misogynist who was nevertheless so well liked...and the uncritical acceptance that all his servants are black and that he employs black musicians who have to play OUTSIDE (oh the symbolic violence) and that is accepted with a shrug of \"it takes all kinds\"...ironic given the anti-diversity rant later on pp219-220. But you know all of that classist and passively racist stuff is part of consumerism (as is Timby's gender identity) which makes them ok. Because divergence is fine so long as it is about individualism, but not if there is actual politics involved (see pp219-220 again as well as the ending).The ending is unsatisfactory because something that could be life-changing and \"radical\" gets the \"Radical\" label while essentially being yet another individualist lifestyle \"choice\" for consumers to use as a way of avoiding real self-reflection and depth. What is the life of this family really for? For \"meaning\" that they can feel within themselves. Early on in the book Eleanor reflects that Joe is decent and respectable and exactly what the Catholic church tried to make him. Maybe different countries have different Catholic churches, but in most of the world the Catholic church (for all it's flaws at the institutional level) is a church of the working-class, of grass-roots activism and dogged commitment to social justice. Comfortable middle-class respectability is the hallmark of many Christian churches but not really something Catholics could claim even if they wanted to.Joe's rational hatred of religion is over the top and the \"feel good\" stuff about religion in the book equally misses the point. In this way religion is (uncritically, in fact approvingly) reduced again to what Marx called \"the opium of the masses\". Despite being wealthier than most of the world I think Eleanor, Joe and Timby are \"the masses\" they seem to exist only to consume and to \"feel good\".I am honestly sorry I couldn't like better than this a book about an adult survivor of a parent's alcoholism. It is interesting to me that Eleanor's mourning in the book is for lost relationships with her mother and sister and yet she does not relate to any female character (Joe \"my man\" p253, Timby, Alonzo, Spencer). There is Sydney of course but Eleanor hates and scorns her (perhaps with reason). There are the chorus of mothers and feminised father/s that she also fails to relate to. I find this hard to believe. Surely she would gravitate toward relationships with women?But no, because she \"bought\" a man, a good man. p268 and he \"pays\" for her and the entire circus. We have entered here a hell of white picket fences and individualised conformity. And I just wish any part of the book seemed even a little bit aware of how fucked up that is! But the snideness like \"the trick\" is turned outward, a way of manufacturing our consent to the mind-prison by recruiting us to help gild the bars."}, {"userName": "Rebbie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6582211-rebbie", "userReview": "2 1/2 starsThe book is told from the pov of a woman named Eleanor Flood who has an emotionally unhealthy sense of being and a chaotic life. She vows to try harder to make her life better, and be there for her husband and son. On the very day she sets out to do this, her present merges with her past and forces her to confront some of her painful issues.A couple important things to note: 1. This is listed as a comedy and it shouldn't be. Eleanor Flood is cut from the same cloth as the protagonist (Bernadette) in Maria Semple's last book. So yes, technically she's trying to be funny, but imo she keeps missing her mark. It feels forced and disengenuous, as if it was meant to piggyback on the formulaic success of the previous novel, like a sure bet. The problem is that it was a losing gamble, which brings me to number 2.2. The book is disjointed, to the point of distraction and a little confusion. I get it: it's supposed to be that way on purpose, like we're inside Eleanor's head. But the problem is that you have to be in the mood for this type of awkward roller coaster, or you will be asking yourself what the heck is going on and why should you even care. The bottom line is that Eleanor reminds me of someone who is bipolar or has borderline personality disorder, and that doesn't make for an enjoyable read with a plot like this. She's a mere shadow in the face of the full character of Bernadette in Maria Semple's previous novel. It seems unfair to compare the two characters, but the truth is that it's unavoidable since Eleanor was created to be Bernadette 2.0.

It was pure pleasure for me. Some have complained that the main character Eleanor was mean, but I found her to be merely snarky, often justifiably so. The author's often painfully insightful reflections on the publishing industry rang true. (While Eleanor was busy ignoring her book, her editor became a cheese saleswoman and her agent a New Age homeopath...yes, recent years have proven some rough times for the book business). Also cringe-worthy but brutally reflective of real life is Eleanor's encounter with a former coworker, once a real underachiever, now turned famous artist. So many things life seems to dole out, but fairness is rarely one of them. Then there's her poet/instructor who's forced to work at Costco, pushing seafood \"steaks\" on unwitting customers.These insights are filled out with the current day's dilemmas -- a child faking illness due to bullying and a missing husband -- as well as with the larger issues of what happened in Eleanor's childhood and in particular, her estrangement from her sister. All of this is accompanied by a wonderfully funny take on life and its mishaps.This is one of those books that's easy to read and over before you notice, leaving you wanting more of Semple's great writing.Thanks to Little, Brown and Good Reads for allowing me to read the advanced reader's copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Caro M.", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7951847-caro-m", "userReview": "This book = first world problems + rich people problems + quirky-quirkiness + crazy-craziness + 1% o'Jesus.

Eleanor knows she's a mess. But today, she will tackle the little things. She will shower and get dressed. She will have her poetry and yoga lessons after dropping off her son, Timby. She won't swear. She will initiate sex with her husband, Joe. But before she can put her modest plan into action-life happens. Today, it turns out, is the day Timby has decided to fake sick to weasel his way into his mother's company. It's also the day Joe has chosen to tell his office-but not Eleanor-that he's on vacation. Just when it seems like things can't go more awry, an encounter with a former colleague produces a graphic memoir whose dramatic tale threatens to reveal a buried family secret. TODAY WILL BE DIFFERENT is a hilarious, heart-filled story about reinvention, sisterhood, and how sometimes it takes facing up to our former selves to truly begin living.", "title": "Today Will Be Different", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28449270-today-will-be-different", "average": 3.19, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1491367278l/28449270.jpg", "reviews": 5769, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1588088.Maria_Semple", "name": "Maria Semple"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Humor", "Contemporary", "Adult Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28449270-today-will-be-different", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30187391-today-will-be-different", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32498093-today-will-be-different", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34378386-today-will-be-different", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28448932-today-will-be-different", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13526165-where-d-you-go-bernadette", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3730554-this-one-is-mine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39991639-hoje-vai-ser-diferente", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27297737-magnify-your-business", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13106726-new-voices", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
