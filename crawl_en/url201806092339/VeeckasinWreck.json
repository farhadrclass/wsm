As popular with readers as it was reviled by baseball executives, the book climbed best seller lists in the summer of 1962 and has never faded from sight. In 2002, it claimed a place on Sports Illustrated\u2019s list of the Top 100 Sports Books of All Time, ranking 33rd.Veeck\u2014as in Wreck is still as entertaining today as it was in the \u201860s, though time has tempered some of the harsh criticisms of the baseball establishment. Biographer Paul Dickson, in his forthcoming release Bill Veeck: Baseball\u2019s Greatest Maverick, notes sportswriter Red Smith described it upon its release as \u201c380 pages of aggravated assault.\u201d Many observers felt Veeck had gone overboard in pummeling Commissioner Ford Frick, with whom Veeck rarely saw eye to eye.But Veeck had sufficient reason to take the offensive, having basically been run out of the game in the mid \u201850s after trying to relocate his St. Louis Browns to a city that would support them. As Dickson notes in his Prologue, \u201che spent a lifetime challenging baseball\u2019s staid establishment, cultivating enemies the way others cultivate friends.\u201d Simply put, the other owners resented his showman\u2019s approach to running his clubs, and it got very personal.So when it came time for Veeck to record his life (or at least the first five decades, he lived until 1986), he exacted his revenge, taking his side of his skirmishes with Frick, Yankees general manager George Weiss, Yankees co-owner Del Webb\u2014honestly, just about every significant figure in baseball\u2014public.Veeck\u2019s career, of course, was about much more than political infighting. Though he acknowledges in the first chapter that he\u2019ll forever be known as the man who sent a midget to bat, the significance of that stunt often overshadows what Veeck sought to achieve by signing Eddie Gaedel to a one-game contract. It was all about making the game fun to draw fans to the park, and nobody was better at it than Veeck. But there was much more to it than gimmicks. Veeck built winners in Cleveland and Chicago, capturing a World Series title in 1948, just his second full year at the helm of the Indians.He recognized what most of his fellow owners would not publicly acknowledge in the 1940s: the Negro Leagues were brimming with talent that could help his major league club. Veeck sought to purchase the Philadelphia Phillies in 1942 and stock the roster with Negro League stars. Frick and then-Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis squelched the deal, and baseball waited five more years until Jackie Robinson broke the color line. Veeck integrated the American League a couple months later, signing Larry Doby for the Indians. In 1948, he was denounced for signing an aging Satchel Paige, though Veeck had the last laugh when Paige went 6-1 with a 2.48 ERA in 72.2 valuable innings as a swingman, helping spur the Tribe to the pennant.Out of baseball at the time he and Ed Linn collaborated on the book due to health problems, Veeck ended the book with a bit of showy foreshadowing. \u201cSometime, somewhere, there will be a club no one really wants. And then Ole Will will come wandering along to laugh some more. Look for me under the arc-lights, boys. I\u2019ll be back.\u201dIt took more than another decade, but he eventually did return to the game, buying back the White Sox in 1975. While his reputation among the old establishment was forever tarnished, the younger generation appreciated his approach as an apostle for baseball, drawing new fans by the tens of thousands in every city in which he operated. In 1991, five years too late for him to enjoy it, Veeck was voted into the Baseball Hall of Fame by the Veterans Committee. While many of his critics have fallen along the dusty road of time, Veeck\u2014and his reputation\u2014have only improved with age."}, {"userName": "Scott", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/580475-scott", "userReview": "\"All I was saying was that a losing team, plus bread and circuses, was better than a losing team and a long, still silence.\"Thank Bill Veeck for floppy hat night and bobblehead giveaways at the ballpark.

Veeck is my kind of guy, I think. But I don't love his book. It's too much of a \"getting even\" bio. Veeck is telling his story to settle up some old scores, more than he is to teach me things that I would enjoy learning. It's about him and not his readers. Oh well. That's business biography in our era (which started in the 60s when Veeck penned this book).Still, his unique role in baseball's American League during the 40s, 50s, 60s and 70s make a pretty good story. So, I can't tell you not to read it.

(This is likely colored by his many accounts of enjoying nightlife.)I was born 25 years after the most recent events in the book, so most of the names held little meaning for me, but Veeck's an entertaining enough storyteller that it didn't matter all too much. What surprised me the most was how many of his arguments could have been pulled from a post on Deadspin--rants in favor of showmanship by players, or decrying the faults of amateurism.

Veeck was one of the true characters of the game of baseball. Veeck got his start in baseball due to the fact his father worked for the Wrigley's in the Chicago Cubs organization. After the death of his father, Veeck stayed on and worked for the Cubs. From there he went on to own the Milwaukee Brewers (the just a minor league baseball team), the Clevelend Indians, the infamous St. Louise Browns, and the Chicago White Sox on two separate occasions. Although some of Veeck's contemporaries accused him of making a mockery of the game with is outlandish promotions, I think his efforts probably saved the game of baseball in some cities. Veeck approached the game as a business man with a child's perspective. He was not above manipulating the rules to his advantage. In every place that he controlled a baseball team minus St. Louis, I think it is safe to say Veeck was successful. When Veeck took over the Browns, he inherited a ball club long on debt, short on funds, and short on talent. They also were competing with the St. Louis Cardinals for fans in a city that really couldn't support two baseball teams. Veeck realized this and focused on the idea of running the Cardinals out of town. It's hard to imagine anyone thinking of running the Cardinals out of town. Veeck's idea came to a halt when Fred Saigh sold the Cardinals to Gussie Busch and Anheuser-Busch. Veeck financially could not compete and attempted to move the Browns. He had made so many enemies within the \"Old Guard\" of owners that the only way they would allow the team to move would be if Veeck sold the team first. In effect, the baseball owners wanted to get rid of Veeck and bankrupt him in the process. Obviously, it is easy to detect Veeck's bitterness in the book. He did however make a comeback years later when he purchased the Chicago White Sox and led them to the pennant in 1959. He also reaquired the White Sox in the late 70s as well. The most remarkable thing about Veeck is his love for the game. He did look at it through childlike eyes but possessed a business instinct as well. Some of the reforms that he proposed to the league in the 1940s were frowned upon by many of the league owners, particularly the god-like New York Yankees who had nothing to gain and everything to lose from the proposals. Hence the proposals \"died in committee\". These proposals only led to the further deterioration of the relationship between Veeck and the owners. Ironically, almost 70 years later, many of the proposals are standard methods of operation in Major League Baseball. Veeck spends time in the book talking about many of the characters in the game like Hal Peck, Satchel Paige, Larry Doby, Casey Stengal, Rogers Hornsby, Ford Frick, the Griffiths of Washington, the O'Malleys of Brooklyn/Los Angeles, and Tom Yawkey of Boston. In each instance it is quite evident of his opinion of each. The anecdotes that he shares either make you laugh (see Satchel Paige), angry(see Walter O'Malley), or shake your head in dismay (see Ford Frick). He also goes into great detail to explain the \"good old boys network\" that existed in Major League Baseball at the time. Veeck introduced many things to Major League Baseball: Ladies Day, the midget, the exploding scoreboard, and Disco Sucks night. Some were overwhelming successes and many were unquestionable failures. What I liked about Veeck's approach was that he wanted the fans to \"experience\" a baseball game. Yes, winning was important, but Veeck on numerous occasions realized he did not have the horses to compete, yet he still wanted fans to have an entertaining experience. I don't know if you could make the statement that \"Bill Veeck saved baseball\" but I do think it is safe to say that Veeck made it a more entertaining game."}, {"userName": "Bonnieb", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11823363-bonnieb", "userReview": "This autobiography is a good read for anyone interested in baseball history, baseball business history, the backstage happenings of the sport and some funny stories. Bill Veeck was certainly one of a kind. I actually enjoyed the first part of the book more than the rest. This was where I learned many things, including:* that Bill\u2019s dad was President of the Cubs from 1917--1933* that they won the Nat\u2019l League pennant in 1918* Bill\u2019s dad was always Mr. Veeck, was a journalist before becoming President of the Cubs, and was asked by  the new owner, Wm Wrigley Sr to take the job when he bought the Cubs in 1917.* that Wrigley Field was marketed as the \u2018beautiful Wrigley Field\u2019 and \u2018family-friendly\u2019 as early as the 1930s.  Phil Wrigley \u201cmade the park itself his best promotion\u201d.* that Veeck was 3 when his Dad took over the club, worked every part of the stadium even as a young boy,  and as his Dad died when he was 15-16, so Phil Wrigley took over about the same time.* as early as 1934 Veeck tried to get Wrigley to put lights into the stadium. No other park had lights yet.  Wrigley called it a \u2018fad, a passing fancy.\u2019 One year later the other clubs started putting lights in...and as we know, the Cubs still did not have lights when this book was first written in 1972.* the idea for the ivy-covered bleachers came from Perry Stadium in Indianapolis.* Wrigley did not believe in the farm system as it stood. felt that farm teams should be able to sell players to  ANY of the MLB teams. He subsidized Milwaukee, but let them sell to anyone. Renounced all rights to  players. one overriding flaw of Phil Wrigley: \u201cHe knows more about things and less about people than any  man I have ever met.\u201d 39* Al Capone supplied a case of champagne daily to his Dad\u2019s bedside. Prohibition had just ended; nothing was available but Veeck\u2019s dad was dying of leukemia.* Veeck owned the Cleveland Indians, ran Miami for a season, and owned the White Sox twice...the first time  winning the World Series with them.* He was run out of baseball a couple of times.* the story of the expansion to the west coast is so filled with politics, money, back room manipulating...it  makes elected politics look clean.* Del Webb...learned about him as a developer, builder, politician.* With his leg hurt as a young man, infections set in and he kept losing more and more of his leg. He liked to be called a cripple, not handicapped. As he says in the book, \u201cWebster defines a cripple as \u2018a lame or partly  disabled person.\u2019 I\u2019m not handicapped; I\u2019m crippled.\u201d 375 WEbster defines handicapped as: \u201cto place at a  disadvantage.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t believe I am. I believe I can do anything anybody else can do that doesn\u2019t involve  quick sprints, high jumps and a fast buck-and-wing. And so, far more important, although I am crippled, I  am not handicapped.\u201d* The lyrics, na na na na, hey hey hey hey, goodbye now sung in sporting venues across the country were from a song that came out in 1969 and sung by Steam...were first sung by White Sox fans in 1977 when they had  a great first half of the season before running out of steam."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2797718-kevin", "userReview": "As I noted in a status update, Veeck was fully aware that he would go down in history as the guy who sent a midget to bat. He was fine with that, but this book shows there was a lot more to the man. And it doesn't hurt that he can tell a good story.Baseball is a game that was built on big characters. They seem to be missing from the game today. Sure, some of the players can be a little wacky (e.g. Manny Ramirez), but most of the personality has left the owner's boxes. Baseball's aristocracy does nothing to prevent a Jeffrey Loria or Frank McCourt from doing his level-best to ruin a few franchises, but the Commissioner is quick to rebuke anyone who so much as hints at criticism of another owner, an umpire, or team. I doubt a guy like Veeck would even be able to get his name on the agenda of an owner's meeting today, much less be allowed to buy into the league.Veeck's personal philosophy seemed to be something along the lines of \"let's have as much fun as possible, and if we happen to make some money along the way, so much the better.\" Today, the bottom line is king. The reason teams like the Marlins, Pirates, and Royals have been so bad for so long isn't that they can't compete with the big market clubs. It's that they pocket all of the money they make. They're more interested in their return on investment than putting out a winning product or putting on a good show for the fans. Veeck understood that without the fans, there's no such thing as major league baseball. It was his solemn duty to provide as much entertainment as possible to either enhance or distract from his team.Veeck wouldn't be able to survive in today's big league system with free agency and teams serving more as pieces of an investment portfolio than modes of entertainment. I imagine he'd probably be an operator in an independent league out there somewhere though, putting together promotions and trying to get by year to year. Baseball would be better off if more owners took Veeck's approach to things. But he was also such a force of personality and will that any attempt at imitation would come across as a poor impersonation."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/109656-mark", "userReview": "Quite self-aggrandizing but it is an autobiography. Veeck is quick to remind you that about every good idea was his and every terrible idea was someone else's. He also loves to tell how the Chicago White Sox and Cleveland Indians won pennants under his ownership, but oddly doesn't mention those years with the St. Louis Browns. Forget that the White Sox were a pretty good team when he purchased them. It was also a time when apparently you can go to lunch and wind up buying a baseball team because people were always \"getting deals done.\" Also, if Satchell Paige was so effective, why was he used sparingly out of the bullpen? Through all that, this is pretty seminal reading for baseball fans. 1. Veeck was one of the last owners in MLB that was not independently wealthy. He goes into great detail about his various financial aerobics to get the millions he needed to even get a 30 or 40 percent share of a team. He also goes into detail of owners meetings including the debacle of when Veeck was unable to procure the votes needed to move the Browns to Baltimore and subsequently spent six years out of the league. 2. If nothing else, Veeck thought outside of the box, for better or worse. He supported interleague play and the dissolution of the teams' farm systems. Interestingly, he also was concerned about the time of games even though most games were not televised (or before TV) so games were left to their own volition. He recommended limiting warm-up pitches between innings and requiring only two strikes for a strikeout (and three balls for a walk). 3. Despite that vision, he also signed a \"midget\" to go to bat and gave fans signs to decide in-game strategy. 4. He also goes into detail about signing Larry Doby, who broke the color barrier in the American League in Cleveland. Although for some unexplained reason Veeck has it out for Branch Rickey. He doesn't overtly criticize Rickey but there seems to be some animosity. Veeck does criticize Rickey for not paying Jackie Robinson's team for his services. Because paying another owner for the services of a black player is by no means demeaning."}, {"userName": "Spiros", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/245237-spiros", "userReview": "Simply put, Bill Veeck was one of my all-time favorite Americans, a man who started with something and recurrently risked it all in the interest of giving people a good show. His father, William Veeck, was a Chicago journalist who was hired by William Wrigley to run the Chicago Cubs. Wiped out by the Great Depression, Veeck Sr. was unable to leave his offspring any great financial wealth, but he left his son a huge capital of goodwill in the Game, which Bill was able to draw upon over his years in baseball.\"For my part, I have wandered around a bit in baseball. Wherever I land, I make it clear to the girls at the switchboard and the guys who run the elevator that I am 'Bill'. I believe very strongly that we are all working together for the best interests of the ball club. I cannot see why the fact that I own some stock and they don't should have any bearing on our personal relationship. I do not have my father's inborn sense of dignity, and false dignity annoys me.\"Essentially, Veeck was the polar opposite of Charlie Finley: both men stood in opposition to the rest of baseball's ownership, but while Finley was given to paranoia and megalomania, Veeck was always ready to have a laugh at his own expense, as well as at the expense of the stuffed shirts in the Commissioner's Office. Finley ran the A's into the ground, while Veeck set attendance records wherever he took his operations. Veeck, writing in 1962, did have a blindspot regarding the telecast of home games, and how televising one's home games could actually help promote attendance; aside from that, he was very much on top of things."}, {"userName": "Sherrie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2755546-sherrie", "userReview": "One of the most entertaining autobiographies I have ever read. When I finished it, I felt like I had listened to Bill Veeck telling me stories at a bar more than I felt like I had read a book. Veeck was a man far, far ahead of his time in promoting baseball; things like exploding scoreboards, special \"Days\" at the ballpark, outlandish promotions, and many, many more were originated by this man. (I was sad to learn that Veeck was gone from Chicago before my personal all time favorite event, Disco Demolition Night, took place, but I'm sure he would have loved it) In an age where \"big\" and \"loud\" (and \"fan-friendly\") were not words used in connection with baseball, and a Game Day Ops Manager would have been undreamed of, Veeck thought of them all. For his efforts, he was of course not a popular man with the stuffy baseball hierarchy of the time, and the recounting of his battles takes up a great deal of the book.\"Veeck\" is of course somewhat dated, since it was written in 1952 and updated in the 60s, and tells of years before that. I remember Ladies Day at the ballpark very well, but today very few women have to adjust their stockings at the game, and most women I know have a pretty good basic understanding of baseball (possibly because their mothers were beneficiaries of Ladies' Days? It wouldn't surprise me) so that particular event has fallen by the wayside. But for anyone interested in the evolution of baseball to where it is today, this book is a must read."}, {"userName": "Randal", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14421553-randal", "userReview": "Mad Men meets the Bronx Zoo ...If all you know about Bill Veeck is that he's the guy who sent a midget up to bat in the majors, the first chapter is for you. It's also the best story in the book, although there are many, many good anecdotes. The book starts to lose steam about halfway, when it gets more into the back-room politics of who got what franchise and why, although it was undoubtedly a powderkeg when it was published and the people Veeck trashes were alive (or their children even ... it really trails off after about 1969).It will confirm any belief you may have that the sport is run by a bunch of selfish, stupid old men, and has been for approximately forever.When I was about 50 pages in, I had to doublecheck that there was a ghostwriter (Ed Linn, who has several sports bios to his name). It comes across in the sort of inelegant, blustery prose one connects more with old, rich drunks than authors.Veeck was a showman, con artist, life of the party (the story where several people took a tray of martinis to put a friend on a train in NYC then chartered a plane and met the friend in Cleveland with fresh martinis -- on the same tray -- is a classic), baseball man and all-around huckster.

Great writing style, and it could easily serve as a marketing textbook not just for baseball, but really in general. I felt like I was sitting down to have dinner with the man, and he was engaging me with stories of his career and imparting his wisdom.About half way through (right about the time the baseball establishment got sick of his antics and/or jealous of his success) the book turns into rant after rant about the various American League owners and officials that vexed him in his time with the Browns and out of baseball. Here, he turns into a grumpy old man complaining about the world, and playing the unappreciated genius. Now, granted, he was a baseball marketing genius, and, in fact, was right about many things (just as games being too long, the rise of football, Interleague play, etc), but saying so and pointing out who was wrong seems alot like sour grapes.Then there's a weird 40 pages or so in the middle about the social scene in Cleveland in the early 50s, which seems like it should be in a different book.Overall, though, a great book to read to start off baseball season."}, {"userName": "Alan Myszkowski", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7239029-alan-myszkowski", "userReview": "The most interesting arc this book manages to portray is the outside perspective of Veeck with the inner workings of his conscious mind. Which never seem to coincide with one another. Self-proclaimed enemies intertwine with his closest of friends, he runs successful operations while he fails at others, and he is prophetic yet unable to win the trust of any other owner. At the end of the day, his dire need to stay out of his fathers shadow leads him to a life of unconformity and political incorrectness to the outside world. However, his gratitude to ballplayers, willingness to mingle with fans, tireless work ethic, and loyalty to those in his past should be commended. He was a man with a huge heart who was unable to always control his emotions (which could be attributed to a lack of sleep). Was the book great? I dunno. Way too much owner financial jargon and not enough personal stories of legendary ballplayers deem it average in my mind.

Veeck knew how to run a team, and all gimmicks and promotions aside, he was wise beyond his years. You cannot refute this, either, because reading his autobiography with fifty two years of hindsight and history vindicates the man and his ideas. I was amazed at how backwards team owners were compared to today, because you learn that the traits that make a bad team owner have been universal constants, and that few, if any, ever question them.

Just wonderful."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/602205-stephanie", "userReview": "This was Erica's choice for Book Forcening.Some of the things Veeck did as a ball club owner are things familiar to anyone who attends games today. But some of the things he got up to (particularly surrounding the business side of the game) I cannot even imagine happening nowadays. Veeck definitely blazed his own trail, and he seems like the kind of guy who would be fun to gab a drink with.I'm not very knowledgeable on MLB history, so it's kind of fun to read about times when teams either didn't exist or where known by different names in different cities, and mull over what's changed (and hello, O'Malleys, what hasn't)."}, {"userName": "Chris Witt", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/223580-chris-witt", "userReview": "I feel like, were I 20 years older and read this when it first came out in the early 80s, I would've found it amazing. Instead, not so much. Kinda' want to give it 2.5 stars, but it's not an option.At times the book gets lost in bookkeeping, but the stories about the period of his life in Milwaukee and Cleveland were great.Still, for anybody interested in Veeck and/or baseball history of the 40s through 70s, it's an important book to read. Again, it might just be my problem. Those are probably the exact portions of baseball history that I happen to be least interested in. So it's me, not you."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18622-doug", "userReview": "A book about Veeck's life as a baseball owner, and from the midget batters to the fireworks shows and giveaways, there certainly has no lack of amusing and colorful anecdotes. I never understood how the baseball speech in Field of Dreams correlated to the comparatively sterile, corporate form of baseball today, but Veecks freewheeling style of running a baseball team harkens back to that era."}, {"userName": "William", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33331-william", "userReview": "I wondered why my rating was so much lower than the average for this book. It is fascinating...for baseball fans (and I am a baseball fan). Of little interest to others, and Veeck does not try to make it so because he wanders occasionally and includes details that don't add much to his story. For a narrative from 1962, however, Veeck does not pull any punches, and the book must have caused a stir in its day."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10930314-david", "userReview": "One of the funniest books a baseball fan could ever want. First read it in the '60s when Veeck was still active and re-read in 1976. He was responsible for many fan-friendly enhancements to sporting events, including fireworks when the home teams hit a home run or won a game.Lots of serious material, too, about how Veeck overcame financial difficulties to become an owner and about his battles with stick-in-the-mud old-time owners. But still humorous throughout."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25108-andy", "userReview": "Entertaining and rambling autobiography of one of the most interesting team owners in baseball history. Veeck was a guy who had a million war stories to tell, and he tells them in full yarn-spinning style, with all the strengths (funny, insightful, spontaneous) and weaknesses (disorganized, sometimes overextended) thereof. Great for baseball history fans or people interested in the politicking behind a professional sports league."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4632787-bill", "userReview": "This book is almost 50 years old (written in 1962). A very entertaining book written by a guy who preferred to do things his own way, and was definitely not afraid to rock the boat. In fact, he often insisted in rocking the boat because it needed to be rocked.I think you don't even have to be a baseball fan to enjoy Bill Veeck's story. This is the second time I've read this book. He had a different way of looking at things, and one can argue it was often a better way."}, {"userName": "Brian S", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1975631-brian-s", "userReview": "Veeck\u2019s days in Major League Baseball go all the way back to the Cubs teams of the 30s. The best part of the book is seeing how baseball functioned back then. Veeck\u2019s airing of grievances and dislike for other baseball movers and shakers, and the nasty disputes they had, gets a little tedious as the book goes on."}], "description": "Bill Veeck was an inspired team builder, a consummate showman, and one of the greatest baseball men ever involved in the game.
