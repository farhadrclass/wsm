I\u2019m not going to dock Meets Girl any stars for spelling and punctuation issues when you see books on the bestseller list from the likes of Clive Cussler, Jodi Picoult, etc. that have contained minor errors, as well. It happens. No one\u2019s perfect. I\u2019m certainly not, and neither are the stories that I write.Now, as for my likes/loves, there were many, so it\u2019s hard to know where to start.The beginning of Meets Girl transported me back to my own childhood and early teen years and the many hours I spent pining over a certain boy. (Unrequited love, you ask? Perhaps. I did like said boy for a long time, from second grade on, in fact. But he never liked me in return. Ah, such is life.)I also loved how it felt like I was being directly spoken to in the story. Because of that, I was able to close my eyes and picture the entire story unfolding in front of me. I felt the excitement and sadness, the rejection. The author\u2019s style of writing brought the book to life and made me feel connected to it, like I was a part of it. Although, I did feel like a bit of a voyeur during the sex scenes. (Mr. Entrekin is very adept at writing a love scene that can still make your heart race without getting too explicit. Nicely done!)I also loved the writer\u2019s internal struggle over what he wants in life when faced with the ultimatum of having to choose between the girl of his dreams or a successful writing career. It\u2019s definitely a struggle I can relate to. I think it\u2019s one we all face in some way at some point. That moment of having to choose one over the other. Which do you choose? And will you regret it for the rest of your life?Since I\u2019m a mom, it\u2019s especially prevalent. For a long time I thought I\u2019d never be able to follow my dreams. I honestly thought I\u2019d forfeited all my hopes and dreams once I became responsible for another human being. But I realized over time that I can do both. I can became mommy, and I can be a writer. I don\u2019t need to choose between the two, which is great because if push came to shove, I\u2019d have to choose my children.And while others may have expressed some disappointment in the way the book ended, I\u2019m not one of them. I loved it! I didn\u2019t see that ending coming, but I love that Will chose to end it that way. For me, it added a whole new layer to the story. What was real? What wasn\u2019t? I believe it\u2019s left up to the reader to decide, to interpret the way he or she wants to. I love when books do that. And I tried to do the same thing with A Second Chance. On the surface it seems very obvious what happened, but there are unanswered questions that I wanted my readers to answer themselves. Meets Girl allowed me that same liberty.I also loved how Meets Girl made me ask questions of myself aside from \u201cWhere do I begin?\u201d1- Why do I write? Do I do it solely to make my parents and brother proud? The answer is no. While their opinions are extremely important to me, I write because it\u2019s as vital to me as eating, breathing and sleeping. I\u2019m not me without it. And when I don\u2019t write, I feel lost, like part of me is missing.2- What do I want from life? I want what everyone wants. I want to be happy and healthy. I want to know that someone loves me for me. I want to see my kids grow up and accomplish all of their hopes and dreams. I want to inspire others with my writing. I want to make a difference. I want to know that I have no regrets when it\u2019s all said and done. I don\u2019t want to look back on my life and ask myself \u201cWhat if\u2026?\u201d3- Where do my ideas come from? I\u2019ve addressed that very question in the past. There are times that my stories seem to come from somewhere else, from an outside source, like I\u2019m the vessel hired to carry someone else\u2019s story to the distant shore. Other times, they come from personal experience, both the good and the bad.4- Is life truly what you make it? Yes, it is. I firmly believe that we all can make our lives what we want them to be. Sure, it\u2019s not an easy undertaking, but we all have that power within us. We just to have to be willing to work hard and not give up. And honestly, if you knew my entire story, you\u2019d see it\u2019s true. I\u2019ve worked damn hard to get where I am today. Why? Because I knew that I had control over my life. I could let it pass me by. Or I could take the reins and lead it where I wanted it to go. And I\u2019m glad I did.So in conclusion, Meets Girl was beautifully written and has left a lasting impression on me. As for Will Entrekin, he has a brilliant, creative mind, and there\u2019s no doubt he\u2019s got a very bright future ahead of him. I can\u2019t wait to read his next work of art."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3149503-bonnie", "userReview": "Overall, this probably garners closer to a 2 1/2 stars than 3. But, I'll be generous.It's hard to pin down this story, and what a reader is supposed to get out of it. At times, it is pretentious; I half-expected the narrator to live in Williamsburg instead of Hoboken. But in others, Entrekin shows a lovely command of the English language. Ultimately, the breaking-of-the-fourth-wall thing completely lost me. It's... interesting...? But not particularly effective as a storytelling tool."}, {"userName": "Wordsmith", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7584724-wordsmith", "userReview": "This little known book should be one of \"those\" books. You know the ones. Those rarefied gems that somehow break through, and we all feel as if (well, ok, some of them) surely must have a touch of the divine. Kind of like that feeling we get when listening to that young soprano, when suddenly, with unsurpassed talent, so refined and exquisite, out of her mouth comes that strung out, pure, highest note, perfectly met. Or when hearing a performance by that violin virtuoso, who transcends what we mortals even think of as 'merely'\u00a0a 'little bit' \u00a0human.\u00a0Thus, Will Entrekin begins Meets Girl; A Novel:\"Once upon a time I fell in love with a girl who didn't love me in return. And while that may not be, as openings go, altogether novel ( for who among us has not felt the sharp-barbed long-constant prick-pull of of unrequited love?), still I've always known it's how I need to begin this story. I've always known I'm going to eventually need the big guns if I intend to make my way through, and I've known that since before I even started, back when when I sitting next to Veronica--the girl with whom I fell in love but who did not love me in return--and across from Angus Silver, about whom I will tell you more as we go along, because Angus Silver is an idea you need to be eased into.\"THIS book by Will Entrekin is a virtuosic wonder of word weaving, dazzling in it's originality (despite at the most basic level, what we have is, boy loves a girl, she in return, loves him not. Do not be fooled by this, it's so much more than this) not only in it's presentation, add to this what we as readers recognize is a true homage, or you could say an ode, a joyous jubilation of words, of wordplay, literary allusions AND illusions done in the cleverest, softest, AND most charming voice I've come across in, well...could it be never?\u00a0It's a story of love, of not being loved, being loved, and yes of loving too much, but also of desire....for so many things. But mostly for the things....that are just, ohhh, so close...they are right THERE, you can ALMOST touch them. A hairsbreadth away from (just almost that close to) being attainable.\u00a0\"Boy\" is faced with the dilimena of choosing his hearts true desire. A \"shot\" to get all he wants or ever could, out of life. Who of us has ever been given \"this\" choice, literally, just handed, gifted, told its yours, but you must make the choice. Not that Boy was seeking this gifting of choices involving the fate of his future. Naturally, it WAS cause for a little musing and reflecting. It began, seemingly by happenstance. But, when things are fated, happenstance flys out the window. When Boy and Veronica walk past the building with the sign signaling the prescence of a Psychic, Veronica seriously wants to check this woman out. She, who supposedly has mystical powers and born with the light of clairvoyance, respected reader of the Ancient Tarot Cards. Boy cannot deny Veronica her hearts desire, so, in they go, to Boys future fate. It's in the cards. Or is it really?Let's tune in for a minute, to the voice of the Boy himself, while he tells his story, as no one else can.\u201cSince when are you into psychics?\u201d As long as I\u2019d known Veronica, her family had always been so Catholic she attended midnight masses on both Christmas and New Year\u2019s Eves with her parents and siblings, and I\u2019d always thought Catholicism had dismissed as heretic any of the arts that hadn\u2019t to do with the Christ Jesus and his holy parents. This I mentioned.\u201cOne of my roommates hired a fortune teller for a party we threw. She read my tarots earlier this semester. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m sacrificing goats to the dark lord.\u201d\u201cWell, no, but aren\u2019t you divining the future by way of questionable means?\u201d\u201cIt's not about divining the future. It's about seeking guidance considering present circumstances, and honestly, given present circumstances, I think you could use all the guidance you can possibly get. So come on,\u201d she said. She grabbed my elbow to guide me down the gravel driveway of a non-descript house. Around the corner, up a concrete stoop to a screen door marked solely by an \u201copen\u201d calligraphed sign. Through the screen wafted a sweet scent that stung my sinuses and made me want to blink.\u201cIt\u2019ll be fun,\u201d Veronica said. A small, silver bell wrapped with a fresh shoot of some indiscriminate herb tinkled when she opened the door for me, then followed behind.Inside, that scent was even stronger. The room beyond the door looked like a cross between someone\u2019s living room, someone else\u2019s curio closet, and a third person\u2019s sitting room, and none of them appeared to get along. Dark-patterned threadbare rug over a hardwood floor, two metal folding chairs next to a cabinet that looked like it should have been filled with fancy plates but instead contained makeshift, wooden figurines; a few crystal balls; and a few good-sized shards of quartz. A doorway, hungdown with wooden beads, close enough to obscure whatever was in the next room.\u201cLovely,\u201d I whispered. \u00a0\u201cGive it a chance,\u201d Veronica said.\u201cYes, please do,\u201d came a voice as a woman parted the beaded curtain. It\u2019s silly to say, and it feels sillier to write, but something about that woman struck me hard enough in the gut I couldn\u2019t speak for a moment. It wasn\u2019t that she was beautiful, though yes, there was that: she was short and petite, slender with long limbs and the kind of body that moves like it would rather be dancing, and she wore her spectacular red hair down, layered in waves highlit by a streak of white like a jagged edge to a sunset. She wore her green, crushed velvet dress tight enough I could probably guess her measurements (34c, 23, 33), and it scooped down from her pale, slender neck above her ample cleavage. And her eyes: green like jungles and foliage, green like growing things.But it was more than that. It was a sudden feeling of comfort, which inspired vulnerability; I think, in the weeks previous, I had worked hard on restraining my emotions, preventing them from showing, putting up a brave face and a convincing fa\u00e7ade. I didn\u2019t realize it until that moment, when the appearance of that woman in that room, so close to me, caused it to slough off like so much dead skin. It was like she had a cool, clear aura, and the scent of her, like citrus and freesia, like a slight breeze across a lake on a warm summer day, cut through the smell of incense like, well, a breath of fresh air. I breathed it deep, and I couldn\u2019t help smiling.\"Therein lies the dilemma. The crux of all who Boy is. He has two desires, above all others. Veronica Sawyer and writing. Ahhh, how he loves Veronica. His odes to her, could launch a thousand ships more than that other dude. His love for her is longer than a river, churning faster, sinking deeper, lasting forever.\u00a0Hear him tell it, in his own words, how much he loves Veronica Sawyer:\"Being a boy myself, I am no different, which is why I need to tell this story hoping for redemption, and that girl with whom I fell in love\u2014who did not love me in return\u2014was Veronica Sawyer. Veronica Sawyer has wavy, black hair highlit blonde and eyes the color of natural emeralds in mahogany. Veronica has a quick laugh and an easy smile and dresses like she belongs in a Banana Republic catalogue. Veronica speaks no fewer than three languages and knows how to request wine in several others besides. Veronica believes there is some point to graduate study in philosophy, and if you think, now, that I have somehow idealized Veronica Sawyer, I will say, simply, well, yes, that\u2019s very much the point, isn\u2019t it?\"Because it truly was that sort of Love. Veronica is that sort of girl whom boys meet and fall in love with and do spectacularly blunderous things for. Veronica Sawyer is the sort of girl who makes writers capitalize words, who in times of yore would have inspired gallant knights to find dragons solely that they might fight and slay them. Veronica is the sort of girl the memory of whom could have inspired Cervantes, in his squalid prison cell, to write of Quixote\u2019s Dulcinea, to dream the impossible dream, to fight the unbeatable foe. All of which, of course, is why I felt I needed to begin with those four famous words.\"\"Once upon a time I fell in love with a girl who didn't love me in return.\"But, this doesn't mean a Boy cannot dream, does it?\"Thanksgiving Eve, I saw Veronica at a Foolish gig, and we made plans to get coffee that Saturday at the local Barnes & Noble in the only strip-mall complex for miles, a classic-casual outing that on occasion flirts with being more than it is, date-wise, but never actually manages it. I don\u2019t know what you\u2019d call the fringe collar of the black suede coat she wore when she showed up, but it looked like short strands of fine, grey yarn all around her neck, which only brought out her green-blue eyes, lending to them the gravity of an imminent thunderstorm and all the ferocity of lightning. But still she smiled, and it made her float.I don\u2019t remember much about that conversation, but I\u2019m sure it was like any conversation Veronica and I have ever had\u2014long, digressing discussions of classes and life and movies and music, lyrics and dialogue. I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t long before conversation came back around to me and what I was doing, and when it did . . . well, it all just came out in one long, stream-of-consciousness soliloquy Kerouac would have needed Benzedrine and toilet-roll typing paper to keep speed with. I told her about how writing had ground down, how I just didn\u2019t know if I had the juice left to say much of anything worthwhile, and that, at the worst possible time, when I thought about devoting my energy to something else, that was when there didn\u2019t seem anything else to devote that energy to.\"But, then there IS his writing. For Boy, it is like breathing. It is who he IS. He wants to write, he NEEDS to write, but not just ANY writing, glorious writing that will linger for centuries. And he's got the talent to back up his lofty goal.\"It runs silent and deep to find, within me, the memories of my mother reading me Little Bear and \u201cThe Leap-frog\u201dA Flea, a Grasshopper, and a Leap-frog once wanted to see which could jump highest; and they invited the whole world, and everybody else besides who chose to come to see the festival.\u2014and Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland\u2014Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do: once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no pictures or conversations in it, \u201cand what is the use of a book,\u201d thought Alice, \u201cwithout pictures or conversations?\u201d\u2014and stories about mist-shrouded castles overlooking emerald green realms. Wolves with big teeth, and evil stepsisters. Bears and chairs and porridge-eating intruders, evil witches and alchemical hobgoblins, grandmother\u2019s house and gingerbread cottages. It calls to my mind Disney princes with thick, black hair and big, blue eyes, who gallop trusty steeds through sun-dappled forests in enchanted lands to save from untold danger the women they love, because the one thing all princes charming have in common is the girls in whose names they pursue their noble quests.Princes charming are silly like that.But then, all boys are. I once heard a story about William Faulkner, known to many as a Nobel laureate\u2014\"It is the writer\u2019s privilege to help man endure by lifting his heart, by reminding him of the courage and honor and hope and pride and compassion and pity and sacrifice which have been the glory of his past.\"\u2014 but known to probably more as an Oprah pick, and known to some few besides as a Hollywood writer. My own favorite work ever by William Faulkner is his adaptation of Raymond Chandler\u2019s The Big Sleep, one of Hollywood\u2019s first, not to mention smartest, action movies, much of which one can attribute to Chandler himself\u2014When in doubt, have a man come through the door with a gun in his hand.\u2014and the thing about The Big Sleep, the reason it\u2019s among Faulkner\u2019s finest work, is simple: Faulkner knew what the story was about. It\u2019s ostensibly a crime-noir, with stolen pictures and missing persons and triple crosses, and it\u2019s easy to get lost in the complicated plot, but Faulkner understood the story was simple and reminded himself of it in a very simple way. His supervisors and managers did not know of his reminder until after he had left Hollywood and they cleaned out his desk to find two items.The first was a bottle of Jack Daniels. Which I would say makes sense because Faulkner was a writer, but that would only propagate the myth of writers as drunks and bypass the truth: Faulkner was an alcoholic, who sometimes thought he wrote best when he was intoxicated but, given the state of his novels, perhaps should have waited till he had sobered up to revise them.The second is more important: a single sheet of paper on which was typed, over and over and over again, in classic 12-point Courier font, a single phrase:Boy meets girl.Because that is what so many stories hinge upon. Not all of them, I know: some are about whales or a young girl\u2019s adventures in a strange world or even\u2014well, I'm not entirely certain what A Tale of Two Cities was about, but then, who is?\u2014but many of the real ones, the true ones, begin with a boy meeting a girl.Because that\u2019s what we do. We meet girls, and we fall in love with them, and then the real silliness begins. In ode to their beauty we compose poetry\u2014Who will believe my verse in time to come?\u2014and in honor of their faces we launch a thousand ships. In pursuits of their oft-capricious affections, we undertake quests of monumental foolishness. We tilt at windmills. We storm castles using only a wheelbarrow and holocaust cloak despite that we were mostly dead mere moments before and have been revived solely via ingestion of miraculous chocolate dispensed by Billy Crystal in bad prosthetics. Hell, I\u2019m not sure what sort of motivation Melville said Ahab had, but he gave his character a peg-leg and an obsessive quest for a marine creature whose most distinguishing feature, besides a \u2018hump like a snow-hill,\u2019 was a blowhole, both of which sound more than a little Freudian to me.\"______________________________________________________________Ahh, the wordplay. Abounding throughout Meet Girl. Still I must ask this? What's more important? What would YOU CHOOSE? Themes of Faust and the Devil himself ooze through enigmatic Angus Silver, popping into Boy's life with an offer he claims he's doled out to other genius's along times long line. And really, just WHO is this Mr. Silver? Appearing from nowhere ever made clear to Boy or to us for that matter, oh yes this man is a complete mystery. He's all attired in Hermes, a purveyor of the finest and rarest aromatic Spirits to be found on this planet. And oh yes, they must be sipped in the spirit with which they were intended. Male bonding and all that. Really. Who is this man? And now, more than ever, what's a boy to do?\u00a0Here is what Boy has to say about Angus:Beyond those doors: nothing, at first, but light, though of that there was enough I thought I might have tanned just standing there. I felt my eyebrows rise and my arm followed suit, even, as I started to shade my eyes, but then the intensity faded abruptly to allow into visibility the sharp-cut suited silhouette who could only be Angus himself.\u201cMy boy,\u201d he said, stepping forward, through the doors, sweeping into the lobby a great rush of charcoal and animation, a quick-sketch of business and the way it\u2019s meant to be conducted. He looked nearly the same as he had the night I\u2019d met him, the dark suit that might have been a Herm\u00e9s and the sharp eyes, but he seemed more vibrant, more alive, as if the room around him leant to him a power he in turn could conduct at will. \u201cSo glad you took the time to swing by my humble offices,\u201d he told me, and if he had a smile like doing business, he shook my hand like he\u2019d already closed it.\u201cI\u2019m not sure \u2018humble\u2019 is the first word I would have thought of.\u201dLATER-IN THAT SAME MEETING:And yes, there was a side of me that considered simply getting up and walking away without another word spoken, but the moment I acknowledged that part of me, I also acknowledged it as a rather unexciting part of me. Maybe it\u2019s silly or idealistic, but a bigger part of me had grown up reading stories of boy wizards and tales of high intrigue, that had graduated on to reading about American gods and Anansi\u2019s boys. That bigger part might have been the same part of Jack that had traded the cow for those beans, the same part of Alice that had taken off after the White Rabbit.I had long ago given up on flying, but that part of me that would have traded his cow for beans or followed after Alice and her rabbit wondered if the simple act of belief was even more powerful a magic than flight. I wasn\u2019t sure, but finding out . . . I didn't necessarily have to believe him to just sit there and listen a while longer, and why not?Besides, I hadn\u2019t yet finished my beer.Angus smiled when I picked it up. \u201cI realize it will be difficult at first to believe, but really it is no different from the idea of Gods and gardens and men walking up mountains to return with constitutions. What I\u2019m telling you, in fact, is a lot less myth and a lot more truth.\u201dHis words reminded of Pilate confronting Jesus behind the closed doors of the Roman consulate, the voice of the crowd so loud it surpassed the stones: \u201cWhat is truth?\u201dAngus snapped his fingers, and suddenly: what starts the fourth movement, the famous Ode to Joy, of Beethoven\u2019s final symphony? I\u2019m reasonably sure it's the strings section, but those opening notes seem too deep and full to come from violin; I\u2019m thinking a cello, something big and proud enough you have to spread your legs to play it, and my God can those notes catch you there, in the groin, less in lust than in purely physical love. I mean, if falling in love at first sight came with a soundtrack, it would have to be that, wouldn\u2019t it, with that great highness like euphoria, the strings trilling and wriggling up and down scales like water over rocks?I don\u2019t know what Angus did for those acoustics, but it sounded like I was sitting beside the cellist.I could hear each individual string. Is there anything in the world like Beethoven to open you? I mentioned that feeling of possibility, of decision, but Jesus, the Ninth Symphony is like a key to what makes us human, not just unlocking those parts of us we have secreted away but convincing us to open ourselves to the possibility of life. It\u2019s like you listen and you feel like someone else gets it, all the pain and all the joy, all the sorrow and all the kindness, all the sadness and all the happiness inherent in every moment you\u2019ve ever been alive. Listening to it is as much like falling in love with music as it is like trusting the world, because for those fifteen or twenty minutes of that final movement, what possible harm could befall you?When Angus spoke, his voice was quiet in reverence. \u201cHe came to me when they still called him Luigi. He wanted to write songs that would touch the heart of anyone who heard them. I asked if he\u2019d mind never hearing them himself.\u201dI swallowed but didn\u2019t say anything. I don\u2019t think I trusted myself to.Even just the thought hurt, but I gave it voice: \u201cVeronica.\u201dAnd so this is a story about a Boy who Loves a Girl. This is an awesome story about a Boy who Loves a Girl. This is so much MORE than story about a Boy who Loves a Girl. This is one Great Story, PERIOD!

I read it in one week, which I haven't done with a book in a really long time. Obviously, something about the book spoke to me. I connected with it. It hit me in the soul. And hell, maybe I'm a hopeless romantic too. I'm avoiding saying much because I don't like being spoiled, and I don't want to spoil for others. The book is written entirely in first person. It's a style that is purposeful for this book and works to an extent. Sometimes it is meandering and little too detailed, a little too stream of consciousness, but that comes with being written in the perspective of somebody's thoughts. There's an odd zooming in on little details and tangents about these details, that don't seemingly lead anywhere, and it can get frustrating when you get back from the tangent and you forgot what was being talked about, but it's part of the style of the writing here. The one piece I had trouble with is the third act, which gets a little confusing and hard to keep track of.The story itself is magnificent, it is a love story but it's hardly close to the bs romantic comedies that are pumped through Hollywood. There's elements of that, but if it was just copying those cliches, I would never give this story a high rating. In some ways, it never really bucks the cliches, it's got a lot of them, but it's subversively analyzing how those cliches work and how they work the way they do, helped along by the crumbling of that fourth wall. The most important part is how it made me think. A lot of this book plays on the idea of pre-conceived destiny vs. agency, hope, happiness (what it means, how to achieve it). And there's no answers to any of it, just like life has no answers. The is a hopeful note though, which while it punched me in the gut, put a smile on my face. I really liked this one, there's some roughness, but it's definitely worth the read. You hit me in my soul Will, thanks, and you're welcome."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333423-michelle", "userReview": "Once upon a time, I read a book. To be honest, it wasn't just once upon a time that I read a book, for I've read more books than I can enumerate. Books that I cherish still today; books that I have thrown across the room in frustration. Books I've read dozens of times, and books that I could barely finish the first page. Let me start again...Once upon a time, I read THIS book. This book that reached past the fourth wall and grabbed me by the heart.This book full of pop culture and literary references that made me feel more connected to it than I should have been to any piece of fiction. This book that built up a history of always knowing what you want more than life itself, but never quite being able to reach it. This book that begged the question, what would you do if you were being offered everything you ever wanted - with a catch.\"Meets Girl\" is more than just your everyday average boy-meets-girl love story. It's a story within a story. It is a love story, but it's also a story about discovery, and realization, and loss, and inherent truths.I won't rehash the plot because 1. most other reviewers already have, and 2. discovering the plot for yourself is part of the fun. I'm the kind of person who could likely tell you the entire plot, and twist, of nearly everything I read or watch before I read or watch it. This wasn't one of those books. Or perhaps I was thrown off by the quirky style of writing, with chapter numbers that were descriptive, and paragraphs that continued from one chapter to the next. Regardless, I was engaged from the start, and had a hard time putting the book down long enough to sleep and go to work (truth be told, I spent much of my day reading in my office).\"Meets Girl\" will find its Happily Ever After in my permanent collection."}, {"userName": "Tyrone Hayes", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18744856-tyrone-hayes", "userReview": "Their are several problems with this book. This first is that there is no conflict. Everyone in the book seems to exist to to tell the main character he is wonderful. Some of the characters fall all over themselves to do so. The story is a flat line from beginning to end.The next problem is Will pays to much attention to extraneous detail. It's one thing to describe an object or a room. It's another to give every detail of said things. Will strays from the story so often to spend pages describing something meaningless, that by the time he got back to the story, I forgot what was going on.Another problem is when a new character is introduced, Will goes into great detail describing the character and where they came from. Then the new character will have a brief conversation with the main character and never be in the book again. Why go into so much detail about a minor character? It's just more extraneous information.My final problem is I feel will treats his readers like they are idiots. Often going to great detail to explain the main characters every move. Ultimately,a book should lead you by the hand and let you just use your imagination. This book is a rope around your neck, dragging you around with to much detail and filler. If you took out all of the nonsense you would have a 20 page book that may be more entertaining to read."}, {"userName": "Samuel", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9476572-samuel", "userReview": "This book had compelling language, as evidenced through it's skilled use of metaphor & simile to describe events and emotions. It also has an inspired premise, though it doesn't cop to it at first. I was, in the reading of this book, fully prepared to give it five stars for well-deserved excellence. The reason I didn't, and instead gave it two stars, is because of the ending. The ending was certainly unconventional, but that isn't why it galled me. What did was the nature of it. It was, in my opinion, the result of an author writing an analysis of their own book and then putting that inside said book. I am usually inclined to hear an author's opinion on their own work, as well as any symbolism they intended. That said, I do not want that in the story. A story is a story, and I find it extremely irritating when an author stops the story to have a discussion. If a message can't be carried effectively by showing, rather than telling, I prefer it not be included. Despite this major drawback to the book, I would still strongly suggest this book. Anyone who finds beautiful language and storytelling compelling should give this a look. Fans of stories with fantastical elements, romance fans (squicky ethics aside), and fans of explorations of the nature of free will might also give this a look-see."}, {"userName": "Allie Burke", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31381292-allie-burke", "userReview": "As a reader, you don't really expect that book. You know the one: that book that makes you think about every book you've ever read. A book which alters your perceptions of what a good book is, what it isn't, or how a story should be told in order for you to love it. Until you come across the book that makes you realize that there is no right way and there's really no way of knowing exactly what you're going to love until you do. This book is that book!Meets Girl is the first of Entrekin's work I have read. I loved how it opened with Once Upon a Time.Usually you know when you are going to love a book immediately (at least I tend to), and this one was no different. Entrekin's style captured me from the first page; he has a beautiful prose. I really do love this book.The story itself was innovative and brilliant; realistic and unexpected. It was unlike most books in the way that it effectively combines genres without becoming overbearingly literate. Meets Girl should be considered a modern classic because of this ability.It was very funny, suspenseful, and sad. The romance really pulls on the heartstrings without being sappy or anything like that. It's a really important addition to bookshelves everywhere."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1920211-heather", "userReview": "The beginning 2/3 or so of the book would have been five stars, maybe even six. I'm not always into the \"broken fourth wall\" stuff, where the author talks directly to the reader, but it WORKS here. Unfortunately, as I kept reading, the spelling and grammar mistakes increased. I can certainly tolerate a few, but I began noticing them, and then every one I found gave me a little pop of irritation. This is such a good book that it really deserves another proofreading round to remove these glitches. They're little (\"saif\" instead of \"said\", for example) but aggravating.The ending didn't quite work for me either. I was left not quite sure what had happened.

There was a portion of the novel (maybe 20%) I enjoyed and I didn't find myself pausing often to note the things I didn't like. I liked Angus' character and his business, the hint of the supernatural that you can't be sure is a matter of reality or perception. The rest of the time I was annoyed at the author's decision to spell out the story's formula, fill the pages with needless asides, and add copious amounts of boring, extraneous details that leaves the reader breathlessly asking, \"SO WHAT?\" The core ideas would have been successful in the hands of a more skilled, more natural storyteller."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6305184-jill", "userReview": "I find it hard to describe this book. At times I loved it, at other times I found it frustrating. It would not surprise me to see this novel as a book included in a college literature or even philosophy class at some point, because it makes you think. I can imagine the questions for discussion or essay topics on this book. I only gave it 3 stars, because I admit to loving books with a happy ever after ending. If it had ended the way I wanted it to I would have given it 5 stars, which I realize is shallow on my part. The ending of this book makes you think.

The story is not so original and the writing, at times, could be quite mediocre. My head tells me I should give it a 3 or 4, but my heart tells me to give it a 5. Certain parts were so well-written, it made ache. And in other places, the emotion was so real, the fourth wall crumbled. I don't know what it is, but I really love this book right now.
