Originally a way to kill time while I was at jury duty, Jaron Lee Knuth's trilogy was a welcome surprise for me. Book three took forever to come out and now that it has, I can honestly say that the ending was better than I had hoped.Separated from his friends and hunted by DotGov agents, Nexworld Gamester Arkade is on the run. With his Level Zero allies (artificial intelligences that boost his gaming and hacking abilities) he desperately searches for allies as he attempts to free the inhabitants and players of Nextworld from DotGov's iron grip. Forced to make sacrifices that he would never have imagined when he first met his friends, Arkade (Kane in the real world) shows us just what a true gamer is capable of. Join Arkade, Fantom, Cyren, Xen and the resistance one last time in this virtual world of danger and intrigue.I love video games, though I've never played an MMO before. Knuth imagines a world where our entire economy, culture, society transpires within a virtual world. The real world is a dirty, polluted, messy place that is unhealthy for human habitation. But in Nexworld, we can live out our fantasies, provided we can afford it. One of the biggest draws about this book was its take on societal and theological issues such as what differentiates a real player from an NPC, freedom vs. government control, personal accountability vs. selfishness, and the prospect of eternal life within a virtual universe. It's very though-provoking, nothing like what I expected when I read the first book. The conflicts brought up then are clearly defined and addressed in this conclusion.As for complaints, the story got off to a slow start. I missed the days when ARkade would go guns blazing into a virtual arena and use tactics and skill to outwit his enemies. There's some action, but it takes place roughly halfway through the book. I kind of wished they traveled through more games worlds, which is what attracted me to this series in the first place. These are all minor gripes, though, of still had fun reading it.So farewell to Arkade and to Dangerwar. May we meet in a virtual paradise."}, {"userName": "Al", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5874769-al", "userReview": "This is a great ending to the Nextworld series. Right off the bat I loved the book cover. Xen looks awesome. I couldn't put down the story. I read it so fast. There was plenty of action and emotion. I felt like screaming, \"NOOOOOO!!!!\" at one point in the book. I loved the book and I am sad to see the trilogy end. Thank you Jaron for such a great series."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5962759-jackie", "userReview": "I`m satisfied with this conclusion to the NextWorld series.

Main character started out hard to like but as he grows he kinda grows on you."}], "description": "Arkade's quest to protect the woman he loves has only succeeded in dooming his friends.
