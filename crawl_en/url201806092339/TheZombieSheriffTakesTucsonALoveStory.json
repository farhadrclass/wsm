Zombies and humans living side-by-side, each trying to eradicate the other. This tale is told from an Old West perspective but with some modern day sensibilities thrown in. It's hilarious! My favorite part is listening to the zombies have these very intelligent conversations. They speak Zombese. It's great!"}, {"userName": "Frederick Crook", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25821390-frederick-crook", "userReview": "This book had me hooked and laughing from the very beginning. The world the Brian South has created is that of zombies, referred to as \u2018ghouls\u2019 by uninfected humans, while they are called, \u2018slickskins\u2019 by the ghouls.\tThe story takes place in Arizona, where we find the protagonist, a ghoul with no name that everyone refers to as the sheriff. He doesn\u2019t remember his own name, but the tin star on his vest tells him who he was, or is. He\u2019s after a slickskin named, MacFarland, who is a known killer of ghouls.\tAlong the way, the sheriff meets a group of fellow ghouls known as \u2018Chester\u2019s Brigade\u2019, a zombie vigilante squad that has been formed to take their fight to the slickskins, whom they see as the aggressive species.\tI haven\u2019t laughed so much while reading a book since \u201cThe Hitchhiker\u2019s Guide to the Galaxy\u201d. The humor is thick with references to pop culture, \u2018slickskin\u2019 pop culture, that is, and the characters are very well and gruesomely described.\tTo add to the sheriff\u2019s problems, a slickskin by the name of Abernathy Jones tracks him. They were friends in the sheriff\u2019s former life. The sheriff finds another nemesis in the likes of the \u2018evil\u2019 Dr. Gimmler-Heichman, a man that has devised a \u2018cure\u2019 for ghoulishness.\tI couldn\u2019t stop smiling while I read this, even while limbs and heads went flying and the blood and gore flowed like rainwater. South\u2019s got a talent for humor in the most gruesome of situations, and I sure hope that a sequel is coming soon. 5 of 5 stars from me."}, {"userName": "George", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24584948-george", "userReview": "mr. south is a cool beans"}, {"userName": "AudioBookReviewer", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7365795-audiobookreviewer", "userReview": "My original THE ZOMBIE SHERIFF TAKES TUCSON audiobook review and many others can be found at Audiobook Reviewer.For the most part, in the genre of Zombies, they are supposed to be single-minded, brain and flesh seekers and eaters. Mostly anyway! Brian South creates a new world where the zombies are actually the victims of a gang of bounty hunting outlaws who hunt zombies for their leader to experiment on. Add in the old west, a famous (now a zombie) lawman, and a town of ghouls. The Sheriff gathers the most skillful \u201czombie\u201d town residents together and they go after Chester\u2019s Brigade and McFarland \u2013 humans who hunt and kill zombies for sport and money. Jezebel, a female zombie who is being held prisoner for the experiments by the humans captures the heart of the sheriff who is driven to find her and rescue her.South does an excellent job of building up each character both main and not as they all play an important role. Vivid in his descriptions one cannot help but be sucked into the tale and see what is developing with each page. South draws the reader in with his ability to tell a story with vivid rich imagery. By the time you finish the book it is as if you have actually met and rode with the characters.The plot is that of an old western \u2013 save the girl and the town while ridding the world of the bad guys. That\u2019s it though! There\u2019s no question of saving the world or beating back hordes of zombies to survive. These zombies don\u2019t really bother slick-skins except to serve them up as delicacies!This is a wonderful tale of zombies \u2013 light, fun and witty. Taking the theme of the old spaghetti westerns \u2013 sheriff vs the bad guys, rescues the damsel and the town \u2013 and mixing it with the zombie genre one has a delightful tale that captures the imagination and tickles the funny bone. Imagine zombies on horses! How do they ride them without eating them? Lots of willpower and even then it\u2019s not always doable.This book was enjoyable for several reasons \u2013 a new approach on zombies, the zombies being personified giving one a glimpse into who they once were and are now, how easily it is for humans to attack and kill things they do not understand, and that there is even love among the walking dead!If you are looking for a horror filled, flesh ripping zombie book \u2013 this is not it. South does not explain how the zombies came to be or why there is even a town of them left to lurk in or the lack of Native American Indians. He does however explain how zombies understand one another \u2013 the language of zombies is zombie-eese.The narrator, Rich Miller, was good as he kept the book flowing with an easy tone. His pronunciation was solid and his voices were ok. Not many men can do female voices well.There were no issues with production.A must read!!!!Audiobook was provided for review by the narrator."}], "description": "Honor. Justice. Brains.Perched on the border between civilized ghoulkind and the chaos of the barbaric slickskins, the zombie sheriff must rescue his kidnapped friends from the dastardly McFarland and his notorious gang of outlaws. He assembles a posse of the most talented zombies around, including Mungo, a zombie chef interested in locally sourced ingredients, Bub, a barber whose enormous strength somewhat makes up for his complete lack of intelligence, and Dr. Callahan, a would-be pacifist who reattaches misplaced limbs with gusto. As the posse tracks McFarland, they soon realize that they themselves are being pursued. The ever-courteous Abernathy Jones, as quick with his business cards as he is with his deadly cane, is out to settle an old score from the sheriff\u2019s pre-zombie past, though exactly what he wants is anyone\u2019s guess.Even more troubling, the sheriff begins to hear rumors that the true reason for his friends\u2019 abduction is to provide test subjects for the sadistic experiments of the mysterious Dr. Gimmler-Heichman.The Zombie Sheriff Takes Tucson: A Love Story is the absurd, tongue-through-cheek tale of reanimated cowboys, undying love, and the lengths to which one zombie will go for justice.
