It is not needed here, the story is so well written.Jack Hamlyn has created a cast of characters that carry the story, we have our hero (Steve), his loving wife (Ricki), the crazy sister in law, the stable calm neighbour and the crazy survivalist nut case (where would a Zombie story be without him), and of course the lovable kid who has to grow up to quickly. All of these characters are so well developed, they are now my friends. I need to see what happens to them next.Reading Necrophobia felt like watching an episode of the Walking Dead, Hamlyn brought the story to life. I would put Necrophobia right up there with Hater and Day By Day Armageddon. It was that good!www.2bookloversreviews.com"}, {"userName": "Andres", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20026021-andres", "userReview": "Damn good zombie bashing funJust when I think I'm done with tales from the undead apocalypse Necrophobia creeps along and snatches me back in with it's cold, rotting claws.

A nice throw-back in a day when most zombie works feature the infected. Make no mistake- if you're bitten, but happen to escape being torn to shreds, you'll still expire and come back shortly, but it begins when the dead rise from their graves. This origin lends itself to some terrific visuals of not just the 'eaten' corpses staggering around, but the ones long (or not so long) buried who've escaped the grave. A nice change of pace, in my eyes. The story is very well written. I love it when it just flows, and you can get immersed in the story, instead of jumbled up in oddly-phrased bits or weird word choices or reptitive wording. There was none of that here. Some phrases were so well done that I read them more than once, just to savor them a bit more-they were that good. The author has a knack for 'realistic' descriptions that just feel...right. Have you ever read a zombie novel where the descriptions just don't 'work', but feel artificial and stiff instead? Again, none of that here- beautifully done. I could count the minor editing errors (misplaced comma, missing comma, that kind of thing) on one hand, so no big distractions there. I really enjoyed the characters. Their interactions and personalities were believable, and comfortable. There were no way-out-of-left- field additions thrown in here to force the story along, no actions on any characters part that felt artificial to strong arm the story in a certain direction. The characters, and their actions, decisions, and behaviors, all felt very natural and true to life. There's a nice balance between battling/surviving the dead and tangling with less-than-savory survivors here. Both are a huge issue, and both types of conflict were well-rounded and well done, making for a very enjoyable read. This one fell short of a five star read due to a few minor issues I had. Starting off, there's a lot of Right/Republican bashing, particularly aimed at Fox News and the like. I'm not a huge fan myself, but it's a major turn-off for me when an author interjects personal views just for the hell of it. Had the strong opinion worked to shape the main character, to set up a tangible, important piece of the puzzle as to what makes him tick, then fine, I wouldn't mind. But the Right bashing added nothing but a peek into the author's political views. It was just political rhetoric thrown in to get it in, instead of benefitting the story. Not a fan, not in the least. Fortunately, after 2 or 3 episodes of this nonsense in the first half of the book, it disappeared. At one point, one minor character is very clearly going to be a detriment to the group. It's not exactly his fault as he's not in his right mind, but it's clear to both the reader, and the other characters, that no good will come of that one and he'll probably endanger the whole group. Still nothing is done to prevent this. There's a group-wide \"He's going to get us all killed\" feeling, yet everyone kind of shrugs it off and wrings their hands instead of being pro-active about it. A snag in an otherwise fantastic tale. My last complaint is a small one, but I still didn't care for it. At various points in the story, hand-drawn maps to demostrate how an area is set up, or pictures/basic info about military weapons, are randomly inserted. I found them distracting and unnecessary. If the author did a good job assmebling the setting with his/her words, I don't need a map, thanks. I'm not a military buff, but I have enough of a general idea to get a workable picture of various weapons and equipment in my head. Finding random maps and pictures in the book just yanked me out of the story and I found them distracting and unwelcome.  This is a worthwhile read, in general, as the author writes quite well and the story's a good one. If you enjoy 'realistic' zombie apocalypse stories, with realistic charcters and happenings, this is one to read."}, {"userName": "Lucas Darathy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27597430-lucas-darathy", "userReview": "This was a good story. I liked the MC right from the start and I had fun with the book. It was well written and well developed (though it had some spelling/grammar mistakes).That said, I feel like it focused too much on the battle scenes. I get it, it's a zombie book.

As an author, we can be very critical of other books. We know what to look for. I love horror, and lately especially zombie fiction.Jack Hamlyn created believable characters that I care about, something I look for in an enjoyable read. There was plenty of action and gore for fans that love action, and a well though out plot.As someone who comes from a military family, I really liked the details on guns used, even to pictures. I loved the use of a tank. Very cool.Finally, I absolutely love the fact that not all the characters were killed off by the end. That they plan to fight their way back for at least a small segment of humanity. It depresses me when so many zombie novels end in despair and no chance for humans to survive. I'm working on my own zombie book and that is an important element to me.This author will be on my read list, and I look forward to the 2nd in this series.Myra Nourwww.myranour.netwww.booktrailershowcase.com"}, {"userName": "Jeremy Poole", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8567012-jeremy-poole", "userReview": "Necrophobia by Jack HamlynA good effort at my favorite genre.
