I was drawn to this freebie I found via Amazon as I have enjoyed her short stories in the past. I grew up in the rural mountains of northern Pennsylvania, foothills to the Alleghenies. Although that area is technically not New England, my forefathers who first settled that part of the Commonwealth came out of New England, and they brought much of that culture with them. In fact, I would say with confidence that the top strip of Pennsylvania, the part once originally claimed by Connecticut and first settled by folks moving westward from that region, bears not the imprint of Philadelphia or Pittsburgh culture, but most fundamentally and historically, the New England sensibilities I find here in the writings of Jewett. This literature makes me think a lot about the worldview and experiences of my grandmother, who was born in 1887 and would surely have understood the attitudes and issues raised in Jewett\u2019s writings.That grandmother raised my father to become a country doctor, so when I saw the title Country Doctor I decided to read the book and get a better sense of the social and professional activities of a rural physician in 1890\u2019s Maine. There is a kindly old, cheerful and wise, country doctor in this novel, just as I had hoped, but the main focus is on his ward Nan, left an orphan while still a baby. It is the rather daring (for its day) tale of how this heroine realizes her talent and future lie in becoming a physician, and how she deals with the powerful gender prejudices and cultural hurdles that might deter her from her goal. It is a coming-of-age story, but we get to watch her grow up in the country, move to the small town, and then visit a wealthy relative in a small city as she develops, and Jewett sketches out the social and dialectic distinctions admirably.In addition to the novel, this edition includes some sketches and short stories at the end that are quite good, too. One describes how a small community organizes and holds its first \u201cDecoration Day\u201d celebration (what we now know as Memorial Day), another tells the tale of an old lady who runs away from the poor farm to check out the wondrous celebration of the Bicentennial in Philadelphia in 1876, and a third gives a rather distressing account of life for immigrant French Canadian and Irish workers at a mill when the economy takes a nose dive and the rich stockowners decide to max out their profits while they can and let the workers cope as they are able\u2014that last one made quite an impression on me as I reflected on America\u2019s current economic problems, who is making out well, who isn\u2019t, and what the rich say we should do about it."}, {"userName": "Robertcool", "userReviewDate": "Mar 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5799351-robertcool", "userReview": "I enjoyed the novel that had a bit of an early feminist outlook, from an 1880's point of view.
