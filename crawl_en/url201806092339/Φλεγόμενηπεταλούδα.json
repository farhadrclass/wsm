I think Vera is an important and under read writer; for a bit of background, follow this link;https://literature.britishcouncil.org...This novel is set in Bulawayo; Vera\u2019s home town, in the late 1940s. It concerns a young woman called Phephelaphi who lives with an older man, Fumbatha, a construction worker. They live in one room; concrete and asbestos. Phephelaphi, however, is not satisfied with just being and has ambitions to be a nurse; this is beyond Fumbatha\u2019s comprehension. The language is lyrical and poetic, the whole is beautifully written. It could be argued that the poetic language makes some of the difficult and challenging passages less sharp. However I think the poetic language adds to the power of the writing. It is important not to forget that this is set within the context of colonialism and an Imperial power occupying Zimbabwe. We see early on a hanging in 1896; Fumbatha\u2019s father and the effects of this can be charted throughout the book. Vera, though, focuses on gender because women have to fight for their own space and bodies; but there is a backdrop of a lack of employment and social cohesion. Portraying the African nation as feminine is not new; as Grace Musila points out:\u201cnationalist discourses constituted the African nation as the feminine victim of an aggressive colonial master; the prostitute\u2019s body became a convenient index for the degraded postcolonial nation\u201dVera is reacting against this; Phephelaphi resists the appropriation of her own body. Vera is concerned in all her work about the role of women in colonial and post-colonial contexts; looking at \u201cwomen in the shadows\u201d. At one level we are looking at the outworking of a universal storyline. A possessive man unable to allow his partner to develop and be herself for fear of losing her. Vera refracts the story through the prism of colonialism. This is clear from the beginning;\u201cIn the air the sound of a sickle cutting grass along the roadside where black men bend their backs in the sun and hum a tune, and fume, and lullaby\u201d; and its Kwela music\u2014\u201dKwela means to climb into the waiting police Jeeps. This word alone has been fully adapted to do marvelous things. It can carry so much more than a word should be asked to carry; rejection, distaste, surrender, envy. And full desire.\u201dAnd in relation to the setting, Bulawayo;\u201cBulawayo is not a city of idleness. The idea is to live within the cracks. Unnoticed and unnoticeable, offering every service but with the capacity to vanish when the task required is accomplished. So the black people learn how to move through the city with speed and due attention, to bow their heads down and slide past walls, to walk without making the shadow more pronounced than the body or the body clearer than the shadow. It means leaning against some masking reality\u2014they lean on walls, on lies, on music\u201dIndeed Fumbatha feels that Phephelaphi\u2019s need for more than him is a compromise with colonialism;\u201cFumbatha does not encourage her, instead, he reminds her of what they share. \u201cWe are happy together. I work. I take care of you. It is not necessary for you to find something else.\u201d He insists on her unwavering loyalty. He mistrusts the city which does not understand the sort of triumph a man and a woman can find and share in their solitude. Does no one know that he is willing to die on the palm of Phephelaphi\u2019s hand?\u201dThe backdrop of the rhythms of Kwela music link to the rhythms of liberation. The shocking ending embodies another type of liberation. There is a cathartic quality about it all and this is a powerful novel."}, {"userName": "Aubrey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4119460-aubrey", "userReview": "Noon is too much like the middle of things, not a useful time for proposals, conclusions and disasters. Noon is just that, sunlight pouring down to melt shadows, and therefore, too many witnesses to every fall.\nThe hope for writing lies in the writers who treat with it as a limb and not with themselves as a god. To flex composition as musculature entails the burn of acid when oxygen is rendered insufficient, the pain of tearing in the aim of new growth, the itch of healing bone and the chance of spilling blood. None of this means anything to a god, who uses and chooses and appeals within the safety of that circle that is the right subject, the right grammar, the right self. In literature as in life, there is little chance that they will be cut down far too soon. There is plenty of time to indulge in the hegemony of current times and call its aspects universal.\nAn axis is an anchor, an origin, not the emotion itself. Emotion is much more charged and cannot be fastened to a single location; it consumes the whole body. The body relents like a canoe keeling over in turbulent streams, then skims the surface of the water to a welcoming border, without sinking; something about the weight of wood, the apex, the slender vessel, and the position of the drowned.\nFact: This work is one of Africa's 100 Best Books of the 20th Century. Fact: Yvonne Vera, Zimbabwe-born and Canada-expatriated, died on the cusp of her fourth decade. Fiction, as all opinions, even the historical ones, are: I can't be the only one to find this work excruciating in the sense of the sublime. Ignore the phallic gargantuan context established for the word long ago, if you please. It's not my fault modern English is so insistent on linguistic separation of fear and worship, and the lingo of terror and horror and awe just don't conjure up the right tonal ring in my consciousness of the word. As such, it must be sublime, but in a close, burning, fish wire run too fast for the endorphins, self-administered abortion feel of the phrase, a battlefield little touched by authors that all men fear. Catharsis grounded in the mid-twentieth century, of the sort no white person can grasp.\nSo tall, these trees, firm and impossible. They look as though they have been built by hand to carry improper histories.\nAnyone who takes potshots at this for the plot obviously had no idea what they were doing when they read Romeo and Juliet. Soap opera, little children, all this quick and easy self-defense blown apart when Eros and Thanatos refuse to stop fucking for the sake of your comfort zone. A shot in the dark, a boiling pot in the air, seventeen men hung from a tree and all the universal tones of a white world rendered useless when sidewalks are anathema and asbestos is acknowledged without flinching. The lack of tetanus shot's a drag, but so is the centuries-long equating of sanitation to genocide. It's not that you couldn't analyze this text without considering the politics of women and fertility and skin color and the social euthanasia that is that idol of capitalism, but that there is no literary surgeon skilled enough to trap the benign bits in a vat and leave every last measure of metastasis behind. To all those whose first instinct in reading is to sidestep corruption: you're out of your league here.\nBlack wood in a flood moving in full circles. If there is a shore along this river it is not yet a shelter but something hostile. It is an unknown possession. An obstacle against which the bodies are blindly thrust, and thrust again. Wood floats on water: blazes in flame.\nI'll never become used to mourning writers.\nDesire is for the slow examining of wounds."}, {"userName": "Bjorn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19667916-bjorn", "userReview": "When I read \nUnder the Tongue\n a bunch of years ago I couldn't quite get into it. Whether it was the book or me, or both, I don't know; but Vera's writing is very busy, the kind that in a lesser writer would reek of thesaurus overuse. and at that moment I didn't quite think the payoff was worth the effort I had to make to piece it together. This time, something clicked. Which isn't to say that Butterfly Burning is straight-forward. Here's some builders at work:We are here. This is said urgently and with wisdom. We are here. The here of it and the now of it make the honey. Rocking and touching, each man holds on to the word the other has offered and each word raises the moment. The birth of a word, violent, mute. They are pitched against an opposite world so they plunge and pull....and so on and so forth. But yes, when you hit that sweet spot between understanding and absorbing, it's often brilliant. It's all in the way that Vera comes at her story; not as particles but as wave forms, oscillations on themes that build both the characters and the plot up rather than starting with the outline and digging in. It's like being caught up in a swirl of pointillist influences, where layers and transparent layers of story are all visible at the same time, as her characters fight to find a fixed point to hold on to or push off from, only to occasionally throw in an unstoppable physical FACT where the characters and the plot can't get through, have to bounce and eddy around. Like that masterful ending of chapter two, where the swirl of half-told details gets jerked awake by a passing car. It's a clich\u00e9 for a reason, could be anywhere, just happens to be 1940s Rhodesia.It's set 50 years before it was written, in the \"safe\" past of apartheid - \"safe\" in the sense that everyone in it is dead, historians and politicians have drawn a line and accounted for it. Soldiers have come home from fighting a war they lost even when they won, stores have started selling plastic and skin lightening creams, people have started taking English names as soon as they reach the city and settled into asbestos shantytowns. Fumbatha never knew his father, he was hung by the British before he was born, he's born up against a wall; Phephelaphi is younger, she wants to try and be something more than just his girlfriend, a new concept - word is they may let blacks get actual professions soon! Vera coaxes out her characters, carefully, with an archaeologist's brush uncovering every little detail slowly, almost as if she wants to protect them from what's already happened. She has to expose them to do this, so she does it gently.Butterfly Burning is ridiculously beautiful, even when it gives me a headache. Or heartache. Either works. Sensual, harsh, endlessly detailed from a distance where she never lets you step back and look at it at a safe distance."}, {"userName": "Zozetta", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27537517-zozetta", "userReview": "3,8/5\u039c\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03b5\u03c5\u03c7\u03ac\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03ad\u03ba\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03be\u03b7 \u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1. \u03a4\u03bf \u03bf\u03c0\u03b9\u03c3\u03b8\u03cc\u03c6\u03c5\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf \u03b1\u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03b5\u03af \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 (\u03b7 \u03b5\u03bb\u03bb\u03b7\u03bd\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae \u03ad\u03ba\u03b4\u03bf\u03c3\u03b7) \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1\u03c4\u03af \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c9 \u03b1\u03c0\u03cc \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b9\u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03c1\u03af\u03b1 \u03b1\u03b3\u03ac\u03c0\u03b7\u03c2.\u0395\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9\u03b3\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03cc\u03c2 \u03b5\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03bd\u03c9\u03bd \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b4\u03ad\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u03b9 \u0391\u03c6\u03c1\u03b9\u03ba\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u03af \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b3\u03b7, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c6\u03cd\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03b6\u03c9\u03ae \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b8\u03ac\u03bd\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1.\"\u039f \u03c7\u03c1\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03ba\u03cc\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2, \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03bf\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03c0\u03ac\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03b9. \u0394\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03b5\u03cd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c7\u03c9\u03c1\u03af\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9, \u03c3\u03b5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b9\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03c2 \u03b1\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03af\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c0\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2, \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ae \u03bc\u03b9\u03b1\u03c2 \u03ad\u03ba\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03be\u03b7\u03c2, \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b5\u03be\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd \u03c4\u03b7 \u03bc\u03bf\u03af\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c5\u03c4\u03c5\u03c7\u03af\u03b1.\"\u0395\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b7 \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03b9\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1, \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b4\u03c1\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7 \u03b4\u03b5\u03ba\u03b1\u03b5\u03c4\u03af\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 '40, \u03b7 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b4\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1, \u03b7 \u03c0\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1, \u03bf\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u03b7 \u03b5\u03ba\u03bc\u03b5\u03c4\u03ac\u03bb\u03bb\u03b5\u03c5\u03c3\u03b7, \u03bf \u03c0\u03cc\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2. \"\u039f\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9 \u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03b3\u03b9\u03b1 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03b4\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03bf. \u03a4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03cc\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1, \u03c4\u03b1 \u03c7\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03c1\u03ad\u03bc\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03bf\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03bc\u03ac\u03c7\u03b9. \u03a4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03ac\u03c7\u03c4\u03c5\u03bb\u03b1 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03b4\u03b9\u03ce\u03bd \u03b3\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03c9 \u03bb\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03ce\u03bc\u03b1 \u03b5\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03bc\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03bd\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ac\u03bb\u03bc\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7 \u03c3\u03c9\u03c4\u03b7\u03c1\u03af\u03b1. \u039f\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03cd\u03c3\u03b5\u03c2 \u03ba\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c3\u03b1\u03bd \u03b3\u03c1\u03bf\u03b8\u03b9\u03ad\u03c2. \u03a0\u03b1\u03b3\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9.

I gave this novel four stars at first but then reduced it to three because I like the novel's use of poetic language and love story, but I was not enthusiastic overall about the characters. The setting of the story is the black township of Makokoba during the 1940s. The two main characters are Fumbatha, a middle aged man who lost his father at an early age. He seems to view life and all the oppression in it disinterestedly, just going through the motions, until he meets a pretty and lively young girl named Phephelaphi. Phephelaphi too has faced tragedy at an early age. She lost the only parent she knew, her mother, to murder. But unlike Fumbatha, she has not allowed life to get her down. She still hopes for and looks out for many possibilities. It is love at first sight for these two, but as time goes on secrets and betrayal takes a toll on the relationship. Some of this novel would be a slow go for those who don't care much for poetry. I recommend it for people who love stories set in Africa, enjoy love stories, and poetic language."}, {"userName": "Han", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5642530-han", "userReview": "This novel is like one long poem, complete with lyricism, metaphors, and all those other lovely components of poetry. At times, the resulting effect was brilliant and powerful. But at other times, the intricate language felt too complicated and unnecessary, causing me to lose any connection with the characters. Also, the first half of the book was almost unbearably slow, compared to the second half, during which all of the major action seemed to happen all at once.

The language was too flowery and descriptions were too lengthy and repetitive. Often the writer would spend pages just describing the scenery that we would be completely taken away from the story. I think this would have fared better as poetry. There was so much focus on creating imagery rather than creating a story that flowed.

I would even make the argument that Vera's prose has more in common with poetry than the novel form. As an African female post-colonial writer, one of her primary concerns is to dismantle the African-male literary tradition and critique colonial history. Her radical literary aesthetic promotes a powerful feminist perspective that has been silenced by both colonialism and patriarchial power structures.

I've never read a book that combines such poetic eloquence with sentences that I find so irritating or metaphors that I think fall flat. At times it reads to me that she is just trying too damn hard. In some ways it is the opposite of Gilead in that I'm constantly aware of Yvonne Vera crafting each sentence as I read them.Take the following passage, from early on (page 35) when Vera first describes the death of Phephelaphi's mother.\"Still, she thought someone would come to invite her for the burial of her mother. She waited inside the house. After seven days she knew that this would not be so. Seven days is a long time. A long time lasts less than seven days. A moment is an eternity. The worst theft leaves you barren, the best lightens your burden.\"OK, I'm really into it. She is building momentum by relating the narrative fairly straightforwardly in the immediately preceeding passage. She has a nice rhythm going. She then nails it with the climax: \"After seven days she knew that this would not be so. Seven days is a long time. A long time lasts less than seven days.\" The first sentence ends the straightforward narrative. Then the next two sentences are perfect. They are all that is needed to make the point.Even though I read this in a crowded and crazed subway car in Seoul I felt the loneliness and the idea of time just dripping away for seven long days.Then she has to write \"A moment is an eternity.\"We all know that. Why is she resorting to cliche?Then she tacks on \"The worst theft leaves you barren, the best lightnes your burden.\"Well, true. But why is this here? It just serves to ruin the flow that she had developed.I definitely found it worth reading. But a masterpiece it sadly isn't."}, {"userName": "Sandra Chavez", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2939098-sandra-chavez", "userReview": "The novel, Butterfly Burning by Yvonne Vera, is about a young woman living in Sidojiwe E2, Makokoba, Bulawoyo. It starts off with describing how the plot is. It talks about how they live in that little section of the small town. It is an underdeveloped place where everyone knows each other. The story is about a young woman named Phephelaphi. About her struggles as they come. It is talking about the situations and how she handles them.\tShe lives in a room with her boyfriend, Fumbatha. The room is all they have. Everyone is that town just has one room. The town is so poor, that is all they have, \u201cOne room. Solid brick walls. Asbestos and cement\u201d (47).\tThere are so many metaphors in this book. I get the feeling that the whole book is written almost like a poem. I would say the book\u2019s genre is realistic fiction with a poetic twist, almost like Shakespeare\u2019s work. Because the book is written almost like a poem, it uses strange ways of describing things. When Phephelaphis wants to die, she makes me think of death as a beautiful way. I have never thought of dying in a pleasant way before I read this book, \u201cI see myself die in a storm. A storm has amazing sounds, beautiful, like eggshells crushed between palms only louder\u201d (146).\tAlthough it was hard to get interested in the book, I ended up liking it. The part I liked the most was the end. Not because it ended, but because she ends up loving herself, and accepts everything in the end."}, {"userName": "Lindsey Z", "userReviewDate": "Sep 30, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1712562-lindsey-z", "userReview": "Yvonne Vera is one of the most amazing writers I have ever read. I am writing my Masters thesis about her works.I cannot explain Vera's writing style except to declare that she has a gift with words unlike anyone else. Her stories are dark and probing. They unveil the effects of violence on women in a postcolonial setting. She blows me away.In Butterfly Burning, Pheephelaphi, the main character, struggles with the memory of her mother's death when she meets Fumbatha and he saves her. She has higher dreams, however, that do not include him- to become a nurse. She is accepted into the nursing program, but she finds herself pregnant. The scene in which she performs an abortion on herself with a jagged piece of glass from her broken window is breathtaking. The scene in which she lights herself on fire commiting suicide in the end is unexplainable.
