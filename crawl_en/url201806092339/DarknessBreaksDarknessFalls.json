It was full of action, suspense and emotion\u2019s are all over the place.\nThis one really tugs at your heart strings. The relationship with Kayla and Sylas has grown, and some of those walls Sylas has built up have come down. The way he really feels is shown to us, and Kayla. She also gets some important memories back, and a whole new batch of questions arise.Tristen shows up in this one, to kill Kayla, and Sylas saves her life on more than one occasion, and she saves his back. She makes some big sacrifices and choices that had to be hard, and really makes you feel what she is going through. I used to be a huge Aiden fan, but after this book, I think I go to Sylas side now. The ending is a huge cliffhanger, and I really hate that I have to wait to find out what happens next, lol. It\u2019s got some sad parts too, had me in tears.This Book is a great follow-up to the first one Darkness Breaks. I anxiously wait for the 3rd.If you have not read any in this new series from Jessica Sorensen, you really should give it a try. Make sure to read Darkness Falls then this one Darkness Breaks (Darkness Falls Book 2)Check out my blog for more reviews and extras"}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4936267-natalie", "userReview": "[When they meet up, Aiden locks her up again and nearly gets all of them killed.

Continuing immediately after Darkness Falls, Kayla continues to struggle with her new 'humanity'. Once a powerful Bellator, Kayla is barely able to hold her own against the zombie-like vampires roaming the ash-laden and fire-ravaged city. Without the daily injections that make her stronger and faster, Kayla must consider whether to become a Day-Taker like Sylas or risk losing everyone she once loved to the mutant strain of vampire virus. As the ONE who will be humanity's savior, Kayla knows that there is only one option. And the once feared Highers will reveal themselves to be a bigger threat than anyone had thought possible.Sylas and Kayla continue their nightly hunts, and only Kayla remains impervious to the vampire virus. But years of captivity and experiments have left Kayla without her memories and no one is willing to help her regain them back. Imprisoned against their will as children, Kayla, Sylas and his brother Aiden, as well as numerous other children, were subjected to daily injections and training in order to determine who was capable of saving the world. Without their special abilities,the children were eventually eradicated and their whereabouts unknown. And to complicate matters, many do not know if their special abilities and affinities were manufactured by the doctors at the Colony, or part of their own DNA. And once outside the Colony, the lies will continue to perpetuate the cycle of abuse.Outside of the Colony, Kayla must face those who were once her friends and are now considered the enemy, but many of these former captives, hold the secrets to Kayla's memories. Ryder holds the 'key' to Kayla's past, but Aiden holds the memories that the key will unlock: young Emmy can help bring forward the past, but Maci sees a future that continues to change. Sylas has the ability to manipulate emotions, but in truth he says he can never lie. And where does that leave Kayla? These people must survive if Kayla is ever able to regain her past. The memories that come unbidden will show that there was something behind the Red Door and Cell 7 was the place where everything began.As a Day Taker, Sylas is a hybrid of sorts-half human/half vampire with the ability to stay awake during the daylight hours, and this will ensure Kayla has someone to keep watch while she battles the unknown. But Sylas and Kayla will encounter a new-hybrid that will threaten their safety once again. Only this time, the experiment has gone totally wrong. And for Kayla to survive she must become the very thing she was programmed to destroy.There is a love triangle between Kayla, Sylas and Aiden, and Kayla's memories will slowly reveal that she was close to both young men throughout most of her life and now Kayla's humanity remains in question when Sylas and Aiden are a different ends of the spectrum. One wants her to remain human while the other demands she take the next step. Tristan returns but his intentions towards Kayla add to an otherwise tense situationand it is revealed, that Tristan is not the same boy that Kayla once loved at the Colony. But where Kayla is concerned, nothing will ever be simple and in the end, there will be another form of hybrid, that is impervious to the vampire virus and is able to walk in the sun. And the virus? What will be revealed behind Cell7 and the Red Door is a struggle for perfection that went horribly wrong.DARKNESS BREAKS is a vampire tale with a twist. These are not your beautiful, sexy vampires, but are the rotting, life-destroying creatures of your worst nightmare. The small group of friends will lose a member while another's fate is unknown. Lies and betrayal will build walls that will be difficult to tear down but there is still the hope that one young girl will be the savior that either saves the world or tears it completely down. Darkness Breaks is fast paced, well written and finishes with a cliff hanger, that like the characters will keep you wondering what was a lie and what was the truth.Copy supplied by author.see all of my reviews at : thereadingcafe.com"}, {"userName": "Nancy (The Avid Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7149266-nancy-the-avid-reader", "userReview": "Kayla leaves Aiden's little group to go stay with Sylas' and his group the Day Takers. Day Takers are vampires that can be out in the daytime, they just have to stay covered up. Kayla needs the help of Emmy a Day Taker to get her memories back. But Kayla finds out that she doesn't have all of her memories in her own head. Some of her memories are in Aiden's head. She will have to go see Aiden to get her memories back with Ryder's help this time.Kayla has to find the cure for the virus that turned everyone into vampires. When she gets some of her memories back she remembers about a place that is called Cell 7. She believes that Cell 7 has all the answers to finding the cure for the virus. But getting to Cell 7 will be a perilous journey thru a city filled with vampires. Being human makes a trip thru the city harder for Kayla than if she was a Day Taker.Sylas and Kayla are growing closer together. Their feelings for each other are becoming stronger. Kayla still thinks about Aiden and cares about him a lot. Aiden only wants to take care of Kayla and make sure that she is safe. Sylas is very straight up with Kayla he won't lie to her. Sylas wants Kayla to become a Day Taker but Aiden wants her to stay human. Sylas believes being a Day Taker is the only way to survive. Kayla is not sure that she wants to be a Day Taker, at least until she finds the cure.The Darkness Falls Series is one of the best stories of vampires that I think I have ever read. The vampires are very different from vampires in most other stories. Most of the other vampire books they are very hot and sexy but not these. They are ugly and gross more like zombies in a post-apocalyptic world. Usually it is zombies in post-apocalyptic world and not vampires. I am eagerly awaiting the arrival of Darkness Fades the 3rd book in the series. Hopefuly with Darkness Fades we will find out how the virus started and if they can cure it or at least prevent it from happening again.I received a copy of Darkness Breaks (Darkness Falls #2) by Jessica Sorensen from the author for review."}, {"userName": "Delphina", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7166602-delphina", "userReview": "I am so loving this series. I was beyond happy when book two came out so close to the release of book one. Now if only book three could come out tomorrow ;). This YA series is sort of both paranormal and science fiction and it simply had me at the edge of my seat. Here are some of the things I liked about this book (this may be spoilerish if you have not read book one):*I love how Jessica reveals the mystery through snippets of Kayla's memory as she gets it back. I feel like I am discovering things right along with her.*There is a definite darkness to this world and Jessica does not shy away from it just because she has a YA audience. As in her Fallen Star series, she explores the idea that some consider emotions as a detriment and how that impacts all involved.*I still do not know who is going to ultimately be \"the bad guy\" and who are their pawns. There are so many ideas about this floating in my head. I love it when a novel can make me think about it even after I have already started another book. *The dynamics between Aiden, Sylas, and Kayla are very fascinating to watch, especially as memories unfold.*I love how this book did not begin by rehashing everything that happened in book one. The author gives the reader credit for remembering the main ideas and I was able to jump right into the story.*Very rarely do I even think about books becoming movies. I tend to think I imagine it better than any producer. This series, however, I think would be amazing on the big screen. I think the feel of the world mixed with the action and the flashbacks could be magnificent on screen. I was very sad when I got to the end of this book because when I went to see when the next one would be available, it said Fall 2012 and I do not want to wait that long. I would not recommend this book if you have not read Darkness Falls. While you could probably fill in the gaps and make it to the end of the book with some understanding, I think you would miss too much to really get the full enjoyment out of it."}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8999866-rachel", "userReview": "Having got the first book very cheaply, I bought the second one because I was engrossed in the story and had to find out what happened. However, I'm only giving this book 2 stars because the way it is written is so annoying. Not only does the author use the irritating present tense style that I really hate (but I appreciate that is specific to me, and that a lot of readers would not mind), but it also uses language in a really weird way. For example, the sentence \"Fear escalated the room\" almost makes sense, but just sounds weird to me! (And there are many more similar examples.) I know authors don't always have to stick to strict grammar rules and can (and should) play with language in order to create certain effects, but this was certainly not achieved in this book. Honestly, in some places it felt like the author had never actually read the book back to check how it sounded.Having said that, the plot is intricate and interesting. The process of gradually revealing memories throughout the book (as with the first book) is great for building tension and for allowing the reader to gradually build a picture. The only plot complaint that I have is that I still have no idea what's going on, and I keep losing track of what's happened in previous memories, owing to having left a gap between reading the first and second books. What's more, I have to buy a third book before I can find out what's going on for sure. I really really hope there isn't a fourth one! I'm still debating whether or not I'm going to buy the third one, since I found the writing style in this one so infuriating."}, {"userName": "Sadie Forsythe", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5634574-sadie-forsythe", "userReview": "Darkness Breaks picks up just after Darkness Falls ends and is worth reading for Sylas alone. I adored him and am keeping my fingers crossed for his speedy return in book three (Darkness Fades). I found the juxtaposition of him and Aiden interesting. While one openly declares himself evil and the other tries ardently to do the right thing, you are still left wondering which on is really working for the forces of good in the world. Sometimes the 'right' thing isn't always the RIGHT thing to do. It's all yet to be seen though. I think I had as many questions at the end of the book as I did at the beginning.I did start to think that maybe Kayla was a little too perfect. I realise, of course, that she was designed to be that way, but surely she needs a weakness somewhere. Her perfection started to strain the confines of credibility a little. I also started to wonder about the rest of the world. Kayla is on about saving it, but there is no indication beyond assumption that the virus has spread worldwide or that this is the last enclave of humanity. It's just a niggle, but it is there in the back of my mind.I eagerly await the next book in the series.

But there was some things I didn't like, like Aiden. I actually liked Aiden in the first book, but this book he was just so annoying! He was so overprotective, I know he loves her and everything but he needs to chill the flip out. Ryder is another one. God she is so jealous of Kayla. I mean face it Sylas and Aiden don't like you like they like Kayla. And I can totally tell whyOooo but Sylas was swoon worthy in this book. And he actually has feelings! I was soo glad towards the end when Kayla kissed Sylas, I was like \"FINALLY!\" but he's turning into a different species (which kayla has to probablry kill him because of that) and I was about in tears. No he can't turn/die when Kayla finally has him. Ugh super mad about thatI can't wait till the next book comes out and when the other series comes out by Jessica.

I\u2019m not sure whether I read in a ridiculously small font on my iPad or if it\u2019s just a slim novel at 205 pages!). As with the first book, I found that not much happened (except one thing, but I won\u2019t speak of it out of fear that someone is going to complain about spoilers) but the story is paced well enough so that I don\u2019t get irritated by the lack of action. Instead of my usual pros and cons list of what I liked and didn\u2019t like, I\u2019m going to switch it up a bit by discussing the three main characters. KaylaThis is a little bit off topic, and I didn\u2019t even mention it in my review of the first book, but I do appreciate that Jessica Sorenson has put in a woman (or girl?) of colour as the protagonist in her story even if she doesn\u2019t explicitly state Kayla\u2019s race (I\u2019m judging from the book cover here). I also appreciate the fact that Kayla does not spend needless amounts of time talking about her physical appearance in front of a mirror (Does anyone actually just stand in front of a mirror and think of all their facial features in various poetic ways?). As per always, I have difficulties articulating my thoughts on main characters in stories. On one hand, she is unnervingly perfect \u2013 has a few love interests, can kick ass, caring,is destined to be the heroine, courageous, presumably physically attractive etc etc. But then I realise that she isn\u2019t perfect at all.She\u2019s fickle and indecisive, never knowing what (or who) she wants until push comes to shove and she is forced to make a decision. She is also a compulsive liar, but unlike Aiden, her lies are usually to protect herself from others. She also has moments where she knows what she should be feeling, but can\u2019t find it in herself to actually feel it.So through all writing, I think what I\u2019m trying to say is that Kayla is a fairly well rounded character. She has a particular character and traits that belong to her, but she also has an element of unpredictability that makes her interesting. It also helps that she doesn\u2019t suffer from continuous moments of extreme stupidity and illogical choices \u2013 unlike a fair amount of protagonists in other pieces of literature that I shall not mention...SylasSylas Anders is the stereotypical bad boy with a soft gooey center. I know it\u2019s not original characterisation. I know that it\u2019s pretty much the same formula as 80% of YA novels these days (bad boy vs. good guy who just happen to be brothers \u2013 in this book anyway). But there\u2019s just something about him that keeps me coming back. I can\u2019t hate him even if he ticks off a lengthy list of clich\u00e9s. I can\u2019t get myself to dislike him when he\u2019s so deliciously snarky and sarcastic but so truthsworthy at the same time (as opposed to his brother\u2026). So A+ for you Sylas and I hope you don't die.AidenWhen I first started this series, I thought that Kayla and Aiden were going to be the end game. Like Robin and Barney in \u2018How I Met Your Mother\u2019, I immediately thought that this was where it was going to go. That no matter how many potential love interests were thrown in, Aiden and Kayla would be together in the end.So it comes as a surprise to me when I realise that Aiden and Kayla are not definitely going to end up together, and furthermore, I find myself vehemently denying the future of their relationship. In my first review, I made my distaste for Aiden clear. He\u2019s a liar, liar and if he could actually scrounge around and find a back-up pair of pants in this dystopian world, his pants would surely be on fire. The amount of times he lies to Kayla is ridiculous and if he says he lied \u201cto protect her\u201d one more time, I\u2019m going to *insert empty threat here*. As a character, he\u2019s an empty shell (I\u2019m fairly sure he said he felt \u2018lost without her\u2019, like that\u2019s some definition of love\u2026). There\u2019s no dynamism in his personality, nothing that interests me. The reason I don\u2019t like him has nothing to do with me not liking the good guys (For example, Jem Carstairs from \u2018The Infernal Devices\u2019 is one of my greatest fictional loves and he\u2019s epitome of \u2018good guy\u2019!), but it rather stems from the fact that he is bland, boring and quite frankly \u2013 a little useless. So even though I still have some mixed emotions about the series, I\u2019m anticipating the next installment that\u2019s out in September 30. Hopefully, it answers all the questions I've been wondering and surprises me!

No one can pull me out of a reading slump like Jessica can. Her writing is detailed, suspenseful, addictive and you can see in her books that she is a true story teller.As for Darkness Breaks, we continue the story of Kayla and her journey to save the world from what it has become. A world which is full of rotting vampire's hungry for blood and Higher's who control pretty much everyone and everything. As for Kayla, all she knows is that Monarch has a plan for her, a plan that will save the world and with no memory of the plan. Kayla knows its now up to her to figure out what that plan is and first she needs her memory back. So Kayla leaves Aiden and the other humans at their hideaway and is now with Sylas and the other Day Takers, hiding away in the city, trying to put the pieces back together as her memories resurface with the help from a day taker and a syringe full of liquid. But nothing is ever that easy, as Kayla is about to learn.What I loved most about Darkness Breaks, was the characters. Jessica makes each character stand out with strong personality's that you love to love or you love to hate. Another thing I loved was the action, the never ending twists and turns the character's seems to go though during the book. As for the love triangle between Kayla and the 2 brothers Aiden and Sylas. Which I am betting on Sylas winning Kayla's heart. Aiden, had me superstitious in book 1. In book 2, I now don't trust him as far as I can kick him (which isn't far at all). Sylas on the other hand is the total opposite of Aiden and I believe Sylas every time when he tells Kayla 'I don't lie, that's what my brother does\".Darkness Breaks is a great follow-up to Darkness Falls and I feel that it may even be one of the best vampire/post apocalyptic books I have read this year. The characters, are a joy to read, Jessica's writing will keep any reader on the edge of their seat from start to finish and leave you hanging with her signature cliff hanger ending. So I proudly give Darkness Breaks (Darkness Falls - Book #2) by Jessica Sorensen a 5 STAR REVIEW and I am eagerly awaiting for the book release of Darkness Fades the 3rd book in the series.

I was immediately thrown back into the action and questions from the end of the first book were established again within the first few pages, so it was easy to get right back into the heart of the story. Sorensen is an amazing storyteller and her ability to mix glimpses of the past with the fast moving action of the present if truly remarkable, she uses every word carefully, never wasting a moment and each chapter propels the story forward.The thing I loved the most about this book? Sylas. If you know the series then you know we meet him briefly towards the end of the first book. From the first glimpse I knew I wouldn\u2019t be satisfied until I knew everything there was to know about him and although I still have a hundred more questions I haven\u2019t been disappointed. It is great to see the relationship between Sylas and Kayla develop and some of his walls begin to come down but what surprised me the most was that when Kayla\u2019s memories begin to resurface it\u2019s more about Sylas than Aiden despite what Aiden\u2019s had her believe from the beginning.I was surprised to find that my opinion of Aiden changed completely in this book, originally I thought he was sweet if not a bit too sensitive but now I have this sense that there\u2019s more he\u2019s hiding from Kayla and his treatment of her is starting to grate on me. It\u2019s one of the things I don\u2019t understand about her, she is a strong independent woman and yet she still allows Aiden to put her in a position that delays her in completing her task. The one question I want answered about him, why doesn\u2019t he want Kayla to change the world? I was also glad to have more of an insight into Ryder and her true feelings towards the brothers, I never expected to find out that she was a key player in the story and that\u2019s what I love about Sorensen, she never fails to surprise me. I can\u2019t wait to read the next book because I\u2019m hoping there will be a more in depth look into the mind of Monarch and exactly what his plan is and whether he truly has lost all of his humanity, I want to know who\u2019s side he\u2019s on and if Kayla will finally accept the truth about him- that he isn\u2019t the person she thought her was.

Wow. With bad boy lines, that 'don't-mine'me-i'll-just-stand-here-looking-good' attitude and his silent love for Kayla, Sylas overpowers Aiden's romantic actions in book 1.

The best I can do is a measly Karate-Kid impersonation, with one leg kicking a pillow. Kayla kicks vamps and breaks down doors. I feel so...unaccomplished!) earn her my respect.

This book takes off loaded with all the questions from it's prequel and launches you into action packed adventure that while it may not answer all of your questions, it certainly answers enough to keep the pages turning at a fast pace! The deeper into the story I got, the more I enjoyed the cross blend of vampire lore and post-apocalyptic distopia. A really interesting twist on how vampires come to be, and how the world changed forever because of it. The heroine of the story reminds me a lot of Remy, from Amanda Hocking's Hollowland. You have to love a leading female that takes charge and can kick some serious butt. Only the difference is, the rotting once-were-humans aren't zombies, they're vampires...and Kayla, well she's not exactly human herself. The abilities of all of the characters is really intriguing, and how they were created is one of the biggest questions I have, which definitely had me engrossed in every word about Cell 7. Of course there is the necessary love triangle and oddly enough I can't decide who I like more. Truly, in the first book, my lot was in with Aiden, but the more I get to know Sylas, the more I like. It seems Kayla is as torn as well. I'm excited to continue with this series and can't wait for the 3rd book's release."}, {"userName": "Claudiu", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8745692-claudiu", "userReview": "Well,this 2nd book it's even better than the first one.I mean,that in this one,the characters are more highlighted.The first book ends up with Kayla's decision to walk with the Day Takers,which means staying with Sylas.But Aiden it's not forgotten,Kayla still doesn't know if she loves more Sylas or Aiden,it's kind a funny story,this is a vicious circle - Kayla-Aiden-Sylas due the fact that the both brothers have feelings for Kayla.Kayla starts to remember things about a place called Cell 7,the place where all had started,where the virus was created,and something about a red door.With Aiden,Sylas,Maci and the others they try to find out the thruth.We still have the vampire battles that seems never end,Kayla's special abilities during the battles are almost gone now,but soon a change will be made,and things will be different from this point of view.Kayla and the others found a map that leads them to the Cell 7 and Kayla will go in search of it with Sylas.Since now the whole action blows up,i can't say anything more,but Monarch will be there and things will become nasty.In the 3rd book called Darkness Fades we'll find out if Kayla can save the world by finding the cure.I can't wait for this final book,i want to know how the things will end up,and who will be the lucky \"winner\" between Sylas and Aiden :)"}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15307591-jamie", "userReview": "All I can say is wow. I read the first one which was free and was instantly sucked in. I think the first book had one of the best opening lines ever but as much as I liked the first book and expected the second one to be just as good I was completely blown away. The second book was just so awesome and even better than the first. You get to find out a little bit more about what all is going on. The characters continue to grow and change in so many amazing ways. I honestly don't get how books like Maze Runner can be in every freaking store and on the NY Times bestsellers list while a truly great book like this isn't. Darkness Falls 1 and 2 deserve to be in every book store, Walmart, etc that is around. Not only are the chracters so much more believable but the storyline itself is just so much more imaginative. I'm eagerly awaiting the third book and will be buying it the second it comes out. My only complaint is that now I have to wait for the next one. Jessica Sorensen is a very good writer who seems to get better and better as she goes. I'm still amazed at how many mysteries within mysteries are within these books and I'd bet anything the last book is going to totally throw out some stuff that none of us will see coming. I can't wait!!!"}, {"userName": "Shana Rivera", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4750060-shana-rivera", "userReview": "i wish this story was longer, i wanted more from it. i was left very upset. I'm just sick of the whole brother fighting thing. Its too much like Vampire Diaries to me. where the girl ahs to choose btwn the brothers. blah blah blah. i think im the only one who wants her to be with Adien. lmao! i just dont like the other dude. i dont trust him as a reader. i hope he turns and then they kill him off. Like Sorensen's other book (fallen star series) i feel theres TOO much going on and its hard to keep up at some parts. i feel the focus should be on the memories instead of creating new problems. im still trying to figure out the old ones from the 1st book. And Kayla annoys me cuz she keeps leaving adien behind, mind u she needs him and then she keeps going bck. she needs to just convince him to take the medicine so he can help her. it is a great book idea and it makes u want to keep reading for sure. its just little things that make me want to put the book down. like the fighting for the girl brother thing needs to stop. i find myself rolling my eyes everytime i read it. too much like vampire diaries. hope the next one comes out soon :( i hate toooooo waittttt!"}, {"userName": "Lindsay", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6696295-lindsay", "userReview": "This is the second book in this series and it surprises me well. The beginning had me skeptic about what was gong to happen next and I didn't really get into it until mid-way through the book. It has a lot of suspense along with some action. I feel like I should be siding with Aiden in the book to chose humanity but also the same time wanting Kayla to turn over to the day takers so she can kick butt and save the world. Which is what she is suppose to do right? The one thing that made me a little confuse was what if she is being told a lie this whole time. But I guess we will truly find out in the end as the story is continuing. This book ends with a bang and made me sad to put it down, because she has finally found what she is looking for but gets into a bad situation. I liked this one better than the first I have to say. You learned more about the characters and what there purpose in all of this was. The story from the kidnapping to how they were tortured behind the red door really got to me. The story line was great and I love Jessica for creating another book that I could not put down."}, {"userName": "Nereid", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7761984-nereid", "userReview": "The thing about this series is there is always something happening, action packed and Kayla is just trying to survive with the Day Takers. Aden is left behind and she is with Sylas who is holding his memories back from her but she senses that they may have been close at one time. If only she could remember and then she keeps hearing Monarch in her head saying she has to find the cure and save the world - no pressure right. She is getting Emmy to help her recover her memories but it is slow going and then she find out that Aiden has her memories stored inside his head and she needs Ryder's help to recover them. Ryder hates her and Kayla secretly thinks its because Aiden love her but its hard to tell sometimes. Aiden is reluctant to help her as he wants to keep her human and safe yet Sylas is only too willing to go the extra mile and is constantly saving her ass time and time again. It is a strange sort of love triangle as Kayla can't remember her past or how she felt about them once so there is not a conscious choice made to pick one over the other. Lots of action fighting off Vampires and highers and there is a twist coming which I did not see.

This is the 2nd installment in the Darkness Falls series about a character called who has super human powers and can take on vampires and win. Kayla is re united with the friends she left in the previous novel. I have done a review of that novel Darkness Falls. This story is set in the future when there is an epidemic of vampires & society has had to go back to a basic existence. Aidan has been kidnapped by Monarch & it's up to Kayla to rescue him. She and her comrades go into a tunnel and a huge boulder is rolled across blocking the entrance and is too heavy for Kayla to move it. There is a happy ending and Aidan & Kayla kiss for the 1st time. I think it's well written but I think it's not quite as good as Darkness Falls. They find out some vampires can go out during the day. You can find Jessica on twitter at @jessfallenstar. She has written several books series like Fallen Star."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7100100-sara", "userReview": "I really have enjoyed this series by Jessica Sorensen. I think she is an amazing storyteller. These books are about a whole differrent kind of vampire breed, a couple different ones actually. And the story heroine is Kayla, who is on a quest to find a cure for this vampire virus, and get her memories back from all the experimenting that has been going on. Kayla is my favorite type of character, because she is strong and shows no fear in doing what needs to be done. And she has some help along the way from Sylas. I just love Sylas. He can be annoying, but he never lies to Kayla even though he doesn't always say the truth out loud. There is also Aidan, and I am still not sure what all his story is, except that he wants to stay human.The vampires in this story are not good in any way, or gorgeous. They are rather discusting! I cannot wait for the next book, especially since this ended with a little cliffhanger and some sadness."}, {"userName": "BestChickLit.com", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12115057-bestchicklit-com", "userReview": "The action picks up with Kayla having joined the Day Takers, in an attempt to gain access to her missing memories. Becoming more determined by the minute to save the world and return to a \u2018pre-virus\u2019 time, Kayla and Sylas are more in sync and develop a genuine affection for each other, which begs the question of potential romance.

While the 1st book was necessary to set up the main storyline & introduce the reader to the characters, \"Darkness Falls\" (on its own) didn't have me completely invested in the characters yet. Still, it was definitely a unique & intriguing idea for a story, & had enough suspense to hold my interest. LUCKILY, I listened to the Amazon reviews for Book 2, which promised that the 2nd book was even better & more amazing-definitely true!!! \"Darkness Breaks\" has a ton of revelations & memories surfacing, & explains a lot of unanswered questions. Revealing more of the characters' backgrounds made the plot even more twisted & unique! I LOVE Kayla & Sylas...they truly made this book absolutely un-putdownable!
