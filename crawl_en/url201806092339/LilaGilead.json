It\u2019s hard to imagine those accolades meant much to the Midwestern Calvinist, but four years later she published a companion novel called \u201cHome,\u201d which won the Orange Prize and more enthusiastic praise. And now comes \u201cLila,\u201d already longlisted for the National Book Award, involving the same few people in Gilead, Iowa, \u201cthe kind of town where dogs slept in the road.\u201dThese three exquisite books constitute a trilogy on spiritual redemption unlike anything else in American literature. (Our Puritan forefathers wrote and worried plenty about salvation, but they had no use for novels.) In a way that few novelists have attempted and at which fewer have succeeded, Robinson writes about Christian ministers and faith and even theology, and yet her books demand no orthodoxy except a willingness to think deeply about the inscrutable problem of being. Her characters anticipate the glory beyond, but they also know the valley of the shadow of death (and they can name that Psalm, too). In \u201cHome,\u201d the Rev. Robert Boughton struggles to save his wayward son from drinking himself into the ground. In \u201cGilead,\u201d the Rev. John Ames, with just a few months to live, races to compose a long letter about his life before he\u2019s carried away to imperishability. And in this new novel, we\u2019re finally, fully engaged with Lila, the unlikely young woman who marries Rev. Ames late in life and gives him a son when he feels as old as Abraham.The geography and the cast of characters are mostly familiar, but this time around we\u2019re entering a wholly different spirit. Boughton\u2019s alcoholic son may have been lost, but he knew the terms of perdition and could torment his father and Ames in a language they all spoke. Lila crawls into Gilead from another world altogether, a realm of subsistence living where the speculations of theologians are as far away \u2014 and useless \u2014 as the stars.The novel opens in a fog of misery. Lila is just 4 or 5, sickly, dressed in rags, when a woman named Doll steals her from her violent home. \u201cDoll may have been the loneliest woman in the world,\u201d Robinson writes, \u201cand she was the loneliest child, and there they were, the two of them together, keeping each other warm in the rain.\u201d They survive by joining up with a tough band of migrants looking for work as the country slides further into the Depression. It\u2019s a vision of failing America somewhere between \u201cThe Grapes of Wrath\u201d and \u201cThe Road\u201d \u2014 poverty grinding away every element of pride until the group fractures under the strain. Robinson has constructed this novel in a graceful swirl of time, constantly moving back to Lila and Doll\u2019s struggles with starvation, desperate thieves and vengeful relatives. We see that dark past only intermittently, as a child\u2019s clear but fragmentary memories or a trauma victim\u2019s flashbacks.In the novel\u2019s present, Lila, now an adult, almost feral with fear and apprehension, wanders into Ames\u2019s church. In that moment, the old pastor dares to imagine he might be allowed to fall in love again. But Lila is not easily or quickly drawn away from the life she knew. \u201cHappiness was strange to her,\u201d Robinson writes. \u201cWhen you\u2019re scalded, touch hurts, it makes no difference if it\u2019s kindly meant.\u201dThis may be the most tentative, formal and charming romance you\u2019ll ever encounter. Ames, who assumed his years of loneliness would never end, floats off the ground in a state of anxious delight, always preparing himself for the day when Lila will run back out of his life. And everything about the reverend baffles her. \u201cYou\u2019re just the strangest man,\u201d she tells him when she knows she\u2019s \u201chorribly in love.\u201d There seems no end to his concerns, his senseless courtesies. \u201cHe always helped her with her chair,\u201d she thinks, \u201cwhich amounted to pulling it out from the table a little, then pushing it in again after she sat down. Who in the world could need help with a chair?\u201d He and his friends talk about people she doesn\u2019t know and things she doesn\u2019t understand. His constant allusions to the Bible \u2014 that old book \u2014 mean nothing to her. She can\u2019t get over how enthusiastically his congregation sings \u201csongs to somebody who had lived and died like anybody else.\u201dAnd yet she considers the reverend\u2019s theological arguments with dead seriousness. Robinson, for all her philosophical brilliance, captures clearly and without a trace of condescension the mind of an uneducated woman struggling to comprehend why things happen, what our lives mean. \u201cShe knew a little bit about existence,\u201d Robinson writes in this miraculous voice that somehow blends with Lila\u2019s. \u201cThat was pretty well the only thing she knew about, and she had learned the word for it from him.\u201d Lila doesn\u2019t have the luxury of speculating about the possibility of hell; she\u2019s lived there. \u201cShe had thought a thousand times about the ferociousness of things so that it might not surprise her entirely when it showed itself again.\u201d The Bible is a revelation to her \u2014 though not in the way it is to her husband: \u201cShe never expected to find so many things she already knew about written down in a book.\u201d The images of desolation and abandonment in Ezekiel don\u2019t sound to her like history or metaphor \u2014 they sound like yesterday. Job could easily have been someone she knew on the road. When Boughton refers to the elect and the damned, Lila fears she may never see Doll again, and wonders if heaven is worth that sacrifice. How is it, she wonders, that these men can worship a God willing to send so many fine people to hell?\u201cYou ask such interesting questions,\u201d Ames says.\u201cAnd you don\u2019t answer \u2018em,\u201d Lila shoots back. She\u2019s been trained by years of violence and hardship not to trust anyone, but \u201che was beautiful, gentle and solid, his voice so mild when he spoke, his hair so silvery white.\u201d Can she, dare she, give up the clarity of her old life for this gracious man who loves her past all reason? She knows it\u2019ll only be a matter of time before she shocks \u201call the sweetness right out of him.\u201d\u201cAre we getting married, or not?\u201d Ames asks her early in the novel.\u201cIf you want to, it\u2019s all right with me, I suppose. But I can\u2019t see how it\u2019s going to work,\u201d Lila says. \u201cI can\u2019t stay nowhere. I can\u2019t get a minute of rest.\u201d\u201cWell, if that\u2019s how it is, I guess you\u2019d better put your head on my shoulder.\u201dFor all the despair and trauma that haunt Lila, her story is one of unimaginable, sudden good fortune that only her husband\u2019s patience can coax her into accepting. \u201cI can\u2019t love you as much as I love you,\u201d Lila says with a paradox worthy of St. Paul. \u201cI can\u2019t feel as happy as I am.\u201d Both of these unlikely lovers have suffered enough \u201cto know that this is grace.\u201dAnyone reading this novel will know that, too.This review first appeared in The Washington Post:http://www.washingtonpost.com/enterta..."}, {"userName": "Candi", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3639005-candi", "userReview": "\"Doll may have been the loneliest woman in the world, and she was the loneliest child, and there they were, the two of them together, keeping each other warm in the rain.\"Lila understands what it means to be lonely. She knows what it means to connect with another human soul to overcome that utter loneliness. Lila takes us on her journey and it is one of beauty and understanding and developing faith, not just in God but in the human spirit itself. Despite hardship and neglect, can a person truly learn to trust another? Ultimately, this is what the heart yearns for and what Lila seeks throughout her life. Lila, born into poverty and neglect, is rescued and raised by an older woman named Doll. It becomes necessary to their survival to lead a life wandering from one place to the next in order to avoid detection. Doll is determined to protect Lila from those that had failed to provide her with the most basic of human needs, including love. The two attach themselves to a band of drifters and lead a harsh life, but one that allows them to form a bond that will always remain within Lila\u2019s heart long after she must strike out on her own. Alone in the world, Lila searches for an identity, she longs for that human connection that sustains her, sustains all of us. Drifting into the small mid-western town of Gilead, the town we encountered in the book of that same title, Lila decides to settle for a bit. \"\u2026 she wanted to stay in one place for a while. The loneliness was bad, but it was better than anything else she could think of. It was probably the loneliness that made her walk the mile or so into town every few days just to look at the houses and stores and the flower gardens. She never meant to talk to anybody.\" Then one day while in town, Lila seeks shelter from the rain and enters the church. Thus begins one of the most beautiful human connections in literature as Lila meets the Reverend John Ames. Lila is full of mistrust towards others. John Ames is gentle and patient and full of wisdom \u2013 wisdom that he doesn\u2019t preach but quietly shares with humility and after much contemplation. He makes no demands. John is not a stranger to loneliness himself and Lila\u2019s recognizes this. \"He looked as if he\u2019d had his share of loneliness, and that was all right. It was one thing she understood about him. She liked his voice. She liked the way he stood next to her as if there was a pleasure for him in it.\" Lila, not formally educated, but with her own brand of intellect based on experience, reasoning and inquisitiveness, will develop a spiritual rapport with John that is moving and simply powerful. This novel, published after Gilead, is set in a time prior to the events occurring in that outstanding work of fiction. While Gilead was told from John\u2019s point of view, Lila is a third person narrative which focuses on Lila\u2019s life. It highlights her own perspective of those events leading up to the time she meets John and their early life together. The story is told with a stream of consciousness feel to it that alternates between past and present. Robinson draws a portrait of Lila that illustrates her past struggles and how these juxtapose with her current attempts to overcome loneliness and mistrust. This is not an easy battle for Lila and we, along with John, are witness to her lapses back to the familiar and painful feelings. \"The problem is, she thought, that if someday she opened the front door and there, where the flower gardens and the fence and the gate ought to be, was that old life, the raggedy meadows and pastures and the cornfields and the orchards, she might just set the child on her hip and walk out into it, the buzz and the smell and the damp of it, the breath of it like her own breath, her own sweat. Stepping back into the loneliness, a dreadful thing, like walking into cold water, waiting for the numbness to set in that was the body taking the care it could, so that what you knew you didn\u2019t have to feel.\"After much reflection, I really must change my rating to 5 stars. This book and the entire trilogy, including Gilead and Home, are definitely worthy of that rating. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Fionnuala", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "What would it be like to have limited vocabulary with which to phrase our thoughts? Would we then have limited thoughts? Or would our thoughts instead be clearer for the lack of words to muddy them?Such are the questions that occur to us as we read this account of a homeless woman called Lila, a woman without a surname or knowledge of what country she lives in - except that it\u2019s good country for growing crops - but who knows perfectly her place in the world nevertheless. A woman unaware of the existence of the concept \u2018existence\u2019 but who still knows more than most about staying alive against the odds, about facing death with equanimity.At the beginning of this book, Lila\u2019s former life of wandering is over. It has come to an end because she stepped inside a church one day to shelter from the rain. The seeking of shelter leads to her choosing a settled life with a man who is particularly full of thoughts and words, thoughts and words being the tools of his trade. John Ames is the elderly pastor of Gilead and he\u2019s a character whom readers of some of Marilynne Robinson\u2019s other books already know. We had already met Lila too but only as a shadowy presence on the edge of every scene in those books. Her former life was hinted at but Robinson cleverly left much of Lila\u2019s story a complete mystery; she clearly had plans for Lila from the beginning.The earlier books each presented different facets of John Ames\u2019 character. In Gilead, which is written in the form of a letter from Ames to his and Lila\u2019s young son we get to know Ames through his memories of his father and grandfather and his own youth and life. The picture that emerges is of a mostly thoughtful and kind man, very committed to his faith, but we remember that this is a first person narrative and we know not to completely trust his account of everything.In Home, we see Ames among his parishioners and friends, in particular the Baughton family who live next door. Home is a third person narrative, mostly from the point of view of Glory, Robert Boughton\u2019s daughter, who cares for her elderly father (this is Mid West America sometime in the 1950s). As we see Ames mingle with the various members of his friend Robert\u2019s large family, we discover different aspects of his personality. In Lila, the other characters fade from the picture and we get a completely fresh angle on John Ames. In the course of this book, the man who has spent his life writing and preaching sermons, advising others how to think and speak, has to learn how to think and speak himself all over again. To understand Lila and to be understood by her, everything he believes in, the way he phrased what he thought he knew, has to be reexamined. It\u2019s rare for me to be truly moved by the words I read. I enjoy words tremendously, I look under them and over them and through them but they rarely cause my eyes to well up with tears. Although Robinson carefully avoids any attempt to trade on the emotional content of her story, the hesitant words that Lila and John Ames exchange as they seek to understand the meaning of the other\u2019s almost unknowable existence moved me intensely.What Robinson has done here is deeply, deeply interesting - not the creation of a love story between a young woman and an elderly man - but the examination from scratch of the meaning of life."}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "This is my third read of Marilynne Robinson and as always a wonderful one. I inadvertently skipped the 2nd volume of the Gilead trilogy (I'll read Home soon) because the American Library had Lola on the shelf. Sort of a deep dive into the Reverend Ames' wife introduced in Gilead, Lila's story is one of profound pain and suffering and, thankfully, redemption. The book takes place as she becomes pregnant with the Reverend's child as she looks back in a sort of stream of conscience on her life and wonders whether she deserves a happy ending. As with all of Robinson's writing, the prose is exquisite and highly figurative. Both the Reverend and Lila struggle with the meaning of evil and pain in the world as Lila teaches herself to read using the \"easy\" books of Ezekiel and Job. Her childhood having been literally stole from her by the mysterious Doll is recounted drip by drip throughout the book. I felt it dragged a little in the middle. Well, put another way, it was sort of a one movement symphony (there are no chapter headings): it starts out in an adagio rythme in a minor key and slows to a lentissimo but about 3/4 of the way in, the pace picks up and the chords change to major keys, sort of like in Beethoven's 6th in the last movement, cumulating in Lola's acceptance of her past and her love for the baby and the Reverend.Lila is always associated with nature, having lived off the land (and her own body) in her survival. Here the orchestra rises towards the denouement.\"Lila was glad to be seeing the country again, the fields looking so green in the evening light. Knee-high by the Fourth of July. So it must be June. Every farmhouse in a cloud of trees. There is a way the trees stir before a rain, as if they already felt the heaviness.\" (P. 213)Here she is running away, but also symbolically coming home on her arc towards Gilead.Later, Lila and the Reverend discuss his Sunday sermon in some of the best Robinson prose I have read so far:\"Life on earth is difficult and grave, and marvelous. Our experience is fragmentary. Its parts don't add up. They don't even belong in the same calculation.\" (P. 223)Lila: \"Near as I can tell, you were wanting to reconcile things by saying they can't be reconciled.\" (P. 224)Herein lies perhaps the core of Lila, some things in life are beyond human comprehension, beyond a religious explanation or humanistic reason. They are just so. To live life with a modicum of sanity and happiness, this must be accepted uncomplainingly and definitively. Just two pages later, Lila is able to say \"I love you\" to the Reverend in her own unique way:\"'No', she said. 'I'm going to have just one husband.' One was more than she'd expected. 'Well, you know, that's good of you to say, but it's not always good to make promises. There can be a lot involved in keeping them than there seems at the time.'She said, 'That's not a promise. It's just a fact.'He laughed, 'Even better.'\" (P. 226)This understated dialog is typical and sparing yet beautiful and about the most sincere that there two lonely people will be able to express themselves to each other.Besides this tear-soaked ending (but warm tears of love and reconciliation, not cold tears of regret), the book also helped me appreciate a few things about how central the church was back in those rural times (the period is never stated but I believe it is between the wars since Lila talks about the Crash). The church was where people experienced music, where they held social events, where they sought answers to their existence long before TV, Twitter and YouTube. And yet, these churchgoers were the same hard working men that came to see Lila in the bordel in Saint Louis (or others like them). This moral ambiguity is a cornerstone of Robinson's depictions of Gilead.Lila was a wonderful read and I look forward to reading Home now which I finally got from the library last week!"}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "The last book in the Gilead trilogy, and the most unconventional because of the choosing of an outcast as a protagonist. Lila is an orphan, hard-edged, uneducated, a creature that survived the rough conditions of her first years against all odds. Shielded by Doll, the enigmatic woman who saved her life as a baby, Lila pushes through in Dickensian conditions; hunger, loneliness and all kind of picaresque penuries paint her unusual story reminding the reader of the most celebrated works by Steinbeck where a constant drip of nomads sprinkled the countryside trying to escape the Great Depression. Lila can\u2019t be defined by social standards; she is a free spirit, a wanderer not bound by the restrictions of propriety or language, she is guided by instinct and mistrust and knows very little of the rituals in communities. So when she appears in John Ames\u2019 church in Gilead on a Sunday morning, wrenched and freezing, it seems exceedingly improbable that the two might bond. And yet they do. This is the magic of this novel; the quiet conversations that transpire between these two essentially different individuals, a religious, highly educated old man and an illiterate young woman whose wisdom comes from the wilderness, the dusty prairies and gushing rivers.Little by little, and avoiding any inkling of romanticism, Lila and Ames knit a complex tapestry of philosophical meditations on guilt, redemption, existence, and love.Even though Lila and Ames had been extremely lonely and locked in themselves in their own way for years when they finally meet, the ability to withstand solitude is precisely what manages to keep them together. Lila embraces Ames\u2019 world and his faith and is therefore \u201csaved\u201d, but she continues fantasizing about the uncertainty of living day to day in the margins of society with no shelter and only the sky and the stars as witnesses to her mute thoughts. I did admire her for remaining her true self in spite of the immersion into Ames' spritual vision.That is the image I want to preserve of this final instalment. Lila\u2019s earthly hymn to geraniums and violets that bloom in the countryside; her clean, plain face washed off misdirected self-punishment, finally learning to trust, finally daring to hope."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "It's 4:30am... I lost a lot of sleep-but just finished the last of this series--a life transforming experience. What to say about Lila? A wild child? Perhaps --but unfortunately-and fortunately I think there are many 'Lila's' in this world. I related to her in many ways myself.The writing once again blew me away - especially fit the emotional key of perfect pitch for me on several occasions. This one small sentence alone is one that brought me to real tears: \"Fear and comfort could be the same\". - For me to explain that might take a lifetime. I loved this book - I loved all the books - don't ask me to pick a favorite- I just don't want to. I could justify reasons for 'favorites' for each one. I absolutely loved John Ames- the old preacher - again - in this novel!!!!! One of the most beautiful moments in this story was when he gave Lila a private baptism out in the sunshine-( he was so tender and sweet)- they walked through a meadow of daisies and sunflowers to pick black raspberries. When he spread his white handkerchief out to put those berries in -and the purple bled through the cloth -- I swear I could smell the fragrance. AS I WRITE THIS... tears come to my eyes.... I'm sad this series is over!!!Marilynne Robinson is a phenomenal writer!!!!!! I had no idea. I feel blessed as can be for having read her books!!!! \"If the world had a soul --that was it--wandering through it. Never knowing anything different or wanting anything more\".

Lila, homeless and alone after years of roaming the countryside, steps inside a small-town Iowa church-the only available shelter from the rain-and ignites a romance and a debate that will reshape her life. She becomes the wife of a minister and widower, John Ames, and begins a new existence while trying to make sense of the days of suffering that preceded her newfound security.Firstly I listened to this book on audio and while the narrator was excellent I found the writing style very repetitive and laboured. The story is told from different perspectives and I found it difficult to follow and the flow too interrupted. There is a very strong religious theme in this novel and it certainly belonged in the stroy but I found it a little much at times and again I think if I had read the book I would have understood it more and perhaps enjoyed it better. I was going to switch to paper format halfways through the stroy but did not love the subject matter enough to purchase another book. I did finish the novel and was glad I struck with it because  the prose is beautiful and poetic but for me this one just didn't float my boat.

How she came to Gilead and married to a preacher is a story that is both poignant and life confirming. She is such a diverse character, wise yet na\u00efve, suspicious yet giving, always thinking and searching for answers.Reading about her young life, her life as a traveler, going wherever Doll, the woman who took her, needed to go in order to find work. Loved the character of Doll, the wise old woman who had such a tough life yet took a little girl in order to save and protect her. Such hard lives, especially during the depression when all work literally dried up, leaving little recourse for, those who lived on the road, going from place to place. Eventually Lila would find her way alone to Gilead, with a past she didn't want to speak of, but thought of often. She would find comfort sitting in the church and would find her way to the scriptures, looking for a reason for her own existence.Loved this story, the writing and descriptions are just beautiful and serve to balance the sometimes ugliness of Lila's journey.

The first seventy or so pages are absolutely ravishing \u2013 beautiful writing, a compelling story and a real sense the author has embarked on a lucid visionary quest. However, then the story lost most of its drive and the theme became a little monosyllabic. Lila, the feral orphan child searching for identity and a sense of belonging, acquires her grace a little too easily, not surprising as throughout she\u2019s surrounded by idealised characters. There\u2019s no evil in Robinson\u2019s landscape, not even of the petty variety which can so try one\u2019s patience and faith. In this sense it\u2019s more of a fable than a novel with archetypes replacing believable human beings. At times I couldn\u2019t help wishing Toni Morrison had written this novel. No one, after all, is better than her at giving the inarticulate an eloquent poetic voice. In Robinson\u2019s hands the embittering experiences of Lila\u2019s youth remain largely cosmetic. The struggle to overcome them no more difficult really than weeding a neglected garden. It\u2019s a heartwarming vision. No doubt about that. And maybe, if you bumped into someone as wholeheartedly benevolent and generous as Lila\u2019s husband such a happy ending might be possible. Gilead, for me, was charged with dramatic tension by the appearance of wanton malevolence into the narrative; Lila, on the other hand, has only her own demons to oppose and they are eliminated with the predictability of ogres falling in fairy stories. The message perhaps take too much precedence over dramatic tension. It is a lovely hopeful message though."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "Some works of fiction are wonderful. They make us laugh, cry, sing. We love their style, their plot, their characters. But, occasionally, a work of fiction steps beyond that and becomes important. It tells us something; something we know but cannot express. It informs us about the human condition, the human spirit, the things that make existence, life itself, worthwhile and meaningful. This is one of those novels. It is one of three, which taken in their totality, are the stuff that true enduring classics are made of.Lila is written in the same kind of stream of consciousness style that we encounter in Gilead. It is Lila\u2019s view of the events that John has already told us about, but expanded and tempered by the addition of Lila\u2019s background story and her own inward tumult. Here is loneliness, in its most cavernous garb, imposed by life experience and then self-imposed for self-protection. Here is longing and loving and fear and need and fright and tenderness and thanksgiving and disbelief and grief and, surely, grace.How can anyone wade in these waters and not come out baptized in the knowledge of what it is to be human? How can Robinson touch on nerves so raw and still show us that there is good in every person if you stop to find it? What if the person who understands life the best is the one who has suffered the most and been offered the least? And, what if things that look horrible on the outside spring from the sweetest of intentions and motivations, or the fate of every individual is tied up in being seen by someone else, when you are invisible to the rest of the world? If these are not the books to read at this time of civil misunderstanding, I cannot think what books would be. This is a portrait of what it is to be the dispossessed and forgotten and what it is to look beneath the surface and discover that we are all fashioned of the same blood and tissue and fear and need.I will be digesting this book and its brothers for a long, long time. I will re-read them soon, because there is no way that you can read them once and absorb everything there is in them that matters. The Pulitzer doesn\u2019t always get it right, but Marilynne Robinson is a writer of such caliber that I cannot doubt they got it right when they handed the prize to her. Goodreads will only let me give these books 5-stars, but they are, for me, what Milton and Pope and Shakespeare are--they are books that will not wear out with time and will have something important to say hundreds of years later."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "I read this in Nov , 2014 and somehow managed to delete my review .

This book has characters that I want to know , a story that made my heart ache and yet lifted my spirit at the same time and writing that is just so good that I didn't want the last page to be the last page.What struck me about Lila was the sadness , the loneliness , the lack of a sense of belonging and her inability to trust anyone.

Practicing her writing and reading from the bible - Ezekiel and Job and asking questions that have no pat answers make for some poignant moments .Yes John Ames is a preacher and they discuss the bible and God but I didn't feel preached to . On one level one could focus on the theology but for me it was just about the basic yet profound questions that Lila asks such as why things happen as they do , questions about existence. I loved John Ames and his quiet ways and how he cared about and for Lila. He too has suffered sadness and loneliness for years .This for me was a love story . It is beautifully written and about more than their spirituality , religion , belief in being saved and the afterlife , it is about their humanity ."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani",

I\u2019ve tried with Marilynne Robinson. I really have. Each time I pick up one of her books I optimistically feel a surge of hope that THIS time I will get it, THIS time I will understand what everyone else raves about, THIS time I will see the light. But no, yet again I am left bemused as to why she is such an acclaimed writer, and yet again I struggle to continue reading. So I won\u2019t attempt a proper review of her latest novel, which is, like her others, being welcomed as another masterpiece by her devoted readership, and just say that I don\u2019t enjoy her writing, I don\u2019t feel empathy for her characters, and I sadly have to accept that Robinson and I just aren\u2019t fated to get on."}, {"userName": "Lynne King", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "This novel is written by a woman who is working at the height of her intellectual and literary powers. I do believe that she is unsurpassed in this novel and that this book, as already mentioned by a reviewer, will prove to be an American classic.Apart from the excellent structure and the mesmerizing prose, religious and spiritual leitmotifs, such as grace, old man, the colour red, and the four elements permeate the text. The word \"grace\" in biblical parlance can, like forgiveness, repentance, regeneration, and salvation, mean something as broad as describing the whole of God's activity toward man or as narrow as describing one segment of that activity. An accurate, common definition describes grace as the unmerited favour of God toward man. But the most remarkable aspect is the skilful way in which the past (Lila\u2019s life with the scarred Doll) and the present (her life with the widower, Reverend John Ames) coalesce and form intricate layers throughout this work.Can you imagine an unnamed, neglected child aged about four or five with rickety legs, thus having difficulty walking, and then tossed out onto the stoop at night by those supposedly taking care of her? Luck however comes the child\u2019s way with Doll, who cleans around the cabin, and hated by the child, and decides on the spur of the moment to steal the toddler. So off they go; the child\u2019s only regret being that she doesn\u2019t have her rag doll with her.The first night they stay with an old woman who decides the child should have a name:I been thinking about \u2018Lila\u2019. I had a sister Lila. Give her a pretty name, maybe she could turn out pretty.Doll never does know why she stole the child and this would remain their secret throughout their itinerant life of many years. Doll and Lila fall in with Doane, a proud man, good at finding work, and feeding his family. These are good and bad times and they are even paid with apples one time which the children sell. Nevertheless, it was a lifestyle for Lila and she doesn\u2019t know any better. In all it is a relatively safe haven with Doane and his family, where Doll and Lila become known as the cow and calf.Doll then decides, wisely, that Lila needs an education and so at the age of twelve she goes to school to learn to read and write. The child is so badly informed about life that she doesn\u2019t even know where she lives in the world, only that it is in the United States of America. But a year later, Doll is on the move again. She\u2019s aware, as she knew would inevitably happen, that people will come looking for Lila. Thus, she carries a knife that she is constantly sharpening and advises Lila to ensure that she never cuts anyone as there could be problems. Indeed, Doll\u2019s fall from grace is rather spectacular and very colourful too.After meeting the preacher at the church for the first time, Lila is aware that he\u2019s looking at her but he actually \u201csees\u201d her and in fact inevitably soon will \u201cknow\u201d her in the biblical sense and I think he realizes at this stage that she will play an important part in his life. Lila starts finding work from people in Gilead and even plants vegetables in the preacher\u2019s garden and tends the roses on his first wife\u2019s and child\u2019s grave. It seems right to Lila to do this. She is drawn to the preacher in an odd way and cannot understand it.Lila doesn\u2019t wish to complain about her life before she meets the preacher, otherwise referred to as the old man. The paradox is that when she marries Rev. Ames and has a comfortable life, she still thinks of the abandoned shack that she stayed in when she first came to Gilead as she feels she is her own person, even though she\u2019s lonely.I have never before come across a character in a novel with whom I could empathize with so totally as Lila. She mistrusts people, even the preacher, often tells him so, even tries to annoy him; in fact she cannot bring herself to say \u201cthank you\u201d and I feel that she even isn\u2019t truly aware she loves John Ames until she is baptized by him.There is very little description about Lila. We know that she doesn\u2019t like to look at her own face, whereas there is more about the preacher. He\u2019s an old man, with silver hair, a beautiful voice, to whom prayer is important and he\u2019s gentle and caring with everyone; he also laughs which I found endearing. He takes nothing for granted and the fact that he loves Lila is a continual joy for him; it\u2019s all part of life\u2019s rich tapestry. He prays for her past and realizes her need to keep the knife as it was part of her history. The pair of them are matched in loneliness which, to their own amazement, turns into love.Lila delights in touching Ames, to enjoy when he helps her on with her coat, his caring way with her, and the way that he looks at her. He still blushes from time to time. She steals his sweater as she wants to be reminded of him. She tells him that he ought to marry her, even surprising herself, and he\u2019s more than happy to agree. On their wedding night she slips quite naturally into bed with him. She does wonder though whether she can become pregnant but this all seems to be part of her learning process. Nevertheless, she always needs to know that she can leave whenever she wants to, and through work by helping people in Gilead, she saves enough money to buy a bus ticket. This was her escape clause and she needs it, married or not.Lila knows so little about life and is still learning (as I am) and then she steals a pew bible from the church (I feel to actually annoy the preacher), purchases a tablet and pencil and begins to read it. She was rather taken with Ezekiel and rewrote sections ten or so times.I\u2019m not really religious. My father was an atheist and didn\u2019t attend my baptism. My mother, of course, had to go. As a result, I didn\u2019t go to Sunday school and was not confirmed. But interestingly enough I loved Religious Instruction whilst at school and I continue to find the bible, especially the Old Testament, a literary masterpiece. There is nothing more enjoyable than browsing through the various Books and Ezekiel happens to be my favourite. So when I came across Ezekiel in the following text, I was enchanted:And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides; and they four had their faces and their wings thus: their wings were joined one to another; they turned not when they went; they went every one straight forward. As for the likeness of their faces, they had the face of a man; and they four had the face of a lion on the right side; and they four had the face of an ox on the left side; they four had also the face of an eagle.Lila is also compassionate as seen when she revisits the shack and finds that someone has been living there. She reminds me of Ruth here from the Old Testament. She also discovers her money has been taken from under the floorboard. When the current occupant, a boy, turns up and tells his sorrowful tale, his belief that he has killed his father and finally admits to finding the money, Lila tells him to keep it but he wants to return half to her. Then circumstances get quite out of control, through the intervention of her husband, as he was worried about her, and his old friend, Rev. Robert Boughton.Such beauty studs this remarkable literary work even when Lila is working in the whore house in St Louis when unfortunate circumstances with Doll force her to leave, resulting in Lila finally ending up in Gilead. She is indeed touched by the hand of grace upon arrival there.I\u2019m so taken with this book I\u2019m having difficulty expressing myself, as Lila also finds. So in conclusion, I can only add that this is the most beautiful and yet haunting novel that I have read for a very long time; the descriptions are excellent and poetic; a mesmerizing tour de force. I cannot stop thinking about the words, their sheer beauty."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5428804-jennifer", "userReview": "Have you ever read a book that was so good it hurt?

They both have a talent for saying important things in understated, familiar ways that make you really FEEL the truth of them. In this book, Lila herself is reading the biblical book of Ezekiel, surprised at how this wild, dangerous poetry rings so true to her. She just \"knows\" the truth of it. That's how I feel, exactly, reading Robinson's trilogy. It is hard to explain how very true it feels.

When Home, the second novel, came out, my answer was almost but not quite. Now with Lila, I have no doubt. This is every bit as rich and self-contained a book as either of its predecessors, a deeply moving meditation on life, love, and God. It is the simplest of the three novels, and the earliest in time, essentially the story of how the elderly preacher John Ames meets and marries his second wife, a former drifter who goes by the name of Lila. But it is also the most complex, weaving past and present, thought and action, together into a multi-layered texture that reminds me strongly of Faulkner\u2014another writer who mined riches from the lives of a few families in a restricted rural location. It is a work of heartbreaking beauty.We meet Lila as a very young child, stolen from a house where she has been neglected and left to die. Her rescuer is a drifter named Doll. She nurses the girl back to health, and joins a small group of other transients, living by doing odd jobs until the Depression and the Dust Bowl force them to split up. At one point, Doll stays put for long enough for Lila to get a year of schooling. It is enough to teach her to read and do arithmetic; she is a very bright student. Somehow, parted from Doll, Lila ends up in Gilead, living in a deserted shack outside the town, and offering gardening and household help to meet her small needs. Before long, she has met John Ames, one of the town's two preachers, an elderly widower. When she calls on him one morning, he offers her coffee, and asks her to tell him a little about herself:\nShe shook her head. \"I don't talk about that. I just been wondering lately why things happen the way they do.\"\"Oh!\" he said. \"Then I'm glad you have some time to spare. I've been wondering about that more or less my whole life.\"\nLila's question and Ames' attempt to answer it form the theological mainspring of the book. For in addition to being a story of two lonely people coming together, this is also a book about religious belief, more explicitly so than either of its predecessors. Those who have read Gilead (though that is not necessary*) will know what a beautiful character John Ames is: a man of God, but a modest and above all a kind one. Christianity is in his bones and blood, and yet there is nothing doctrinaire about him; he talks to God, but has no time for Hell; his is a religion of welcome, never exclusion. His world is an extremely attractive one for me, as a former believer who remains interested in religion's attempts to answer the big questions, but utterly resists signing up for any faith.I should say, however, that this is far from theology for the masses. The books in her stolen Bible that Lila copies out to improve her handwriting, and ponders as she does so, are among the most difficult ones, Ezekiel and Job. \"It could be that the wildest, strangest things in the Bible,\" she thinks, \"were the places where it touched earth.\" Without fully understanding them, Lila is attracted to the verses in Ezekiel about the lightning and the whirlwind, or the babe abandoned in the field, weltering in its blood. Ames too tries to make the Bible touch earth: in affirming its relevance to his own life, explaining it to Lila, respecting the wild thing that she is, and building trust and tenderness between them.Marilynne Robinson's 1980 novel Housekeeping, written almost a quarter-century before her next one, Gilead, is also about drifters. Its back cover contains a phrase that has long stuck with me, \"The dangerous undertow of transience.\" I am struck by how Robinson's themes keep folding back on each other: transience, Gilead, home. I had always thought of home as a place to settle, a place to build, and place that you would never have to leave again. But in Lila, Robinson shows that the undertow of transience is always present, too. Even after they are married, Lila is not fully ready to settle with Ames, and he also accepts that she is liable to go off at any moment. This is where the influence of Faulkner comes in. It is not simply a matter of present-day narrative and flashbacks. Past and present are folded together inextricably, each growing within the other. At all times, Lila carries with her the memories of where she has been, what she has suffered, and the people she has loved. Gradually, we learn more about her, and come to revise our estimates of her age, background, and character. She is no angel, and has been through more than we ever knew. But we come to see her as truly a good person, and Ames' love becomes in turn our own.A small example. After Lila has given birth to the young son whom we will glimpse in Gilead, Ames decides to take him fishing. Lila imagines telling the story to him once he is old enough to understand:\nHe had his pole and creel in his hand and you in the crook of his arm and he went off down the road in the morning sunshine, striding along like a younger man, talking to you, laughing. He came back an hour later. He set the empty creel on the table and said, \"We propped the pole and watched dragonflies. Then we got a little tired.\" And what a look he gave her, in the sorrow of his happiness.\nWith countless scenes like that, Marilynne Robinson offers her readers a radiant gift. And that final phrase is sheer genius.======*I would go further and urge that you read Lila first, if you have not read Gilead. Otherwise, read this as though it were first. This counteracts the tendency to see the book as merely the back-story of a character being groomed for a minor role in the more famous novel, and Lila can appear as the wild force that she is, as protagonist in her own right."}, {"userName": "Cathrine \u262f\ufe0f ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22600410-cathrine", "userReview": "3\u2605My fourth Marilynne Robinson book, and though I\u2019m a fan, my least favorite in the Gilead series.

I feel detached and somewhat bored at points. The structure bothers me. No chapters, just pages that keep going with past events against the current ones in protagonist Lila\u2019s story. I feel the need to stop and ponder, but do not know when or if I should, except at the designated few and far between break points. I feel there should be more of them but the narrative just keeps going and changes directions like my mind when it keeps running and won\u2019t shut off, as if there won\u2019t be another day or time to take up thinking again. Lila\u2019s story is heartbreaking yet fascinating from my modern point of view but unfolds in a similar manner to the way my grandparents and parents communicated. They used the Less Is More approach and rarely showed emotions. Like Lila, they were stoic with strong work ethics and kept their secrets close. I know more about her than I do about all of them combined. These paragraphs form a hymn of sorts to them and their kind. With the author\u2019s gift of prose there is truth and beauty in the telling yet there is a disconnect for me.

The story is told by Lila, since we heard John Ames story in \"Gilead\", but is really a prequel to that story. There is a lot of religious discussion between the two of them, very interesting because it pits his conservative Calvinism against her street smarts and common sense. Personally, I thought she won every discussion, although she did consent to be baptized, but then she rinsed it off so it wouldn't really count. There's gentle humor like that all through this book.

Lila is a prequel, then; its present-day is the late 1940s, when Lila\u2019s wanderings bring her to Gilead, Iowa and she falls into an altogether surprising romance with the elderly pastor. Yet it also stretches back to Lila\u2019s semi-feral upbringing with Doll and the gang, and her brief sojourn in a St. Louis whorehouse.As usual, Robinson treats themes of suffering, abandonment and grace with subtle, elegant prose. However, I wished Lila\u2019s story could have been in a more intimate, dialect-rich first person, to rival Ames\u2019s in Gilead; I also fear many readers will be put off by the biblical material here: it\u2019s essentially an extended analogy to the book of Hosea, plus there are frequent snatches of the books of Ezekiel and Job \u2013 not exactly accessible examples of scripture.(See my full review at For Books\u2019 Sake.)"}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "I received a review copy of this book from the publisher, but since it was a finalist for the National Book Award, I would have been reading it anyway!When I finally got around to reading Gilead, I was surprised by how much I liked it despite its very small world.

This one feels much more set in a specific time period, as Lila comes from a group of wanderers trying to survive during the Great Depression.The writing is powerful even in its simplicity, and there is a lot to think about through the contrast of Lila and the minister.

Sometimes fish rose for the bubbles. The smell of soap was a little sharp, like the smell of the river. In that water you could rinse things clean. It might be a little brown after a good rain, soil from the fields, but the silt washed away or settled out.

In the second of the series, Home, the view changes to John Ames\u2019 best friend, a fellow minister named Boughton, and we meet Lila again through oblique references. In Lila, we finally get to know this enigmatic woman who, quite literally, becomes \u201cthe balm of Gilead\u201d for the minister.Here, in this novel, we learn that Lila has lived a hardscrabble life, traveling with a ragtag band of drifters, unable to fully trust or feel safe anywhere. She drifts into Gilead where she meets the much older, thoughtful minister and widower, John Ames, who offers her shelter, kindness, and security through marriage.The biggest question that looms for those of us who have taken Gilead to our hearts is this: \u201cDoes the novel Lila live up to its predecessors?\u201d Each reader must answer that question individually, but for me, the answer is complicated.I am unschooled in theology; a friend explained that certain Bible passages that Lila studies with John Ames are extraordinary statements from problematic parts of the Bible. My friend argues convincingly that through their conversations, Lila and Ames teach each other the meaning of existence.Yet I can\u2019t overlook a sort of verbal tic. Lila would make an off-the-cuff statement and over and over again, the next words (referring to Ames) are: \u201cHe laughed.\u201d John Ames\u2019 laughter is that of pure joy and recognition; it is neither cruel nor dismissive. Yet somehow, I began to feel that the interaction was one of a doting father to his precocious daughter and that Lila\u2019s view was not quite as meaningful as Ames.A major difference with Gilead is that that book was written in first-person from a gentle minister who was trying to make sense of his life, his humanity and his relationship with God. In this third book, written in third person, he is now in great part a teacher, and even though Lila \u2013 the protagonist \u2013 is a worthy sparring partner, I couldn\u2019t help but feel that Marilynne Robinson was leading the reader that John Ames\u2019 view was the right one to uphold and it would be a matter of time before Lila agreed.That being said, there is no way I can four-star this book. It is lovely and thoought-provoking and the writing soars; it\u2019s some of the best writing I\u2019ve read all year.

This book gives us the back story of Lila from the time she was snatched off the stoop by Doll, who saves her from a life of neglect. Not that life with Doll is easy either. They travel with others managing just to get by, sometimes by methods that not everyone would approve of. But hardship can make people do things others deem as wrong just to survive. Due to incidents in her life, Lila has a basic distrust of people and finds it hard to let anyone except Doll into her life and her heart. Even after she meets and marries The Reverend John Ames, there is a reticence in Lila. She is a long way from what many would perceive to be what a minister\u2019s wife should be. This book gives a fascinating insight into Lila, the circumstances that shaped her and her inability to trust. She is heartbreaking, but at the same time resourceful and hard working. It gives a clearer understanding of the relationship between her and her husband. Despite her lack of education, she has an inquiring mind and perceptive mind. From her reading of books like Ezekiel and Job, she certainly produces some interesting questions for the Reverend John Ames. Lila is such a mixture, naive in some ways, wise in others and at times the reader\u2019s heart breaks for her, or mine did.Like Gilead its companion book, I suspect this is one I will re-read and ponder over. Once again the prose is beautiful and drew me effortlessly into this story, but it is the characters that tug at the heart. I wanted to spend time with them and resented anything (like normal life) that took me out of their presence for any length of time. My review can\u2019t do credit to this story.

It falls into the category of more traditional themes and straight-forward storytelling with LILA sharing her innermost thoughts regarding everything from the events in her childhood and the early wanderings that brought her to Gilead, Iowa to her life as the wife of an elderly country preacher.While listening to this book on CD I found it difficult to follow the narrative which is as disjointed as the life of the woman whose story it tells. The narrative lazily meanders back and forth in time taking the reader from Lila's rescue at age four by the itinerant Doll, to her difficult life on the road where she relies on her instincts and survives by working as everything from a field hand to a cleaning woman in a whorehouse, and finally to her arrival in Iowa, her marriage and pregnancy (events not necessarily told in chronological order).There is an abundance of scripture quoting and examination of the Calvinist doctrines and theology which, while essential to the telling of this particular story, were not particularly absorbing.

I know what I'll get intellectually (and I like it), I know what I'll get in terms of character. This is my least favorite of the Gilead novels, but, dear reader, it might well be your favorite for the very same reasons I'm unmoved. \"Gilead\" is a letter written by a well-read pastor; \"Home\" is a third person novel about more than usually intelligent people. \"Lila\" is a very close third person novel about a woman who, through no fault of her own, has not had the opportunities given to Ames and the Boughton family. This is a perfect third novel, then, since it gives us a slightly different form (Home is about Jack's return home, mainly from Glory's point of view; this is about Lila from Lila's point of view), and a very different kind of subject (not the well-read pastor, not the looks-bad-but-is-good-at-heart returning son). Lila--a vagrant raised by atheists--and Ames struggle, in a suitably low-key way, to make their relationship work. There are lots of striking, emotional moments. But heavens above did this novel induce my claustrophobia. Robinson does a great job telling this tale exclusively from the perspective of a person who lacks all the resources of her earlier characters; in terms of craft, it's a marvel. But do want to *read* so much wide-eyed wonder at big words, and distrust of everyone and everything, told in a determinedly circular way? Do I want to hear, over and over and over again, about the same events, gaining only a tiny morsel of understanding with each retelling? Not really. All of that said, if you really like Housekeeping, you should probably read this novel rather than the other two Gileads. It has the same feel, many of the same themes, and only a tiny bit of the later books' theological matter. There is, however, a lot of bible quoting, as Lila teaches herself to read (= teaches herself to love others = teaches herself to be a human subject).

Non fanno una piega. E pi\u00f9 di una volta mi sono ritrovata, da parte mia, ad ascoltare \u2018sermoni per caso\u2019 a battesimi , matrimoni e funerali che mi hanno stupita e affascinata. Sono affezionata alle mie contraddizioni. E ho affrontato con leggerezza Lila, prequel della trilogia della Robinson ( mia scrittrice preferita in assoluto ) con Gilead e Casa. Leggerezza si fa per dire, perch\u00e9 anche i primi due erano roba per palati forti ma letti con la presunzione che ci\u00f2 che legge un credente pu\u00f2 leggerlo a maggior ragione un ateo. Del resto si trattava di messa in scena di mere esistenze.Ma la mera esistenza di Lila \u00e8 come se illuminasse le esistenze di quelli che l\u2019avevano preceduta negli altri due romanzi. E anche la mia. Molto prima di arrivare a Gilead \u00e8 stata una bambina abbandonata, una vagabonda, una prostituta il cui unico credere consiste nel credere nel nulla.\u201c \u2026 [il reverendo Ames diceva]preghiamo e tutti pregavano \u2026 era completamente inutile. I giorni andavano e venivano da soli, senza l\u2019aiuto delle preghiere. Eppure dappertutto, raduni e \u2026 gente che vede la luce\u2026 Trovava conforto dove conforto non c\u2019era. A proposito del significato dell\u2019esistenza diceva. Bene. Lei sapeva una cosetta o due sull\u2019esistenza. Era praticamente l\u2019unica questione su cui era informata, e aveva appreso da lui [John Ames ] la parola per indicarla. Era come per gli stati Uniti d\u2019America, dovevano pur dargli un nome. La sera e la mattina, il sonno e la veglia. La fame e la solitudine e la stanchezza e nonostante tutto volerne ancora. L\u2019esistenza. Ma perch\u00e9 ci perdo tempo? Lui non era riuscito a risponderle neppure su questo. Per\u00f2 lui lo sapeva, si capiva dal suo modo di fare. Perch\u00e9 ne voleva ancora, con quella casa cos\u00ec vuota, con la moglie e la figlioletta sottoterra da tanto tempo?... Quanta stranezza\u2026\u201dE per tutto il romanzo, con Lila \u2013 nel senso letterale del termine \u2013 ho cercato la risposta al perch\u00e9 le cose accadono, ma ho letto solo di dolore :  Come \u00e8 possibile che tutto questo ( povert\u00e0, sofferenza) non avesse importanza? Quasi non succedeva altro. Se invece aveva importanza, come poteva il mondo andare avanti visto che tanta gente viveva nelle stesse condizioni o addirittura peggio? La povert\u00e0 non contava niente, essere stanchi e affamati non contava niente. Era solo gente che cercava di tirare avanti, e senza il minimo rispetto, perfino il vento insudiciava. \u2026 Questa era l\u2019esistenza, e allora perch\u00e9 non tuonava e si squarciava da quella tempesta che era, se quasi non \u00e8 fatta d\u2019altro che di quell\u2019amarezza e di quella paura? \u2026 Per lei la quiete dal mondo era orribile, una presa in giro.E lei ragiona fra s\u00e9 sul male che aveva lasciato segni sulla sua pelle di bambina prima e di adulta poi, ma ne chiede le ragioni anche a lui. Che sembra non sapere rispondere con dimostrazioni buone una volta per tutte. Non sono che un corpo che pensa e parla e sembra voler vivere, ancora un altro giorno. Non devi per forza sapere perch\u00e9 lei gli dice ma lui le risponde con un versetto sacro di una bellezza sconvolgente:Un giorno sgorga parole all\u2019altro, una notte comunica conoscenza all\u2019altra. \u2026 Non hanno favella, n\u00e9 parole, la voce non s\u2019ode \u2026. Nessuna la capisce, completamente. Per\u00f2 \u00e8 bellaE poi cerca di dare un \u201cnon senso\u201dlogico all\u2019esistenza:\u201c Le cose accadono per motivi a noi nascosti, totalmente nascosti finch\u00e8 siamo convinti che debbano derivare da ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 venuto prima, le nostre colpe o i nostri meriti, anzich\u00e9 pervenirci da un futuro che Dio nella sua libert\u00e0 ci offre \u2026 in effetti non si pu\u00f2 spiegare ci\u00f2 che accade con ci\u00f2 che \u00e8 accaduto in passato o con l\u2019interpretazione che se ne da, la quale pu\u00f2 differire molto dal passato stesso. Posto che il passato esista davvero \u2026 la sola conoscenza di Dio nasce dall\u2019obbedienza \u2026Con questo non intendo dire che la gioia \u00e8 una compensazione della perdita, ma che ciascuna, la gioia come la perdita, esiste di per s\u00e9 e deve essere riconosciuta per quello che \u00e8. Il dolore \u00e8 molto reale e la perdita ci appare assolutamente irrevocabile. La vita sulla terra \u00e8 difficile e grave, e piena di meraviglia. La nostra esperienza \u00e8 frammentaria. Le sue parti non quadrano. Non rientrano nello stesso calcolo. A volte stentiamo a credere che siano parte di un\u2019unica cosa. Tutto ci appare assurdo finch\u00e8 non capiamo che l\u2019esperienza non si accumula come denaro o i ricordi o come gli anni e gli acciacchi. \u2026 non ci \u00e8 possibile conciliare i vari elementi dell\u2019esistenza, perch\u00e9 ci vengono dati senza alcuna necessit\u00e0 a eccezione della Grazia di Dio che ci sostiene come creature in cui ci possiamo riconoscere. Mi \u00e8 sempre sembrato straordinario che si riesca a fare questo. Che non si riesca a non farlo. Cos\u00ec che la gioia pu\u00f2 essere gioia e il dolore dolore, senza che nessuno dei due getti luce o ombra sull\u2019altro.Certo non pu\u00f2 la Robinson per bocca di Ames convertirmi a questo dio inconoscibile come lo \u00e8 l\u2019esistenza, e per questo rimettermi alla sua volont\u00e0. Pu\u00f2 per\u00f2 aiutarmi a capire perch\u00e9 sono affascinata dalla interpretazione dell\u2019esistenza attraverso il vangelo, anche prima di imbattermi in Lila. C\u2019\u00e8 un momento nella vita, per quanto fortunata e ovattata possa essere stata, che sei di fronte alla semplice domanda del perch\u00e9 le cose accadano. Non c\u2019\u00e8 welfare perfetto che possa alleviarti dal dolore. Non c\u2019\u00e8 presa in carico totalizzante del corpo che possa lenire le pene della mente. Certo aiuta ma il dolore rimane, ti tritura i cabasisi alla grande ma il giorno dopo sei viva. Solo per mera istinto di conservazione? Il dolore che \u00e8 paura anzi terrore e pi\u00f9 hai amato e pi\u00f9 il terrore \u00e8 grande? Non sta per\u00f2 in questo amore la chiave di tutto? Non \u00e8 John Ames estremamente buono e amorevole riuscendo con lui la Robinson dove Dostoevskij con \u00e8 riuscito col povero principe My\u0161kin? \u00c8 lui, il reverendo Ames, la risposta alle domande non formulate di Lila."}], "description": "Lila, homeless and alone after years of roaming the countryside, steps inside a small-town Iowa church-the only available shelter from the rain-and ignites a romance and a debate that will reshape her life. She becomes the wife of a minister and widower, John Ames, and begins a new existence while trying to make sense of the days of suffering that preceded her newfound security.Neglected as a toddler, Lila was rescued by Doll, a canny young drifter, and brought up by her in a hardscrabble childhood of itinerant work. Together they crafted a life on the run, living hand-to-mouth with nothing but their sisterly bond and a lucky knife to protect them. But despite bouts of petty violence and moments of desperation, their shared life is laced with moments of joy and love. When Lila arrives in Gilead, she struggles to harmonize the life of her makeshift family and their days of hardship with the gentle worldview of her husband which paradoxically judges those she loves.Revisiting the beloved characters and setting of Marilynne Robinson's Pulitzer Prize-winning Gilead and Orange Prize-winning Home, Lila is a moving expression of the mysteries of existence.", "title": "Lila\n      \n          (Gilead #3)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22845911-lila", "average": 3.91, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1406816799l/22845911.jpg", "reviews": 3410, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7491.Marilynne_Robinson", "name": "Marilynne Robinson"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "Literary Fiction", "Novels", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22845911-lila", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18513565-lila", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23637517-lila", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20575411-lila", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22663115-lila", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31227849", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23015338-lila", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20757547-lila", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26848206-lila", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27811197-lila", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/68210.Gilead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11741.Housekeeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2924318-home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12095063-when-i-was-a-child-i-read-books", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114809.The_Death_of_Adam"]}
