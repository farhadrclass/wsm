It's a zombie novel.They urghh and arghh like any zombie just a little faster. Just because you place a X instead of a Z doesn't make it different. You can put replace SK in skunk with a X and it stills stinks.But is it a good zombie novel? It's a little early to tell but so far I keep thinking of Xunks.---------I finished it and will have a rating and full review up shortly. Hint: It is definitely not a xunk.---------So anyways...Xombies: Apocalpse Blue, the first installment of Greatshell's Xombies series isn't a xunk but it is not exactly a rose (xose?) either. While it is a zombie novel it manages to do what all good zombie novels must do and that is be about something other than zombies. One of its faults is that it tends to be about way more than the author can comfortably handle. The first section features the onslaught of zombies, called xombies for reasons explained in the book, and the struggle for survival by our 17 year old heroine Lulu. Then about a third through the focus shifts away from xombies to the isolation and struggle of the survivors for power...on a submarine no less! This change is both incredibly imaginative and somewhat chaotic. We are introduced to some very shady characters and the basic themes are developed involving...well, I won't ruin it for you but lets just say some of our evil protagonist's ideas are sort of Ayn Rand turned on her head. Speaking of Ayn Rand, how come no one has ever written a novel in which Ayn Rand is a zombie? That would explain a lot. But I digress...I ended up liking this book. However there was much that disturbed me. There are no really likable character. The main character Lulu comes close but she often feels too unreal to really identify with. Also, by the end it become very hard to take sides with anyone. In fact, I started to side with the xombies although I suspect that may actually have been the author's intention. But in the long run, the originality of this novel and the author's riveting style wins out to the point that I give it three and a half stars."}, {"userName": "Nick", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/724379-nick", "userReview": "The best parts of the story itself had very little to do with the zombies, spelled with an \"X\" for reasons that will become apparent to anyone who reads the book. The strength of the story is the tale of what mankind will do in a truly global crisis, and how they react, as groups or as individuals.The cover artist, or the art director who approved the design, should of course be severely punished. The abnormally young appearance of the central character is a major plot point, and she HAS no cleavage to display, nor would she in the sub-freezing temperatures of the scene displayed on the cover.The story's weakness, oddly enough, was the scientific basis for the zombies. For me, that part didn't hold together as well as the story itself, which was a fascinating survival tale that I couldn't put down. Fast-moving, instant-conversion zombies with no visible source of energy...not so much.One other minor thing was that by the end of the story, the main character's mother had migrated from nuisance to actual villain in my mind, as the character's medical condition was re-diagnosed. Still, a very good story with many strong points."}, {"userName": "Cindy Engelhardt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1773203-cindy-engelhardt", "userReview": "This book is not for genre fans.

I have way too many books vying for my attention to force myself to finish a book that is boring me witless.Xombies started out well with a young girl named Lulu waking up one day to discover the world has gone mad and it seems that all women have turned into raging blue-faced Xombies due to some sort of disease. Lulu escapes this fate because she has a health condition that prevents her from maturing.

The title is also more relevant to the submarine voyage and its resulting dominating aspects onto the storyline.Written in the first person perspective from the principal character of Lulu (Louise Alaric Pangloss) who is a seventeen-year-old girl afflicted with Chromosomal Primary Amenorrhea (a condition that suspends her from reaching puberty and therefore undergoing her menstrual cycle). Lulu and her mother soon learn of the airborne virus named \u2018Agent X\u2019 that is mysteriously spreading across the planet changing all women undergoing the menstrual cycle (i.e post-puberty and pre-menopause) into feral members of the undead who have been appropriately dubbed \u2018xombies\u2019.The virus is not purely exclusive to women, but can be transmitted to men or indeed females who not undergoing their menstrual cycle, upon their death, but more often via a \u2018kiss of death\u2019 that is administered by one of the undead xombies.Lulu\u2019s mother quickly falls foul to the plague, leaving Lulu on her own in this terrifying new post-apocalyptic world. Before long, Lulu is running from a horde of attacking xombies (one of which is her very own mother) when she is rescued by her father, Fred Cowper, who Lulu has never properly known. It turns out that Cowper was a highly respected Navy veteran who had retired from the service a while back. Cowper now takes Lulu to a secret Navel outpost which is one of the few remaining areas offering protection to its men.Upon arrival all hell breaks loose, with wave after wave of xombies storming the premises. Lulu (the only female there) and the four-hundred or so men and boys stationed at the outpost, board the huge submarine that is docked there. The submarine under the direction of a Commander Coombs is being taken to a new secret and much more secure location. Lulu, Cowper et all manage to board the submarine in a daring and desperate last act initiated by Cowper.With the submarine now carrying too many passengers, rationing becomes life threatening, as well as maintaining control aboard the submarine. Wherever Coombs plans to take the submarine is kept as a secret until they close in to their final destination. But what have these few remaining survivors of this terrible apocalypse got in store for them when they do arrive at this new secret destination?From the start Greatshell delivers a cleverly and well written zombie novel that screams of Nevil Shute\u2019s despairingly apocalyptic novel \u2018On The Beach\u2019 mixed with undead action that has immediate echoes of the likes of Danny Boyle\u2019s 2002 movie \u201928 Days Later...\u2019 as well as David Wellington\u2019s \u2018Monster\u2019 trilogy.With the majority of the novel taken up by the downbeat desperation aboard the submarine, the reader can\u2019t help but feel reminded of the futile situation detailed so thouroughly throughout the novel \u2018On The Beach\u2019. Indeed, Greatshell plays along the lines of the misguided authority well, keeping the reader completely in the dark as to what is going on in so many occasions.The atmospheric depth to the novel is truly second to none, with haunting moments of xombie madness lurking around each and every corner. Greatshell skilfully mounts up the suspense to Commander Coombs\u2019s final planned destination for the submarine, until the reader is thrust into a whole new scenario that simply throws you to a whole new unnerving level.The characterization throughout is beautifully developed, with a real love and heart felt sympathy going out towards the character of Lulu who is narrating the tale. The cold and emotionless boundaries projected by a number of the other characters, only further strengthens the hostile emotional atmosphere to the novel.As a whole, the tale involves a reasonably complex array of subplots that weave a tightly-knit storyline throughout. The reader can\u2019t help but become immediately submersed in this frightening new apocalyptic world.Greatshell utilises a number of graphically violent moments at various predominant moments throughout the tale. This also includes a couple of disturbingly realistic moments of sexual violence, that although not hugely graphic in their descriptions, still leaves the reader with haunting images of the ordeals Lulu is put through etched on their brain.All in all, \u2018Xombies\u2019 delivers a thought-provoking and highly original take on a zombie novel, that sets down a carefully thought out storyline to draw the reader into its dark depths. With so many strong points to the novel, the reader can feel somewhat bombarded by the unrelenting emotional turmoil that the narrator is clearly being put through. Greatshell rarely allows the reader to break the surface of this emotional assault, adding further to the delivery of this chaotic and desperate new world.The novel runs for a total of 346 pages and was first published by Berkley Books. Walter Greatshell has a sequel novel planned entitled \u2018Xombies: Apocalypticon\u2019."}, {"userName": "Jeff Jellets", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15694222-jeff-jellets", "userReview": "Xombies is a hard book to categorize.It would be easy to just pigeonhole it as yet another zombie apocalypse story \u2013 but that would be the lazy reviewer\u2019s way out because there\u2019s a lot more to Xombies then \u2026 well \u2026 ummm \u2026 zombies. From a bit of The Hunt for Red October, to (as the cover proclaims) Lord of the Flies, to grim dystopian sci-fi, Xombies seems to move pretty effortlessly from genre to genre. But let\u2019s start out with the zombie stuff because there\u2019s nothing I like better than a good zombie novel and, for at least two thirds of the novel, Xombies works really well as just that. In today\u2019s market, it may be hard to make any zombie outbreak feel fresh, but author Walter Greatshell pulls it off. The book\u2019s first two chapters are permeated with the creepy emptiness of \u201ca-world-turned-off\u201d by a sinister contagion and, when the zombies do arrive, it\u2019s heart-pounding and portrayed with cinematic vividness. Like a good horror flick, it\u2019s something you know is coming, but like a good film director, Greatshell still manages to build the tension and scare the pants off you when the inevitable rotting horde arrives.Greatshell\u2019s writing is clearly a large part of what makes this book enjoyable. Clean, crisp and built for speed, I pretty much devoured (pun!) the whole book in just a few days as Greatshell\u2019s characters, pacing and plot twists kept me turning pages. There\u2019s a wonderfully horrific section with an abandoned cruise ship ensconced in ice and lots of little twists and turns (such as when the characters make a quick stop in Newfoundland) that make this a really great horror story for most of the book.But there is more. Greatshell also does a pretty good Tom Clancy imitation as sets the book\u2019s protagonists up on a nuclear sub and, with only a single woman aboard, Greatshell is also able to channel William Golden and reinvent the tension of Lord of the Flies as a very Darwinist struggle simmers between the surviving boys, military men, and the lone heroine, Lulu. In less capable hands, I could see these elements fusing into quite a mess, but Greatshell handles these elements pretty effortlessly and hammers then into something a lot more than \u201cjust-another-zombie story.\u201dPerhaps unfortunately, the book doesn\u2019t stop there and, as the protagonists reach a very questionable sanctuary in Greenland, Greatshell risks adding one more straw to the camel\u2019s back, and we head into the realm of dystopian sci-fi more than anything else. Even here there is still a lot to like as the author moves the cast rather gracefully into a strange domed compound \u2013 complete with Vegas-style facades of the world\u2019s greatest cities and, outside the main compound, a \u201cbillionaires-in-exile\u201d airfield of stranded corporate jets. But the novel does seem to lose its footing here \u2013 almost as if the author was about as unsure as his characters as to what to do next. Where before the plot seemed to move along effortlessly, things start to meander a bit, lots of perverse old guys are introduced, and when the ending does come, it\u2019s kind of unsatisfying. Maybe it feels a bit like the movie 28 Days Later? All that cool zombie stuff up front, and then the last half of the movie we get stuck inside a military base with some sexually frustrated soldiers whose only interest seems to be hanging on to last remaining women in England. Yeah \u2026 the end of the book feels a bit like that.Still, despite the disappointing ending, Xombies is worth a look. So much of the novel is over-the-top fantastic than I can forgive the end and write it off as just a set-up for the next book in the series \u2013 which I will dutifully buy."}, {"userName": "Robert Beveridge", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/766524-robert-beveridge", "userReview": "Walter Greatshell, Xombies (Berkley, 2004)Fairly standard zombie novel, when it's a zombie novel, but it very quickly becomes something else; the zombies are just a prop to get our core group of survivors onto a nuclear sub, where the real core of zombie novels-- the interplay between the survivors-- takes place. Not much chance to actually see too many zombies once they're on the sub, so some might consider this a bit of mismarketing. Me, I liked it well enough.The plot: the survivors of a global plague of zombies (or xombies, as the case may be) caused by a virus called Agent X (you see where the term \u201cxombie\u201d comes from) force a ragtag band of Naval personnel, submarine yard workers, and the daughter of the sub's commander onto a nuclear sub headed for the icy wastes of the extreme north, where, it's presumed, the xombies will all be frozen. Roughly two-thirds of the book takes place on the sub, with the other third split between before-sub and after-sub. The thing that's likely to make or break this novel for you-- assuming you're past the whole \u201cit's not really a zombie novel\u201d bit-- is the narrative voice. Normally I'd have likely found it grating, as the narrator, and many of the survivors with whom she has the most contact, are all eighteen or under. And boy do they sound like it. Yet there's something oddly charming about it in this case, with its badly-out-of-date (even in 2004) slang and devil-may-care attitude. This is important, given that the bulk of the book is nothing but this. I'm not entirely sure why it worked for me, but it did. The plot is solid enough to keep the pages turning, though it is derivative of a number of other works (the blurb that calls the book \u201ca mix of 28 Days Later... and Lord of the Flies was written by someone who didn't have to look too hard). In short, it's not something that's going to break any boundaries, but if you're just looking for a good, solid thriller, this will fit the bill. *** \u00bd"}, {"userName": "Jason Bradley Thompson", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8314777-jason-bradley-thompson", "userReview": "The best zombie book (okay, specifically: running zombies) I've ever read, bar none. An ultra-weird science fiction bio-apocalypse with the world transformed instantaneously into a crazed game of \"blob tag\" between billions of unkillable blue zombies and a rapidly dwindling number of military outposts.The gigantic zombie crowd scenes here anticipate the \"World War Z\" movie, but whereas that movie is serious and Brad-Pitt-heroic all through, this book is a bit more gonzo and funny. Not overtly comedic, but the absurdity of the situation reaches a point where you have to laugh, and there's over-the-top characters and images scattered throughout: the heroine's father, the trained Xombie-killing orangutan, the Beatles cover band. But when it needs to be scary and serious, it's completely convincing. The Xombies are unstoppable hunting machines, and their passionate lust for the living is scarier than any other zombie's cannibal snarl. The book ends on something of a cliffhanger, but in the best way, with some questions answered and others left open for the sequels (which Greatshell wrote several years after the first book; I get the impression it was originally intended to be a 1-book thing). Anyway, this book's ending is fairly satisfying by itself; when I found out there were sequels, it was like I'd had a full-course meal, and then ALSO found that extra piece of chocolate cake in the back of the fridge.(As a side note, I can't believe some reviewers complained about the fact that the zombies are unkillable. Why do unkillable zombies get no love? Doesn't anyone respect classics like \"Deadalive\" or \"Return of the Living Dead\"? :P Without going too deeply into spoilers, the 'zombies' in this book are really more like \"The Blob\" or \"The Thing\" than boring old George Romero/Walking Dead zombies.)"}, {"userName": "Thee_ron_clark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/608637-thee-ron-clark", "userReview": "Here we have another take on zombies.

He seemed to have come out of nowhere and dive onto the scene with this very exciting zombie novel with a military/sci-fi/medical twist. The first two thirds are the strongest, and then the book takes a drastic shift. Some will enjoy it, some might not. I was in between. It was still very gripping, just not what I expected. I had a hard time believing that things could have been as organized as they were (at the air base) in such a short time with all the chaos going on. The science fiction aspect at Thule seemed way ahead of the technology when the story takes place. That being said, Greatshell's technical writing is very accomplished and the imagery tensely vivid. His action moves very quickly and I really had a great time reading this. There were some moments, but only a few, where I was confused with the action and had to reread passages to figure out what was happening. Regardless, this is certainly one of the better zombie books in recent years, right up there with author Kim Paffenroth's Dying To Live, and the sequel Dying To Live: Life Sentence. I found this even more enjoyable than the Brian Keene zombie books. Readers should be warned, however, that Walter Greatshell's other book, Xombies: Apocalypse Blues, is the same book as this one, only retitled. Apparently, the only difference is that a character's accent was taken out for the reprinted version to make his dialogue more clear. Personally, I thought the accent was great and should have stayed the same, but I'm guessing that was a publisher decision and not the author.

The conceit here is that the titular \"Xombie\" virus (with an \"X\" for X chromosomes), was first airborne and affected all the women on earth capable of menstruation (the science for this part is soft enough to spread on a biscuit, so don't think to hard about it), but since our young heroine doesn't menstruate, she's immune - a single girl among hundreds of male refugees. What's odd is that pretty much every single member of a crew of hundreds - minus, basically, the dozen named characters - absolutely hate her with a vengeance for being (a) female and (b) not their moms/sisters/lovers/daughters that they left behind.This setup is so foreign that it seems extremely odd and alien. I've no doubt that in such a situation, there would be quite a large amount of resentment toward the surviving girl, but for basically *everyone* without a name billing to react this way is so anathema to human behavior, which is frequently varied. You'd think a good portion of the refugees would go overboard the *other* direction, adopting the girl with an uncomfortable fervor to replace the ones who were lost, but not one person in this novel ever seems in the slightest danger of doing that, and it's just...weird. The few \"good\" guys just sort of tolerate and accept the protagonist, for the most part. And while it seems like a small complaint, it's worth noting that the male reactions to the female protagonist in their midst take up at least half of the novel, so that's a good half that (a) isn't filled with zombies, and (b) isn't a very realistic portrayal of the variance of human emotion and is therefore distracting and odd.Anyway, we plunge on. Obviously, what with all humans being horrible jerks and with most of the women on earth out of commission (minus the very young and the very old), it's just a matter of time before the raping begins, and probably enough said about that except that it's rather rare to see an author embrace the reality that the raping isn't going to be confined to male-on-female in a situation like this. The narrative glosses over without any gory details, but somehow this matter-of-fact handling of the horrors makes them worse, and I am forced to admit that of all the novels I've read where it seems humanity might do best to wipe itself out, Greatshell manages to make one of the most terribly convincing cases - most readers will be rooting for the xombies to win, before the end.If I'm disappointed with \"Xombies\", it's perhaps because I feel a lot of potential was wasted. The titular infected only take up about a third of the novel, with the other third focusing on interim survival and humans being jerks, leaving the novel feeling a little weak on the actual horror. The infected are scary, and yet somehow hard to take seriously - they are bright blue (easy to identify) and they turn humans by kissing, rather than biting, them - a plot point that would *seem* to make it easier to prevent being turned, by handing out oxygen masks to everyone. For that matter, a lot seems to have been poorly thought out - the infected aren't put down easily, and even a loose arm or leg can continue to attack apart from the body, and while that sounds like an *extremely* fun plot point, nothing is ever really done with it, which seems very much like a Missing Moment of Awesome. There should be at *least* one scene where a peacefully sleeping person is killed by a rogue arm that made its way slowly through the air ducts, or something. And since half the xombies are intelligent, it's just plain odd that they don't rip their own limbs off in the face of destruction, to achieve this. Beyond anything else, despite these zombies being the theoretically impossible to take down with basic weapons, the humans manage to do so time and again, without any real explanation - we're just to assume that they easily and quickly bludgeon everything into a pulpy mass, and it just doesn't work well in the imagination.I enjoyed this book overall, and I'll probably pick up the sequel, but the soft science and self-induced plot holes, the one-size-fits-all social commentary, and the slow pacing means I probably won't read this one again.~ Ana Mardoll"}, {"userName": "Amy Webster-Bo", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75295179-amy-webster-bo", "userReview": "first book though I read it as Xombies apoclypso blues, was still good"}, {"userName": "Moonyreaders", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45358568-moonyreaders", "userReview": "No es la mejor novela del mundo y sigo sin ser fan de la tem\u00e1tica de zombis pero al menos el argumento es original."}, {"userName": "Patrick D'Orazio", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328815-patrick-d-orazio", "userReview": "Its hard for me to pin this book down.

He expended some effort to make this new Xombie creation and I give him credit for that. The author also has a strong working knowledge of submarines and the Navy, which helped tremendously with the story line. Do I know if he was totally accurate in all his descriptions? No, but the details were exceptional and kept that part of the story believable. Overall, he has fleshed out a very detailed and deliberate tale that does twist a few times and surprised me. Once again, this is not your average tale of the undead. What I expected going in was another apocalyptic tale of survival and while that is a part of this-it is the foundation, the story diverges from that dramatically by the end. I did like Lulu, the main character. She is fully developed (well...the character is, physically she is far from developed) and believable in many ways. I think the author spent so much time on her though that he delved a great deal less on the other characters. Her father is detailed and a few boys on the sub stand out, but they are all rather limited in scope next to our heroin. Of course the story is told in first person so she is the shining star of it all and we see everything from her perspective. There were just too many peripheral characters that snuck in and out of the story and didn't mean too much. I didn't complain about the fact that we get to know the fate of the main character before the story even starts, I can accept that as a plot device-we know the end, but how do you get there? The question in instances like this usually is: Is this story strong enough to allow the audience to know up front the fate of our hero/heroin? Unfortunately, I am not sure that this story was. I did not really enjoy huge chunks of the book and while it was strong in places the bit revealed in the beginning just dampened my expectations even with the surprises the author unleashes. It seemed a grind through certain areas of text and I found my self just trying to muddle through. The author knows how to put detail into his work and I guess the claustrophobia and stir crazy experience of the characters in the sub wormed its way through too well for me. I just wanted them to get off the damn boat as much as they did after a while. The bottom line for me was this book just does not resonate. Sure, it was interesting, it was different, and I am sure there is a message in there somewhere (power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely?) but some of it was just odd. I guess having a boy who has a fur fetish, old men who are willing to pretend that young boys in makeup and dresses are an adequate replacement for real women, muslim Beatle cover bands and many other things are all ok, but it was just too surreal I guess. I do wish more time was spent with the Xombies themselves-more action sequences giving us more exposure to them. They just don't get too much coverage throughout the book. They appear in the beginning and in the end, but there is this huge gaping maw in the middle that really dragged. I would definitely have liked to get to know the Blue Meanies a bit more. This book was a novelty that was creative and certainly different but still left me feeling I could take it or leave it. As is usually the case for me I was glad I read something new and different, but in the end, it won't be a lasting memory for me."}, {"userName": "IzamaRi H.

Personas extremadamente fuerte, inteligente y con una extra\u00f1a piel azul. El mundo se est\u00e1 viniendo abajo, pero Lul\u00fa y su madre, encerradas en su casa, no se dan cuenta de nada, hasta que ya es demasiado tarde.Con la ayuda de su supuesto padre, Lul\u00fa huye de su madre, quien ha contra\u00eddo el virus y juntos huyen hacia una base militar secreta, donde descubren que aun siendo el fin del mundo, la corrupci\u00f3n existe. Y el lugar que creyeron seguro, no es m\u00e1s que una telara\u00f1a de mentiras e intrigas.El inicio del libro es muy bueno, Atraves de Lul\u00fa quien es nuestra narradora, vamos descubriendo poco a poco, las condiciones decadentes en las que se encuentra el planeta Vemos como los xombies cazan a los sobrevivientes para unirlos a sus filas, pero a diferencias de los zombies a los que estamos acostumbrados, los xombies no se comen a los humanos, ellos buscan salvarlos, llevarlos hacia el conocimiento y la inmortalidad. Es por eso que los xombies le dan a los vivos, \u201cel beso de la muerte\u201d para salvarlos de su humanidad.Que no se coman a los vivos, no los hace menos aterradores, pues al contrario, siendo unos seres inteligentes, se las ingenian para atrapar a todo aquel que respireLa historia en s\u00ed, es muy interesante. Como ya dije, el libro de entrada nos cuenta la situaci\u00f3n el mundo y los xombies, despu\u00e9s vemos como se organizan los militares y al final llegamos a un raro mundo apocal\u00edptico donde los ricos mandan y los j\u00f3venes son los que llevan las de perder.Pero el libro tiene dos grandes problemas.Uno, la hero\u00edna. Lul\u00fa no era m\u00e1s que una marioneta que todo mundo se pasaba. Primero su madre, despu\u00e9s su padre, los chicos del submarino la ten\u00edan de chivo expiatorio, el general a cargo del submarino la manipulo y al final, a pesar de todo lo que paso, la siguieron utilizando para dar cordura a los xombies. Hab\u00eda momentos en los que Lul\u00fa lograba desesperarme.Y el segundo problema, es que hay partes en el libro muy confusas. Por ejemplo, cuando a Lul\u00fa le explican porque las mujeres son las que m\u00e1s se infectan por el virus, le dicen que es debido a una anormalita gen\u00e9tica que los humanos crearon atraves del cromosoma X pero aunque los explican c\u00f3mo tres veces en el mismo capitulo, aun as\u00ed no termine de entenderlo y al parecer nuestra hero\u00edna tampoco pues hab\u00eda momentos en los que segu\u00eda haci\u00e9ndose la misma pregunta.A pesar de que Lul\u00fa, no cubri\u00f3 para m\u00ed el papel de protagonista, hay otros personajes que si lo lograron, como Fred Cowper, el supuesto pap\u00e1 de Lul\u00fa, quien a pesar de no aparecer mucho, las pocas participaciones que tiene son de gran tama\u00f1o y cambian todo el rumbo de las cosas.Tambi\u00e9n estan los chicos, H\u00e9ctor, Julian, Jake, Shawn, Lemuel y Cole, quienes acompa\u00f1aran a Lul\u00fa atraves de todo el libro haciendo m\u00e1s interesantes las misiones de la chica.Y ya para terminar, quiz\u00e1s muchos de ustedes no deseen leer esto, as\u00ed que les advierto, puede ser un spoiler si desean leer el libro\u2026 Algo que me impacto de este libro, fue que el autor no sinti\u00f3 el m\u00e1s m\u00ednimo remordimiento a la hora de matar a sus personajes. Cuando me encari\u00f1aba con uno, lo mata al siguiente capitulo. Fue toda una matanza de personajes.Entonces, si quieren conocer unos xombies totalmente distintos y saber m\u00e1s sobre la milicia, sin lugar a dudas tiene que leer este libro."}, {"userName": "Zombieslayer/Alienhunter {Don't do school, and stay in drugs}", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36608006-zombieslayer-alienhunter-don-t-do-school-and-stay-in-drugs", "userReview": "I slugged my way through the first half of this book figuring i'd probably give it two stars.I'm just out of a reading slump, and I wanted to return to my comfort zone; booting, shooting, slaying, spraying, tearing up and burning down zombies every way possible.Walter Greatshell's Xombies was one of the first few zombie titles I added to my TBR after joining Goodreads, if the first half of my username doesn't suggest that I have a slight infactuation with the dearly undeparted.That being said, Xombies wasn't my cup of viral tea.Our protagonist, seventeen-year-old Louise 'Lulu' Pangloss (oh, Christ...) has lived in relative seclusion with her mother while the two tracked down the man Ms. Pangloss believes to be Lulu's father, elderly Fred Cowper.Lulu has Chromosomal Primary Amenorrhea, which causes her to look about ten years old, have no monthly cycle...And be immune to 'Agent X', the virus currently spreading rampantly throughout the world. It's believed to be passed bodily though contact with the infected, which is commonly a kiss from one of the infected creatures.Symptoms include spontaneous disrobing, inability to speak, and the skin taking on a peculiar blue pigment.What?Dude, they talked about Yellow Submarine in the freaking book!Anyway, after Lulu's mother succumbs to Agent X, like most all other females not pre-pubescent or post-menopausal, she escapes with Fred Cowper, and the two bully their way into a crew of Naval officers and their male family members.The rag-tag group takes off on a trip across the seas in attempt to escape the virus, which Lulu might not only be immune to, but might be able to cure.Boy oh boy. You know, i'm never one to rag too hard on the 'special snowflakes', but Lulu was like Harry Potter, Margo Roth-Spiegelman and Holden Caulfield all mixed into one.The 'Chosen One' trope is not something I, as the reader, can easily relate to. I'd much rather read about perfectly normal people, like myself, saving humanity from the Blue Meanies, thank you very much.I am also not a fan of overly philosophical zombie books. I get the idea, we're trying to save the world, but why? I totally get it.But jam it with your freaking nautical talk and eighty-five syllable words and please just blow the zombies up.Please.This is also heavily ripping off Night of the Living Dead and 28 Days Later, just judging by the zombies' (spelled 'xombies' in this book, for God's sake...) behavior and movements.It's not the most original, well-written, zombie book I've read with the greatest characters or the most investing plot, it's basically the plight of Good vs. Evil, Poor vs. Rich, Haves vs. Have-Nots, in all honesty.But hey, if you like books that spend more than half the plot on a freaking boat talking about zombies, by all means, check it out."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1347210-kelly", "userReview": "Premenstrual hater. The premise of the story is this: One day all the women who were menstruating turned into blue zombies, went nuts and spent the remainder of the story sharing the wealth. X= female gene, get it? Lacking. The tale has no imagination, significance, and continuity. Offensive. It overflows with sexism, prejudice, and bigotry. Believe me people it\u2019s pretty hard to offend me, yet this book did it with every turn of the page. Trite. It tries your patience with impossible scenarios, obscure actions, and an unconvincing cast. Precipitant. The action is rushed, and the revelations fleeting. Apparent. Everything is pushed in your face, leaving no mystery to unfold. Boring. Chaotic. The events unfold without any organization or order. Exhausting. By the time you get to the climax, you\u2019re so tired from the journey that the ending is powerless. Absent. Tenuous. Mythical. Omitted. Supposed. Pretended. Hypothetical. Empty. Redundant to find more ways to tell you there wasn\u2019t one! Ethereal. Sham. His battering of characters' dialogue is nothing more than his abuse of the thesaurus to sound more diverse. Transformation. Throughout the book, the dialect constantly switches. Ex.: \u201cShe has a genetic problem- Lulu, what\u2019s it called?\u201d next paragraph, same character: \u201cRight, and she\u2019s been survivin\u2019 on her own since this stahted-almost a whole month with them bastids.\u201d Young. Greatshell\u2019s issues bleed into the book far too much and way too often. The result? Mutiny! Lazy. Instead of delivering a fresh new idea, we get recycled narratives, and voiced discriminations with a little apathy on the side for good measure. Exploitation. The abuse of acronyms in this book is abundant and could very well be hazardous to the readers\u2019 state of mind. Clich\u00e9d. Greatshell uses every action ever expected from zombies. No new territory here folks keep on moving. Hilarious. The main character Lulu is 17, acts like a 50 year-old woman, but looks like a 9 year old. Even a blind man could see this wasn\u2019t going to work. Arrogant. The military men are naturally superior to the citizens. The men feel above any and all females and little Lulu is just egotistical. Reactive. Whether it was intended or not, I promise you will respond to these characters. Absurd. Magically, the indefinable Lulu is protected from the disease, imagine that. Crude. Way too many profanities! Thickheaded. Apparently, it is possible to travel, eat out, and basically do your normal everyday activities and be completely ignorant of the end of the world. Excessive. All of the players are over-the-top and melodramatic. Routine. Not one of these characters will surprise you, not even the zombies. Stereotypical. The southern men speak hillbilly, the African-Americans speak Ebonics, and the city kids speak slang with a Bronx accent. Really, need I say more? My rating? I give it 1.

Described as \"28 Days Later meets Lord of the Flies,\" I thought I might as well give it a go. I loved 28 Days Later, and I really enjoyed the Forest of Hands and Teeth series, so a zombie book seemed like a great idea.Walter Greatshell's writing was okay. He jumped into the action really quickly, after giving a pretty decent description of the main character, Lulu, and her mother and their life. I didn't really feel there was any stand-out prose, but there weren't any parts that made me frustrated. It was just less descriptive and emotional than I'd have liked, and so I probably wouldn't have finished this book if it wasn't for the fact that it progressed so smoothly. I can't say the book particularly bored me, but neither did it pique my interest very often. There were some plot points that I really liked, and some of the things that happened to the characters made me feel a little sick with sympathy, but the rest seemed like a reasonably straight line of progress, as if point A and point B were the dangerous/interesting parts, and the rest of the book was just getting there as plainly as possible.Perhaps I missed things because they were in the slower, less interesting parts of the book, but there are some things that I wish had been addressed in the narrative. For instance, at the beginning of the book, Lulu and her mother are 'chasing' the man who is supposedly Lulu's father, Mr Fred Cowper. Lulu has no idea if he really is, but at some point in the story she begins saying that he is, and I don't think he ever gave her a clear answer of whether he was in fact her father. I wish there had been more conversation between them, though I understand that the characters were kept away from each other for the most part. It still would have been nice. There are a few other things that I'd have liked elaborated, but what was really missing for me was the emotions. Lulu's mother is lost within the first chapter or so, but I don't recall Lulu mourning her at all. In fact, I don't remember any mourning for any of the characters who die, and while it would be practical to try and keep calm in a zombie apocalypse, a large part of the book was about humanity, and I felt the prose lacked a human touch to it. While the characters face tense and frightening situations, the narrative doesn't really describe them as fearful. The story is in first person, but Lulu hardly addresses her emotions at all.I would recommend this book to someone who likes action novels, or someone who likes zombie novels, but I would also warn them that there are parts of the book that lack either. A good chunk of the novel is spent in a zombie-less submarine, and that is when the book really seems to slow down. While I'm not likely to pick up the (kind of) sequel, this is still a pretty decent read, and for anyone wanting to give it a try, I would definitely say to go for it. I liked it, not as much as I'd hoped, but far more than I'd expected."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/112377-kim", "userReview": "When I requested this book as part of the First Reads program, I was initially drawn to it by the combination of zombies and apocalyptic fiction, hoping it might be reminiscent of a recent favorite, The Forest of Hands and Teeth. However, Xombies is really a very different kind of book, both because it's science fiction rather than dark fantasy, and because it's apocalyptic rather than post-apocalyptic. Thus I expected to read a great deal more about how the zombie epidemic took place and less exploration of its psychological impact on the survivors. What I didn't expect was how little the zombies (actually xombies) appeared in this novel, which is really less a tale of zombies than of running from zombies, if that makes sense. Which was still quite interesting, except when it was bogged down by details of military protocol and life on a submarine.Lulu Pangloss has chromosomal amenorrhea; not only doesn't she menstruate, but she also physically looks much younger than her actual age of seventeen. Her childlike appearance has been used by her mother to manipulate men throughout Lulu's life, but the benefit of her condition really comes through with the coming of Agent X, a virus which changes women of childbearing age to violent, blue-skinned, flesh-eating zombies. The condition is then spread by these women to men; to her knowledge, Lulu alone is immune. When her mother is infected, Lulu must join forces with the man she believes is her father, and she travels by submarine to the remote north to escape the xombie plague.This book was honestly a middle of the road read for me; I enjoyed parts, and other parts I didn't enjoy, though I wouldn't necessarily call them bad. I don't read a lot of straight science fiction, and my eyes tend to glaze over when I read the word \"military,\" so when the older characters would discuss matters of intelligence and navy protocol, I got lost for a bit. I had a very hard time understanding how the effect of Agent X was so different on men and on women, and when Lulu's father said she was immune but not really, I didn't understand what it meant. When I do read science fiction, I expect that the science will be plausible if not possible, and I hope to understand it a bit. In Xombies: Apocalypse Blues, I didn't always, until the end----and then I didn't trust it. But I really liked Lulu, whose condition made her an unusually interesting protagonist, and who was both brave and thoughtful. I particularly liked reading about her treatment in all-male company, and enjoyed her interaction with the adolescent boys on board the submarine. I really enjoyed the exploration of gender issues, and would have enjoyed more of it, but I suspect there are readers who feel the opposite. It's just a matter of personal taste."}, {"userName": "Trupti Dorge", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1656694-trupti-dorge", "userReview": "Xombies\u2026What do I say about this book? I picked it up from a store because of the awesome cover and of course because it had Zombies. It does starts with some fun and gory zombie fighting that I was expecting from this book in the first place. The Zombies are created by a virus called Agent X which mysteriously affects women first.17 year old Lulu and an old guy Mr. Cowper flee from their homes and go to a Navy base to find protection with the navy. Cowper is supposed to be Lulu\u2019s father, the guy who ran away from her mother and someone whom Lulu had never met for the first 17 years of her life.Circumstances lead to Lulu and Cowper running away together. But what they find at the Navy base is not protection but hundred\u2019s of men and boys who Cowper suspects would be left behind once the Zombie defenses stop working and they invade the base as well. Cowper along with the men takes control of the Submarine which then sails (?) off to the Artic regions.So far so good. I was really into the story until all the zombies were wiped out from the Submarine. But after that the Zombies kind of disappear for almost 200 pages of the book. That would have been okay if the rest of the book would have been good. But the Submarine descriptions were very tedious and I found myself very disinterested after that. I couldn\u2019t picturize the descriptions and there was too much technical jargon. Honestly I skipped a lot of that section and it\u2019s a huge section of the book.The last hundred pages or so were really good but then again I was so bored with the middle section that I just wanted to finish the book. So I read the last 100 pages real fast which kind of led to me to missing out certain explanations of the Agent X that caused the Xombies. I found a few loopholes in the story but then again I said I skipped, so I\u2019m not sure they were really loopholes.The 2 stars are mainly because after the first 100 pages I lost interest in the book. Even the last 100 pages of the book could not revive my interest. But not wanting to be completely unfair, I will tell you what I liked in the book. I liked the writing style. The protagonist Lulu was a very street smart and intelligent girl whom I liked right from the start. The bond between father and daughter though not in the face was nicely developed. The Zombie sections, however few were awesome, so was all the action.All I can say is that this book needs major editing, especially for the Submarine part.This book is re-releasing this year with a different cover (which I don\u2019t like much) and title XOMBIES: APOCALYPSE BLUES, with the sequel XOMBIES: APOCALYPTICON coming out in 2010, I think.First posted at http://violetcrush.wordpress.com/2009..."}, {"userName": "Jenevieve", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5350268-jenevieve", "userReview": "Agent X has swept across the world and devastated the human race.

Problem is, most people don't see being turned into something akin to a zombie as salvation. Lulu and her mother have just driven cross-country in an attempt to find Lulu's biological father and have been shut up in a house with little access to news of the outside world when Agent X hit.

It's pretty hard to find books that start with X and a friend recommended it so I figured what the heck. I'm going to preface this whole review with the fact that while my oldest child is a Zombie-fanatic, I am not. I pretty much only read zombie anything in an attempt to be able to communicate and have some sort of discourse with him. As a result, I have read a few phenomenal zombie books (Newsflesh trilogy by Mira Grant springs immediately to mind) and some that made me want to claw my eyes out and marching across the house to ask him why he would read such poorly written crap. This one goes in the middle. It had some fresh new perspectives on the tired cliches but frankly, I never really cared for any of the characters. The lead was constantly going from whiny and annoying to ultra-capable and then back again. The rest were basically names thrown in to play the roles needed to move her along.
