Clapper. ****.This is one of those books that is a must-read for most all American citizens. It is a well-written expose of the life and activities of our former Director of National Intelligence. In it, he not only reviews the significant historical events surrounding America during the last 55-years (his length of service in the government), but provides his personal beliefs on the potential and real effects of the activities of the current Trump administration. Mr. Clapper wrote this book in collaboration with Trey Brown, his former co-worker and speech writer. Together they have done a remarkable job. Either they have a remarkable memory for past events, or one or both of them kept journals over the years. There were several events described by Clapper that I had forgotten about, or mis-remembered. Remember though, that this was a long period in our history. The first third of the book is more or less an autobiography, describing his family and his history up to his enrollment in the service. The middle third of the book is very much like an extended resume. The final third deals with present-day events and Clapper\u2019s views on them. He pulls no punches. Although I don\u2019t like to quote extensively from books that I read, I believe that the following paragraph summarizes his views. It is from his final chapter: \u201cFacts and Fears.\u201d\u201cWe have elected someone as president of the United States whose first instincts are to twist and distort truth to his advantage, to generate financial benefit to himself and his family, and, in so doing, to demean the values this country has traditionally stood for. He has set a new low bar for ethics and morality. He has caused damage to our societal and political fabric that will be difficult and will require time to repair. And, close to my heart, he has besmirched the intelligence Community and the FBI \u2013 pillars of our country \u2013 and deliberately incited many Americans to lose faith and confidence in them. While he does this, he pointedly refuses to acknowledge the profound threat posed by Russia, inexplicably trusting the denials by Putin about their meddling in our political process over the considered judgements by his own Intelligence Community.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Bettie\u262f", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1108123-bettie", "userReview": "James Clapper on Russia: 'They swung the election to a Trump win'.

Two generations giving their life, and in a sense the lives of their families to the service of our country. Service to protect us. General Clapper wrote this book and does media interviews to try to give honest information as best he can within the constraints of material being classified. He followed his father in a lifetime of protecting Americans. If you enjoy a review of out nations history, this book gives you that. When he gets to recent years, it\u2019s not just history that we obviously can\u2019t change. He gives us an insight of the current situation of the Russian threat to our elections - something we need to know. No matter what party you are affiliated with. We need to aggressively monitor and stop the infiltration of Russia into our US cyber soil.

The office of the DNI is a strange one in that at first glance it seems to offer a great deal of influence, however in practice the effect that the person occupying this role can have is entirely dependent on the willingness of the President to actually read the PDB (for which the DNI is entirely responsible) and use the DNI as an interface resource with the rest of the intelligence community. Frequently, when there is an intelligence issue that has little to do with the DNI it is nevertheless hung around their necks as they make for easier replaced targets than directors of the CIA, NSA, FBI, DIA, etc... Along with the pain of attempting to unify the fissiparity and fiefdoms in the intelligence community, this is very much the reason that since the inception of the role in 2005, there have been 7 DNI's (2 of them acting) with only one of them, James Clapper for nearly 7 years, making it to the 2 year mark in the position.Clapper's extended term in this role was occupied by great successes, some controversy, and a great deal of being thrown under the media bus (for so long that he quips he thought about changing the oil why he was down there...) for intelligence missteps or general lack of intelligence. From the successful raid on OBL's compound in Pakistan, the fallout from Snowden's leaks, the beginnings of Russian meddling in America's electoral processes; Clapper and the IC were frequently being lambasted for either having too much capability and spying on Americans or being brought before inquisitions wondering why we weren't reading the emails of terrorists who committed murder on US soil. This balance between national security and personal liberty is one that every DNI must contend with, and while I think he paints an overly flattering portrait of his work with this balancing act, he nevertheless handled it better (at least 3x better) than anyone else in this role.The final section dealing with Trump's persistent disdain for the IC is Clapper at his most candid and is right on the money. No one would ever say that our IC has been blameless in any given year, however, to initiate a combative relationship with the institutions designed to be your eyes and ears to the rest of the world, despite the things that Trump is \"hearing\" from \"many people,\" is to entirely miss the point of the work these professionals do. And then to continue this asinine working relationship by consciously deciding to remain blind in the area of foreign intelligence, an area to which Trump brought no knowledge in the first place, compounds a pre-existing ignorance while at the same time attempting to delegitimize an honorable profession."}, {"userName": "Robert Yaffee", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/76330306-robert-yaffee", "userReview": "This book is historically a very important book. Clapper contributes to ourknowledge of the factors turning the Presidential Election in 2016. He is the first to come to the conclusion that Putin's influence on that electionwas probably the decisive factor.  Although Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by a margin of about 3 million voters,Clapper explains how Vladimir Putin, with his botnets, probably swungthe election to Donald Trump. The Russians targeted the battleground (swing)states with their informational warfare so that the election was won by 80,000 votes in three states. Many voters were convinced to reject the othercandidate because of the propaganda generated by the Russians. According to Clapper, the American exposure to the Russian cyber and information warfare was much more than that. Although some people would not go so far, becauseof many other factors involved, such as the Benghazi investigation noise, Jim Comey's comments about Hillary Clinton after deciding not to file criminal charges against her, etc.. Clapper convincingly makes a not just a plausible, but a probable case, for the notion that the election was won by a margin of 80,000 votes in three swing states, each of which was targeted by the Russians. Voter exposure to the bot amplification of propaganda was extensive enough so that I am inclined to concur with fmr. Director James Clapper on this matter. Although we can't be absolutely certain about this, yet I believe that is likely that Clapper's claim is correct. I am reluctant to believe that so large a swath of Americans are of such politically pathetic sophistication, that they could not spot a snake-oil salesman pandering so much political drivel for so-long.

They balanced conveying his history with keeping things moving. Not that it\u2019s fast-paced but it didn\u2019t get bogged down and I never got impatient. It held my attention and I was quite eager to pick it up every day, even inpatient. And I wasn\u2019t left with that sense of disappointment that Comey\u2019s book left me with because his was so much less informative. With Clapper, you get details, as much as he\u2019s able to include. And you get his opinions about a lot of controversial things. It\u2019s a quality book.It\u2019s a memoir, it isn\u2019t a book about politics or social justice or even the IC. Except it\u2019s also about all of that. His writing partner, Trey Brown, did a good job of capturing Clapper\u2019s voice. He\u2019s such a straight shooter and it feels very genuine, clearly thought out and presented, with a lot of wry humor. Logistically, it was another larger print nonfiction books, one of several I\u2019ve read this year. Maybe the publishers think mostly old people will read it. That\u2019s OK with me, I\u2019m one of them now. And also someone finally included a glossary of abbreviations! I started General Hayden\u2019s book (not the new one, the one before that) and was annoyed that I had to make a list to keep up with him."}, {"userName": "Christina Knight", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/82349510-christina-knight", "userReview": "I haven't read the book yet, but I have read many of the most important excerpts from the book. I vividly remember thinking when the WikiLeaks releases began the same day that the Access Hollywood video was released, that something nefarious was going on. Over the following weeks with almost daily releases of WikiLeaks. I saw how they were dominating coverage on the networks, and distracting from the problems afflicting the Trump campaign. I remember thinking back then, that these releases were probably going to cost Hillary the election, because of their propaganda value in influencing undecided voters. Hillary lost by less than one % of the vote in the swing states that swung the election. Only a little more than half of those voters had to be swayed by the WikiLeaks releases for Hillary to lose.  Keep in mind that some democratic voters were demoralized by the WikiLeaks releases and stayed home. Also, some Bernie supporters were so angered by the content of the releases, that they either stayed home, voted for Trump, or voted for a third party candidate. The James Comey letter also had a significant role in Hillary's loss, but I absolutely agree with Clapper's analysis, that the activity of Russian influence, effected the outcome of the 2016 campaign. I also believe that there was a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russians, and I eagerly await the final report of Bob Mueller. I do not believe in god, but I do believe in Bob Mueller (and Trump is shaking in fear)."}, {"userName": "Dylan Tomorrow", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8140239-dylan-tomorrow", "userReview": "Beware readers, this is not a review, just an angry rant.I don't often 1-star-rate books I haven't read based on who wrote them, but James Clapper lied under oath to Congress about unconstitutional mass surveillance of everyone in the US by the NSA.

I\u2019m often a fan of history and not usually as appreciative of contemporary history readings. Nevertheless, in this case I enjoyed Jim Clappers memorable memoir in which he takes the reader through his 55 years of service primarily in government from basically a Private in the USMC to a LTG USAF General Officer, then finally a Political Appointee in both the W. Bush and finally in the Obama Administrations - his career path alone in the Intelligence field is fascinating, admirable, and filled with experience at every level in the Intelligence Community or the IC as he calls it. I\u2019ve heard the expression, which I seldom use myself, as it\u2019s and honorable monicker that I don\u2019t use lightly. Mr. Clapper is truly a Great American as he has given 55 years of service to his country - I truly admire that. I urge anyone interested in the IC community and current events to give it a read. He does a great job throughout but I especially commend him regarding Chapter 8, about Snowden and the last chapter 12, where he covers in a highly effective and scathing manner Russian interference in the 2016 election, Putin and the nature of the contemporary Russian threat, and finally the harm being caused to our democracy by President Donald Trump which is well documented and cogent in my view. Great Book in my opinion, but I already said that I suspect. I will end with thanks to my friends who recommended that I give it a read.

The book is written in a forced objective manner that you can expect from someone with the background of Director Clapper, but you can read a little bit that through some of the life events he chooses to highlight that he has trended towards being socially liberal and progressive while not officially mentioning any party affiliations. He ends with some current events experiences that are familiar from the news and can probably turn people off from reading depending on whether you agree or disagree. Regardless its an interesting and easy read and it flows very nicely."}, {"userName": "Tom Walsh", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/75825543-tom-walsh", "userReview": "A remarkable account of a remarkable life spent in the service of the US Intelligence Community.

In Facts and Fears Clapper traces his career through his rise in ranks of the military, the history of several decades of national intelligence operations, the growing threat of cyberattacks, his relationships with presidents and Congress, and the truth about Russia's role in the presidential election. He describes, in the wake of Snowden and WikiLeaks, his efforts to make intelligence more transparent and to push back against the suspicion that Americans' private lives are subject to surveillance. Clapper considers such difficult questions as, is intelligence ethical? Is it moral to use human sources to learn secrets, to intercept communications, to take pictures of closed societies from orbit? What are the limits of what we should be allowed to do? What protections should we give to the private citizens of the world, not to mention our fellow Americans?
