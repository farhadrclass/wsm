This a mediocre book at best. Yes the writing is polished but my guess is the reason for this is the co author, who writes for the New York Times Magazine. The first 140 odd pages details what a grossly naive person Amanda Lindhout is and her narcissistic belief that she can do anything. She seems to be the one of the highest grossing waitresses on the planet without taking off her clothes, and seems to think that surviving Central and South America was justification for traveling to Pakistan, Afghanistan , and unfortunately for her ultimately Somalia. All this did for me was easily predict how her reckless behavior would end up getting her in trouble. I have seen reviews stating she got what she deserved. This assessment is grossly ignorant. Nobody deserves to be raped and tortured. The problem I had with the book is the first half is boring and as I said easy to see how the second half would play out. Having traveled to Europe, Australia, Hong Kong, and Mexico and Dubai, I have often encountered young travelers who think they can do anything with no repercussions. There is criticism the Canadian and Australian governments were less than effective is securing their release. I think people need to know that if you are going to go to countries that your government highly recommends that you don't, then if something happens to you it is not their job to help you. Other criticisms have pointed out that it seems like she purposely did this to get the fame of a once in a lifetime story, but ended up getting more than she bargained for, I doubt this is the case since it would be a great way to get killed! The biggest problem for me regarding this book was that after awhile I just didn't care about her or her ex boyfriend's ordeal. If she had a reason to be in Somalia like she was with the UN or a soldier, or with an NCO, I would say she was crazy to be there, but was hopefully briefed on the risks. But because she was either grossly naive and or ignorant, for me did not make this book worth the time I spent reading it."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "It's impossible to read this book without it weighing heavily in your thoughts.....Amanda Lindhout, held hostage for 460 days, in Somalia, made many stupid choices: she was na\u00efve and foolishly optimist....yet, those same qualities about her- may have been what kept her alive!!!Amanda is a fan of Eckhart Tolle. She mentioned reading \"The Power of Now\" ...which reminded her of being truly present in her own life --that it can be liberating from the past and the future -- and transform one's thinking. What Amanda went through was HELL. No matter what dumb mistakes she made - nobody should go through what she did!!!!Yet - Ms. Amanda Lindhout ...( her friend Nigel called her 'Trout')....bless her heart & soul if she didn't put to practice the skills of Eckart Tolle -when she needed them most: ..... to survive - with a sound mind. Eckhart Tolle says: \"Intense presence is needed when certain situations trigger a reaction with a strong emotional charge\". That's just what Amanda did: SHE WAS INTENSELY PRESENCE to a 'horrific' emotional charge. NOT EASY TO DO.....she had to have already been practicing 'Be here now' for some time....to stay calm -and be active in her thinking about surviving. This story is important-- Highly recommended if there are still readers left who have 'not' read this book. It's a real page turner, too!!! I traveled the Middle East at age 19. I, too, was young and foolish and made some dumb choices -- the only difference is I got lucky. My daughters got the death of fear put into them from me... THEY WOULD NEVER DO WHAT I DID. ( I'd chain them myself before I'd let them go to Somalia alone).

What Amanda went through during her 15 months of captivity in Somalia is about as close to hell on earth as anyone could get, and her story is at once many things: a remembrance of transcended origins and of lust for travel; a page-turning, ripped-from-the-headlines chronicle of a young woman's kidnapping; a portrait of the tragedy of religious fundamentalism and failed statehood and the astonishing inhumanity that they can ignite in men (and I do mean in men--not women). But more than anything, it's an unbelievably moving account of faith in one's self, how hope can save a life when all reasons to live have been obliterated, and how forgiveness and compassion are miraculously possible after unimaginable trauma."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30035966-angela", "userReview": "\u201cIt was a lesson the world had already taught me and was teaching me still. You don\u2019t know what\u2019s possible until you actually see it.\u201d Amanda Lindhout, a freelance journalist, was kidnapped while traveling alongside Nigel Brennan, a freelance photojournalist, in Somalia. The two were held captive for 460 days. Where they were starved, tortured, beaten, and Amanda even raped repeatedly. A House in the Sky is Amanda Lindhouts recount of the events that took place over her year in captivity. A House in the Sky starts off with Amanda's childhood. Going into the details of her struggles of being a child of poverty. Amanda's only escape from an abusive childhood was by flipping through the pages of National Geographic and pretending to be anywhere but where she is. Vowing that when she was old enough she would save the money and nothing would stop her from traveling. In her 20s Amanda started waitresses and saving all of her funds. After saving enough she started her travels and her career as a journalist. On one of her trips she met Nigel. The two continued to keep in touch and eventually started a relationship. With a long distance relationship proving to be too much the two ended up separating. Amanda continued to travel, doing her reporting work, and continued to keep contact with Nigel. Years and many countries later Amanda found herself wanting to go to Somalia and country named as the most dangerous place on earth. Knowing there was a war going on and about the terrible danger she could face she still decided to go anyways convincing Nigel to join her. This is roughly the first 150 pages of the book. These pages at first seem unimportant and are a bit sluggish. I was having trouble connecting with Amanda and found myself seeing her as being rather na\u00efve. I decided to push through and was very thankful I did. These pages though trivial at first end up being very important in the long run. Four days into their trip a group of masked men ambushed their car and kidnapped Amanda, Nigel, and the three men traveling with them. At the time Amanda assumes they are just being robbed, and held for a few days, but once the kidnappers force them to call their families and demand a ransom (3 million dollars for both of them) she realizes that this isn\u2019t going to be over with quickly. After the first 150 pages the stories starts getting into the heavy issues and reveals what happened to the two while being held. For the first five months Amanda and Nigel were able to be kept together. The two though starving and miserable, were for the most part treated \u201cokay\u201d. Once their captures realized that their ransom wouldn\u2019t be paid right away things started to increasingly get worse. The two ultimately decided to convert to Islam as a play to make their captures treat them better. Though this decision was probably in their best interest, it ultimately didn\u2019t make things much better, and the two were eventually separated and kept in separate rooms. The two come up with secret way to communicate and after they are told that the men that were taken with them are killed, they know they have to escape. The two over the next several days use nail clippers to chip away at a window in a shared bathroom. Once the two get out they run for what they hope will be freedom ultimately only having one person even attempt to help them. The two end up recaptured. The teenage kidnappers decide that Amanda, because she is a woman, is to blame for the failed escape attempt. Nigel instead of backing her up and helping her decides that since they are blaming her anyways that she should \u201cjust go ahead and take this one\u201d. Amanda is then locked in a windowless room with nothing more than a few useless items, and a thin mat. She is kept in the dark for weeks where she is starved, not allowed to speak, has her feet chained together, is beaten, tortured, falls ill to a bacterial fungus, and then is ultimately gang raped for her acts. She is forced to lay on her sides at all times because her captures think otherwise she might become too strong and will try to escape again. The only time she is allowed to move is when she is praying, which she eventually becomes too weak to do. Nigel is kept in a separate room with windows, books, and allowed time to go outside because he is a man. Over the next few weeks and months Amanda is continued to be tortured, raped, and one of her captures even tells her he plans on marriage her once the money has been paid. This is all happening while their capture\u2019s continue to call their families and demand ransom, sometimes up to ten times a day. With the government refusing to help pay ransom the families eventually seek outside help hiring a specialist to help get their kids back. After 460 days and 600,000 dollars being paid the two are released back to their families. A House in the Sky goes deep into what it is like being left alone with nothing but your own thoughts. It\u2019s about struggling, overcoming, suffering, forgiveness, and ultimately Amanda convincing herself that if she can just push through one more day she can make it. \u201cSee? You are okay, Amanda, It\u2019s only your body that is suffering, and you are not your body. The rest of you is fine.\u201d  At times this novel was hard to read and painful, but at the same time managed to take a tragic situation and make it beautiful. This story shows that the mind is a very powerful thing. A House in the Sky is one of those stories that will forever stay with me.

I'd received it as an ARC from the publisher. Read it in just a few days. Saying I'm conflicted is an understatement. Yes it's the true story of a Canadian woman who, while working as a photojournalist (or at least she thinks she is), gets captured and held for ransom along with a male friend in Somalia for over a year. She's half starved, beaten and raped before she and her friend are released. It's a story of courage, inventiveness, and faith. But it's also the story of naivete, foolhardiness, and lack of common sense. It's sort of like the stories of people hiking the Grand Canyon who are told by experts to stay on the clearly marked trails. But they think they know better, go off the trail, fall into the canyon, and then cry for help, not realizing that they're putting their rescuers in danger too. Not to mention the anguish for their families. Ms. Lindhout's book is compelling but would be a good discussion topic in an ethics class."}, {"userName": "Patricia Douglas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18495295-patricia-douglas", "userReview": "A true story about a young Canadian woman bitten by wonderlust who ends up in war torn Somalia because she fancies herself a photo journalist.

I was engrossed in the book once I started because I wanted to know what happened to her and read it through to the end just to finish it and see how it ended. But, honestly, I spent more time wondering what on earth she thought she was doing in Somalia in the first place having no credentials and no possibility really of doing anyone any good.

Memoir A House in the Sky by Amanda Lindhout is one of those books. Receiving the absolute highest possible praise of five and four stars from the Mindful Readers, this book is incredible. Amanda\u2019s rich, flowing, and relentless, beautiful writing takes you intensely side by side with her during her young life of travels, journalism, and long captivity in Somalia. There is so much sadness, so much struggle, so much extreme mind over matter within these pages; you are forever influenced, forever affected. But as you live Amanda\u2019s journey, as you laugh at times and yet cry over these words with her, you will witness the most glorious symbolic faith fluttering in sunshine. You will see determination and confidence raise a weakened yet courageous life upward into fierce belief. And once in flight, hope soars from that girl in chains on that dark floor and it humbles you, awes you over the amazing grace and forgiveness that is only Amanda Lindhout.

Late at night, I would search the internet for updates, hoping for good news, reading blogs that claimed to have answers as to where she was and wonder how on earth she would survive in such a desperate place. Amanda, prior to her kidnapping, was living a life that I found terribly appealing \u2013 travel, writing, adventuring\u2026and then to have it snatched from her like that was heartbreaking. Her story would not leave me.459 days after that day in August, Amanda and Nigel were freed. I celebrated with a glass of wine that night, willing that Amanda would be okay. Freedom finally, but what kind of survivor would it take to overcome the days and lifetime lost in captivity?This August, in a serendipitous moment, I won an advance copy of Amanda\u2019s book, \u2018A House in the Sky\u2018, written with Sara Corbett, from goodreads. I actually took a breath before opening it.See, Amanda, upon her return, did not disappear into the shadows. She took her experience and decided to create change that would directly impact the lives of the very community and country that so changed hers. Far from spewing hatred towards her captors, Amanda took a road of forgiveness ( admittedly not an easy one ), recognizing that her captors were born into the violence they inflicted on her and that no good could come of any of her suffering and loss if nothing changed.Amanda, months after returning home, founded the Global Enrichment Foundation. Originally focusing on educational initiatives for women in Somalia, this foundation continues to create development and aid in Somalia and Kenya to this day.This is the background that I had, upon opening \u2018A House in the Sky\u2018. I think I anticipated a harrowing account of her time, with well chosen words but with things left unsaid. Perhaps that is what I had hoped for, because sometimes not knowing grants you a certain permission to not feel as deeply as you should.What I fell into immediately was the honest and raw story of a woman and her family. From the opening chapter, Amanda threw away any pretense of dancing around her life and how she ended up where she did and, ultimately, where she is today. Her story details the depths of loyalty and love and how you survive when both are challenged in ways you think unimaginable. And when the unimaginable becomes the reality, how Amanda finds the way to keep her mind and self intact is a testament to the strength of women in turmoil and desperate times everywhere. The idea that there is a house in the sky for every person, a place so filled with love that it\u2019s non reality overshadows and envelopes the sadness and pain of a reality is beautiful. What drove Amanda into the rooms and hallways of that house in the sky will leave you shaking and angry.I thought I knew Amanda\u2019s story. I saw her speak in Ottawa a few years ago, and actually ran into her in the washroom before her talk. She had just come from an interview, where the interviewer had pushed her on areas of her captivity that she was not sharing at the time, admitting that the event had thrown her a bit and that she needed a minute to regroup. Her honesty and reaction to this unkindness ( my word for what the interviewer did ) but willingness to continue with her talk that evening should have been an indication of the power that this woman has inside her. Amanda went on to move an entire room of people minutes later, speaking candidly and with a raw hopefulness that astounded me.This raw voice of hers is found in \u2018A House in the Sky\u2018. And it is powerful. No detail of her captivity is left wanting\u2026you can smell and taste the rooms where they were held, you can feel the pages of the books she turns. Amanda writes about a woman in her book, a stranger who fought for Amanda with no thought for her own safety, acting with the understanding that to not act would have been such a great wrong, that the sisterhood they shared, even as strangers, was valuable and undeniable. You can see her eyes. Amanda honours this woman with her foundation, hoping that kindness and education ( and aid and development ) will somehow shift the terrible situation that produced the terror Amanda lived. And survived.There is so much more here, in this book. Friendship, love, choices, determination, self worth, the drive to survive is all bound up in a terrifying but ultimately freeing story. And that it was and is real? Experienced by a 27 year old Canadian woman? Almost unimaginable.Go anywhere. Fall in love. Make mistakes. Be kind. Forgive. Know that you are strong enough. Make change. Be hopeful. These are the thoughts I am left with, after closing the book. There are others of course \u2013 the baseness of human brutality, cultural realities that scare me, how governments work in our lives, the role of women in society, the feeling that there is so much work to be done in so many places. In all this, Amanda leaves her readers with hope, hope for change and hope that despite what she has been through that life holds for her so much more yet.I have never written a book review before. I hope that I have not held back too much on the story that Amanda and Sara have shared. Many details can be found on the internet and in newspaper clippings, but the depth of what this woman has survived should be experienced. Many of you have followed this story for years, with me. Know that the full story only moves you more deeply.\u2018A House in the Sky\u2018 will be released on September 3rd, 2013.( full review, with links, here - http://angelaauclair.wordpress.com/20... )"}, {"userName": "Diane Yannick", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1253673-diane-yannick", "userReview": "Get past the part where you blame Amanda for entering Somalia. Yell at her for her wanderlust and her feelings of invincibility. Be mad at her for not setting goals for herself other than elite waitressing to earn enough money for her next trip. Find her as unlikeable as you want. Bash her for the way she treated/used her men friends. Tell her there were other ways to cope with the abuse she witnessed in her home. Yeah, she was a half-assed Canadian journalist mostly interested in seeing the beautiful parts of the world that many consider uncivilized. AND she wasted a lot of human and monetary resources by being so foolhardy. Then blame her for Nigel's kidnapping. Try to resist writing a review about how depressing this book is. (For heavens sake, didn't you read the synopsis?)Then, when you're all finished with these rants, reopen the book and read a truly unbelievable and inspiring tale of a young woman who was brutally tortured for fifteen months by men who raped and prayed with equal fervor. This all happened in 2008. Amanda's curiosity and quest for adventure got her into a horrendous predicament yet also allowed her to survive. She was able to endure starvation, brutal beatings, physical deterioration and repeated rapes. Her spirit, tenaciousness and belief in the future allowed her to endure what would have destroyed many of us. She clung to Eckart Tolle's teachings and created a house in the sky that would allow her to envision beauty filled with people she loved. \"In my mind I built stairways. At the end of the stairways, I imagined rooms. These were high, airy places with big windows and a cool breeze moving through. I imagined one room opening brightly onto another room opening onto another room until I'd built a house...\"So it was she lived in the sky of her mind. With extreme attention to detail, she becomes a Muslim hoping to humanize herself in the eyes of her captors. She maintains communication with Nigel against many odds. An especially tender moment was when they exchanged creatively crafted Christmas presents.This book is a straightforward retelling of events. It is detailed enough to haunt your dreams. After their failed escape, I almost lost hope for her survival even though I knew she lived to tell the tale. Without the gruesome details of the captivity, I would not have envisioned the squalor and the personal cost of clinging to hope in the face of fear. Yet she lives to forgive those her abused her. She continues to face her banana peels, those things that \"unwittingly trip an internal wire\" in her mind opening the \"floodgates of fear.\" This book helped me to understand a world of depravity that I never even imagined.I hope that it helped Amanda to expunge a few of her demons."}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27709782-jen", "userReview": "I read this prior to joining GR and hence a late review but as I pulled this out for my husband to read, I thought I must write something as this has stayed with me.

As I read, I wondered both how this story and the publication of memoir passed me by. Did I perhaps read a snippet in The New York Timesin the fall of 2008, shake my head in momentary worry and sadness, and move on to Presidential election campaign squabbles, forgetting all about the plight of Amanda Lindhout? I certainly won't forget her story now. A young woman, blithely tripping about the globe, in search of direction, meaning, identity and adventure, becomes a prisoner by means of her own ignorance, arrogance, and good intentions. Growing up in Alberta, Canada with a single mom whose much-younger boyfriend terrorized the family with bouts of drunken violence, Amanda found an escape route in old copies of National Geographic. In those pages filled with images of the Hindu Kush mountains, the tropical forests of Indonesia, and the vast plains of the Serengeti, Amanda dreamed of a life less-ordinary, of finding the freedom that is unique to the traveler. At the age of twenty, she begins a series of extreme adventures, funded by episodes of waitressing at high-end restaurants in Calgary. Traveling as cheaply as she can, she set off for months at a time\u2014traipsing through South America, South Asia, Africa\u2014full of spirit, but without direction. It's only after she takes hold of a camera that Amanda Lindhout finds a calling as a free-lance photojournalist. She cuts her teeth as a stringer in Afghanistan, and then takes a job as a correspondent for an Iranian-run news channel in Baghdad, a job which earns her the scorn and contempt of nearly every other Western journalist she encounters. Shamed by her own na\u00efvet\u00e9, she decamps to Kenya with the intention of inserting herself into the war in Somalia. Days after she and a former boyfriend, photographer Nigel Brennan, arrive in Mogadishu in August 2008, they are kidnapped by a group of heavily-armed young men. Amanda and Nigel spend the next 460 days in brutal, soul-crushing captivity. This book is a narrative of two parts, two very differently constructed narratives\u2014what I call Before Captivity and After Captivity. Before Captivity is a series of events, a \"First this happened, then that happened\", with largely shallow self-reflection. Truly, it is an honest mirror of Amanda at this time: an earnest, brave, determined young woman without direction. Her only goal is to move away from where she is and what she might become if she remains standing still. After Captivity is a shattering coming-of-age story of a woman in physical, emotional and spiritual crisis. How Amanda survives her ordeal is not only her story, but a larger story of war, poverty, and faith. This is an anguishing read. The abuse Amanda sustains at the hands of young men for whom she comes to feel tremendous empathy is graphic and wrenching. But the story she and co-author Sara Corbett tell is a vital one: to understand how the soul transcends while the body suffers.

Part of the reason might have been personal interest, as a Canadian journalist for whom Amanda Lindhout's kidnapping was top of mind throughout her captivity. Irrespective of any additional impetus that may have lent to tear through the advance copy's 367 pages, A House in the Sky is a tightly written, compelling, and surprisingly balanced account that illuminates Ms. Lindhout's life in a way that news reports did not, and perhaps could not.In collaboration with Sara Corbett, Ms. Lindhout shepherds the reader along the path from childhood that led her to Somalia, and then through her experience in just enough detail to be engrossing and even heartbreaking, but not soul-crushing.Ms. Lindhout's emergence from her ordeal as an advocate for education and economic opportunities for young Somali women in particular ensures that her story ends on an uplifting note, but in the midst of her tale, that outcome is far from certain or likely."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Nov 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9626732-christopher", "userReview": "Ghost written account of a stupid and reckless young Alberta women who ignored all advice to enter the lawless, warlord-divided and 20yr civil-war ravaged country of Somalia and who was kidnapped and held for ransom for 460 days with equally dumb Australian ex-boyfriend/wannabe photojournalist.I must congratulate New York Times writer Sara Corbett for corralling the flotsam and jetsam thoughts of the airheaded Lindhout. She managed to put structure and weave a simple plotline into the vapid, stockholm-syndrome addled commentary that appears to issue forth from Lindhout's mouth. The book appears to be modeled on Kulber-Ross's five stages of grief - denial, anger, bargaining, acceptance, and depression - but adds another only the reader experiences by the end of this book - relief. I have not read other \"proof of life\" kidnap accounts but suspect this is an economical (literary) treatment of the subject as there is so little self-reflection and insight provided. Lindhout does not paint a very pretty picture of her co-conspirator/ex-boyfriend Nigel Brennan either - and yet he has penned his own account that I have not read (but may to compare and contrast). [The Price of Life]Aside from Lindhout's \"Stockholm Syndrome\" tendency towards the end of her harrowing ordeal (I am not heartless, just holding her to account/laying blame where it is due).

And then there was her na\u00efve notion that she could travel to war-torn countries like Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia, etc., with a vain confidence that she would be fine. I could not relate.

It reads like a novel, like literary fiction. There is so much in this, I could see this being read in college classes. It is fast paced. I wanted to slow down to savor how amazing the writing was, but it was hard not to rush ahead. Several times I found my heart pounding--wanting to put the book down because some of the things this woman endured were so horrifying it felt like a punch to the gut. At the same time I simply could not put it down. For me, I know it is a great book if I dream about it at night after having read it for several minutes or hours that day. This stays with you. I say this is a great book because Ms. Lindhout and her co-writer hit on some very deep, very provocative and very harrowing human issues. It sounds so trite to say I cannot believe what this woman endured, but it is true. What happened to her is beyond anything my mind could conjure in its worst nightmares and yet, her voice is strong, compassionate and very powerful. I keep coming back to that word: powerful. This book is the physical embodiment of that word. This book will make you fall in love with and savor every second of your life, every second, every free breath, every moment that you are safe and unharmed. Everything. This book will change the way you think about people, about men and women and war, about what it means to be free. It is also absolutely terrifying. as a woman it was very, very difficult to read in many places. But I am glad I did. This is truly one of the most amazing, astounding books I have ever read written in part by one of the most remarkable and courageous women I have ever heard or known of."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18983476-bill", "userReview": "About 3 weeks ago a co-worker gave me this book to read. He warned me, \"It's brutal.\" Since it was non-fiction, this really scared me. While I was finishing up another book, I left A House in the Sky on the end table and watched it with weariness, as if it was a wild animal that would bite me if I got too close. After about 10 days of watching the book rest next to the couch, with the warning of it's profound brutality, I finally dug in. Oh my goodness ... brutal is an understatement. This book left me emotionally strung out and full of anxiety. The story was very well told without embellishing the acts of violence and described such courage and strength in the face of extreme physical and mental adversity.After my nerves settled down, I thought, if Lindhout can persevere through 15 months of captivity in squalid conditions, enduring starvation, rape, beatings and torture, surely I can endure the slight road bumps I encounter during my relatively comfortable life. I also thought, what god could possibly profess that it is permissible and acceptable to treat women this way? Is this why men act this way, using the excuse of god to dehumanize and denigrate women ... I can not comprehend this reprehensible behavior. The brutality made me feel so sad and angry.I highly recommend this book but be prepared for some very intense emotions. Despite my tingling nerve endings, I could not stop reading this book.

This was a tough book to read! I can't knock in down just because what happened to her was so horrible!!!!It is the true story of Amanda Lindhout and how she was captured and held prisoner in Somalia. In the beginning you meet Amanda, she's carefree, she's a traveler and she's not afraid to go where ever - dangerous or not! It set up in a way that I was not so sympathetic to her capture, apparently I was in the twisted mood?!?! It was an odd mix in the beginning because in some ways I was really wanting a bad-ass hostage book (not sure why???). But really it started out pretty clean and casual, with the obvious loss of freedom - it didn't seem too bad. I actually got a little bored. Months went by as her family worked on gathering up the ransom to pay for her release.Slowly but surely I got my wish and my reading pleasure went from interesting and tolerable to horrific!!!! If you really want to know what the fundamentalists do in a female hostage situation - then read this. But be warned. If you want to read a story of survival, read this.

As the book description says, it's the story of a woman who was kidnapped in Somalia. Though I respect Amanda Lindhout for raising herself out of a sad and difficult childhood, I did spend a lot of time saying to myself, (sometimes out loud) \"Wow, what a stupid thing to do!\" as she compulsively travels alone to dangerous flashpoint destinations. Amanda Lindhout is a traveler/cocktail waitress/wannabe journalist. For a few years, she's extremely lucky--people are nice, no one rapes her--until she travels to Somalia, where no one is in charge; the land of pirates, professional kidnappers, and Islamic fundamentalists--and there, her luck runs out.What did I learn from this book? A couple of things. What it takes, psychologically, to survive kidnapping and torture. Despite being treated like some kind of amalgamation of slave, war booty, and animal, Lindhout never loses hope, is incredibly positive, learns to leave her poor abused body and disappear inside her mind, and retains an almost kindly view of her kidnappers. (Yes. I was thinking Stockholm Syndrome, too.)This book served as a shocking reminder of the difference between Western civilization and fundamentalist Islamic society. It is almost a tragedy to be born female in a place where women are forced to walk around in shrouds, peering at the world through a slit in the fabric. It's heartbreaking even just reading about a society that forces those conditions upon fifty percent of their population. Lindhout isn't alone; she's kidnapped with a male friend, yet only she is beaten, raped, tied up, starved, scapegoated, tortured, forced to lie on the floor for months in a windowless, lightless room. In contrast, her companion, a hapless wannabe photographer ex-boyfriend, is given books to read, a room with windows, and the teenage kidnappers treat him like a buddy.Was Lindhout helplessly naive? Oh, yes. Will you shake your head in stunned disbelief as you read of her loony escapades? You certainly will. Will you make your daughters read it before you allow them to travel anywhere? Absolutely yes. What happened to her was tragically inevitable. But her clear-headed and beautifully-written description of her time in Somalia makes for a fascinating read."}, {"userName": "Cher", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4776032-cher", "userReview": "4 stars - It was great. I loved it. Somalia sounds like hell on Earth. I cannot fathom living somewhere that is so ingrained with violence, and the uncertainty that must exist for the citizens as the law and who is in control changes hands so frequently, perhaps even depending on what part of the country you are in at the moment. I cannot get the image out of my head of the woman that tried to help Amanda in vain, at the mosque. How difficult of a life the innocents in that country must have, as they are hostages of a sort as well, in their own country and the only place they have to call \"home\". Home should be a safe place for everyone.I didn't want to read this memoir as I feared it would be gory, graphic and painful to read, but I'm a book club trooper. It is not nearly as difficult to read as I had feared and the author does a great job of \"fading to black\" - she lets you know what happened but also spares you many of the details.The author's tenacity and ability to hold on to hope, love and even forgiveness in light of what she went through is incredibly inspiring. I don't believe I would have fared as well, but hope to never have to endure that grim test. For starters, you will never find me visiting Somalia. Never. The fact that Amanda continues to go back to that country where she was abused by a few, to help the needs of many, is humbling.Amanda and Nigel:-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: I've realized that the world is, in essence, full of banana peels - loaded with things that may unwittingly trip an internal wire in my mind, opening a floodgate of fears without warning.First Sentence: We named the houses they put us in."}, {"userName": "Anna Graham Hunter", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/339575-anna-graham-hunter", "userReview": "I can't shake this book. I stayed up late reading it and woke up at 3:30 the next morning because I couldn't stop thinking about it. It's hard to recommend, because it's the most brutal and horrific story I've ever heard from someone who lived to tell about it. If it were graphic or sensationalistic, it would have been easier to handle. Instead, her restraint and self-awareness make it heartbreaking. She said it took her and her journalist co-author three and a half years to write it, and that shows. The choices she's made since she got home make her one of the bravest people I know of. Yet what I can't shake is knowing that - despite all her efforts to use her experience as a force for good - she still has to live with what happened to her every day. I hope she makes millions from this book and from a movie deal so she can fund her foundation for the next hundred years and pay back her family members who lost everything to pay her ransom.

How do you critique someones harrowing life story when you have no writing ability, and have not been through anything even closely related. This fiercely strong women has opened her heart and showed her pain and suffering to complete strangers. I don't want to do a disservice to her story with my inadequate words or trite commentary. Please forgive me for my inadequacy and just do yourself a favor and pick up a copy of this harrowing, yet beautifully told book. Amanda, I admire you and at the same time wish I had the power to make the rest of your life blessed to overcome the violence you faced. Your strength of will and of character is to be admired and your courage and ability to forgive is something we should all strive for. You give me hope for the future. I am so sorry when we met that I knew nothing of your past. I would like to go back in time and just hug you - I know that isn't much, but I am not a hugger by nature if that means anything.  deeply personal no holds barred Inspirational Couldn't put this down Never a moment of poor me - she speaks frankly about her background and her ordeal, without ever putting blame on anyone Haunting - this book is still with me eventhough I finished it early June Fascinating and informative Inspirational  Hope and Forgiveness are the main messages she want to get through to the world Takes what happened to her, and instead of letting it take hold and bring her down, uses it to try to bring around change and to help this from happening to others SPOILER - The chapter dealing with her attempted escape sickens me. However, the sheer courage of one of those involved who tried to help does a least give me a little hope but at the same time breaks my heart for her probable fate This will win awards my friends. The collaboration between Ms Lindhout and Ms Corbett is seamless and perfectThe Not So Good Stuff Had to find something to put here - would have liked to know more about Amanda's life since the ordeal Cover is sorta blah (not sure if that will change for finished product)  This is hard for me to say, but I have to be honest, whenever I read tales like this it makes me think even more poorly about that part of the world, and this makes me feel horrible. I am the type of person who wants to believe that there is good in everyone.

Still, I wrestle with the little girl who rejected common wisdom costing tremendous loss to herself and many others emotionally, physical and financially. Amanda\u2019s life choices became more understandable after reading the first chapter of The House in the Sky. As a reader, we are introduced early to the dysfunctions of Amanda\u2019s formative years. Her fears were justified and pervasive resulting from a lack of stability in her home. Immersing herself in the escapism of National Geographic offered a refuge. As Amanda became a young woman, her fears were conquered by stepping into the ideals she imagined. She travelled the world with an unchanged western worldview projecting what she wanted to believe about the world from her glossy childhood images. Even after months of being kidnapped she speaks about her plans to escape and find the authorities \u2013even with her captives\u2019 insight on their political frustrations and motivations in a country still very much run by warlords. Amanda\u2019s arrival in Somalia with no insurance, formal identification as a freelance photojournalist, and lack of experience defied common sense. Her white skin and being female itself made her an easy target. Was it naivety or ambition or both that motivated her decision to take on Somalia? It is hard to say. The outcome was clearly predictable -although what she suffered evokes a physical inward call of outrage. Her strength and endurance were remarkable.  Amanda\u2019s story is told with clarity. Sara Corbett\u2019s writing is gripping and descriptive without being explicit with some of the more painful detail. How Amanda is writing her current life chapter shows how tragedy can be redeemed to something good. Her contrition for the cost of her poor choices seems genuine. I can only hope that the book serves other young travellers well with wisdom. Amanda\u2019s premature conclusion that government and media warnings are overstated was one of ignorance.

I appreciated how the memoir was able to show us how she changed as a person. I'm always amazed when someone is able to do that, start writing a book from the perspective of the \"old\" you, and very gradually change this to the new you.

A lot of reviewers judged Lindhout for being so reckless as to go to Somalia. She was young. I understand wanderlust. And I'm not so old that I have forgotten the feeling of being immortal, that only the young have. So that part doesn't bother me.But there were a few things that did bother me. Despite everyone raving over the writing, I thought it dry and factual. Like reading a text book. The book had no mystery to it. You know from the jacket that she's kidnapped and you know she survives because she wrote a book about it. It felt a little icky to read to just find out how much torture she endured. And this is purely my opinion, but I didn't like the way she portrayed Nigel. (I don't even know Nigel, maybe he's an ass). She was always saying how scared he was (of course he was scared!)...and that she was the one that kept him going...and when she was tortured and he wasn't, it almost seemed she begrudged him this. I rarely got any real vulnerability from her in the book no raw emotion, just facts. (This was maybe the writing) Yet plenty of her observing Nigel's weakness. All in all, a harrowing story.

Amanda Lindhout is from Alberta, Canada. As a young child living in a turbulent household, she collected and cashed in bottles. And what did she spend her money on? Old National Geographic magazines. Amanda escaped into the pages,dreaming of one day visiting the exotic places pictured. At nineteen she has saved enough money from waitressing to make those dreams a reality. Her first trip abroad is to Venezuela. \"I had seen this place in the magazine, and now we were here, lost in it. It was a small truth affirmed. And it was all I needed to keep going.\" Lindhout repeats the cycle, earning, then travelling. She visits most of Latin America, India, Burma, Ethiopia, Syria, Pakistan, Sudan and dozens more. Her joy in exploring and experiencing new places and people is tangible. But, each trip she takes is a little further off the beaten path. And finally, she's travelling to some of the most war torn countries in the world. In Kabul, Afghanistan she begins a career as a fledgling freelance /journalist/photojournalist - with no formal training, associations or contacts. With some success under her belt, she heads next to Baghdad, Iraq to work as a reporter for Iran's Press TV. Moving on from there she decides to head to Mogadishu, Somalia in 2008 - bigger stories might help her career take off faster. She wonders if an old flame, Nigel Brennan, an Aussie photographer wants to join her. He does.......and four days after their arrival in Somalia, they are kidnapped by insurgents from an Islamic fundamentalist group. And, they are held.... for 460 days. \"It was here, finally, that I started to believe this story would be one I'd never get to tell, that I would become an erasure, an eddy in a river pulled suddenly flat. I began to feel certain that, hidden inside Somalia, inside this unknowable and stricken place, we would never be found.\" A House in the Sky is Amanda's recounting of those 460 days. She is beaten, starved, chained up, kept in the dark, raped and tortured. These are the facts. \u201cThere are parts of my story that I may one day be able to recover and heal from, and, to whatever degree possible, forget about them and move on. But there are parts of my story that are so horrific that once they are shared, other people\u2019s minds will keep them alive.\u201dHow she survives is a story that had me tearing up, putting the book down and walking away from it so many times. It's a difficult read, but is such a testament to the human spirit and will.  Amanda names each of the houses they are held in - Bomb-Making House, Electric House, Tacky House and more. But it is the House in the Sky that had me freely sobbing - at the worst of times she builds a house in her mind, filled with the people she loves and the memories she treasures, the future she dreams of. \"I was safe and protected. It was where all the voices that normally tore through my head expressing fear and wishing for death went silent, until there was only one left speaking . It was a calmer, stronger voice, one that to me felt divine. It said, 'See? You are okay, Amanda. It's only your body that's suffering, and you are not your body. The rest of you is fine.' \" The journey to their release is gut-wrenching, incredibly powerful and impossible to put down. I stopped many times to look at the smiling author picture of Amanda on the back, wondering how in the world she survived. Survived and forgave. And as I turned the last page, I just sat. Sat and thought. This is a book that will stay with you, long after that last page. Read an excerpt of A House in the Sky.

As a child, she escaped a violent household by paging through National Geographic and imagining herself in its exotic locales. Now she would see those places for real. She backpacked through Latin America, Laos, Bangladesh, and India, and emboldened by each experience, went on to travel solo across Sudan, Syria, and Pakistan. In war-ridden Afghanistan and Iraq she carved out a fledgling career as a TV reporter. And then, in August 2008, she traveled to Mogadishu, Somalia\u2014\u201cthe most dangerous place on earth\u201d\u2014to report on the fighting there. On her fourth day in the country, she and her photojournalist companion were abducted.An astoundingly intimate and harrowing account of Lindhout\u2019s fifteen months as a captive, A House in the Sky illuminates the psychology, motivations, and desperate extremism of her young guards and the men in charge of them. She is kept in chains, nearly starved, and subjected to unthinkable abuse. She survives by imagining herself in a \u201chouse in the sky,\u201d looking down at the woman shackled below, and finding strength and hope in the power of her own mind. Lindhout\u2019s decision, upon her release, to counter the violence she endured by founding an organization to help the Somali people rebuild their country through education is a wrenching testament to the capacity of the human spirit and an astonishing portrait of the power of compassion and forgiveness.", "title": "A House in the Sky: A Memoir", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17860372-a-house-in-the-sky", "average": 4.22, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1376475295l/17860372.jpg", "reviews": 3883, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6572575.Amanda_Lindhout", "name": "Amanda Lindhout"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/308917.Sara_Corbett", "name": "Sara Corbett"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Biography", "Travel"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17860372-a-house-in-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18039963-a-house-in-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16145887-a-house-in-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16130477-a-house-in-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17860629-a-house-in-the-sky"]}
