I want to say that is probably the case, but the truth is I constantly read these books and I tend to enjoy them as a general rule.So what happened? The writing is lovely. It drew me in from the start. I was curious about the story and I certainly could not complain about the cool cover. But it took time for me to understand why there was tension between the characters,Someone died. Who died? Oh, his brother. Really, how? Well, you\u2019ll have to wait until I\u2019m ready to share that part. Oh, come on, I\u2019d like to understand now, not later. But I\u2019m not ready to share that with you! And what\u2019s up with his father, what\u2019s going on? It\u2019s complicated\u2026I felt confused a lot. And even when I wasn\u2019t anymore, when the hero finally decided to shed some light on issues, I realized there is absolutely no plot and the little boy is just wandering around, making connections, pretending to be okay, trying to live on after the tragic death of his brother, doing mundane things like buying gifts, \u2026.I was not so interested. Lolly is a boy I really wanted to connect with, but he made it so hard, because he\u2019s not open about his emotions and he\u2019s so quiet, calm and reserved that I couldn\u2019t get to know him through his entourage. I don\u2019t know if anyone, except maybe his mother, even knows him very well.Couldn\u2019t finish it. Was bored.

I love this book for taking place in an afterschool program, for honoring play and creativity, and for the hilarious sweetness of the characters' perspectives. Oh, and did I mention it's LGBTQIA friendly in the chillest of ways? EDIT: OK, after reading a few reviews, I see that some folks are concerned with the way Lolly and his friends talk to and about one another. To me, that honesty is a strength of the book. Kids his age would crack on Butteray and Rose (at least initially) b/c of their own insecurities and need to fit in. Depicting the behavior is not the same as condoning, and it makes Lolly much more realistic to me."}, {"userName": "Nat", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33068354-nat", "userReview": "I feel like it takes a lot to be surprised by a realistic fiction novel anymore... and The Stars Beneath Our Feet definitely did (surprise me, that is), but slowly; as slowly and methodically as a twelve-year-old constructing a city out of Legos. I finished it yesterday and needed to think before reviewing about what was most valuable to me about it. Here's what I've settled on: the plot was both creative and believable, the main character was a twelve year old I could both root for and recognize, the messages were both important and without preachiness, and the relationships in the story felt both intentional and pure. This is a balanced novel, y'all.

Lolly has a new pair of sneakers from his mostly absent dad and he\u2019s not about to let the two older boys following him snatch them off his feet. But when Lolly quickly turns the corner of 125th Street and 8th Avenue, the two boys abruptly stop, because Lolly lives in a world of imaginary protected borders, each border guarded by its own crew, and crews know better than to cross those lines.Lolly, who is West Indian, lives in the St. Nicholas House, a public housing project on West 127th Street, with his mom and his mom\u2019s girlfriend Yvonne, a security guard in a large toy store. His older brother, Jermaine had gotten involved with a drug dealing crew and was shot and killed outside a Bronx nightclub just a few months back and, while Lolly is still trying to come to terms with his loss, he is also trying to resist the pressure to join a crew.One thing that Lolly does like is Legos, and he has painstaking put together all kinds of kits, following the instructions to the letter. But late Christmas Eve, he takes them all apart, suddenly wanting to built something else, something of his own. Later, when Yvonne comes home on Christmas morning, she has two garbage bags full of Legos for Lolly, and just in time. Pretty soon, Lolly has built a castle so big his mom is complaining about how much space it is taking up, so he is allowed to build in an empty storeroom in the after school program he goes to, run by Mr. Ali, an understanding, but underfunded social worker.Soon, Lolly is joined by Big Alice, a special needs student suffering her own family loss, and who never speaks to anyone, but stays by herself reading. In the Lego room, she helps herself to Lolly\u2019s Legos (Yvonne brings him more and more bags full) and begins building her own buildings, which resemble their neighborhood perfectly. At first, Lolly resents Big Alice, but soon the two are taking trips into midtown Manhattan, exploring the different buildings found in a architecture book Lolly was given for Christmas. Eventually, the two begin to build Harmonee, an enormous alien world, together.All the while, Lolly, and his Dominican best friend, Vega are being harassed by the same two boys who followed Lolly on Christmas Eve. Part of a crew that wants Lolly and Vega to join them, they soon resort to violence as a means of persuasion. And it almost works\u2026but then things in Lolly\u2019s life take another totally unexpected turn.The Stars Beneath Our Feet is a debut novel for David Barclay Moore. It is an all-to-realistic coming of age contemporary novel, and Lolly is a wonderfully flawed character full of contradictions (like choosing Legos over video games). As Lolly tries to reassemble his life through the metaphor of Lego building blocks, life on the city streets is also becoming more and more complicated. Luckily, Moore has surrounded him with people who are caring and supportive - his gay mom, Yvonne, who is trying to help him through the grieving process by giving him Legos, the only thing she can do, Mr. Ali, who has recognized that Lolly needs to work through the trauma of losing his brother so violently, even his dad comes through, though not as much as Lolly would like. And their story threads together with those of Lolly, Big Alice, and Vega make this such a full-bodied novel.Harlem is also as much a character in this novel as anyone, providing a living backdrop for Lolly\u2019s important slice-of-life story. But, the danger those street hold for young men of color like Lolly isn\u2019t something most people know or even think about and Moore has captured it with brutal honesty, compassion, and even humor. From the moment I started reading The Stars Beneath Our Feet, I could\u2019t put it down. It may not be a book for everyone, but it is certainly a worthwhile read and, I think, a real eye-opener for many. Moore\u2019s final message in this novel - it is not just family, but also community that can help change things for kids. This book is recommended for readers age 10+This book was an ARC received from the publisher, Alfred A. Knopf"}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9781252-amy", "userReview": "So, I feel like this will be an unpopular opinion, but I just was not that impressed with this book. What I hoped was going to be a clear Middle Grade alternative to the other rock star texts Dear Martin and The Hate U Give , but it was nowhere near those books, IMO. While the subject matter was similar (a young black boy in Harlem is dealing with the death of his older brother and trying to figure out what to do with his life-art vs gangs), the writing and character development was lacking. The story was choppy. The character was unlikable at times, and not in a way that made you hope for his growth or change, but just in a way that made you annoyed with him. His friends were shallow character sketches that never felt fleshed out. The side stories did not develop enough to feel relevant or important.In the end, not for me. Right now I have it on order for my library, but am not sure if I will keep it or not since I wasn't that impressed."}, {"userName": "Katrina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4925006-katrina", "userReview": "2.5 stars. This book is kind of all over the place. We have: a dead brother, a gay mom, an absentee father, a girl with autism, legos, architecture, and gangs. Did I mention the girl detectives and the coyote?(!) (Fortunately those turn out to be a very small side plot, but I was really wondering where we were going for awhile!) And somehow even with all of that stuffed in, nothing really happens. There's not much of a plot, it just kind of meanders around. There's way too much dialogue that seems to be included only to show \"how people talk\" without achieving anything in the scene. And the end gets awfully preachy."}, {"userName": "Wesaun", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33684209-wesaun", "userReview": "Disclaimer: I have no knowledge of changes that have occurred in the final version.I am not a well-read reader when it comes to middle grade novels and so this book did not suit me so well due to the level at which it was at.\u00a0But this was a book that I wish had been put in my hands when I was in that middle-grade books stage, just to see black kids not for any other reason.\u00a0This book and its characters came alive with its cast of marginalized characters. I loved reading a book with children that were so...real and delightful. I loved the descriptions of Lolly's world and the adventures that he went on.\u00a0I loved seeing his evolution throughout the story and seeing him grapple with the darkness within himself.\u00a0That was something that I want to spend time thinking about and that I personally haven't really seen in the books that I have read. I have seen characters deal with dark circumstances and insecurities, like anyone else. But dealing with the darkness coming from within that sprouted from those circumstances, I don't know if what I am saying will make any sense or sound any different but it was different.\u00a0Moore made it so...fresh even when parts could come off as trite. I loved how for most of the novel though some parts were shorter than others, most of it wasn't filler.\u00a0The varied vernacular was...stimulating from time to time. I loved Rosamund, especially. She was beautiful and complex, though I am unsure of the accurate representation of autism, sometimes it made me uneasy, and am not sure how correctly it was done. Someone else would have to weigh in that was actually autistic.Now for the things I didn't love. Some circumstances in the last few chapters seemed unnecessary and gave off an annoying, filler vibe. \u00a0There was a cast of queer characters within this novel. If I'm giving Moore the benefit of the doubt, I would say it was to normalize or to include a realistic variety of characters considering the setting is where one might expect a variety of people.\u00a0However, the way these characters are portrayed is unsettling. Moore chose to include caricatures. I wish I knew why.\u00a0These characters were not respected or treated with decency in this novel. They were constantly picked at, poked, and degraded. I'm not saying that that isn't real life. I'm just saying the way that was portrayed made me uneasy. He (referring to Moore) seemed to be\u00a0trying\u00a0to regard these characters with respect but failed miserably.Jonathan got constantly mentioned but almost no development or anything really attached to him besides being called \"limp wrist\" on repeated occasions. The reader will never learn much of who he really is, just see other characters make fun of him in what\u00a0maybe\u00a0is supposed to be affectionate but really just comes off as the characters being disgusted with him for nothing besides his identity. There was no breakdown of discrimination in this novel, at least when it came to Jonathan. There was no setup of characters saying these things and then someone speaking out against it. It just was \u00a0silently carried along and that validated it in a way that could be considered hurtful but maybe some would just shrug at. I don't really think it is a healthy thing for kids to be exposed to and could just perpetuate the cruelty of making fun of boys that come off in a way that is different than the others which always leads to bigger problems as we should all be well aware of by now.Aston Stewart was all right, in that the character seemed confident, but he was wronged in this novel every step of the way, by the other adults he interacted in this novel and subconsciously by Lolly? I found it very confusing especially considering Lolly's mother, which you will find out in the first pages of the novel, should technically be more accepting of Aston. I found the reactions when Aston was introduced appalling.Butteray Jones was made fun of which made me uneasy for kids like him reading this novel. I feel like any attempt to try to support him afterwards in this novel was half-baked and not well done in a way that would combat the already negative message and its impact. I don't think any of the malice in this book was intended,because no one could be\u00a0this\u00a0bad, but it is there and I found it nauseating and it was perplexing. I felt like there was some back and forth underlying message that ended up being unclear static.\u00a0It didn't fit to me since the book was going so well to stop every once in a while to include characters and basically knock them down.This book will end up, unfortunately, sending a message to children that are like the characters that were made fun of that there is something wrong with them. That they might be sort of accepted but remind them that who they are could never be, at least not completely and might encourage other children to make fun of them which, as I said before, always leads to more problems that keep on the hateful society that we are burning in now.And since the book is so lovely in other aspects, I found it a combination of deeply disparaging and confusing. If queer characters are just going to be made fun of, why even include them? It just clouds the positive message that you were trying to send with fat raindrops of negativity that might be found imperceptible to some but what about those who pick up on that message?\u00a0What then for them?\u00a0I hope that Moore improves his handling of characters not like himself (if that happens to be so and if not then I apologise for my assumptions that are based off of the book). No one can be perfect, of course, but this book would have been way better with a little help from sensitivity readers who would have caught these details. This book was, in the end, bittersweet. It was full of the potential to be beautiful and to bloom and bloom it started, and then suddenly stopped midway and wilted. I will recommend it but only for those who wouldn't be triggered or as deeply disappointed by this sort of message being put out during this time or those that do not notice or are not good at paying attention to details and reoccurring underlying messages."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32216499-amy", "userReview": "12 year old Wallace (Lolly) is grieving the death of his brother while trying to navigate life in St. Nick, the low-income housing development in Harlem where he lives with his mother.

Lolly wants to avoid gang life, but it is hard to see another path. Lolly finds support at a community center and from neighborhood mentors. The setting is vividly described and glimpses of a wide variety of cultural backgrounds (Dominican & Trinidadian to name a few) bring depth to family traditions shared with the readers.

Although his mother and her partner try to provide him with the support and love he needs, Lolly blames himself for his brother's death and feels the anger growing. Sometimes he even acts out his anger, something that surprises Lolly. Lolly loves building with the collection of Legos he's received over the years while his best friend Vega seeks solace in his violin. But both boys are increasingly drawn into the violence of their Harlem neighborhood as a couple of thugs harass them, try to steal their possessions, and persuade them to join their gang. Both boys come perilously close to making the wrong choices, but a surprising turn of events involving one of the adults in their lives sends them in the right direction. Readers will enjoy the interactions between Lolly and Rosamund Major as they try to build two different Lego towers ten feet high, going from enemies and competitors to friends over the course of the book. Clearly, love can save someone, but so can other pursuits such as art, music, and architecture. Who would have imagined that Legos could help someone dream of a brighter future and maybe help him save himself? Well, this book will make a believer out of its readers. The author has done an excellent job of capturing the sights, sounds, and feelings of this particular part of New York City in all its glories and dangers. Growing up on the mean streets of an urban area where even a trip to the bodega can mean watching one's back is never easy, something of which readers will be mindful. Even though the adults in Lolly's life do their best, they have no idea of the daily challenges he faces and the feelings that are swirling within, threatening to overwhelm him. Late intermediate and middle grade readers will relate to the characters here, including chickens and a coyote that somehow survive in the city. Some of the challenges of living in a city where landlords are less than responsive to basic needs such as electrical wiring are described too so that readers see how even life at home is not easy. As Lolly envisions another world, he builds his own, Lego brick by Lego brick. Despite the book's serious topics, there is humor included in its story as well as pain. I will eagerly anticipate more from this author who is covering ground that hasn't been frequently walked here."}, {"userName": "Melanie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6483009-melanie", "userReview": "The Stars Beneath our Feet is a captivating story of grief and growing up in Harlem, a place at once rich with family and friends but also treacherous, with gangs that pressure young men to join \"the easy life.\" Lolly is a heart-warming character, so honest his words sting, his voice abrupt at times and desperate at others, always seeking a way forward even in a world that seems to want to hold him back.

I thought this book was really good but also very important. A lot of middle grade books starring POC are historical fiction. It is really a breath of fresh air that a story like this was written in a contemporary time frame. While it does read a bit older at times than middle grade (theme-wise), the writing is right in the middle grade wheelhouse, and such beautiful writing it is.This book would be eye-opening to many suburban kids who really don't realize that a kid who is their same age, who also wants to make his parents proud, and with whom they might share a similar interest (Legos, architecture) could live in a place where his cell phone or jacket is stolen just because he is walking outside his neighborhood and where losing his temper at the wrong time with the wrong people might mean he loses his life as well. Lolly is a kid to cheer for, someone who represents thousands of kids who have the strength and the ability and the drive to make it out of the city - as long as the city doesn't knock it out of them first. I bought this for our children's department (ages 0-12), and I will happily recommend it to lots of kids. Truthfully, however, I will likely give a heads-up to parents that this book does include language that their kids might not be used to reading in their fiction (\"nigga\" is a prime example), derogatory comments about homosexuals (\"limp-wristed,\" among others), and even a sexual reference which will probably go over the heads of most of its readership (\"My bibi told me that if you do it with a girl before you're old enough, your thing will shrivel away like a twig in a fire\"). I hope that this book finds an audience."}, {"userName": "Melissa Mcavoy", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3327274-melissa-mcavoy", "userReview": "4 1/2 stars. Twelve year-old Lolly has a lot on his plate. He's a regular kid with a passion for Lego's, but, as he and his best friend Vega both know, the world of navigating his 'crew' divided neighborhood gets far more complicated once you are no longer a little kid. What makes it far worse is the loss of Lolly's older brother Jermaine and the absence of their dad Benny. But Lolly and his community have a lot going for them, and as circumstances push and test Lolly, he responds with creativity, grace, intelligence and charm. Kids of all circumstances and backgrounds will identify with Lolly and his efforts to navigate the beginnings of adolescence and place himself on the path to becoming an excellent adult.I appreciate the richness of several of the current middle grade offerings: Saturdays with Hitchcock, The Stars beneath our Feet, (more to be added soon)...Not only do the books explore the typical tween issues: friendship in a shifting landscape, incipient romance, relationships with parents and siblings, nurturing individual passions, they also explore the complex world beyond the self: the layered relationships among older adults, the concerns of aging, parenting and financial responsibility, the rewards of appreciating those who are different and the need to forgive and appreciate good intentions. Also much appreciated is the inclusion of sexual, racial and socioeconomic diversity as part of the natural background of life, not the heavy-handed center of an after-school-special style problem novel.Reviewed from an ARC"}, {"userName": "Jenni Frencham", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6906412-jenni-frencham", "userReview": "Lolly Rachpaul and his mom, residents of the projects in Harlem, are still grieving the loss of Lolly's older brother. Lolly's mom's girlfriend brings Lolly a garbage bag full of LEGO, and Lolly begins using his building as a way to channel his grief. He eventually moves his construction to the after school program he attends, and a classmate becomes an unlikely friend for him there. Lolly is trying to please his mom, control his anger, build his LEGO universe, and avoid being sucked into one of the neighborhood gangs which promise protection. This is an excellently written book. Lolly is angry because his brother died, and especially because they had an argument before his brother died and they were never able to resolve it. The director of the after school program is encouraging Lolly to work through his grief. The book's cover will definitely appeal to tween fans of LEGO, and the many difficult topics covered in the book guarantee it will find a place in the hearts of many readers.Recommended for: tweensRed Flags: Lolly's dad uses some less-than-politically-correct phrases to refer to the Queer community; Lolly and a friend are beat up by neighborhood bullies; racial slurs; Rose - a character on the autism spectrum - is teased by her classmates because she is differentOverall Rating: 5/5 starsRead-Alikes: Crossover, The Red Pencil, Dear Martin"}, {"userName": "Cynthia Parkhill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20616966-cynthia-parkhill", "userReview": "This was a very powerful story, for the tough choices that the protagonist had to make, but it was also inspiring to trace his development as an artist. When the story opens, Wallace is having to deal with the shooting-death of his brother, particularly with a sense of responsibility.At Christmas, Wallace receives a gift from a family friend, a book about architecture. Impulsively, he leaves off assembling Lego kits and embarks on an original structure. His mother's girlfriend brings home Legos from her job at a department store, and this helps his building to really take off.When it becomes too big for his family's apartment, Wallace moves his project to the storeroom at his after-school program, and a second student, Rose, joins him in building a project of her own.At first Wallace resents the intrusion, but he comes to accept Rose's presence.While this is going on, Wallace and his friend Vega have to deal with boys who threaten them and take their belongings, as well as navigate invitations to join the local gang, or \"crew.\"Because there are so many dimensions to this story, I think that a lot of middle- to high-school readers will be able to relate: not only with Wallace, but also with Rose, as well as other characters."}, {"userName": "Marathon County Public Library MCPL", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9426686-marathon-county-public-library-mcpl", "userReview": "Building epic cities with large garbage bags full of LEGO blocks is how twelve-year-old Lolly channels his anger and his voice since the death of his older brother Jermaine, the only real person he could talk to.
