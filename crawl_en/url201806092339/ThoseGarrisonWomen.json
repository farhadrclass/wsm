I picked this book first but then realised there was a previous book (The Three Miss Margarets) so I had to read that first. Usually the second book isn't as good but I found this book even better. It had the same beloved characters but the focus was more on a character (Myrtis Garrison) that was more in the background in the first book. Delving into her past gave us more insight about the Garrisons and how it affected all those around them down the line. My only negative is the same as the first book, it takes a few chapters to get into it. It can be a little hard to work out who's who in the beginning then you just go with the flow. Louise Shaffer has a wonderful style of writing that is very easy to read and flows beautifully. She effortlessly blends characters that are good, bad, wise, naive, smart, mean and funny. I can't wait to discover her other novels."}, {"userName": "Jill Robertson", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47962717-jill-robertson", "userReview": "'Those Garrison Women' by Louise Shaffer was a sequel to 'The Three Miss Margarets' which I read some time ago. Family secrets, a young women trying to escape her past, a romance, a crime.....
