It follows the exploits of our hero and the regime change ongoing around him. Typical of the writing of the time, there are a few outdated stereotypes that glare out during the reading.

This was Heinlein's first published novel, released in 1940. This is densely huge and a really brutal read. It was amazing, but droneish at the same time. Deals with tons of shit: Religious themes, Police-states, Sexual discovery, and Revolution!The best way to read this is to get the collection \"Revolt in 2100\" which contains books #19 #20 and #21. (If this goes on, Coventry, and Misfits.).Highly recommended! This is the seeming climax of the entire Future History series (or at least what the past #1-#18 stories were leading to)!"}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7208455-frank", "userReview": "If this goes on--- by Robert A. Heinlein is a short story by Heinlein. There\u2019s three major arcs in his story, the first of man\u2019s journey in space, the second is life on the moon, and finally Earth\u2019s politics a couple hundred years in the future. If this goes on--- begins the third major arc, and it is actually one of the more interesting arcs, and yet one of the (hopefully) most unrealistic. The story starts with America being taken over by a religious cult revolving around the physical embodiment of the reincarnated leader. The story feels deceptively short at the beginning, a simple love story between a boy and a girl, who are in a religious cult, but rather than being a simple short story, this is a far deeper story, which fully realizes not just the meaning but the depth of challenges that come from the idea of a revolution, especially a revolution from a religious form of government. While Heinlein glosses over a few areas of the revolution, he also shows a number of the perils which feel both true, and not just the typical tripe that most authors write about. Rather than just have a series of battles, the revolution is actually a multi-faceted affair where direct conflict is to be avoided. Imagine that, when fighting a larger number, you should avoid conflict. I won\u2019t talk about the second or third act further but both are quite brilliant, and the entire time I read and read to find out what happened next. It took quite a number of nights to read it, but I can say that this is definitely part of Heinlein\u2019s masterwork. Overall I would say this is the third best story in Future History, only bested by Timeline, and Methuselah's Children."}, {"userName": "Jim Carleton", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34817897-jim-carleton", "userReview": "I've read this several times over the years, but only in the version that is part of the collection, \"Revolt in 2100\", not the original Astounding Magazine version. I continue to enjoy it each time I pick it up although I tend to skim over it until I get to the more philosophical areas. As a polemic against religious extremism it still holds up well, but it tends to trip over its own feet, because it also supports extremism in other directions. This aside, it still serves as a morality tale for our times, in which extremist views of all sorts hold more and more sway. Another story in the above-mentioned collection acts as a nice counter-balance to this one: Coventry tells of the actions of man who, after being banished from civil society, discovers a plot against it and risks his life to warn of the danger, thus redeeming himself. Taken together as a form of Yang and Yin, the clear message comes through: the actions of individuals will always matter."}, {"userName": "Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7784002-christopher", "userReview": "A good story, but not one of Heinlein's best.
