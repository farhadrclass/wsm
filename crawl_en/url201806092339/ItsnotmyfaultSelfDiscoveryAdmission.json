These are more glimpses than short stories, most of them are funny, some sad. I also need to give a warning: the book contains quite a few sexual situations to be unsuitable for people younger than 18 years. It is not exactly politically correct, so people who are easily offended by this should avoid the book, it is not for you. For the rest of the readers you can check the free sample to see if this book is for you. The book gets 3.5 star rating from me.

Yet, like the theater's twin masks, there is a subtle undercurrent of tragedy in the humor. Not enough to be a buzz-kill; and not always obvious, either. But it underlies the stories nonetheless.What appears as less-than-perfect editing adds sincerity to these first-person narratives, which is noteworthy since the author states they are not autobiographical.\"It's Not My Fault\" is not for everybody. But for those whose sensibilities are not particularly delicate, it is an entertaining read."}, {"userName": "Naomie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7231003-naomie", "userReview": "Arguably the trashiest book I have ever read. Filled with alcohol, sex, alcohol-driven sex and the everyday doings of a self-coined 'dumb slut', this book had the oddest, most cringe-worthy moments (those Olympic Games) to the most aggravating moments where I wanted to jump up and strangle the male characters for being so chauvinistic. In fact, my main problem with the female lead was actually the way she let men walk all over her. Contrary to popular belief, women are people too.Otherwise there were some moments of such randomness I couldn't help but laughing, although at times I was tempted to just throw the book in holy water considering the filth I had just read. Do not take the warnings lightly.Overall a light-hearted, rather tongue-in-cheek and dirty book. I think my IQ level dropped a few points after reading (there were some rather horrible grammar issues and oddly synthesised phrases) but if you ever feel your life is a train wreck, read this. You'll feel better very soon.*received with Goodreads First Reads)"}, {"userName": "Edwina Callan", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17316622-edwina-callan", "userReview": "I received this book from the Author in exchange for an honest review.An un-funny-gross-out-fest.I was not amused.Child Abuse is never funny, nor is Animal Abuse, or The Holocaust, or Racism, or STD's, or ...I could go on and on.But, hey, if *Hygienically Challenged* people with roaches in their bed is something that you would find funny then maybe this book is for you.(She takes the term \"White Trash\" to a whole new level.)"}, {"userName": "MaryEllen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21623933-maryellen", "userReview": "I received a free copy of the eBook in exchange for a review.this book was complete trash. it is not even close to what I normally read. when I started reading it, I thought I was wasting my time.that being said, the more I read, the more I enjoyed it. very funny and entertaining trash. :)"}, {"userName": "Fran", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1032865-fran", "userReview": "Wendi Bear: It\u2019s Not My FaultLife brings us many unique and different situations. It\u2019s how we handle them, carry ourselves and work through the difficult times that make us stronger, smarter and hopefully wiser. But, sometimes the narrator shares many experiences with readers that many might find humorous, sad, and fearful and some wondering why she managed to remain in relationships that would create a downward spiral and others that would prove disastrous. Throughout the book we hear her voice as she meets many different men, describes her encounters with them and then recreates many of the intimate times they spend together making the reader wonder why such a bright, intelligent and creative young woman would even think to associate with any one of these men. Love comes to those who work at it and even then it might not last forever. Hearing the narrator\u2019s voice as she describes her up and down relationship with three men that stand out the most, Donut, Brutus and Redbeard, each man appears to have his own agenda in mind when it comes to her. Each man sets the limits in their relationship and each man puts the brakes one when things get too serious. The mother of two children who need her guidance and whom she provides for should take a quick look in the mirror and realize that there is more to her than what others are seeing or meets the eye.From her experience getting a Boob Job, the end result not so successful to dealing with a man named Butterball, you wonder about what she was thinking. Acceptance, fitting in, feeling loved and wanting someone she can count on in her life is what I think she is fighting and hoping for. Going to cosmetology school, becoming a hair dresser a great start but drinking her way through many of her days and nights more than just destructive and definitely not the way to go to succeed. The chapter that really hits real hard is the one with Cliff where she was spending her birthday with him and the way he treated her and the fact she forgave him makes you realize just how much she wanted to be loved and who did not really matter. Cliff disappeared many times and returned when he felt like it. He even cheated on her while they were away. Another chapter that was quite telling and describes her relationship or lack of one with her parents is the one where her mother wants her to ask the Reverend of the Church she attends for money to pay their rent. This chapter you have to read for yourself to learn just how this impacted her as a young child and how much she lost at the end. The narrator has a heart of gold when it comes to anyone hurt or any animal in need of help. Read Tiny the Turkey and find out what happens when she sees an injured dog. We learn more about Donut and his attitude towards her, her willingness to bend over more than just backwards to keep him in her life and in his bed. One story that hits hard deals with a school performance that her mother would not attend and her feelings about not getting picked for the Holiday Hoedown. Relating that to an event in the present we learn that not only did her mother let her down she almost did the same to her son, PJ. Learning more about this woman we find that she is consumed with her needs, her feelings and finds it necessary to have the support of any man in her life just to feel wanted and satisfied. Girl friends come and go, partying, getting drunk, cocaine and avoiding many of the real issues in life, the main character seems bent on losing more than just the battle with alcohol and finding the right mate but possibly the connection with her children that most parents need and want. Having no source of money, Donut out of her life, Redbeard moving on, the narrator often resort to getting drunk, taking jobs in different clubs and finding herself dealing with men most of us would steer clear of. Added in she relates how she got started at the age of fourteen, met Redbeard, her life on the streets for two years, her estrangement from her parents and an operation that changed her life. A mother that never really showed any signs of love or support and a father who refused to nurture his daughter, it seems as if she is and was bent on a road of self-destruction trying to prove she needs no one yet wanting anyone. The flashbacks help the reader understand the life, the rationale behind her thoughts, movements and why she often did things without giving any thought to the consequences. It\u2019s My Fault: Just whom did she blame? Which men would she have been better off without and why was she so fixated with Donut? He is definitely one Donut that should remain on the baker\u2019s shelf or in the donut box untouched. A family cruise that was more like a nightmare. Meeting a man named Pepe and stealing him from a friend. Abused, betrayed, belittled, insulted and yet she keeps coming back for more and forgiving the wrong people for whom she should stay away from. A brother who gave his family a scare and a situation that should have brought them together. Others could serve a young woman who did not seem to really care about herself as a person but only her childish needs, which she felt. Wait until you read the craziest things she ever did and where! From being with Red, Redbeard, Laverne, Shirley, Pepe and many others the journey is long, hard, and difficult and definitely would fill many bottles, glasses, liquor stores and jugs with tons of whiskey, vodka and much more. So, where is she now and who is her main partner? Read the Epilogue, read the last chapter and find out whether she learned anything from her own thoughts, experiences and friends. This is one book that will either make you laugh, make you wonder why someone that has something going for her would allow herself to be used and abused by anyone and would not realize that some donuts belong in the boxes with the powdery sugar and others need to be permanently tossed. Filled with real life experiences that Wendi Bear shares with readers from her own blog and with the help of some great friends. It\u2019s Not My Fault if you like or dislike this book but you\u2019d be missing something quite unique if you don\u2019t read it.Fran Lewis: Reviewer"}, {"userName": "Cate", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11595581-cate", "userReview": "WARNING: This book is not suitable for readers under 18, and those with blinkered opinions. It is not a book that is intended for everyone, a fact the Author makes clear from the start in her own words, but it will definitely make you think.Most of the tales in this book are funny, but shockingly so as the Author takes the reader on a journey through the train wreck of her life, in her own words. As this is a compilation of random events, fuelled by alcohol, sex and drugs, there is obviously no character development; and there are no moments in this book where the light goes on for the writer, and she thinks to herself \u2018why am I doing this?\u2019 In fact, as I read on through this book, it didn\u2019t have the shock value I assume the Author was hoping for, it actually made me sad and wonder why the writer allowed themselves to be treated in such a manner.Each disastrous relationship, drink induced destructive act and drug propelled incident is written in excruciating detail in this book, but while it may seem just an exercise in self-pity on behalf of the Author, it is actually someone writing something cathartic that may help themselves, or others who suffer this kind of life, to come to the realisation that this is not all life has to offer. I could forgive the horrible grammar, and badly put together phrases, as this is not and most likely will never be a great piece of writing, as I felt that these errors actually added to the overall feel of the book.The Author has a heart of gold when it comes to the under-dog, be it an injured animal or a fellow human in need of help. In this we see that, despite everything else that is happening to her, and she is letting happen to her, she is trying to do some good to others in some way in her train wreck of a life. This leads the reader to see that the Author is consumed with her own needs to make a difference, to feel wanted in any way possible whether that be by depending on men who just use her or avoiding many of the real life issues that we all face by hiding behind her substance abuse. Whatever, the reasons for writing this book it is apparent by the time the reader turns the last page, that this Author is losing the battle she is fighting on all fronts; or is she? To discover this you have to read the last chapter to discover the answer to this question.Whether you agree with these kinds of life choices or not, this is a book you need to read to help you understand that your life is probably not as bad as you think it may be. I would recommend this to the more mature readers, as I feel that they would have a greater understanding, if not acceptance, of the driving forces behind the Author and not be as quick to judge her.Originally reviewed on: http://catesbooknuthut.com/2013/10/10...\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6173409-rebecca", "userReview": "This book is clearly not intended for everyone and it can certainly be considered offensive, but the author makes that clear from the start.Bear begins with a text conversation between two people who are casually having sex. The story turns to the Breast Milk Olympics between two women who had just given birth. It is a rather bizarre story, but she makes it funny. You won't believe me unless you read it, but it's entertaining.Some of the ideas that are expressed are quite original and Bear is able to make the reader laugh by her original views on life.\"When my big day arrived, I was happier than a homeless man who'd found a twenty.\" (28) I do have to say that some of the stories were completely repulsive, but some were just hysterical. I loved the story about bikini waxing and the story about online dating. \"I want you to know, men do not read your profile. Nor have they any clue what you are really looking for. Much like a small child, they only look at the pictures.\" (88) I could see that being true, for sure.I could relate to some of the content in the story about the cruise ship. I understand her about the casino and that the comedy shows are not funny. Most of them are just vulgar. Side note: vulgar does not equal funny. The humor needs to carry the story, not the vulgarity. Bear does a good job with balancing the two.Bear puts herself down a lot, possibly for laughs, possibly to defend her actions by stating that she knows that she isn't perfect and has made some dumb decisions. People can relate to that. The author also had put a disclaimer in the beginning of the book stating that it is fictional, but the reader clearly knows that it had to be (somewhat, at least) based on personal stories/experience.\"That's when it happened\" (or something close to that) was a little overused, but clearly, the author was trying to make the reader continue reading, and it worked.The language was a bit harsh but it goes with the genre. I kind of knew what I was getting into before reading the book. However, I find it difficult to respect someone who drops her kid(s) off at their grandparents' house or a friends' house - last minute - just so she can go out (all night) with a guy she hasn't known for long at all. I know it was supposed to be humorous when she would say things like, \"I did what any (insert an insulting remark about herself) would do...\" But it became rather repetitive at times, even if it was meant for emphasis.The author/main character had a difficult childhood, to which I could not relate. I suppose she is trying to make the best of her life and not base it solely on how she was raised. And look at her now with a published book and lots of fans. Overall, it is a funny (but vulgar) book intended for entertainment, which ultimately was successful.Also, I hate donuts, too."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15401397-mary", "userReview": "WARNING: This book is not suitable for readers under 18.It\u2019s not my Fault : Self Discovery & SubmissionThis novella funny, crude, and risqu\u00e9 .

Sexual partners are written about like old road trips - yeah the tire blew out, but what a view of the desert. It's a singular experience to find yourself alternately laughing maniacally in near-disbelief at some of the situations written about, then alternately smiling as you recall your own not-so-successful attempts at hooking up, or having drunk sex, or being the best judge of character. This is a memoir about the sexual creature in all of us, warts and all (literally), and although few of us can account to having had quite the libertine youth that Bear has had (few of us would dare!), we've all been drunk, we've all been careless, we've all been reckless and out of our element, and it's refreshing to have these phenomena reflected on with a buzz and a joy and a gleefully naughty nostalgia with which they are rarely written."}, {"userName": "Reader Gal", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22880423-reader-gal", "userReview": "Wild alcohol-fueled sex. Check. Outrageous drunken escapades ending in sex. Check. Sex + alcohol = this book*.This realistic first person confessional takes you under the covers and beyond. You feel as though you're reading someone's nasty diary. You feel a little dirty yourself for continuing to read, but, like a car accident unfolding in front of you, you can't not look. That is its strength. You feel for the main character (whose name is *****). Some of the stories make you want to hug her, some make you want to shake her, and some make you want to barf. Or, all too often, all three at once. Though the author disclaims that this is a memoir, even insulting the reader for wanting to read \"this piece of trash,\" it feels personal. The incidents, people (sleezos and friends) and memories/feelings of the main character are rendered very realistically and believably. Warts and all!What's missing? Sober reflection, compassion -- both for herself and the world around her, self-knowledge, plot, oh, and the kids. Yes, children. They are mainly referred to as annoyances who must be babysat while she cavorts. The humor isn't really missing, as she tends to find most everything kind of funny, but would be a whole lot funnier after a bottle or two of Pinot Grigio.

I have seen too many people that feel exactly as this book describes the narrator. It is not a pretty picture, in my mind. While I did find parts of the book funny, for the most part, I do not find \"put downs\" of either men or women enjoyable. I honestly found myself feeling bad for a person that did not seem to be finding anything redeemable in life. Perhaps this genre just is not my type of book. While some will find this book hilarious, others will feel as I do, that it is degrading to women and men. It is, in my mind, the story of someone that has been disappointed too many times. Their lives have been torn apart over and over, and they can not seem to catch a break. They are perhaps too trusting and naive. For some, this will indeed be the funniest book they ever read.

I got about 20% through it on my Kindle, and it's just a little bit too intense for me. Like reading about a porn star's relationships. I wouldn't leave a review, but I think I've gotten the gist of the book - correct me if I'm wrong, though!The book is separated into a *bunch* of short stories - like diary entries, almost. They tell of encounters with past love interests, of silly to poor decisions, of crazy drunk shenanigans. Like the synopsis says, it's a dirty book, which you'll either love or hate. I think taking it slow and reading one to two of the stories max is how I should've gone about reading this, because story after story of it gets to be too much. And then, I start spacing out/not really reading.There were things I liked about it. I giggled every time a story was ended with a particular word. There's a bit early on involving breast milk cannons (which makes no sense unless you read it). The writing itself is really good, I think I only remember two problems with words that shouldn't have been there or needed a tweak to work. And the naming of the guys in it, or rather the nicknames, is comical.I plan to pick it up again in the future to read a little more. I just need a break from it to go back to happy stories. I'll update my review/shelving when I do so. I may update the rating, too; I just can't give 4 or 5 stars to a book that doesn't grab me. While I can't say I'd recommend the book to any of my friends, that's because they have similar tastes in this respect. If you're looking for something raunchy and wannabe porn star-esque, pick it up."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4753262-jessica", "userReview": "***I was given a Kindle edition of this book for an honest review***I was intrigued by the book since the author was compared to Chelsea Handler and I found CH's books to be hilarious. This book was pretty funny as well, but so raunchy and a bit degrading to women. A little too much for m liking. The over-the-top content features short stories of relationships and life happenings. If you liked Chelsea Handler's books, you might like this. Be warned though: if you thought those books were bad, you should probably pass on this!"}, {"userName": "Nichole", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14067575-nichole", "userReview": "this book was definitely something thing different it made me laugh until my stomach ached and made even evaluate my own way."}, {"userName": "Branden Vanscoy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23314954-branden-vanscoy", "userReview": "A fun book. it's hard to describe it other than that."}], "description": "Prepare to laugh out loud at this politically incorrect novel full of short stories that are just plain wrong. You will be shocked, humored, amused and aroused. A provocatively original must read. Based on the popular blog, \"It's not my fault.\" A fictional story of a young woman who makes all the wrong life choices, told in a \"dumb blonde\" first person narrative, finding humor in even the most disturbing of situations. Appealing to the audiences of Chelsea Handler and Tucker Max and inspired by the antics found in the top UK comedy series, Absolutely Fabulous. A brutally honest account of obsession, sex and the abuse of alcohol. This book is not a memoir, it is a highly exaggerated piece of filth. Shame on you for reading it.*For readers 18+", "title": "It's not my fault.
