I'll admit that I found the other heroes in the Shadow series to be slightly over the top. But in an enjoyable way! Unfortunately, in SHADOW KEEPER, Giovanni was a very problematic character for me.My biggest annoyance happened in the first few pages of the book - so you can check it out in the excerpt link above. The short version is: when Giovanni and Sasha meet, Giovanni basically sexually harasses Sasha while holding her wrist so she can't leave the conversation. Over the course of the book the author tries to rationalize this incident (and the events that led to that) for Sasha and the reader by saying that Giovanni was injured so he's frustrated with not being able to do his job, that he is sick of women just throwing themselves at him because he has money, and also that he's never done anything like that before. Honestly though, those things are no excuse. Giovanni is in a situation where he has power over Sasha and this kind of behavior is not something that should lead to a relationship!I understand the difference between fantasy and reality, and I understand some people might find Giovanni sexy. But right now, in the political and social climate that we are in, I find that I wasn't able to forgive him for his behavior at the beginning of the book, no matter how good he was to Sasha later. If you read the excerpt and are willing to give Giovanni a chance, I think he does improve over the course of SHADOW KEEPER (though he's still pretty stubborn and controlling), and honestly, if him and Sasha had met in any other way, I would likely have had a very different opinion of this book.Outside of that, there were some things that I enjoyed about SHADOW KEEPER. I liked the family dynamics between the members of the Ferraro family, and it was fun seeing them more. Sasha was awesome - she grew up on a cattle farm and was both physically and emotional strong, so I enjoyed reading about her, and it made the stalker plot line suspenseful and engaging, because I was invested in her character.Ultimately, I was unable to get past Giovanni's behavior at the beginning SHADOW KEEPER, and that led to me being unable to believe Sasha would be happy with him in the long run. While I was disappointed in this installment in the Shadow series, I will likely give the series another chance, as I am interested in the other characters (who don't seem to be jerks like Giovanni). In the end though, I almost wish I hadn't read this one.Sexual content: Explicit sex scenes"}, {"userName": "Lover of Romance", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3709091-lover-of-romance", "userReview": "This review was originally posted on Addicted To RomanceI received this book for free from Berkley Publishing Group in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.So\u00a0 I have been addicted to this latest series that Christine Feehan has been writing, and I know there have been quite a few mixed reviews on these books and granted they might not be for everyone, however I would like to point out that they TOTALLY work for me in every which way and I am totally on board with this family, I just love the Ferraro's family and I became quite addicted to each of the books and seeing more hidden depths to this family.Shadow Keeper begins with Giovanni, who is the cover image of the family as the \"playboy\" ever since his leg got injured he is not ready to be working in the shadows, so he has to play the image that he HATES with a passion but has literally no choice because his family is everything to him. But then all hell breaks loose when he meets his woman, his mate, and yeah she hates him at first. All she sees is a man that loves fast cars and faster women and she doesn't need that drama in her life. She works as a waitress at one of the clubs that the Ferrarro's own but she overhears something she shouldn't have, and now Giovanni knows that if he wants any chance at all to court her properly, he needs to show her the real man beneath the cocky man he portrays to the world.Sasha grew up on ranch in Wyoming, where it was just her parents and her older brother. Her family was everything and she grew up out in the country where the only dangerous animal was a bull. She learned how to work hard and live a simple honest life. Until her parents were killed and her brother was injured with a brain injury that left him with no memory of her and she had to be forced to come to the city to work two jobs to pay for the best medical care for her brother who is her best friend. Once she meets Giovanni and his crazy family, she is drawn into a world that she doesn't feel comfortable with, but the man that she sees underneath that playboy surface makes her believe in love and safety again. But right when she and Giovanni are getting to a good place in their relationship...a dangerous stalker is after her and her man and both of them are in real danger....All this, Sasha. It doesn't mean anything without you. Nothing I have in my life means anything without you. I live hard. The things I have to doo are sometimes very difficult. I do them because it's my duty, but I've never had what I needed to make it all worthwhile until I found you.Boy, I had a blast with this book, it was quite different from the previous two books. I truly adored this heroine, because she is so down to earth and sweet but feisty. I love how she stands up to people and not afraid to defend those she loves. She is a fighter and you see it in how much she cares for her brother who can't remember her but still, every spare moment she has is with him. I do love her strength and inner courage that is manifested in this story and she is probably my favorite heroine of the series so far.Then we have the fun interactions with the Ferraro family, and boy some drama from Eloisa (who is the mother and so crazy) but really, what she does in this book is simply horrible and yes one of my favorite moments was seeing Sasha stand up to her in such a great way that made even the mother afraid of her. But we also get hints for future books too, and I am so curious to see which sibling will be up next. What I have loved most about this series though, is seeing this close-knit family just come together through the good and the bad times, and always be there for each other no matter what is happening.The romance that develops between Giovanni and Sasha is simply so endearing and strong, I love how right they are for each other. They each have strengths and weaknesses but seeing them realize how compatible they are is wonderful. Neither of them are perfect and they both have flaws and seeing those flaws balance each other out so well was simply so wonderful. You \"FEEL\" their connection so effortlessly and once again I am reminded why I adore this author so much.I found Shadow Keeper to be a true winner of a read and is topping my list of favorites for the year....I just adored everything about this book and seeing this couple together in such a way was simply beautiful and I can't wait for more!!\u00a0 A TRUE JEWEL!"}, {"userName": "Joan", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4466562-joan", "userReview": "Outstanding! Shadow Keeper is the third book in the Shadow Rider series and with each successive book the Ferraro story just gets better, more exciting, and action-packed. This is the story of Giovanni Ferraro and Sasha Provis. Sasha has moved from her family ranch in Wyoming to Chicago in order to find the best care for a loved one. Giovanni and Sasha paths cross, of all places, in one of the Ferraro\u2019s nightclub where she is working as a waitress trying to support her brother, Sandlin, who is in a brain trauma rehabilitation center following a car accident that killed their parents. Sasha\u2019s love and devotion to her beloved brother speaks volumes of her character and as one born with \u2018shadow blood,\u2019 she fits Giovanni completely. But there is more to Sasha\u2019s family background that connects her even more to the Ferraros and the shadow riders. I liked Sasha because she is neither an abused or exploited woman; she is self-assured and good to others without ignoring her own basic needs. Giovanni is protective and devoted to his mate and gives her just enough space to be choose him for a lifetime. But along the way, there are enemies who set friends against each other and try to take out Sasha and the Ferraros. It was awesome spending more time with the Ferraros and seeing the progression of the stories of other characters. The five Ferraro siblings are characters I want to root for\u2026Stephano, Ricco, Giovanni, Vittorio (the enigmatic piano man), Taviano, and Emmanuelle (the only girl). I adore Emme and hope that she get to have what her mother missed out on, a man who adores her and who she can be open about with being a shadow rider. I am just not sure of the motivations of that Valentino Saldi, he seems to be toying with her heart and being that their Italian families are lifelong nemesis, the Ferraro\u2019s and Saldi\u2019s are modern Montague\u2019s and Capulets. Younger brother Taviano has to walk a fine line with the broken Nicoletta, a mate he will have to go slow with and find their way forward. Their dragon of a mother, Eloisa, makes a brash and bold appearance, castigating her children and their mates. But understanding more of Eloisa\u2019s frustration and never knowing that her husband loved her, her outbursts are understandable if not welcomed. Francesca, Stephano\u2019s wife, is the calm, reassuring stabilizing force in this family; she was the spark of hope and continuity for this family.Shadow Rider was such an enjoyable read. For me, reading fiction is about enjoyment and escapism\u2019 I love when the writer takes me on an exploration of new worlds with interesting stories, intriguing characters and most of all, the book needs to leave me feeling excited and wanting more. The Shadow series does that for me. I cannot wait for the next installment."}, {"userName": "Guilty Pleasures Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4391611-guilty-pleasures-book-reviews", "userReview": "Giovanni Ferraro is the star of Shadow Keeper and is a lethal combination of power, danger and sensuality. Giovanni is playing the playboy role since he\u2019s been sidelined with injuries and is unable to ride the shadows. Doing his part for family he\u2019s hanging out at their night club and when he spots a certain waitress, his heart unlocks by the right woman for him. Sasha Provis needs the work and waitressing on the top tier with the high rollers can give her the tips to help take care of her brother\u2019s care. The last thing on her mind is finding a man and of a love for her lifetime. Giovanni can\u2019t believe the wait is over and will do anything in his power to show and tell Sasha they are meant to be together. While Giovanni attempts to make Sasha his own, a stalker wreaks havoc for the couple and the reasons are blurred on whether this is real or not. Time isn\u2019t on their side which makes their time together even more important for him to show her how much she means to him.I absolutely fell in love with Giovanni and his way about him when it came to winning Sasha over. He can be badass one second and turn on the charm and romance the next. He had to get himself out of the hole with Sasha right from the start but you can feel the sincerity in his words and actions from then on out. He also had a sense of humor which only endeared me more to him. Sasha has been on her own for some time and it took some getting used to in order to put her life in someone else\u2019s hands. It wasn\u2019t easy and it took a life-threatening moment for her to realize her selfishness could have cost her everything. I love those moments and it was well written to get that point across. The Ferraro family is diverse and I love seeing them scattered throughout the story helping the romance along the way. Not only do we see the three remaining single siblings but you get an insight into their future stories and I can\u2019t wait to see who is next. I\u2019ve read several of Feehan series and loved the sense of family but the Ferraro family take it to a new level. They are extremely close and protective and would willingly do whatever it takes to make another happy. Shadow Keeper hit all the right places with this reader and deepened my love for her writing because she understands love and family. Shadow Keeper is a well-written, smoldering sexy story and a wonderful standout to the series."}, {"userName": "Minx -The Genre Minx Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40042696-minx--the-genre-minx-book-reviews", "userReview": "I am a huge fan of the Shadow Rider\u2019s series! There is something about the Ferraro family that I just love. Probably that they are misunderstood anti-heroes of sorts. I just love how the family deeply cares about each other and that they use their supernatural powers to bring a vigilante justice to those that have escaped consequences for their crimes. In Shadow Keeper, Giovanni Ferraro finds himself in a position where he needs to be the one in the limelight in order to keep the attention off of his siblings and cousins as they carry on with their vigilante ways.Giovanni was previously injured by gunshot and he is no longer able to ride the shadows due to metal placement in his leg that gives stability to the injured locations. Although he is hoping the metal to be a temporary measure there is a certain amount of uncertainty as to whether or not he will fully recover and this has put Giovanni in a bad place mentally. He knows that he is doing a good thing for his family and that until he can have the metal removed, this is all he can do but it is not something that sits well with him. It has also caused him to act out of character.Giovanni knows that he is acting like a scoundrel but it doesn\u2019t really matter to him until his rather unchivalrous attitude causes Sasha Provis to be rather disgusted with him. Sasha is a newly hired waitress at the Ferraro club but for some reason Giovanni was drawn to her and he did not want Sasha thinking ill of him. Despite trying to show her that he is more than what she thinks, she is very wary of him. Sasha does not want Giovanni in her life because she has enough to worry about with trying to make ends meet but when it becomes clear that she is being stalked by a dangerous predator she has little choice but to accept the help that Giovanni has to offer.As always with this series there is a high level of sensuality, tantalizing romance, and supernatural intrigue. There was an addition of a mystery element to this installment that had a creep factor to it and that was very cool. Also, there was a positive sibling relationship that was very sweet and endearing and I loved that aspect to it. Sorry, I cannot be clearer about that, ha ha, don\u2019t want to be a spoiler. Shadow Keeper is definitely a story that I will highly recommend to all readers because it has it all \u2013 romance, mystery, sensuality and a supernatural twist!This review is based on a complimentary book I received from NetGalley.

Christine Feehan has me over here fantasizing about shadows! Did that one just move? The Shadow series and the uber yummy Ferraro Brothers, will have you looking a little harder the next time you see a shadow move across your field of vision. Shadow Keeper is the third installment of the Shadow series, and I would encourage you to read them in order. While each story has its own arc, it will benefit you to have some of the back story from earlier books. Plus, the whole series has been great so you won't regret investing the time.The hero of this installment is Giovanni Ferraro, our playboy Ferraro brother. Or is he? If you have read the previous books, you will know that Giovanni was shot in the leg and has been unable to ride the shadows while he recovers. This means he is spending more than his normal share of time in the nightclubs being the \"face\" of the Ferraro family, and a distraction for their enforcement activities. When Giovanni finds his \"one\" - his fated mate - all those alpha male protective instincts come to the fore to bring his woman on board and agree to tie their shadows together for life. Now the Ferraro men tend to railroad their women until they accept the foregone conclusion that they belong together. While some don't like the pushy alpha males... they really engage in this behavior for all the right reasons, and you can't imagine a woman treated better than these heroines. I seriously love Feehan's heroes, they all tend to have the alpha characteristics in common, and I don't think I've met one that I didn't like.Our lucky heroine is Sasha Provis, a somewhat sheltered girl from the farm in Wyoming. Sasha was a very likable heroine. She was sweet and family-oriented, but she also didn't fear sticking up for herself or saying what she wanted. I loved the playful side that surfaced once she accepted Giovanni. In addition, she was a dedicated sister and did all in her power to provide the best care for her disabled brother, Sandlin. And Sandlin, dios mio, he just broke my heart.So the relationship between these two moves at a pretty fast clip, as is the tendency in the fated mates trope. I don't mind that. In fact, I am super happy when the fated heroine accepts her fated Ferraro brother and things start getting good. These alphas are super steamy and skilled, and I loved the play and banter between Sasha and Giovanni. The secondary storyline for Shadow Keeper involves a stalker who puts our heroine in danger. I felt like this was laid out very well and helped to advance the plot so that it wasn't all romance and sexytimes. The Ferraros do danger very well, and it makes them all the more appealing. Our future books in the series are shaping up to be explosive and dramatic, and I can't wait!I voluntarily read and reviewed an advanced copy of this book that I received from the publisher, Berkley."}, {"userName": "1-Click Addict Support Group", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22365152-1-click-addict-support-group", "userReview": "Can\u2019t get enough of the Ferraro\u2019s\u2026.I can\u2019t!

Really good. Yet each romance is unique and offers something new with each outing. Giovanni and Sasha may have had a bumpy first impression but I starting falling for them right away\u2026 Well, honestly, Giovanni had a head start\u2026As the \u2018face\u2019 of the family, Giovanni was playing a part, a role he was getting tired of.

Battling an unknown threat was difficult but no more than the effort to shake off a bad, really bad, first meeting. Giovanni and Sasha battled and loved through it all, with family always at their side. The men and women in this series are hard to describe as they each are so different in who they are and what they bring to the family.

I\u2019m so glad I took a chance and requested this one! My mind was made up when I saw it was going to be about Giovanni. I was always interested in his story and Christine didn\u2019t disappoint.Giovanni was hurt and can\u2019t ride in the shadows, so while he heals so he is to be a decoy in the media as a player while his brothers do the family work. Giovanni hates that he can\u2019t ride in the shadows and is sick of partying every night. He ends up seeing Sasha and knowing that he found his other half when their shadows connect.Let me get this off my chest, Giovanni is a damn angel and deserves nothing but good things in his life. He was nothing but pure and I fell for this character quicker than Sasha did. He was kind, giving (in more ways than one), and would do anything for Sasha. If you thought that Stefano was crazy over the top about Francesca, then let me welcome you to Giovanni. He thought the sun rose and set on Sasha and showed her every day. He also had a huge heart.Sasha moved to Chigao to get her brother the best help she could afford. He was in a car accident and was hit by a drunk driver years ago. She worked two jobs to afford the health center where he was. What she didn\u2019t know what that both of her jobs were in Ferraro territory. what I loved about her was that she didn\u2019t take any shit! She wasn\u2019t afraid to stand up for herself and wasn\u2019t afraid to defend those she loves. Remeber when I said that Shadow Rider had a ton of sex? Well, this book is dripping in it! The chemistry between these two was burning hot and was there from the first moment that they met. They couldn\u2019t keep their hands off one another!So the reason I couldn\u2019t give it 5 stars was because of Sasha. I know she wasn\u2019t used to the life of the Ferarros and was a little hesitant about falling in love Giovanni so soon, I get that! She stayed hesitant for a long time, but she was down to have wild and crazy sex with him. When Giovanni would tell her time and time again how he was crazy about her, she would turn it to sex. Although I did like her and thought she was a good character, at times I wanted to shake her like a rag doll.All in all, I really enjoyed this one!

This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.I was so excited going into Shadow Keeper. When I began this series I was a little apprehensive about the powers the Ferrarro family had. Fortunately over the course of the series I've come to better understand it and the way that the family lives.As seems to be a normal trend, at least in the books I'm reading, the men seem to know the heroine is their mate pretty much instantly. It's an immediate attraction. Unfortunately, in the Shadow Rider world, you have to be careful how close you get because if you spook off your potential mate, there are severe consequences. Giovanni comes pretty close to doing that when his mate catches him making up a pretty disgusting game with his brothers and cousins. He definitely deserved to be called on that!Sasha is a hard working, devoted sister who is just trying to help keep her brother alive. It just so happens her world goes into a tailspin when she meets Giovanni Ferrarro, the family and a bunch of rude, overprivileged celebrities. There is this whole new world that she doesn't understand. Then she is suddenly the victim of a stalker. But determining who it is along with who the stalker is really after is a mystery that investigating could get them all killed.I am loving this series more and more with each book. I found Shadow Keeper full of action, with tons of adrenaline pumping moments. We can't forget the developing relationship between Giovanni and Sasha. Sasha is full of fire and truly loyal to those she loves. I really enjoyed her character and loved seeing Giovanni try to win her over. Giovanni suddenly has purpose since he is still healing from that gun shot wound and finding his mate right now is perfect timing. At first his character really turned me off. Especially with his little game he made up, just like Sasha. But he wins me over and I see the passionate, loving person beneath his playboy persona.Shadow Keeper was a book I had a hard time putting down. I was sucked into the drama of the Ferrarro world and didn't want to leave. I'm really excited for the stories of the other family members. Especially Emme. She seems to be going through a really rough time and I want to see how that works out. Also there are interesting developments with Stefano and Francesca which is going to probably make Francesca's life miserable for awhile.The only reason I knock this down half a star is because I felt that the elimination of the threat to them all was so quick and effortless, that I almost forgot it happened and finished the book wondering why it was leaving it without closing out the stalker storyline. Then I remembered the brief scene and realized the book really was over and we only left one little thread open. I'm curious as to what happens with Aaron. Will the family be able to get him out of his situation? It seems like he was just left there at the end. Since he was such a good friend of Giovanni's I would have thought that they would have helped him out. Maybe I missed it being so wrapped up in the drama of the family and the couple's HEA. I'll definitely have to look again!I think that because this is Giovanni's story, and he can't ride at the moment, there were no other cases the brothers needed to work. That meant there wasn't as much riding as in the previous books. That is still mainly how the family gets to each other in record time, but it's not a main component to the story. You really only get the power the Ferrarro's have and what they do with it explained to you without seeing first hand how they handle a case. Although, the shadows were definitely used, as well as the phrase, to take care of the bad guys.This is a great series and I'm really growing to love this family. I even look forward to seeing what that mother Eloisa is going to do next. Shadow Keeper is definitely a one-nighter (if I could read that fast) and I highly recommend this series.This review was originally posted on Rantings of a Reading Addict"}, {"userName": "OpenBookSociety.com ", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3540731-openbooksociety-com", "userReview": "http://openbooksociety.com/article/sh...Shadow KeeperShadow Rider, Book #3By Christine FeehanASIN: B075C2FSKZAuthor Website: christinefeehan(.)comBrought to you by OBS Reviewer CaroSynopsis:The paparazzi can\u2019t get enough of infamous bad boy Giovanni Ferraro.

And his every touch takes her breath away.The devil at her heels may have finally met its match\u2026 (Goodreads)Review:As the third book in the Shadow Rider series, Shadow Keeper, ventures more into the lives of the Ferraro siblings, readers get an insight and more information of the shadow world, potential couples, and past events. In Shadow Keeper we learn of the outcome of events that happened in previous book Shadow Reaper as we see Giovanni heal from his wounds while he encounters Sasha Provis, the shadow rider he was waiting for.Fans of Feehan\u2019s books know that her male characters are always shown strong and unbreakable, but once in a while we see a different side to them. Giovanni is the middle child among his brothers and he has been portrayed as the playboy/party boy in order to take the paparazzi off of his brother\u2019s backs, but this time he shows his vulnerable side. He was previously wounded and can\u2019t go into the shadows. Playing the bad boy is getting tiresome and he is slightly starting to fear that he wont find his lifemate like his brothers have. The reader gets an insight of how it feels for Giovanni to be someone he isn\u2019t and the weight that brings him, so when Sasha comes along, he does a dumb thing and things don\u2019t start out too good for both of them.So far the shadow rider women have proven to be independent and strong female characters, and Sasha is no different. She is the soul provider for her family and she won\u2019t let anyone stop her from taking care of the ones she loves. She has her mind set on priorities and life, always finding a way to overcome any obstacle. But one thing I loved about Sasha was her standing up to Giovanni\u2019s mother, Sasha didn\u2019t let Ferraro mama look down on her or hurt her with her words, which surprised even Giovanni. I was proud of Sasha \ud83d\ude42 Sasha did have a difficult time believing that Giovanni cared for her, but in her defense, it was Giovanni\u2019s fault. And of course, she isn\u2019t shy about throwing a few punches. Sasha comes into Giovanni\u2019s life when he most needs her.Something that I liked about this book was all the minor/big details in the background, such as two couples that I can\u2019t wait to read more about. First, we have Emmanuelle and Valentino, whom we\u2019ve heard mentions of in the previous books, but this time it looks like whatever is going on between them, could harm them both. Then, we have Taviano and Nicoletta whose relationship seems rockier than the rest of the Ferraro siblings. And we\u2019re still waiting for the oldest Ferraro brother to start having children of his own.Shadow Keeper is the book among the series where I feel we have gotten more information on the family up until now. It shows us a different side of Giovanni and much he sacrifices for his family and his loved ones. It also gave us a great female character daring and brave. If you\u2019re a fan of Christine Feehan, I recommend this book and series. And I especially love this series because it takes place in Chicago!Memorable quotes:\u201cEnlighten us to what wisdom our parent passed on to you.\u201d -Stefano.\u201cI think that\u2019s called being kissed senseless.

The threat against Sasha was a complete mystery with twists and turns until the end. That made for a pulse-pumping read. I also liked that Sasha didn\u2019t spend most of the book fighting the strong attraction to Giovanni. Although he came across as domineering and controlling, he also listened to her and gave her space to be semi-independent. In real life, I would kick chauvinistic men like the Ferraros to the curb, but it makes for a scintillating read. Like most of her books, it has super-hot sex \u2013 and a lot of it.

I love this series, as the premise though paranormal, it is different and fantastic. Refresher: Shadow riders have the ability to blend themselves to the shadows wherever they are, making themselves invisible to anyone. They have been in existence for centuries, with all members of their families trained to use those abilities. The family runs a legitimate business; they use their ability to help others in need to solve various problems and dispense justice. They are an extremely powerful and close-knit family that is totally loyal to one another, also protecting the people that in live in their community.Giovanni Ferraro, our hero, has an injury to his leg, which keeps him from shadow riding. Instead, he hangs around the family owned nightclub, keeping up his appearance of being a playboy. He finds himself attracted to the new waitress, but when she overhears him and his cousins fooling around about betting on who gets a woman to seduce them, Giovanni notices her disdain and becomes belligerent; something is never does. What is it about this girl that has him enthralled?Sasha Provis, our heroine, works two jobs; during the day at the local deli, and at night at the nightclub. She needs money to take care of her older brother, who is in a rehab after a serious accident. Sasha is filling in for someone; she has to cover the upper tier, which consists of famous and rich men. When three of them go too far, try to rip her top, it is Giovanni who will come to her rescue. He takes her to the local pizza place to unwind, and apologize for his behavior. Giovanni knows that Sasha is the one for him, and he can sense that she can do shadows, though she is not experienced in that.A slow built romance begins, as Giovanni does everything to win Sasha\u2019s trust, and their romance is sizzling hot. He was a great hero, doing everything he can to help her financially with her brother. Sasha was a wonderful heroine, who loved her brother, though he does not remember her, and she does everything in her power to pay for everything herself, not wanting the Ferraro\u2019s to contribute to the expense.Shadow Keeper is also a mystery, as to who is trying to break up Giovanni and Sasha, and putting other lives in danger. This will also bring Sasha and Giovanni closer, as well as indoctrinating Sasha to the Ferraro family. This was lots of fun to watch her bond with the ladies, and begin to trust all of them.What follows is an exciting adventure, where both Sasha and Giovanni find themselves under attack, with the entire Ferraro family working hard to find the culprit. This was also a very sensual romance, as Feehan had a lot of sex scenes between our couple. The intense pulse pounding story did remain in the forefront, but I did feel that the sex scenes a bit too many.What I love the most about this series is all the wonderful characters that Feehan has created. I love all of the Ferraros, and those they fall in love with that join the family. They are an awesome family, with amazing abilities that make this so much fun.Shadow Keeper is a captivating, exciting, suspenseful, action packed story, with a wonderful couple that steams the pages. This is a fantastic paranormal series that you should be reading, and very well written by Christine Feehan.BarbThe Reading Cafe"}, {"userName": "Tina Christopher", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2396730-tina-christopher", "userReview": "Another great read from Christine Feehan, even if not quite as good as the previous two books in the series.

Strength, class, family, passion. You checked all the boxes for me. In my mind you even raised Giovanni's status . Okay people don't hate me, Giovanni apparently made an impression on a lot of people in book 1 and 2. This series continues to evolve, each book is about one of the brothers and family. As they leave their own brand of justice in the world it raises some thoughts on right, wrong, does the end justify the means, but that is all on the individual reader. The story itself is about family. Family in a big way. There is intrigue, mystery, a little red herring and of course Christine Feehans trademark of detailed sex. In fact this book starts out with it, so if your like me and don't require that to enjoy a plot, don't give up. The plot itself is fantastic. I like that fact this is the Shadow world. Shadows are good and bad, they can bring comfort or fear and I think The Ferraro family brings it all.

The men are in many ways so totally alpha that one might consider killing them, but at their heart, they are totally devoted to their women. This type of hero is catnip for some, including me. Giovanni Ferraro gets off to a bad start in his pursuit of Sasha Provis due to his alpha hotel behavior. Still, their connection is there. The heroine is strong but there were times I was like, \"WTH, woman?\" so I could understand Giovanni's reactions. There's a suspense plot and lots of on-going series threads. The suspense plot was a little...out there. There were some contrived moments that I just had to go with the flow with, and tying off the plot was a bit...anticlimatic.

Sasha was a good match for Giovanni - she wasn't a pushover, she was strong-minded, very stubborn, and they definitely suited each other sexually. For once, Giovanni actually had to put some effort into getting the attention he wanted, and Sasha was certainly wary of him at the start of the story, and for good reason.
