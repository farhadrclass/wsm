The blurb says it's set in Nazi-occupied Budapest, and while that era continues to haunt the protagonist and the city (not to mention the racism present in Hungary today), the vast majority of the book is set in the present and revolves around a set of journalists at an English language newspaper who are trying to report on a powerful rightwing upsurge in European Union politics. I will not make any further connections but if you have an interest in Europe this is a very interesting book that is not just fiction. (there's a bibliography at the back and I fact checked many of the things mentioned and they do unfortunately exist. LeBor was an investigative journalist.)There's a love interest back story that could have been worse than it was and although I don't think writing women is his strength, even so-called resilient, strong women who are active in the story, I'm willing to forgive him this flaw."}, {"userName": "Ian Brydon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28014642-ian-brydon", "userReview": "This was one of those serendipitous discoveries. I had never heard of this novel, or its author Adam LeBor, and came across it entirely by chance, spotting it in the middle of a list of recommendations thrown up by Amazon. Being a reckless sort of chap at heart I threw caution to the wind and stumped up the necessary 99 pence with scarcely a moment's hesitation, and found myself reaping heavy dividends.The encomia cited in the publisher's blurb compared it to le Carre at his finest. I am not sure that is really true. That is not a judgement on its quality but it operates in a wholly different milieu to le Carre. To my mind it was more like Charles Cumming or with shades of upper-end Alistair MacLean thrown in.Alex Farkas is a British journalist living in Budapest, where his family had originally come from, and working on an English language weekly newspaper. As the novel opens Budapest is the scene of the first stage of campaigning for elections for the European Presidency, and the two leading candidates are in Hungary to outline their respective manifestos. One of the candidates is an Austrian academic, known for his right wings views and in particular some injudicious comments about the numbers of immigrants seeking entry into the European Union, and dismissive remarks about the Gypsy and Roma communities located around the eastern fringes of the EU.While the candidates are pursuing their respective campaigns, the fragile coalition in Hungary teeters beyond sustainability, and a bloodless constitutional coup sees a new, far right government taking over. Meanwhile, Alex and his colleagues hear alarming stories about strange goings-on among Hungary's own Roma community.LeBor (himself a journalist) manages all the threads of the story adroitly, with fascinating insight into the workings of a foreign news agency. All in all, a very enjoyable and engaging read."}, {"userName": "Btetlow", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4930856-btetlow", "userReview": "A well written and engaging book. Biased maybe because I loved Budapest.A great and very realistic tale that is so relevant to the workings of todays world. A great reminder of our duties as citizens and that just because we have democracy doesn't mean we can sit back and trust everything will be OK.Journalists cum writers always have a unique perspective of world events, and Adam LeBor has captured the tale of a realistic alternative future."}, {"userName": "Chris Ioannou", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33475186-chris-ioannou", "userReview": "Although it took me a few tries to get in to this due to other commitments, as soon as I had the time to read this I struggled to put the damn book down!

The only thing worth is the accurate description of how Fascism has widespread in Central-East Europe post Communism and the corruption in those countries. Also the discrimination of Roma minorities is credible, but the EU as a Nazi creation is typical of the worst Brexiters propaganda. Germany has generate antibodies to nazi-fascism, that have contributed to the creation of the European Union."}, {"userName": "Andrew Brown", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21906246-andrew-brown", "userReview": "I think the idea of this story is devastating, especially if true!..however it doesn't really work as a fictional recounting of what might be real history.There are too many coincidences along the way to get the hero to the hotel...and coincidences are a weak story hook.The main problem I have though is that if this is real history, how are we ever going to be free again? I voted against us staying in the Common Market back in 1975 and to think now that it is the '4th Reich' makes me realize that those of us who voted 'No' in that Referendum were right.I've only given it 1 star because of the writing, but really this story is the most important of our times.. the giving up of our freedom to the unelected bureaucrats of a corrupt system dedicated over the last 70 years to getting rid of democracy and creating a very subtle system of slave labour based on the 'free movement of peoples' within the EU, which means a lowering of living standards in all the countries of the EU and only enriches the organization itself, hiding behind it's opaque glass walls; it's unaccountable officials enriching themselves with their enormous pensions and expense account living, like the Gauleiters of old.Adam Lebor should write the real history of this loathsome organisation."}, {"userName": "Tony Calder", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7348006-tony-calder", "userReview": "Adam LeBor has a keen interest in the financial side of the Third Reich - he has written some history books on the subject - and that interest is clearly on show in this novel. The novel is generally well-written, and the characters are believable. For the first two thirds of the book. The final third, however, is a different story. The plot starts to require more suspension of disbelief than I could give, and several of the characters start making decisions that are highly unlikely. And the final resolution is a pretty big deus ex machina. The appendices provided are quite interesting."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10948030-mark", "userReview": "Part Dan Brown style thriller, part financial history of the Third Reich, The Budapest Protocol fell between the cracks of both.
