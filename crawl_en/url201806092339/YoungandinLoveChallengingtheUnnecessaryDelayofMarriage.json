Amen! When I saw that Young and In Love was coming out I thought to myself \u201cFinally!\u201d Soon to celebrate my 18th wedding anniversary to my childhood sweetie, I was wishing that we would have had this book back then. The book is geared toward couples who are young and in love.. not for the singles, not for someone older who is waiting, not for those who believe in waiting for their career and all their plans to get their lives in order before getting married. Our culture has created this wide gap in between childhood and adulthood called adolescence and that stage of life is getting larger and larger, now saying that kids aren\u2019t maturing until age 25! Ted Cunningham has couples test their maturity level earlier, look critically at their partner and theirselves to determine if they are indeed ready for marriage despite what the worldly view tends to hold. He has them look at marriage as a privilege, a blessing, a permanent bond. Couples test their chemistry, compentency and character to analyze whether God has put them together as a couple. Without Christ the early marriages wouldn\u2019t work out, but then neither do the marriages that wait until they are \u2018mature\u2019. Ted uses key scripture in Song of Solomon, Ecclesiastes and more to showcase God\u2019s plan for marriage. Well written, interactive guide book for all young couples considering marriage at a young age. A trailblazer book that I pray starts a new revolution for young marriages!!"}, {"userName": "Kate Scott", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3231141-kate-scott", "userReview": "A few weeks before I received an email pitch for Young and in Love from B&B Media, I learned that an old acquaintance of mine from grade school had ended up getting married to her high school sweetheart when she was barely eighteen. I mentioned it to a few family members and friends, curious as to what they would think. Young and old, they all had pretty much the same response: raised eyebrows, open mouths, and an implied, \u201cWhat was she thinking?!\u201d I, on the other hand, thought, \u201cWhat\u2019s the big deal? She\u2019s been dating this guy for years, they graduated, figured out how to support themselves, and then got married. I probably wouldn\u2019t have done the same thing if I were in her shoes, but there\u2019s nothing inherently brainless about getting married that young.\u201d The timing of the email was perfect, and I jumped at the chance to read Cunningham\u2019s thoughts on this hot topic.Continue reading this review here: http://parchmentgirl.com/book-reviews..."}, {"userName": "Laurie Carlson", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4898049-laurie-carlson", "userReview": "\u201cYoung and In Love\u201d by Ted CunninghamFinally! A book that is about something that has always weighed heavily on my heart! Marrying young, as God has intended!This is a book about young people who have met, fallen in love, and want to get married. They do not want to delay their marriage just because they are young. They want to get married since they have both found that special person they know is right for them as a couple to marry, and are ready to spend the rest of their lives together, growing together as you do in marriage. They have been blessed by God in finding each other, and want to follow His rules about being together.The Author, Ted Cunningham, happens to be a Pastor in a church he founded called Woodland Hills Family Church located in Branson Missouri. He wrote this book based upon his own life, beliefs, and what he practices in his church. He has a wonderful set of guidelines young people should consider and follow \u2018before\u2019 they get married, which I think is wonderful! (\u2018Anyone\u2019 at \u2018any\u2019 age should consider and follow these guidelines, in my opinion, as this book applies to all people who decide to marry at any age, really.) This book\u2019s message encourages marriage at a young age and gives terrific advice that should be followed by these young people who are considering and/or are going to marry.This author/Pastor is for marrying at a young age if you have found the person you love and are mature and responsible. He feels you should not wait, but to follow God\u2019s plan he has for us, because finding the one we love is a gift from God. We should take this gift from God and not risk losing it..Before I even heard about this book, I have always had of the belief that Society, today, is just \u2018not\u2019 conducive to young people getting married, and this is the way the author feels. I have always felt God has marriage in mind for us at an early age because he has given us all these natural feelings we have at an early age, otherwise, they would not be there. These feelings are there and with us for a reason, which when you read this book, you will understand this even more so. I don\u2019t want to give everything away in this review as this should be read by many people in hopes that supporting our young people getting married will become accepted more so than what it is currently. This author/Pastor has a great message to share about the benefits of marrying young. He does point out there are \u2018foxes\u2019 to watch out for, and they are not foxes in the terms of beautiful people. This you\u2019ll have to read about as well. This advice he gives is incredible.Teens and young adults are, in today\u2019s Society, are made to wait and go through all this resistance from people, from the church, from society, from school (generally college) for their choice to marry and not give in to their feelings, as the Bible teaches us. It seems practically a set-up for failure to not marry young. You must follow Gods\u2019 ways, and waiting to marry could potentially cause you to lose the gift God has given you; the one you love. Accept it. Don\u2019t allow parents, the church, school, or other people and more hold you back. If you feel you are ready, responsible and mature enough for marriage, then get married. He continues on with saying waiting to get married for what? For us to become to set in our ways, to become almost selfishly to absorbed in our own ways and not honestly share our love with another person? He also says that today, with all this waiting until we have reached this milestone or that milestone in life, has turned us into a sinful world by putting marriage off, and almost last. We are ending up living together and/or having sex before marriage, all going against the Word of God, and I happen to agree.The great thing this author/Pastor has is a guideline of rules/considerations that \u2018should\u2019 be followed for a healthy and successful marriage, (and actually, this can be applied to anyone at any age for marriage and even \u2018during\u2019 our current marriage.)I have felt God has made us so we can marry young, have children at a fairly young age, and to \u2018grow together through marriage\u2019, and this is exactly what this book\u2019s message is about. This book covers all this and a lot more. It discusses a variety of the many different views on young marriage, the church\u2019s views on young marriage, and this Pastor\u2019s own views on young marriage, which are positive and many. He discusses age, privilege, and responsibility. Not just anyone can jump into marriage, as you have to be mature enough to take this huge responsibility. Even marrying at an older age does \u2018not\u2019 guarantee that it will work if you don\u2019t have what this Pastor discusses you \u2018need\u2019 to have in order to make your marriage a success.I think this is an excellent book for ALL young people and their parents to read together. Married people can benefit from this book as well. I believe this author wrote the perfect book to help end a lot of problems young people face by \u2018not\u2019 marrying young. There is so much more great information in this book, it really should be a must read for all parents and young people, even by society so they can start to understand the benefits of young marriage.I am \u2018very\u2019 glad I got the opportunity to review this book with feeling the way I do about people getting married at a younger age and \u2018staying\u2019 married. When I saw this book was available for review, I HAD to jump at it to review it, as I felt it most likely supported my opinions of marrying young, and it does.Sure enough, this book is not a disappointment at all, but an encouragement to many young people out there who \u2018do\u2019 want to marry and happen to be young.*I received this book for \u201cFREE\u201d from The B & B Media Group, Inc., through David Cook Publishers, through their Book Reviewer\u2019s Program in exchange to read this book and write a review about it.

My husband and I were high school sweethearts, but didn\u2019t marry until he finished college (I had one semester left after we got married). And it was for the very reason that we \u201cneeded\u201d to get college out of the way first. We \u201cneeded\u201d to get ourselves ready for life before we were \u201cready\u201d for marriage. At the time we got married, we had been dating for over FIVE years. Yes, FIVE. And, no, unfortunately, we were unable to remain sexually pure. We tried \u2013 and made it until we were engaged. At that point, the \u201cjustification\u201d was that we were almost married, and we knew marriage was just around the corner. Still, it was wrong. If we had married even younger, we would have made it. It\u2019s really the only regret I have in regards to our marriage.Anyway \u2026 back to the book. I loved it. It\u2019s a quick, easy read \u2013 but overflowing with excellent information and advice. And I just love Pastor Ted Cunningham! His voice is excellent, and his stance on dating is awesome. You see, I grew up in a church that was very anti-dating. VERY. It was horrible, and rooted in fear, as I believe their reasoning was that by NOT dating, we were removing ourselves from the temptation to have sex before marriage. Neveramind how hard it is to actually find your spouse if you\u2019re unwilling to date! Cunningham says that dating is an important part of falling in love, and even calls it a possible budding marriage. I wish someone had said the following while we were growing up:Be on guard against any ministry that deters twentysomethings from dating. When you\u2019re single and surrounded by hundreds of other singles, that\u2019s the perfect time to find someone and get married. ~ pages 73-74The church I grew up in was against dating in general \u2013 ALL dating. From teenagers (which, frankly, should be the parents\u2019 decision) and college students, to those well into their adulthood. There were many in the church who wanted to get married, but refused to date. How anyone expected to get married, I have NO IDEA. As Pastor Cunningham says,Sitting at home waiting for a \u201cmatch\u201d or for your phone to ring is like expecting a call from a company that never received your resume. ~ page 113Now, the context of that quote actually is talking about using online dating/matchmaking services. But, I think it applies here, too.Anyway, not only does Cunningham encourage people to date, but he gives young couples information to help them discover if marriage is right for them. Things to ascertain whether you\u2019re with someone you should be marrying, someone who is a responsible adult. And he tackles the idea of adolescence, saying basically it\u2019s extended childhood.I loved everything Cunningham says, and his voice is one I find myself wanting to read more of. I half jokingly told my husband I wanted to move to Branson, Missouri, so we could attend Cunningham\u2019s church! LOLI would HIGHLY recommend this book to anyone who is young and in love (surprise!), especially if they have people telling them they\u2019re just not ready. And, really, their parents and naysayers should also read it. This has helped me think about how I will approach that time in my children\u2019s lives \u2013 the time when they are young and in love."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2521894-laura", "userReview": "Title: YOUNG AND IN LOVEAuthor: Ted CumminghamPublisher: David C. CookJuly 2011ISBN: 978-0-7814-0447-1Genre: Inspirational/dating and relationshipsMaybe \u201cI do\u201d is better than \u201cJust don\u2019t.\u201dPastor Ted Cunningham was taught as many of us where. Sex is dirty. Don\u2019t do it. Save it for the one you love. But it didn\u2019t work\u2014most singles had sex outside of marriage. And now, cohabitating and unmarried sex is even more common, even expected among singles. In a rebuttal against \u201cI Kissed Dating Goodbye\u201d (embracing courtship) Cunningham says, \u201cKiss it hello. Date!\u201d If a girl is dating another man, ask her out anyway. Dating isn\u2019t the same as marriage. And if your parents/friends/pastor say \u201cYou just think you\u2019re in love or you\u2019re too young to get married\u201d then marry anyway. Marriage is the answer to staying sexually pure. A godly relationship is hard when you fall in love at a young age. Few offer support. Many doubt. And they claim \u201cYou\u2019re not ready.\u201d Cunningham says \u201cWait no more. Get Married!\u201d YOUNG AND IN LOVE packs a punch with a lot of humor and wit. This was a great read, and it validates young love, giving the couple in the relationship the tools to make a wise commitment and challenging them not to delay what God is knitting together. I\u2019m not sure how I feel about this book. If I had read this book as a nineteen year old in love with the one I thought was Mr. Right, I would have been all for it. Yahoo! Someone\u2019s on my side! I did marry at twenty-two, but a different man than I dated at nineteen. And as a mature adult with twenty-five years of marriage under my belt, I wonder\u2014would I still be married if I\u2019d married when I was nineteen? His parents broke us up\u2014he was too young. I seriously doubt I would have been able to handle his family\u2014or that man\u2014long enough for a lasting marriage. Now, as a parent myself, I have an eighteen year old and a twenty year old. Neither one of them is talking marriage\u2014yet. Both have plans they are striving toward, college degrees to earn, etc. But well\u2014can I see my eighteen year old getting married to his current girlfriend? Seriously, I don\u2019t even want to consider it. When it is eventually discussed, I hope I don\u2019t try to break them up, I hope that I don\u2019t say \u201cyou\u2019re too young.\u201d But\u2026 Well, that is all I have to say about that. YOUNG AND IN LOVE is a great book validating marriage--and not an eternal childhood. And it's supported by scripture. Seriously, a great book. But I think you need to exercise caution. Is he/she really someone you want to spend the rest of your life with? Does he/she get along well with your family? Am I really in love, or am I just in lust?

Be warned: this was written for a fairly narrow audience, of which I am likely not a predicted member, being already married and of the author's generation. The sections on evaluating a potential spouse and preparing to stick with them were helpful. I also liked that he spoke logically and plainly about finances.However, his tone and methods are less than winning, for those who may be skeptical. It's as if we should agree with him because he says things over and over and, by the way, because he's a pastor and has some experience. I'm sure he worked hard on this book, and his message comes from his heart. But when he quotes statistics he doesn't agree with, he should give some evidence to support his view. In addition, the scriptural exegesis seems sloppy at times. While useful in some areas, more teaching Is needed to prepare for marriage. I would not recommend this apart from balancing works on the meaning of marriage and discerning and managing one's emotions."}, {"userName": "Grant Murdock", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57019389-grant-murdock", "userReview": "My wife and I read this book as we considered marriage not long after we were out of high school.
