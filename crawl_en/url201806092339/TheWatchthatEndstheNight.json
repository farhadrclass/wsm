George grew up with Catherine and always loved her, but never had the chance to marry her before Jerome did. Catherine's heart was damaged during a bout of rheumatic fever and so her time on Earth is more limited, but she does not let that limit her life. Jerome, a brilliant surgeon with an intense, energetic personality, goes to Spain during the Spanish Civil War and is presumed captured, tortured and dead, so after a while Catherine marries George. Except one day, Jerome comes back... and that's where our story opens. What effect will Jerome's return have on George and especially Catherine?MacLennan writes beautifully in this book, and George's narration really touches your heart. Sometimes it is difficult to imagine how he would have been able to reconstruct some of the conversations, especially ones where he was not present, but it's easy enough to suspend disbelief. George's grief over Catherine's illness is all too real; MacLennan wrote this while his first wife was dying, and George's pain was likely to a great extent his own. But it's not all sad. Catherine herself refuses to let her condition bring her down, filling her days with creating joyful paintings, getting together with friends, and just enjoying life. There are amusing asides, too, especially about George's fellow teachers at Waterloo School (apparently based in part on MacLennan's experiences teaching at Lower Canada College). And the city of Montreal is very wonderfully described -- after reading this I have a hankering to go back."}, {"userName": "Shirley Schwartz", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4278399-shirley-schwartz", "userReview": "This novel is so many things. It's a tremendous love story, It's a story about a Canadian city (Montreal) as it was in the 1930's and 1940's. It's a story of loss, betrayal and abandonment. It's a story about the internal strength and resliency of the human spirit. It is also a story of Canada written by an author who truly loved this country of ours. The story is tragic and hopeful at the same time. It left me with a feeling of loss at the end when the narrative of the three main characters comes to its ineveitable end. Jerome, Catherine and George will reamin with me for a time, as so often happens with wonderful books written by a master as Hugh MacLennan was. Not quite the book that Two Solitudes is, but I'm glad that I took the time to read it. Hugh's love and understanding of Canada and the people who live here was quite remarkable, and reading one of his books makes me prouder than ever to be a Canadian."}, {"userName": "Travis West", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16765606-travis-west", "userReview": "Sad and beautiful and honest, one of the best books I've ever read. that's all I have to say about it."}, {"userName": "Eden Church | The Required Reading List", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28315345-eden-church-the-required-reading-list", "userReview": "What is CanLit?

You truly get a sense of the character's motivations and needs throughout the whole book, and while there are some stilted dialogue sequences and a handful of obscure references, the material is just too good to put down.Definitely a book not to be missed."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1884982-adam", "userReview": "Wonderful evocations of that great enchantress Montreal provide the backdrop to a beautifully rendered set of characters, and a warmly and compassionately told story. Hugh MacLennan is undoubtedly one of the great Canadian prose artists, and probably one of the best at evoking a sense of place. What he does with Montreal here is comparable to what Leonard Cohen accomplished in his debut novel (albeit with a different side of Montreal) and what Robert Kroetsch has done with various places in Alberta. The New York Times blurb on the back of my edition gets it exactly right: \"It is cause for rejoicing when as truly distinguished a novel as The Watch That Ends the Night appears... Mr. MacLennan makes his readers feel a little different, perhaps even a little wiser, because they have shared in his pages some part of life that they have never shared or understood before.\""}, {"userName": "Jon Leam", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20136619-jon-leam", "userReview": "What did I think about the book? I liked it a lot. Not necessarily an easy read.The book was first published in 1958, and is set in Canada in the 30s and 40s.Part of the reason I started reading the book was simply due to a musical reference -- some of the lyrics to The Tragically Hip song \"Courage\" came from this passage in the book: \"...there is no simple explanation for anything important any of us do, and that the human tragedy, or the human irony, consists in the necessity of living with the consequences of actions performed under the pressure of compulsions so obscure we do not and cannot understand them.\" That quote came to have an incredible amount of weight in my mind, and explains my view on the subjectivity of much human experience."}, {"userName": "Leslie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3047454-leslie", "userReview": "It's perhaps surprising that I had never read this book before; it's a classic of mid-century Canadian fiction, written before the upsurge in Canadian literature in the decades after it. It is a book very much of its time, trying to be the Great Canadian Novel in the way that American writers of the same period were trying to be the Great American Novel, self-consciously engaging with Big Ideas about being Canadian and being modern and being a man and so on. It is very much a book of its time, with all the limitations and annoying assumptions and pretensions that implies--but also with all the ambition and hunger to say Something Important.

Truly this man was an artist. \u201cGo to the musicians. In the work of a few musicians you can hear every aspect of this conflict between light and dark within the soul. You can hear all the contradictory fears, hopes, desires and passions of Everyman fissioning and fusing into new harmonies out of the dead ones. You can hear - you can almost see - the inward process of destruction, creation , destruction again and recreation into the last possible harmony, the only one there can be, which is a will to live, love, grow and be grateful, the determination to endure all things, suffer all things, hope all things, believe all things necessary for what our ancestors called the glory of God....... The musicians can show this happen; oddly enough, they can show it specifically. One musical idea uttered in the minor in a certain tempo is surrender, despair and suicide. The same idea restated in the major with horns and woods becomes an exultant call to life. This, which is darkness, also is light. This, which is no, also is yes. This, which is hatred, also is love. This, which is fear, also is courage. This, which is defeat, also is victory. Who knows the things of the spirit except the spirit of man which is within him? said St. Paul.So the final justification of the human plight - the final vindication of God himself, for that matter - is revealed in a mystery of feelings which understand, in an instant of revelation, that it is of no importance that God appears indifferent to justice as men understand it. He gave life. He gave it. Life for a year, a month, a day or an hour is still a gift. The warmth of the sun or the caress of the air, the sight of a flower or a cloud on the wind, the possibility even for one day more to see things grow - the human bondage is also the human liberty. Where wast thou when I laid the foundation of the earth? Declare, if thou has understanding.So, for an instant, you may have that understanding.To have it, to feel the movement of light flood the darkness of the self - even for an instant - is the most beautiful experience anyone can ever know. And millions have known it. ...Meanwhile darkness and inner chaos.\""}, {"userName": "Mike", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35759060-mike", "userReview": "Hugh MacLennan, one of the only Nova Scotian authors to gain widespread recognition writes what seems deeply imbued with personal experience. This is an ambitious tale spanning time and geography, the first half of the 20th century between Halifax, Montreal and the Capitol. It was delightful to read such evocative passages of these familiar streets but I believe I may be biased in that. Much of, The Watch the Ends the Night, is quite dry, but it contains the most Canadian thing I've ever read, a canoe chase through the woods of northern Quebec. It could have been a silly SCTV sketch but it is completely earnest, harrowing, exciting and quite sweet.The reason for picking this up was my melodramatic compulsion to read the book that inspired the lyrics to the Tragically Hip song, Courage. It's right there almost word for word \"...there is no simple explanation for anything important of us do, and that the human tragedy, or the human irony, consists in the necessity of living with the consequences of actions performed under pressure of compulsions so obscure we do not and cannot understand them. Morality? Duty?...\" The book is peppered with these very dense and thoughtful moments that make one has to take a pause for thought. And it's worth reading for these, even if it drags in parts.It is that sort of writing, very much of it's time, questioning traditional ideas of masculinity and femininity so that it is like time travelling to the hang ups of my grandparents' era. There are whispers of underground communist sympathisers defecting to join the Spanish Civil War, Jewish intellectuals, and secret meetings. The whole thing is very rich with context, enlightening for a non-history-buff.It was let down for me by the whole test-of-faith element which is very central, but again it was written in the 50's. Still, a bit preachy in parts.With a heart fully on display, MacLennan takes a huge swing at big philosophical questions in complicated and interesting times. I think he landed pretty respectable base hit. If nothing else, read it for the canoes!"}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7172184-diane", "userReview": "This is the final book I needed to read to complete my 2017 Bingo Reading Challenge \"Card\" for CanadianContent's 2017 Bingo reading challenge! The square called for a book published in the year you were born (or decade if you couldn't find something). George Stewart is married to Catherine, the love of his life whose health is precarious due to a heart condition. But she was married to a man before him, a man who became his best friend, Dr. Jerome Martell. Jerome went missing in WWII, presumed dead in a POW camp. But Jerome has returned to Montreal and the apple cart is upset.The story then retreats into the pasts of all three characters to bring t heir stories from the 1930s right up to the early 1950s when the story began. George became a third wheel in the relationship between Catherine and Jerome and was a good family friend to them both up to when Jerome left Montreal to take his medical skills to the Spanish Civil War. Montreal in the 1930s was crackling with politics, with the Spanish war between the Fascists and Communists firing imaginations worldwide. George then has to deal with the huge impact that Jerome's return has caused. I did find that the narrative got dragged down by too much philosophy near the end. I don't think it really added to the story much, just gave the author a chance to express his own views on the world and the individual.It's the story of relationships, friendship, politics, families, love, survival and loyalties. The characters are interesting and the dynamics between them are written very realistically.

Set mostly in Montreal, it's the story of George Stewart, his wife Catherine and her first husband Jerome Martell. Jerome Martell is a brilliant surgeon who leaves his wife and child in 1938 to go to Spain and provide medical care to the loyalist side in the Spanish Civil War. Years pass, he is presumed dead, and there are reports that he was killed by the Nazis after leaving Spain for France. George, who has loved Catherine since age 17, marries her. But, at the beginning of the book (in 1953), it's revealed that Jerome Martell is not dead, and that he has returned to Montreal. Most of the book is George's memories and reflections on his life and what he knows of Jerome's difficult, driven life. The backdrop of the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s is compelling as this was a time of great change in Canada. This book, however, transcends borders as it is really about the true nature of love and belief, and the very human struggle to find meaning (if there is any) in our own small lives. Fans of the Tragically Hip will know the song \"Courage (for Hugh MacLennan)\"; this song contains some lines from \"The Watch that Ends the Night\". Here's the entire passage from the book: \"But that night as I drove back to Montreal I at least discovered this: that there is no simple explanation for anything important any of us do, and that the human tragedy, or the human irony, consists in the necessity of living with the consequences of actions performed under the pressure of compulsions so obscure we do not and cannot understand them\"."}, {"userName": "Denise", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6065717-denise", "userReview": "As the spectre of an early death looms over Catherine's life and therefore the man that loves her, so does the threat of fascism threaten the lives of Canada in the 1930's and threat of an atom bomb in the 1950's.

In a strange way, it seems the more we change, the more we stay the same as people. While I am not entirely sure how I feel about the narrator of the book, I realize that I can like the book without entirely liking the narrator. This book is a collection of love stories set against the backdrop of history, but they are the love stories of intense and flawed people. So the stories are somewhat unconventional, because it is not just love for other people, but also for ideals, and sometimes those things get confused. At the same time, we see the changing world through the eyes of the narrator, who is a political commentator for the CBC. So at the same time that we get observations like the one above, we also get insights like this:\"The evil inside the human animal -- the fascists are charming it out like a cobra out of its hole and the capitalists let them do it because they think it's good for business.\"I feel like this is as true today as it ever was, though perhaps it is not the fascists, exactly. But that evil gets charmed out, and some people think it is good for business.

It's so much more than that, though: this novel is an introspective look at the human condition, and of a society that seeks to leave behind the horrors of the Second World War and enter a newer, more modern world.I read this (and discovered MacLennan as a writer) entirely because of Gord Downie paying homage to him in a song. I mention this not to be self-effacing, but because the material that he drew from is essential to understanding the themes of the book: \u201cI at least discovered this: that there is no simple explanation for anything important any of us do, and that the human tragedy, or the human irony, consists in the necessity of living with the consequences of actions performed under the pressure of compulsions so obscure we do not and cannot understand them.\u201dThe Watch That Ends the Night is a breathtakingly beautiful meditation on the process of aging, the ways that our life experiences shape the person we become, and the ways that our understanding of romantic love are impacted by those things."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20781076-jonathan", "userReview": "I don't know if this is a great book.

Not that confirmation of one's worldview is the point of literature, at all, but it sure helps me feel less alone.Some people seem to feel that the female characters here are less complex than the male characters, or less believable. As a man, I am perhaps less equipped than some to judge. But they sure felt like complex, believable individuals to me. I didn't think there were many stereotypes at play in general.Some have compared this to 'The End of the Affair'. Both involve somewhat similar themes; but this book is composed of a bunch of decent people making terrible decisions, while that one is composed of a bunch of horrible people acting surprisingly decently.

The narrator, George Stewart, is middle aged, mildly successful; a devoted step-father contentedly married to the love of his life in 1950\u2019s Montreal. However, because of a variety of factors, including his upbringing by loving but ineffectual parents, his youth spent during the Depression, and his wife Catherine\u2019s illness, George has never felt secure.
