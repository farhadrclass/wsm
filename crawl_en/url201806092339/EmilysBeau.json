Probably not for anyone that isn't interested in multiple misunderstandings and personal angst etc, but I really enjoyed the fact that (for a change) there were no 'bad guys' no 'action' no chases etc. This was all about the people and the relationships. There were lots of minor characters, but they stayed in the background as wallpaper.Lots of romantic tension but only a small amount of actual steam hinted at. That said, this book was so interesting, it didn't need it. I felt like I was in regency England.PS - There WAS a 'bad girl' and she was REALLY dreadful - I commend the author, as I really hated her."}, {"userName": "Katia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14035670-katia", "userReview": "nice novelbut only thatat first I loved that Em is so sure of Jacob and was so sorry to see her disappointment I loved that she kept making excuses for him at first and kept expecting him to declare his love fer her till Harriet interferedbut I really hated when Em agreed to marry Charles , and their kiss scene was just horribleEm became this practical seducing woman instead of the romantic witty girl but the ending was nice and I loved the twist when Harriet turned out to be Jacob's sister"}, {"userName": "Carrie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3410022-carrie", "userReview": "[I saw that twist on her parentage about a mile away, but it was worth it for her reaction.
