She had readers swoony over a certain Noble Groom (and a kiss to go with it!) and has taken readers back to many a fascinating era in history. In 2015, Jody took on an unfamiliar genre: Young Adult. Though the novel is still set in historical times, this book is certainly a step back from her usual normal and yet it rises, and in many instances surpasses the expectations readers will have had for the book. The story itself is like a Cinderella-esque fairytale with its own vision of the story. There\u2019s a deadline approaching that unless altered will forever change Rosemarie\u2019s future, and though there is no glass slipper or pumpkin carriage, there is plenty of romance and intrigue as well as a \u201cPrince Charming.\u201d Or as is the case here, three potential heroes \u2013 and what dashing young men they are! Each of the heroes is special in their own right.Jody began this saga in her novella The Vow, which I would encourage you to read prior to picking up An Uncertain Choice. It offers some insight and background into Rosemarie\u2019s life and the heartbreak she endures four years later during the events of this novel. Normally I am not any fan of love triangles, which this novel does have a propensity towards, however thanks to its wholesome, innocent heroine, this isn\u2019t the traditional kind of love triangle. Many love triangles introduce us to a wishy-washy heroine who flip-flops between the men vying for her attentions; this novel doesn\u2019t put Rosemarie in that situation. Rosemarie\u2019s emotions are more about realizing what the meaning of love is \u2013 what you\u2019re meant to feel, how you know what true love is \u2013 versus being undecided about the men she\u2019s faced with. She lived a sheltered life and as a result of the vow, her entire eighteen year life span was in preparation to live a life of solitude. A knowledge she had from the age of fourteen. Don\u2019t misunderstand, Rosemarie isn\u2019t some wilting flower, but she is a young woman coming of age in an era when chivalry and romance was at its best.I have to confess, medieval stories are a hard sell in my reading habits. But having known Jody Hedlund\u2019s previous books, I had little doubt this novel was going to live up to the hype. The first person (we switch off between two perspectives though mainly stay with Rosemarie) prose is beautifully and simplistically perfect. I loved that the details of the time period didn\u2019t overwhelm the fictional story, yet there is still enough to satisfy avid historians. Rosemarie\u2019s courtship is the primary of this novel along with the danger which threatens her happy ending. Balancing the historical aspects with these characters seems to be an asset to the books likability. Some novels get lost in the history, which is all well and good, but when one is reading a fictional tale, I expect more than a textbook read. The book is both interesting with its details and doesn\u2019t shirk on its promise of being an adventurous medieval adventure.Aside from the atmosphere and breath-catching sword fights, this is a perfect easy read for anyone wanting a period read. It sets up what I am sure will be a rewarding series and of course ends with a new threat that might throw Rosemarie into more danger or at the very least mean she\u2019ll have to rise to the occasion of becoming an even better ruler. I love Rosemarie as a heroine. She\u2019s kind (she\u2019s vehemently opposed to torture as means of punishment) and yet desires to become the ruler that her parent\u2019s would be proud of. Given what we learn of Rosemarie and her moral upbringing, she\u2019s well on her way to doing just that.I can honestly say, this is easily one of my favorite YA reads. It officially releases March 3rd, so be sure to add it to your to-be-read.This review originally appeared on Silver Petticoat Review.Sincere thanks to the author and publisher (NetGalley) for a complimentary review copy of this novel."}, {"userName": "Alyssa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1586516-alyssa", "userReview": "Wow! That was fantastic!! An Uncertain Choice by Jody Hedlund is a Young Adult Medieval fiction. It is Jody's first foray into Young Adult fiction, as she normally writes Adult Historical fiction. (I highly recommend all of Jody's other novels.) An Uncertain Choice was the perfect Historical YA read. It had everything I was hoping for: Knights, Princesses, sword fights, and swoon-worthy romance. Everybody should read this book. It's the perfect book for Historical fiction fans of ALL ages. Suffice to say I am excited beyond words for Jody's next book which releases October 2015!"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17957823-erin", "userReview": "I have long been a fan of Jody Hedlund's Christian historical romances and was interested in her YA ventures. An Uncertain Choice reminded me of my mother's Kathleen E Woodiwiss books, but much purer. You know the type, where the mere sight of the heroine's love interest sets her \"cheeks aflame and her insides quiver\" Something that I giggle at, but also deliciously enjoy. In this medieval romance, Lady Rosemarie must choose between three handsome knights vying for her affections or commit herself to the convent. But with the sheriff causing problems and her people stricken by a strange illness, will Lady Rosemarie be able to break an ancient oath before her eighteenth birthday? Okay, it's all a bit sugary sweet but I couldn't help but like the book. The chapters are short and it was nice to just read a nice clean story. The only quibble I had was the p.o.v changed many times even within chapters and sometimes it took me a moment to sort out who was talking. All in all, a great tale that I would recommend to the young and young at heart."}, {"userName": "Jaye Knight", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22751054-jaye-knight", "userReview": "I was a little leery starting An Uncertain Choice. I\u2019d seen several not so great reviews before I started it, so I went in with rather low expectations. I think that might be one reason I enjoyed it. I almost always find myself surprised when I go in with low expectations whether it be books or movies. While the book may have been predictable in areas and perhaps a little silly and unrealistic at times, I liked it quite a bit. I enjoyed the characters, particularly Derrick and the duke. I just loved their nobility. I even liked Rosemarie, which is quite a surprise knowing my usual dislike for female protagonists. Yes, her naivet\u00e9 and indecisiveness was a bit frustrating at times, she still grew on me. Aside from a few darker moments involving torture and such, this was a light, very fairytale-ish read, especially in the romance department. And who says fairy tale stories can\u2019t be a little silly and unrealistic? Once in a while, you just need fun stories like that to unwind and relax. There was definitely adventure to it as well. I devoured the last quarter of the book, almost skimming because I was so anxious to see what would happen (even if I could predict the ending). So if you\u2019re looking for a (mostly) light and fun fairytale princess-like story, then I recommend checking it out.I received a copy of this book free from BookLook Bloggers in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Melody", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43413-melody", "userReview": "Thank you to net galley and Zonderkidz-Books for providing a digital ARC of this novel in exchange for my honest opinion.Everything in this novel is very blunt and surface level. There is no opportunity for discovery, because characters reveal exactly what is on their mind, their motivations, ect. This is not a world that feels thought out to me, or particularly real. I'm fine with it being not necessarily historically accurate. But I don't really get a sense of the larger world in this. Even when talking about the people who the book claims Rosemarie loves so much. What is life like here? What does it look like? Feel like? The poor villagers function more as bad props, and a way to make Rosemarie look better. Which is kind of insulting.Additionally, the world just doesn't seem believable, by any rules established or created. This girl has been living basically on her own since her parents died? And she was given any even pretend semblance of power? In the middle ages? She hasn't been fully taken into the convent she was meant to join? Or shipped off to other family? There was absolutely no explanation about any of this given. Rosemarie mentioned her parents were dead, and we were expected to move on from there. I don't buy it. I wanted to read this novel because of the historical setting, and it's just not what I was hoping.These are not necessarily three dimensional characters. I get no sense of emotional investment from them.Because I felt no connection to the characters, the romance was lackluster. And the competition aspect of it always felt like a thrown reality show. At times I felt like I was reading about the medieval Bachelorette. Watch as contestant number 1 plans an elaborate dinner and a show. The romance has the potential to be a good, subtle slow burn. But again, everything always feels surface level. The stakes are laid out, but I'm not sure why I should care for them. They often don't feel deeply invested in their own journey. A lot of my personal objections to the novel come down to stylistically it wasn't engaging for me. The blunt prose didn't work. The shift between POV seems unnecessary. This, of course, like almost everything, is a matter of taste."}, {"userName": "Kathy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1143268-kathy", "userReview": "Loved this beautiful, gentle romance.

Unfortunately, I still found this book seriously disappointing and almost boring enough to give up on half way through.Our protagonist, Lady Rosemarie, is bound by a vow made by her parents to join a convent by her 18th birthday. BUT - there is an escape clause, provided she finds True Love and gets married first. We are, of course, supposed to ignore how utterly unimportant love was in marriages in the middle ages. She gets to spend a month being wooed by three highly eligible knights, because of course she does. There was nothing about this book that was unexpected - clearly she is going to fall for the brave but stoic knight who pays her the least attention (she is, of course, beautiful and kind and totally amazing, and the other two have plenty of things to compliment her on). The villain is the least poorly disguised villain outside of superhero movies, which is frustrating since we're supposed to be like Rosemarie and not know who it is until the last moment. Really, how does she not pick up on this?Anything unexpected that actually did happen felt like an out of place manufactured plot point. The main character trait of Rosemarie, that she is VERY CONCERNED about the well being of her subjects, especially the poor ones, was overplayed so much that it made her almost unlikable. The entire premise, dialog, and actions seemed so out of place from the time period in which it was set that it's hard to properly envision anything.The saving grace was that it was a quick, light read, making it easy to finish."}, {"userName": "Haley S", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30268420-haley-s", "userReview": "Oh, wow, this book is just so amazing. And, no, this isn't the first time I have read this book. I have read this book at least...hmm...three times, maybe more.Anyway, I love this book. An Uncertain Choice was my first Jody Hedlund book, and it got me hooked. To be honest, I haven't read all of Hedlund's books yet, but I am working on it! So, the whole 'game' between the three knights at Rosemarie left me hanging on the edge of my seat. It was kind of obvious of who she would fall in love with, but that didn't stop me from reading on to make sure my hypothesis was correct. So, I read on...and on...and on. I may not be correct on saying this, but I believe that I finished this book in one night. Yeah, I was excited and intrigued! mean, the first scene is a man being boiled to death. NO! Don't runaway from me now!!! It isn't as creepy as it sounds. There are no details. Believe me, if there were details, I would have dropped the book and ran.

However, after some thought, I would have loved to know more about each suitor; the wonderful Duke who cared so much for her, back stories, etc... The book is small and could have given us more.

I felt that there wasn't enough depth to the characters, and the romance between Lady Rosemarie and her love interest felt rushed and didn't seem very genuine. However I loved how in the end, Rosemarie discovers that she's a lot braver than she gives herself credit for, and I'm glad that things work out for her.One thing that bothers me however, is the fact that this novel was written in such a juvenile manner. I mean, I've ready one other book by Jody Hedlund that was adult fiction, and it was written perfectly fine. Just because the book is ya, why does that mean the writing quality has to be so unsatisfying?

If you want to read this book without knowing the ending, don\u2019t read this.So, I was going to wait until I was in a better mood to do this review, and then I decided that while I was feeling sarcastic and a bit grumpy and a bit silly (I don\u2019t understand how those two go together either, but sometimes they go together with me) I would go ahead and write the review. Perhaps it will come off sounding funny instead of irritated. Before I get started, let me first say that both the main characters show two qualities that I admire. The first is that they both have faith in God. Second, the both not only strive to, but do treat each other in honor and purity even though they are very attracted to each other. I also would like to say that the author did keep me turning pages even when I didn\u2019t particularly care for the book, which is why it got three stars.Now, let me begin on what I thought of MOST of the book. The beginning was the worst part. Could it have been anymore cheesy? One girl is about to be forced by her parents\u2019 vow to enter a life of celibacy (which, obviously is the worst fate that could befall any girl, right?). But then *gasp of surprise* someone discovers that there is a way out: if she finds true love and marries before midnight of heir eighteenth birthday (seriously, I am not joking.)So, three men compete for her hand. You will be shocked at who they are. A rich guy that flatters and gives rich gifts, a poet that brings flowers, and a tough guy who just plays hero sometimes, remains silent most of the time (what? You aren\u2019t surprised?).The middle part of the book was rather interesting, when mysterious accidents happened, but that part didn\u2019t last long. Guess which guy she went for? (How did you know it was the hero guy? Whoever sees that coming?)My biggest complaint really was who the bad guy turned out to be. Yes, she did succeed in horrifying me. Seriously, what is with Christian authors and making the priest into the evil guy? I wanted to throw the book away at that point.Although this book wasn\u2019t terrible, it wasn\u2019t great either.

Unfortunately, Rosemarie is Queen of the Mary Sues and is descended from a long line of Mary Sues: her parents died during the Plague because they insisted on being out in the kingdom to help the sick. Rosemarie has been on her own since then (?! the big, strong manly men were okay with a teenage girl running the realm??) and now she has a month to go until her 18th birthday when she'll enter into a convent. HOWEVER, a loophole was discovered which states that she's able to avoid life as a nun if she finds her true love and marries.What follows is essentially a medieval version of a reality dating show. The neighboring duke brings three knights to woo Rosemarie and my eyes were rolling with each sentence. It reached the point where I couldn't stand hearing again about Rosemarie's beauty, how kind and caring she is, how the townsfolk love her. At one point Rosemarie pouts because two knights showered her with elaborate gifts (jewels, gowns, etc) and the third didn't. Boo hoo.Multiple times Rosemarie muses on selling off possessions in the castle in order to give more to the poor villagers. Her subjects basically were a way to show just how selfless she was and it came across as cheesy. Numerous times Rosemarie delivers leftovers to people, bans all use of torture/punishment. There are better, more believable ways to show a compassionate character and An Uncertain Choice failed miserable in that sense.As for the title, there's nothing uncertain about it - there are two narrators, Rosemarie and the knight she ultimately chooses, so there's no surprise whatsoever. I ended up skimming the final few chapters and things ended exactly as I had assumed (baby and all.)

With dashing knights, dances, mysteries and romance, this book was not only entertaining for me, but one I\u2019d happily give and recommend to young adults. It\u2019s enjoyable and refreshing, as well as a voice and story that\u2019s needed in the YA genre. Not only did the story keep your attention from the first page, Hedlund effortlessly weaved important lessons throughout the pages. Lessons about discovering who you are and what courage you might not know you have. Plus lessons in love (which teens need today so desperately no?), like not settling, but being with someone who brings out their gifts, passions and desires in life. Have I mentioned that's especially important for the YA audience today?

Bergren ones. \u201cAn Uncertain Choice\u201d was very blunt and kind of, well, fluffy in the actually storyline but harsh in the torture. Lady Rosemarie was just a little too perfect; I\u2019m not sure how to explain it. I was already hesitant to read another Jody Hedlund book after her book released last year. Whether or not I\u2019ll read another by her, I\u2019m not sure. Link to review:http://booksforchristiangirls.blogspo...*BFCG may (Read the review to see) recommend this book by this author.

Rosemarie is such a wonderful character, so grateful to Hedlund for writing such an honorable and enjoyable YA Christian book that catches your attention from the first page :) This book is worth so much more than 5 stars to me, simply one of the best YA books I've ever read and definitely a favorite for 2015 <3 Simply loved the story from the first page! Rosemarie puts God and her people first and is ready to move to the convent on her 18th birthday as her parents requested before they died. She's even considering how to be an honorable ruler from the convent. Then the Duke, her father's best friend, comes around and proposes a challenge for Rosemarie to consider. She only wants to do God's will and lead her people in a worthy manner, her own desires were a distant third consideration to all of that.I REALLY wanted to know which knight presented himself in the beginning helping the torture ritual to stop. Couldn't relax until he was revealed and loved the scene which Rosemarie figured him out :) MINOR SPOILER.....................................................................................................................................................I also realized he had no money early on, but he had so much more to offer than riches.I won this book from Hedlund's giveaway and so thrilled to get a copy!! I also loved the ending and CAN'T WAIT for more YA books from Hedlund (hopefully Book 2 is on the way)!!!! Highly, highly recommend this for anyone looking for a cute and adventurous story with honor, family, and true love. My favorite knight was Derrick, but all three enhanced the plot greatly, big time thumbs up :)"}, {"userName": "Karleigh.Reads", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17554541-karleigh-reads", "userReview": "This was kindly sent my way from the publishers via Netgalley for an honest review.This is your typical find your true love before this date at midnight or be forever alone. Rosemary was promised as a baby to convent on her 18th birthday. Her godfather finds a loophole in the arrangement, if Rosemary can find her one true love before midnight of her 18th birthday then she doesn't have to live her life as a nun. Although I knew who was going to be her pick right off the bat, it was a very enjoyable book. It was a quick read, beautifully written, and just all around a solid book. There is action, mystery, twists and turns, but comes together in a very beautiful ending. I picked this book out because of the cover, I love this time era - of kinds and queens, courts and castles. I can't get enough of it. I loved the flirting and the courting in this book between Rosemary and the three men. It was fun to go through her journey of falling in love with one of the knights. Don't think this is just a sappy romance novel though, there is death, there is mystery, and most of what always happens in court - backstabbing. I enjoyed this book very much.4 out of 5 stars!!

I really loved it and enjoyed it so much! The love story was da bomb <3!!!! Sir Derrick is my dream husband written down into a book.However, despite this amazing love story, and the amazing rating I gave the book, I must warn a few things. This book is placed as youth fiction, but there are quite a few torture scenes in it that are surprisingly graphic and nearly made me gag a few times- and I'm an older teen, so I'm sure it would be quite disturbing for younger, more genteel teens and tweens.Also, the entire reason for there being a vow--which is the very basis for this book-- is extremely cultic and not at all a representation of true faith and Christianity.And third, there were a few minor details that I noticed were historically inaccurate to this time. But unless you are a historian and very picky and knowledgeable about these things, I am sure that you won't notice or be bothered by these things.But despite these three things, this book was very enjoyable and created an exciting story that I'm sure you'll love :)"}, {"userName": "Jo", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3721054-jo", "userReview": "I spent most of the book being so frustrated by the main character. She was the most indecisive protagonist I have ever seen. And don't even get me started on how much she needed a man to correct her faults and make her stronger.

They always end. What's a loyal reader to do? Keep reading, of course! Jody's latest is a little different than her usual historical romance fare, but a lot enjoyable. She's an author who never, ever disappoints. An Uncertain Choice is exciting, romantic, mysterious, and a tad gruesome. Medieval torture was, well, torturous.An Uncertain Choice combines all the expected elements of a Jody Hedlund story: strong, likeable characters; crackling romantic tension; fascinating historical detail; seemingly-insurmountable conflict; and a satisfying ending that elicits a sigh from the reader. Maybe two. About the story:\"Due to her parents' promise at her birth, Lady Rosemarie has been prepared to become a nun on the day she turns eighteen. Then, a month before her birthday, a friend of her father's enters the kingdom and proclaims her parents' will left a second choice--if Rosemarie can marry before the eve of her eighteenth year, she will be exempt from the ancient vow.Before long, Rosemarie is presented with the three most handsome and brave knights in the land. But when the competition for her heart seemingly results in a knight playing foul, she begins to wonder if the convent is the best place after all. If only one of the knights--the one who appears the most guilty--had not already captured her heart.\"Main character Lady Rosemarie is compassionate and strong-willed, and still learning how to lead her people. The three knights she meets in the competition for her heart and hand are likeable and honorable, with one in particular standing out among them. No spoilers, but sigh. He's a keeper. And in light of the furor over a particular book (and now, movie) that's out, I appreciate that Jody's latest story is all shades of appropriate for teenagers up through adults. Jody Hedlund is a superlative storyteller, and this young adult story proves Hedlund an author with no writing boundaries. I highly recommend An Uncertain Choice, and eagerly await Jody's next story."}, {"userName": "Katie (ReadiculousGirl)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10577582-katie-readiculousgirl", "userReview": "Thank you Zondervan Publishing for the ARC copy. In no way has this affected my review.\u201cAn Uncertain Choice\u201d was a well written story for the crowd it was aiming for, and I would\u2019ve really liked to have read this book back when I was in middle school. It is a cute story for young readers and fans of Melanie Dickerson\u2019s fairytale series. Although it was not necessarily my \"cup of tea,\" I think that the author accomplished her goal of creating a medieval fantasy story that a lot of teenagers would enjoy.My only real issue is that I feel like most Christian books base the majority of their stories off of the romance (at least that's how it comes across to me) rather than the main characters\u2019 individual worth and calling in life. Some try to combine romance with personal calling, but a lot of times it feels like a second thought or a last minute edit. I have found this to be quite widespread in the Christian genre, so I\u2019ve gotten used to it whenever I get an ARC, but I do wish that authors would try to break free of that mold more often. Because of the general predictability of these kinds of books, I can usually peg what's going to happen (who's bad and who ends up with who). Jody Hedlund did a good job of writing , but I am just not a huge fan of these kind of books due to that fact. Despite this, though, I can see a lot of young and adult readers enjoying this books, so don't write it off because of my review. \"An Uncertain Choice\" was a cute , clean read that could be fun for new and experienced readers alike."}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7102344-kara", "userReview": "My very first foray into Ms. Hedlund's writing! So many blogging friends have raved over her books which made me wish to read one. And when I heard that she had a YA book coming out, I just knew that would be the perfect one to start. I was right, this story is delightful! A heroine who learns how much strength she really has, three handsome knights to vie for her hand (and let me just say that a certain someone is very swoonworthy! ;), a villain who must be defeated, sword fighting, chivalry, a vow to contend with, and romantic adventures all combine to make for a wonderful story. I loved it! A quick easy read that made me smile at one moment, giggle at another, and shout hurrah when the good guys win. It is fairly short, which does mean that the romance moves rather rapidly. But they are both so sweetly earnest and cute that it doesn't matter in the least. And there's hints to the next story in the series, which has me anxious for it's publishing date! You should read this one. I'm positive that it'll make you grin. :)"}, {"userName": "Dina Sleiman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2643813-dina-sleiman", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed this medieval story with its Bachelorette twist.
