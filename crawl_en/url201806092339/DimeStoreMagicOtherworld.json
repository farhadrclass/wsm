If you want to join a fun and active reading group, join this one. They are not crazy, but definitely pushing the boundaries pretty hard. You can even get away with barely participating, like me, and still be a happy member.Okay, now that the commercial is over.So, this book was about a witch, Paige, who has custody of a seriously bratty teenager who has strong magic. Let's just say that rebellious bratty kids with the power to hex adults is a really really bad idea. We learn this a few times when her little spells ended up in much bloodshed.But, there are others who want bratty teen-witch for their own, and they are suing Paige for custody. Yes, this book is a custody battle. And, like all legal battles, there will be lying, scheming, murder, mayhem, zombies... and worst of all- lawyers...For the first part of the book I was seriously wondering if I could get through it. There were summons', legal maneuvering, and depositions going on. It was that same feeling as when we all got excited that the Star Wars franchise was going to make prequels and then we got senate meetings for two hours.Oh my gosh, could they ruin it any more than this?Yes. Yes, they could.Luckily, this was no regular legal battle, though. There was a hella lot more killing going on. So, it wasn't too boring. Just a bit boring.Speaking of boring... our heroine meets her hero in the form of a young lawyer that is going to help her. She describes him as looking bland. She says that he's the kind of person you see and then forget a minute later. I would also describe his personality as bland. He's the kind of guy that won't laugh at a joke, but will point out the scientific errors in it. He's the kind of guy who will tell you when it is appropriate to use the word \"whom\". Stand back, ladies, he's taken!Yes, our hero is a Hispanic version of Dwight. I'm not sure about his stance on beets.Much like Dwight, though, this guy grows on you. He is always there for Paige when she needs him, and he is very steady in every way. I know, I know, your ovaries are probably quivering by now, but like I said, he's taken. You missed your shot.Overall, when it came to rating this book and I was hovering over the stars, when the two-star rating came up as \"it was okay\", I felt like it completely captured my complex feelings over this book. It's like a mind-reader or something.Will I read the next one? Maybe, if it is with the group. No, if it is dependent upon my motivation to read it on my own."}, {"userName": "Alex is The Romance Fox", "userReviewDate": "Dec 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6663962-alex-is-the-romance-fox", "userReview": "I somehow missed reading this book, which is the 3rd novel in Kelley Armstrong\u2019s Women of the Otherworld series and as I loved this series, decided that I wanted to know more about Paige Winterbourne.Synopsis: Leader of the American Coven, guardian to the preteen daughter of a black witch \u2026 it\u2019s not the lifestyle twenty-three year-old Paige Winterbourne imagined for herself, and it\u2019s wreaking hell on her social life.But she\u2019s up to the challenge.

That was a pleasant surprise, since the first book in the series was kind of hard to push through... However, the second and third books are starting to grow on me and I think the author is growing as well \ud83d\ude0a! This book is about the young witch Savannah and her efforts to get used to her new family, her powers, and figuring out what is acceptable or not, very much in keeping with every single teenager in the heat of puberty, only when throwing a tantrum she can level a city block down to dust! Talk about a need for anger management before anything else \ud83d\ude08... Savannah is the prize in a custody battle between her new guardian and her newly discovered father, who is a big shot sorcerer. His newly acquired desire to play daddy dearest is the fact that Savannah is an emergent powerful witch and the reputation of his house can really grow \ud83d\udc46 if she became a part of their daily operation. In Page, her current foster mom and tutor in the good-witch arts, she has a woman who is growing to love her more with every passing day and is passionate about making sure to keep her on the side of the good guys. It sucks that so many of those who are supposed to be among the good guys are making it so hard on the two young women... And don't get me started on supposed good lawyers... Ghhhhhrrrrrr! But, maybe there is one of the Lawyer persuasion, young, Hispanic, and new to the court proceedings, who might be brave and brazen enough to stand in their corner and go against a powerful House of Wizards... Maybe \ud83d\ude00! Oo, and maybe he is a total nerd and has hardly any personality, but I still think he is adorable \ud83d\ude0e!There is a recurring appearance by a bitch villain and some really spooky stuff happening in a funeral parlor, which gave this volume some creepy vibe and didn't leave any space for relaxation - once the action took off, it didn't let up! I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series and hope the author cuts back even more on the info dumps the first book was so riddled with. This was sooooo much better!

Willing to give it a shot, after taking the dive I didn't want to emerge again. Paige is awesome - while I may still like Elena a wee bit better, her story was just as good. Paige and Savannah have been living together since the horrors that took place during Stolen, and not only are some not happy about it *cough* snooty coven *cough*, there is now a custody battle brewing that involves the super powerful Cabal and former villain Leah. Help comes from an unlikely place in the form of Lucas, a new intro for the series and someone I hope sticks around. There's some legal play going down but it's mainly a battle of the magic, set ups and luck. The office scene with the lawyer ending his career was kind of epic.Paige grinded on my nerves some by not getting over some of her paranoia toward Lucas, but once she thaws out she's great. Loved the development of their bond. Lucas is described as a little generic and scrawny; he speaks with a lawyer's spiel and uptight manner for most of the book, but this just makes him more endearing. He's passionate about causes, he's protected for the weak, he's trying to make his way in the world. Savannah acts like a pre-teen girl which is annoying at least half the time.The book wins with its storyline because there are different forces pushing against them, plenty of tension, action is kept strong, and personal relationships better the characters actually keep me caring. If I had to say a bad thing, it'd be Paige's naivitiy with falling into some of the traps was annoying. The funeral home, come on!If you've shied away from reading more of the series because you don't want head-swapping, I assure you Paige's story is filled with magic, dimension, and all sorts of Urban Fantasy goodies."}, {"userName": "Niki Hawkes - The Obsessive Bookseller", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13396599-niki-hawkes---the-obsessive-bookseller", "userReview": "Dual Review: Dime Store Magic & Industrial MagicIt took me a loooooong time to get around to continuing this series with Dime Store Magic. I loved Bitten and Stolen, but found myself a little bitter that the series would start following different characters from there. I think my overall sentiment was \u201cwell, if continuing is going to feel like starting a new series, it doesn\u2019t matter when I read them (salty reader, party of one).\u201d For the most part, that was true. The story in books 3&4 focuses on Paige and her involvement in the witch and sorcerer communities (Elena\u2019s story is a footnote, and werewolves take a backseat to other supernatural beings). It does tie back to Stolen, but more in a spin-off kind of way.I\u2019m not going to lie \u2013 I didn\u2019t hate it.I think I can see what Armstrong is trying to do with the series, and think nowadays I\u2019m more in the mood to appreciate a series that takes a little longer to get to the payoff. What it has going for it are interesting and sassy female characters (I think Paige is one of the most relatable uf leads I\u2019ve come across even if she is a little typical), good mysteries, romance, and writing that you can really lose yourself in. The story components weren\u2019t earth-shattering, but I absolutely love where I think it\u2019s going and look forward to seeing through some potential plot points.Dime Store Magic offered a good Kate Daniels/Julie* relationship between Paige and Savannah and had a lot of excellent witchy moments (by witchy I mean supernatural spell casting and other creepy shit). It also had a decently organic romance, which I always appreciate. I finished this book feeling genuinely excited to see where the story went next. I even picked up Industrial Magic within a couple weeks (a turnaround that\u2019s pretty unheard of with me). *Side note: I realize this was probably written before the KD series, but as I\u2019m a super fan of that one now, everything must be compared. ;PIndustrial Magic was less about Paige\u2019s relationships and more about the politics and dynamics within the witch and sorcerer communities (with a dash of necromancer and vampire). It expanded the plot sufficiently for me even though the story went in a different direction than I was expecting. It was much more inclusive of other supernatural groups, which made the whole world feel more robust and well-developed. The further I read, the more I appreciate how Armstrong is writing this series.Overall, comparing books 3&4 to 1&2 is like apples to oranges. They\u2019re still fruit sitting together in the same basket, but the sampling experience is vastly different. Elena\u2019s story was more carnal and sensory, whereas I would call Paige\u2019s more thoughtful and conceptual. Armstrong did a great job adapting her storytelling to both of these unique POVs, but I can see how such a drastic change caused a lot of readers to complain of a quality decline. They say the apples aren\u2019t as good; I say that\u2019s because you bit into an orange when you were expecting an apple.Recommendations: I personally think there\u2019s more than one type of urban fantasy, and books 3&4 strike a very different note than books 1&2 (as discussed above). As someone who likes most types, I\u2019d recommend both as long as you\u2019re prepared for the change. These haven\u2019t landed at the top of my uf list yet, but they\u2019re making a very compelling (and entertaining) case. :)Via The Obsessive Bookseller at www.NikiHawkes.com Other books you might like:"}, {"userName": "valee", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2320890-valee", "userReview": "Well, what can I say? I'm definitely hooked! Even more than what I want to admit. Maybe it is because I was so sure I would not like this series. Of course no complains from me as this series turned out to be a wonderful surprise which I was definitely not expecting.Even though in this installment we get things from Paige's POV, which I thought would be extremely boring as I did not liked her in the previous book, we still get to read about this same world which is captivating me little by little. I like that in a paranormal series, to start book by book and get to know a bit more of that new world with each new installment we get to read. And I definitely love it when we get to read about a lot of different paranormal species in a same series.This installment is specifically about witches and sorcerers, but we still get glimpses about the other species as well. I thought it would't be interesting to read about them, but it ended up being original and refreshing. The author made a terrific work with the world building and the description of this two species, so elaborated that I just got sucked into the story. Read the whole book in a day, couldn't put it down.I'm just not giving 5 stars still because the endings in this series are always incomplete, not exactly cliff hangers, just torturing little details you wanna know about but you never do. As we know there are still many more books so I am not worried about it, but I am a very curious person to be completely satisfied with a book without having all the information explained at the end. I can understand cliff hangers because they are about situations and actions, but in this case we just know somethings will come in the future and we just have to wait for the other books to see it.Just wanna clarify that from now on I am a fan!

I loved the shifter characters featured in the first two books: Bitten and Stolen. In the second book: Stolen, I tolerated the witches that were introduced and seemed to slowly but surely take over the plot. Now in the third book, the shifters appear to be totally absent - this story is only about the witches. I'm not a happy reader right now since the only reason I follow this series is for the shifter pack.However...Even though I want to thoroughly enjoy my temper tantrum, I must take a moment to say Dime Store Magic wasn't a bad book. I wish it was so I would be justified in hating it but to be honest the story was fairly engaging. Needless to say, I didn't enjoy the characters much at all, and if this series continues with the witches then I may have to drop it so please tell me that Elena, Clay, Jeremy, and the rest of the family will be coming back...please!!!! My favorite quote:\"She threw open her arms, embraced me, planted a kiss on my lips, then another on my left breast. I yelped...I grabbed the nearest discarded robe. \"Could you please put this-- Could you all put these-- Could you get dressed, please?\" The woman only bestowed a serene smile on me. \"We are as the Goddess requires.\" \"The Goddess requires you to be naked on my lawn?\" \"We aren't naked child, we're skyclad.\"...\"That's --uh--very-- I mean--\" I stammered. Be polite, I reminded myself. Witches should respect Wiccans, even if we didn't quite get the whole Goddesss-Worship thing. I knew some Wiccans, and they were very nice people, though I must admit they'd never arrived in my backyard naked and kissed my tits before.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Alkyoni", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3720870-alkyoni", "userReview": "Been four years since I read the previous book. So, even though I don't remember the details, I do remember the feeling after finishing Bitten and Stolen (Books 1 & 2). Underwhelmed pretty much covers it.For some reason that I can't really explain, I wasn't all that into Elena and Clay's story the way that most fans of the series were. I liked the writing, the world building, the action, but not the characters. I didn't like them but I didn't dislike them either, I just couldn't bring myself to care about what happens to them. So it was with a heavy heart that I picked this one up, considering that most readers found it to be a lesser instalment in the series after the werewolf stories. And what do you know? I loved it.Yeap, the odd one out once again, forever alone, call it what you want but I loved Dime Store Magic. The funny thing is that the MC, Paige, was in the previous book as well and I can't even remember her. I loved her in this one. She's tough, she's smart, she's funny, she's stubborn, she's lost, she's the girl next door and one that most readers will be able to relate to.Savannah, well... She's 13 and a major pain in the ass. A total brat and not in the endearing term of the word. Reading about the two of them trying to understand each other, hell, to communicate, was frustrating and the same time totally understandable. Considering Savannah's upbringing and the events of the previous book, it would have been completely unrealistic to have it any other way.Lucas... *sigh* I am alone in this one but I have a crush on him. His looks are average (Paige says that you wouldn't remember him 5 minutes after meeting him), he is a total nerd, he talks like Sheldon from the Big Bang Theory, he can't throw a punch to save his life, but he is so ADORABLE. He wants to make the world a better place and he offers his services to people in need (something like the cloaked crusader in a permanent Clark Kent disguise, according to Paige).Keep in mind that this is an UF, not a PNR, so don't expect much on romance. Paige and Lucas do fall for each other, but that's a very minor part of the story and it happens well past the first half of the book.What you can expect is a good written story, with much more information on the creatures of the Otherworld, lots of action, some funny moments and little romance thrown in to spice things up."}, {"userName": "Anastasia \uff7c", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6753356-anastasia", "userReview": "A really good read."}, {"userName": "Fables&Wren", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42780417-fables-wren", "userReview": "WrensReads Review:I absolutely adore Paige and identify with her purely.If you haven\u2019t read the first two books of this series, you need to turn that little butt right around and march to your library and check out Elena\u2019s books Bitten and Stolen. Even though these stories are not always told by the same person, there is a flow to them. Like, for example, Paige and Savannah were not only introduced in the second book, Stolen, but they also rely heavily on the set up into this story.Paige is a young twenty-something witch who is taking care of a tween named Savannah. Both of their mother\u2019s died (reasons in the last book, Stolen) and they are constantly trying to make it work.Well, here comes a Volo (telekinetic) half-demon cop named Leah who just really wants Savannah for some reason. Seriously I don\u2019t know why she is so bent out of shape about her. She wants custody over the girl. But she isn\u2019t a relative or anything.In order to lay her claim, Leah goes and finds Savannah's dad. For some reason she believes that it is a sorcerer who is a big bad business lawyer, Nast Cabal. The Cabal thing is just too much for me to explain for you. It's kind of like Wolfram and Hart (TV show Angel, Buffyverse) except they are all sorcerers and family members? There are different branches for each family? You\u2019ll have to read to find out exactly who they are. There are satanic rituals, house burnings, running from the police, grave digging, conjuring demons, unexplained deaths and the dead walking in this book. The story itself is literally the most entertaining thing. You won\u2019t get bored.Now, the writing on the other hand\u2026 is literally better. Armstrong does not disappoint when it comes to writing in a way that makes you laugh and makes you feel for the characters she wants you to. Paige is nothing like Elena, yet she is everything and more. I love Elena and Paige for different reasons and I am happy that more than one character has been the center of a book.Not to mention Lucas is 100% legit.Get into this series if you like risky things, gore, horror, supernatural, twist, and nonstop wonderfulness.WrensReads | Goodreads | Twitter | Instagram"}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "I haven't yet read Armstrong's \"Bitten\" or \"Stolen\" so had to pay very close attention to the first few chapters to get the feel of this world and figure out who was who and what they had to do with the current story but now that I've got most of it figured out the pages are flying. Paige is tough and gutsy and vulnerable as well. And I'm digging the gore, the suspense, the wise-a*s humor and the tension (sexual and otherwise). Kind of reminds of very early Laurell K. Hamilton before she became sex obsessed to the point where a coherent plot was no longer an option ;)The action is pretty much non-stop and the secret world of witches and cabals working behind the modern day world is well done and a nice take on things. The fact that they have to hide their abilities from normal folks is a nice touch and adds a touch of realism to the plot but I'm a little annoyed at the author for taking such obvious joy at poking fun at modern day Wiccans in the \"They Aren't Naked, they're Skyclad.\" chapter. Her Wiccans all seem to be a bit loony and stereotypical . . .This was an enjoyable read with some great action, humor, romance and characterization but at times I feel like I was missing something when past events were mentioned in passing and probably should have read this series in order."}, {"userName": "Delirious Disquisitions ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5831406-delirious-disquisitions", "userReview": "You should read this if you like:  witch mythology with a twist, blood magic, covens, cults, non-skinny protagonists, slow-burn romance, small towns, necromancy, slight gore, and mild horror.Dime Store Magic reminds me of that time I went to watch Avatar with my whole family. I mean, what an interesting concept! What graphics! But ultimately, I was bored out of my mind and fell asleep halfway through the movie. Same with this, expect the boredom was compounded by about 30%. And I fell asleep multiple times. *shrugs*I picked this for a change of genre since I've been reading fantasy non stop for a while. Having read the first couple of books in the series, I was interested to explore more of this supernatural world. However, I think I might just stick to the Werewolves in this series. Compared to the Werewolf lore from Bitten and Stolen, the witch/sorcerer mythology kind of paled in comparison. Like its Puritan origins, the witch's Coven in Dime Store Magic are abysmally boring, steeped in petty superstition, and run by a trio of old, narrow minded women. The dialogues in this book made me want to pull my hair out! Nothing ever gets done in this Coven because of the sheer paranoia of the Elders. It was frustrating how they just refused to change, or listen to reason, or do literally anything helpful! Honestly, reading about this town and its people just made me feel terribly claustrophobic. If that was the author's intent, then I applaud you for doing such a terrific job of it. It wasn't a very pleasant experience however, and I don't think I would like to repeat it anytime soon. The other problem I had was with the characters. I just, I felt nothing for them? Any of them? Expect maybe Savannah. I've never been the maternal sort. I'm not too fond of kids and don't ever want any for myself. Dime Store Magic just confirmed those feelings. There were times, while reading this book, that I seriously just wanted Paige to dump Savannah's whiny ass on the side of the road and set it on fire. Savannah is hands down the most fucking annoying teenage brat I've ever read about. I hated literally every. single .thing about this child. And honestly, no one was happier when she finally realized how much shit she is in. Like child, you need to fucking listen to your guardian for once in your God damned life or else she will end up dead and literally you only have yourself to blame! Ugh!!! I get she's 13.

I'm not sure why because I really did enjoy Bitten. I have a feeling it was one of those times where I picked up the first book and I had a pile of other stuff to read and I just never circled back to it. I enjoyed Stolen the second book in the series, although not as much as the first. I was skeptical about Dime Store Magic because I didn't like Paige when I encountered her in the second book. I felt bad for her at times, but my feelings about Paige were much like Clay's about Paige. I was annoyed she was around interfering with the series.Dime Store Magic revolves around a custody dispute over a young witch. Most of the book is an idiot plot, as in the main character has to be an idiot for the plot to move forward. Paige makes the wrong choice at every turn and walks into some very obvious traps. I can forgive a lot of it, but when she gets a phone call requesting she go to the funeral home where a man she's been accused of murdering is being waked... who would say 'gee golly okay, let's go.' No one. There was absolutely no reason the paperwork she was going to retrieve couldn't be sent to her via UPS. She walked into a trap that was built off a situation that had ALSO been a trap. Paige is an idiot and you have to spend 400 plus pages with her.I didn't think she was a particularly good guardian and I didn't have a lot of interest in the coven side story so it was really hard for me to be emotionally invested in any of this. A lot of universe rules were broken in this book, including characters risking exposure they normally wouldn't risk. There's a whole scene at a funeral home that's totally implausible given the world building and the fact that Kelley Armstrong's universe is a hidden universe, meaning it exists within the one we all occupy. It's not so hidden with corpses flying around. I'm sorry, but I can only buy hidden universe stories if the hiding is taken seriously by the occupants of the world.The romance is lackluster... the big sex scene was weird! I'm all for smut! I'm all for magic smut! I thought the sex scenes in Bitten and Stolen were well written... but this? Paige and Lucas didn't have a lot of chemistry to begin with and then when they finally sleep together it's all magic fireballs and radios. Also, I've never had a man stop kissing me when sex was fast approaching so he could like tune the radio station. I get what Armstrong was trying to do here. She had magical people, she had the opportunity to write a magical sex scene, but I just wasn't sold on how it happened or when it happened... I was mostly embarrassed to be reading it.Unfortunately I was doing therapeutic book buying when I picked up Kelley's books. I own them all. I don't know if this means I'm going to skip the next one to preserve myself, take a long break between three and four, or if I'm just going to swallow the fourth book as a loss and move onto five."}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "At the end of Stolen, Paige took custody of Savannah--an arrangement that promised to be entertaining as at age 22, Paige was only roughly ten years her senior.

But this goes more in-depth with her character and she is much cooler than I first thought.Not only has she taken teenage witch Savannah under her wing, she is also coven leader to a group of crusty old witches who would rather hide than stand up for anything.She then finds herself being targeted by half-demons & sorcerers who are claiming family connections with Savannah and she has a battle on her hands!Enter the lovable Cortez and things start to get real interesting!

Kelley Armstrong has a series of books out with supernatural characters. I whipped through Bitten, Stolen, Dime Store Magic, Industrial Magic, Haunted and Broken in no time at all.The first two and the last books have as their main character the lone female werewolf in the world. The third and fourth book have a young witch as the focal point and the fifth one features the story of a dead (but ghostly) witch.These were really good. My favorite topics, sex and violence, are in there but there's also a lot about personal relationships and a well developed world that the characters reside in.The books share the same characters throughout. The stories and characters actually show growth which is nice.

I can\u2019t believe that it\u2019s already been ten years since I first read this book.After the events of Stolen, Paige Winterbourne has taken in thirteen year old Savannah Levine whose mother recently died. Savannah is a powerful witch for her age, but impulsive. It\u2019s a dangerous combination that has the Nast Cabal (the supernatural equivalent of the mafia) tearing Paige\u2019s life apart in a bid for custody. As her life continues to crumble around her, Paige is forced to accept assistance from Lucas Cortez, a young lawyer with his own motives for helping.I decided to read Dime Store Magic again because I didn\u2019t give Paige a fair shot the first time around. When I first read this, it was immediately after devouring the first two books in the series, which feature werewolf Elena Michaels. I had adored Elena and wasn\u2019t excited to discover that the next book's narrator was going to be the twenty-something witch from Stolen. (Especially, since I hadn\u2019t cared for Paige in that story.) While I had ended-up enjoying Dime Store Magic on my first reading, I still thought Paige was a little lack luster. It wasn\u2019t until later in the series that I got into her and Lucas, as characters. So, I\u2019m glad I did a re-read as I was able to appreciate them more this time around.The most interesting thing about going back to this book was seeing just how far Armstrong has come with her characters and the world. There were several moments in the story where I thought Paige, Lucas, and the ideas behind witches were rather shaky and clich\u00e9d. It felt like Armstrong wasn\u2019t sure where she wanted to take the characters at this point in the series. Despite this, I still enjoyed the book enough that I might also re-read Industrial Magic. Overall, my grade for this book didn\u2019t change. I would recommend Dime Store Magic to fans of the series, but I don\u2019t think I would suggest you start off with this book. If you\u2019re looking to get into the Women of the Otherworld series, I would suggest starting out with Bitten."}, {"userName": "Siobhan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35855553-siobhan", "userReview": "Dime Store Magic is the third book in the Women of the Otherworld series, and as with the prior two books it\u2019s a great read.\u00a0With this one, we see a change in perspective and at first I wasn\u2019t quite sure how I was going to enjoy it. Through the first two books I was really pulled into the werewolf world and knowing a change was coming had left me tentative. Yes, I\u2019d enjoyed the introduction to the other supernatural parts of the world we got to see in Stolen but I wasn\u2019t sure where things would go. Fortunately, I very quickly found myself pulled into the story. \u00a0Paige turned out to be a very interesting character, giving us a very different viewpoint to that given in the first two books. The way the story was told from her perspective really pulled you in, leaving you entertained throughout, giving you a much wider view of the supernatural world. Looking at the witching world, it was a very different kind of story to that in the first two books. Yes, there was links, but at the same time it was a completely unique story. \u00a0Honestly, the development of the witching world was my favourite aspect of the story. We only got a glimpse of it in the prior book, but in this one we got a much better understanding of the witching world. Learning the rules and watching the interactions was so much fun, especially as we found out more regarding the divide between witches and warlocks. \u00a0That brings me nicely to my next point. Whilst the romantic element in this one was rather predictable, I really enjoyed watching it unfold. The romance in this was completely different to that seen in the prior book, ensuring the story was as far away from the prior books as possible in as many was as could be. We have a completely different personality with our main character; we have a completely different romance story; we have a completely different plotline. All in all, it works well to make this books stand on its own whilst remaining linked to the main series.\u00a0Honestly, this book is very different to the prior two books and I loved this change. It moves the entire series forward through introducing us to many new aspects of the world, allowing us to see things from another perspective, all whilst having a unique feel about it.\u00a0I really do need to get my hands on book four and continue on with this wonderful series."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250020-tatiana", "userReview": "\"Dime Store Magic\" is the third book in Women of the Otherworld series. It is narrated from the POV of Paige, a Coven witch introduced in the second book of the series. The story is centered on Savannah, a powerful teenage witch who is taken care of by Paige. A custody battle ensues when Savannah's sorcerer father tries to bring the girl to his Cabal. He does it with the help of telekinetic half-demon Leah, also introduced in \"Stolen.\" Paige quickly finds herself overwhelmed by both legal and magical assaults on her and Savannah and is forced to resort to the help of an unlikely ally - a sorcerer lawyer Lucas Cortez.Once again, Armstrong creates a very convincing world of witches and sorcerers, Covens and Cabals, spells and rituals. I thought the hierarchies, the structures of the societies of the two races, even politics and history were very well thought out and written, and yet for some reason I wasn't taken by this new world as much as I was by the werewolf world in \"Bitten\" and \"Stolen.\" Maybe it has something to do with overwhelming presence of elderly women and lack of strong sexy men, maybe I prefer violent cut-throat world of werewolves more, or maybe witches are simply not my thing. The romance part also lacked. Paige's love interest Lucas is a nice enough guy, but nothing more. He is rather uptight, proper, and a bit goody-goody for my taste. This book certainly missed the passion and drama of Clay/Elena relationship. Plus, the entire romance part was very secondary to the main story line and introduced almost as an afterthought.I will continue reading the series, maybe I will warm up to Paige and Lucas in the next book about them. Also, I am curious to see what will come out of Savannah's character. Right now she is one spoiled and snarky 13-year old. I think she will make a great protagonist in the future books (I heard she'll narrate books 11 and 12 of the series)."}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2295424-mel", "userReview": "[killing Kristof (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "planetkimi", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/680012-planetkimi", "userReview": "I think the best part is the background lore.

I hope S's hormones fall into line ... for Paige's sake. :P They have sort of an Obi-Wan/Anakin type of relationship where the reckless student is more powerful than the beleaguered mentor. So when Savannah causes trouble, the audience isn't sure to what extent Paige is going to be able to solve it, and it's an interesting cause of tension.The romantic element was predictable and thus pretty uninteresting.

I skipped Book 2 because fuck Elena and her whiny bullshit, but I wanted to give a second chance to Women of the Underworld. I'm so happy I did! Even though I was a little lost at times (especially during the first few chapters), I ended up really enjoying Paige's book.Elena and Paige were exact opposites. Elena was your average Mary-Sue who was the most super speshul woman in the world. She was handed every amazing opportunity on a silver plate, which she knocked away then threw herself on the floor to have a hissy fit about \"poor me\", only to have 7 hot guys rush to baby her. She was selfish, shallow and thoroughly unlikable. Paige was 100% what I'd call a strong female lead. She wasn't Rambo. She wasn't an emotionless murderer. She was just an average girl (plus witchy powers) who kept getting knocked down, betrayed and spat on. BUT, she didn't run away, even when she was lost or scared. She stood up for her loved ones and sure, she had plenty of fears and limitations - she wasn't the strongest or the prettiest, but she kept pushing herself. And THAT is exactly what made her special to me.As for Lucas, he was a refreshing lead - he didn't walk around half naked, defeating the evils of the world with his chest hair. He was geeky and also a little lost, but he fought for a better world even if it put him in danger. I'm excited to start Book 4 (still with Lucas and Paige) although I'm a bit apprehensive about the rest. I feel like Kelly Armstrong already included the best and worst kind of heroines so I guess I'm expecting all future ones to at least be likeable."}, {"userName": "Carmel (Rabid Reads)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4561998-carmel-rabid-reads", "userReview": "Reviewed by: Rabid ReadsI was pleasantly surprised by Dime Store Magic when I read it this second time around. My first reading was a bit disappointing because witches replace werewolves as the main characters and that's not a fair trade in my books. Now that I've read nearly the whole series I was able to better appreciate Kelley's third Women of the Otherworld novel. I really enjoyed going back in time and meeting Savannah all over again as well as witnessing the begins of Paige and Lucas' relationship. I'd forgotten a good chunk of the history of witches/sorcerers too so it was a great refresher. This is Paige's first chance to shine as a narrator in this series and I enjoyed her point of view a great deal. Miss Winterbourne hasn't had it easy lately: she lost her mom in the previous installment and gained a teenage ward. Definitely not a fair trade in my books but that's life! I was shocked by how much more I enjoyed Paige this second time around. Originally I found her character to be too weak and naive for my liking but that's not actually the case. Elena is a hard act to follow and although Winterbourne doesn't possess the might of a werewolf, her strength lies in her relationships. Paige is willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for Savannah; she's prepared to give up life as she knows it and all that she holds dear in order for her ward to have a good life. In my eyes, there's nothing nobler than sacrificing oneself for another, especially a child.Lucas and Paige didn't exactly get off to the best start when they first met. I'd forgotten how much they butted heads in the beginning. The couple that I know now are solid in their relationship and are a real power team. That's definitely not the case in Dime Store Magic! As natural enemies (sorcerer/witch) their confrontations are explosive and when you throw in a teenage witch coming into her powers you're left with a real mess. I think I enjoyed the back-and-forth between the characters more than the plot's main conflict. Lucas and Paige are adorable together even when they're at odds. I liked the trade-spell-for-spell deal that they initiate in this installment as well. When they finally do get together it's quite magical. Literally! Kelley lays out the history of sorcerers and witches in this installment which in itself is a gripping read. Paige explains things from the Coven's perspective, Lucas from the Cabals' and Savannah chimes in too. Combined they provide a pretty well-rounded view of their magical past. Winterbourne also uncovers an interesting secret regarding their grimoires as well that I found fascinating. I like that Armstrong dug as deep as she did into the witch universe. These details aren't crucial to the overall plot but added an extra level of depth that I appreciate as a reader. It just makes the Women of the Otherworld all the more real in my eyes.Other than a few brief phone calls to Elena, this book has very little to do with its predecessors and as a result, it's not essential to have read the previous novels in order to fully understand this one. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't though! Clay and Elena will forever remain my favorite fictional couple but Lucas and Paige are definitely up there. Dime Store Magic is a fun book full of challenges, magic and budding relationships. I enjoyed the story a lot more this second time around and I can't wait to revisit Industrial Magic next month!"}], "description": "Paige Winterbourne was always either too young or too rebellious to succeed her mother as leader of one of the world's most powerful elite organizations- the American Coven of Witches.
