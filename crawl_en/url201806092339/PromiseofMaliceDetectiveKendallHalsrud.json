From the very first page the action starts and doesn't ease up until the last page. In Promise of Malice, Kendall, a detective for the Eau Claire Police Department, finds herself a victim, but she's not the last. There are girls out there turning up raped and dead, with a telling sign on every body. Do they have a killer on the loose or a rapist? After her attack Kendall finds on forced absence from work as a detective. In order to help solve the case she has to agree to work with Adam Nashland, her amnesiac lover, who doesn't remember their relationship. Putting her hurt and anger aside, Kendall teams up with Nash, and her next door neighbor Brynn, to find a rapist turned murderer before he finds her. Set against the beautiful backdrop of Northern Wisconsin, Promise of Malice will have you on the edge of your seat until the last woman is safe. The question is, will Kendall come out of this case alive and with her heart intact? There's only one way to find out! I give Promise of Malice 5 cups of better put that coffee in a travel mug, 'cause it's gonna be a bumpy ride!"}, {"userName": "Nancy Silk", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7140636-nancy-silk", "userReview": "\"Non-Stop Action With Compelling Characters\"In this third book of the series, Kendall becomes a date rape victim...well, almost! She and Russell Nielson had dated for a few months. When he forcefully tried to take advantage of her, she out-powered him. Because of her attack on Russell, her boss is fearful of a police brutality suit, thus she is soon suspended from her police job. She's decided to join Adam \"Nash\" Nashlund who has been hired to locate a man's missing wife. Months earlier, she and Adam had been seriously injured while capturing a horrific criminal. Kendall healed well, but Nash had serious head and leg injuries which resulted in loss of memory. He cannot remember the loving relationship he had with Kendall before his head injuries. The missing wife is linked with the multiple serial rape events. The rapist has a unique way of leaving lasting memories on his victims... tattoos of a Reiki symbol. This story is obsessive ... I could not put it down. It's very well written, spellbinding, and thought provoking. High recommend."}, {"userName": "bonnie kirchner", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42778629-bonnie-kirchner", "userReview": "Promise of MaliceThis was a very good series.
