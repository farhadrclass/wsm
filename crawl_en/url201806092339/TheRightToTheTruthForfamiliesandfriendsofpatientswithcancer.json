The book reaches out to all cancer patients who try to cope with the fact that their health is failing, as well as people who find out bad news for a loved one and feel lost and even the patient's caregivers who must deliver him the bad news...How should they do it and most importantly, why is the truth absolutely necessary, despite its bitterness?

In fact, it denounces the disastrous tactics of concealing a patient's diagnosis from him, or even worse, lying shamelessly to him. The author reports numerous examples from his long experience of patients who ended up completely ruined, not physically, by the oblivious state their doctors or their family members had deliberately put them into. Caught myself being 100% absorbed reading the stories by the lively narration and the author's excellent writing skills. Certainly recommend it not only to patients, but to medical - paramedical staff and relatives of patients."}, {"userName": "Tasos", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52567468-tasos", "userReview": "Touching.
