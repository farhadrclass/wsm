Taking place in 1923 Soledad City, New Mexico in the early days of statehood and using exquisite prose that we do not often find in contemporary novels, I rate this novel 4.5 stars. Ben Lewis Morales is a young judge and is often compared to both his father and the honorable Judge Hochstadter. Day to day life in Soledad City during prohibition is boring on an exciting day, and the profession of judge usually entails reading and writing briefs. That changes one day in May 1923 when Bryan Talbot is charged with strangling his wife Louise to death. Talbot maintains his innocence and employs defense attorney Oliver Parmelee. The state counters with defense lawyer Alfred Dietrich. The case proceeds, according to an older Judge Lewis reminiscing, to make daily life interesting over an otherwise dull summer, and does not end until additional people are dead. Yet, what makes this courtroom drama different than contemporary books of this genre, is that we are offered a glimpse into Judge Lewis' personal life. The Judge resides with his professional mother Eulalia Morales Lewis. We see the Judge's struggle to live up to his father's judicial record as well his own personal struggle to find a wife who measures up to his mother's expectations. Becker offers a secondary plot of Judge Lewis learning how to love as an adult versus an adolescent even though he has reached the age of twenty-nine. This sparked my interest as Becker fleshed out Eulalia's character and background so the reader could sympathize with Judge Lewis' quest to find a wife that appeals to both him and his mother. This takes up as much of Lewis' emotional energy as the legal proceedings do. I enjoyed reading about Judge Lewis and the other characters of Soledad City. Becker has the judge quote Gibbon, Aristotle, and 1600s French thinkers in his briefs. Meanwhile we learn much about the legal system of the 1920s. New Mexico is a long way from Washington and has state control over most of her legal issues including the court and prohibition. In many ways it is still more of a Wild West society of bandits and Rangers than a member of the United States. It is in this context that Judge Lewis writes his memorable brief on the Talbot case. I am glad that I uncovered Stephen Becker. He wrote and translated many books before his death including an award winning biography of Marshall Field. A Covenant of Death was a real find, and even though it is told through the eyes of a 63 year old judge rather than a girl, I can see how the comparisons to To Kill a Mockingbird arose. For its unique perspective and wonderful prose, I rate A Covenant With Death 4.5 stars and look forward to revisiting Stephen Becker's memorable writing."}, {"userName": "Camie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie", "userReview": "This is a short book which packs a lot of punch.

It begins as a stylish mystery and rises to lofty and inspiring heights. It simply does everything right. The narrator is extremely credible, a young man recently appointed as District Judge. He maintains a continuous thread of sarcasm and humor that keeps a balance with the more serious nature of the murder case being tried. Great court room drama, and the final few scenes were as rewarding and noble as any ever put on a page. The actual content encompasses far more than I could begin to describe.

That's what I thought when I found this tattered paperback that was in a stack of old books that had belonged to my great aunt. This .75 book (it is printed on the front right side of the cover) was written in 1964 and was obviously read until it fell to pieces by my great aunt or some other member of my family. So, A Covenant With Death couldn't be that bad to be that loved up and tattered. Right? This tattered book by a long forgotten author named Stephen Becker was a treasure in a pile of trash books. The writing is solid and, even when it becomes long-winded, beautifully written. A parallel story of murder, love, lust, justice and injustice in the Southwestern United States in the ripe old year of 1923.Take your time and savor Stephen Becker's words because he has a lot to say. There are some real quotable gems in A Covenant With Death.

The setting of this story is 1920s .. a small town called Soledad in an unnamed state.Ben Lewis is a very young judge, appointed more because of the friendship of the governor with Ben's deceased father. When a young woman is strangled in her home and her husband is accused of the crime, he has to face his own demons and how he interprets the law.This one did not punch any of my buttons. It was a murder mystery, but there was little suspense. It is very wordy ... I felt more like I was in a schoolroom learning the lesson of the day, rather than enmeshed in a very good story. There are several characters that did catch my eye. Ben is emotionally caught between two women and it's interesting to see how he relates to them and the world, in general. The young woman who was murdered was actually more fascinating after her death. Her husband, who plays a pivotal part, is seen as both guilty and innocent. Although the case looks like a slam-dunk, it really isn't.And while I wasn't invested in the story, I think there are many who would find it a captivating look at a courtroom drama.My thanks to Open Road Integrated Media and NetGalley who furnished a digital copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Wanda Maynard", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1661386-wanda-maynard", "userReview": "A COVENANT WITH DEATH is a remarkable, deep and entertaining book, with a non-stop plot that will convey the reader into a better understanding of how justice is carried out. The paragraph about death and it\u2019s inevitability, on page 136 really had my brain in a quandary, when Ben, asked, \u201cHow can they feel the beat of their own hearts and still kill?\u201d And on page 146 where he was talking with his mother about what a race we are, and a miracle, that our organs work.

I love to read books written by men about men... they are so much more authentic than books about men written by women or vice versa. This has the same flavor that \"A Prayer for Owen Meany\" had.The plot revolves around a small town beauty's murder, but goes so much deeper with moral dilemmas, small town gossip and politics with small town, bigger than life characters, and a generous sprinkling of young man ponderings from an old man's mind. Those shoulda-beens and why-nots play a big role in how the author draws the reader into this swirl of characters.This is also classic because the characters are truly and delicately developed. The reader knows as muc about the Ben Lewis as his mother, his mentor, his neighbors, and the characters suspected of the murder. In fact, the murderer is no real surprise at the end. But that is not the objective of this book. The objective is how a small town copes with something so shocking as one of their own being murdered and her husband being accused. It also delves deeply into race relations, prohibition, and intimate relationships all from a young man's perspective. The only reason I gave it four stars instead of five stars is because it was very wordy in parts, and at time too introspective that did not move the story along. But then, that was the kind of story people liked to read in 1964.DescriptionA riveting tale of love and death in a small New Mexico town that ranks alongside Anatomy of a Murder and To Kill A Mockingbird as one of the twentieth century\u2019s most captivating courtroom dramasOn a sultry day in the spring of 1923, Louise Talbot spends the last afternoon of her life lounging in the shade of a sycamore tree in her front yard. Beautiful and vivacious, Louise is the talk of Soledad City\u2014every man lusts after her; every woman wants to know her secrets. She is found strangled to death that evening, and when the investigation uncovers her affair with another man, the citizens of the frontier town draw the obvious conclusion: Bryan Talbot murdered his wife in a fit of jealousy and rage.Presiding over the trial is twenty-nine-year-old Ben Lewis. Appointed to the bench as a tribute to the memory of his late father, he fears he is too inexperienced to sentence another man to death. All the evidence points to Talbot, however, and it is a magistrate\u2019s sworn duty to see that justice is served. But when a last-second twist casts the question of the defendant\u2019s guilt or innocence in a shocking new light, Judge Lewis must decide whether to uphold the law\u2014or let a murderer go free.A thrilling suspense story and a fascinating inquiry into human nature and the true meaning of justice, A Covenant with Death was a New York Times bestseller and the basis for a feature film starring George Maharis and Gene Hackman.Received from Netgalley for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7092147-nancy", "userReview": "Love, Death, and the LawBen Lewis is young for a judge. He was appointed by the governor as a favor to his dead father. Sometimes he doubts his ability as a judge and facing the most important trial of his career others do also. The trial concerns the murder of a beautiful woman. Her husband, who was drunk at the time, found her and immediately became the chief suspect. The case seems open and shut, but is it? Ben has his own romantic problems being caught between two women, a desirable Swedish girl, and a sultry Mexican heiress. As Ben struggles with the trial and his personal demons, he faces the truth about himself and the law. A Covenant with Death is more than a murder mystery, it's a psychological exploration of the meaning of life and the relation of law to society. The novel takes place in an unnamed Southwestern county in 1923. The atmosphere of heat and sand is a perfect backdrop for the ensuing action. I thought the author did an excellent job showing how the town's people react during the complex case. Ben's character is well done. Although I often dislike books where the main character does a lot of soul searching, in this instance it was compelling. I also loved the character of his mother. I highly recommend this book if you enjoy a good murder mystery, but even more if you're interested in truth, innocence, and the limits of the law.

I had no idea what I was getting into when I began reading the copy of A Covenant with Death, provided by the publishers, except to note that it was a reissue of a novel by a popular 20th century author, Stephen Becker. Imagine my surprise when I found it to be a profound meditation on the nature of justice and of capital punishment in the guise of a courtroom procedural.It is summer 1923, and a small town in New Mexico is rocked by the murder of a young housewife, Louise Talbot. She lives in the same block as Ben Lewis, a 28-year-old, who has just been chosen by the governor of New Mexico to be a circuit court judge. The governor owed his life to Ben's father, and out of respect, gives the honor of a judgeship to his son, a recent law school graduate.Of course, Louise's husband is suspected immediately of her death and is arraigned for the murder. An older circuit court judge takes the case, and Ben attends the court sessions to learn what he can about courtroom routines. However, Ben has a lot of things on his mind. He is living with his widowed mother, which for the most part goes well, but he also has a lot of romance problems that his mother keeps trying to solve. We only know the case and the trial from Ben's point of view, and his view is clouded by his worries that he is not worthy of being a judge and his ability to dispense justice, when he is so young and untried. A shocking event occurs just when the older judge is going on vacation, and Ben is now faced with a life or death situation on which he must rule. As we read his actions and his musings, we see him mature into a fine judge who is able to understand the nature of justice and dispense a decision that is awe inspiring.One reviewer says that A Covenant with Death is \"one of the finest fictional explorations of the nature of justice in the history of American literature.\" Others compare it to Anatomy of a Murder and To Kill a Mockingbird as an outstanding courtroom drama. On the other hand, it is much more than a courtroom drama. It is also the depiction life in a small New Mexico town, which adds greatly to the storytelling. Most tellingly, it relates a young man's journey into maturity and responsibility. That, to me, was one of the most magnificent parts of the novel\u2014how Ben's understanding of justice matures when he is faced with dispensing life-or-death justice. Stephen Becker died in 1999 after a long career as an author, translator, and professor of English. He concentrated on the \"moral and social complexities of law and justice. In his books, the rigidity and absoluteness of law collides with human values\u2014especially the need for expiation, mercy and compassion.\" (in Gale Contemporary Authors). Frankly, I was so pleased to happen upon this book. It is definitely one of the best books I have read in a long time. A Covenant with Death is only available for download. There will be no hard copy in this reissue.There is a movie version that was released in 1967. Many of the movie reviews, however, say that the book was much better than the movie. I think that I just want to savor the memory of this outstanding novel, and not bother my brain with an inferior movie."}, {"userName": "Shane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4689033-shane", "userReview": "disclaimer \u2013 i received a copy of this book via open road integrated media in exchange for an honest review.in 1923, the lovely and highly desired louise talbot is brutally murdered. when it\u2019s discovered that she was having an affair, her husband is charged with the crime. the trial and its aftermath rocks the tiny town of soledad city and forever changes the lives of all its residents.a covenant with death was originally published in 1964 and this is its well deserved re-emergence. it\u2019s clear from the beginning that ben lewis, one of the town\u2019s two magistrates, is an unreliable narrator. he was naive when the events took place and he\u2019s looking back with insight gained through a lifetime of experience.when you know that the narrator is unreliable you have to ask yourself, \u201ccan i believe anything he says, even with the added benefit of experience?\u201d in a covenant with death what you\u2019re actually hearing is a story that was observed and lived by one version of a man, processed by another version of him, and finally reconstructed and told by a third. like playing the children\u2019s game \u201ctelephone\u201d you know that details, perhaps crucial ones, will be altered, perhaps irrevocably, from their original version.author stephen becker has crafted a narrator who can rise above this handicap. each time ben lewis steps out of the narration to weave his current life into it should jar the reader out of the story. instead, it pulls you further and further into the story, not only because of the murder and the trial and the people, but because he is as compelling a character in the context of the original story as he is fascinating a character in his own right.there is a lot of time period specific language in the story, but the meaning is clear in the given context. there are sections that are incredibly verbose but, given the time period (1923), the language makes sense and doesn\u2019t draw you out of the story. i\u2019m sorry that it took me so long to find out about this story because it is a fascinating character study and intriguing foray into the 1920\u2019s legal system.five out of five stars"}, {"userName": "Schuyler Wallace", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1140776-schuyler-wallace", "userReview": "Stephen Becker (1927-1999) has the legacy of a great writer and being \u201can extraordinary man,\u201d according to John Cheever in his letters. \u201cA Covenant of Death\u201d is one of those books that restore a reader\u2019s faith in good fiction, entertaining and written with great skill.

His characterizations are carefully honed with each participant being clearly defined with qualities that are essential to the story. Becker contracted Guillain-Barre syndrome when he was 32 and was unable to walk. Most of his life after that was spent in a wheelchair.
