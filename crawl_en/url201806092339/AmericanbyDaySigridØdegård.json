In this outing Sigrid comes to Jefferson County in search of her brother, at the request of her father. She finds her brother wanted by the police in the mysterious death of a black woman. She meets Irving Wiley, former divinity student, now elected Sheriff of the County where the death occurred. She also gets a first hand look at race relations and other oddities of a country that shares little with her home country of Norway.I love this author's writing style, amusing at times, witty, but incredibly insightful. His characters are well rounded, very different people, and Wiley is one of the best new characters invented in my many reads. He is honest, can quote scripture with the best of them and can be impassioned in his arguments, but he is also able to balance his communities needs, finding novel ways to tamper down tensions. Using Sigrid, the author shows us the many ways Norway differs from the USA., Showing us how little some of the things happening here make little sense. I liked this aspect of the novel, but can see where some readers might not. Sigrid herself is loyal, clever, and not above voicing her opinion.This a a great mix of story and character. Will appeal to those who do not like mysteries, simply because this is so much more. It is also character driven and somewhat of a social commentary. This is an author I have come to love, all three of his books for me have been fantastic reading experiences.Can't wait to see where he takes us next.ARC from Netgalley."}, {"userName": "Paromjit", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38610813-paromjit", "userReview": "Derek B. Miller uses the crime/thriller format to deliver a smart literary state of the nation perspective on the US and compares it with Norway, on issues of policing, race, women, power, politics, society and the individual. He makes astute and incisive observations on burning contemporary issues in the US with wry humour and comic wit. Sigrid Odegard, arrives in Upstate New York and Jefferson County in her search for her brother, Marcus, at the urging of her father who feels something is wrong. She brings her Norwegian outsider's eye in her thoughts and opinions on the weird US. She finds Marcus has disappeared and is wanted after his presence at the scene of the death of the black Professor Lydia Jones with whom he had been in relationship with. Was it suicide or murder? Lydia's nephew, young Jeffrey Simmons had recently been shot dead by the police, traumatising the entire family and the black community, particularly after justice had been denied with the officer concerned judged to have no case to answer regarding the black child killing.Sigrid finds herself working with and against the elected eccentric Sheriff Irving Wylie, a trained theologian, who finds himself challenged by Sigrid who identifies their differing approaches to cases. She sees an investigation as an iterative process of hypothetic-deductive reasoning, seeing facts not as evidence, facts become evidence when they are mobilised in support of an argument. This exploratory approach requires a degree of comfort with ambiguity. There is a look at the state of mental health, depression and suicide in the US, the figures for women in policing and Deputy Melinda Powell sees Sigrid as a powerful female police role model. Sigrid and Irv's relationship flowers with both being strong, intelligent characters, it has Irv going the extra mile to ensure that Marcus is not shot dead by a trigger happy law enforcement community and protecting Sigrid when her actions veer towards the outrageous. This story takes in white supremacist bikers, heightened community tensions, the grief of Lydia's family and the problematic relations between the police and the black community, and a hunt for Marcus in the Adirondacks that results in the use of Molotov cocktails.Miller's novel is a joy to read, and his thinking on the state of the US delivered through Sigrid and Irving is both erudite and compelling. I particularly liked how perceptions, how things look matters more and politically self interested decisionmaking trumps any judicious investigations. In a conflicted US, and the differences between Sigrid and Irv, these resolved on an individual basis with their connection with each other on a personal level. It is this micro level focus on individuals relating to and connecting with each other, providing some possible answers towards solving what would otherwise be insurmountable global, national, political, cultural, racial divisions and more, that results in dividing people. This is an exciting and engaging read, written by an author who transcends the crime genre to give us a brilliant thought provoking novel that I recommend highly. I absolutely adored the offbeat characters he creates and his thoughtful and witty approach to story telling.

Derek Miller is a brilliant writer and storyteller, and for that alone I would recommend this book. But that is only part of the reason I loved this book. I appreciate hearing reasoned opinions and ideas about social and political issues in the US from non-US residents, and the observations and commentary of Miller were revealing and insightful, particularly about institutional racism, economic inequality, the proliferation of guns and the lack of reasonable gun control laws, and misconceptions about what constitutes freedom. In addition, Miller perfectly leavens dark drama with dry wit and very funny comments and conversations. (Now I know one of the reasons some men wear cowboy boots!) The characters are believable and deeply developed and I found myself wanting to spend time with them. I highly recommend \u201cAmerican by Day\u201d and though it can easily be read as a stand-alone, I strongly encourage reading the first book in the series \u201cNorwegian by Night\u201d because it\u2019s just as exceptional.Thank you to Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and NetGalley for providing an advance copy of this book in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "I read a lot of mystery/thrillers and occasionally one comes along which is really superior to the rest. American by Day is one of those.Author Derek B. Miller had a moment of genius when he decided to bring the main character of Norwegian by Night, Sigrid Odegard, out of her native Norway and into the backwoods of the Adirondacks, USA. Here she is thrown into the company of Irving Wylie, a man with a masters degree in Divinity who is now the local Sheriff. This is a character driven book and these two together are wonderful. They are both smart and their attempts to outdo each other create a lot of humorous moments.American by Day has so much in it. There are some great lines when Sigrid in particular is comparing Norway with America. There is commentary on the situation of African-Americans and on American policing. There is even a little bit of the history of politics concerning events in 2008 and Obama\u2019s race to the White House.I found this book to be an absolute delight and it is one I intend to keep on my shelves to read again in the future."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19559507-carolyn", "userReview": "In this follow-up to Norwegian by Night, Miller takes on a journey to middle America as seen through Norwegian eyes and the resulting picture is just as full of quirky characters and situations as in his previous novel.Sigrid \u00d8deg\u00e5rd was hoping to spend time recovering from the events at the close of the previous novel, visiting her father\u2019s farm, but instead her father sends her off to America to find her missing brother, Marcus. When she arrives in the small New York college town where Marcus has been teaching she finds that he disappeared after the death of his lover, college professor Lydia Jones and is now wanted by the local Sheriff, cowboy boot wearing Irving Wylie, in connection with her death.As a Norwegian, Sigrid is able to look at America with outsider\u2019s eyes and see the weirdness that has been allowed to develop. A country where gun ownership is valued more than people\u2019s lives, where a child can be shot by a police officer while playing with his friends without recrimination and where racial inequality still thrives. Through her wry observation and logic, Sigrid is able to point out these differences without causing offense. For example, Sigrid is discussing the number of police killed by guns (a rare event in Norway) with Melinda, a young female officer in awe of Sigrid:\u201dWe actually do have a lot of guns. There\u2019s a lot of hunting in Norway. But there\u2019s almost no gun violence.\u201d\u201cWhy do you think that is?\u201d\u201cOn a fundamental level,\u201d says Sigrid, \u201cI think it\u2019s because we don\u2019t want to shoot each other.\u201dSigrid is also fascinated by the American system of voting Sheriffs into office and the influence that politics and politicians, rather than justice, can have on policing. Sheriff Wallace (\u2018Irv\u2019) is fascinating to her in his cowboy boots and laid back manner that camouflage his sharp wit and intelligence. Irv is also fascinated by Sigrid, as there are few female cops in the higher ranks in the US, particularly in small towns. Together they make a fine partnership of contrasting styles as they go off in search of Marcus. The novel is full of quirky and inventive scenes, mostly of Sigrid\u2019s making (such as her interactions with the local bikie gang and later the special response team sent to arrest Marcus) and is a joy to read from start to finish. In American by Day Miller has written an excellent literary thriller, on a par with the superb Norwegian by Night. 5++\u2605With thanks to Netgalley and Houghton Mifflin Harcourt for a copy of the book to read"}, {"userName": "\u262eKaren", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen", "userReview": "Oh, Derek B. Miller, it's good to know you've still got it, that incredible ability to take serious, tough topics like suicide, cancer, depression, grief and loneliness, politics and prejudice, and put them into a story that is deep, yes, but lots of fun too. Loved it! I adored Norwegian By Night (5 stars too), so this sequel had a lot of expectations to live up to; and it managed to make me feel happy, sad, and even a little more intelligent because Miller's writing covers some heavy topics that make you really think. These are all the same feelings I had with NBN, so this book met and surpassed my expectations.We get to know Sigrid Odegard much better here, and the New York sheriff Irving Wylie who is trying to help her find her brother is a wonderful character. Miller creates lonely, quirky souls who worm their way into your very heart.In this town in upstate New York, an African American boy named Jeffrey was shot by a policeman who believed Jeffrey's toy gun was real. The cop was exonerated. His Aunt Lydia is dating Sigrid's brother Marcus, and Lydia is soon found dead outside a construction site, having fallen 6 floors. Whether she was pushed by Marcus, now missing, and if there was any connection between the two deaths is what Sheriff Wylie wants to know; and Sigrid intends to find her brother before the authorities do. She is much more wiley than Sheriff Wylie, but quite a pair they do make.

Anyone who has had the pleasure of reading the first novel will remember Norwegian Chief Inspector Sigrid Odegard \u2013 and those who haven\u2019t read it will quickly get acquainted with her.Here she finds herself swiftly transported to America in search of her missing brother, who is a suspect in the death of his African-American girlfriend Lydia, an acclaimed professor with a heavy heart. She teams up with the local sheriff, Irving Wylie, surely one of the more delightful sheriffs of literature, with a dry wit, a kind heart, a pragmatic mind, and a keen insight into the politics of justice.There is much in this novel to enjoy. The banter between Sigrid and Irving is spot-on and there are laugh out loud moments as the two cultures clash. Derek B. Miller also provides some real food for thought about our gun culture and institutionalized racism without crossing the line and becoming pedantic. Take this, for example: \u201c\u2026it\u2019s deeper than race. It\u2019s deeper than politics It\u2019s a culturally organizing system. It\u2019s how we achieve Americanness. It\u2019s how we do Americanness. It\u2019s a kind of performance.\u201d Miller \u2013 and by extension, his characters \u2013 believe that the American passion for individualism stand in the way of community achievement.I was a little wary that all this would be too heavy-handed but Derek B. Miller strikes just the right tone with a smart novel that engages and entertains as well as gently teaches. There are a few times he overreaches and the ending is a bit too cinematic and tied-together for my tastes. Still, this comparison of Norwegian and American mores and values and his damaged but good-spirited characters really won me over.

But I was interested in the idea that it was about a periphery character in the first novel, one I didn't like all that much, the female Norwegian cop, but focusing on her journey to upstate New York to try to find her brother. It's lucky she did because he is a suspect in a murder case and people are closing in. (Also lucky because he is an adjunct professor and could never afford to defend himself.)I liked her personal journey, questioning herself about the man she shot and killed, which of course in Norway is hugely rare. I liked the discussions about police shootings in the United States but it all had a distasteful tinge of white people sitting around talking about race instead of actually including anyone they're talking about (except as victims of shootings) so ... I am not sure that is helping anything. There's some in here about mental health and privilege too. If this series continues I'm guessing the American sheriff might be the next main character, as he has some complexities to him, such as wearing cowboy boots so people make the wrong assumptions, but really he has degrees in theology and other things like that. The setting is ripe for more stories, a small upstate town with no major industry anymore, lots of poverty and drugs. It would be nice to see this play out through characters who actually live there rather than these random Norwegians that the author keeps wanting to write about. Thanks to NetGalley for providing an eARC; this book came out April 3 and I'm a bit behind."}, {"userName": "Paul Lockman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53495766-paul-lockman", "userReview": "4.5 stars rounded up.Derek B. Miller has quickly become a favourite author of mine and American by Day didn\u2019t disappoint, though I didn\u2019t enjoy it quite as much as Norwegian by Night, one of my absolute favourite reads of 2017.Straight up I think we should warn our Goodreads friends from the USA that throughout this book he takes the piss out of American culture quite a lot. A hell of a lot actually. Some of it is light-hearted e.g. lousy coffee, terrible take away food, but a lot of it is pretty serious stuff. Institutionalised racism, the excessive use of firearms along with unnecessary and unjust police shootings and the excessive focus on the individual and individualism all come in for some biting and at times scathing criticism and the country is often depicted as downright weird. So don\u2019t say you weren\u2019t warned.Whilst he is an American citizen and presumably has spent a decent chunk of his life living in the US, Derek B. Miller is married to a Norwegian woman and currently lives in Oslo, Norway. To me, his cross-cultural experience is one of the main influences behind many of the characters and the plot in both books. No doubt his PhD in International Relations and experience in international policy contributes too.Chief Police Inspector Sigrid \u00d8deg\u00e5rd has to leave Norway for the land of the free, that great country across the Atlantic, America, to search for her missing brother Marcus who is implicated in the strange death of Lydia, an African-American academic with whom he had been in a relationship. Sigrid arrives in upstate New York and has to befriend the local police, led by Sheriff Irv Wylie, and the local police seem to have made up their minds about what happened to Lydia and what should happen to Marcus. Some months prior to her death, Lydia had lost her young nephew Jeffrey, the victim of a senseless police shooting by officer Roy Carman, and she was absolutely devastated. Not long before leaving Norway for the USA, Sigrid had shot and killed an offender, an extremely rare thing for a Norwegian police officer to have done so she is battling her own mental demons about police shootings. The relationship and the banter between Irv and Sigrid plays a major part in the book and here is an excerpt of them talking about gun control, crime rates and police shootings.\u201cThere is a war on the police out there, Sigrid. America is an armed country and we have hardened criminals. Personally, I\u2019m in favour of gun control because I think the opposite of gun control is gun out-of-control and that seems wildly irresponsible. However, all that\u2019s immaterial because\u2026there are lots of guns out there. Which means we\u2019re sworn to serve and protect in a gun-rich environment that makes our jobs scarier. And we\u2019re legitimately scared. Anybody would be.\u201d...............\u201cThere is no war on the police in America,\u201d Sigrid says. \u201cI recently read an article on this. While we don\u2019t know how many citizens are killed by the police, we do know how many cops have been killed by criminals. For one thing, the overall number of murdered officers has been dropping in a nice flattening curve since the 1970s. In fact, the last time there was a war on the police was in the 1920s during Prohibition. What\u2019s also interesting is that since the 1970s, there has been a growing number of officers. It\u2019s almost double what it was then. That means, if you do the math, that the absolute number has dropped and the relative number has plummeted. It is barely more risky today to be a police officer in America than it is to be a citizen in most cities. Oh, and the crime rate has been going down too. America is safer than ever. But according to the media, the country is doomed. The fact is, Irving, the war on the police is a fabricated lie supported by a misperception. That fabricated lie is complicit in the murder of Jeffrey, because it planted a false idea in the head of the cop with the gun. It\u2019s the same idea that puts my brother at risk.\u201dIrv then asks Sigrid why she\u2019s so angry about it\u2026......\u201cI\u2019ve stood in that moment between Jeffery and Roy,\u201d says Sigrid. It wasn\u2019t the same but it was close enough that I can see it vividly. Despite being cleared by my department, I am not convinced that I needed to kill Burim because I\u2019m not sure he was really planning to hurt me. I\u2019m not even sure that he was conscious at all. The men inside were hardened criminals, and that went as it had to. But outside, on the grass, in front of my car, I could have done more. I could have looked with different eyes. I could have seen more. I could have understood it differently. And if I had, I could have saved his life rather than ended it. I\u2019m no Roy Carman. I\u2019m not guilty of the racially motivated murder of a child. But I\u2019m responsible. I just can\u2019t figure out for what. I don\u2019t think I ever learned a vocabulary for it. In any language. It\u2019s possible,\u201c she says, \u201cthat figuring this out is the next big thing that needs to happen. Not only for me, but for everyone.\u201dThe dialogue between Irv and Sigrid does get a bit highbrow at times, stretching credibility a little that two police officers could be so articulate and smart but they are depicted as university educated, highly intelligent people so I cut the author some slack there because it was often witty and made for interesting reading. To give an example, in this scene Sigrid has concerns that Irv and his staff have already decided what\u2019s happened and she\u2019s keen to get enough time as possible to work out why her brother has disappeared after Lydia\u2019s death\u2026.....\u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about here, Irv,\u201d says Sigrid, crossing a leg, \u201cis that you have a very specific idea about what happened and now you\u2019re working your way backwards toward proving it. It\u2019s harder to be proved wrong that way, and investigators have a tendency for theory fixation.\u201d\u201cI like it when you talk shop like this,\u201d Irv says.\u201cThis is what I can talk about best in English.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s hardest for you to talk about in English?\u201d\u201cI couldn\u2019t say.\u201d\u201cWell played.\u201d\u201cWhat I try to emphasise at home, with my staff,\u201d Sigrid says, \u201cis how to take an exploratory approach rather than building a formal hypothesis, testing it, and reformulating it with findings. Investigation shouldn\u2019t be an experimental science, both because it\u2019s the wrong approach and also because cops aren\u2019t scientists trained at falsifying claims. In my experience, if an investigator picks a hypothesis too soon it starts to look like a convenient conclusion rather than a target for refutation. You know Charles Peirce?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d\u201cFounder of Pragmatism?\u201d\u201cSure,\u201d he lies.\u201cHe talked about the \u2018provisional entertainment of an explanatory inference.\u2019 It means we have to hold an idea loosely at first and allow new pieces of knowledge to enrich our understanding rather than sum things up too quickly and be wrong too early. It requires an open mind and a comfort with ambiguity that most cops don't have, It also requires police leadership that isn\u2019t pushing cops to close cases as soon as possible.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not the top of the food chain, Sigrid. There is a big and hungry leadership above my head that think I look like a cupcake.\u201d\u201cYou need to get us the time we need to learn and act wisely.\u201dI hope this gives you a bit of context and an idea of Derek B. Miller\u2019s writing. Whilst his novels do involve crimes, I would describe them more as sociocultural commentary as the crimes take somewhat of a back seat. I also notice this one is down as Sigrid \u00d8deg\u00e5rd #2 but I don\u2019t really think of it as a series and I also don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary to read Norwegian by Night first. But do yourself a favour and read NbN if you haven\u2019t already done so. I thought it was a blast, full of laugh out loud, absurdist, Catch-22 type humour and a great central character Sheldon Horowitz. The bar was raised very high for American by Day and I really enjoyed it but it just fell half a star short for me."}, {"userName": "Marianne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067228-marianne", "userReview": "American By Day is the second novel by award winning American-born author Derek B. Miller which features Chief Inspector Sigrid \u00d8deg\u00e5rd of the Oslo Politi. Sigrid first appears in Miller\u2019s debut novel, Norwegian By Night (another excellent read!). Readers with any intention of reading Norwegian By Night are strongly advised to do so before reading this one as there are significant spoilers for NbN in American By Day.Paternal pressures and concerns see Sigrid \u00d8deg\u00e5rd travelling to upstate New York to make contact with her suddenly-incommunicative older brother, Marcus. She discovers that Sheriff Irving Wylie is looking for him too, wanting to question Marcus about the death of his (black) lover, Professor Lydia Jones. There on the scene, Sigrid also learns that Lydia\u2019s young nephew was, weeks earlier, shot and killed by a police officer in what could have been a racially motivated attack. All this against a backdrop of the country gearing up for an election that may deliver America\u2019s first black President.How then - with a black community demanding justice for their dead, a pacifist sheriff (with a divinity degree, no less) under pressure from the county commissioner, a SWAT team, a gang of white supremacist bikers, a trigger happy SERT squad leader, a couple of Molotov cocktails and a Norwegian police chief who is certain her brother is innocent - how will this not end up in a bloodbath?Readers looking for an action-packed crime thriller are in the wrong place. Miller gives the reader a piece of literary crime that is punctuated by thought-provoking discussions between the characters as they wait. And that\u2019s realistic, even if that\u2019s the bit, all the waiting between dramatic events, that the thrillers omit. That said, there are definitely exciting bits.Miller\u2019s characters are mostly appealing, for all their flaws, and even the ones who are there to be despised are not complete stereotypes. It\u2019s difficult not to care about what happens to these people, and Irving is likely to be a favourite. He continues to surprise throughout the story, and his speech to the black congregation is wonderful. Miller gives his characters opinions on a myriad of issues, both topical and perennial: politicians and election campaigns; guns and gun crime; institutionalised racism; the pressure to be seen to be taking action; sadness and depression; individualism vs cooperation; fatal police shootings. The debate is usually balanced, always intelligent, and yes, sometimes the characters get a bit preachy, as people do on any controversial issue about which they are passionate.As with Norwegian By Night, this novel features a protagonist who is a stranger in a strange land. Sheldon could speak no Norwegian. Sigrid speaks good English, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean she fully understands all that is being said, or can always make her own meaning clear. And America, she has decided, is definitely a weird place. Her observations about America are insightful and often amusing.The characters\u2019 dialogue and their inner monologues are consistent sources of humour. It is sometimes subtle, often dry, occasionally tongue-in-cheek and at times, very dark, but Miller gives the reader plenty of laugh out loud moments. He also treats the reader to some marvellous descriptive prose: \u201cShe fires up the bus, which rumbles to life with the enthusiasm of an old man passing gas. The hydraulic doors seem to suck the passengers inside; like a giant vacuum it clears the platform and removes all traces of humanity except the lingering smell.\u201dRather than being numbered, the chapters are meaningfully titled from the text. Enclosed within an evocative Hopper Nighthawks-esque cover, this funny, moving and thought-provoking novel is a brilliant sequel to Norwegian By Night.

Miller follows up his highly successful debut with a touch of class, in this brilliant thriller with a nod to Scandi Noir, American By Day. The prose flows like water and is as smooth as silk, this could easily be placed amongst literary thrillers as it crosses both genres easily and at no time do you feel being preached at.While we must work out whodunnit, we are given a psychological study of small town American policing, boarding on the paramilitary. While asking how a white police officer can shoot a child who is playing with his friends and then not be brought up on a charge. Drilling down into how united the United States really is when there are clear dividing lines between rich and poor, black and white. This is a book reflecting on society while there is a story of two foreigners out of their depth.Chief Inspector Sigrid \u00d8deg\u00e5rd is taking a well-deserved holiday, especially after recent events, when she had to shoot an offender. She needs to rest and get herself back together and the best place for that is her father\u2019s farm in Northern Norway. When she gets there, she finds her father is worried about her older brother, Markus, who has gone missing. He wants Sigrid to find him and has bought a flight ticket to America to find him.When Sigrid eventually arrives at Markus\u2019 house he is long gone and needs to find the local sheriff, which she does. Sheriff Irving Wylie, could have come straight from central casting, a god fearing, cowboy boot wearing, sheriff to serve Jefferson County, New York. Both are suspicious of each other and their motives in Marcus\u2019 case. To Americans he is a wanted murderer, who should be shot on site, to Sigrid he is her brother and there may be more to this than meets the eye.Eventually a strange partnership between Irv and Sigrid, seems to work the case, while respecting each other. Irv who is trying to control the forces that wish to crack a nut with a sledgehammer while recognising this will not actually solve anything.This is a brilliant book as you look at the American psyche during the 2008 election and the dividing lines in American life. With touches of comedy relieving the tension and aimed at the right characters just simply adds to the story. This is simply a crime story you will want everyone to read and enjoy, while opening their minds, and sometimes not charging in like a bull in a china shop really is the best option."}, {"userName": "Mary Lins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14389832-mary-lins", "userReview": "I absolutely loved Derek B.

Seen through a stranger's eyes, this proves to be apt! In America Sigrid meets Sheriff Irving (Irv) Wylie, and I fell in love with him immediately. He reminded me so much of various Richard Russo characters I've loved (this is HIGH praise from me - I'm a super-fan of Russo's). Several times I literally (yes, I know the definition) laughed out loud when reading conversations between Irv and Sigrid. Witty, wise, and smart banter between characters is just one of Miller's many talents as a gifted writer.This is a \"fish out of water\" story at its best. Sheldon, the American protagonist of \"Norwegian by Night\" was a \"fish out of water\" in Norway. As indicated in the title, \"American by Day\" flips the story to Sigrid. This allows Miller to take us through some heavy stuff. It's not just the dramatically different ways that cops in the US look for evidence and investigate crime; Miller also weighs in on America's fraught relationships with race, guns, and our individualistic culture. It's quite thought-provoking, whether you agree with his hypotheses (via Sigrid and Irv), or not. These passages are part of what makes this novel a terrific candidate for a thoughtful - and uncomfortable - book club discussion.Interestingly, \"American by Day\" is dedicated: \"For Sheldon\". I wonder if there is a real Sheldon in Miller's life, or if he's referring to his character? Or both! While Sheldon is not an active character in \"American by Day\", Sigrid often \"channels\" him in a sort of \"what would Sheldon do?\" kind of way. (Another reason to read \"Norwegian by Night\"!)If I could give this book 10 stars, I would. It will, without a doubt, be on my Top Ten list for 2018, and I'll be purchasing copies for gifts. Now, I just have to try to wait patiently for Miller's next novel! I hope he's already on it!"}, {"userName": "Bonnie Brody", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630898-bonnie-brody", "userReview": "This wonderful novel opens in Norway as Sigrid returns to visit her father, Morten, who runs a small farm. Her father shares his concerns about Sigrid's brother Marcus, who has been in the United States for many years. He suffered greatly as a child when his mother died and appeared to pull far away from his father and even Sigrid, with whom he'd once been very close. Marcus had been writing to Morten but the letters stopped and the last letter was puzzling and of deep concern. The final sentences of Marcus's last letter to his father states \"What I now understand is that it was my fault. And also yours. But you, I forgive.\"Sigrid is a Chief Inspector in the Norwegian police department and Morton wants her to travel to upstate New York, where Marcus lives, and bring him home. Marcus has been implicated in the death of a woman and both Morton and Sigrid feel sure he wouldn't have hurt anyone.As Sigrid debarks in the United States she repeatedly notices how weird this country is and constantly experiences culture shock She meets Irving Wylie, the Sheriff in charge of the case, and requests that she be able to participate in the search for her brother. The interactions between Sigrid and Irving make up for some of the best parts of this novel. Irving, an elected sheriff, has a master's degree in theology and his take on the world is very different that one would expect from a small town sheriff. Sigrid is battling her own demons. Just prior to leaving Norway, she was involved in a case where she felt impelled to shoot a criminal. Living with the fact that she shot a man eats at her and she perseverates on whether there was another choice, if she did the right thing in taking a life.This novel examines not only the differences between Norwegian and American culture, but explores issues of racism, socioeconomic differences, and ways that people can meet one another on common ground despite differences. The writing is excellent, sometimes tongue in cheek, and the book kept my interest to the last page.

Miller book to read\u2014the one that preceded this one, NORWEGIAN BY NIGHT, featuring forty year-old section chief Sigrid \u00d8deg\u00e5rd of the Oslo police department. Both novels take place in 2008, but of crimes that are entirely different. Miller\u2019s last novel, THE GIRL IN GREEN, was one of my favorites of 2017, as he transports us to the Middle East during wartime 1991 and then 22 years later, focusing more on the perception, influence, and insanity (and sometimes inanity) of the media. Miller has a knack for juxtaposing the horrific with the absurdist, which in turn makes the story even more poignant. AMERICA BY DAY focuses on a police investigation, and again, like a dart, he targets perception vs. the truth. In this case, saliency with high profile cases that involve race in America, and then contrasts it with the Norwegian approach of catching a criminal. But, there\u2019s also a universal link to police instincts in crises that turns a bit of the contrasting theories on their heads. Sigrid is compelled by her father to go to the US, specifically, upstate NY, to locate her possibly missing older brother, Marcus, an adjunct professor that has been teaching there for the past 20 or so years. Sigrid is plagued by events that have distanced her and Marcus from each other. She also just went through a stressful event on the job, and longs for some time away from work.Sigrid\u2019s arrival in the US is so spot-on\u2014her absorption of American manners, culture, and procedures is so observant, witty, and thoughtful that I was reminded that I am in the hands of a writer that sees the world with subtly acute and intelligent eyes. She is thrown together with the philosophical sheriff Irv Wylie, with a background and master\u2019s degree in Divinity. Rather than narrowing his focus on religion, his studies has given him a savvy skill set for understanding human behavior, and the ability to pierce the pernicious side of institutional conduct and racism that he is forced to withstand. Together, these two provide the reader with the wittiest clash-of- cultures banter you can hope for. On approaching crime-solving, Sigrid points out that Americans tend to quickly create a hypothesis and then work their way back to prove it, whereas her approach is slower, more exploratory, without presumption, and based on evidentiary facts. It is only when these are collated that you can connect the dots. In her estimation, doing things right is what speeds things up. As Irv notes, \u2026\u201dit\u2019s most true when people care about the results. Usually they don\u2019t, though. They care about perception, and it\u2019s easier to perceive something in motion, and fast is more exciting than slow\u2026 They want conclusions that make them look good.\u201dMiller commands this page-turning narrative with both open generosity and restraint. He allows his characters to win us over with their resilience, flaws, vulnerability, and humor, but the author doesn\u2019t impose any political or social views of his own. In fact, he steers clear of giving us pat answers and instead we feel the burden of doubt and incertitude to any system, community, or institutional philosophy. Irv understands that the American culture of individualism embraces performance, to a fault, and the quest for achievement can be blind to justice for all. And Sigrid learns that uncertainty has its place, and stepping blind into the fray has a nervy legitimacy, too. What the reader comes away with is an exuberance and optimism for the human spirit."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16761562-sue", "userReview": "The Scandi cop and the cowboy-booted sheriff.This is the follow-up story to Derek B. Miller\u2019s wondrous debut Norwegian by Night which should be read first to gain maximum enjoyment from this one. Sigrid \u00d8deg\u00e5rd is an efficient 40-year old Norwegian cop on extended leave from her senior post after a police operation ended in debacle. Her older brother Marcus, a depressive, has lived in upstate New York for many years. When Marcus\u2019s letters dry up, their long-widowed father is so concerned that he buys Sigrid a plane ticket to the States to investigate his son\u2019s disappearance.Sheriff Irving Wylie (\u201cIrv\u201d) is the local voted-into-office police chief, a Republican, a Divinity scholar, a good man and a wise one (notwithstanding the fact that he wears cowboy boots). He is also looking for Sigrid\u2019s brother, in connection with the fatality of a prominent black college lecturer with whom Marcus had been in a relationship. The mis-matching of two police investigators is a familiar trope in American movies but here it has the added frisson \u2013 nicely underplayed \u2013 of attraction. Miller treats us to lots of smart US-style dialogue and although some of it may sound less than convincing coming, as it does, from the mouth of a Norwegian cop, I\u2019m prepared to waive my reservations as I enjoyed Sigrid\u2019s scenes with Irv so much. Ditto the interaction with Melissa, the young new rookie cop.Deeper points are made \u2013 this is a Derek B. Miller book, after all \u2013 about racial tensions in America, politically-pressurised policing, the enlightened acceptance of female cops in Norway compared to America (particularly in positions of seniority), the value of the church in the community, the stance on gun-ownership between the two countries and the huge disparity between their gun violence statistics. This is both fascinating and timely. The dazzling and genre-defying Norwegian by Night is a tough act to follow. But this quote from Sigrid towards the end of the book will give you something of the flavour and humour of this very enjoyable spin-off: \u201cShe is angry at men. All men. For their stupidity, their lies, their egotism, their irrelevant words, their aggressive personalities and hairy backs. She is angry at them for what they did and didn\u2019t do. For what they say and leave unsaid. For the timber of their voices and the length of their strides, the ease by which they open jars and their inexplicable incapacity to return even the smallest objects to their rightful locations.\u201d I'm not the only one to find men messy then.My thanks to Penguin Random House UK for the review copy courtesy of NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Sid Nuncius", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47323871-sid-nuncius", "userReview": "I thought American By Day was very good in the end. It is very well written, witty, engaging and thoughtful.Be warned that this is the sequel to Norwegian By Night and the first 50 pages or so form a very extensive spoiler, so I'd recommend reading Norwegian By Night first. In fact, I found the opening rather a struggle, with a lot of slightly unconvincing recapping and scene-setting. However, when the protagonist Sigrid arrives in the USA from Norway to find out what has happened to her brother, things really begin to take off. This is largely because of Sheriff Irv Wylie, who is an absolutely brilliant character; a Divinity scholar turned policeman he is wise, erudite and very funny. Sigrid's very Norwegian, down-to-earth analytical approach makes a great contrast, and the result is a delight.A good, engaging crime story evolves, but the real meat of this book is a thoughtful, humane but unsparing look at aspects of US society. Set in the run-up to the 2008 Presidential elections, there is some really fine analysis of race relations especially, but some shrewd observations on all sorts of other aspects of American life, too; food, gun control, the meaning of \"freedom\" and so on. There are some very familiar tropes of political interference, media misrepresentation causing serious community problems, and others, but they are handled with such insight and lack of clich\u00e9 that it all felt very fresh.American By Day developed into a very good book indeed and despite an unpromising beginning, it deserves five stars.

Hanging on the framework of a truly original storyline, Derek Miller focused on the subject of war and its consequences on succeeding generations, employing four different wars in the narrative. In American by Day, he follows that model, this time with an examination of racism. Folded into the fabric of this engrossing narrative are issues of memory, redemption, lives constructed of misunderstanding, and deepfelt love, but the real issue here is the American stain of racism. Years before the phrase Black Lives Matter, during the summer of 2008, Chief Inspector Sigrid \u00d8deg\u00e5rd (from the earlier book) travels to upper New York State to track down her brother who has disappeared into the Adirondacks for reasons that Miller reveals economically and effectively. Every character is rendered affectionately where appropriate, but there are several that don't deserve that consideration, resulting in some hilarious laugh out loud scenes. Every town should be so lucky as to have a Sheriff Irv, and his exchanges for Sigrid are spot on, as is all the dialogue.

Still recovering from her encounter with a criminal (Norwegian by Night follows the life of this criminal), her father requests her to go to America.

I loved the part of the book where Sigrid is introduced to the world of America. Her amazement at 24x7 coffee, cheaper alcoholic drinks as compared to Norway, and the general chattiness of the people of America. The parts of the book where the author has introduced the concepts of racial discrimination are very well written. It gave me a new perspective about racial discrimination. Also, the author talks about how \"normal\" books on detectives/police investigation seem to glorify the whole aspect of hunting for the guilty.

You don't have to read \"Norwegian\" to understand \"American\"; Miller does a good job in bringing the reader up to date on his first book. Both are set in the summer of 2008, that summer before the Obama/McCain election, that summer before the financial crisis. In \"Norwegian\", Miller introduced characters and a plot that were different - probably, anyway - from most literary novels. The book was a strange hybrid of literary and mystery and scored well with readers. Miller returns with \"American\", set at the same time, but different location. The United States, not Norway.One of the minor characters in the first book - Oslo Police Lt Sigrid Odegard - opens this story being officially exonerated for having killed a man in the line of duty. She returns to her childhood home to rest but leaves for the United States to track down her older brother, Marcus, who has long been estranged from Sigrid and her father. Marcus is wanted in connection with a possible murder and is hiding out in the Lake Placid area.\"Fish-out-of-water\" can be used to describe Sigrid Odegard's time in the United States. The reader looks at our country through Sigrid's Norwegian sensibilities and Miller doesn't hold back with his - fairly - gentle jibes. But Miller combines his japes with a serious look at black/white police killings and how they've affected society. While the book sounds a bit heavy handed, it really isn't.

Instead of keeping you in suspense as to my reaction to this book, I will quickly say that it has already claimed a position in my top reads of the year so far, and here\u2019s why\u2026This book reunites us with Norwegian police chief inspector Sigrid Odegard, who finds herself on a journey, both professional and personal, to track down her missing brother in upstate New York. By marrying the disparate methods of beliefs and practice of law enforcement between Odegard and her American counterpart Sheriff Irving \u2018Irv\u2019 Wylie, Miller weaves his dialogue between them with emotional punch, feisty exchanges and differences of opinion, but never losing sight of the fact that they are both are fundamentally on the same side, albeit moulded and shaped by differing social influences. The verbal sparring, but growing mutual respect, is beautifully depicted, and the frisson of tension between them never feels contrived or clich\u00e9d as is all too common in crime fiction.Odegard\u2019s character in particular carries with it a weight of self doubt, constant self appraisal and moments of vulnerability that really resonate with the reader, and she is without doubt one of the most roundly drawn, authentic, and empathetic female characters that I have encountered of late. As she grapples with the gaps in language, cultural differences, and her growing fearfulness as to her brother\u2019s fate, Miller effortlessly carries the reader on her journey of discovery and epiphany, engaging us completely as the story progresses. The dialogue throughout the book is beautifully controlled, infused with wit, gaps in understanding, and envelops the reader in the definition of the characters, their relationships, their emotions and how they perceive and seek to make sense of the world around them.By aligning these protagonists from two entirely different cultures, Miller has afforded himself the opportunity to provide a mirror to the social and racial issues that plague American society both in the timeline of 2008, with the election looming, and perhaps more pertinently how these conflicts plague American life still. One review I read of this book made a sniffy comment about Miller\u2019s didacticism, and yes, there is a strong sense of authorial comment pervading the book, which is inevitable in the time period, and with the social, racial and political issues the narrative gives rise to. However, I think any reader with a modicum of intelligence will have the gumption to embrace the author\u2019s more cerebral observations, be they objective or subjective, and process this information for themselves. Personally, I had no problem with Miller\u2019s exploration of the American psyche, the ever present issues of racial division, police brutality and so on, as I don\u2019t believe that anyone can claim ignorance as to the existence of these divisive issues. Harking back to the quote from Karin Slaughter that crime fiction is the best medium to reflect the true ills and division of society, this is the lasting impression of this book for me. I found Miller\u2019s juxtaposition of a compelling and emotive plot, with the exploration of race, violence, mental illness and social conflict a perfect blend, and his balance between the two streams of narrative are never less that completely absorbing.I think it\u2019s safe to say that a significant number of people that read, aside from the pure enjoyment of reading, do so to provide themselves with an enhanced comprehension of the world around them, and to encounter and experience people, places and cultural differences, and this is what Miller achieves here. American By Day is smarter than your average thriller, but containing all the essential components of good crime fiction that keep us reading and reading.

Her father, Morten is 69yrs old and lonely. He is estranged from his son; Marcus and we learn that this is surrounding past issues when their mother Astrid died. Marcus has never truly gotten over the death of his mother, he has blamed his father and fled to the US. Marcus seeks a better life, a fresh start, but will he find it?Over the course of the conversation between Sigrid and Morten, we learn that father and son had been in contact via letter recently. That the written communication began seven months ago and ended abruptly a week ago. Morten is concerned and urges Sigrid to investigate. When I say \u2018urges\u2019, I mean he already has her flight booked. On the journey we learn that Marcus had acquired a position at a university and had recently found love. Sigrid is an unusual character she applies rational thought and almost immediately begins compiling the \u2018data\u2019 she has surrounded her own brother. She is apprehensive about entering the USA, regarding it as a weird place. The contrast between the society and way of life in Norway and America is intriguing throughout the novel. When Sigrid arrives at Marcus\u2019s apartment she is greeted by a hooker named Juliet. She tells Sigrid that not only is Marcus missing but that local Sheriff Irving Wylie has been asking questions regarding the death of Marcus\u2019s girlfriend Lydia. Did Marcus commit murder? What kind of mess has Sigrid walked into? Can she find Marcus before the police?Alone and in a foreign country, Sigrid know she has to confront the situation with the Sheriff head on. But what she uncovers just leads to more mystery and suspicion. Sigrid often clashes with Irv about police tactics and attitudes. Especially when the case leads to the past police shooting of an unarmed African American boy named Jeffrey, who was just 12 years old. \u2018In Jefferson County alone there had been almost two dozen police shootings that had left someone dead. Eighty percent of those dead were black despite fewer than ten percent of the population being black. Everyone knew something was off, but event by event, every shooting sounded right and reasonable. But how could that be?\u2019 When Sigrid gains access to Marcus\u2019s computer files, she learns this case is so much deeper than she originally believed. The novel deals with the issue of institutionalised racism within the police force and the aftermath of trauma for the community of the murdered victim. When I read the scene of Jeffrey\u2019s death, I became as angry as Sigrid, at the injustice of it all. But can Sigrid take on the American justice system and find her brother? The novel is set in the 2008 election season and the potential of Obama as president plays out in the background. It is impossible to ignore the political, social and race themes within the novel. This is a detailed crime fiction novel, that I can see being very popular amongst readers of the genre. 4*"}, {"userName": "BOOKLOVER10", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47483579-booklover10", "userReview": "\"American by Day,\" Derek Miller's follow-up to \"Norwegian by Night,\" takes place in 2008.

When her father, Morten, asks Sigrid to travel from Oslo to America to find her missing brother, Marcus, she takes a leave of absence from her job and goes to upstate New York, where her brother had a house, teaching job, and a woman he loved, Lydia Jones. Sadly, Lydia died under mysterious circumstances, and the police are looking for Marcus to question him about his role in her death. Sigrid has an idea where Marcus might be, but if she wants to do things her way, she will have to keep local law enforcement off her back, which is no easy task.Miller has an eccentric writing style laced with sardonic humor, irony, a slowly unfolding plot, and idiosyncratic characters. The author tantalizes us with puzzling questions, but the answers are not immediately forthcoming. While we wait for clarification, Sigrid, who usually says exactly what she thinks, keeps us entertained. She meets her match in Sheriff Irving Wiley, who has a Master of Divinity degree from Loyola, and is no fool. The attractive, intelligent, and determined Sigrid fascinates him, but he is determined to prevent her from manipulating him. Irv wants Sigrid's cooperation; he tries to convince her to work together with his team if she wants to protect Marcus from harm.This \"fish out of water\" story is amusing and intriguing; Sigrid finds America's customs, culture, cuisine, and attitudes more than a little strange. However, the narrative is a bit slow-moving and sometimes heavy-handed in its exploration of feminist issues, gun violence, and race relations. Lydia, an African American, was a tenured professor who believed that the United States is nowhere near achieving racial and economic equality. Sigrid pontificates and spars verbally with Irv, whose training by Jesuits comes in handy when dealing with this highly opinionated and stubborn individual. \"American by Day\" is too talky, but the final chapters have some much-needed action scenes and a satisfactory, albeit predictable, conclusion. One of the central themes of Miller's unusual story is that open communication, generosity of spirit, and empathy are sorely needed to foster peaceful coexistence among family members, communities, and nations."}, {"userName": "Michaela", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64803852-michaela", "userReview": "\u201cAmerican by Day\u201d begins a few months after the events of \u201cNorwegian by Night\u201d. Sigrid \u00d8deg\u00e5rd, whom we met in the first book, is dealing with the results of the internal investigation of those events. Taking some time off work, she plans to spend that time with her father. Instead, he sends her on a mission to the US \u2013 her brother, who lives in upstate New York, has disappeared and Sigrid should locate him. A big theme of the novel is how a foreigner sees the US when being in that country for the first time. I was such a foreigner myself at one point, 20 years ago in my late twenties, and found many of Sigrid\u2019s observations very relatable and also amusing. She does, however, have at times an air of arrogance about her (something I noticed to be somewhat typical about Europeans), feeling that \u201cher\u201d way is superior to the \u201cUS\u201d way.One point of annoyance for me: the poor job of the editor/proofreader. I can overlook a few typos and a couple of grammatical errors, but there were too many of them, as well as a lack of proper punctuation. Other than that, it was a great book \u2013 I could have easily finished it within one day, if not for life\u2019s obligations. I enjoyed reading it and learning more about Sigrid\u2019s family history."}, {"userName": "Mainlinebooker", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/600545-mainlinebooker", "userReview": "A piercing commentary on America seen through Norwegian eyes makes this novel one of the best of the year. I found myself relishing this book, rolling each word over my tongue, tasting it, digesting it and oh so appreciating it. Take one smart ass sheriff and mix it with an erudite logical police officer (Sigrid)from Norway and you have the basis for a story that cannot fail to delight and one that you may want to read over and over. When Sigrid's brother, Marcus who is living in the US, disappears, Sigrid travels to the USA to try and find him and see what is wrong. All of the police force believe that Marcus is responsible for the death of a black female college professor with whom he was having a relationship. However, Sigrid refuses to believe this and uses her scholarly investigative capacities to try and convince the sheriff that there could be other alternatives. I suppose this could be labeled a mystery but it was such a wonderfully drawn and unconventional novel that discusses race relations(at a level I found enamoring), religion, individualism that it is so much more. If you are looking for a novel to make you think, race to get this. I bet you will not be disappointed."}], "description": "A gripping and timely\u00a0novel that follows Sigrid\u2014the dry-witted detective from Derek B.
