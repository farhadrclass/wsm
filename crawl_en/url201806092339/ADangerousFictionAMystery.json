She's terrific at what she does, and doesn't see many changes on the horizon. One night, she is accosted by a wanna-be author whose manuscript Jo's agency turned down. Soon, there are attacks against her business and even her clients. Suspicions are cast among the people at the agency and the police even wonder if Jo didn't have too much to gain when the attacks turn deadly.In Barbara Rogan's smashing new thriller, Jo will have to look clearly at her colleagues, herself and her past if she's going to see it through. Every aspect of A DANGEROUS FICTION works together and works so wonderfully well. Rogan's experience as a literary agent provides a fascinating look at how the business works. The hopes and dreams of writers are balanced against the realities of publishing. The personal life of the widow of a literary giant such as Jo and her pursuit by a biographer are played against each other well, and serve the story's marvelously realized journey of its protagonist. Anyone interested in a picture of how publishing works will be fascinated by the inner workings. As someone who once read unsolicited manuscripts for a mystery house, I can certainly attest to the quality of so many submissions in the scenes addressing this. Rogan's love of good books also shines through.Jo is an interesting character who came up from nothing the hard way. That she didn't let her austere, loveless upbringing warp her is part of the reason the entire novel works so well. She is strong but not perfect (and the explanation of a \"Mary Sue\" character created by a fictional writer shows just how well Jo is developed). Her colleagues and writers are fascinating to watch. There are easily more heroes than suspects, and to have a strongly written novel in which so many characters are shown to be good-hearted is a pleasure to read. And, while it may not be the most important part of the story to many, setting is strongly evoked throughout the novel. The bustle of Manhattan, the glory of a farmhouse, the entrancing Santa Fe are all portrayed in their best light. It's a treat to read a story in which it's so easy to picture the characters where they are.Just make certain you have time set aside when you start A DANGEROUS FICTION because this fast-paced novel is the kind you don't want to put down until the last page is read."}, {"userName": "Katherine Clark", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5115292-katherine-clark", "userReview": "What a shame. I feel as though it has been weeks since I read a good book. Oh well. In this book, I found the protagonist annoying--she is incredibly beautiful and incredibly talented, and wealthy and beloved--wow! But she has had a tough life. Oh dear God. Anyway, I guessed the murderer really early, and while I liked the growth of the protagonist (well done) it just wasn't enough. I don't understand why the book was so well-blurbed. REally? Well, I don't need to read any others by Rogan."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3208300-julie", "userReview": "Literary agent Jo Donovan is in charge of a highly successful agency representing some great talent. Widow of a talented and well-regarded author, Hugo Donovan, Jo has made a name for herself and is much sought after. But when a would-be author begins stalking her, insisting she must read his manuscript and take him on as a client, things start to go wrong. Soon, her clients are attacked, and Jo is reunited with an old flame who is now a police detective in charge of her case.A Dangerous Fiction by Barbara Rogan is a mystery that encompasses the world of publishing. Rogan brings us into the everyday happenings of a literary agency, the roles people play in choosing and promoting books and authors, and the dangers that arise when authors are rejected. The mystery was well-done, keeping me turning pages from beginning to end, and not giving away the truth until it was finally revealed.As much as this is a page-turner, I found it a bit of a slow read ~ for a good reason. The writing style was wonderful. I found I wanted to linger over every word and sentence, rather than reading quickly as I tend to do with mysteries. Here's an example from the preface: \"He smiled as one does at an oft-heard joke. I looked at him properly for the first time. The boyishness was gone, but the lines around his eyes and mouth suited him, lending gravitas to his face. His eyes were green, but a darker, warier shade than I remembered, rain forest instead of meadow. I wondered if he'd ever married. His ring finger was bare, which meant nothing. Hugo and I exchanged rings when we married, but Hugo never wore his. It chafed him when he wrote, he'd said.\"The characters in A Dangerous Fiction are well-drawn, although we definitely get to know Jo more than others. I still felt the other characters with whom she works and interacts were quite realistic. And it was fun to get a glimpse into a literary agency. While there is some violence ~ it's a murder mystery, after all ~ this is more of a cozy mystery than the more harsh thrillers I sometimes read. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys mysteries, especially those interested in publishing."}, {"userName": "Kimberly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20147847-kimberly", "userReview": "The book kept me guessing until the end when the final twist is revealed. Part of what I enjoyed about the book was the idea of story and how we create our own story often because we are afraid to face what really happened. The protagonist is the young widow of a well-known author. She owns one of the top literary agencies in New York. She believes that she had the perfect marriage. She refuses to listen to anything that conflicts with the story of her marriage that she has convinced herself is true. Ultimately her inability to critically examine her past puts her in the path of a murderer bent on revenge.A want-to-be writer begins stalking Jo Donovan after his manuscript is rejected by her literary agency. Her world begins to rapidly fall apart after various actions threaten her agency and people close to her are murdered. A couple of her clients offer help. One of them, a former FBI profiler turned writer, encourages her to go to the police. The NYPD detective assigned to the case turns out to be her former boyfriend who has a very different perspective of their relationship and how it ended. Everyone is a suspect at some point as the police try to find Jo\u2019s stalker and the murderer (are they one and the same?) before the murderer strikes again.Disclosure: I received this book as part of a Goodreads giveaway on the premise that I would review it."}, {"userName": "Brandi Larsen", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/326512-brandi-larsen", "userReview": "I loved this book!

I can say that I have never read a book like this one before, it is definitely unique. I liked it way more than I thought I would and I am more than happy to try and convince you to read it. This was an incredibly fun read. The main character, Jo Donovan, is a literary agent and she views everything through that literary lens, making this a delightful read, especially for readers and writers. The reader gets a look inside the publishing industry and how it is for literary agents. Getting that inside look was probably one of my favorite things about this book. Jo is a very strong female, but she also has some flaws, making her more real. I can tell you with absolute certainty that I loved every single character in A Dangerous Fiction. They were all unique and each one added a little something special to the story. I grew attached to all of them. I would give you a run down but there are too many, so instead you should just read the book to find out. Oh and for you animal lovers out there, there is an amazing guard dog in this book that I think you will love.A Dangerous Fiction is incredibly more complex than it may seem at first. It\u2019s full of twists and turns and a few omg moments. This book made me feel so many different emotions while reading, one minute I was laughing and the next I was crying. It will play with your emotions and once you hit a certain part of the story you will want to find this horrible stalker more than the main character herself. I had an inkling of who it may be, but I never guessed. It was really intense near the end of the book. I still get goosebumps thinking about it. I promise the bad guy reveal will be worth the read.I recommend this book to everyone, but especially those of you who are avid readers, writers, or interested in the publishing industry. This was a unique mystery novel with memorable characters. Take a chance on A Dangerous Fiction and be ready for a well written novel that shows us just how much stories play a part in our everyday lives. ** I received a free copy through Shelf Awareness and the publisher for my honest review.

But an understated good, if that makes sense. I read quite a few ARC's, so it's always great when I get to read one I enjoy so much. And this one was published in July, so if you like a good mystery novel, go buy this or get it from your library.The tone of the novel harkens back to classic crime novels, i.e.: \"It was a dark and storm night,\" from Paul Clifford. Literary Agent Jo Donovan has lead a tough life, but she's a fighter and has come out on top. She runs on of the best literary agencies, although widowed, had a wonderful relationship with a renowned author, and has some great close friends.But an ambitious writer threatens to ruin it all, when he starts stalking her and attacking those around her. At the same time, and ambitious author working on a biography of her late husband, starts digging around, causing Jo to question if her memory is as accurate as she thinks.And of course there needs to be a little romance, as an old fame who is now a NYPD detective takes her case, and tries to help her track down who her stalker is.As I said above, I really enjoyed it and it was hard to put down (which is my favorite type of book). The plot is neat, and ties up loose ends, which I appreciate. And the characters are complex and true to life.The author's page on GoodReads mentions this is the \"first in a new mystery series set in the high-stakes world of big publishing,\" so I'm excited to hear there may be more.

However, Rogan\u2019s writing style more than made up for any shortcomings, and in no way, did they detract from a thoroughly enjoyable read.Barbara Rogan knows how to set up a good mystery.

On the surface, she's flawless: intelligent, a great agent, stoic and strong but tender and emotional. She's built a safe life idealizing her husband's memory, but that life is threatened by blow after blow to her reputation, personal life, employees, and clients. When her best friend is murdered, she begins to seriously doubt her memories and must confront her past. A mystery set in the world of New York literary agents and publishers--with spot-on descriptions of the writer's plight. A few quotes:\"Writers. Every one I\u2019d ever met was bipolar, the poles being arrogance and insecurity.\"What writer hasn't felt that way? Ack.\"One has to make allowances for writers, especially the unpublished ones.

If you're in the midst of the submission process, you'll find this an intriguing story. Be forewarned: It echoed my feelings so well that it was depressing.

When a would-be client starts stalking her, she starts to see ominous shadows everywhere. Then someone close to her dies in suspicious circumstances, and Jo herself becomes a suspect. It's been a few months since I read this one so I'm struggling to remember all the details, but it was very enjoyable. For a start, I didn't figure out who the baddie was at all - massive surprise at the end. And the way that Jo's security was taken away, step by step, was quite... not chilling, but obviously devastating for Jo. The cast size is just about right. Rogan develops 5-6 characters enough that they could all be suspects and that Jo has thorough interactions with them, without any of them feeling like they take over the story. There are some cute bit-part characters too. I loved the ex-Marine with the guard dog.It's all set in New York and is very New York, though not as totally New York as a couple of other books I read later in the year (particularly Let The Great World Spin and My Salinger Year).Definitely worth a read - it's a quick thriller, but with a fun literary setting and pretty well done."}, {"userName": "Erin Bell", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21641467-erin-bell", "userReview": "\"A Dangerous Fiction\" by Barbara Rogan is a well written mystery novel about a young woman who grew up a tough orphan in the Country, having fought hard to leave the past behind, she comes through on the other side a successful literary agent with wealth some celebrities would be jealous of.
