Normally, this is the kind of fiction I stay away from. I was afraid it would be an overwrought melodrama about provincial people living in a boring town. Yet, I was so absorbed by the lives of these people and had a difficult time putting the book down.The characters were very well developed, the town vividly described, and the emotions raw. Olive Kitteridge left me feeling very unsettled. I admire her quiet strength, her forthrightness, her realistic views of life, and the fact that she controls her emotions. I hate her brusqueness, her self-centeredness, and her difficulty with accepting changes. She was a complex character, definitely not your stereotypical cranky old lady. Each story is presented from different viewpoints and shows Olive\u2019s many sides as she interacts with family, neighbors and friends, as she experiences age, loneliness, grief and love. The characters are realistically drawn with such an emotional depth that I found I could easily identify with them and even see similarities to people I know. Olive Kitteridge makes me hate those qualities in myself that are like hers and makes me look at others with more patience and a less judgmental eye."}, {"userName": "Scott Axsom", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7099104-scott-axsom", "userReview": "I finished this book a couple of weeks ago and I\u2019ve struggled since to find the reasons why Elizabeth Strout\u2019s Olive Kitteridge struck me so deeply. So let me start by just saying; this book was awesome. Appreciating the reasons why, however, required from me considerable introspection. The subtlety of its beauty is indeed the mark of a great novel.I came to this book reluctantly and I\u2019m not sure why - anything with a Pulitzer usually draws me like a bear to honey - but perhaps it was due to the structure. I\u2019m not a fan, by nature, of the novel-in-stories format. Sure, I loved \nA Visit from the Goon Squad\n but that was the exception proving the rule for me. To make matters worse here, the first chapter in Olive Kitteridge introduces us to the title character and she\u2019s just not a very nice person, at least where her treatment of her husband is concerned. Strout\u2019s use of the novel-in-stories form, however, is pitch-perfect for the fundamental story she tells. She introduces us to a title character who appears to be considerably less than worthy as the subject of an entire novel. Then, through the use of deeply honest and insightful chapters about nearly unrelated characters, she paints a picture of this character that is infinitely richer than I originally assumed. And here is the beauty of Strout\u2019s use of this form; she lead me to discover that the assumptions I\u2019d made about a complex human being (as each inherently is) were necessarily as narrow as the context of their formulation. Strout's character development is a subject worthy of a college course. Throughout Olive Kitteridge she introduces us to characters whose situations resonate and whose responses to those situations are as believable as they are often maddening. And through it all, Olive Kitteridge\u2019s impact on those characters and their lives comes peeking through again and again until I begin to realize, 'Wow, this woman, for whom I didn\u2019t care so much, has had a profoundly positive impact on her world'.And this, I think, brings us to the real genius behind Elizabeth Strout\u2019s work in Olive Kitteridge. She has taken the novel-in-stories and used it to introduce us to the many diverse and far-flung characters upon whose disparate lives her title character has imparted some bit of change, some bit of love, or wisdom, or influence, and in doing so Strout has shown that we are infinitely complex creatures who, no matter how long or short our duration on this plane, will leave change in our wake. The character Olive Kitteridge was recognizable as much for her inherent nobility as for her glaring flaws and she reminded me of this: Though people are complicated, often less than noble, always imperfect creatures, each of us has profound significance in this world. And for that wonderful bit of enlightenment, I\u2019ll never forget her. As did \nWinter Wheat\n, this book altered my view of humanity and, for that, I feel both oddly indebted (she is make-believe, after all) to Olive Kitteridge and deeply grateful for the work of Elizabeth Strout."}, {"userName": "Michael Finocchiaro", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48483884-michael-finocchiaro", "userReview": "I don't quite understand what the hubbub was about this book: it did after all get a Pulitzer and TV show. However, I felt that the writing was ok, the narration was interesting, but I never even came close to feeling some sympathy or connection to Olive like I did for Updike's Rabbit Angstrom or, say, Bellow's Dean Corde. The New England she describes as anti-Semitic and full of silent scandals was more interesting and fun in, say Updike's Witches of Eastwick. It was a little unsettling and disappointing to leave most of the stories in suspension (if not all of them) and I felt that the Christopher character and his two wives were pretty two dimensional. The overall aura was oppressive and depressing. I am not sure I would come back to this one.I have now read all the Pulitzers from 2011 and 4 from the previous decade and I'd have to say that this one, The Known World by Edward P Jones and All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr were all disappointing...I wonder what the list will look like for 2017.

A couple of the stories (that have too little Olive in them) lag; but I wasn't looking for perfection, just the absence of pretension.No pretension here, people.

I am not worthy. I AM NOT WORTHY!How, in the name of all that is holy, does Elizabeth Strout do it? I mean, how does she create a book out of a collage of stories, linked by one exceptionally prickly, ornery yet honest character, through writing that is at once complex and invitingly simple? HOW?This 2009 Pulitzer winner is fully deserving of its accolades and superfans. I read this with keen interest and pleasure all the way through. It's a collection of 13 stories which could stand alone, but which are linked because they take place in the same small community of Crosby, Maine and feature (either prominently or in the background) caustic but decent Olive Kitteridge. Each story is so intimate. Through the everyday lives of these people, Strout delves deep into the heart. Almost to the point where I felt I was reading someone's diary. I really felt I knew these people.I've heard complaints that this book is depressing. Really? Have you looked at real life, lately? God. For some reason after I finished reading this book I thought about some long-time family friends. Friends of my parents - both teachers, lovely people. He played organ at their church. She kept their beautiful home neat as a pin. They had two kids, one of which has Down syndrome (and who still lives with them part time today at the age of 38). As the years went on, she developed migraines and a heart condition. Then their house was lost in a flood and they got no insurance money, had to start over financially at retirement age. Their relationship with their daughter is complex and often unpleasant, so it's not always easy to see their three grandchildren. He has now been diagnosed with Alzheimer's. So it goes. This is life... it's not always pretty. It's not easy. We all struggle and go through the shit. And in the midst of the shit, there are these revelatory, redemptive moments. Maybe they are private moments, maybe not. Maybe they don't change the trajectory of our lives, maybe they do. But they make it all worthwhile.

There is actually nothing innovatory in Elizabeth Strout's fantastic short story collection but she knows perfectly well how to orchestrate a fabulous and gut-wrenching short story: every single one of her thirteen becomes a flawless portrait in & of itself. In the fictional town of Crosby, Maine, the skeletons-in-the-denizen's-closets include thoughts of suicide, deaths, marriages, affairs. Somehow, the only other writer that's able to manifest this type of impact on the reader is Jhumpa Lahiri (it is little coincidence that her beauty of a novel, \"Interpreter of Maladies\" like \"Olive Kitteridge\" also won the Pulitzer).

They are not as closely woven together as the multi-generational tales in works by Louise Erdrich, another writer who likes to collect small parts into a larger whole, but Strout has put together a compelling portrait of a small town. I was reminded of Spoon River, as we learn some of the secrets each of the main characters protects. Lake Wobegon came to mind, as well. It most resembles Winesburg, Ohio, Sherwood Anderson\u2019s joined tales of alienation in small-town America. Olive Kitteridge is the organizational core connecting the thirteen stories. She appears in each one, sometimes as a primary character, sometimes as a secondary and in others by one of the characters referring to her. Elizabeth Strout - from her fans FB siteLoneliness was the predominant theme in the town of Crosby, Maine, loneliness or the fear of it. Most of the stories touch on relationships sagging, empty or gone, getting through emotional hard times and wondering if it is all worth the effort. There is a chilly New England sensibility here, characters that are unable to move past their stiff upper lips. Communication is guarded, often absent, but always made manifest in actions, if not words. Some succumb to their worst impulses, others find their way through to some sort of reconciliation with life\u2019s travails. Yet hope pops up just as frequently, like crocuses in March.  Frances McDormand as Olive \u2013 from a NY Times article on the actressOlive journeys through her trials, her marriage, her relationship with her son, her potential marital digression. She seems clueless as to her effect on others, and can be glaringly harsh, while displaying the capacity for kindness and understanding.The writing is brilliant, taut, dense, a torte, and thus, a joy. A short-story writer\u2019s talent for telling large amounts in small spaces, repeated 13 times. Personally, I felt the tales had maybe a bit too much resonance. I recognized emotions, if not always specific situations, (and yeah, some specific situations too) that I have experienced, and saw through the eyes of a third party experiences that were likely to have been a part of the history of people in my life.

Intelaiatura che a me piace e affascina parecchio (vedi anche la Egan di Il tempo \u00e8 un bastardo e la Munro di Chi ti credi di essere?).Frances McDormand interpreta Olive nella versione televisiva diretta da Lisa Cholodenko andata in onda nel 20014.Nel caso di Strout, sono anche pi\u00f9 indipendenti che nel caso di Sofia: all\u2019interno di ogni singolo racconto, Strout ripete notazioni gi\u00e0 dette, ribadisce dettagli, proprio come se i suoi racconti fossero nati per vivere separati, e solo in seguito collegati.In questa raccolta romanzo, i vari racconti (tredici) dipingono una piccola comunit\u00e0 provinciale del Maine sul finire dello scorso millennio fino ai giorni nostri, dopo l\u2019attentato alle Torri Gemelle, che viene citato pi\u00f9 di una volta. In quasi tutti i racconti compare lei, Olive Kitteridge, a volte di sfuggita, a volte di sfondo, o di passaggio, oppure protagonista assoluta.Olive Kitteridge probabilmente non \u00e8 la persona pi\u00f9 interessante del Maine. Sa anche essere piuttosto insopportabile, se non addirittura ottusa e odiosa. Spesso viene voglia di allontanarsi da lei, viene voglia di scappare, proprio come ha fatto suo figlio Christopher che un bel giorno ha messo quattromila e passa chilometri di distanza fra s\u00e9 e la madre e dalla costa Est s\u2019\u00e8 trasferito in California. Faccio fatica a capire come Olive sia riuscita ad appropriarsi del titolo dell\u2019opera, per giunta in solitario \u2013 come abbia fatto a essere la star di questo film, io avrei scelto altri protagonisti, tra i tanti personaggi che Strout presenta, a cominciare dal marito.La miniserie di quattro episodi, pi\u00f9 che dignitosa trasposizione televisiva, \u00e8 stata girata principalmente in Massachusetts, non nel Maine.Olive \u00e8 qualcuno di cui si dice che aveva un atteggiamento al di l\u00e0 di ogni giustificazione, e ci si domanda come il marito faccia a sopportarla (e in effetti, Henry, il marito farmacista, ha sempre provato un insolito intenso piacere nell\u2019uscire di casa al mattino per andare al lavoro, un piacere ben pi\u00f9 vivo di quello di rientrare in casa la sera).Il figlio, ormai grande, in procinto di diventare anche padre, le dice con calma e franchezza: Tu hai un pessimo carattere\u2026sei capace di far stare malissimo gli altri. Hai fatto stare malissimo pap\u00e0\u2026Tuttavia, grazie all\u2019abilit\u00e0 di Strout, e forse anche all\u2019imponente stazza, Olive \u00e8 paradigmatica e sembra quasi contenere e accogliere e comprendere l\u2019intera comunit\u00e0 di Crosby, Maine.Elizabeth Strout lavora sulle situazioni, le descrizioni, i dettagli, istantanee, tessere, atmosfere, apparenti divagazioni, pi\u00f9 che vere trame. E cos\u00ec, il mosaico si compone guardandolo tutto insieme, non isolando i pezzetti, fotogramma dopo fotogramma il film si forma.Richard Jenkins interpreta Henry, il marito di Olive, pi\u00f9 paziente di Giobbe.Non sceglie solo il tran tran, la quotidianit\u00e0 banale, la stupefacente normalit\u00e0 dei viventi, come sostiene Baricco, ci sono situazioni fuori dall\u2019ordinario (se non altro, c\u2019\u00e8 da sperare che non siano situazioni quotidiane): c\u2019\u00e8 chi cade in mare dalla scarpata per raccogliere fiori e chi si lancia in salvataggio (non si sapr\u00e0 mai se ce la fanno o meno) - ci sono tossici mascherati che sequestrano degli ostaggi - una ragazzina muore di anoressia \u2013 un matrimonio viene disdetto il giorno della celebrazione, con la chiesa piena di invitati e la sposa in abito bianco\u2026 Elizabeth Strout sa che anche molti buoni matrimoni nascondono la solitudine di uno dei due partner, o di entrambi: e anche in presenza di un amore solido, un incontro pu\u00f2 essere pi\u00f9 fatale di quanto si vorrebbe.In una piccola comunit\u00e0, \u00e8 pi\u00f9 facile che l\u2019amante di tuo marito sia anche una tua amica: e pi\u00f9 la comunit\u00e0 \u00e8 piccola, e pi\u00f9 \u00e8 facile che sia anche la tua migliore amica. Se non lo \u00e8, \u00e8 comunque qualcuno che conosci, che incroci e incontri.Alla morte del marito, Olive sembra trovare un po\u2019 di consolazione in compagnia del nuovo vicino di casa, interpretato da Bill Murray. Due solitudini che si incontrano brevemente.E cos\u00ec, man mano, questa piccola citt\u00e0 della provincia americana, questo peytonplace, diventa familiare molto pi\u00f9 di Orte o Forl\u00ec - l\u2019immaginario americano \u00e8 pi\u00f9 forte di quello italiano, non c\u2019\u00e8 nulla da fare, oltreoceano hanno sempre capito che la cultura \u00e8 un ottimo mezzo per trasmettere al mondo i propri modelli (e quindi, occupare potere).Siamo dalle parti di Anne Tyler, non solo geograficamente, ma anche come tono (scrittura liscia e piana come un tavolo di biliardo, senza impennate, tutti pensano di sapere tutto, ma in realt\u00e0 nessuno sa mai un cavolo di niente), mi riferisco alla Tyler dell\u2019epoca migliore (Ristorante Nostalgia) prima che cominciasse a ripetere se stessa a usura.L\u2019ambientazione \u00e8 un piccolo paese del Maine, con il bar del molo, il negozio che vende doughnuts, il liceo dove insegnava Olive, la farmacia gestita dal marito.Non tutto \u00e8 sempre credibile, la mano di Strout non \u00e8 abile alla stessa maniera in tutte le pagine.Poi, proprio come nel libro di Cognetti, sembra che l\u2019ultimo capitolo/racconto debba essere decisamente inferiore a tutti quelli che hanno preceduto.In questo caso m\u2019immagino che sia andata cos\u00ec: Strout ha fatto leggere il manoscritto a un\u2019amica che le ha detto \u201c\u00e8 molto bello Liz, mi piace. Ma quanto dolore! Quanto grigio e quanta amarezza! Anche il mare sembra sempre grigio e agitato, mai una volta che mettesse la voglia di fare il bagno!\u201dE allora Strout ha aperto il barattolo della melassa e l\u2019ha rovesciato intero nell\u2019ultimo racconto: con il risultato di lasciarmi a bocca amara per eccesso di zucchero.E cos\u00ec non posso fare a meno di chiedermi se il mondo non sarebbe un posto migliore senza gente come Olive Kitteridge che, per una manciata di momenti di comprensione e calore e viva comunicazione, ha sparso e distribuito tonnellate di acidit\u00e0 e sgradevolezza.E mi chiedo anche quale sia la libidine di riconoscere qualcuno degli abitanti di Crosby, Maine, nel proprio dirimpettaio o nel macellaio, come se con i vicini non bastasse averci a che fare quotidianamente gi\u00e0 qui, in Rome, Italy.PSMi piace l\u2019entusiasmo di Baricco per questo libro, gli genera belle parole, tipo queste: Quasi tutti i personaggi fotografati sono anziani, o sull\u2019orlo della pensione, o gi\u00f9 di l\u00ec. Bisogna vederli, infagottati in quella loro pelle di carta velina, mentre spiano i battiti del cuore, un po\u2019 a vigilare sull\u2019eventuale infarto, e un po\u2019 a registrare, stupefatti, l\u2019ostinata epifania di desideri fuori tempo massimo. Sono magnifici quando si chinano sul libro mastro della loro vita a calcolare, mettendo in colonna i ricordi, una somma che non viene mai. Covano rimorsi per cui non hanno pi\u00f9 tempo, e rimpianti che fanno fatica a ricordare. Leggono il giornale, costernati dall\u2019aver dimenticato quale \u00e8 stato il preciso momento in cui hanno cessato di avere delle opinioni. Ogni tanto squilla il telefono, e forse \u00e8 uno dei figli, ormai grandi, ma poi non lo \u00e8 quasi mai, e allora tornano a sciabattare in quelle loro piccole case rese enormi dal silenzio, e dalle stanze vuote. Tuttavia sono capaci di ridere, ognuno ha un segreto a cui si scalda nell\u2019inverno di quel crepuscolo, e tutti sanno che \u00e8 un dono, ogni mossa della vita \u2013 anche quel giallo del bosco, o lo zucchero sulla ciambella.PPSSTra i protagonisti pi\u00f9 ricorrenti, i tulipani che Olive pianta ogni anno, e la mirica cerifea, l\u2019albero della cera tipico del nord America.Crosby, Maine, luogo letterario."}, {"userName": "Dolors", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18383778-dolors", "userReview": "\u201cShe didn\u2019t like to be alone.

Olive Kitteridge is the result of a finely threaded gossamer of stories told by a cacophony of voices that bring Ollie, as her benevolent husband Henry calls her, to life through polyhedral perspectives of her complex personality, the interactions she has with other characters and the expectations they project on her. And so Olive never achieves a stationary condition, she is incessantly eroded by a patchwork of inner and outer circumstances, direct and tangent relationships and the process of ageing that gradually transforms an archetypal anti-heroine into a conflicted woman, sometimes cruel, sometimes obstinate, but above all, flawed and very humane.\u201cAll these lives,\" she said. \"All the stories we never know.\u201d A parade of small miseries, touching greatness and inevitable bewilderment that is ever present in the majority of human actions marches past Olive\u2019s eyes while she weeds her petunias, shaping her self-consciousness and dislocating the core of her existence. Young people seeking death, rebellious teenagers, spiteful offspring, widows who ponder about the meaning of life, elderly couples rejuvenated by the possibility of a new love, marriages that last because of inertia, painful solitudes, unjustified acts of violence, a conglomerate of singular individuals that become iconic paradigms of life in an American town in modern times and the whirlpool of secrets underneath.With highly polished and lucid language, not exempt of irony or biting humor, and making use of the third-person narrator, which provides the precise distance to observe the characters from the vantage point straddling clinical objectivity and psychological empathy, Elizabeth Strout masters the technique of creating a homogeneous atmosphere that brings together an apparently disperse plot delivered by way of unconnected stories. And Olive, that familiar character that equally infuriates and charms the reader, personifies the grandiosity and desolation of daily existence and winks mischievously to the histrionic self that is hidden in each of us.Life is a strange, convoluted business and staying afloat, regardless of the inexorable passage of time that will escort all of us to the same ominous culmination, is a small act of bravery. Strout\u2019s tapestry of intimate details and acute observations reverberates with that truth and at the end of the journey, Olive Kitteridge turns out to be a universal mirror that absorbs the dull grey of existence and exudes the vivid promise of second chances.\u201cOh, insane, ludicrous, unknowable world! Look how she wanted to live, look how she wanted to hold on.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Joe Valdez", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26876584-joe-valdez", "userReview": "The best novel I've read since joining Goodreads is East of Eden by John Steinbeck. The second best is Olive Kitteridge by Elizabeth Strout. Published in 2008 and winner of the 2009 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, this collection of thirteen stories all feature or focus on a retired seventh grade math teacher in the fictional seaside town of Crosby, Maine as she enters the winter of her life, still in possession of the vinegar her former students or fellow townsfolk have tasted for years. Like Steinbeck, Strout's canvas is big and her work is bold, infused with subtle wit and passion, and is undiluted by commercial considerations while in the pursuit of emotional honesty. This novel made me think about my life, particularly my relationship with my Olive-like mother.In the first chapter, simply labeled \"Pharmacy,\" Strout opens us to the life of Henry Kitteridge, a mild-mannered man who likes people, doesn't like to hear from cursing and never misses church or a civic activity. His wife is Olive doesn't like most people, stops attending Sunday service and sees through people to their flaws or frailties while her husband, a pharmacist, is more sympathetic (or na\u00efve, depending on your point of view). Henry hires a bright newlywed named Denise Thibodeau to help around the pharmacy. Denise's husband is also named Henry and Henry Kitteridge's year with the young couple is one of the happiest in his life, if not the happiest. Like most things, it doesn't last.He passes by where the pharmacy used to be. In its place now is a large chain drugstore with huge glass sliding doors, covering the ground where both the old pharmacy and grocery store stood, large enough so that the back parking lot where Henry would linger with Denise by the dumpster at the day's end before getting into their separate cars--all this is now taken over by a store that sells not only drugs, but huge rolls of paper towels and boxes of all sizes of garbage bags. Even plates and mugs can be bought here, spatulas, cat food. The trees off to the side have been cut down to make a parking lot. You get used to things, he thinks, without getting used to things.In the fourth chapter, \"A Little Burst,\" Olive Kitteridge marries off her only child, Christopher, a sensitive boy who grows up to be a podiatrist. Christopher caps a six week romance to a visiting gastroenterologist named Dr. Suzanne Bernstein (Dr. Sue) with a wedding. Olive notes that for all of her knowledge, Dr. Sue doesn't know a thing about flowers, one of Olive's remaining passions. The Kittreidges have built Christopher a house which the couple envisions being filled with grandchildren. But Olive is torn apart by the loss of her son and sequesters herself in their bedroom during the reception. Olive and Christopher's relationship has been strenuous, and she questions whether she's been a good mother.Olive, on the edge of the bed, leans her face into her hands. She can almost not remember the first decade of Christopher's life, although some things she does remember and doesn't want to. She tried teaching him to play the piano and he wouldn't play the notes right. It was how scared he was of her that made her go all wacky. But she loved him! She would like to say this to Suzanne. She would like to say, Listen, Dr. Sue, deep down there is a thing inside me, and sometimes it swells up like the head of a squid and shoots blackness through me. I haven't wanted it to be this way, but so help me, I have loved my son.In the fifth chapter, \"Starving,\" Harmon Newton is also drawn to the vitality of a young couple, a boy named Tim working at the sawmill for the summer and his ragamuffin girlfriend Nina, whom Tim met following Phish on tour. Harmon's house empty save his emotionally distant wife Bonnie, he's indulged in an affair with a young widow named Daisy Foster. Harmon decides to return his relationship with Daisy to its platonic roots, which Daisy accepts with grace and the two remain good friends. The troubled Nina, an anorexic, loses her boyfriend and her lodging and is taken in by Daisy. When Olive Kitteridge drops by to collect for the Salvation Army, she is overpowered by how sick Nina is and joins Harmon and Daisy is trying to see the girl receives treatment.You started to expect things at a certain age. Harmon knew that. You worried about heart attacks, cancer, the cough that turned into a ferocious pneumonia. You could even expect to have a kind of midlife crisis--but there was nothing to explain what he felt was happening to him, that he'd been put into a transparent plastic capsule that rose off the ground and was tossed and blown and shaken so fiercely that could not possibly his way back to the quotidian pleasures of his past life. Desperately, he did not want this. And yet, after that morning at Daisy's, when Nina had cried, and Daisy had gotten on the phone, making arrangements for the parents to come and get her--after that morning, the sight of Bonnie made him feel cold.\"Sad,\" \"bleak,\" \"boring,\" \"couldn't stand the main character\" are a few of the criticisms I've spotted in other reviews and I suppose if all you focus on is Olive Kitteridge or her darkest, most negative thoughts, you could feel that way about Olive Kitteridge. I found a whole lot more going on beneath the surface here than harshness. Going back to John Steinbeck and why he's my favorite author and creator of my favorite novel, Strout infuses her novel not with self-satisfied language or false hope, but with storytelling, namely, a wonderful amount of wit and passion. For example:Olive had graduated magna cum laude from college. And Henry's mother had actually not liked that. Imagine. Pauline had actually said something about magna cum laude girls being plain and not having much fun ... Well, Olive was not going to spoil this moment thinking of Pauline. She finished up, washed her hands, and looked around as she stuck them under the dryer, thinking how the bathroom was huge, big enough to do surgery in. It was because of people in wheelchairs. Nowadays you got sued if you didn't build something big enough for a wheelchair, but she'd rather somebody just shoot her if it came to that.Or:It has taken Marlene years to stop calling her Mrs. Kitteridge, which is what happens when you have people in school. And of course the opposite is true, which is that Olive continues to see half the town as kids, as she can still see Ed Bonney and Marlene Monroe as young schoolkids, falling in love, walking home day after day from school. When they reached Crossbow Corners, they would stand and talk, and sometimes Olive would see them there as late as five o'clock, because Marlene had to go one way and Ed the other.Olive is a retired seventh grade math teacher; my mother is a retired fifth grade science teacher. Olive is from Maine; my parents are from Texas. These are not soft people. Christopher has had a complicated relationship with his mother and made her cry; I have had the same experiences with my mother. Teachers can be authoritative and do not often accept that people won't do what they've decided would be best for them. I identified with Henry, who could be in love with a tough, intelligent woman like Olive without suffering as she suffers. He irritates his wife incessantly and Olive even considers leaving him at one point, but comes to realize that she has no better friend in the world.This is such a powerful character. What I valued in her was her honesty. This might be considered an affliction, but it is definitely not a weakness. The truth can be ugly. Strout understands that there are people like Henry Kitteridge who need to be helpful, building bridges and looking on the bright side but there are also people like Olive Kitteridge who'd rather be sick with misery at times but see things as they really are. This power has made students wary of her, like they'd beware a witch. Certain kids exhibiting signs of anxiety in her class would likely find Mrs. Kitteridge starting at them and later, confiding to them that if they ever needed to talk to someone they could talk to her. Olive knows.The novel stops short at complete and total satisfaction with two stories I felt most removed from Olive Kitteridge and her world--\"Criminal,\" in which a pyromaniac young woman reaches out of her loneliness to a catalogue company call center operator, and \"Ship In a Bottle,\" in which an 11-year-old watches her neurotic mother and older sister, jilted at the altar, bounce off each other. These chapters struggled to hold my attention but coming late in the book, made me want to spend more time with Olive. I can't fault Strout for making her title character such a strong presence. I could feel Olive Kitteridge changing me while I was reading it. The novel makes me want to call or write my parents more than I do, even if it's to reiterate things I've said and that they already know. It also makes me more conscious than ever of my dark side, how it's important not to be as na\u00efve as Henry, perhaps, nor as acidic in thought as Olive, when negativity sometimes makes it difficult for her to get out of bed. This book makes me appreciate that as often as we hear not to take life for granted, there are consequences for this that can branch you off whatever trail you're on in life and take you to a wilderness you may not like when you get there. Strout explores these pathways with grace, beauty and an absolute ardor for life."}, {"userName": "Teresa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/541416-teresa", "userReview": "4 and 1/2 starsWe all have known an Olive -- or at least, we think we know her. Strout shows us the parts we don't know, what's behind the prickliness and the 'attitude.' Through fiction, we now have a better understanding of such a person.It's a rare writer who can embody a character so well. And the minor characters too -- they are all living, breathing people. More than one of these 'minor' characters are so well-drawn and intriguing that I wouldn't have minded knowing more about them.Not all the stories are about Olive, though she 'appears' in all of them, if only peripherally. In three of the stories (and they might be my favorites, though it's hard to pick a favorite) other women (one 'older,' the others young) are the main characters, and Olive is just a thought in their heads. In two of the heads, she is a scary presence, but the older sister of the one who is afraid of her remembers something Olive told her when she was Olive's student and it gives her the courage to change her life.In the first story (about Olive's husband) I marked a simile that I liked: \"... she had a darkness that seemed to stand beside her like an acquaintance that would not go away.\" After finishing the last story, I reread the phrase. I found it an interesting contrast with the last story, which is full of sunlit imagery.4 and 1/2 stars, because I felt the ending of one otherwise strong story was too gimmicky."}, {"userName": "\u00b7Karen\u00b7", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652898-karen", "userReview": "WOW!How appropriate that Olive should be large: she is larger than life, human but more so. She's angrier, more unrepentant, and far less tolerant, of herself as much as of others, but at the same time she's also more feeling, more compassionate, more sensitive than the average member of the human race. She's raw, as if an insulating layer had been stripped away, leaving her to feel and see more than most. The magical thing is that you feel and see too, you develop a kind of preternatural sensitivity. Schiller's idea of an aesthetic education must have dreamt of this book. To read it makes you more human too.Is it sad when Olive has to visit a much depleted Henry in a nursing home? No, no, no. It's life. That's how life is. It ends some time. \"We all know this stuff is coming. Not many are lucky enough to just drop dead in their sleep.\" All the people here are struggling, pushing through, taking knocks and then standing up again to carry on. That's all there is.

I think Elizabeth Strout must be the type of person who is less of the entertainment school of writing and more of the vitamins school of writing. But, I am left wondering what nutritional value I got out of this. Mostly, it just seemed like a bunch of people sitting around being petty, judging other people\u2019s Issues, and thinking about cheating on each other. Like, whoa, deep. The structure of the book is a bunch of different short stories that all somehow reference this one bitchy lady, Olive Kitteridge. It\u2019s not a bad structure if there was something you wanted to know about the person, but in itself the structure is more of a gimmick than anything. Alone, it is neither good nor bad, but it\u2019s easy to get trapped in a gimmick and refuse to edit because you\u2019re married to it. I feel like that\u2019s what happened here. A few of the better stories only incidentally referenced Olive Kitteridge, and I think they could have made better (by which I mean more entertaining and containing a plot) overall stories than Olive\u2019s. Maybe I am just not interested in her. She is the mean math teacher, controlling mother, self-absorbed wife, busybody neighbor. None of the ways this played out were particularly appalling, but they were not endearing either. She started out meh and stayed meh throughout. I guess there is some reference in her character to the frigidness of New England towns, and I feel equally indifferent about that.But, okay, I did like this recurrent theme about not being afraid of our own hunger. The book probably explores desire, and the stories are probably all studies about human desire and how it expresses itself in different ways. I don\u2019t know, maybe all books are about that in some ways, and I'd rather read Wuthering Heights if I'm going for desire. This had alcoholism, anorexia, suicide, LOADS of adultery (contemplation), runaways, food allergies, robbery, murder (contemplation), and probably other topics like that. And then it ends (I guess spoiler alert, but it\u2019s not really like there is a plot to this book, so I don\u2019t think it really spoils anything) with a sort of huu-uuh in a story about some people in their seventies thinking about having sex with each other and how they were assholes to their kids. So, I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m going to give this two stars because it\u2019s so boring. Even the robbery is boring. I didn't hate it as much as it sounds like I did, but it would be a lie if I said I enjoyed it. There are all of these bloated similes, too, which are just painful. I can\u2019t think of an example now, but something like, \u201cShe gazed into her cup of coffee and then noticed on the counter crumbs of a muffin LIKE GRAINS OF THE SANDS OF TIME-IME-IME-IME.\u201d What. Ever. I\u2019m only exaggerating a little. Everything was like the ocean waves ebbing and flowing, etc. I listened to this on audio, and it was also meh. Now that I\u2019m looking at the cover, it seems oddly apt. When I first looked at it, I was like, what the fuck is that? And it seemed kind of interesting and complex. Then I realized it was just a boring leaf. Then I gazed at my coffee and noticed on the table the leaves of the book pages like the leaves of the book of time-ime-ime-ime. This business about the trappings of time was probably not literally in the book BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN.When she would come back to the hunger thing, though, I liked that. It seems like a good point \u2013 not to be afraid of our own hunger.

For there is no way a book wins this honorable prize without doing something that has not been done before, or without taking something that has been done before and doing it better. This chutzpah is usually in the form, the style, or the story arc. With this novel, it is the way in which short stories are interwoven using one subject: the idiosyncratic, Olive Kitteridge. Never mind that Olive is not the alluring one, for Olive is not really your likable personality; neither is she that much interesting. Her husband, Henry, scores more likeability points than she does in the beginning. Olive is a force to be reckoned with though. She is such an integral part of the discussion on life that Strout has introduced here. This is why following Olive is necessary because she is the lens through which life is not too often viewed in literature. She is a towering presence, a character who is discrepant and irascible. These characters living in the coastal town of Maine bring us different elements of the human condition. They are real characters, the neighbors next door to you, your best friend or spouse, your family. This is one great quality of the book, these characters who are real people:\n Henry stares out at the bay, at the skinny spruce trees along the edge of the cove and it seems beautiful to him, God's magnificence there in the quiet stateliness of the coastline and the slightly rocking water.\nThese stories glide. With each story, you are placed within a character's mind, you sense, for instance, his or her heartbreak and lost love:\nYou couldn't make yourself stop feeling a certain way, no matter what the other person did. You had to just wait. Eventually the feeling went away because others came along. Or sometimes it didn't go away but got squeezed into something tiny, and hung like a piece of tinsel in the back of your mind. \nIt is the way in which the story moves. Any other less-crafted book could have been a hundred pages longer. Not this one, because Strout weaves in and out of time deftly, transitioning through characters' lives with ease, giving the story grace. And it only takes her a few sentences to do so. The artful brevity that makes short short story collections work, is what makes this novel work. Things are slow when necessary, slow enough for you to once again capture a character's inner thoughts at a moment when some discovery that could damage a lifelong partnership, has been made:\nIn the darkness and the silence of the car, she felt some knowledge pass between them. And it had been sitting there in church with them, too, like a child pressed between them in the pew, this thing, this presence, that had made its way into their evening.\nThe more I read, the more I realized that this was a book deeply human; a book showcasing ordinary lives to show us how much we need to learn about ourselves, about each other. Love is a central theme here. So is grief, for all over the town, quiet grieving is taking place. There is also loneliness, forgiveness, acceptance--the importance of partnership. And what is special is how each character embodies the themes, how each character is somehow teaching a life lesson:\n She remembered what hope was, and this was it. That inner churning that moves you forward, plows you through life the way the boats below plowed the shiny water, the way the plane was plowing forward to a place new, and where she was needed."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15493045-lisa", "userReview": "Olive KitteridgeElizabeth Strout MY RATING \t\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0fPUBLISHER\tRandom HousePUBLISHED\tMarch 25, 2008Olive Kitteridge is emotionally powerful, lyrical and hard to forget. SUMMARYOlive, a retired school teacher in the coastal town of Crosby, Maine is the subject of a set of interlinked short stories. She is at times curmudgeonly, cold or abrupt and at other times vulnerable, hurting or just plain tired. She is human, and struggling to understanding herself and all the changes and challenges that life throws her way. She is found contemplating her marriage to Henry, her relationship with her son, Chris, and the loss of her mother. Former students and other townspeople grappling with their own problems are featured noting how Olive\u2019s words impacted their lives. This is an intimate portrait of a woman\u2019s self-discovery in thirteen vignettes of her life. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t make yourself stop feeling a certain way, no matter what the other person did.

At first, she seems old and brusque and you won\u2019t like her very much. Keep reading! With each new story, we find out a little bit more about her. Her character, we learn is so much more than our initial impression. She is full of emotions, wants, needs, thoughts, and feelings. Olive Kitteridge make us realize people are complicated, and there is so more to each of us, than what we can see on the surface. Elizabeth Strout\u2019s writing in this novel-in-stories format is lyrical. The stories are all different and all divine. A great read.

The writing is sheer brilliance. Every sentence is structured to perfection. Capturing slices of life and intricately dissecting small town folk. It\u2019s not the most cheeriest of books, with lots of the themes surrounding depression and suicide. Olive was a hard character to warm up to but once I did, I really did. It shows that no matter where you live, people have the same issues, of loneliness, ageing, sickness, relationships and family troubles and that it\u2019s not confined to big cities. How true the saying there\u2019s no such thing as a simple life. The fact of the matter is that life and its complications are universal. I loved how Olive at the age of 74 could still learn lessons. Big lessons that change her outlook on life and makes her appreciate being alive. Most of this book she imagines her death and seemingly welcomes it. It\u2019s often sad and had a melancholy feel throughout most of the book, making it a hard read at times. The beauty of this book however is the simplicity of telling a story through the many characters.

And with that, my review.Really, my problem in reviewing Strout's collection of short stories is that I didn't hate it or love it. I didn't even like it or dislike it. I'm not in any sense ambivalent toward it. Save for the fact that I'm baffled by its Pulitzer status (and the other fact that I wasted countless minutes actually reading the thing), I'd say that I couldn't be bothered to care about Olive Kitteridge one way or another.So I'm having a hard time mustering emotion enough to make you care about the book one way or other. Instead, I'll just talk about some things I know.I know that Olive Kitteridge is not well-written. It's not awful stuff and is mostly competent, but it's certainly not good. Strout falls into familiar patterns of withholding information in enough of her stories that one comes to expect it. The kind of thing where she'll open with \"After Event X, nothing was ever the same again\" and then keep the reader in the dark over what the event actually was, only revealing the nature of the event pages past the point at which anyone could continue to care. She deposits point-blank iterations of Chekov's gun in stories\u2014in one case, it's actually a gun too\u2014telegraphing story intention with painful clarity. She does that thing that's common in comic books where a character in the midst of some unbelievably implausible circumstance remarks (with a figurative nudge-and-wink) that the circumstance is unbelievably implausible and were it not really happening, people would be certain it was the product of bad fiction. (Only she's not writing a comic book. And it's cliched and unfunny even in comics.) And she reintroduces Olive and her circumstance with tedious frequency. I realize that several of these stories were written years ago, but some editing for flow would have been awesome.On the other hand, I know that Olive Kitteridge develops its characters generally pretty well. Especially its secondary characters, the ones who inhabit the book for only the space of a chapter or less. Those are the ones to whom Strout breathes life. Suicidal Kevin, jilted Julie, infidelitous Harmon. These are the people I wished the book would have continued with. Strout builds them into characters of interest and one wonders how they might recover from their stories.I also know that if the state of Maine has the means and opportunity, they should ban Strout from entry or residency. Strout paints a picture of Maine that makes it perhaps the least likely target for any of my future vacationing plans. And I certainly wouldn't ever choose to live there if the author's portrait is in anyway accurate. Essentially, if Olive Kitteridge is to be believed, the state is built out of a) crazy and b) infidelity. I think perhaps it was only the final chapter that was free of the stuff. It got to the point where I'd begin a new chapter and sigh audibly a couple pages in and then explain to my wife that I was reading another chapter about another person whose quietly (or even not so quietly) insane.I know that I did appreciate Strout's empathy for the aged. She brings to mind several of the difficulties and problematic philosophies of life that those of advanced age may surely feel if they are a) crazy or b) miserable. Reading Olive Kitteridge brought me forcefully to the conclusion that should I grow old, I honestly will beg with my mind to be forged of neither of these two (apparently common in Maine) characteristics. This is also a book that will be popular Christmas gifts from elderly parents to their grown-and-moved children, because nothing says Christmas Spirit like 270 pages of paperback guilt trip. I also know that had this book not been assigned reading, I would have put it down after maybe the fourth chapter and probably never gotten around to finishing it. It wasn't so much that it was bad as it was just plain not that compelling a read. I never cared for the story of the title character and knowing that the side characters wouldn't be returning left me nowhere to hang my hat. And there isn't really anything going on in the book beyond the surface elements of the very-disjointed story, so Strout really needed to make Olive's character and story sing.And it just didn't.And this brings me to the final thing I know and that I've already kind of given away from the start. I know that I feel like Elizabeth Strout is an Alice Munro cover band. She's probably alright if you're a fan of the real deal but for some reason can't get the real deal. Like you wanted to hear the Scorpions play \"Rock Me Like a Hurricane\" but you're on a party boat and all you've got is Scrantonicity II to play Scorpions hits. It might scratch your itch or it might not. Of course, for those who were never big fans of the Scorpions, you'll probably be up on deck for the entire set.That's me. I wish I had been up on deck reading some Paul Auster or Murakami or, heck, even some A.A. Milne while Olive Kitteridge played to the drunken several on the deck below."}, {"userName": "William1", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4684009-william1", "userReview": "Exquisite. A beautiful balance of images. All the senses deftly deployed in the description of action. At the same time, a nonlinear storyline, jumping about over a span perhaps of 25 years. Yet the book is a mousse of a confection, its execution so light, so assured. Moreover, it is a novel of stories. I can only remember this being done so well one other time in my broad reading experience, that was in Cynthia Ozick\u2019s The Puttermesser Papers. (See my review.) Great mastery of pattern and theme. No subject is ever nailed too directly on the nose. Strout has this wonderful way of sliding obliquely into her subject matter which merits closer study. Another surprising aspect of the book is what she chooses not to pursue. There\u2019s a line in Martin Amis\u2019s London Fields in which the narrator, who is also a writer, says \u201cone-hundred decisions on every page.\u201d Strout\u2019s writing is so engaging that even her omissions leave a resonance of expunged information, if one may put it that way.

These are ordinary people living ordinary lives, yet they they are so fascinating in their strengths and flaws, in their hopes and disappointments. It's difficult to read it and not recognise some aspect of your own life in its infinitely wise pages.These thirteen linked tales are mostly set in the small town of Crosby, Maine. Olive Kitteridge, a retired schoolteacher, features in every story, often taking centre-stage but not always. She is an intriguing creation - forthright, abrasive but also vulnerable, though the latter is something she doesn't like to show or admit. As another character memorably puts it: \"Olive had a way about her that was absolutely without apology.\" By contrast, her husband Henry is kind and friendly, but their relationship works, despite the hiccups that can occur in any marriage. They have one son: Christopher, a shy and anxious boy who they both worry and fuss over.In a close-knit community such as this, everybody knows each other's business, but there is also a healthy spirit of co-operation. In Starving, Olive and her neighbour Daisy do their best to help an anorexic young girl. In Basket of Trips, Olive attends the funeral of Marlene Bonney's husband, and in a poignant conversation between the two women, Marlene reveals what the cryptic title really means. And in the astonishing Incoming Tide, a former student of Olive's contemplates ending his unhappy life, when she shows up to comfort him in her own unique way. I've thought about this one every day since I read it.Themes of ageing, loneliness, and regret are all examined with enormous empathy and perception. I think every story broke my heart in a different way. But it's not all sadness and tragedy, there is plenty of wit and humour too. And hope, often when you least expect it. Just like real life then. Thank you, Elizabeth Strout, for this wonderful work of genius."}, {"userName": "Cheri", "userReviewDate": "Aug 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/106692-cheri", "userReview": "Olive Kitteridge is opinionated, domineering, judgemental, interfering and needy. Her husband Henry is gentle, timid and kind. Their life in a small town in Maine is complex, sad, and seemingly incomplete. Olive spends most of her time bitter and sad. Olive is the woman whose cold, offensive manner is an embarassment, Henry is the man whose expression always seems to be carrying an apology about his wife\u2019s behavior. Their son spends his life hoping for an apology from at least one of his parents. The various personalities in the thirteen chapters of this book fade in comparison to Olive Kitteridge. Olive\u2019s life has not turned out the way she had hoped, and it would seem that this is the one thing that almost everyone from Crosby, Maine has in common. While the level of despair varies from chapter to chapter, person to person, with Olive present, it\u2019s never really completely out of the picture. The characters are somehow disarmingly charming as various adversities befall them, their misfortunes reach out and grab hold and pull another Crosby-dweller into the story for a peek into their life. Through Strout\u2019s beautifully written intermingled stories she explores the characters of Crosby, Maine, exposing their emotions with depth and sharing every moment of sadness, loneliness, anger and disappointment as if they were their shadow."}, {"userName": "Sara", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5512657-sara", "userReview": "When I began this book, I was unsure how I was going to like it. The first story was interesting and I felt I had gotten to know Henry, but then it was over and the second story seemed to have little to do with the first. However, as the book progressed, I found myself loving the depth of the characters in the vignettes and the recurring characters of Olive and Henry that popped in and out, sometimes as full players and sometimes as sidebars.Olive is one of those characters we hate to have anything in common with. We don\u2019t want to recognize her, or relate to her, or think she mirrors us in any way, but we do. I did not like Olive, but I understood her far better than I like to admit. I wanted to ask her to look in the mirror and try to see what others saw when they looked at her. She lived in denial, it was her survival mechanism, and she paid a penalty that was painful at times to behold.Strout is an excellent writer and beneath her eloquent prose are important messages and insights.  \"...after all, life was a gift--that one of those things about getting older was knowing that so many moments weren't just moments, they were gifts. And how nice, really, that people should celebrate with such earnestness this time of year. No matter what people's lives might hold (some of these houses they were passing would have to hold some woeful tribulations), still and all, people were compelled to celebrate because they knew somehow, in their different ways, that life was a thing to celebrate.\"She understands the dynamics between people, how complex relationships are, how hurtful just living can be, and how lonely it is sometimes, even in the company of others. In the end, I thought the style in which the story was presented was inspired. It allowed us to see so many characters up-close, to get a sense of the community at large, and still to feel we had made the trip with Olive alone."}, {"userName": "Marilyn C.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8170584-marilyn-c", "userReview": "4.5 StarsI fell in love with Elizabeth Strout's writing last year when I read My Name is Lucy Barton. She has the ability to write on the essence of people's lives and can write on a deeper level of awareness into everyday life struggles. In the thirteen stories that make up Olive Kitteridge, Strout showed me once again her ability to connect all of us to each other. Even by the end of book, the grouchy, Olive Kitteridge had shown a side of herself all of us can relate to. The only reason I did not give this book the full five stars was that I felt some of the stories did not hold my complete attention. Still, it was a very compelling and thought provoking read."}, {"userName": "Camie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie", "userReview": "This Pulitzer Prize winning book has mostly good but mixed reviews, and I can understand that It wouldn't appeal to everyone. Since next month I will be one more year ( alarmingly !!!) closer to 60 and have been married 34 years, I'm guessing I'm the perfect demographic for this book. Though titled Olive Kitterigde after the matronly, retired math teacher with a rather brusque side , quite a few of the 13 interrelated stories are about other folks who share the same hometown of Crosby, Maine with her, some of whom are just casual acquaintances. The common thread that binds seems to be the fact that though given differing situations, everyone here appears to be struggling to find their place in the world. This book is chalk full of insight, but if you've never lived it you probably won't see it. Some themes here are aging, aging spouses, long marriages ( in one story described as a long complicated meal followed by a lovely dessert ), grown children, and life's joys and disappointments. In one story Basket Of Trips, even as the husband is dying, the couple pulls from the closet a basket of travel brochures and plans where they will travel next, knowing full well this will never come about. Yes, these stories are about people trying to figure out ways to get through the next day, week, or year, and they're realizing the way that their choices earlier in life have come back to make a lasting effect on ( or in a few cases haunt) them. This was a Wow of a book for me which I would highly recommend to my fellow seniors. 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2017", "userURL":

good writer that when I heard she had a new one out I went to buy it without even knowing the title, let alone the plot. And while she is still a wonderful writer, she seems to have reduced herself (prematurely, I would hope) to the pre retirment plan of Maeve Binchy; the incredibly unpleasant world of the multiple narrative novel.Her characters are sketched very well and her use of language pulls you in, but I really hate these snippets that aren't short stories, aren't novels - so what are they? Characters I meet briefly but in the context of a longer work so that the impact is all the more contrived, and one or two recurring people who become so tiresome and (Olive in particular) really unlikeable that you feel cheated for having this be the protagonist. It's very hard to feel attached to a book like this, and I would've minded less if it had been a book of short stories.I gave it three stars because it is still very readable and maybe if you know going in what the deal is it is less bothersome. The other drawback though is that it's really depressing - there is a thread of suicide running throughout as well as an emphasis on loneliness, and Oliva can really really be hateful, and Strout's attempts to make her sympathtic come way too late in the work."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1883816-barbara", "userReview": "Elizabeth Strout has penned a beautiful book, which has left me deeply pensive and tearful. I am not generally attracted to the short story, but this is not truly of that genre. It is a series of vignettes, many of which have Olive Kitteridge as the main character. Each story is about the inhabitants of Crosby, Maine, a small seaside village, all with complicated tales of their own. Olive is ever present, even fleetingly,to tie the people to her in some manner.When I first started reading, my thoughts kept reverting to John Mortimer's Rumpole, who referred to his wife as \"she who must be obeyed\". However, as I became better acquainted with Olive, I began to view her as a much more complex individual. Strout has adeptly painted the picture of an overly critical, irritable and intractable woman. She vacillates between being overly controlling to exerting an apparent desire to be helpful and needed. Strout has succinctly developed the psychology of this aging, lonely woman, who in her frequent fault-finding of others has failed to see her own errors. When she does view them, she feels helpless to mend her ways. She is a tragic, lonely woman. As the stories continue, Olive begins to view life with a more tender awareness and some constructive actions.There is so much more that can be stated about this wonderful book, but it is essential to give praise to Elizabeth Strout for this tender, sad and thought provoking work of literature. Although I rarely reread a book twice, I believe that this one will return to my shelf soon."}, {"userName": "BrokenTune", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10592271-brokentune", "userReview": "Olive Kitteridge is an extraordinary book. I had to read the first story quite a few times to get into the characters and the get what Strout wanted to do here. The writing is gorgeous. It must have required considerable effort and discipline to compile the selection of related and yet unrelated stories - all of which involve either Olive Kitteridge or people in her community in a small town in Maine - and yet keep the tone of the stories so even, so understated.There were two aspects of Olive Kitteridge that fascinated me most - and that are inevitably what makes or breaks this book for me:For one, the book focuses on people in the later stages of life. Mostly. It was great to read about characters who were not going through any rites of passage or growth.Hand in hand with this, however, came a sort of bleak realism that made it sometimes difficult to read the stories. It was the sort of realism that does not promise happy endings, and acts as a reminder that reality is often far removed from the hope and dignity which is lent to characters in stories.I was not sure at first whether I liked or disliked this book, and to some extent I still am not sure about this, but I am glad I have read it.3.5*"}], "description": "WINNER OF THE PULITZER PRIZEIn a voice more powerful and compassionate than ever before, New York Times bestselling author Elizabeth Strout binds together thirteen rich, luminous narratives into a book with the heft of a novel, through the presence of one larger-than-life, unforgettable character: Olive Kitteridge. At the edge of the continent, Crosby, Maine, may seem like nowhere, but seen through this brilliant writer\u2019s eyes, it\u2019s in essence the whole world, and the lives that are lived there are filled with all of the grand human drama\u2013desire, despair, jealousy, hope, and love.  At times stern, at other times patient, at times perceptive, at other times in sad denial, Olive Kitteridge, a retired schoolteacher, deplores the changes in her little town and in the world at large, but she doesn\u2019t always recognize the changes in those around her: a lounge musician haunted by a past romance: a former student who has lost the will to live: Olive\u2019s own adult child, who feels tyrannized by her irrational sensitivities; and Henry, who finds his loyalty to his marriage both a blessing and a curse.
