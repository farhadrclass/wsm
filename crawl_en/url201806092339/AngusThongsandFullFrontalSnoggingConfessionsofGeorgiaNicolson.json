Not a bad beginning-of-the-year pick-me-up.There are times when I just HAVE to read something to perk me up, something light and silly and mindless. Louise Rennison's books always do the trick. It doesn't hurt either that this first book in Confessions of Georgia Nicolson series is a winner of Printz Honor, proving that even the silliest story about make-up, boys, and snogging can be written brilliantly. Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging never takes itself seriously or tries to teach some kind of moral lesson. Instead, its only aim is to provide tons of fun; and the book succeeds at it every time I read it. I do not think there is any point for me to sing this novel any more praise to convince you to give it a try, rather, I will list some quotes here for you to see if Louise Rennison's humor is your cup of tea.Wednesday, December 2nd.8:30 a.m.Dashing out of the house, Jas and I almost fell into Mark, waiting by the corner. Jas (big pal) said she had to run to her house first and she would see me at school. I went a bit red and walked on with him walking beside me. He said, \"Have you got a boyfriend?\"I was speechless. What is the right answer to that question? I tell you what the right answer is... a lie, that's the right answer. So I said, \"I've just come out of a heavy thing and I'm giving myself a bit of space.\"He looked at me. He really did have the biggest gob [mouth:] I have ever seen. \"So is that no?\"And I just stood there and then this really weird thing happened... he touched my breast!!! I don't mean he ripped my blouse off, he just rested his hand on the front of my breast. Just for a second, before he turned and went off to school.12:30 p.m.What does it mean when a boy rests his hand on your breast? Does it mean he has a megahorn? Or was his hand just tired? 4:30 p.m.Why am I even thinking about this? No sign of Mark (the breast molester) when I got home, thank goodness.4:45 p.m.Still, you would think if a boy rests his hand on your breast he might bother to see you sometime.* * *Sunday, February 7th11:00 a.m.Got dressed in short skirt, then me and Jas walked up and down to the main road. We wanted to see how many cars with boys in them hooted at us. Ten!! (We had to walk up and down for four hours... still, ten is ten!!!)"}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/Meet Georgia.

I still am was an asshole much like Georgia back in the day. Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging is a year in the life of Georgia courtesy of her journal and was most definitely just what the doctor ordered for me to read on Presidential Debate Day. I never expected to laugh out loud reading the trials and tribulations of this teenie bopper, but I sure as shart did. Especially the part about her first tweezing experience . . . . \nHer quest for love with an unattainable crush . . . . \nAnd trying to get some uhhhhhhhh experience (if ya know what I\u2019m sayin\u2019) . . . . \n\u201cI lay on my arm until it went numb and then I lifted it (with the nonnumb arm) onto my breasts.

Basically, the only reason I read this book is because my lovely coffee-soddened friend, Pragya, who is probably trying to get back at me for some horrible thing I did but am unaware of, convinced me to. :) :)This book is so terrible and I feel like I probably shouldn\u2019t be rating it, since it\u2019s not targeted towards me, but,  it\u2019s just so  bad.  The main character is the most annoying character I\u2019ve ever read. The only thing she talks about it:1.\tHer nose2.\tBoys3.\tHow her friends are losers4.\tHer nose5.\tAnd how her life sucks so much, she wants to dieI\u2019ve never seen a fourteen-year old act like this, this is a terrible representation of teenagers, y\u2019all should be  ashamed! And the humour felt so  forced.  It wasn\u2019t even funny.  How do people like this book???!!! And WHY is there 10 books in the series???!! TEN BOOKS???!!!So . . . I\u2019m sorry if you\u2019re offended, or if this book was your early teenage happiness but the only reason I wrote such a terrible review was for the crazy coffee lover I mentioned earlier. So there, I hope you\u2019re happy, you\u2019ve made me do a terrible thing.  \u201cI suppose this is what life will be like for me\u2014never having a boyfriend, always just living through others\u201d 1 star!!"}, {"userName": "Megan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/150110-megan", "userReview": "Hillariosity! This is another book, from the brits, that people either love or hate. I happen to love this series, and laughed so hard I actually cried. I think people who hate this book are turned off by the main character Georgia. She is vain, self centered, hormonal, ridiculous and, I think, absolutely fabulous. This is the first of a series and we are introduced to her mad little sister libby, her feral cat Angus, her Mum and Dad, and group of silly girlfriends. It's written as a diary and a lot of people like to compare it to Bridget Jones. I have never read Bridget Jones so I can't really comment on that. I can however say that I took this book with me on a trip and illicited many curious glances from strangers in the airport.

Based on the recommendation from several friends who loved this, I picked this up when I saw it at a library sale, and I figured that now was a good time to read it since I'd just read a duo of emotionally traumatizing books and needed something light and fun after that. But this, aside from having a few funny moments, was mostly a 14 year old selfish angst-fest. If I was that annoying as a 14 year old, I think I may have to nominate my parents for sainthood for not murdering me. I got so bored with it by the middle that I ended up skimming most of the second half. Drama, boys, makeup, snotty fucking \"sense of humor\" and cattiness. Thank god I'm not a teenager anymore. I wasn't a fan of the style of this book either. It was written in journal format, but as is often the case, it ends up being mostly 1st person. But being that Miss Georgia is a drama queen, I can forgive that. She'd want to pour her heart out. But damn it was choppy and random and the timestamps didn't make sense. I think a lot of them were supposed to be funny, like \"Oh, I'm going to do this thing and it's going to make me look like a fashion model and then the Sex God will love me!\" and then 2 minutes later, \"My life is ruined!\" Ha ha ha.

I'm not an easy touch for this type of humor - slapstick and outrageous. ATFFS, however, made me laugh so hard, I snorted. The epistolary nature of the narrative adds so much to the plot. A snippet about a girl who accidentally-on-purpose shaves off her eyebrows is cringingly amusing, but when it's told in five or six installments, each a few minutes apart, and that snippet weaves itself through the rest of the narrative in little comments like, \"No news on the eyebrow front,\" there's no way to avoid laughing until your stomach aches. The fact of the matter is that Georgia is a tragic hero. You couldn't laugh so much if there wasn't something inherently tragic about her inability to enjoy life and admit it. She throws herself into frays in which it is obvious that she will be destroyed, and we cheer her on because she keeps trying. Georgia is who we want to be, because she succeeds through ridiculous perseverance. Read it and laugh, because weeping isn't far behind."}, {"userName": "Ellis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10165983-ellis", "userReview": "10:34 amI feel like yelling at him. \"I am fourteen years old, Uncle Eddie!

Although critically acclaimed and with awards to its name (http://www.harpercollins.com/books/An...) I would personally re-title this book \"Diary of a Petty, Shallow Tween.\"Now, don't misunderstand me. I laughed out loud at portions of the story, and most definitely felt as if I was reading the actual diary of quite a few of the tweens and young teens I work with regularly. However I would argue that the narrative is a reflection of a popular perception, but in reality a narrow representation of \"tweendome\" as we know it today.Set in England (with a glossary in the back for us \"American-type chums\"), the character of Georgia Nicolson can be summed up in the following quotes:1. \"I have no friends. Not one single friend. No one has rung, no one has come around...I may as well be dead.\"2. \"I love my life! Jas has just phoned to say we've been invited to a party...\"3. \"the only way I will believe in God is if something really bloody great happens to me soon.\"The emotional rollercoaster of a protagonist alternates between highs and lows, detests her family most of the time, is obsessed with boys and \"snogging\" (aka \"kissing\" -- even to the point of visiting a professional snogger in order to learn the art) and is completely self-absorbed in an immature, comedic way.Which, in reality, does describe the life of a typical tween. However, although every tween girl surely does experience these emotions and will be able to identify with the character, the extreme level of Georgia's shallowness will frustrate many. Young girls with socially conservative or religious backgrounds (who see relationships between the opposite sex as a serious matter, not something to be traded around like a baseball card), or girls who are involved in sports, the arts and academics (giving them a goal to strive for rather than finding their identity solely in their popularity) may not enjoy this book.Over-all, a good look into the life of a tween, being an enthralling read for tweens that may identify, and the laugh-out-loud hilarity give it high marks, but there are also tweens (and parents) who may strongly dislike the loose morals and shallowness of the main character."}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "Terrific light reading.

Our heroine, Georgia Nicolson, may be British, and a good 32 years my junior, but I too was Georgia...once upon a time.I laughed out loud, I snorted, I chuckled and I generally made such an arse of myself that I managed to annoy my daughter in the privacy of our living room. Georgia would surely have thought me a wally prat, and she wouldn't be off the mark.In short, \"Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging\" pokes sarcastic fun of all that it is to be young, insecure and 14, but does so in a way that leaves you no doubt that Rennison remembers, understands and celebrates girl-dom.

I can't think of anything to say about this book other than it's hilarious, refreshing, and amazing. Recommended to anyone who has a sense of humor or wishes they did."}, {"userName": "Roshani Chokshi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26262898-roshani-chokshi", "userReview": "One of my favorite series! In middle school, I had to take a Sharpie to my copy of ON THE BRIGHT SIDE, I'M NOW THE GIRLFRIEND OF A SEX GOD and mark out \"SEX\" so I wouldn't be mortified reading at the dinner table. However, Rennison is so funny that I snorted my food and mortification was inevitable."}], "description": "There are six things very wrong with my life:1. I have one of those under-the-skin spots that will never come to a head but lurk in a red way for the next two years.2. It is on my nose3. I have a three-year-old sister who may have peed somewhere in my room.4. In fourteen days the summer hols will be over and then it will be back to Stalag 14 and Oberfuhrer Frau Simpson and her bunch of sadistic teachers.5. I am very ugly and need to go into an ugly home.6. I went to a party dressed as a stuffed olive.In this wildly funny journal of a year in the life of Georgia Nicolson, British author Louise Rennison has perfectly captured the soaring joys and bottomless angst of being a teenager. In the spirit of Bridget Jones's Diary, this fresh, irreverent, and simply hilarious book will leave you laughing out loud. As Georgia would say, it's \"Fabbity fab fab!\"", "title": "Angus, Thongs and Full-Frontal Snogging\n      \n          (Confessions of Georgia Nicolson #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402013.Angus_Thongs_and_Full_Frontal_Snogging", "average": 3.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1400533444l/402013.jpg", "reviews": 3981, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/65189.Louise_Rennison", "name": "Louise Rennison"}], "type": ["Young Adult", "Humor", "Fiction", "Womens Fiction", "Romance"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402013.Angus_Thongs_and_Full_Frontal_Snogging", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8286130-angus-thongs-and-full-frontal-snogging", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112658.Angus_Thongs_And_Full_Frontal_Snogging", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/563712.Angus_Thongs_and_Full_Frontal_Snogging", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112656.Angus_Thongs_and_Full_Frontal_Snogging", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/864759.Angus_Thongs_and_Full_Frontal_Snogging", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17824640-angus-thongs-and-full-frontal-snogging", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402014.On_the_Bright_Side_I_m_Now_the_Girlfriend_of_a_Sex_God", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112675.Knocked_Out_by_My_Nunga_Nungas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/402015.Dancing_in_My_Nuddy_Pants", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/112693.Then_He_Ate_My_Boy_Entrancers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/347577.Away_Laughing_on_a_Fast_Camel"]}
