I'm a foodie, I write about foodies, so I liked that there was a teenage book about being a foodie (even if Stella's more about Burger King than haute cuisine). The one thing I stuggled with in the book were all the popular culture references. Not that I didn't know them, just that I don't think they'll be relevant in a few years when I recommend my niece read this book. (Even though it's quite cute, I still recommend it for slightly older teens, like 16+) I understand the want to make it relevant to teens today, but I also didn't think it really needed most of the references. But other than that, I enjoyed the book and the characters."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1194022-mary", "userReview": "Have been wanting to read this local author of YA fiction.

She does not know much about cooking and it always intrigue her when she sometimes sees her father making a fuss on getting a dish prepared, in which he would reply that cooking is a form of art and it should be taken seriously. Unlike Stella's father, Stella's mother is not much of a cook but she helps to ensure the restaurant is running and also to keep tabs on the financials even though they are separated. However, they still maintain an amicable relationship and sometimes this makes Stella wonder about them. But that is not all to it, Stella has a devoted boyfriend and he has said the big L-word to her. Stella knew she should be thrilled over Max's confession, after all he is adorable and she gets along well with his family, but she is not so sure about committing herself since she has other things on her mind: her parents' separation and the summer internship at the local newspaper. To make things more complex, she is attracted to Jeremy, a new intern who works in the restaurant and she is seeing him more than Max, not that she could help it considering she has to write articles on food and she needs his opinions since he knew much more than her. So how does Stella cope with all these issues thrown in her way? Though she struggles to find a balance (or a solution, depending on how one views it), it is through this stage that she began to understand more about her life as it helps her to appreciate her family and understand the true meaning of friendship through the things that happened to her. The Sweet Life of Stella Madison is a fun, entertaining story about family, friendship and food. I love reading a story surrounding food and this is one reason why I picked up this book, besides the pretty cover that is. I think most teenagers would be able to understand and feel for Stella, after all life is not a bed of roses and sometimes, we have to make a choice and accept it no matter how much we like it or loathe it. In the beginning, I was not sure if I like Stella because she seems unpredictable to me; she gave me the impression she does not know what she wants in life and she is wishy-washy of her feelings towards her boyfriend. But as I read further, it made me think that most of us have gone through those stages before, but with different situations and scenarios, that is all. One of the things I loved is each chapter begins with a list of food (just like the way you view at a menu that starts with appetizer, main course, dessert etc) and speaking of food, it reminds me of The School of Essential Ingredients which is one of my favourite reads this year. It is a sheer delight reading these books as you wonder about the food mentioned."}, {"userName": "Yan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 10, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1350957-yan", "userReview": "Summary: \u201cIt\u2019s not easy being the daughter of a famous chef and a restaurant owner when your idea of a great meal is the kind that\u2019s served via a drive-through window.Seventeen-year-old Stella Madison\u2019s food-loving parents have been separated for years, but they\u2019re still as sweet to each other as can be, which is just the way Stella likes it. When their connections help her land a summer job at the local newspaper, the salary is hard to resist. There\u2019s only one catch: she\u2019s expected to write about food.Now Stella will need all the advice she can get to complete her assignments. Luckily, she has Jeremy, the hot new intern at her mom\u2019s restaurant, who\u2019s more than happy to help. Soon, Stella can\u2019t stop thinking about Jeremy\u2014but where does that leave Stella\u2019s boyfriend, Max, who recently dropped the L-word? If that\u2019s not confusing enough, her dad\u2019s interest in the pretentious programming director of the Food Network seems to go beyond the culinary, and it looks like her mother might be cooking up a romance of her own\u2026.\u201dReview: This book is as sweet as the title plays off. I\u2019m a food junkie who thinks that a marathon of Food Network Challenges is heaven. So of course when you give me a book about food it\u2019s like a perfect match!This food for thought can be a double-edged sword. Readers who are not familiar with certain foods and food terms will most likely be lost in the little details. Although Stella\u2019s palette aims toward fast food and street food, the heavy menus from restaurants will be mind-boggling. Viewers of Bravo\u2019s Top Chef, however, will feel right at home. The author does aid the readers with a small scene on how to properly consume (excuse me, I mean taste) food and the preparations of the perfect gnocchi.Stella Madison is a teen that describes herself as a rubber ball bouncing in any direction; she has no sense of what she wants, she rolls with what\u2019s given to her. So when she meets Jeremy, Max is suddenly out of her mind only to reappear when the guilt comes crawling back. Some might find Stella fickle with her whine, whine, whine about what she got herself into\u2014Jeremy or Max? For some odd reason I did not find this true at all. I\u2019m blaming on the writing. There\u2019s a fine line where I felt that the author stayed within the realistic and coming-of-age story. This is Stella growing up and trying to tackle that rubber ball effect. The whole book had a sense of cuteness, humor, and compassion. It deals with heartbreak, divorce, and a sexy European intern. Overall: Food lovers and book lovers, pick up a copy of this book!"}, {"userName": "Aria", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3963131-aria", "userReview": "Rating: 3.5 StarsSummary:Stella Madison is the daughter of food-obsessed parents who are separated but not divorced. When her parents begin to show interest in other people, Stella struggles to accept that her parents truly are not in love anymore. To add to the conflict, Stella's boyfriend has just professed his love for her and she is unsure whether she feels the same way. Also, her mom has hired a cute older intern who she is interested in. The sweet life of Stella Madison just got a little complicated.Characters:Stella- I have mixed feelings about Stella. Most of the time, I had good feelings for her. I appreciated the fact that she wasn't exactly ready for the I-love-you stage of her relatonship with Max. I found her to be annoying when she flirted with Jeremy (I mean HELLO!, you have a boyfriend!) I also felt that she could be a bit selfish at times, but I guess that is a pretty normal trait. Overall, Stella was a very convincing and real character. I loved her weather predicting hair :)Jeremy- Surprisingly, I didn't care for Jeremy that much and I didn't miss him when he wasn't mentioned. I didn't necessarily not like him, I just didn't specifically like him. He was very generic, in my opinion.Max-I didn't have any more feelings for Max than I did for Jeremy. Throughout the book, I was Team Max, but he wasn't my dream guy. I liked him, but only slighly more than Jeremy.Olivia and Kat- These two were by far my favorite charcters, especially Olivia. What I liked the most about them was that they were really good friends to Stella.Plot- The plot was pretty slow, but it was interesting enough that I kept reading. The romance was lacking for me considering that I didn't really like either of the male love interets.Cover- I love the bright colors against the white background.

Stella is your typical teenager going through typical teenage struggles. I liked how the author makes these struggles relatable, but I think that she tried to do too much and some things got overshadowed. One thing that got overshadowed was Stella\u2019s internship. I really wanted more of Stella's experiences as an intern. I know that wasn't really what the story was about, but this is was one the most interesting parts of the book. I wasn\u2019t completely in love with this book, but I continued reading because I was hoping for more of Stella\u2019s restaurant reviews. I think that Zeises should have fleshed out this part of the story and scaled back or downplayed some of Stella\u2019s other struggles.I appreciated Stella\u2019s struggle to use the \u201cL\u201d word with her boyfriend. I think this is an important issue that teens are struggling with nowadays. The use of \u201cLOVE\u201d has become so common place; teens are rushing into using it in their relationships without thinking about its true meaning. I\u2019m glad that Stella struggled with it; it shows teens that you shouldn\u2019t use it unless you\u2019re ready. Stella\u2019s commitment issues, thanks to her parents\u2019 confusing six year separation, contributes to her rushing into telling Max that she loves him without really meaning it and in the end she hurts him because she wasn\u2019t really ready.Ultimately this was a pretty good book, but it could have been better in places. Stella learns a lot through her struggles, some of them were hard lessons to learn, but necessary. I think most teenagers would be able to relate to and feel for Stella, after all life\u2019s not easy and sometimes, teenagers don\u2019t make the best decisions or handle situations well."}, {"userName": "Bella Grace", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7859888-bella-grace", "userReview": "Reading books like these make me ponder the universally unanswered answer: why the heck'd I even pick this up?I gave this book a go because I was in the library, my mum was waiting in the car and I needed another book. Just so I would not be bored at home. Well, I did myself wrong as a result. This book was an icky, boring, exasperating hot mess. I, very literally, wanted to stab multiple characters at various times. I'm not going to waste my breath - I expected nothing less. But sometimes, as a young reader, giving some books a try despite expecting failure is something you must do. You got a lifetime of reading to do, and you might as well use it. But this book just made me want to bang my head repeatedly against the wall. So I did just that. That is how utterly stupid this book is. Stella is a stuffy, unappreciative little bitch who despite having a boyfriend, crushes over her mom's hot new intern and is too childish to get over the fact that her parents' relationship is fucking over. Frankly, it's characters like her that make me detest YA sometimes. And I did try to connect to Stella, feel sorry for her situation and sympathize. I just fucking couldn't. Who would want to listen to this whiny bitch? Anyway, that is all. Seriously. If you want to avoid your brain cells from burning up, please avoid this book.

I thought her relationships and feelings toward them were very realistic and well-written.I liked her friends and was glad to see that she had two such close friends-a lot of times YA novels seem to skimp on the female friendship front (Alliteration!)

Though I wouldn't say I enjoyed it 100% or that I liked Stella's boy-crazy character very much, the book still brought a great message for teen girls: it's okay to be friends with guys. Or in other words, you don't have to make every guy your boyfriend because technically, crushes don't last. With the help of Jeremy, Stella learns what love really means and that with maturity, comes love. Not only did these lessons about love weave around Stella, but her parents as well, giving the story an even greater depth.

I had a great time reading it. But seriously, this book will make you hungry! I found the foundation of food this story had rather unique. From the dinner menus at the beginning of chapters to how to order food when eating for the purpose of a review or even really tasting food for the first time. All those pieces are there.I really liked reading about Stella's summer internship at the newspaper. I only wish she had started it sooner into the story. I feel like she just really got going there and it was over. I would have liked that to be a bigger part of the story.I loved the character of Jeremy, Stella's mother's young intern. What a charmer, but he really understood Stella I felt. I felt bad for Stella's loving boyfriend, Max, who was oblivious to Stella's crush on Jeremy.

At the beginning, Stella has a serious boyfriend named Max who says something to her that changes their relationship. She thinks about what he said, when all of a sudden there is a new intern at her parents restaurant. His name is Jeremy and eventually she is stuck in a love triangle. This book is filled with events where you want to keep reading to know what someones actions will be. Stella comes across many new obstacles throughout the book. The decisions she makes and the problems that occur can relate to many teens in the real world. Such as her parents being separated and starting to date other people. The decisions she chooses, can make a reader wonder if it's the right decision and/or why she decided that.

Oh well."}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2836923-jay", "userReview": "I liked this but I felt like it didnt have enough conflict and/or what conlfict there was came too little too late. There were only about 30 pages left when the true conflict finally comes to a head and its all neatly and easily resolved. I also found it frustrating/unrealistic that Stella never got in real trouble for anything she did. Go AWOL with bf all day? Steal liquor and get drunk? All she ever really got a was a quick talking to. I enjoyed this but thought there was too much time spent leading up to an underwhelming denouement."}, {"userName": "Gwen the Librarian", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/275552-gwen-the-librarian", "userReview": "Stella Madison is a teenage girl whose parents are famous foodies, but she is a devotee of fast food. When she is given an internship at the newspaper to write restaurant reviews, Stella is mortified both because she doesn't actually like fancy food and because she fears she won't know what to write. Add to the mix her parents' tumultuous relationship and her own indecisiveness between her too-sweet boyfriend and the hot intern at her mom's restaurant and you have a perfect recipe for a fun summer read."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/376717-heather", "userReview": "This is one of those books that I really wish I could give three and half stars. It was really cute and good, but what I really wanted were more of Stella's experiences as an intern. She kind of fell into the position and was very good it, but after her first review/interview, we don't learn anything else about it. I know that wasn't really what the story line was about, but I kind of wanted it to be.Give this to your foodie fans in middle school.

The summer of Stella's junior year of high school, she has boys, friends, and buying a car on her mind. When she supplements working in her mother's open-kitchen restaurant with writing restaurant reviews for the local paper, life becomes much more complicated. As does her mother's new intern. As a character, Stella is believable and likeable, though the supporting cast is more of a mix of fleshed-out characters and two-dimensional character-types. It's fun to read a foodie book with a teen audience."}], "description": "It's not easy being the daughter of a famous chef and a resteraunt owner when your idea of a great meal is the kind that's served through via a drive-through window. When Stella Madison's food-loving parents help her land a summer job at the local newspaper, there\u2019s only one catch: she\u2019s expected to write about food. Luckily, Stella has Jeremy, the hot new intern at her mom\u2019s restaurant, who\u2019s more than happy to help. But where does that leave Stella\u2019s boyfriend, Max, who recently dropped the L-word?
