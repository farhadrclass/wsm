I felt the writer was trying way too hard to be funny and as a result, the whole thing just fell flat. The plot, such as it was, would circle miles out of the way to set up a joke that didn't even make me smile.The basics are here--the evil stepmother, Snow White, the mother wishing for a child fitting Snow White's description...I guess that's about it. There were tons of other fairy- and folk tale creatures dragged in by the skin of their teeth, which I should have loved, but I didn't. I mostly didn't see any rhyme or reason for who was included and who wasn't. I honestly can't even remember what happened to most of them.Snow White was super annoying. I believe that was kind of the point, but man, she set my teeth on edge. She's supposed to be about fifteen but she's voiced by Sandra Oh, who is at least as far from fifteen as I am, and she generally acts about two years old. Temper tantrums? Seriously? Not attractive or enjoyable.I could go on but I won't. I'm sure there's an audience for this, I just don't know who it would be. If you're interested, don't let me dissuade you from trying it out; at two hours long, you don't have much to lose."}, {"userName": "Cindi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5730733-cindi", "userReview": "2.5 rounded up. This wasn't horrible. Based on some of the reviews, I was a bit afraid. But it was offered for free download from the library and I love fairy tales & retellings, so I thought I'd take a chance. I can't say it's on my top 10 favorites list, or that I would exactly remember or recommend it to a friend, but it was entertaining and actually very well performed.The blend of different fairy tales was interesting as well. If not for the implied sex and the king's bedroom scene, I'd suggest it to my daughter. But although not explicit, I don't feel like it is appropriate for her age."}, {"userName": "Missy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/63990928-missy", "userReview": "I would have given this a 5 star review but I thought at time there was way too much going on so it was hard to follow.

When the first word out of Gretchen's mouth was \"Shit!\" I knew I would like this book. And when the Duke used \"vomitorium\" in his death/marriage speak, I knew I would really, really like it. It's about 2 1/2 hours, has a full cast and includes the cheesy sound effects you find in old radio programs. Snow White's voice was a bit too whiny, which was unfortunate, but the other voices were great. And there is a crazy amount of fairy tale variety. The girl that spins straw into gold is in there. Snow White lives in the cabin of the seven dwarfs but shares it with Rumplestiltskin. Hansel and Gretel have a cameo, as does the witch's candy house. A genie in a bottle grants Snow White's wishes. This book has terrible reviews so I seem to be the odd man out but I thought it was funny. It was a quick listen with quirky appeal."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25674152-terri", "userReview": "The Carol Burrnett Show for your Ears (Audiobook)ROFLWTIME (for those non-internet slang users: Rolling on the Floor laughing with tears in my eyes) from the start. Don't expect to find the anything remotely resembling \"Snow White a Tale of Terror\". This reminded me more of a Vaudeville show or one of the Carol Burnett Show skits that gets slightly out of hand as Tim Conway & Harvey Korman start alibiing.This is the book to read if you are feeling blue and need something to cheer you up or for about any other reason. Yuri Rasovsky spins a unique take on the classic Snow White fairy tale story with a few other fairy tales thrown in for fun.

In this version of the story, Snow White is a bit of a slut! I very much enjoyed this audiobook. It was more like an old fashioned radio show than an audiobook, with several different actors playing various parts and the use of foley artists. I have never heard an audiobook quite like this one. Various fairy tale characters appear in the novel, including Hansel and Gretel, Goldilocks and the three bears, as well as Rumplestilskin. just a wonderful mature fairytale."}, {"userName": "Natalie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27331835-natalie", "userReview": "Yeah... it was fun, but if you're looking for a good fairy tale retelling, OR actual plot or depth- move on. Quickly. Basically- the only redeeming quality for this, is the vocal talent. A full cast of mostly celebrity voices make it a fun listen. The horrible pronunciations of German words (although some of the cast did try), the sketchy and shallow plot, and the supposedly funny, but isn't racial generalizations make for a tiresome listen.

Let me start by saying I listened to the Audio Book version of this on my way home during a 4 and a half hour trip, and it was a big distraction because it pretty much was like listening to a movie.

The acting is sometimes a little over the top, but the outlandishness works well with the bizarre and silly script. A great time passer.

I found this QUITE amusing.It requires a certain passing knowledge of not just Disney versions of fairy tales like Snow White and Rumplestiltskin, but also the classic versions.It also has quite a bit of swearing and adult content (read sexual innuendo)So... with that in mind, I found the performances in this tale quite fun!"}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3052319-heather", "userReview": "It was entertaining enough and it reminded me of a play - which I guess is kind of what it was going for - but I wouldn't go out of my way to listen to it. They brought together a lot of fairtales, not just Snow White so it was an interesting take. The actors were over dramatic (as they are in plays) and the music was corny (as they usually are in plays) and some of the humour seemed forced.

First of all, it was slightly disconnected, like I started in the middle and then missed something toward the end.

I also like the way several Grimm stories were used in parts (Rumplestiltskin, Hansel and Gretel, etc). On the whole, however, it just didn't appeal to me.
