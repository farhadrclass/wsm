In a nutshell, we've got an African American cowboy gunslinger-turned-author who's the only man standing between salvation and the utter destruction of the planet from zombies from space terrorizing a Mississippi backwater. But unlike the bargain-budget space-horror movies from the 1950's, Black Redneck vs Space Zombies is good. Actually, really good.This is going to sound ironic, but the book is both a quick read and a slow read at the same time. It's a quick read because the action is tight and the chapters short. As a result, the reader can breeze through large swathes of text in what feels like no time. This speaks to the author's admirable skill at keeping his audience engaged. That said, the book is also a slow read because the plot takes roughly half the book to set up. A lot needs to happen before we get to see what we came for, but the payoff is worth it. Before the halfway mark in the book, we learn plenty about Jefferson Balladeer (the titular character), and get a smattering of sci-fi, but nothing actually resembling zombies, whether from space or otherwise. Jefferson is the self-styled \"Black Redneck.\" We learn how he grew up in the Mississippi backwoods and left for good when he became an adult, returning only to attend to the final affairs of his recently deceased brother.But that's only half of the equation: with a title like \"Black Redneck vs Space Zombies,\" one expects to see some zombies (and a fair amount of sci-fi, given the \"Space\" part). As if on cue for the book's second act, zombies start to make their appearance in the latter half of the book -- and are they ever horrifying. They're not zombies in the traditional sense of shambling brain-eaters. They're fast and effective pack hunters working together with a coordinated hive-mind. Terrible as they are, they pale in comparison to the tentacled Lovecraftian monster that's churning them out.Endearing characters, fantastic gunplay, witty quips of dialogue and narration, and a stallion that's smarter than the average horse make for a whirlwind of a story you don't want to miss. And zombies. Lots and lots of zombies.As an aside, the latter half of the title sounds like it may have been inspired by a classic song by the Misfits, \"Astro Zombies.\" That's just my speculation, but I couldn't help but think that."}, {"userName": "Shana Festa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9185553-shana-festa", "userReview": "I must say, I've never read anything quite like this.

What an exciting, emotional ride!I\u2019ll start with Jefferson, the black redneck. He, of course, is our loveable hero. I mean, who wouldn\u2019t love a black guy raised in the Deep South who ends up being a rodeo winning child prodigy? He is by far the most interesting book character I\u2019ve ever met. He is likeable, even with his mistakes that he realizes is too late to make right.Adopted by a white family as an infant, he cured them of their \u201cprejudice, not KKK prejudice, but, you know, the regular sort.\u201d Because, it seems, \u201cprejudice is no match for love.\"Okay, I admit it, that chapter put a lump in my throat and made me tear up. But there were plenty of laughable and fun moments, too.Each of the characters has their own story, and they are all full of life. From the foul-mouthed and sassy six-year-old Mary, whose feet are black because she never wears shoes, to the quiet Pearl, who faints at the slightest sign of trouble. Imagine what happens when she comes face to face with space zombies.The flow of this book works well, with only one exception: the flashbacks. I don\u2019t mind that they are there. They are even placed at the right spot so that we glean just the right amount of information to know exactly what is going on in the characters\u2019 heads - past and present. My only issue is that they are too in your face. Instead of announcing, \u201cSTART FLASHBACK\u201d and \u201cEND FLASHBACK,\u201d I would have appreciated them being a tad more subtle. However, that is my only issue with the book, aside from a handful of grammatical errors, which seems to be the norm in any published book.I gave this book 4.5 stars, which I rounded up to 5, simply because it was so much fun to read! And I want more. Steven Roy wrapped up the story nicely, but I see potential for a sequel.If you love aliens, zombies, or, hell, even cowboys - or a combination of any of those - you've got to read this book! You won't be disappointed.\u00a0I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review.\u00a0[I originally read this book in January 2014. I am in the process of transferring my blog contents.]"}, {"userName": "J.

The characters were likeable, the jokes were plentiful, and the action was nonstop. The zombies in this book weren\u2019t like any other zombies that I\u2019ve read about. They\u2019re actually aliens that take over human bodies, rather than humans that get infected by a virus. The Devourer is a massive alien that destroys worlds by consuming all living beings in its path. When the Devourer destroys the spaceship that\u2019s holding it prisoner, it plunges toward earth with one other alien who survived the blast. After crashing through the atmosphere, the Devourer lands in Picayune, Mississippi.Meanwhile, Jefferson Balladeer (the Black Redneck) has returned to Picayune to attend his brother\u2019s funeral. Jefferson left Picayune when he was just seventeen years old, leaving his southern roots behind to become a successful author. He is reluctant to go back to his southern ways, so he distances himself from his old neighbors. But he\u2019s forced to relive his cowboy days when the Devourer takes over the woods behind his house.There are also some moral lessons in this book. Most importantly, you should never turn your back on friends and family. And, of course, don\u2019t forget your roots. I know it\u2019s rare to find positive messages in zombie books, but this one is quite uplifting. If you\u2019re a fan of zombies, aliens, or southern folk, then I highly recommend that you pick up a copy of Black Redneck vs. Space Zombies."}, {"userName": "Lisa Hall", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4927202-lisa-hall", "userReview": "I never expected to cry while reading this, but I did and a few chapters later laughed my ass off.

I\u2019ve got redneck covered.\u201d Don\u2019t worry, it will make perfect sense when you get to it.BR vs SZ has a quirky style reminiscent of script writing that fits the subject matter and tone of the book, but is definitely not a standard novel approach. The characters are well drawn and unforgettable; even the horse has personality and I cheered for Mary and Tom. When it comes to imagination, I give this story an eleven on a ten scale for the inclusion of a non-bipedal alien with a fully developed life cycle. Kudos.I\u2019m not wild about split story lines, but the aliens held my interest and the locals were people we\u2019ve all met somewhere so I stuck with it. Most of the book managed a humorous tone without being ridiculous and balanced it with Jefferson Balladeer\u2019s story that was personal and touching. This wasn\u2019t a title that I normally would have picked up but I\u2019m glad I did."}, {"userName": "March McCarron", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21826505-march-mccarron", "userReview": "Here\u2019s a sentence I never thought I\u2019d utter: I just read a book entitled Black Redneck vs. Space Zombies and, at one point, I cried\u2014actual tears! While not a perfect book, the unexpected gems this story offer make it very much worth reading. The Story:Black Redneck vs. Space Zombies is the story of Jefferson Belladeer, an African American adopted and raised by self-proclaimed rednecks in Mississippi. As a youth, he embraced the redneck culture and, with the guidance of the big brother who raised him, became a rodeo star and all-around badass. However, upon discovering that his adoptive father had once been a racist, he rejects his family and friends, his childhood town, and all of his redneck interests. It takes the death of that brother to bring him home and force him to once again question just who he is. While he handles the selling of his brother\u2019s property, a visitor from space takes up residence in his woods. And when a group of partying teens become an army of space zombies, Jefferson must once again rely on his redneck skill set to stay alive.The Writing:I very much enjoyed the writing, which was generally of a high quality. Roy has a real knack for using metaphors that are both vivid and funny (the chapter titles, too, are often funny). The dialogue is also consistently strong, especially the use of dialect. Right from the start, Roy creates a strong sense of setting and character, and does so with a light touch, not slowing down his story with tedious exposition. There are a spattering of typos and passages where frequent word repetition steals some of the music from the prose, but these were the minority.What I Loved:My favorite part of this book had nothing to do with zombies. Jefferson\u2019s struggle with his identity was absolutely fascinating. As I said, I shed a few tears as Jefferson came to realize that, race aside, his redneck family had loved him. There were so many characters along the way that were far more complex and lovable than one would expect from a book that, on the surface, seems like mindless fun. Even Jefferson\u2019s horse had personality. I don\u2019t always like the use of flashbacks because I often find them to be lazy storytelling, but the flashbacks in this book were an absolute joy and gave the protagonist so much more depth. Of course, the story culminates with some pretty cool action scenes, but all of this emotional build up rendered those scenes far more significant: Jefferson being a badass redneck, riding a horse and shooting a huge gun, isn\u2019t just cool to visualize, it\u2019s his way of reconnecting with his brother and his childhood. Awesome. What I didn\u2019t Love:My primary issue with Black Redneck vs. Space Zombies was the space zombie half of the equation. The story is told very much like movie, which, for me, was a weakness. In a monster movie, you expect the quick scenes of the monster to be intercut with the setup. It works in such a format. However, this same technique doesn\u2019t necessarily work in a book. You see, the story was wonderful when it was about Jefferson and the other citizen of Picayune, but when it switched to the space monster or aliens the plot movement was so obvious and there were no characters for me to care about, so I was bored. It made for an inconstant reading experience. I\u2019d get: interesting Jefferson scene, monster eats a squirrel, interesting Jefferson flashback, monster eats a deer, and so on. Once the action comes to a head this becomes a nonissue, but for the first half of the book it made for a very choppy experience.So, while I did find the overall book a bit inconsistent, when it\u2019s good it is really very good. For anyone who is interested in reading something a bit different I\u2019d recommend checking this book out. Oh, yeah, and the cover artwork is stinking awesome."}, {"userName": "Fangs for the Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912634-fangs-for-the-fantasy", "userReview": "Jefferson has to return home from his new successful life he has built for himself as a successful author. And he\u2019s not very happy about it.His childhood home is the small, rural town of Piacyune, Mississippi and he\u2019s spent a long time denying he had any part of it \u2013 or the skills and persona he once adopted there. The locals aren\u2019t too pleased with his return either and he has a lot of demons to fight.He also has aliens to fight \u2013 the Devourer, a giant, jelly-fish monstrosity scarfing down catfish and turning people into zombies. And he thought locals opposing his property development and trespassing teenagers were the worst he\u2019d have to deal with.Ok, when I was sent this book I have to admit I looked at the title and said \u201cyou have got to be kidding me?!\u201dBut I\u2019ve been surprised by terribly titled books before and I read the text around it and thought I might be surprised. So I accepted, I read it and fully prepared to unleash the snark I was halfway certain I would need to review this book.I am glad I gave it the chance. There will be no snark. This book was astonishingly deep and nuanced with many shades of characterisation and oppression.Jefferson, the protagonist is a Black man raised in a predominantly White area of the rural south of the US; he was adopted by a White family and, when his adoptive parents died he was left in the care of his not particularly bright (but very caring) brother.He faced racism \u2013 a considerable amount in fact \u2013 as you\u2019d expect. It was well presented, from several sources and always made clear to be unacceptable. It wasn\u2019t covered up or dismissed and it wasn\u2019t sanitised \u2013but nor was it presented in cartoonish, exaggerated sense with lots of melodrama and monologue milked out for every last iota of tortured-protagonist angst. It was an excellent, balanced presentation.There was also a wonderfully nuanced depiction of well meaning, but short sighted liberal people in this place encouraging Jefferson, as a child to be whatever he wanted to be \u2013 and like many children who idolise their big brothers he says \u201cI want to be a redneck like my brother\u201d. Cue the liberal teacher both wanting to encourage him to achieve something more academic since he\u2019s so intelligent \u2013 and not wanting to tell the only Black boy in her class that there\u2019s a career he CANNOT do.There\u2019s a whole lot of nuance in the depiction. And this becomes more complex when we go on to an adult Jefferson who has left this tiny little rural town in the south and moved north to the big city and he\u2019s a super successful author. He returns home for important non-spoiler-so-I-won\u2019t-reveal reasons and his attitudes are very different. He has natural hostility for the racism he faced but there\u2019s also a huge stripe of contemptuous classism. He\u2019s ashamed of where he\u2019s from, he lies in his author biographies, he looks down on his old friends and neighbours and the way they live.Read More"}, {"userName": "Jada Ryker", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22078661-jada-ryker", "userReview": "Not Your Father's Zombie Book!Black Redneck vs. Space Zombies, by Steven Roy, is a colorful adventure. The characters are three-dimensional artistic creations, with the power to make you love them or hate them, but never ignore them or discount them. For example, Skeeter and Tater, meth manufacturers, made me want to crack their hard-headed skulls together. At the same time, I wanted to hug Old Ed and listen to his wisdom. Glen is a bully. His best friends are beer and television. The book also contains plenty of humor; a pile of fresh manure is an organic land mine.Reading this book is like going into a dark cave and stumbling across strewn diamonds. As well as an entertaining alien zombie read, the novel is brimming over with symbolism. One example involves Jefferson's childhood. As a child, Jefferson competed against a stranger, with a special horse as the prize. He lost. The owner gave him the horse anyway, and told him: \"In the old times, men of bravery were given horses, not just for what they had done, but to give them the opportunity for more bravery.\" The former owner of the horse said Jefferson was brave and very talented, which the horse also knew. He said Jefferson and the horse would do something very important one day.When Jefferson returns as an adult, the horse Gray Man tries to kill him. The symbolism is compelling. Over time as a city dweller, Jefferson had changed from the Black Redneck to a successful author. He had lost touch with his inner redneck.With a deft touch, Mr. Roy also deals with stereotypes, racism and child abuse. He brings a homespun, folksy touch to difficult topics, and he helps the reader see important messages while not standing on a soapbox.Black Redneck vs. Space Zombies would make an excellent graphic novel, movie, or television show.

In the spirit of low-budget, Friday night, monster B-movies - \"Black Redneck vs. Space Zombies\" is a fun and creative story that manages to elevate itself from its niche by adding a layer of thoughtful social commentary.I'll jump right to the elephant in the room - or rather the title. \"Black Redneck\" in no way trivializes or avoids its racial suggestions. \"Black Redneck\" is, in fact, a title of honor that represents the ability of the main character, Jefferson, to rise to a level of what is considered equality in his hometown. And racial equality is dealt with in an honest and genuine scene which I thought was the best in the whole story. It's not preachy, but simply shows how attitudes can be passed down through generations (intentionally or not) and that it's the duty of the older generation to break that chain of thought in the younger. It's not belabored and therefore effective.As for the story, its strength lies in the characters and dialog. The characters that need to be clear and strong are, and - in the tradition of the B-movie - there is a host of supplemental characters whose only purpose is to be fodder for the monster. The dialog between the characters is natural and smooth, with unique voices for each one that is very enjoyable to read.When the time comes for descriptive passages, the prose tends to get over saturated with similes and repetitive words. An experienced editor would help to focus and streamline those passages as well as catch the handful of typos (and make this an unqualified 5 out of 5).However, the fun, boisterous plot and excellent character development far overshadow any weakness. If you get why I mentioned the Toxic Avenger in the title, or just like a good monster yarn, then I recommend this story."}, {"userName": "Lita Burke", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7119160-lita-burke", "userReview": "Black Redneck vs. Space Zombies by Steven Roy is a sci-fi/fantasy featuring a modern day cowboy-turned-writer who battles an alien invasion in his backwoods.Jefferson Balladeer returns home to Picayune, Mississippi to attend the funeral of his adopted brother, Big Beau.

The characters are multi-dimensional and have completely seperate personalities which are easily liked and quickly, emotions are formed for those characters. That being said, the tale of Jefferson, alone, was highly predictable, nice and heart-warming, but predictable.The sci-fi elements to this novel are great, they are original, inventive and creepy as all get out!! Roy has created aliens/zombies that are gorgeously horrible and that is a breath of fresh air, from the normal, slow moving, dead person looking zombies, and from the stereotypical, big headed aliens, so in that aspect this novel is great.The plot is clear from the first few chapters, and that takes away from the novel slightly due to that predictability, only for the fact that the reader can work out how the novel is going to end, before it actually did, that being said, being taken along for the ride with the amazing characters Roy has created, makes that predictability seem un-important. This novel, at 300 pages, feels a lot shorter than that, once the action begins to run at full pace, and you will fly through it before you realise you have done it, a great and inventive novel, with courageous and perhaps a little eccentric characters, my favourite by far is Mary, so if you are going to read this, look out for her ;)A fun, fast paced read that deserves to be read, I gaurantee, even if this novel doesn't sound like it is for you, that you will like certain aspects about it, definetly is a novel for any YA reader or just anyone looking for something fresh and new within the Sci-fi-Zombie-Alien genre!"}, {"userName": "J.A.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27152438-j-a", "userReview": "I have to admit that when I saw this title, I cringed.

One of the things that I love most about this story is that Roy can tell an exciting adventure story,and do so without the need for graphic sex or violence. Now don't get me wrong, we have space zombies, tentacles and aliens, but Roy writes his tale in a style that lets you fill in the blanks. He hits that fine balance of showing you just enough to get your imagination sparked, without having to spell everything out in minute detail. Steven Roy doesn't go for the quick shock or the easy titillation. This tale is all meat and taters.The characterization was more than enough to get you invested into the heros and their plight. The plot moved along at a quick pace, never bogging down. This would have made a great drive in movie, and I think Jefferson Balladeer deserves his own film or tv show. This is a story that could be easily told in prime time.To me, it was money well spent, and this is a great book for a rainy afternoon.

The author has his way of getting the characters into your brain and making you love them (or feel sorry for them or hate them); it must be some sort of a space zombie hypnotic thing he learned from aliens.The Black Redneck, Jefferson, returns home after being away for 10 years to get it ready to sell after his brother dies and discovers that there\u2019s a mama alien living on the farm feeding on the animals and catfish, as well as creating new space zombies. Old Ed luckily had an arsenal of assault weapons hidden in his yard and Daisy, the game warden who has had a crush on the Black Redneck since Day 1, as well as neighbors and squirrel-hunting bare-footed siblings, six-year-old Mary and brother, Tom, help annihilate them, one by one. Mary becomes their leader when the \u201cnice\u201d alien robot Shorty injects her brain with vast knowledge of the universe but more importantly, knowledge on how to kill the alien zombies. She helps in the slaughter by accurately tossing grenades, and giving the order for everyone to \u201cFire! Kill that bitch!\u201d with their assorted weapons. Shorty, the robot alien even helps kill the mama alien (the Devourer) by releasing tiny little spider robots that were hidden in his mysterious canister, along with his expert \u201cspace kung fu postures,\u201d and his \u201cblack-belt-theatre-jump-spin,\u201d with his sword, which accurately kills three space zombies back-to-back by chopping off their heads.This story made me smile and laugh out loud, and I even felt sad a time or two. The love and tenderness between Jefferson and his horse he left behind on the farm, Gray Man, brought tears to my eyes and then I laughed when Gray Man \u201cplayed dead\u201d while sneaking a peek at his owner. The letter that Jefferson\u2019s brother wrote but never sent brought me to tears as well and that was when I had the \u201caha!\u201d moment about the story and a deeper understanding of Jefferson and his family.I loved the way the author uniquely describes different scenes: \u201cTom jumped forward and landed on Glen\u2019s back, like one of those guys at SeaWorld riding a killer whale.\u201d \u201cZombie Glen\u2019s leg poured blood as he shuffled toward her like a traditional zombie.\u201d \u201cKirby did a fist pump like he had just thrown the winning touchdown in the Super Bowl.\u201d Oh man, I could go on and on. But my favorite of all: \u201cThe beds of the pickups were loaded with fully armed rednecks. For the first time in the history of the universe, a black guy felt relief at such a sight.\u201dThe author uses creativity in his chapter headings too; no boring chapter numbers for this book: Mary Sees A Monster; Sexy Game Warden vs. Space Zombies; Daisy Ain\u2019t Dead Yet; You Can\u2019t Trust Aliens. Also the nicknames for people, objects and places, rock: Monster Anne, Zombie Glen, City Boy, Fort Awesome, Big Bang and Sweet Darling (homemade weapons).Seriously, I haven\u2019t had this much fun since watching Mystery Science Theatre 3000 back in the 90s. While there could have been more work done with the depth of the characters, I still give this entertaining story a 5-star review and after finishing it \u201cthe reviewer had arms in the air as if she had just won the million dollars in the Publisher\u2019s Clearing House Sweepstakes!\u201d"}, {"userName": "Sahara Foley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26086669-sahara-foley", "userReview": "The title of this book has everything to do with a great sci-fi zombie story and just a hint of racism. Jefferson Balladeer \u2019was adopted by a white redneck family and grew up wanting to be the first Black Redneck. At the age of seventeen, he is told a half truth about his adoption and leaves Picayune, Mississippi in a huff, never looking back, until his adopted brother dies ten years later. Jefferson comes back to handle the affairs and sell off the estate ASAP. He wants nothing to do with his hometown or the people he knew growing up. Unbeknownst to him, an alien life form, called the Devourer, has decided to take up residency on his land. Specifically in his catfish ponds. And so the battle begins.The plot is pretty straightforward for a hero battling monster story. The chapters are short and listed as quirky title names vs numbers; The Devourer Feeds On Birds. There are some flashback scenes, which Steven Roy clearly states are flashbacks. I\u2019m not sure if Steven did this on purpose, keeping in the theme of a B-rated movie, or he just didn\u2019t know how to segue from one scene to another.Most of the main characters are very compelling. The ones that stick out in my mind are Jefferson, Mary and Tom, and Gray Man and Old Ed. I thought Daisy\u2019s character could have been enhanced a bit, but the story is from a male perspective. Maybe he doesn\u2019t understand women that well. Oh, and I almost forgot Shorty and of course the Devourer. I thought Steven did a great job in describing the biology of an alien life form and how the alien grew and reproduced herself.I enjoyed some of the witty and humorous dialogue. And the story did draw me in and I couldn\u2019t wait to get to the end. But the story is told in a stilted narrative style, telling vs showing, and I know this story would have been so much better if the author had spent just a bit or time with filling in the emotional gaps. I felt like this was a 2nd or 3rd draft and not the polished script. And please, get rid of the over usage of metaphors.Steven Roy acknowledges that he had an editor, but you couldn\u2019t tell it. There are so many grammar errors, cause and effect errors and past and present errors that get in the way of the reading. Supposedly he corrected some of these errors. I would hate to see what this story looked like before. Final Analysis: Even though I really like the story and would recommend the book, I can only give 3 feathers. It\u2019s just not fair to other Indie Authors who actually take the time and spend the money to make their books presentable. BTW, awesome cover."}, {"userName": "Angela Crawford", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30952275-angela-crawford", "userReview": "Jefferson Balladeer is an African American who was adopted as an infant by the Balladeer family of Picayune, MS. When Ma and Pa Balladeer die in a car crash, it\u2019s left to Jefferson\u2019s older brother, Big Beau Balladeer, to raise Jefferson. While Big Beau is large of heart and body, he\u2019s not the ideal caregiver for the naturally intellectual Jefferson. Big Beau teaches young Jefferson the only thing he knows, how to be the ultimate redneck. Jefferson grows up to be a rodeo star and an expert marksman, and, as Big Beau would say, a certified, grade A ass-kicker. Jefferson becomes known as the Black-Redneck. When Jefferson is seventeen, he begins to question what he wants to do and who he really is. To further complicate matters, he finds out Pa-Balladeer told everyone that he adopted Jefferson so he could haul watermelons and cut wood. Jefferson puts Picayune in his rear view mirror and doesn\u2019t plan on ever stepping foot in Mississippi again. Twelve years later, Big Beau gets himself killed in a drunk driving accident, and Jefferson learns he is the sole heir of Balladeer farm. Jefferson decides to turn the massive plot of land into a huge subdivision. The people of Picayune are not happy. Jefferson\u2019s plan is going great until a creature known as the Devourer falls from the sky and begins turning the good people of Picayune into Space-Zombies. (Don\u2019t you hate when that happens?) What Jefferson thought of as a major inconvenience turns into a struggle for survival against a creature that has destroyed countless worlds. Now, if Jefferson hopes to survive and save the world, he\u2019ll have to remember all his rodeo and shooting skills. He\u2019ll have to take one last ride as the Black-Redneck.This book was so much fun! You get to know and love the characters right away (Jefferson is NOT your typical redneck), then it takes off for a wild ride. Kind of reminded me of a great B-movie. It will have you laughing out loud,and a few teary-eyed spots as well. Well written and fast paced. I can't wait to see more by this author!! A solid read I give it 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Mathew Carruthers", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5928892-mathew-carruthers", "userReview": "Read it for the title aloneAs the author states in his afterword, this is a B-movie premise written as a serious novel. Like any B-movie worth its salt, it must be embraced, flaws and all, to be fully appreciated. This novel is chock full of flaws - grammar, spelling, and so on - but is entertaining enough to look past the flaws and keep reading. Proofreading and basic editing would do much to take this book to the next level. It was a fun read, a guilty pleasure like every well-executed B-movie should be."}], "description": "The Devourer and her Space-Zombie minions have destroyed untold planets.Those worlds didn't have a Black Redneck.***Jefferson Balladeer is an African American who was adopted as an infant by the Balladeer family of Picayune, MS.
