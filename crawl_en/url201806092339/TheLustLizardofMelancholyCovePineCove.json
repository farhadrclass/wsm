Over a third of the population served by local Dr. Valerie Riordan, has been rendered dependent on antidepressants.Obsessive/compulsive cleaning freak, Bess Leander, is found hanged from a calico cloth rope, a possible suicide, and her friend Val fears she may have been overmedicating. Investigating the death, is the stoned town constable, Theophilus Crowe. Val next blackmails fish-fetishist and local pharmacist Winston Krauss into giving all antidepressant users in town placebos instead of their regular medication. As the antidepressants wear off, a hilariously uncontrollable erotic revolution takes place in the formerly groggy and uninspired population. A simultaneous nuclear plant leak into the ocean awakens a serotonin-deficit sea beast named Steve, who descends on the town, who is disguised occasionally as a double-wide mobile home. Enter Delta guitarist Catfish Jefferson who has recently been hired to play at the local \u2018Head of the Slug Saloon\u2019, where his marvelously sad blues has added to the local scene\u2019s seductive narcosis. Fifty years ago down on the Delta, Catfish first met the Sea Beast, the hundred foot creature, Steve, that loved his steel guitar sound and has now risen from the depths.This is laugh out loud funny and a bit zany at times. This copy is signed by the author Christopher Moore."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 3.5* of fiveThe Publisher Says: The town psychiatrist has decided to switch everybody in Pine Cove, California, from their normal antidepressants to placebos, so naturally\u2014well, to be accurate, artificially\u2014business is booming at the local blues bar. Trouble is, those lonely slide-guitar notes have also attracted a colossal sea beast named Steve with, shall we say, a thing for explosive oil tanker trucks. Suddenly, morose Pine Cove turns libidinous and is hit by a mysterious crime wave, and a beleaguered constable has to fight off his own gonzo appetites to find out what's wrong and what, if anything, to do about it.My Review: Am I too old for this humor to make me do more than chuckle quietly and without conviction? Has my curmudgeonly mask become my face?I'd say an instant yes and move on, light of heart and wreathed in smiles, were it not for this:I think there was always some scrawny dreamer sitting at the edge of the firelight, who had the ability to imagine dangers, to look into the future in his imagination and see possibilities, and therefore survived to pass his genes on to the next generation.Yep.So up from the Mount of Despairing Good-Enough books! Yay, right? Um. I think, though, it's past time to take a flensing knife and cut to the heart of the Moore Mystique.Let me know what y'all find. I ain't got so much as a sniff at a clue. Why does Good-Enough transmogrify into sales and gales of laughter?!

No matter how many time I shake my head or utter the words \"he's warped\" when I read Moore's books, I inevitably race through them, enjoying every word and chapter as though it were a big bowl of ice cream: deliciously satisfying and fun, fun, fun. Really, what other author can make you believe that a sex-starved prehistoric sea monster and a former soft-porn actress have a deep, romantic relationship? Moore is twisted and weird, and you really have to wonder what sort of childhood he had, but I hope he keeps cranking out the books because I have devoured every one of them."}, {"userName": "Edward Lorn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8850418-edward-lorn", "userReview": "I've heard many good things about Christopher Moore, but mostly I've heard that I'd love his sense of humor. In life, I take two things seriously: The health and security of my family. Everything else is fair game. If you can riff on religion, politics, sex and the overall human condition, in a thought-provoking, sarcastic manner, you will find a friend in me. For this reason, I would love to just sit down and have a conversation with Moore. I'm sure we'd laugh ourselves stupid.The Characters: A pothead constable, an aging b-movie actress, a psychiatrist, a biologist, a blues man, a painter, a pharmacist with a sexual preference for sea life and a barkeep that's more metal and silicone than human, make up the cast of The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove. And those are just the good guys. Somehow, Moore makes each of these people flesh and blood real. I even felt bad for the fish-f***ing druggist. I love well drawn characters, no matter how outlandish, and Moore delivers by the bucket-load.Now, I didn't read the synopsis of this book because someone warned me that Harper (Moore's publisher) tends to ruin some of the funnier moments with their blurbs, so I went into this book blind, aside from the title of course. When Steve the Sea Beast finds his first lover around page 60, I almost lost my mind laughing. Which brings me to the synopsis. Harper actually covers that scene in the blurb, so I was very happy I skipped the spoiler. There's far too much going on in this book to cover even a quarter of it here, but I will say Moore is now one of my favorite authors. One of the other warnings I was given before reading this book was that The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove was his most lackluster work to date, so if I enjoyed this book, I'd love his other stuff. We'll see about that. All I know is that I've never laughed so hard while reading. Ever. Period. The last forty pages of this novel had my sides hurting. The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove is a far-fetched, foul-mouthed, filthy-minded pedestrian, walking the streets of the Land of Make Believe. If you like your humor lewd and crude, but interlaced with witty social commentary, you will adore Christopher Moore.E."}, {"userName": "Peter Tillman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8101737-peter-tillman", "userReview": "A pretty good humorous Cal-contemporary fantasy -- which opens with a sea monster mounting a gasoline tank-truck, with, well, explosive results: \"...

Hamilton, take note.'Steve' stirs up the animal spirits of the low-seritonin residents of Pine Cove (aka Cambria) -- of which there are many, as the town's sole psychiatrist has cut off their Prozac, surreptitiosly substituting sugar-pill placebos, with the connivance of the town's sole pharmacist, who satisfies his carnal urges with an inflatable dolphin in his bathtub....[Dr. Val] came out of her office to find her new receptionist, Chloe, furiously masturbating, \"her steno chair squeaking like a tortured squirrel.\"\"Sorry,\" Chloe said, a bit later... \"I just want to stop.

Who else could give us a plot that includes all of the following: a former B movie starlet who still lives the life of her most famous role as Kendra: Warrior Babe of the Wasteland, a sea beast with a vendetta against a wayward bluesman, a psychologist who decides to put the entire town on placebo anti-depressants instead of the real deal, a pharmacist with a fish fetish (yes, that's right), meth labs and drug dealers, interspecies love, and occasional chapters told from the point of view of a labrador retriever named Skinner? This is not for everyone--serious people need not apply. The plot is wacky and unbelievable; in other words, vintage Moore. While I really enjoyed the book and laughed often, the only reason I gave it 3 stars is that, when compared with his other books, I didn't like it quite as much as Bloodsucking Fiends and Fluke (Or I Know Why the Winged Whale Sings).

As a result, business is booming at The Head of the Slug, the local Blues bar, run by Mavis, whose clients swear that underneath her ancient, wrinkled, liver-spotted skin there lurks the Terminator. Problem: those lonely Blues notes from her new hire, Catfish Jefferson, have attracted the attention of an enormous, 5,000-year-old marine reptile named Steve who has a thing for petroleum tanker trucks.With the advent of Steve, Pine Cove suddenly turns lustful and is hit by a weird crime wave with no understandable explanation. So Theophilus Crowe, the town constable, must find out what's wrong and what to do about it.Enter all our other old friends from other novels of Moore's -- Molly Michon, the aging but still-beautiful and deadly Warrior Babe of the Outland (well, she was, until a stupid accident that wasn't her fault left her with a scar that got her canned by the movie studio); Mavis, proprietor of The Head of the Slug (originally named \"The Head of the Wolf,\" but the local Greens decided the name was cruel to animals and forced her to change it); Dr. Val, the aforementioned psychiatrist; H. P., proprietor of H. P.'s Cafe, which features delicious delicacies such as Eggs Sothoth; Skinner, the happy-go-lucky idiot dog belonging to the Food Guy, biologist Gabe Fenton; and numerous others. Enter also some local villians who do meet timely, deserved, and hilarious ends, such as Sheriff John Burton, whose ranch hides a nasty secret, and who has been blackmailing pothead Theophilus Crowe into being the town constable for years; and Joseph Leander, the late Bess Leander's adulterous, murderous husband. With a less-than-together supporting cast of -- well, check them out for yourself.As one reviewer said, Christopher Moore must have been laughing his head off while writing The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove, and likely taking hits of nitrous oxide between sentences. The title alone is worth the price of the book, which could be substituted most successfully for every antidepressant in the pharmacy.As a bonus, the biomedical and scientific aspects of this novel were researched down to the bare bones by the author.

In other words, just another day in Christopher Moore's brain. The author has his brain working over-time in this silly little romp. Maybe a little too silly even for Moore. Yet it remains very funny and entertaining. Moore revives some of his Pine Cove residents including H. P., Mavis, and the grass smoking sheriff, Theopolis Crow. Add Molly Michon, a has-been starlet and Steve, a perpetually horny sea lizard and you get the idea this is not exactly Cannery Row.

The characters are not real. The author does nor reveal anything to me in the telling of the story. He has awareness that he is writing escapism and I like that. He is not your typical escapism writer like James Patterson or John Grisham who turn out one load of crap after another, but never stop taking themselves seriously. I like that his books are fun to read and I typically laugh out loud a few times during the read. Compared to my normal depressing books, it is nice to laugh and not think too much about everything he is trying to say. If you have read any of Moore's books you know exactly what I am talking about. This one was better than the last two in the vampire series he was doing, but not as good as some of his more well known books. I recommend it, if you are in a rut and just want to laugh a little, this book is great for that."}, {"userName": "\u1d25 Irena \u1d25", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5252054-irena", "userReview": "2.5You have to be high to read this.

I have since moved on to read several other of his books. Totally improbable, quirky, witty and twisted. My kind of humor. From the tale of the Bluesman Catfish Jefferson, to poor Steve the Sea Monster, looking for love in all the wrong fuel trucks, to Molly and her narrator, the story just flowed. I loved the way Moorse chose to describe things-ie \"It wasn't that their (the townpeople) anxiety was gone, but rather that it ran off their backs like warm rain off a naked toddler who had just discovered the splash and magic of mud\".Or Moore's creative if somewhat unorthodox use of a weed wacker. Or of Skinner the dog's perspective of life \"Danger, Food Guy!

Well, the local bar would probably see a boom in business. The general libido would also probably go up a notch. Some people's behavior might become a bit erratic. All this would make life more than a little complicated for the small town's adorable and hopelessly high police constable, Theo. And just to add to Theo's already messy life, an old bluesman decides to set up shop at the aforementioned local dive: his menlancholy tunes wake up an ancient beast with an axe to grind\u2026 and weird urges to fulfill.If the idea of a mildly insane B-movie actress and a sea monster having a deep romantic bond is something that weirds you out, my advice is to not read this book. Christopher Moore writes for people who like to stretch the suspension of disbelief to extremes, who find salty humor delightful and who think that weird stuff is just a part of life. I love him.Don't get me wrong: in theory, a story about a dinosaur emitting pheromones that drive everyone to frenetically fornicate within a 10-mile radius, while meth dealers do their thing, forcing the one utterly unqualified law enforcement officer to deal with organised crime and an entire town gone mad, could easy become crass and uninteresting. Except Moore writes with heart and laughter, he develops fucked up characters who are human, fun and endearing. That makes the utter ridiculousness of naming a sea monster Steve adorable and hilarious. This book is a great little adventure filled with uncontrollable giggles and oddball characters and I loved it!If you like zany and twisted humor and haven't read anything by Christopher Moore yet, this is a great place to start."}, {"userName": "John S", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32668942-john-s", "userReview": "Brief Synopsis: 'Lust Lizard' is set in Pine Cove, a small coastal town in Cali where the majority of the town has been taken off their anti-depressants on a whim by the one psychiatrist in town. There is a enormous sea creature masquerading as a trailer who happens to make people very horny (yes you read that sentence right). While all of this is happening, there is a underbelly of crime just simmering and waiting to overflow. Sound fun? Well it is.Unlike Moore's other books, this one does take a while to get going. The absurd and hilarious doesn't present itself much before 70 to 80 pages in, but to his credit, he is developing characters during that time. Each chapter is written with intention to focus on the thought process of one character. Every character has his or her own sense of charm and quirky habits. You have a stoner constable who is best friends with a recluse biologist who owns a dog named Skinner (funniest internal monologue btw). Those are just three of many. Each character gets ample time to develop, and each forms their own tapestry very well.There is nothing amazing or outstanding about the plot. The elements are all incredibly odd and don't seem like they would mesh quite right. (How can you expect a leather clad, broad sword wielding warrior princess to mix with a 80 year old blues singer???) But somehow it works. Yet, it all boils down to a simple, easy read. It's all in the presentation that makes this a hilarious ride.This books goes places you would never expect with characters that you would never imagine.

To begin with, the doctor has about a third of the population on antidepressants, but after an obsessive-compulsive patient commits suicide, the good doc Valerie Riordan finds herself at fault. After blackmailing the fish fetishist and pharmacist, she ensures that all of her patients are now receiving placebos instead of the real medication they need. At the same time, a radiation leak from a nuclear power plant is seeping deep into the water and awakening something fierce, a 20-foot sea lizard named Steve... and these are the tamest of events taking place in The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove by Christopher Moore.If you haven't read the first book and would like to start with this one, feel free to do so at your discretion. While Moore does reuse characters from his previous books as well as reference a few things, on the whole you don't need to have read the earlier novels to understand this one. You'll probably be able to laugh at a few more passages and feel closer to some of the people, but that's about it.A Trove of Black Humour and Absurdity Virtually all of the characters in this book go through trials and tribulations of their own, and while realistically-speaking some of them wouldn't make for a laughing matter, Moore manages to twist it into the realms of comedy. Speaking of the people, I'd say that this book has hands-down one of the most diverse casts you'll ever find in a book. Every single character is unique and differentiated from the others in very obvious ways, all of them having major quirks and strong defining personality traits, giving them all an eccentric quality, especially Steve the giant lizard from the sea. The Meaning of DecadenceWhile I am certain that many of his thoughts on real-life topics made it in here, such as the monopoly of the pharmaceutical industry on our daily lives, I am quite convinced that he never intended for this to be a serious adventure. The story is filled with ridiculous decadence and even some topics which a few readers might find distasteful, with there being a decent amount of immoral eroticism to be found. As the reader, I believe it is best to adopt the perspective that this is simply an adventure about having fun and letting go. One shouldn't over-analyze anything or try to grasp for some kind of greater meaning.The Final VerdictIt seems that Christopher has done it yet again, penning a novel far outside the limits imposed by rules and conventions. It's a savage and unrelenting story that takes us to the very outer edges of surrealism and ridicule, exploring lands very few authors would ever dare venturing into. It's a deeply-humorous book that offers a drastically different experience from virtually all the other novels out there, and if that's the kind of insanity which attracts you, then I have to wholeheartedly recommend this book for you.This was an abridged version of our review.

It started off well, but I enjoyed it less and less as I read. I usually enjoy the first half of his books more than the second half; I suppose it\u2019s because I like his characters more than his ridiculous plots.This story returns to Pine Cove, where the inhabitants are going a little nuts, because in a fit of misplaced guilt, the local psychiatrist has taken all of her patients off their antidepressant medications. Also a giant sea monster has come ashore and is psychically transmitting lust to the locals. Hilarity ensues.This is occasionally too sexually crude for my taste, and I also didn\u2019t like the scattering of brutal murders mixed in with such a silly comedic story."}, {"userName": "John of Canada", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12554712-john-of-canada", "userReview": "Monsters,weird monster sex,human sacrifices,drugs,interspecies relationships,several unreliable narrators,everything you could want in a book.I find I have to read Moore very carefully,because he slides in hilarious comments at the strangest moments."}, {"userName": "Donna LaValley", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4162429-donna-lavalley", "userReview": "The Lust Lizard of Melancholy Cove followed Christopher Moore\u2019s successful debut novel, Practical Demonkeeping. I don\u2019t know if he was high on his new popularity or high on something else, but this one disappoints, with colorful new characters being the only saving graces.Still in Pine Cove, California, some of the same characters (and the new ones) again must confront something supernatural, although the giant Sea Beast \u201clizard\u201d comes from deep in the ocean and has only one non-known animal characteristic: s/he makes all other animal life horny and eager for sex, but more especially if those people are lonely or sad. The color and shape changes of the animal echo those of cephalopods, so that\u2019s a \u201cscientific\u201d supposition. And, of course, this one devours people \u2013 but again, all of them are irritating and expendable people.Theophilus Crowe is the mature male whose point of view is the central one. There is always one such male, almost interchangeably so in each book, with similarly structured names \u2013 see Augustus Brine in Practical Demonkeeping. He grows marijuana, enjoys it, sometimes goes without it. He gets the Babe in the end. I enjoyed the new characters Gabe and Catfish, and the return of \u201cNailgun\u201d or Spider, the internet go-to guy of the local law. The women are mostly vile (especially Mavis).Sometimes sex between a woman and a beast is just too crude for me, even when -or especially when- it is written for laughs. Another problem I have with this book was inconsistency. For example, 2 guys on a meth lab are eaten by the Sea Beast, and we are told such guard-and-cooker teams are constantly rotating, 24 hours a day. However, when these 2 disappear, the author forgets that the next team would notice.When I\u2019m reading a book full of sex, odd characters, a crazy plot, revenge, slime, murder, and mayhem, but my mind wanders to \u201cGee, maybe I ought to pay some bills,\u201d then I know that despite the occasional laugh-out-loud lines, this was a 1-star book."}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4732757-kai", "userReview": "Uno sbirro strafatto di erba, un bluesman cinico sul viale del tramonto, un biologo trasandato preoccupato per dei topi in fuga, un'ex attrice di b-movie postapocalittici affetta da schizofrenia e accompagnata da un \u201cnarratore\u201d, uno sceriffo corrotto, dei narcotrafficanti, un nerd bulimico, una psichiatra che sostituisce i farmaci di un'intera comunit\u00e0 con dei placebo, un farmacista morbosamente attratto da pesci e cetacei, un paese in preda alle scalmane e, in pratica, Godzilla.

Sesso e lucertole \u00e8 forse il pi\u00f9 surreale del lotto, quello pi\u00f9 scanzonato eppure poetico, con una costruzione narrativa polifonica che sposta di continuo il punto di vista del narratore, arrivando a mettere i lettori nei panni di un cane e del mostro marino ma rendendo tutto spassosamente plausibile e ridicolmente vivido. Ma attenzione non si tratta di umorismo fine a se stesso o di demenzialit\u00e0 tout court, Moore sa il fatto suo, ha il dono della scrittura agile ma profonda, \u00e8 in grado di far ridere a crepapelle ma anche di strappare qualche sorriso amaro. Se non lo avete mai letto \u201cSesso e lucertole a Melancholy Cove\u201d potrebbe essere una buona porta d'ingresso alla sua produzione, \u00e8 un romanzo che risale a un decennio fa, uno dei primi, ma sappiate che una volta entrati nel suo mondo sar\u00e0 difficile uscirne.

It starts out innocent enough, but just spirals out of control. It's like the author wrote the first half of the book sober, and the second half, stoned out of his fucking mind. Because the second half is just plain bat-shit crazy.The story starts out nice and simple. A new sheriff comes to town. Greetings all around. Everything is fine. Nothing to see here. But then, naked people keep showing up everywhere. Fucking in the park. Fucking on the sidewalk. Fucking on the counter of the local diner, while the new sheriff is trying to drink his fucking coffee.It's very distracting, all these people fucking everywhere. You just can't get any goddamn work done. The fucking has got to stop, I tell yaz! So, the new sheriff gets the local shrink to prescribe some pills, to calm down the fucking hilarity. That'll work, right? Not so much.And then there's this huge lizard. A literal lust lizard the size of a goddamn T-Rex, that just shows up out of nowhere. It feeds on people's lust. Well, that is to say, it is the one causing all the people to fuck all the time. It sends out some signal, or pheromone, that makes people all horny and shit. And, somehow those signals draw the people to the lust lizard. To commune naked, and offer themselves up to the lizard as sacrifices, or some bullshit.See? Mr. Moore was smoking some good crack when he wrote the last bit of this book. It's fucking crazy. It doesn't make any goddamn sense. But I guess, at least it was a tad bit amusing. Because of all the crazy naked fucking people. And the fact that they named the big lust lizard 'Steve'. Because apparently, it looked like a Steve.It really cracked me up when they tried to reason with the lust lizard. \"Come on, Steve... Don't eat that guy. That guy's cool.
