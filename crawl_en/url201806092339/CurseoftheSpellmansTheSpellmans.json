Why is her mother leaving the house at all hours of the night to vandalize a stranger's motor bike? What is her father up to? Who is the mysterious neighbor John Brown? And who is recreating the string of vandalism Izzy is alleged to have perpetrated during her youth? All these questions and more will be answered in Curse of the Spellmans!When you enjoy the hell out of the first book in a series, the second book is a risky proposition, like bungee jumping, hitchhiking, or eating at White Castle with a gallon of beer already sloshing around in your innards. Fortunately, my apprehension was unfounded. Curse of the Spellmans is a worth second book.Much like the last book, Curse of the Spellmans is a hilarious tale of a dysfunctional family and the gross invasions of privacy they perpetrate on one another in the name of love. There's also a number of mysteries but the Spellmans and their supporting cast drive the tale.Told in a manner similar to the first book, Curse of the Spellman's isn't a linear tale. It starts near the middle, backtracks to the beginning, and then eventually makes it to the end.Detective Henry Stone is a prominent part of the cast since Rae latched on to him in the first book. He's also my third favorite character, right after Izzy and Rae. I already had a high opinion of him but the Doctor Who marathon clinched it, even though he prefers the ninth Doctor to the tenth.Izzy, despite her legion of flaws, is quickly winning me over. Raised in a family of investigators, she doesn't really know how to do anything else and conducts her personal life like one of her P.I. assignments. I think Lisa Lutz's greatness comes from being able to juggle funny moments with more serious ones and still make the book work without it becoming ridiculous. A good humorous mystery is hard to come by, in my opinion, but Lutz has consistently delivered the goods so far.I really have no gripes about this book. There's the minor quibble about there being less of a sense of discovery but it's the second book in the series. Unless the Spellmans were going to adopt a cute kid to bring new life into the series, there wasn't a lot more to unveil.Four out of five stars. I'll be reading the rest of this series at some point."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara", "userReview": "3.5 stars Thirty-year-old Isabel (Izzy) Spellman - as well as her mom, dad, and teenage sister Rae - all work for the family private detective business. Spying seems to be ingrained in the Spellman DNA because, besides taking on cases, they constantly snoop on each other and anyone else who comes into their orbit.Izzy is always on the alert for a new boyfriend (or as she puts it, a new future ex-boyfriend), so an attractive fellow who moves in next door to the Spellmans quickly catches her eye. Izzy immediately becomes suspicious, though, because the guy's name is John Brown (sounds phony) and he's a landscaper (seems fishy). John Brown soon becomes \"The Subject\" of Izzy's inquiries and she engages in various ruses to try to discover his place and date of birth and his SS number - so she can pry into his life. The subject is pretty cagey though and Izzy is stymied. Then, when nosey Izzy discovers that the subject keeps a door in his apartment locked, she becomes obsessed with getting into the closed room. Izzy's increasingly desperate (and funny) attempts to break in eventually lead to a restraining order and four arrests....a serious matter, because she could lose her P.I. licence.All this is quite entertaining and leads Izzy to other humorous situations including: meetings with a wise octogenarian lawyer who can't get the temperature of his coffee quite right; staying with a staid police inspector who has a lot of house rules; watching a bunch of episodes of \"Dr. Who\"; paying her teen sister Rae (a very tough negotiator) for services rendered; and more.Meanwhile, Izzy is trying to find out who's committing vandalism on a retired teacher's yard displays....a crime that eerily resembles some of Izzy's youthful misbehavior. To top it off, EVERY member of the Spellman family seems to have a secret. Dad is working out on the sly and eating healthy; mom is creeping out at night; Rae has mysterious new friends; and attorney brother David is (uncharacteristically) dirty and drunk. Of course Izzy feels compelled to find out what's going on with everyone. The book is entertaining but I found Izzy to be irritating. She has no boundaries, is intrusive, never asks permission, and seems oblivious of other people's feelings. In real life a person who met Izzy would probably want to move to the other side of the country.....or world. Still, the story is fun and would probably appeal to fans of comical cozy mysteries.

Not the recent ones but the early ones, the ones that made me laugh out loud before they got progressively more absurd and recycled the same plots. The Spellmans, however, are a family team and the nature of the family business means they can\u2019t really escape each other, although they may periodically try. Book two, Curse of the Spellmans, was just as much fun as the first and perhaps even a smidge better. I found it to be an enjoyable, light read that was a load of fun on a sick day.The rest of this review will be continued at here, since I might be talking about author behavior (then again, I might not).http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/1...or here:http://carols.booklikes.com/post/6455...-"}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1219253-amanda", "userReview": "3 1/2 stars for this one.Curse of the Spellmans is the sequel to The Spellman Files, a novel about an unconventional family that runs a private investigation firm. I really enjoyed The Spellman Files--it's light, amusing, and there is an inventive quality to the narrator, Izzy Spellman's, manner of conveying her story. Because of her training as a P.I., Izzy tells us everything in the form of case file reports and transcripts of secret recordings. What worked for the first novel lost some of its quirky charm for me in the second novel simply because I expected it. However, that is not to say that I didn't enjoy Curse of the Spellmans, because I certainly did.Izzy Spellman is now 30 years old and has spent half of her life working for her parents' private investigation firm. Because she was exposed to this lifestyle in her impressionable years, Izzy is pathologically suspicious of everyone and everything, and she lacks the ability to compartmentalize her work life and her personal life. With skills like surveillance, lock picking, on-the-spot lying, GPS tracking, and performing routine background checks, woe upon you if Izzy thinks you're hiding something from her. As one might expect, this wrecks any chance Izzy has for a normal romantic relationship. Izzy fast-forwards through the whole \"getting to know you\" stage of a blossoming romance in favor of gaining DOB and SSN to rummage around in the prospective romantic interest's background. This usually leads to some serious trust issues on the part of the men who fall for Izzy and, as a result, Izzy is still single. It's just this pattern of thinking that leads her to believe that her next-door-neighbor-and-potential-future-boyfriend is hiding a criminal past behind his suspiciously average name and an even more suspiciously locked door in his home. In addition to this mystery, Izzy's family members seem to have secrets of their own and Izzy, a complete stranger to the concept of personal privacy, begins to ferret out why her brother's wife seems to have disappeared, why her mother runs suspicious errands at 2:30 a.m., why her father is rapidly losing weight, and why her loner sister suddenly has friends no one in the family has ever met.If this sounds like another light, chick-lit screwball comedy, it is. These novels don't focus on the serious investigations of the Spellman Agency. Instead, they revolve around what happens in a family trying to keep secrets and boundaries when their bread-and-butter is to cross boundaries to discover the secrets of others. The mysteries really don't matter. They're simply vehicles for getting to know this bizarre and dysfunctional and frequently amusing family.

I don't mean random in a negative way at all. In fact, I find the randomness quite charming, just as I find Isabel Spellman quite charming and funny. Izzy and the entire Spellman clan are a bunch of nut cases, but the stories work for me. In this, the second installment of the Spellman series, Izzy finds herself busy surveilling the neighbor who is surely up to no good; her teenage sister Rae has run over her \"best friend\"...a forty-something-year-old inspector named Henry, and Henry, not surprisingly, is fed up; her practically perfect older brother David has lost his razor sharp edge; her mother is sneaking out of the house at all hours; and her father, well, he's secretly on a new found health kick. And there is more...but I'll spare you the run down. Like I said...random.What I love about Lutz's story is that everything seems to be happening all at once, and so the novel should feel chaotic. Yet somehow it doesn't. She shifts from subplot to subplot seamlessly, even though she is moving from one conflict to the next quite quickly. I would liken it to a professional race car driver, taking you out for a quick spin on the Autobahn in a Mercedes Benz. Even though you would inevitably be going so very fast, the ride would be perfectly smooth. I think I'd like to try that some day.And then, of course, there are the \"mysteries\" that Izzy must solve. I'll go ahead and admit that the central conflict, Izzy's obsession with the man next door's private life, was fairly easy to figure out, but the others are a bit more puzzling, so there was enough tension in the waiting to see what would happen next that I didn't get bored or want to scream \"DUH!\" the entire time I was reading. Moreover, these books really aren't about the mysteries and are more about the characters and their ridiculous antics, especially Izzy and Rae...or Rae and Henry, who make quite the comedic team, actually. I'm telling you, the characters here are a breath of fresh air, and so is the story, even if it isn't so mysterious. And this is mostly because of Lutz's wry sense of humor and excellent comedic timing. In fact, I like this one a little more than I liked the first, and I really enjoyed the first.I'm thrilled to have found these little gems, and I can't wait to read the next in the series."}, {"userName": "AdiTurbo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2199883-aditurbo", "userReview": "So much fun!

Although at times it was funny, overall I felt bad for the characters and myself! I felt like the author was talking down to me, the fact that the protagonist is a 30 year old woman who narrates in a more juvenile way than her 16 year old sister makes her INCREDIBLY hard to empathize with or to root for at all...Basic Summary - Isabel Spellman works as a PI for her parents and has a 15-year-old sister who is a bit crazy but idolizes Isabel. The driving force behind the entire novel is that Isabel believes her parents' new neighbor is suspicious...and that's it. She stalks him, tries to break into a less than exciting locked room in his apartment, follows him, etc etc...Perhaps not surprisingly, he turns out being a good guy with valid reasons behind his \"suspicious behavior.\" Really. That's it. This only comes to a head in the last two chapters or so. The only way readers can get through the rest of the book is with the comic relief of Rae (Isabel's sister) and Henry Stone - a cop who has somehow become sucked into the weirdness of the Spellman family and adopted Rae as his own personal project (mainly because he can't get rid of her). Not the WORST but definitely left me feeling less than satisfied."}, {"userName": "Jeanne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/388385-jeanne", "userReview": "Izzy's back! I was so excited to see a sequel to The Spellman Files.So, we revisit Isabel and the rest of the Spellman family, but they're not as colorful as I remember them.

Oldest child David has long distanced himself from the family and its business, becoming a lawyer whose only connection to their work is to sometimes send business to them. The problem is that Izzy, in particular, just can\u2019t stop. Everyone is a suspect to her, and with the help of a portable recorder, she has transcripts of lots of conversations, from witness interviews for actual cases to her mother suggesting to the cop Rae has befriended that he pose as Izzy\u2019s fianc\u00e9 so that the social worker will stop bugging the family about age-inappropriate friendships.That kind of device works in the book\u2014what would a first-person narration by a PI be without some transcripts?\u2014but the copious use of footnotes doesn\u2019t. Why do readers even need to be told, \u201c5Morty likes to Yiddishify my name\u201d in reference to her lawyer calling her \u201cIzzila\u201d?

This \u201ccharm\u201d would be completely off-putting\u2014when Izzy spends the night at her boyfriend\u2019s, the startled reader may have to remind herself that Izzy\u2019s not a teenager but a grown woman\u2014but Lutz redeems Izzy in a couple ways. This female screwball-detective-novel character is not a \u201cdumb broad.\u201d Her lack of social graces just makes her refreshingly outspoken and frank. And while this reviewer isn\u2019t in the habit of rewarding anyone for being immature, the current media trend\u2014in ads, in movies, and the like\u2014is for men to be unsettled goofballs and women to be super-responsible homemaker CEOs.

Isabel \"Izzy\" Spellman, having grown up in a highly dysfunctional family of private investigators in San Francisco, is distrustful of everyone, is not deterred by locked doors, social boundaries (really, she's not deterred by boundaries of any kind), and always has to get to the bottom of mysteries, even when it would be better for her if she just let it go. Now thirty and working in the family business, she gets in over her head when a new neighbor moves in next to her parents' house (and place of business), a gardener with the suspicious name of \"John Brown,\" who is evasive about his background, his movements, mounds of shredded trash and the locked office in his house. Izzy is certain that he is up to something sinister, and is determined to find out what, even if she has to maintain a level of surveillance that's usually reserved for stalkers. However, suspicious behavior isn't limited to Mr. Brown. There's also the members of her own family such as: her father Albert, who seems to be having a REAFO (Retirement Age Freak-Out) as he appears to be covertly changing to a healthier diet and attending a yoga class; her mother Olivia, who is sneaking out in the dead of night to regularly vandalize someone's motorbike; her perfect brother David, a successful lawyer who has suddenly taken to binge-watching television in his bathrobe and pajamas while drinking bourbon; her best friend Petra (and David's wife) who has gone off to Arizona with no explanation; her 15 year-old sister Rae who is busy stalking her new \"best friend,\" and regular acquaintance of Izzy's, SFPD Inspector Henry Stone to the point that his one attempt to give her a driving lesson ends with Rae accidentally running him over with his own car.All the while, Izzy has a new case: finding out who is vandalizing a local neighbor's holiday lawn tableaus in an eerily accurate recreation of the same vandalizations committed in '92-'93 by Izzy and Petra (although Izzy's knee-jerk reply is always, \"I don't know what you're talking about.\"), when they were at their most rebellious and delinquent time.I was amazed at Lisa Lutz's ability to keep so many plates spinning while making me laugh out loud frequently, and at the end, hope that Izzy comes out of this crazy ride at the end a little wiser and somewhat saner.

If the blurb is from a well-respected author such as Scott Turow or Tom Wolfe or even from an established book critic like Jonathan Yardley or Michael Dirda from the Washington Post there is bound to be some credibility to the book. When the quotes (in the case of this book) come from \u201cPeople\u201d magazine, \u201cEntertainment Weekly\u201d and from an author you\u2019ve never heard of it can be equally as telling. Curse of the Spellmans must appeal to some one; I\u2019m just not sure who. \tThe short version of the story is as follows: The Spellmans are a family of private investigators who live in San Francisco. The family consists of the two Spellman parents who are approaching retirement age, an oldest son (David) who is a successful attorney, a thirty-something daughter who is the main character and narrator (Isabelle or \u201cIzzy\u201d) and a precocious fifteen year old daughter (Rae). The reason these people make good investigators apparently is because they are compulsively nosey. The main plot begins when a new neighbor moves in next to the Spellman parents. His introduces himself as John Brown which sets alarms off in the head of Izzy Spellman. She is sure this is an assumed name and that this man is a criminal of some sort. These suspicions are confirmed when Izzy goes through the man\u2019s trash and finds that it has all been shredded. She goes so far as to date John Brown in order to acquire more information which is generally unsuccessful. There are lots of subplots involving Rae\u2019s learning to drive, Rae\u2019s first boyfriend and the Spellman parents\u2019 intrusion into all of these activities. The Spellmans are very good at snooping, especially into each other\u2019s lives. The story is written as humor and, as such, was a welcome respite from the violence and gore of several of the other nominees (the last two in particular). The problem is that to me, the book just wasn\u2019t that funny. Other reviewers have compared Ms. Lutz\u2019 humorous style to Carl Hiassen, but in my opinion she is not even close to his level. On a positive note, the dialogue this author writes is very good, it moves the story along and makes it much quicker to read which, in my mind, was a blessing."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/938229-david", "userReview": "While I thoroughly enjoyed the humor of this novel, I found it to be so disjointed and oddly organized as to be annoying. The book was chocked full of interesting characters with dysfunctional relationships that offered a good deal of humor but the plot took a backseat to the humor and sadly the humor was the central part of the book. It was funny, but it was far too cutesy. In fact it was so cutesy it came across like an episode of the naked gun. What little mystery there was got resolved in such an absurd manner that it made me want to throw the book across the room. The author is fond of using footnotes to make her jokes and witty comments which at first succeeds and then her overuse of this mechanism becomes as welcome as Jehovah's Witnesses on the doorstep. Over and over again the reader is forced to move his eyes to the bottom of the page so he will not miss the joke. At first this is funny, but by now you can tell how annoying it became before the end of the book. The blurbs by famous people on the back of the book liken the author to Carl Hiassan. Okay, she writes wacky stuff, but at least Hiassan does not let the humor take precedence over the story! Further, the blurb claims she is part Columbo and yet I never saw her do something remotely like our persistent beloved raincoat garbed detective. People magazine describes her as the love child of Dirty Harry and Harriet the spy. There are no \"make my day\" moments here leading me to wonder if the first book in this series was really different from this mediocre offeringThe heroine is wittier than Parker's Spenser, but it hurts the story.

Izzy), in San Francisco, now thirty years old and once again working for her parents at Spellman Investigations. Enjoying independence living in Bernie\u2019s (an ex-cop and friend) apartment while he was away became a short-lived vacation when he unexpectedly returns nursing a broken-heart, forcing a reluctant Izzy to move back home. Thus beginning the spin of an all new web of action-packed insanity.Izzy becomes fixated on her parent\u2019s new neighbor, John Brown. She\u2019s plagued by unanswered questions\u2026what\u2019s in those bags of shredded paper? If you live alone, why lock doors inside your home? It just didn\u2019t add up and her incessant probing makes Mr. Brown suspicious of her. One thing leads to another as she is convinced his landscaping business is merely a front or cover that\u2019s hiding something much more serious. She investigates Mr. Brown relentlessly, until he finally gets a restraining order against her. Arrested four times in the past three months, Izzy is in jeopardy of losing her PI license and even though her parents disagree strongly about Mr. Brown, she steadfastly refuses to let it go.All the while her father seems to be experiencing a \u201cretirement age freak out\u201d and her mother has taken to vandalizing a motor bike every night. Younger sister Rae has developed an intense friendship with Henry Stone, a police inspector with obsessive-compulsive disorder. The considerable age difference sparks the interest of Social Services, who despite the parents argument, simply refuse to see things quite so cut and dried. So in order to protect Rae\u2019s newly found \u201cstraight-laced way of life,\u201d which everyone agrees should be credited to Mr. Stone\u2019s obvious positive influence, big sister, is recruited and agrees to play along, pretending to be Henry\u2019s fiancee\u2019. It doesn\u2019t take long for Izzy to discover Henry Stone is a really good guy, a little off, but a good guy non-the-less.What follows is a laugh out loud, edge of your seat, knuckle crunching read that\u2019s loaded with that special Spellman sassiness. The smart-mouthed, in your business, business of private investigating, has been laid bare for all to enjoy in Curse of the Spellmans. This is one of those books you just can\u2019t seem to find a good place to stop - til you get to the last page. And then you can\u2019t help but wish for more. Lisa Lutz has created an original series, that just keeps getting better and better. With a cast of kooky and oh so lovable characters that are both frustratingly nosy and eternally loyal readers are cheering, sneering and giggling their way through these delicious literary treats. Well written, funny and full of heart - Lisa Lutz has developed a signature series that above all else, entertains!Kudo\u2019s."}, {"userName": "Jacqueline", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2999717-jacqueline", "userReview": "I'm not sure what to say about this book. I really love Izzy and Henry and Rae. But I didn't at all enjoy where the author went with the story. Her family treated her like crap and I felt really bad for her. I really felt like the reader was owed a villain and we didn't really get one. The suspect that Izzy is sure is up to no good is of course a good guy. I really wanted her to be vindicated instead of being made to feel like a fool whose parents didn't really love her. You know they are the ones who raised her to be so inquisitive and driven to find answers and to be creative in her solutions so having her arrested for borrowing her mom's car with out asking seemed too much. Especially since her mother spent the book vandalizing a teenagers motorcycle. I'm thinking Izzy's lack of respect for the rules might just have some justification. And in a book that was supposed to be lighthearted and humorous watching my heroine see her ex boyfriends all hook up with Olympic stars, and losing her apartment and sleeping in her car and having everyone down on her for not being a caring person and thinking about others was just too much. All those other people could make fun of her and being shitty to her and that was okay? It was all Izzy's fault? Every body else gets to be wrapped up in their own drama and no one forces them to learn a life lesson. So back to the reader was owed a villain and Izzy was owed vindication. I just didn't like how it ended. Although I got to say that I guessed what was happening fairly early but was just hoping I was wrong. The only parts I really liked were with Rae and Henry. I hope Izzy ends up with Henry since she loves him but at this point I don't really trust the author to get me there."}, {"userName": "Alice", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7838864-alice", "userReview": "\u2022Mlle Alice, pouvez-vous nous raconter votre rencontre avec Les Spellman se D\u00e9cha\u00eenent? \"Il y a quelques ann\u00e9es de cela, j'avais lu le premier volet de cette s\u00e9rie.

Izzy\u2019s brother David, a lawyer, has resorted to staying home, watching TV in his pajamas and eating junk food. Her father Albert is sneaking out of the house at all hours, returning with wet hair, while her mom Olivia is sneaking out of the house in early-morning hours and wreaking havoc on a motorbike. Her sister Rae runs over SFPD Inspector Henry Stone, her one and only friend. When a good-looking man moves in next door to her parents, Izzy intends to make him ex-boyfriend number 11. The two begin dating, but Izzy is intrigued by the man\u2019s common name, John Brown, and that he keeps a room in his apartment locked. Izzy decides to investigate Brown and becomes suspicious that she can\u2019t find out any real information concerning him. She manages to convince herself he\u2019s up to no good and begins following him and breaking into his apartment, which lands her in jail four different times, although she claims two don\u2019t count.The Spellmans are a hoot, and although this is considered a mystery, it\u2019s actually more about the characters and their interactions. This is a fast read, with short chapters, written from Izzy\u2019s point of view. The Stone and Spellman Show Episodes are hilarious and the footnotes are ingenious, as is the Appendix.

Unfortunately, I must say that the conclusion to the mystery was once again disappointing, because the case seemed initially fascinating and exciting, but it turned out that the truth was neither of those things. However, I am able to somewhat overlook the ending because I enjoyed the rest of the book.I am able to call this a four-star review because I really did have fun while reading, but I am hoping so much for a more satisfying mystery element in the third installment. Lisa Lutz seems to have writing humor down pat, but I am now hoping for more excitement. That would just make the book complete and perfect!I know that for many of the people who might have given this book bad reviews, their reasons might be that there are grammatical errors, or plot flaws, or other things that make it \"not quality literature.\" However, I think I would respond to that by saying that that's not what this book was meant to be, anyway.

The closest comparison I can draw is still Arrested Development's family issues. There is no way that characters like this could exist in the real world, yet they are provided with such realistic dialogue and motivations that you don't for a second question it mid-story. The joy and excitement of turning each page in this book was solely me looking forward to seeing what on earth they were going to do next. Unfortunately, the somewhat disjointed plot structure from the first book has blossomed into a full blown plot standstill in the second. Most of the over-arcing who-dunnit in this one is easily surmised very early into the book (not a good sign that it took Spellman Investigations so long) and the flash forward/flash backward storytellign doesn't distract from this. But you really don't care. You're not here for a stumper of a mystery, you're here for the bitingly cynical and witty outlook on life Izzy Spellman provides in her aside-filled often footnoted narration."}, {"userName": "Townsend the Wonder Hamster", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33158739-townsend-the-wonder-hamster", "userReview": "The second excellent read in the Spellman Investigations series.

Isabel is the problem-child sibling who hasn\u2019t grown up yet \u2013 but still, the most realistic and reasonable.

Okay, I'll give you the 'fast-paced.' I read it in less than a day and the (mostly) short chapters made reading it in short bursts without losing the thread of the story easy.The footnotes in many chapters were annoying. Few imparted useful information relating to the story and those few could have been handled as parenthetical asides. The overall effect was more 'cutesy' than anything.

Their first caper, The Spellman Files, was a New York Times bestseller and earned comparisons to the books of Carl Hiaasen and Janet Evanovich. Now the Spellmans, a highly functioning yet supremely dysfunctional family of private investigators, return in a sidesplittingly funny story of suspicion, surveillance, and surprise.  When Izzy Spellman, PI, is arrested for the fourth time in three months, she writes it off as a job hazard. She's been (obsessively) keeping surveillance on a suspicious next door neighbor (suspect's name: John Brown), convinced he's up to no good -- even if her parents (the management at Spellman Investigations) are not.  When the (displeased) management refuses to bail Izzy out, it is Morty, Izzy's octogenarian lawyer, who comes to her rescue. But before he can build a defense, he has to know the facts. Over weak coffee and diner sandwiches, Izzy unveils the whole truth and nothing but the truth -- as only she, a thirty-year-old licensed professional, can.  When not compiling Suspicious Behavior Reports on all her family members, staking out her neighbor, or trying to keep her sister, Rae, from stalking her \"best friend,\" Inspector Henry Stone, Izzy has been busy attempting to apprehend the copycat vandal whose attacks on Mrs. Chandler's holiday lawn tableaux perfectly and eerily match a series of crimes from 1991\u00c2\u00ad-92, when Izzy and her best friend, Petra, happened to be at their most rebellious and delinquent. As Curse of the Spellmans unfolds, it's clear that Morty may be on retainer, but Izzy is still very much on the case...er, cases -- her own and that of every other Spellman family member.  (Re)meet the Spellmans, a family in which eavesdropping is a mandatory skill, locks are meant to be picked, past missteps are never forgotten, and blackmail is the preferred form of negotiation -- all in the name of unconditional love.", "title": "Curse of the Spellmans\n      \n          (The Spellmans #2)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1590979.Curse_of_the_Spellmans", "average": 4.07, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1431587894l/1590979.jpg", "reviews": 1337, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/74189.Lisa_Lutz", "name": "Lisa Lutz"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Humor", "Mystery", "Humor", "Womens Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1590979.Curse_of_the_Spellmans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8486945-curse-of-the-spellmans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6882080-curse-of-the-spellmans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6284477-les-spellman-se-d-cha-nent", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20005129-curse-of-the-spellmans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17202948-curse-of-the-spellmans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3545389-curse-of-the-spellmans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/129117.The_Spellman_Files", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26154406-the-passenger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3545387-revenge-of-the-spellmans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6571967-the-spellmans-strike-again", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12166282-trail-of-the-spellmans"]}
