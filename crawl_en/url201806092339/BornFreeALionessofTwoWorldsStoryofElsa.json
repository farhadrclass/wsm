Why? Because it isn't just about a lion named Elsa, it is about a companion, a friend and a loving creature who shared in the lives of Joy and George Adamson when they lived in Kenya. Originally penned in 1960, it is the touching tale of how they raised an orphaned lion cub named Elsa and she grew to be their nearest and dearest friend - she was family. I have rarely read a book so heartwarming. Elsa was really very magical and unique, and after reading this book, having a lion around suddenly begins to sound much more enjoyable than a dog. The movie, Born Free, is of course based on this book, and it is one of my favorite movies of all time. The book encloses a lot more detailed information about Elsa, her habits and her charismatic personality. How lucky we are to be able to read about Elsa and appreciate a little slice of the African animal population through the eyes of two people who sincerely loved and understood these creatures better than most people could ever hope to. Everybody should read this book."}, {"userName": "Jami", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5777523-jami", "userReview": "While I loved Elsa's story and enjoyed most of the pictures in the book, this was not the heartwarming story I remember from my childhood. I love Elsa, but I really didn't like the Adamsons. It may be because I keep comparing them to Lawrence Anthony, another conservationist, and I find that Mr. Anthony seemed to have more respect for the animals' right to exist in their environment. I couldn't lose sight of the fact that Elsa was orphaned because he killed her mother thinking she was a male lion, leaving the three cubs without a mother. I was confused at her reference to \"beating\" Elsa when she tracked a donkey, which was a purely natural instinct, and not three pages later, said that they never used force with her. In my opinion, a beating counts as force, but maybe that's just me. Finally, I can't help but think how cruel it was to Elsa to keep sneaking off and leaving her when she was sleeping. They keep reappearing and disappearing - I'm not sure that helped her adapt to the wild or simply increased her confusion about where she belonged. She didn't know why the people she loved kept abandoning her and then returning and then repeating the process. One thing I got a chuckle out of was when they returned to Elsa for a three day period several times, and when she got to know the signs they were preparing to leave, she turned her face away from them. My 16 yr old shih-tzu does the same thing when I leave for work! She'll give me kisses whenever I ask, as she is a kisser. But, when I'm off to work, she knows - when I go to kiss her, she whips her face away and refuses to kiss me. When I come home after work, well, that's a different story!"}, {"userName": "Noran Miss Pumkin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/993934-noran-miss-pumkin", "userReview": "You saw the movie, you sang the song, you begged mother for the vinyl, and she bought you the book as a surprise. Elsa had all our hearts back then, and her was amazing and truly free in the end. It was the Feel Good story of the decade. so, I think it might be time to bring it back once again for the new generation.

I probably read the book along the way too but as usual don't remember. The story of Elsa and the Adamsons is still an amazing one of love and devotion between a wild animal and her 'pride', George and Joy Adamson. The descriptions of where and how they lived is really interesting as it's a way of life not many will ever experience"}, {"userName": "\u041f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u0440

This would be rated five stars except that I really try to be stingy with those. The book didn't make me cry, laugh-out-loud or change my thinking, and Adamson, while she writes well and fluently, doesn't have the impressive, lyrical prose of Beryl Markham and Isak Dinesen, two other European women who wrote celebrated memoirs about their time in Kenya. But what this book does offer is what a friend of mine called a \"lost art:\" The ability to write about an animal without treacly sentimentality but rather with sharp and insightful observations that make their personality evident (and in this case lovable) without a narcissistic focus on the writer and without an evident heavy-handed political agenda. Not that it hasn't had such a political effect. A Foreword by George Page quoting Faith McNulty claimed Born Free \"may have done for the cause of wildlife what Uncle Tom's Cabin did for the antislavery crusade.\" Not only did the book gain support for the protection of habitat and endangered animals, but the Adamsons helped pioneer the technique of reintroducing animals raised in captivity back into the wild. Not that Elsa could ever be called a captive lion. That's what made her happy ending possible. She was never confined, never treated with brutality in an attempt to dominate. Even after successfully released into the wild, when the Adamsons came to visit her she'd recognize and greet them with affection. As Joy Adamson put it, their relationship continued \"to be one of absolute equality quite different from that between a dog and his master.\" This is a short book you can read in a few hours and filled with a multitude of photographs of Elsa.

Though Elsa\u2019s sisters are sent to a zoo when they are still cubs, Elsa remains in Kenya with the intent of joining her sisters later. When she is nearly a full grown lioness, George & Joy no longer have the heart to place Elsa in captivity; not when she has grown up in her native environment.

He then found her three young cubs (and felt great remorse at having killed their mother) and took them home. Two of the cubs were eventually sent to a zoo, but the smallest, Elsa, stayed on as a member of the household. The bond between Elsa and the Adamsons is incredible. While raising Elsa as a pet, they rarely kept her penned up or chained and gave her a lot of freedom to still act like a lion. She was very loving and affectionate to them, and to other people who came into contact with her. You can almost feel the love that Joy and Elsa shared, and Elsa\u2019s personality comes through very clearly. The descriptions of her playful antics are amusing, and it\u2019s an interesting peek also at life in the bush. When the time inevitably came, Joy and George made the hard decision to release Elsa into the wild. After finding a suitable location, they spent a lot of time teaching Elsa to hunt for herself. They would make camp, spend time with Elsa, and then leave her on her own for a day, then a couple of days, then a week at a time. She was always happy to see them on their return, while at the same time growing more and more self-sufficient. Even after being in the wild on her own for several months, Elsa would still get very excited when George and Joy visited her, showing them much affection and wanting to play with them. But she also grew more independent, and began to show signs of wanting them to leave her alone, and her transition from family pet to wild lioness was successful. A heartwarming and well written story, with lots of pictures (in my edition of the book anyway), and now I want to watch the movie again."}, {"userName": "Lesle", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28186136-lesle", "userReview": "A story of Elsa a lion cub raised and loved by Joy and George. A telling of the hardship for both Elsa and her human family. It seemed at times to be unattainable and a failure. The life for Elsa was torn between that of being a pet or living a free life in the wild as she was meant to have. The steps in her life are told in many fun and hard adventures. Elsa finally is her own lioness but she never forgets her human family. Elsa's story started the wild animal rights to live wild and free and ends in a very real legacy left by both Elsa and the Adamson's.Adamson's writing flows like a conversation between friends.

One of the people lucky enough to experience this was Joy Adamson, the author of the book. Just being in a Safari car on a bumpy road is all worth it, even in tall grass never knowing what is coming around the corner. But as long as the truck is moving you can never take even a half decent picture, and when searching for lions, its just part of the adventure. But Joy Adamson never had to do that she could almost always walk out onto her porch and let her pet lion Elsa suck her thumb. This incredible story is of a lioness that starts with the very beginning of its life. I have lived in Africa for about 3 years and have never heard anything like it until reading this awe-inspiring book.Although she originally had three lions she gave the bigger two out into a zoo in London after they were old enough to care for themselves. The smaller one, Elsa, was too reliant on people for food so they kept her. When she was around two years old, they tried to release her gradually but failed. Could they do it and release her with ease? Read \u201cBorn Free\u201d to find out.

But to warn you, this book is mildly racist, scatterbrained, and boring at some parts. One paragraph she'll be telling this one story and then she'll get off track and tell a different story without summing up the first one or giving the second relevance or importance. Some areas I zoomed through reading and others I practically fell asleep at. I thought it would be interesting because it was about a lion... I guess lions can be boring, too.My last issue with this book is when she beat Elsa for mauling the donkey and when she would say she \"didn't like to kill animals.\" Whenever she said she didn't like killing animals, she would follow it up with some story of why they 'had' to kill an animal. Her husband would randomly kill animals and she would talk about how it was 'necessary.'"}, {"userName": "g-na", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7709596-g-na", "userReview": "This is the 40th anniversary edition of this classic book, and it contains a new forward. I remember seeing this movie as a child, and it had a very sad ending that made me cry. This book, however, did not end on a sad note; now I think the movie may have included part of the storyline from the book's sequels.Born Free is a cute, bittersweet story of a couple in Kenya and their lioness, raised from a cub and successfully returned to the wild. It took place in the late 50s and retains a tiny bit of the cultural attitude that was prevalent at the time.

I thought it was amazing how intelligent Elsa was. In many ways she was smarter than the typical canine. Elsa must learn how to hunt and survive on her own with only her human parents to teach her.

It retells the experience Joy and her husband George as they raised Elsa for three years. Throughout the story they travel on safaris and introduce Elsa to the natural world. Joy and Elsa develop a mother-daughter like relationship that lasts a lifetime. \u00a0I was not a fan of this story because it did not seem coherently written and if it was published now, it would look more like someone's blog rather than a story. Joy is both the author and one of the main characters, and she goes off on tangents about loosely relevant topics, such as a safari she once went on with (Pati the rock hyrax) before she found Elsa. The plot of the book seemed all over the place at times; it would just jump to an only slightly relevant topic. Additionally, often entire chapters seemed pointless and not relevant to the story. The most prominent example of this is the third chapter \"Elsa Goes to the Indian Ocean\" where Joy and George took Elsa to the beach when she turned a year old. This chapter adds nothing to the story except for a plot point that is quickly resolved in the next chapter and the fact that Elsa was playful with the other animals, which was already shown in the second chapter. I was not impressed.\u00a0Despite the unfortunate writing style, Born Free echoes the theme of an unbreakable mother-daughter bond, which is displayed through the relationship between Joy and Elsa. This was highlighted when they were temporarily separated at various points throughout the story.\u00a0Elsa cried when she missed Joy. Whereas, Joy couldn't keep Elsa and the safety of her well-being out of her thoughts. This theme is woven throughout the story and it's incredibly heartwarming to hear Joy and Elsa care for each other in their times of need. \u00a0Joy was not the worst narrator, but she frequently showed obvious bias\u00a0throughout the story. Since she narrated with the perspective of herself as a main character, she constantly portrays herself and Elsa as perfect and omniscient and incapable of doing anything wrong, which can get slightly annoying. The only fault of Elsa that Joy recognizes is Elsa's lack of independence, but Joy would rather Elsa not be independent, and stay with her forever. \u00a0Finally, something I really liked and appreciated about this book was the abundance of pictures. They help clear things up in the story when Joy got distracted on a tangent. However, the pictures were not evenly distributed and a chapter could be six pages of no pictures, and then five pages where three and a half of the pages were pictures. This was only slightly bothersome as it is understandable for the pictures to be formatted this was as they were taken over fifty years ago. The pictures also made the book seem a lot shorter because half of every chapter is pictures and the book is only 220 pages in total. \u00a0Despite some annoyances in the writing, this book was still ok. The pictures of Elsa were very cute and the book wasn't too long to read."}, {"userName": "Andrew Ives", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5949552-andrew-ives", "userReview": "(1st ed, 7th imp) Although I remembered not liking the film much at all, and knowing that the book would be without the Matt Monro music which was the best thing about the film, I hoped that somehow the book would be better than the film, as is often the case with adaptations.Alas, it was not to be. I expected a film/book about lions to be fairly red in tooth and claw, but basically this is a gruesome chronicle of shooting every kind of unfortunate gazelle, zebra, warthog, crocodile, guinea fowl, antelope, fish, buffalo that crosses the Adamsons' path. As well as taking sheep for a stroll with Elsa the lion 'for dinner later', having a pop at a rhino and hunting other 'trouble-making' lions (including Elsa's mother), the locals' traditions of spearing elephants, slitting buffalo throats and the lions themselves hunting the odd camel, person, monkey, cow and donkey adds to the unpleasantness. Coupled with plenty of unappealing b&w, not-particularly-well-taken photos (a few with the wrong captions) of corpses and carcasses being dismembered, I felt like some kind of butcher reading this and frequently came close to giving up. It's quite worrying to think this is about the 1950s not the 1750s.On the plus side, it's short and Joy's writing style is quite old-fashioned and matter-of-fact. The manuscript could benefit from some proofreading as she often spells 'carcass' and 'carcase' differently on the same page and the punctuation is rather sparse. The map on p42 looks lost there and might just as well be at the front somewhere where the reader can find it more easily. Most of all, I don't like how this is almost portrayed as a scientific experiment - not dissimilar to Project Nim - to see how lions adapt to being half-wild and half-tame, and the 'surprise' finding that lions have some intelligence. Of course they do! After reading this book, Elsa and the hyrax are the only ones who come out of it with respect, having done no wrong at all. The humans' behaviour is somewhere between stupid and disgusting.

Especially now, at a time when the sanctity of the wild and its inhabitants is increasingly threatened by human development and natural disaster, Adamson's remarkable tale is an idyll, and a model, to return to again and again.Illustrated with the same beautiful, evocative photographs that first enchanted the world forty years ago and updated with a new introduction by George Page, former host and executive editor of the PBS series Nature and author of Inside the Animal Mind,  this anniversary edition introduces to a new generation one of the most heartwarming associations between man and animal.", "title": "Born Free: A Lioness of Two Worlds\n      \n          (Story of Elsa #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/758153.Born_Free", "average": 4.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1406563918l/758153.jpg", "reviews": 281, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/132350.Joy_Adamson", "name": "Joy Adamson"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Animals", "Cultural", "Biography", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/758153.Born_Free", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/414777.Born_Free", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34870216", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13017331-nata-libera", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34686723-born-free", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3007344-born-free", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30755202-born-free", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21178259-born-free", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24442708-p-b-h-lvice-elsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13647143", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16029315-p-b-h-lvice-elsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/798784.Living_Free", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/226126.Forever_Free", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1893408.The_Spotted_Sphinx", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/798781.Pippa_s_Challenge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20524751-born-free"]}
