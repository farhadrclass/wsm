Each chooses his role and then forgets this, sometimes for many lifetimes, until one comes along who can remind him. This time you may be the villain or the victim. The next time your roles may switch.It is only a role. Try to remember.\u2019Claire DeWitt has been enticed back to her former stomping grounds in New Orleans to investigate the disappearance of a prominent DA attorney, Vic Willing. He disappeared during Hurricane Katrina. The most natural reaction to such a request is that LOTS of people disappeared during Katrina, some by choice and some because they were washed out to sea or in those turbulent times were the victim of circumstances. It wasn\u2019t difficult to be in the wrong place at the wrong time because there was no right place. Still there is a ripple in the universe that tells Claire this is a case for her. Even though her client, Leon, is an idiot. \u201d\u2019He fed the birds,\u2019 I said to Leon.Leon made a little face of disgust. People in New Orleans have a thing about birds.\u2018Oh I forgot about that,\u2019 he said. \u2018Those parrots. I think they\u2019ve got some program getting on to get rid of them. They\u2019re an inverted species or whatever you call it.\u2019\u2018Invasive,\u2019 I said. \u2018So are we.\u2019\u2018Yeah. They eat crops,\u2019 Leon said.\u2018Unlike us,\u2019 I said.He frowned. \u2018They\u2019re dirty,\u2019 he said. \u2018They spread disease.\u2019I looked at him.\u2018They\u2019re from--\u2019 he began, then stopped. \u2018They live in--\u2019\u2018I heard some of \u2018em are communists,\u2019 I said. \u2018Watch out. Do you mind if I take fingerprints?\u2019\u2018Fingerprints?\u2019 Leon said, confused. \u2018They have fingers?\u2019\u2018Uh, no,\u2019 I said.\u2019Well, maybe. But not from the parrots. From the house.\u2019\u201dWhile checking through Vic\u2019s bathroom Claire palms some down payment on the investigation... bottles of Vicodin and Valium. Leon you are just WAY too slow man.Claire is the best private investigator on the planet for two reasons. Jacques Silette the writer of the investigative bible called Detection is dead and Claire\u2019s mentor in the Silette investigative techniques Constance Darling is also unfortunately dead. By default Claire is now the best. They both were key in shaping Claire\u2019s life and both still intrude like mystics into every case. \u201dNever be afraid to learn from the ether,\u201d Constance told me. \u201cThat\u2019s where knowledge lives before someone hunts it, kills it, and mounts it in a book.\u201dThat might be what I\u2019m doing with this review...killing it and mounting it. \u201dThe clue that can be named is not the eternal clue,\u201d Silette wrote. \u201cThe mystery that can be named is not the eternal mystery.\u201dPlease feel free to ponder for as long as you like. Claire went through a hard time after Constance was killed. She lost her center. Her rock. Her reason for reasoning. The state of Utah declared her officially insane. She got kicked out of a tattoo convention in L.A. and was banned for life from the Sands in Vegas. I have a feeling that a bit of advice from Constance eventually percolated through the mist of pain. \u201dYou can\u2019t change anyone\u2019s life,\u201d she said. \u201cYou can\u2019t erase anyone else\u2019s Karma.\u201d...\u201dAll you can do is leave clues,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd hope that they understand, and choose to follow.\u201dConstance left plenty of clues providing a path for Claire for when she was ready to follow. I have people in my office asking for advice about just about everything from what car to buy to whether their personal relationships are working. I\u2019m thinking about hanging out a shingle. The frustrating part is that usually they are looking for someone to agree with them not offer advice. I persist in the face of such disappointment and hope that after their determinations don\u2019t pan out that the way will be cleared to at least take another look at the advice I gave them. (Maybe if enough time has passed the idea will now be theirs.) I never thought about advice as clues and certainly that is a more Zen way to look at these situations. I\u2019ve had my moments where I\u2019ve felt more like saying to heck with everyone and closing my door to their problems. Constance\u2019s advice made me remember to use\u2026Serenity Now!\u201dHappiness is the temporary result of denying the knowledge one already has,\u201d Silette wrote. \u201cOnce one knows what one knows--once one knows the solution to his mysteries--happiness is besides the point. But in rare cases, something much better can bloom.\u201dLet that bang around in your head for a while. Is that a martini crooning to me from the bar?Leon decides to fire Claire because the investigation is moving slooowwwly (clues don\u2019t always reveal themselves quickly or in an orderly fashion),and also because Claire is circling around some revealing characteristics of Vic that may tarnish his image.Don\u2019t panic this has happened before.\u201dLeon,\u201d I said. \u201cAt some point in the development of the detective/client relationship, it\u2019s natural for the client to want to fire the PI. It\u2019s a part of the process, and that\u2019s okay. But we need to move past that, to a better place--a place of healing, if you will.\u201dI didn\u2019t think any of that was true, about clients wanting to fire their private dicks. They usually wanted to fire me. That was true enough. Almost always they wanted to fire me. Actually, every time. Every time except one, the time in Dallas when the guy killed his own mother and then hired me to find the killer because he didn\u2019t know the murderer was one of his own personalities. He never fired me.Sara Gran\u2019s writing style reminds me of Jasper Fforde. Like Fforde she balances witty repartee, and wacky characters with weighty philosophical concepts that made this reader stop frequently to take a few of those thoughts for a lap or two around the brain before moving on to the next paragraph. She has introduced us to characters like Constance Darling and Jacque Silette that could each merit their own books in the future. I\u2019m more than curious, maybe insatiably so, to discover where Gran will take Claire DeWitt in book two.

", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol", "userReview": "I was a little afraid to re-read this book, because the first time through was so absolutely stunning, it was as if it was written for me. As my first review did not do justice to its wonderful combination of mystery, introspection, and setting, I'm setting out to rectify it.Claire DeWitt is a detective, willing to use all means necessary--including hallucinogenic dreams, the I Ching and fingerprint analysis--to solve her cases. She knows ultimately she will be solving the case for herself, because sometimes the client doesn't want it solved:\"The client already knows the solution to his mystery. But he doesn't want to know. He doesn't hire a detective to solve his mystery. He hires a detective to prove that his mystery can't be solved.\"Leon is a client who has requested her help finding his uncle Vic, a lawyer who disappeared during Hurricane Katrina. He feels a little guilty: \"'You know what it says in the Bible,' Leon said with resignation. 'Look out for thine uncle as you would thineself. Or whatever.'\"Claire tends to lie a little if it suits seeking solutions to a mystery, and isn't entirely honest about her history to Leon. \"'How old are you?' 'Forty-two,' I said. I was thirty-five. But no one trusts a woman under forty. I'd started being forty when I was twenty-nine.\"Claire's search brings her into contact with gangs of feral, forgotten children and with her own tumultous history as a detective when she apprenticed in New Orleans. Claire frequently references a book by a famous detective (albeit fictional) whose thoughts on detecting are philosophical bon mots on mystery, truth, and humanity, as well as her history with Constance, her mentor. The time shifts flow smoothly and don't feel the intrusive into the story; in fact, they blended very well, sometimes foreshadowing the next development in the mystery. Claire's own mystery was worked in nicely, leaving a feel for her character but with a sense there is a lot more to discover.As in many detective mysteries, setting plays a crucial role. One of the many small mysteries of the book is how Claire and the people of New Orleans never refer to Katrina by name, the way the rest of the country does. They call it a 'flood' and speak of it in terms of days  (\"'By Monday the phones were down and...' The rest of his sentence was obvious and he didn't say it out loud\") or by location: at the Superdome, Houston, back home. Claire notes the problem with locating people, phone numbers, addresses in post-Katrina New Orleans, and at least a couple of the locals involved in Claire's mystery are suffering from post-traumatic-stress disorder. Finding Vic means visiting some of the ravaged areas, and Gran's imagery is striking in its objectivity: \"Signs with letter missing told the story: lots of OTELS and HOT BO LED CRA FISH and AWN SH PS. In the intermediate zone I started to see the marks spray-painted on houses: circles with X's through them, numbers and letters in the hollows of the X.\"For those that are sensitive to it, there is proliferate drug use, but it is handled well. Without being judgmental, it is apparently an activity Claire engages in to self-medicate as well as bridge gaps between herself and other people. Interestingly, I thought Gran managed a nice balance between acknowledging the reasons for doing it at the same time showing the non-glamorous side.I can't say enough about Gran's ability with language--my Kindle copy has highlights every chapter. The dispassionate descriptions lend themselves to the creation of emotionally blunted characters, and yet somehow Gran manages to convey humanity, tragedy and humor, as well as the character of a city. Gran's writing has a lovely sense of balance, injecting small bon mots of humor, sarcasm, and absurdity that leaven the emotional weight of the mystery and of the post-flood setting. Claire is very good at mocking herself as well as those that ignore the mysteries around them:--\"He looked like he was waiting to see a doctor about an unusual lump.\"--\"I concentrated on the goats. They were good company. They overlooked most of my personality defects and failures, my withdrawal of food from the fatties, and my inability to speak goat.\"--\"You don't know that,\" Mick said, weakly trying to fake liberal outrage.--\"Houses are like people, only less annoying.\"--\"I heard Mick roll his eyes over the phone.\"Yet despite the humor, both Claire and Gran are very careful and compassionate with the hollow-eyed thin adolescents of New Orleans. I loved that finesse, the unwillingness to sacrifice a character or story to the villain prototype. The inclusion of the social-economic commentary elevates it beyond mere mystery to a meditation on humanity, all without sermonizing or being particularly heavy-handed. It's an odd little cross-genre read, but a highly enjoyable, thought-provoking one. After reading, I immediately tracked down a hardcover so I could be assured of being able to read it again, anytime, much like Claire and her copy of D\u00e9tection.Cross posted at http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2013/0...re-read July 16, 2015.

She has a \"bible\" that she goes by written by her idol French detective Jacques Silette, she doesn't mind using a few drugs to enhance her abilities, and she believes she is the world's greatest detective.Several of those very qualities got on my nerves at times during the book.Lord, forgive my sins, of which there are too fucking many to count.Then there were times I liked her.

Can she put her personal demons aside long enough to find out?This is the sixth book in my Kindle Unlimited Experiment. For the 30 day trial, I'm only reading books that are part of the program and keeping track what the total cost of the books would have been.This is one of those books that's going to be really hard to do justice to in a review. Claire DeWitt is the greatest detective in the world and a very unconventional one. Her bible is a book called Detection by renowned French detective Jacques Silette, a confusing and contradictory philosophical tome that is either a work of genius or utter insanity.If George Pelecanos' Nick Stefanos learned his methods from Douglas Adams' Dirk Gently and was female, the result would be a lot like Claire. Or if Nancy Drew suffered a great loss and got hooked on drugs. Rather than relying on conventional methods, Claire supplements them with intuition, dreams, the I-Ching, and a cocktail of alcohol and mind-expanding drugs. City of the Dead reads like a vision quest at times.The combination of philosophy and the wreckage of post-Katrina New Orleans do a lot to raise this above a lot of similar detective fiction involving missing persons. The setting is a character unto itself.Claire's background is explored in dreams and flashbacks, revealing how she became the world's greatest detective, starting with solving mysteries with her two friends when she was just a teenager, having found Detection in a forgotten dumbwaiter in her parent's dilapidated mansion. Lots of dark things are only hinted but you get the feeling Claire has been to hell and back several times.The case was suitably serpentine and while I had an idea what happened to Vic Willing, I was in the dark about the particulars for most of the book, which I love in a mystery. The whole thing reminded me of Twin Peaks a bit in its strangeness.I've made the book sound really dark but it's not. Claire's sense of humor keeps the book from descending too far into the darkness despite the horrors she uncovers.Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead is one of the best books I've read all year.

Neither Claire or anyone she comes into contact with is in a partying type of mood and while the novel is desaturated of romance and often difficult for me to love, I did really like it.The story begins in January 2007 with the self-proclaimed \"world's greatest private eye\" returning to the Big Easy, the city she left ten years ago, for a meeting at the Napoleon House in the French Quarter with her client, Leon Salavatore. The client hires Claire to find his late mother's brother, assistant district attorney for the New Orleans prosecutor's office, Vic Willing, who his nephew and sole heir has not seen since the flood. Leon's first question to the private eye is how old she is. \"Forty-two,\" I said. I was thirty-five. But no one trusts a woman under forty. I'd started being forty when I was twenty-nine.Leon is just as tentative about Claire's mental health, mentioning that he heard she was in the hospital for a nervous breakdown, rumors Claire shoots down by claiming she was in an ashram. The background she's already assembled on Vic Willing--fifty-six, male, white, single, no children--suggests a prince among men, an honest lawyer who was well-respected by his peers and clean as a whistle. Examining a photograph of her target taken on the balcony of his apartment on lower Bourbon Street, Claire discovers hundreds of green parrots perched in a tree in the background. So begins The Case of the Green Parrot.Claire is a disciple of Jacques Silette, the Parisian private investigator whose book, D\u00e9tection, was published in 1959 and though now out of print, Claire considers her Bible. She moved to New Orleans in 1994 to work for Constance Darling, a former student and lover of Silette's, and she left the city when her boss was murdered three years later. Claire first came into contact with D\u00e9tection as a child when her friend Tracy found a copy in a dumbwaiter in her parents' house. They began solving mysteries in the fourth grade with another friend, Kelly, discovering Silette's first rule of solving mysteries: most people don't want their mysteries solved.I'd met Constance in Los Angeles in 1984. A detective named Sean Risling had set up an introduction, knowing I needed work and Constance needed help. She was in L.A. on the famous HappyBurger murder case. Of course I knew who she was; the famous detective, student of Silette, the eccentric from New Orleans, admired by some, reviled by more. Stilette and his followers have never been the most popular detectives. No matter how many cases we solved or how quickly we solved them, respect was always hard to come by. It was like an episode of Quincy, stretched out over fifty years. All the better, Constance explained later, when we were friends. High expectations from others can cripple you.Claire navigates New Orleans with the help of another former student of Constance Darling's, an amateur criminologist named Mick Pendell, heavily tattooed and trying to recover from losing his home and his marriage in the flood. Fingerprints she's recovered at Vic's apartment indicate that eighteen year old Andray Fairview has been there. Native New Orleanean, orphan, with a record for possession and assault and two arrests for murder. Claire has already met Andray, coming out of a gas station to find him leaning against her rental pickup with his goofy buddy Terrell. She dubbed the pair Suicide Boy and Dreadlock Boy, unsure which of them peed on her tire. Mick knows Andray through his work with Southern Defense, providing legal services for the underprivileged. He doesn't want to believe the boy would murder Vic Willing, but Claire is ready to wrap up the case. Interviewing Suicide Boy at Orleans Parish Prison where he's been interned for loitering, Andray maintains that he met Vic while cleaning swimming pools. He claims they talked about birds and to prove it, shows Claire a book that Vic gave him: D\u00e9tection by Jacques Silette. The more time Claire spends with Andray, the more inclined she is to believe his innocence and to suggest to her client that Vic Willing wasn't the prince others claimed he was.Claire's personal life remains a FEMA disaster area. She frequently slips into stupors, whether drug induced or from simply not eating or sleeping, which is how she ended up under medical supervision back in San Francisco. Clues come easier to her in blackouts, though they've been unable to help her locate her childhood friend Tracy, who disappeared in Brooklyn in 1987 and whose vanishing irreparably damaged her friendship with Kelly, also a private investigator. Fate is unkind to those of Claire DeWitt's profession, as she discovers trying to seek out the legendary Jack Murray, a brilliant New Orleans private eye and Silette disciple who now wanders Congo Park, homeless.\"The first thing you need to know about being a detective,\" Constance explained when she was interviewing me to be her assistant, \"is that no one will ever like you again. You will turn over their stones and solve their crimes and reveal their secrets and they will hate you for it. If you're stupid enough to marry, your husband will never trust you. Your friends will never relax around you. Your family will shut you out. The police, of course, will loathe you. Your clients will never forgive you for telling them the truth. Everyone pretends they want their mysteries solved but no one does.\" She leaned toward me. I smelled her violet perfume, her expensive face powder. \"No one except us.\"Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead is a novel for antiquarians, for those whose pulses race at the thought of discovering rare out-of-print books, priceless artifacts warehoused in attics or pirate treasure buried under redwood trees. The lurid elements of pulp fiction--broads, bullets and booze--are not to be appreciated here. Gran has worked in used and rare books, at The Strand and Shakespeare and Co, and was an independent bookseller, and this is what the novel is about. My fault with it is how often character and story are subordinated to book reviewing, with so many passages devoted to D\u00e9tection that the novel starts to resemble a Chinese fortune cookie.While reading the novel is as much fun as getting shushed in a library and Claire DeWitt seems to have that brilliant detective's tendency to know key things with a minimum amount of detection, her background is unlike any other sleuth I've encountered, moving discontented from one city to the next--Brooklyn, L.A., New Orleans, San Francisco--more like a Gaslight Era ghost than an analog hipster. NOLA is a haunted city and Claire DeWitt is one haunted character, solving mysteries that fail to reveal the bigger truths she's really looking for. I have too much of a heavy dark wheat taste left in my mouth to order the 2013 sequel, Claire DeWitt and the Bohemian Highway, but this one isn't bad."}, {"userName": "Lori", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68050592-lori", "userReview": "It's a great noir detective story set in post-Hurricane Katrina New Orleans.

Let me count the ways.1. Setting: Post-Katrina New Orleans. Swampy, sensual, tragic, dangerous. A complete immersion into the sights, sounds, smells and tastes of a damaged and depressed city, betrayed and forgotten, seeking its redemption.2. Heroine: Kick-ass, ruthless, complicated, haunted. Claire DeWitt is much like the city of New Orleans itself: damaged and dangerous, tragic and seeking redemption. Neither needs nor desires your pity or understanding. 3. Language: Hard-boiled dialogue that snaps and shows its teeth, married with gorgeous turns of phrase and a robust philosophy about the very nature of solving mysteries. The client already knows the solution to his mystery. But he doesn't want to know. He doesn't hire a detective to solve his mystery. He hires a detective to prove that his mystery can't be solved. 4. Mystery: I don't read a lot of \"mysteries\" where there is a genuine, bona fide puzzle to be solved. I'm not a clue junkie hoarding each item the author throws down in an effort to beat him or her to the big reveal. Here, I really felt compelled to sit up straight and pay attention. It didn't take very long before I became incredibly invested in Claire's investigation and its outcome, no mere detached observer but something akin to an actual participant. Despite the fact that Claire's methods are anything but conventional -- bordering on mystical and clairvoyant -- the investigation remains firmly grounded in reality and logic. I adore how everything comes together in a satisfying \"click\" \"snap\" \"lock\" way that isn't pretty and predictable, but all the more beautiful for that very reason. Finally, I can't do this book justice on my own so I'm going to call in the big guns. Without these two reviews I don't think I ever would have found my way to Claire.

In addition to the investigative skills utilized by most normal detectives, Claire relies on her dreams, the I Ching and an awful lot of dope to set her on the path to a truth her client and a lot of others may not wish to hear. The investigation also takes her into the local gangsta culture where she develops some strange alliances and makes some dangerous enemies.In Claire, Sara Gran has created an amazing new incarnation of the private detective and may, single-handedly, reinvigorate the genre.

It's also brilliant, delightful, delicious, and an absolute joy to read, full of the most unexpected cadences and rhythms, rife with surprising plot twists, witty dialogue, sudden moments of wrenching poignancy ... all the more effecting for their surreal aspects.

I have a few upsets with this book. When I say a few, I mean probably ten. First of all the main character Claire Dewitt isn\u2019t a badass at all, but the story attempts to write her as such. One scene in particular she speaks of walking upon several gang-banger guys who are armed to the teeth, and in the author\u2019s words \u201cwith enough to take on Fallujah\u201d. The main character says, \u201cthey were tough, but I was tougher,\u201d and then says she was thankful for the .38 in her purse. Okay, what the heck was she going to do with a .38 when each of these gang members had loads of firepower. Secondly, this chick was addicted to every sort of drug and alcohol product in the book. Yeah, that makes for an excellent private investigator. Can you imagine, \u201cOh, yeah I\u2019m trustworthy, I\u2019ll get right on your case just as soon as I smoke this bowl and shoot up real quick, oh and can you help me tie off please?\u201d I can only assume that this character\u2019s next novel will be called, Claire Dewitt and the Missing Needles: The Rehab Casefiles. Thirdly, she states several times in the book that she is the \u201cgreatest detective\u201d in the world and she is constantly referencing a guy named Jacques Sillette who wrote a book called Detetcion (French guy/French book). A book that she says is \u201cextremely\u201d rare and yet it keeps turning up\u2026\u2026like everywhere.Next, I\u2019d like to talk about the \u201cshe-just-so-happens-to-always-run-into-the-same-characters\u201d in New Orleans. It\u2019s one thing to talk to someone and they say, \u201coh that guy you are looking for works at such and such place and then you head there and what a surprise he\u2019s there. But, oh no! Not Claire Dewitt, when she is looking for some guy, usually Andre, she rolled a pair of dice, and got a 7. That is miraculous, because everyone knows in craps 7 comes up a lot, but for Miss Dewitt, that means she has take 7th street! Wow!! Then by the by, who do you think would be on the front porch of some random house on 7th street? The exact person she is looking for. This happens over and over and over, in the book. \u201cI looked up and it was Andre\u2026\u201d \u201cAndre was there\u2026\u201d, \u201cI looked over and it was Andre so we shared a joint\u2026\u201d I\u2019ve never been to New Orleans, but it\u2019s not that small of a town that you would see the same guy, EVERYWHERE!Clues! This detective woman is supposed to be looking for clues for a murder/missing person. And according to Detetcion, clues are everywhere including the first random clue found. She is having lunch with her client Leon at the beginning, and the waiter comes by and drops the check for the meal and when he picks it up for her, stuck to the bottom of the bill is a business card and the character clearly says, \u201cThe first clue\u201d, but being the \"greatest detective\" in the world she doesn\u2019t even follow up on this lead. Albeit as silly as it came into her possession. That\u2019s like saying I was working on a case and decided to take a crap at a McDonalds and as I was washing my hands and I saw the clue of all clues near the trash can next to the wall-stall urinal. SO STUPID!! I should have stopped listening to this book at that point, but I kept listening hoping for it to get better. (<-- definition of insanity closely resembles that last statement)Word usage is extremely irritating in this book. Not just the boring conversations that go nowhere for five minutes and people keep repeating themselves over and over and over and over and over and over, like I\u2019m doing right now. Here is a taste of what I endured:\u201cNo!\u201d she said.\u201cYes, I need to speak with him!\u201d I said.\u201cNo!\u201d she said.\u201cBut it\u2019s important!\u201d I said.\u201cNo!\u201d she said.\u201cJust tell him it\u2019s Claire.\u201d I said.\u201cNo!\u201d she said.\u201cIt\u2019s a matter of life and death.\u201d I said.\u201cNo!\u201d she said.\u201cI really need to speak with him now.\u201d I said.\u201cNo!\u201d she said.(Anyone else placing a gun to their temple yet?)I changed the scene a bit, but it happens like this all the time, you get the point\u201dListening to the audio made it more frustrating for me, \u201cI said\u201d \u201cshe said\u201d \u201che said\u201d \u201cI said\u201d. Almost, every single line was followed up by those pronouns-then verb. To say repetitive and irritating would be understatements. Greatest detective my BUTT!! So there is this one scene, she goes up to a group of guys/kids and says she is a P.I., oh and she once again says she is amazing at it. She demonstrates her, ah..., skills by asking one of the kids to say something personal about himself. He responds, \u201cMy sister used to call me Nay-nay.\u201d Then Claire uses her \u201cinsight\u201d, \u201cYou were raised by your uncle, you moved from Alabama, you had three siblings, your parents left you when you were a kid, you had a gout flare when you were nine, and you had chicken cordon bleu for supper three nights ago.\u201d I\u2019m paraphrasing that last part, but you see what I'm talking about! So this is a sampling of her talent. Yet, here lies the mystery to me. She can tell this whole kid\u2019s life story after hearing a nickname, but when she spends hours and hours in the home of the missing/murdered individual she has no clue where this guy is. I\u2019ll let you in on a little info or as you like to call it a \u201cclue\u201d, Miss Dewitt, there is a reason you aren\u2019t a Mentalist like Simon Baker, it\u2019s the drug use. You have smoked yourself stupid, and perhaps so brain dead you are the only one who believes you are an awesome\u2026or should I say \"the greatest detective\" in the world. (YAWN) Much like the rotation of weed at a frat party, I\u2019ll be passing on this grass for subsequent novels. So to sum up, like the \u201c7\u201d Claire Dewitt rolled, this book craps out just the same!

It's a crime novel, but with hints of the supernatural, whose heroine heavily uses drugs and solves crimes out of an obsessive need. A strange book by a strange man is the lifeline, the heartbeat through the story that holds all the little separate pieces of plot together. There are three mysteries here: The surface (a man searching for his missing uncle), the catalyst (Claire DeWitt's missing friend) and the undercurrent of everything (a famous detective's missing daughter).Set in New Orleans, just after the storm, the story sinks to the murkiest depths of that city, the people in it, and while it's there, pretty much all of humanity for good measure. There is humour, but it's not a happy book; and there is an ending, satisfying enough, but not a happy one.I don't know if darkness like this is (unusually) what I need right now, as much as I want to uncover the mystery of Claire's missing friend, and Jacques Silette's daughter.

Who'd have thought it would have it's own manual? Claire Dewitt learned at the feet of an apparent master who used the manual in teaching her students the way of living as well as the ways of detecting. As Claire tells us: \"Silette wrote one book, Detection, in 1959. Jaques Silette  was a genius. So I thought. So a few thousand others around the world thought too.\" (loc 344)This was the man who created her bible, the book that gave meaning to her life, the very frazzled life she lived, trying to decipher other people's mysteries.Per Silette, \"There are no innocent victims....The victim selects his  role as carefully and unconsciously as the policeman, the  detective, the client, or the villain. Each chooses his role and then forgets this, sometimes for many lifetimes, until one comes along who can remind him. This time you may be  the villain or the victim. The next time your roles may  switch. It is only a role. Try to remember.\" (loc 344)Claire has returned to New Orleans to solve a missing person mystery. This is a city she has a history with and no longer loves. It's not long after Katrina and the city and lives are a mess. The mystery she comes to solve proves to be a mess too. She is unlike any detective I've experienced before, using methods and the universe at large to help her.I love many of the quotes from Detection and will give a couple here. \"Clues are the most misunderstood part of detection. Novice detectives think it's about finding clues. But detective work is about recognizing clues. \"Clues are everywhere. But only some can see.\" (loc 644) \"There are no coincidence,\" Silette wrote. \"Only mysteries that haven't been solved, clues that haven't  been placed. Most are blind to the language of the bird overhead, the leaf in our path, the phonographic record stuck in a groove, the unknown caller on the phone. They don't see the omens. They don't know how to read the signs. \"To them life is like a book with blank pages. But to the detective, it is an illuminated manuscript of mysteries.\" (loc 812)There are too many more and you should discover them for yourself as you experience Claire DeWitt attempting to solve this case in post-Katrina New Orleans.

It also shares genre tropes with those highly unbelievable cozy mysteries in which detectives are celebrated celebrities around the world known for solving cases such as The Murder on the Blue Train and The Jewels of Aunt Marjie. And then there's the child detective all grown up and living with failure and drug addiction - see the wonderful Boy Detective Fails perhaps? - plus the humour and investigative style of Douglas Adams' Dirk Gently who solves his cases through the interconnectedness of all things and you're coming close forming an idea of the wonderful and wilfully strange world of Claire DeWitt. It's such a fantastic melange of styles that will surely have literary noir fans squealing with joy and I can't wait to insist that my friend Ben reads this when he catches up on all the \"required noir reading\" I gave him. You can't rush James Crumley afterall.This is a post-Katrina noir that spends as much time discussing the aftermath of that particular disaster as it does unravelling its plot, there's all sorts of post traumatic stress on display, questions raised over the failing of the infrastructure supposedly in place to provide aid and the desire of a city's people to recover plus it doubles as a tour guide in to a hell on Earth that America apparently has no interest in fixing. Sara Gran juggles all of these balls with consummate skill, flair and even a fair amount of humour despite the subject matter. If the world of literature was a fair place she would deserve all of the financial success of your common Gillian Flynn but alas at the moment she must survive with the adoration of the relative few."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16002711-anna", "userReview": "OK, this is a great book.

I find that very important.The setting, New Orleans after \u201cthe storm\u201d:The streets of the Lower Ninth Ward were caked in grayish-brown dried mud. So was everything else. Nothing had been cleaned. Little bits of people\u2019s lives were scattered around in between the piles of rubble: a shoe, a book, a bra. The smell was bad: garbage and mold and death. Some houses had been pushed into each other, making indistinguishable piles of rubble. Some had boats or cars or trailers or pieces of other houses on top of them or stuck into them, forced into strange angles by the strength of the water. There were boats on top of roofs and cars on top of houses.The boys:We looked at each other. His long, serious face looked tired. Tired of fighting, tired of keeping secrets, tired, probably, of living in a world where if you say the wrong thing to the wrong person, you die.Claire DeWitt:Leon had fired me.

Then Constance Darling died, leaving Claire as her heir to the title of greatest detective in the world.It's hard to say how tongue-in-cheek Claire is being when she calls herself that, but she states it in a flat, no-nonsense manner that makes people believe it because she seems to. And she really is, as it turns out, freakishly good at what she does, though I Ching and tea leaves notwithstanding, whatever supernatural help she receives is as likely to be the result of the drugs she does not hesitate to sample as the spirit of her departed mentor.Claire is hired to find out what happened to a New Orleans lawyer who has disappeared, by his nephew. One of Claire's first observations is that clients rarely actually want you to solve their mystery for them, and this proves to be true. Claire's case takes her through the still flood-devastated streets of New Orleans, uncovering trouble and secrets people would rather she not uncover, and when she solves the case, no one is happy. Pretty much as she expected.Claire's voice is dry, wise, and occasionally sarcastic. She operates on intuition, mysticism, and drugs. She's tough but not a superwoman, and she seems to have connections everywhere. The other characters are equally vivid and flawed and contain multitudes, even the missing lawyer who is never seen on-page.This was a quick read that is just your basic mystery with a quirky lady detective on the surface, but contains hidden depths.

The case is to find out what happened to this the city\u2019s wealthy district attorney who disappeared during the flooding after the hurricane.Every now and then, an author comes along with a voice and style that it is almost impossible to describe, quantify, or explain. That was my reaction to Ms. Gran\u2019s first book, \u201cClaire DeWitt and the City of the Dead\u201d. At its heart, it\u2019s a classic hard-boiled mystery, complete with drugs, guns, liquor and bad guys.

She\u2019s from Brooklyn, she knows death and drugs and liquor. She\u2019s not a comfortable protagonist. We learn details of her past and life throughout the story. What is interesting is that every character Gran creates is vivid and memorable, including those who don\u2019t exist such as Constance and Silette. It\u2019s a story that doesn\u2019t really have any minor players, only short scene.Gran\u2019s descriptions are powerful. New Orleans is a city unlike any other yet, particularly in this time setting, she does not make any effort to romanticize it. It is ugly, violent, sad, desperate and very real. Remarkably, however, at the end we\u2019re left with a sense of hope, both for the city and the characters.

Who will fill his seat at the university lecture, the foot ball game, in the old armchair at home?...\u201d Gran has a different perspective than I\u2019ve ever found.The story\u2019s plot may not always be the easiest to follow, but it is so worth paying attention to every word and every clue and giving each page a bit of thought. That\u2019s easy to do as it is thoroughly and completely engrossing. There are times it may seem trite or pretentious, but you then find yourself going back and reading sections again because something about them resonates.

This happened post-Katrina so naturally that makes things complex from the beginning; a city and its people devastated, nobody trustful of anybody from the outside...Was he killed? Drown during Katrina? What happened to him?I'm wondering what makes Clair DeWitt 'the world's greatest detective'. Apparently for her it was a calling, not a choice. Clair, graduate from a mental hospital, high school drop out, avid drug and alcohol user and master of sarcasm and treating other people like dirt learned the trade from her deceased mentor who in turn learned from a book, Detecion' written by 'France's greatest detective' in the 70s. Passages from this life altering book crop out constantly throughout the book...they read more like philosophical mumbo jumbo than anything else. The fact that the book just keeps turning up in the darnedest places (a book that's said to be pretty rare by the way) makes on scratch one's head.Clair closes in on what really happened to the subject of the mystery as the story progresses through judicious usage of pot, booze and embalming fluid laced joints that are all the rage amongst the gangs and homeless in the area.As I write this I find myself comparing Clair DeWitt to Gregory House from the television show. Great at the job, complete and utter train wreck in personal life and awful with just about everyone they run into. Problem is, she's like house times a hundred. I found myself not really liking her at all. Her detecting methods seem to be some combination of mystical mojo and intuition I couldn't quite figure out, usually emphasized by much use of controlled substances and in her lucid moments, she pretty much browbeats everyone she encounters with sarcasm.The mystery itself? It was ok. I didn't find much real suspense and as with some of her previous work I didn't think 'wow, I just HAVE to find out what happens next!', because I knew with every page turn there would be more Clair DeWitt and more mumbo jumbo from her Detective's Bible.I don't mind damaged characters, in fact I find them the most interesting to read but they should at least have something likable about them and I really couldn't find much to like about Clair DeWitt. The inside jacket of the book said that this is the beginning of a new series. Will I give the next one a shot? I think so, clearly because I know Sara Gran can write something I can really enjoy, and who knows? Maybe the more we learn about her and the events that make her so damaged the more interesting she'll become.So I'll consider this one a stumble out of the gate and hope we see some more detecting in the next one and maybe a little less revelation via acid trip."}, {"userName": "Ed", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1077703-ed", "userReview": "It's refreshing to run across an offbeat, stylish, and sparky private eye novel like City of the Dead is.

Bo Bradley would go off her medication in order to access the flashes of intuitive insight she needed to solve her cases. Unfortunately, this would make some of her actions and decisions erratic, and she would get into trouble with her superiors. Claire DeWitt isn't on prescription medication but she does use certain uncontrolled substances which cause her to lose her judgment and the trust of people working with her. For me, the positive consequence of her mental instability is her visions and dreams which can inspire new directions for her investigations. She also utilizes the I Ching.The investigative tool in Claire's arsenal that I found most interesting is the book Detection which is a fictional creation of the author. Detection is continually quoted throughout the book and copies of this volume show up unexpectedly. Detection doesn't focus on techniques, but on the mental/emotional attitude of the investigator, and the philosophy behind investigation. I also was really impressed by the author's perspective on the New Orleans setting. She showed me that the city was really already dysfunctional before Katrina hit. Here's a quote that I found insightful:\"Some people I saw, had drowned right away. And some people were drowning in slow motion, drowning a little bit at a time and would be drowning for years. And some people, like Mick, had always been drowning. They just hadn't known what to call it until now.\"With all the character complexities and atmospheric detail, the case seems almost incidental to the narrative. It's as if the case provides an excuse for the author to play with this character and this setting. This is why I didn't give the book five stars.

I don't really even have the words for it. It is worthy entrant into the Canon on mystery novels (such as it is.) I have read so many god-damned books where the author is declared to be a worthy successor to chandler or hammett, and with the exception of robert b. parker at his pinnacle, or robert crais, at his pinnacle, I have always been disapointed.* And this book wasn't even advertised as the worthy successor to hammett. But oh my is it ever. The novel is so very brilliant because it succeeds on three levels. The first, it is a precise encoding of the experience we want to have when we read mystery novels. The identity of the Detective is important. Detectives are born, not made--they discover in themselves the need to find the Truth, and from there it is pre-ordained that they shall, in time, find themselves working as licensed private eyes.** In this world, mysteries are Named and have registered: The Murder on Rue Temple, The Mystery of the Green Parrot. The detective who is wary of the cluesbeing presented cannot help but find the truth, even when, inevitably, the truth is something no one wants to hear. Secondly, the novel is a noirish, The Wire influenced portrait of post-Katrina New Orleans.*** The ruined city truly comes to life with vivid descriptions of city before during and after \"The Storm,\" as do each of the rich and complex characters. No one in this novel is really good, but no one is entirely evil either. Thirdly, the novel lays seeds for a truly awesome saga. Although the central Mystery (the Mystery of the Green Parrot) isthoroughly resolved, there are many Mysteries that are introduced but not solved. Better still, there is a tantalizing preview into what's next for Claire Dewitt, which although it is foreshadowed early is not truly revelaed until the end and i will say, it's a doozy. I simply cannot wait for the next Claire Dewitt novel. My obligatory complaints? I found Claire DeWitt's pervasive drug use and mysticism vaguely irritating. A few of the plot pieces could have been better integrated. But these are minor: I am deeply impressed by the writing in the book. Seriously, is the next one out yet?

Recovering from a recent breakdown, Claire receives a call from Leon, a man down in New Orleans. Leon's uncle Vic has gone missing after Hurricane Katrina and he wants help to find out what happened to Vic. Claire used to live in New Orleans, when she was being mentored in the art of detection by another student of Jacques Silette, Constance. Claire has many memories of those times, some good, some awful, and a good deal of her own life's mystery needs to be shaken out and examined while she is back in New Orleans.The mystery to be solved involves the kids of New Orleans, the forgotten ones, the kids in the Wards, the ones who got left off or disappeared from the foster rosters. Their struggle to survive during the storm and their lives in the aftermath are part of the weave in the web of this mystery.

[By the way, ten years later, people are still hurting, big time.] Many are gone; not all are accounted for. She tries to figure out what happened to one such person. Along the way she spends a lot of time and energy with young people who began hurting long before Katrina, and are now that much worse for wear. These young people are not easy to be with. But then, neither is Dewitt.I felt New Orleans as I read, and the pain we all saw in the media during the long-lasting disaster. She also captured the strength and tenacity of those who have long called New Orleans home. DeWitt's approach is decidedly not mainstream and does have a touch of the mystical, thankfully without the nonsense of the current supernatural genre. I have to say that against all reason, I loved this book and look forward to reading more from Gran."}, {"userName": "Nikki", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3616022-nikki", "userReview": "Ever been to New Orleans?

Now you don\u2019t have to read the book. Claire is ballsy and I\u2019d kind of love to get drinks with her, but when it comes to New Orleans, she has only one thing to say. We get it. New Orleans is the Pit of Despair. Don\u2019t even think about trying to escape. The chains are far too thick. But aside from the dreary atmosphere, this so-called mystery was ho-hum as hell."}, {"userName": "Zora", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8291584-zora", "userReview": "I think this novel might just be a work of genius.Is the protagonist/narrator a hard-boiled PI with some mystical abilities, Chandler doused in Taoism? Or is she a schizophrenic, self-medicated with street drugs, who has invented half of what she tells us? I don't know\u2026and I like that I don't know.Claire DeWitt moves through the underworld of New Orleans, just after Katrina, to find a missing ADA. She uses, in her detection, old frienemies, new acquaintances, street people, Mardi Gras \"Indians,\" her dreams, and most crucially, the book \"Detection,\" a mystical French tome that is more philosophy than how-to, known by the rare few meant to know it. It says that the answers to any mysteries are all around you this moment; you only need to look and see them correctly, and that no one wants the answers to the mysteries, really. The excerpts from \"Detection\" read something like Taoists texts such as the I Ching (which is referenced here, too, but not the real I Ching I've read various translations of, but some odd version Gran has, I assume, invented for her own reasons). And they apply not only to the case, but to everything about Claire, in convoluted and clever ways.Those philosophies end up calling into question (along with Claire's descriptions of her craziness, half-admitted, half-denied) how much of the narrative is real. Is there really such a book as \"Detection\" at all? Is Claire's childhood friend missing or actually dead (and Claire knows it, saw it, or perhaps even did it?) Not a page goes by where there aren't two possible readings of a fictional event, and this is where the cleverness of the book lies. Claire clearly is an unreliable narrator\u2026but exactly how unreliable is she?The prose is rock solid, lucid stuff, the dialog terrific and the secondary characters interestingly flawed. Gran is a good observer of people. So even if you take it at the surface level of the hard-boiled PI novel, it's a good read, offering a rich and nuanced background for the mystery and page-turning prose\u2026but there's so much more to it than that (and I think some reviewers here missed those other levels). The novel itself becomes a sort of koan, calling into question reality, sanity, good and evil.You know what my reaction reminded me of?--the first time I saw _Being John Malkovich_, before the sexism in it began to trouble me, when I thought, I think I'm in the presence of a true creative innovator here who is taking not into this world at all, into some odd parallel version of this world whose unreality illuminates my own reality. What I understood here--and I get the sense I didn't \"get\" everything Gran offers--was impressive. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/315825-kelly", "userReview": "I'm not sure where to start. How about with this: I don't recommend this book.There aren't any likeable characters. In fact, I could care less if they all died. Which, you know, seems entirely possible given how they live. I'm surprised that the \"greatest detective in the world\" is able to function at all when most of her time is spent high, or drunk, or both. Much of the rest of her time is devoted to ridiculous attempts to discern truth using omens, dice, or dreams. Actually, we could break it down:Claire DeWitt's Actions50% substance abuse25% superstition, mysticism, & charlatanism15% unnecessary bad language10% fumbling around town and accidentally figuring stuff outWhen you realize that these things have an undercurrent of fear, anger, bitterness, loneliness, and despair, well... It doesn't make for a very likeable or believable \"greatest detective in the world\", as she repeatedly claims for herself.The writing itself- the structure of the novel and the methods used to tell the story- is so convoluted and mystical that the book felt like a dream. (Or a nightmare.) It was disjointed and relied heavily on quotes from Claire's favorite book, which is an invention of Gran's. It could have been a clever device; instead, it was overdone, and the text nonsensical. I guess that's why Claire loves it so much; she seems to be very much part of the \"What is truth?\" school of thought.There's a heavy emphasis on the drowning theme, which makes sense, given the setting of post-Katrina New Orleans. I'm left wondering if the book is a cry for help. So many of the characters are in deep misery and despair, unable to help themselves or figure out what is good and true, drowning in wickedness and sorrow. Claire is drowning, too. In the end, there's no redemption. Just a temporary reprieve."}, {"userName": "Lea", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3397530-lea", "userReview": "3.5 Stars . . .But I may change that after I've had time to think about it for a while . . .This is beautifully written, and a very fast read -- lots of tiny chapters, which makes it easy to work through if you don't have a lot of time.I saw so many reviewers that I really respect giving this book great reviews, and I have to say that, even though I didn't have the same reaction, I don't disagree with them. Claire DeWitt is a very intriguing character, and the story is fast paced and interesting.I think one reason I didn't like the book as well as so many other people did is because I didn't realize going into it that it's an actual mystery. I thought it was more of a fantasy book, because of the main character's unconventional methods of detection. Flat out mystery isn't a genre I read much of, so that threw me a little. I kept waiting for the whimsy! And the magic! No.Another problem I had was that I just didn't connect with Claire. We're seeing all of the action from her point of view, but it feels like she's working very hard to keep people (including readers) from knowing too much about her. She's interesting more than likable, and I guess I really prefer to like my protagonists.The main feeling I got from this book was an overwhelming sadness -- although I really don't think that was the author's intent. I think -- like Claire -- we're supposed to see a bigger picture, where while there may not be a conventionally happy ending, there is still hope. And maybe I will see that bigger picture tomorrow. But for tonight, at least, this one left me feeling very blue."}], "description": "Sara Gran has written a novel about an unprecedented private investigator named Claire DeWitt. Destiny, it seems, has chosen Claire to be a detective, planting a copy of the enigmatic book D\u00e9tection in her path as a teenager. Claire has grabbed this destiny with both hands but fate has been cruel. Twenty years later detection is her religion and D\u00e9tection is her Bible. Now she is summoned to New Orleans, because someone has heard she is \"the best,\" to search for an upstanding citizen lost in the miasma of Katrina. The battered and beggared New Orleans, second only to Claire, is the star of this story. Thus the title. The style is slick, gripping, and mystical, as strange and as easy as the character of Claire DeWitt. You may be repelled by her earthiness or mesmerized by her off-the-wall devotion to her calling. Though planned as the beginning of a series, Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead is itself a complete novel.", "title": "Claire DeWitt and the City of the Dead\n      \n          (Claire DeWitt Mysteries #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9231999-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1312909281l/9231999.jpg", "reviews": 993, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/50690.Sara_Gran", "name": "Sara Gran"}], "type": ["Mystery", "Fiction", "Mystery", "Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9231999-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11575783-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11451486-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11886697-city-of-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22747153-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9820234-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12804911-claire-dewitt-and-the-city-of-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/220772.Come_Closer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15814401-claire-dewitt-and-the-bohemian-highway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/525677.Dope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/525651.Saturn_s_Return_to_New_York", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38532150-the-infinite-blacktop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37581710-the-company-of-demons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40024832-empire-of-sin", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8343548-the-bricklayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193155-among-the-wicked", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23818400-the-snow-garden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23157833-almost-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33555347-crime-scene", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30249521-fatal-frost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266676-remains-of-innocence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34330657-finding-claire-fletcher", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28824403-outfoxed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23957469-huntress-moon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204087-the-deepest-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35115882-what-the-dead-know", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40267317-ragdoll", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35914878-pretty-dead-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39791173-the-girl-before", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205081-last-witness", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205040-dead-weight", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903409-weekend-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193809-eye-for-an-eye", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27239265-the-short-drop", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623604-you-only-live-twice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377392-thunderball", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17284593-casino-royale", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17623578-for-your-eyes-only", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193858-the-cuckoo-s-calling", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17304110-live-and-let-die", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18780375-dr-no", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192926-black-flowers-white-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17379070-moonraker", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18799804-diamonds-are-forever", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205231-the-spy-who-loved-me", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17377384-from-russia-with-love", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243961-the-cape-refuge-collection"]}
