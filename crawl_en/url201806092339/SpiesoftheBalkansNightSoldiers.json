Don\u2019t tell anyone. It is 1939. In the strategic Greek port city of Salonika, rumblings of war can be heard as Nazi Germany gains allies by threat and force. People wonder only when the invasion will come. Costa Zinnis is the head of a special political branch of the police, charged with discretely managing the problems of the connected and keeping his finger on the pulse of the town. And there is plenty going on. Spies abound. A mysterious German accepts an envelope in a dark alley. Zinnis and his second pursue and the game is afoot. Zinnis is the core here, and a solid one. The character is both tough and appealing in the classic spy noir style, but is a bit shorter in the damaged department that that formula suggests. He loves his mother, younger brother and dog, Melissa, who is a very welcome element. There are many fine supporting players here. A wealthy German Jewish woman needs help smuggling Jews out of Germany. Zinnis\u2019 lady friend, a Brit, owns and runs a dance school, and hangs with the Salonika movers and shakers. But is she more than she appears? His rabbi in the police is a wonderful creation, an 80-something with solid connections and a clear view ahead. A suspicious British \u201ctravel writer\u201d makes the rounds, as do an assortment of folks from the Greek and Hungarian criminal classes. Zinnis teams up with a foreign policeman to try to affect the course of political change. It is all very hush-hush, and all very much fun to read. Of course no spy story would be complete without a femme fatale, and Spies of the Balkans does not disappoint, although I found that element one of the weaker ones. The attraction may have fit in with the love-at-first-sight expectations one has of such tales, but it seemed forced to me, at least on his end. The payload here is a look at what life was like in late 1930s Greece while waiting for the other shoe to drop. Mussolini, threatening to invade, is eager to keep up with his mustached German buddy, groups within nations vie for political advantage, nations look to serve their own interests at the cost of their neighbors, preparations are made for resistance. The war years are like the Bible in that the tales are eternal. Furst has written eleven novels in his \u201cNight Soldiers\u201d series about (mostly) Eastern Europe during World War II. Spies of the Balkans is the latest. While reading Spies of the Balkans one cannot help but visualize the events in glorious black and white, so well does Furst capture the right feel for the genre. In the same way one wonders what Rick and Louis might get up to after Lazlo and Ilsa take flight, Spies of the Balkans leaves one wanting more. This is a fast, fun and engaging read. The secret is out."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1289391-michael", "userReview": "Furst set a very high standard for himself early in his career. He clearly owns the period from 1933-45 in Europe and is a very fine writer of historical fiction filled with intrigue and likeable characters. Over the last few years, however, he has slipped into a formulaic pattern that takes few risks and delivers few surprises. I'm not concerned with those formulaic elements that function as trademarks (protagonists who never die, Table 14 in the Brasserie Heininger in Paris with its mirror marked by a bullet hole, characters who reappear in different novels). It's more of an impression that he's started writing by the numbers -- filling in the blanks on a template because it works (at least in that it sells books). I still read everything he writes, because a mediocre Furst novel is better than the best efforts of 90% of best-selling novelists. I just want him to challenge himself a little more, to get out of his comfort zone and take some real risks as a novelist. The novelist who wrote The Polish Officer, Dark Star, Red Gold, and The World at Night is still in there somewhere, despite such mediocrities as The Foreign Correspondent. When I read Furst, I want to listen for the footsteps on the stair, to hold my breath while waiting for the knock on the door, to look anxiously over my shoulder at the black sedan crawling down a dark street -- I want to feel fear and to care passionately about what happens to people I feel I know. I want more than boilerplate scenarios translated from one European city to another. I don't want Furst to become another Bernard Cornwell, who keeps on churning out the prose after the creativity has died. One of the problems with success is that it encourages an inclination to repeat what works and a fear of failure that stifles creativity. In the meantime, I'll keep buying the books Furst writes in the hope that the fire has not gone out for good. The latest novel is better than a number of more recent ones, but it shows a few worrying trends, including talking down to the reader. I submit that anyone who needs the following explanation in the text shouldn't be reading a novel set in World War II: \"'. . . the Geheime Staatspolizei.' An official title, the secret state police, simply one more government organization. But in Germany it was common usage to abbreviate this title, which came out 'Gestapo.'\" I'd like to think this was the idiotic idea of an inexperienced editor. If so, one would think Random House could do better. Roald Dahl was one of the last pilots to fly in defense of Greece during the German invasion. His account of that experience could give Furst a few pointers about how to write a nail-biting, palm-sweating story about Greece as the Nazi night descended."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1895570-jim", "userReview": "No, these are not the Eric Ambler Balkans, though both series of books are set around the same time, and both involve spying. Spies of the Balkans is another of Alan Furst's looks at the inevitable start of World War Two.In this book, the hero is Constantine Zannis, a highly placed police officer in the Greek city of Salonika. He sees the storm clouds of war gather and make their way south to the Northern border of Greece. Early in the book, he finds one way of depriving the Nazis of their prey: \"arresting\" Jews, taking them back to Salonika, and forwarding them on to Turkey and other places. He even smuggles a fallen British pilot from Paris to Greece via Bulgaria.I am amazed that Furst can produce such a coherent and atmospheric series of spy thrillers with all different characters and countries. The advantage, of course, is that one does not need to start with the first novel in the series and follow the main character's development across multiple books. No, indeed, one can start anywhere. But above all, one should start. These are great books for summer reading."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\u201cAnd, with much of Europe occupied by Nazi Germany, and Mussolini's armies in Albania, on the Greek frontier, one wasn't sure what came next. So, don't trust the telephone. Or the newspapers. Or the radio. Or tomorrow.\u201d \u2015 Alan Furst, Spies of the Balkans(***1/2) I loved enjoyed 'Spies of the Balkans' (Night Soldiers #11). It wasn't Furst's best in the series, but it was a sweet Kata\u00effi of a novel. Emotionally it fed me. Furst highlights the little things people do with just a nudge here and a twist there to make a dark world just a bit better. 'Spies of the Balkans' focuses on the sacrifices people made during fascism's push into Southern Europe. The novel's center of gravity is Costa Zannis, a senior police official in Salonika, who sometimes finds his talents needed by both the Jews seeking to escape Germany and British spy networks. It is a novel that drips with the hidden goodness of those amazing men and women who refused to let dark circumstances dictate their character.For reference, I've included below the 14 books of the Night Soldiers series along with my star rating:  1.

Furst's first (heh) was Night Soldiers, a massive epic of war and espionage, probably the best novel about spies in the Second World War you're likely to read. But in many ways it set the parameters for his subsequent works, while Red Gold set the template. None of the other books have been as epic - except inasmuch as anything touched by the Second World War is touched by the epic - tighter, briefer, sharper, more focused. Few of them go past 1941 or '42 in timeframe. At first this can seem disappointing and the books begin to seem samey and repetitive. But, like O'Brian, they are only samey and repetitive in terms of theme and format. The broad strokes of the War are, to us, predetermined. Within those strokes wind the lives of the men and women in the secret, murky world of espionage. Describing these lives is what Furst excels at, and he has perfected that style and format. If Night Soldiers was his Epic, these are his sonnets.Our setting is Salonika, 1940. Our slightly shabby, vaguely disreputable, incurably romantic hero is Consta Zannis, a police officer responsible for peacefully resolving knotty political difficulties. He becomes involved in a secret route for Jews and dissidents fleeing Berlin. Time, of course, is running out, and the question is how long the route can be kept open, and whether it can survive the attentions of the British Secret Service.Drenched in atmosphere, heroism and romanticism, with doom coming down on all sides and the shady, shadowy world of criminals and spies and secret lovers intermingling, this is thrilling, tragic, marvelous stuff. A kind of escapism, sure, but of such elegance and subtlety and the sense of intelligent people making small gestures in the face of unstoppable evil, it always leaves you wanting more."}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "Furst has a talent for capturing the lesser known regions touched by World War II. Spies of the Balkans is no exception. We meet Zannis, a Greek detective who is assigned the most delicate tasks by the Commissioner of Police, a shadowy figure named Vangelis. Greece is at war with Italy and winning. It is only a matter of time before Hitler will not allow the Axis powers to be weak in any manner by going to the aid of Mussolini's troops. Meanwhile, Zannis will become involved in assisting the escape of Jews from Germany by establishing a Balkan escape route, recruiting law enforcement officers from Balkan nations. Zannis will be recruited by the English for missions as far away as France. The pace is fast. The story is complex. The characters are captivating.

The story takes place mostly in Salonika, Greece in early 1940. Hitler is grabbing up real estate as fast as he can and Mussolini is trying to emulate his ally by invading Albania. Greece comes to Albania's aid and inflicts a number of defeats on Il Duce's armies. Everyone believes that Hitler will either dominate or invade the countries of the Balkans. The protagonist, Costa Zannis, a senior police official, who has a special status must deal with spies from all the warring countries. Additionally he despises the Germans, partially because of their treatment of the Jews, so he helps set up an escape route for Jewish refugees, through Slovakia, Hungary and Yugoslavia to Salonika, where they can be put on a boat for Turkey. He has an active love life that becomes torrid and dangerous when he begins an affair with the wife of one of the most powerful businessmen in Salonika. He also feels responsible for the safety of his extended family and his subordinates, all of whom are in danger of being targeted by the Nazis, when they inevitably invade Greece. The book is populated by an incredible mix of characters including city political officials, detectives from various countries, a wealthy Jewish woman from Berlin, protected because her husband is a high ranking officer in the Wehrmacht, members of the Gestapo, refugees from the German insanity, officers and soldiers, prostitutes, diplomatic personnel and many others. It is a mark of Furst's incredible talent that he can bring such people alive and obviously understands their motivations and fears. The plot never stretches credibility. People, including Zannis, are afraid of what will happen if they get caught, yet, like so many others, he persists in doing the right thing even at risk of his life. Interestingly, even the Gestapo agents are not unremittingly evil They are just trying to get along in the Germany they live in. The evil is diluted as it moves down the food chain and sometimes bad things are done just so the perpetrator can maintain his life and protect his own family. The appeal of the book also lies in its description of the Balkans during the early stages of WW II. Furst must be an incredible researcher to uncover the situation in such an under-appreciated part of the world. The struggles of the Greeks, the Slavs, and others are no less inspiring than that of the French resistance or the British defiance. We just don't know that much about them. I'm hoping it won't be too long before Furst publishes another offering. His style and mastery of both plot and characterization, make his books literature as much or more than almost all thrillers, I've read."}, {"userName": "Tony", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1361000-tony", "userReview": "Furst, Alan.

He and his partner, Gabi Saltiel, are responsible for dealing with crimes that are involved with the rich and famous or that present delicate political implications. Suddenly he finds himself in the middle of an escape railroad for Jews from Germany. He is used to facilitate their entry into Greece and then on to Turkey or Egypt. He is succumbed into this role by a woman who he has a brief affair with who turns out to be an agent based in Germany visiting Greece. He encounters a series of threats to his work on the railroad and is even asked to go to France to somehow rescue a RAF pilot who was shot down and was being hidden by partisans. This pilot was also an important scientist in England who had detailed knowledge of the development of England\u2019s radar system. The story telling is smooth and the plot is composed of well-knit episodes of spy/counterspy that will keep you reading on into the night.

However, the good stuff first\u2026pun unintended. All of his novels take place in Europe during the \u201830\u2019s and \u201840\u2019s, leading up to the beginning of the Second World War. I lived through this historical era which not only intrigues me, but its European setting is of particular interest. Furst\u2019s newest takes place in a lesser known geography where the ethnic tensions, eons old territorial disputes and nationalistic rivalries are always in play. Greece, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, Turkey, Hungary and Romania are the minor, but important characters who provide the prelude for the larger European conflict involving Italy, German, Great Britain and eventually the Soviet Union and the United States. Spies of the Balkans is at its best when establishing the atmosphere and mood of the various players in their run-up to their willing for some, and not so eager for others\u2019 participation in the twentieth century\u2019s worst conflagration. Unfortunately, establishing an authentic setting can\u2019t carry the entire book. There is practically no plot---rather simply, a series of events related to getting Jews out of Berlin and into neutral countries. The protagonist is a Greek police official with a humanitarian conscience who uses all of his considerable military, diplomatic and international law enforcement contacts to thwart Nazi genocidal goals. His efforts are successful, but his successes and the setting are the only things to cheer about in Spies of the Balkans."}, {"userName": "Caroline", "userReviewDate": "Aug 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3858088-caroline", "userReview": "Greece in the early 1940s kept her wary eye on Hitler's advances through parts of Europe. Mussolini, attempting to replicate Hitler's success, decides to invade Greece, but is repelled by the Greek army. But Salonika waits for the inevitable invasion by Hitler's army and secret service.In these uncertain times, spies with different international concerns blend into Salonika society, some catching the eye of Costa Zannis, a police inspector known for his integrity, and one with a special team, working on cases that may require discretion. As the situation for Jews in Germany worsens, he gets involved in an underground movement to rescue Jews fleeing Germany, developing a system with a Jewish wife of a high ranking German officer, and another police official in Zagreb, and helping them escape to Turkey and Egypt. If that wasn't sufficiently stressful, the British secret service seek his assistance in rescuing a British scientist who managed to get himself shot down over occupied France, and bring him back to England. As the situation in Salonika deteriorates, even his own window of opportunity to get his family and lover to leave for safer shores becomes narrower.This is not merely a good spy thriller, it is also an excellent study in characters who believe in doing what's necessary to save humanity, even if it means putting their own lives at risk."}, {"userName": "Jinnie Lee", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7577324-jinnie-lee", "userReview": "# 8 - Meh. There are some things I really enjoyed about this book. Of course, it met my ongoing interest in WWII, and taught me a bit about a location of the war I was not at all familiar with (Greece, Turkey, Hungary, etc. in the Balkans). The writing was pretty good, the scenes were well described, and the plot developments were plausible (which I like even in a fiction book). During the first part of the book, I was pretty excited about the things that were set up, and was eager for the author to deliver on them. Then, once I passed the middle of the book, I realized that nothing about the story was building up the level of excitement I had come to expect! All of the plot lines wrapped up neatly, but there really wasn't any sort of climax to any of them. And that includes the 2 romance story lines for the hero - the first fit in well enough, but the second offered no justification for why the two characters were brought together. Ultimately, both romance stories seemed to have been added solely as an excuse to insert a few sexual scenes into the story (which for some reason, I felt the author did for the benefit of male readers). In conclusion, I will say that I intend to read at least one other book by this author (Spies of Warsaw) just to see if the second time around leads to any additional enthusiasm for this author!"}, {"userName": "Marc", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732885-marc", "userReview": "Spies of the Balkans takes place primarily in Salonika over the six months preceding the April 1941 Nazi invasion of Greece. The protagonist is prototypically Furstian: a highly competent, stoic loner with a strong moral compass. He is Zannis, a police detective who gets involved in an underground network smuggling Jews out of Germany, participates in battles against Italy at the mountainous Albanian border, and gets recruited by British spies to attempt a daring evacuation of an important British scientist from Nazi-occupied Paris. And in between, he does his job (investigating local crimes), ends one love affair, and begins another.The action and plot points are credible, gripping, and flawlessly executed. And they were interesting to me, as they focused on aspects of the Second World War with which I wasn\u2019t very familiar. But as with all of Furst\u2019s novels, the main pleasures are in the atmosphere, the settings, the tone, and the precise and concise way he is able to capture the complex feelings of people whose lives are upended during the onset of WWII. This is one of Furst\u2019s best."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2302318-linda", "userReview": "I've read all of Alan Furst's WWII spy novels and have been entranced by almost all of them.This one is, therefore, a big disappointment. Furst's best books have vivid setting descriptions that create not only the place and times but also the atmosphere and tension of the events. Balkans has so little of this that it could be taking place on an empty sound stage. The best books have a complex characters, people who have been pulled into resistance action by the WWII events that enter their everyday lives but are not action heroes or experts. They are flawed, frightened, and struggling to survive, but compelled to take some action. Balkans main character, Costas Zannis, is flat and uninteresting. Usually in Furst's novels, the plot is intricate and told in great detail. This plot is simple and just when the reader expects a detailed description of a dangerous event, Furst skips it and reports the character safely back at his apartment. All in all, the book seems like an outline, not a fully developed novel. Hopefully, Furst will take more care with his next WWII novel and return to the level of his best work."}, {"userName": "Simon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41670-simon", "userReview": "Another in Furst's series of well-crafted spy novels dealing with World War II. As usual, he takes a relatively unknown (to Americans, that is) corner of the conflict and plunges readers into it. This time it is Salonika during the Graeco/Italo war that climaxed with the Nazi invasion of Yugoslavia and Greece.The protagonist is a Greek policeman named Zannis, and the book is a series of snapshots over the year before the invasion. He becomes involved with a spy ring helmed by the English, as well as a group that smuggles Jews out of Nazi Germany to neutral Turkey.Furst is a terrific writer, and the set-pieces in the book are gripping. If Spies of the Balkans has a fault, it is that it is under-written. He could easily have produced a work twice the length, which would have allowed him to more fully explore the characters, all of which --- with the exception of Zannis --- are more sketchily drawn. And there is a faint sense of \"no surprises here\" about the various resolutions. Unlike many of his other novels, I was not on the edge of my seat once.Those quibbles aside, Spies is a great read."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Dec 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7003440-robin", "userReview": "This was not the first Furst I read. Like so many authors I have come to know, I stumbled over his works when looking for something by someone with a name very close on the library shelves.Furst is adept at drawing out characters who to most people, would not rate a second look. In this case a humble police lieutenant with a chaotic love life living in the back streets of Salonika. It is true to life in that many 'spies' are very ordinary people often chosen because they are expendable or because no-one else would be so stupid as to take on the task. Furst is so versed in the real ways of the intelligence community that one cannot help but wonder is he writes from first-hand experience. Furst is an artist in the sense he portrays characters, warts and all, while simultaneously giving a graphic background, usually grimy or seamy as a backdrop to a first class tale which often moves at break-neck speed. I am sure you will enjoy this book if you enjoy back-street dramas and minor war stories."}, {"userName": "Neil", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10278283-neil", "userReview": "This is book \u211611 in the \"Night Soldiers\" series by Alan Furth. Once again it is set before the start of WWII in the Greek port city of Salonika. The main character is Costa Zannis, a senior Police Officer who discretly covers up various problems of the well connected, he also keeps one ear to the ground to find out what is happening in all levels of life in the city. Everyone is concerned about when the war will come to them. Eventually tiring of Hitler's gains throughout the rest of Europe, Mussolini decides to mount his own campaign, and invade Greece. Shady deals and even shadier characters abound, and there seems to be a spy around every corner.Despite this being a good story, and well told, it will seem rather formulaic for those who have read the other books in the series. The settings quite happen in places often overlooked by the mainstream writers. The characters are just as well written as ever, and there is still the wonderfully conveyed atmosphere.Maybe not the best in the series, but still well worth a read."}, {"userName": "Richard Wise", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2471166-richard-wise", "userReview": "How does he do it? That sense of dark foreboding. Well lots of foreshadowing in the latest from Alan Furst. So many of his characters are fairly ordinary guys shoved into an extraordinary world. A gripping portrait of pre-WWII Europe. This one Costa Zannis, a Greek cop in Salonika who gets involved with a very beautiful, aristocratic German Jewess who is smuggling her friends out of Berlin decides he wants to help. Would he have been so anxious had she looked like the backside of a horse? Probably not but as we find out, Zannis, like most of us, is a sucker for a pretty face.Not overly violent or as exciting as some Furst's, but real earthy characters and action you can believe in. I chose the category of \"literary fiction\" because Furst consistently transcends the historical fiction genre. Having just published such a work I feel myself in a position of authority on the genre."}], "description": "Greece, 1940. Not sunny vacation Greece: northern Greece, Macedonian Greece, Balkan Greece--the city of Salonika. In that ancient port, with its wharves and warehouses, dark lanes and Turkish mansions, brothels and tavernas, a tense political drama is being played out. On the northern border, the Greek army has blocked Mussolini's invasion, pushing his divisions back to Albania--the first defeat suffered by the Nazis, who have conquered most of Europe. But Adolf Hitler cannot tolerate such freedom; the invasion is coming, it's only a matter of time, and the people of Salonika can only watch and wait.At the center of this drama is Costa Zannis, a senior police official, head of an office that handles special \"political\" cases. As war approaches, the spies begin to circle, from the Turkish legation to the German secret service. There's a British travel writer, a Bulgarian undertaker, and more. Costa Zannis must deal with them all. And he is soon in the game, securing an escape route--from Berlin to Salonika, and then to a tenuous safety in Turkey, a route protected by German lawyers, Balkan detectives, and Hungarian gangsters. And hunted by the Gestapo.Meanwhile, as war threatens, the erotic life of the city grows passionate. For Zannis, that means a British expatriate who owns the local ballet academy, a woman from the dark side of Salonika society, and the wife of a local shipping magnate.Declared \"an incomparable expert at his game\" by The New York Times, Alan Furst outdoes even his own finest novels in this thrilling new book. With extraordinary authenticity, a superb cast of characters, and heart-stopping tension as it moves from Salonika to Paris to Berlin and back, Spies of the Balkans is a stunning novel about a man who risks everything to right--in many small ways--the world's evil.", "title": "Spies of the Balkans\n      \n          (Night Soldiers #11)", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7440139.Spies_of_the_Balkans", "average": 3.89, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436807050l/7440139.jpg", "reviews": 549, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/49941.Alan_Furst", "name": "Alan Furst"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Spy Thriller", "Thriller", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7440139-spies-of-the-balkans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18416296-spies-of-the-balkans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10238274-spies-of-the-balkans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9373367-spies-of-the-balkans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8466193-spies-of-the-balkans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8496235-spies-of-the-balkans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/627614.Night_Soldiers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12963396-mission-to-paris", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2294328.The_Spies_of_Warsaw", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/919231.The_World_at_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/435897.Dark_Star"]}
