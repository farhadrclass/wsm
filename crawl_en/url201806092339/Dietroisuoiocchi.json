How does one convey their thoughts on just how addicting, intriguing, and consuming of a book this was, without exposing all the delicious spoilers that make it such a fun read? Behind Her Eyes was the 200th book I\u2019ve read this year, thus completing my Goodreads challenge early, so I guess you could say I\u2019ve read quite a bunch of books in 2016. Out of all those books, this one will stand out for many reasons, but one of the largest would be due to the fact it is quite unlike anything I\u2019ve read thus far in the genre.I can\u2019t rave enough about how compulsive a read this was. I found myself wandering in and out of rooms to avoid people so that I could sneak in \u201cjust a few more pages\u201d. The slow building suspense was gripping and so incredibly well written. Sarah Pinborough has become of my top 10 favorite authors this year and for good reason. Earlier this year I read The Language of Dying and was blown away by her creation of something so beautiful yet disturbing; it absolutely wrecked me. Her talent can\u2019t be confined to one genre; it\u2019s too complex and excellent for that tiny box. She has taken the typical love triangle and made it anything but; there are multiple POVs and storylines intricately woven together to seem unrelated but, come on, we know better. She delicately brings each piece together until the precise moment she wants to drop the #WTFthatending moment. IMO there were really multiple twists that connect into one; the how/why/who was just as important separately as they were in one entity.I read quite a few early reviews on this book, and while some chose to include elements that I view as spoiler material, I almost wish I had seen them prior to reading this book. I believe my expectations would have been altered and I could have accepted this for what it was; an excellent book with a clever, mind-blowing twist that shouldn\u2019t be confined by genre. The best way I know how to explain what I mean is that it doesn\u2019t play by the usual rules of a psychological thriller. If you\u2019ve seen anything yet about this book, you are clearly aware that there is a shocking ending with a whopper of a twist. The catch 22 is that, if this particular element I\u2019m referring to was hinted at via genre description, the surprise aspect of the book is spoiled. The entire ending and twist are dependent on this aspect being kept secret, so you can see the dilemma I\u2019m facing. I take full responsibility for this as it\u2019s a personal problem based on my expectations of something filed in the \u201cpsychological thriller\u201d genre.I can\u2019t really say anything else without taking the fun out of reading this one; suffice it to say this is a must read. I think the most wonderful aspect of this book is that you don\u2019t have to love how the plot works out to love reading the book. Whether you are drawn toward the ending or throw your book across the room, this is a story you must read if you call yourself a fan of any type of thriller. You might even need to read the beginning pages again for full clarity and comparison at just how beautifully Sarah Pinborough has slapped you across the face. This book buried into my brain so deeply that it was in all my waking thoughts and dreams for days; I couldn\u2019t shake it. I\u2019m just going to go ahead and let her take all my money; I\u2019ll read anything she writes compulsively and will be sitting on pins and needles waiting for her next book.Many thanks to Sarah and Flatiron Books for my treasured copy. She worked tirelessly to make sure my arc arrived and I\u2019ll never forget that kindness. I\u2019m paying it forward to Amy at Novelgossip so that we can discuss like ditzy school girls. ;)"}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "[How did she know that Adele dreamed of the \"second door\" just because Adele's sleeping habits were the same as hers?

That ending. That \"WTF-That-Ending\" heard \u2018round the world, or at least, the social media book-reading community. It feels like this author just said, \u201cKnow what? Screw this, I\u2019m doin\u2019 it\u201d, and then she did it. Seriously. She WENT for it.It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve been legitimately shocked as a reader, and I don\u2019t care how much this ending can be reduced down to utter nonsense, I\u2019m embracing the hell out of it and you can\u2019t stop me. Because the fact is, when I swiped those last few virtual pages, my tired eyes narrowed, my offended guts twisted, my face took on a just-sucked-lemon contortion, and my lips curled into a tight little opening that spewed a whispered \nwhat the fuck?\n declaration. And there is was. Sarah Pinborough\u2019s writing is strong, and she paints a picture well without having to tell us the colors she\u2019s using. There were no holes in this plot, no loose ends left untied. Everything made sense, even when it somehow didn\u2019t. The perspectives shifted between characters, and the narratives sometimes switched from first and third person at random. It\u2019s as though this story unveils itself from every angle possible, and yet still it goes and throws me off my feet. I know some readers couldn't get past some of the farfetched scenarios in this one, and I get it. I really do. I'm not one who readily ingests an over-the-top idea if there's not enough conviction behind it. In fact, I typically hate when I'm forced to suspend too much belief for an idea to \"work\". But this story was clever enough to become an exception. I can\u2019t tell you details of the plot because I am your friend and I won\u2019t ruin it for you. But I can tell you this: Soften your critical eye (if possible) when going into this one, so you can just enjoy the journey.

It is well written enough to keep the reader engaged. The three main characters of Louise, David and Adele are unlikeable. Louise finds herself involved with David who turns out to be her new boss. She runs into his wife, Adele, and a cloying, claustrophobic, but close and secretive relationship develops between them. Since her divorce, Louise has had a stagnant and isolated personal life, and she needs the attention she has begun to receive. David is the first man she has a sexual affair with since her husband. Despite the guilt she feels, she gets drawn to and more closely entwined with Adele. A sinister and toxic image of Adele and David's marriage emerges. Louise has night terrors which Adele wants to help her with. She gives the mysterious notebook of the elusive Rob to guide her to counter those terrors. In a tale that takes in cats, fires and constant relocations of David and Adele, Louise may find that she has bitten off more than she can chew as she enters the uncharted waters of David and Adele's marriage. I am aware that many really love this novel, unfortunately I am not one of them. For me, the story developed does not segue well into the twists that unfold at the end. The dissonance I experienced between the rabbits pulled out of the hat at the close of the novel, felt like the author had arrived at calculated intellectual solutions which fail to match the revealed storyline. The character of David feels underdeveloped, and I did not have sufficient reasons to believe in his and Louise's relationship. However, I am sure the majority of readers will like this book. Many thanks to HarperCollins for an ARC."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "2.5 StarsIf I had known then what I know now I may not even have bothered reading this Novel as I felt it strayed from psychological thriller to Fantasy/Paranormal which didn't work for me. I have a hard time suspending disbelief at the best of times in books and therefore stay away from novels where fantasy or magic realism play a role but I do like a good well written Psychological thriller and have read a couple this year that I really enjoyed. While Behind Her Eyes is unique and well written and there is no doubt the author holds your attention throughout but I did find a find myself having to seriously suspend disbelief and there was a lot of eye rolling not to mention a couple of choice words mouthed close to the end of the book for reasons that are best left unsaid.I would probably have rated the book 4 stars for suspenseful and original plot, great character development but what a let down the belief element was. I know I am in the minority on this one and so many readers have loved it but this is just my reaction to the book.I listened to this one on audio and the narration was excellent.An enjoyable read just not one for my favourites list."}, {"userName": "Larry H", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5872506-larry-h", "userReview": "Umm, seriously? What did I just read?Sarah Pinborough's new book, \nBehind Her Eyes\n is one crazy book, one that at different times had me totally hooked, rolling my eyes, predicting (incorrectly) how the plot would be tied together, and then, ultimately, re-reading the last few chapters a few times to make sure what I thought happened actually did.So, let's see how to review this. \"Secrets, secrets, secrets. People are filled to the brim with them if you look closely.\"Louise is a single mother to a young son. She works part-time as a secretary at a psychiatry office, and for the most part, spends her evenings caring for her son and drinking a little too much wine, and at times suffers from night terrors she can't explain. She'd love to meet a new man but doesn't really want to make the effort.Then she meets him. Smart, funny, handsome, seems completely interested in her. They spend a somewhat drunken evening in a bar, and clearly there's chemistry between the two of them. After a passionate kiss, he flees, but she feels heartened that finally, someone special took an interest in her. Then on Monday, Louise discovers that this man is David, her new boss. Oh, and he's married, to a beautiful, elegant woman. Bollocks. Louise bravely tries to soldier on despite her disappointment and David's occasionally flirtatious nature, but she is determined not to be one of those women. One day, while walking near her office, she (literally) runs into Adele, a beautiful, lonely woman clearly in need of a friend. And then, Louise quickly realizes Adele is David's wife. Adele starts to encourage Louise on ways to improve herself\u2014cut back on the wine, quit smoking, join a gym.When David's interest in Louise starts to intensify, she doesn't know what to do. She definitely has feelings for David, but she likes having Adele as a friend, even under the circumstances. She knows the secrets she's keeping from each of them are wrong, but she can't break up with either of them. And it appears both of them need her, in their own ways, as much as she needs them.If you think you know what's going to happen from here, you're probably right\u2014and you're utterly wrong. Pinborough combines elements of your typical love triangle and the story of the marriage that no one understands with some seriously bizarre, suspend-your-disbelief plot elements. When it works, the book practically hums with finesse and intrigue, and when it doesn't work, it's one of two things\u2014you just can't wrap your head around what is allegedly happening, or you feel the book has fallen into such stereotypical territory it annoys you.Ultimately, why this book worked for me (despite having to suspend my disbelief) is Pinborough's storytelling. These aren't likable characters, the plot jumps back and forth between narrators and time periods, and sometimes you wonder how the characters know what's going on. But Pinborough's writing mesmerized me, and the originality she demonstrates helps the positive outweigh the negative.This will not be a book for everyone. But if you want to go on a crazy ride with some crazy characters, pick this one up. Because when a book comes with a hashtag, \n#wtfthatending\n, you know you need to give it a try.See all of my reviews at http://itseithersadnessoreuphoria.blo...."}, {"userName": "Kaceey - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13442817-kaceey---traveling-sister", "userReview": "Get ready for a wild ride!

Having read Mayhem and The Language of Dying, Behind Her Eyes ventures into a deep psychological pond. The fish swimming there seem to glide against the tide of reality. You really wouldn't want to go wading into that pool of murky water on your own.Louise, a single mom and a part-time employed secretary, dips her toes into that pond one night. She shares a passionate kiss with a man at a crowded bar. That kiss still lingers as she comes to find out the next day that he is her new boss, David, the latest psychiatrist in her office. That kiss should also have come with a High Voltage warning. David and Louise can't get enough of one another and so it begins......And in walks Adele, David's beautiful wife. Strangely, Louise and Adele become friends and even share outings to a gym together. Let the games begin. David knows nothing of this bonding by the women. And Adele seems to know nothing about these two enamored fish. Oh, and Louise? She's certainly not saying much these days. This is a real cat and mouse tale told through chapters entitled \"Then\" and the shift back into the present. None of these characters are likeable for a multitude of reasons that will be revealed. But you find yourself unable to look away. Which one is more unstable than the other?Sarah Pinborough presents a story that is driven on a curvy road by these characters. I kept looking in the rearview mirror to see if I should have gotten off at the last exit. The last chapters will either hang your mouth open in shock or will tap on the brillance beacon. Sideline anything you've read before. This one dabbles in strange, very strange waters. So consider all things before taking this one on. The water's fine for some, but not for all."}, {"userName": "Maureen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13427823-maureen", "userReview": "Who's a clever girl then?

That was one of the best endings I can remember in awhile.\nI almost gave this sucker five stars..but at times it does get overly talky and it has some plot holes bigger than my butt.

A little too much for me, too twisty, too much back and forth. Who is telling the truth? Nothing ever certain, even if you think you know.

What did I just read? I haven't the faintest idea! Crazy with a side of Tabasco thrown in? Something like that.And now for my review? I don't even know what to say. First, this book is bat-sh&t cray cray. Second, you must believe the hype people, it's real. So what\u2019s the story? Louise, a single mother, is out one night having a drink \u2013 there she meets a man (David), whom she is immediately drawn to. The night is mostly innocent, though there is an instant connection. You know how it is. The next day Louise goes into the medical office where she works as a secretary and discovers that David is her new boss. And he\u2019s married. Talk about uncomfortable. Later, while out and about, Louise meets his wife, Adele, and finds that Adele is absolutely amazing. Over time the two somehow become besties, all the while Louise carries on an affair with David and Louise just can\u2019t choose between the two. AS IF. Thereafter, things become a little strange (RIGHT?!) and Louise gets drawn deeper and deeper into David and Adele\u2019s crazy as heck marriage. As you might be able to tell, this is one crazy, compelling and totally compulsive read. I admit that towards the end, I snuck in time to read this whenever I could (at times when I should have been well, say - doing more productive things). Sarah Pinborough\u2019s writing is suspenseful, gripping and full of life. Her writing can\u2019t be confined, nor can it be perfectly presented in a pretty little package. It\u2019s crazy, wild and totally out there. The characters are all consuming, I got so wrapped up in them - especially the character of Adele, that I felt like I couldn\u2019t escape. And perhaps that was the point. At the end, my eyes flew open, I re-read the last few pages several times and thought I might have gone nuts, but alas, I\u2019m only a little crazy (I think). It might have been one of the craziest, strangest endings I have ever read. But I think you all know that by now. You\u2019ve read enough reviews. It is a WT-Frak ending. Nothing you have read will prepare you for it. And if you think for a second that you are going to figure this out, I just have one thing to say: You\u2019re never going to get it - so just quit while you're ahead! Then again.. my GR \u201csister\u201d Norma apparently figured it out (based on her splendid review), so maybe, just maybe you will actually be able to figure it out after all. Regardless, it is one insane ride and is well worth it. Recommended for anyone looking to be entertained.

Thank you Flatiron Books! I appreciate the hard work that you do to promote authors and new books. Having said that, I am always a bit leery of books that are sent out to the social media world with such grandiosity and heavy-handed publicity. Can't a great book get footing on its own? Sadly, maybe not. Oh well, never mind that thought. I am somewhat of a realist, but I'm open-minded and curious about subjects like lucid dreaming, mainly for the psychological aspects that may pertain to a murder mystery. You are led as a reader to think this book is traveling the byways of memories, dreams, affairs and murders. The pages fly fast and I was so involved in this story - until the abrupt end. The publishers strongly encouraged all the ARC readers to discuss the book with the hypey #WTFthatending. Well, I guess that is an appropriate hashtag, but it goes either way. I detest the ending. Such a cheap gimmick. It's like having your mouth all set for a T-bone steak and it morphs right on the grill into a shape-shifting slice of frozen pizza. I know there are thousands of reviews out there on this book and my opinion appears to be in the minority. Not gonna lie, the ending of the story was like a sucker punch to the gut and I actually got angry. I tossed the book on the floor and didn't even bother writing a review for it. I felt used and abused as a reader.I live for plot twists. I love when authors write from different points of view. Heck, I want SHE LOVED PLOT TWISTS written on my tombstone. Not only that, but BEHIND HER EYES has a couple of unreliable narrators- my absolute favorite literary device! How could all these elements be in this one book, yet go so wrong?The ending of this book is more of a deus ex machina than anything else. Deus ex machina is a Latin term meaning \"god out of the machine.\" It refers to an unexpected, artificial or improbable character, device or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction to resolve a situation or untangle a plot. It is disappointing to me that a writer of Sarah Pinborough's caliber would end such a great story with a cheap plot device. There is barely a hint of where the book is going until the last few pages and then ridiculously, hideously its over. CRAZY TOWN!!"}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra", "userReview": "This is how you write a psychological thriller!!!!! Holy Hell! I DID NOT SEE that ending coming. Please, Please, Please, READ this book but do not read ahead!!!! Do not peek (or scroll) to those last remaining pages, Don't spoil it for yourself. I LOVE when a book can take me by surprise. I read A LOT and when a book can pull off a Mind Fuck like that - I love it!!!! First off, this book grabbed me from page one and did not let go and by then end I was excited - not sure if this is correct. I was elated that this book totally blew me away.Louise is a single Mom who does not have much excitement in her life. I wanted to whisper in her ear for her to strap herself in because things are going to get real interesting real quick. She goes to a bar one night and meets an interesting man, David. It is not like her to flirt but they hit things off instantly and they shared a passionate kiss. Finally she has meet someone! Her excitement is dashed when her new boss starts work the next morning and she quickly learns that her new MARRIED boss is David, the man from the bar with whom she felt an instant connection. Embarrassed they both acknowledge what happened between them and agree to have a professional working relationship. But then, Lousie runs into (literally and physically) David's elegant and beautiful,wife, Adele. To make things even more complicated she also feels a connection to Adele. Adele and Louise become friends. It appears that both women have sleep issues and helps cement their bond. Louise really enjoys their friendship. Adele seems to really enjoy Lousie's friendship. Talk about being torn, Louise can't keep her eyes and her hands off David. David can't keep his hands off Louise. David and Adele clearly have a strained and toxic relationship. David, who seems so warm and loving to Louise, is controlling and hostile to Adele. Adele seems fragile and afraid of David.As Lousie attempts to have a relationship with both - without the other's knowledge - it becomes obvious that not everything is as it seems. Who is telling the truth? Something is very, very wrong in David's and Adele's marriage. What will happen when the \"truth\" comes out?I thought I knew what was happening and how the book was going to end. Boy, oh boy was I shocked. Not everything or everyone is as they seem. Just when I felt I know what was happening, the Author picked up the plot and shook it up a couple of times. There are parts where the reader needs to suspend disbelief. Things get a little out-there in a metaphysical sci-fi way. But DO NOT let that stop you. I would not have picked up this book if not for a book club challenge (thank you KUYH). I LOVED this book. It was my first book by this Author and it will NOT be my last. I HIGHLY recommend this book! Books like this one are why I love reading so MUCH! The suspense was spot on. This was a delightfully dark page turner for me.

The reviews for this book were amazing for the most part, so I was eagerly awaiting my copy from the library. In the meantime, I got acquainted with the author by reading \u201cMayhem\u201d, which was pretty good, and made me even more excited about delving into this one. The book gets off to a sinister start because Adele and David are obviously having a hard time in their marriage. David appears to be the classic abusive control freak, while Adele is the docile, reclusive, stay at home wife. Enter, Louise, David\u2019s new secretary and suddenly a highly unusual triangle develops between the three of them. Louise suffers from night terrors and Adele helps her find a way to control them as their friendship continues to develop, despite the fact that Louise and David are carrying on together. As Louise gets more involved with the couple, she begins to understand there is something very wrong going on and finds herself caught in their web. If you have read any other reviews of this book, you will have no doubt heard about the surprise, \u2018what just happened\u2019 ending. While the majority of people have praised the conclusion,and I admit it was a total shock, I was mostly irritated by it, although as crazy as it was, it was also pretty chilling.  The buildup of suspense was very effectual, and the characters were well drawn for the most part. I was fully engaged in the story, which is certainly a mind trip, even before the ultimate shock ending, but I have to say that instead of feeling wowed, I was underwhelmed by the sucker punch twist. Still, I have to give the author kudos for pulling it off without a hitch, and I do \u2018get\u2019 why some people were impressed by it and why they have been raving about this book. The writing is stellar, but while I would love to say I really enjoyed this one, sadly I did not.

However, in the case of Sarah Pinborough's latest, Behind Her Eyes, the hype is justified.The story is told by Louise and Adele, two women who meet after Adele's husband, David, takes a new job at a doctor's office where Louise works. Louise is a single mum, newly divorced and a bit down, and she is quick to form a deep tie with Adele. Yet, she also quickly notices something is quite odd in Adele and David's marriage.There is so much I want to say about this book, but I won't because too much information would just spoil it, even though that ending is so unpredictable!There is an element of the supernatural in this story, which can really backfire, but in this case, it reminded me of Rosamund Lupton's, Afterwards, where it worked perfectly to built the eerie atmosphere and deliver a shocking ending. I had guessed a part of it, but the final twist was totally twisted and unexpected, but when I went back a little, the clues were sort of there, which makes this book all the more inventive and clever.This story was definitely an original, smart page turner, and I can't wait to see what the author comes up with next!I was thrilled to receive and ARC of this book by Flatiron Books in exchange for an honest review.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"}, {"userName": "Melisa - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42481357-melisa---traveling-sister", "userReview": "I don't even know what just happened. #wtfthatending is right.
