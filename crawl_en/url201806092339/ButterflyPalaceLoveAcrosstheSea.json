Colleen CobleReview from Jeannie Zelos Book reviews.I enjoy historical romances, and the title of this intrigued me. Sadly though it just didn't live up to my expectations. I found the characters very confusing, acting in ways that people of that time and station would not have been allowed. The plots were all linked but seemed very simplistic. There was so much going on in such a small village it was hard to believe in, a serial murderer, currency counterfeiting, political assassination, secret tunnels \u2013 although its quite a decent length novel there was so much happening that I felt it was \u201cbusy\u201d but without any depth. I need to feel that the story could be real and here it didn't. There were plot contradictions too \u2013 first Drew doesn't know Lily's mother is dead, then a couple of chapters later he says his cousin (Grace \u2013 may have been his sister?) wrote to him often, and he knew about the death shortly after it happened. ** edit 26 june 16. another reader has pointed out I may have got this wrong, that he may have got a letter soon after Lily got there. Its too long since I read it and I just can't remember now but if I'm wrong, then apologies. When I've time I will go back and check this** Then the reason for his actions ( and would someone get into place just like that, without years of training etc?) seemed to get pushed aside for a different motive. It was all change from plots and actions, to people's motives and inclinations, and it just didn't gel with me. The butterfly connection which I\u2019d assumed was of great importance from the title, was really almost superfluous.I can see that Colleen is a much loved author, and there are many favourable reviews for this book \u2013 that just shows what I\u2019m always trying to point out, that not all books work for all readers, and reviews are very personal according to a readers own taste in novels. It's priced at \u00a35.87 for 332 pagesStars: two \u2013 just didn't work for me.

It took me a couple tries to get into this book. As I told one of my Goodreads friends the first time I tried reading it: \"Since Colleen Coble is one of my favorite authors, I've gotten to where I don't even read the book blurbs for her books anymore. So I had absolutely no idea what this book was about when I started reading it. And I didn't realize it was historical fiction... I think I'll enjoy it, but I've put it on hold for now because I'm just not in the mood to read historical books right now.\"But then I was looking through the audiobooks that my library has to offer, trying to find books to listen to at work, and I found this one. So I decided to give it another try. And I'm glad that I did, because I really enjoyed it!This review isn't what it could have been since the book isn't fresh in my mind-- because I read it over a month ago and just haven't had the time to write a review until just now-- but I'll do my best.Honestly, I give this book 3.5 stars because I really enjoyed the mystery and suspense of the story. I couldn't rate it higher than that because it just wasn't quite that good and I kinda felt like there was too much focus on the former relationship between the hero & heroine. I mean, I did think that was pretty well written, but... perhaps shouldn't have been dwelt on quite so much?I remember reading one review (I can't recall which it was & I don't have time to go re-read them all to find out) that complained that not enough attention was payed to the town where the story takes place and that was causing some confusion for some readers. Perhaps that's true, but I really couldn't say for sure because I'm relatively familiar with Austin, Texas (having lived in Oklahoma my whole life & having visited TX on innumerable occasions) so I didn't end up with any odd ideas about that area, such as the size of Austin or anything like that. So I guess if you know anything about that area and you're like me, you might not notice anything odd. But perhaps the author should have included more information for those readers who aren't familiar with that area?As I said before, I did enjoy the mystery and suspense. Even though upon first \"meeting\" the serial killer, I did almost instantly figure out who it was, the suspense was still there and there were other mystery elements to the story to be figured out. ;)I liked seeing Lilly and Drew grow and develop throughout the story. And there were other characters who I also really liked a lot. I especially liked the character of Belle. At the beginning, she annoyed me and was kinda driving me crazy, but by the end of the book I liked her quite a bit. She had potential to have a story of her own... I'll admit I was pretty disappointed (mostly sad) for the way things turned out for one particular character, though. :'(Well... that's all I've got time for. I regret that I also don't have time to share links to my friends' reviews or any favorite quotes on the blog post that's scheduled to publish on July 19th... I really wish I could. :/"}, {"userName": "Kathylill ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2604354-kathylill", "userReview": "DNFed around 20% I am not much of a mystery fan and this one is just not for me. Lilly is a typical small-town Mary Sue \"It's not my fault everybody likes me / promotes me.\" Not even a day since her arrival and everybody in that household commented on her adorable looks, her blond long hair and of course she is instantly promoted from kitchen servant to maid servant (hairdresser and dress-councelor) *Eye-roll* Since I haven't come close to finishing it I can't say if the mystery is good or not. I know who the killer is though (hahaha won't tell!). But the rest of the book reads like a very bad Nora Roberts and even her books are average at best."}, {"userName": "Whitney", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3852854-whitney", "userReview": "I keep telling myself that life is too short to read bad writing. But since I write a lot of bad writing, myself, it's all a moot point, yo.I downloaded Butterfly Palace via Overdrive from my public library system. So my local tax dollars have already paid for this. Okay, not dollars. More like bits and pieces of pocket change, lint included. American public libraries are criminally underfunded.But anyway, I am severely unimpressed by this example of Colleen Coble's writing. The woman has written dozens of books. I think they're mostly romances about Texas. And they're kind of religious romances.Take our heroine in this book for example. She has a fianc\u00e9 named Dudley or whatever, and they are very much in love (she has already \"given herself\" to him\u2014gasp! And in a bed! The book never shows this.) What readers DO see is the result of their dalliance\u2014a house burns down and their fathers both die. Dudley mutters \"Don't look at me. I can't even stand myself,\" and he disappears for four years. Oops, his name isn't Dudley, but who the hell cares. I say it's his name now.Our heroine is named Lily, and since her family is dead and her fianc\u00e9 is missing, she has to fend for herself in a life of servitude. She spends some time in the book wondering about \"God,\" and whether certain things were forgiven or whatever. (Good news. Even though God never shows up and states his opinion or demonination, apparently he loves everyone except psychopaths.)I got so sick of all the lazy writing in this book. We get dozens of instances of characters \"curling their fingers into their palms,\" and \"colliding gazes\" with each other. This is flat-out bad writing.But here's the fun part. Sometimes the writing was so bad, I laughed outloud! Author seemed to struggle with verbs. Like, to keep things interesting, she wanted to \"show\" how the hero Dudley was doing secret spy work. (Oh, Not a spoiler: he comes back and helps Lily with solving a mystery or whatever. He has been involved in secret spy work.) The book describes him as \"turning on his heels and melting into a crowd.\" God, is this man a CARTOON? How is turning on one's heels and MELTING supposed to indicate subtle behavior? Same goes for Lily. One time she \"wheels and stalks toward the door.\" Those two goobers are just going all over the place!Next Example of Laughter. Two manly characters are discussing conspiracies (shhh, secret spy stuff.) Dudley observes about a clue, \"It feels like it's the tip of something larger.\" THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID! I literally typed this note in my ebook. Another time, I typed OH SHUT UP, after someone else curled their fingers or melted for the millionth time.Also: ANACHRONISMS! Dudley talks about needing to be \"under the radar\" 50 years before Radar is invented. Is he a time traveler now? And someone else zips shut a bag. Zippers aren't invented yet, fools! I actually looked this up, because I was angry about how this mess got published.And oh my god! We have one of our villains asking \"How do I know you won't mess up the assassination?\" Gee Wally! I sure do hope you're not sore about the whole assassination business. Thanks for the fun, chumps, but I'm out of here. I can't handle it anymore."}, {"userName": "Lynda Edwards", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18492152-lynda-edwards", "userReview": "Having read Coble's historical novels before, I have had my eye on this more recent release for a while now. I was not disappointed in this novel, which is very tense even from the opening pages. A fire, a murderer, people living under assumed identities, and a slightly creepy house all combine to give a gothic feel to this novel. As with many historicals, this novel served to de-romanticize some of my notions about the time period. Although the glamor of the wealthy is pleasant, it is shown to be a thin veneer. Underneath the shine, women have very little say in their own futures, and those who are in service have even less. One of the more interesting aspects of the history has to do with law enforcement and several different branches get at least some treatment in these pages. I found the details about police, Pinkerton, and Secret Service agents helped set the story and its resolution up nicely. The Christian perspective of this novel is delivered by flawed characters who have made sinful choices in the past but who are living life in a more Godly manner now. They still struggle with their flesh but choose a better path with strength gained along the journey. Respecting women through boundaries is shown to be a positive thing and helping others in need when it does not benefit the giver is demonstrated often through the main characters. Because some of the circumstances in this book are a bit more mature and several of the scenes disturbing, I recommend this novel for adults. Those who enjoy suspense will likely have no problem with the violence level, but those sensitive to acts against women may especially find several portions disturbing. I borrowed this book from the library and have no motivation behind this review other than to share my thoughts with other readers."}, {"userName": "Shauna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15398552-shauna", "userReview": "The setting for this book is the very interesting Butterfly Palace, an old palace brought over from Europe and reconstructed in Austin, Texas. It's full if secret passage ways, mystery ... and dead butterflies. The wealthy master of the house, Mr. Everett Marshall, collects rate butterfly specimens. Thus the name of the book.That being said, unfortunately the book is not worthy of it's rather exotic setting. The writing is stilted and the story down right unbelievable. If you're in the secret service you sure don't go around telling people. If you were a brand new lady's maid you best keep your opinions to yourself - and not go running off in the middle of the day - or you would be fired for sure. There is just too much in this story that doesn't add up. I really didn't like the fact that Drew and Lily had such an intimate past but it never seems like a very big deal. That was almost excused by the fact that they had been engaged. It was all very cheesy and so disappointing from an author I had come to respect.This book was provided to me by Thomas Nelson.

But other than her few books, I'm fairly unfamiliar with the genre. I enjoyed this book because it had the Christian aspect, the romance aspect, and a lot of mystery to it as well. The religious aspect to this novel was fairly minimal, but I would also say it was important to the storyline. It was very subtle, but I actually wish there was more because that was what I was expecting in a \"Christian Fiction\" novel. There were a lot of discussions about why these terrible events keep happening to good people and I loved that the moral was that it makes us all stronger. I particularly liked a scene where Lily talks about how much stronger she has become because of her trials, that she wasn't the same person she was when her Drew were engaged, but she also says that she wouldn't want to go through any more of these struggles! LOLThere were a few storylines that I found a little far-fetched, like Drew being a part of the Secret Service. But once I got passed that piece of information, I really enjoyed this book. I liked trying to figure out who was after Mr. Marshall, who started the fire that killed Lily and Drew's Dads, and who was killing the women. It may have been a little too much with too few pages? While I still enjoyed the book, the mysteries were very surface level, and I wanted more information as to what was happening. I was very intrigued by the man killing women, and I wanted more of that storyline, and maybe less about the fire. But overall, the storylines all came together at the end, but it may have been a little haphazardly done. The butterflies throughout the book were really creepy, I could just imagine this vault with thousands of butterflies covering every inch. Then there was the scene where the (live) butterflies were migrating because the of the humidity/weather, and then Lily was swarmed by them. Terrifying. But I kind of loved it in a weird way, it was definitely one of these weird character quirks that Mr. Marshall had. I slightly did not get the closure I was hoping for with this one, there really wasn't an explanation for the killer's motive, and that's just to name one (I don't want to spoil anything). So that was a little disappointing, but I would definitely read another of Coble's novels. There's a lot of great characters, and there really wasn't anyone I disliked.

Filled with lots of mystery and suspense along with a light dose of romance, this Downton Abbey-like novel is sure to delight and impress, keeping you up late into the night!This is the third novel I've read by Colleen Coble, and for sure my favorite of the three. (The first two were Tidewater Inn and Rosemary Cottage). I was completely blown away with this novel, since the other books I'd read by her weren't as good as this novel, in my opinion, and I absolutely loved every singe page of this novel! I remember just finishing the first chapter and thinking to myself that I already knew that without a doubt I'd have this book on my favorites list. In fact, I loved it so much, I'm putting it on my top three favorite reads of 2014! If you enjoy historical fiction set in the 1900's, placed in an elaborate Texas mansion, complete with the inside look at the everyday life of the servants who keep the house functioning (this book reminded me a lot of the beloved T.V. series Downton Abbey); mixed with a health dose of mystery and edge-of-your-seat suspense, then you absolutely must read this novel! I just loved this setting! I mean being a proud Texan, I was already excited how the book is set in Austin Texas, and to find that it was set in a huge mansion that reminded me a lot of Downton Abbey, then I knew I'd enjoy it. This novel was everything I was hoping for based on reading the synopsis, and then some! The suspense in this novel really surprised me. I knew Colleen mainly wrote suspense novels, but this one was a masterpiece! I loved how she combined the time period and setting with the mystery, and found it to be a very interesting suspense, filled with lots of historical details. Another thing I noticed was how well thought out the plot was. There were constant twists and turns in the story that left me on the edge of my seat and re-evaluation who I assumed was behind the dangerous undercover work. It was obvious with how smoothly the story flowed that the author thought out the plot very well, and it definitely showed! While I do highly recommend this book to historical suspense fans, I will say that due to some mature content, I would only recommend this book to mature readers. Mature content included a scene where a couples' kissing lead went too far and resulted in an alluded love scene whilst in a barn alone. While not many details were given of the event, the idea that they were involved in an inappropriate love scene was obviously alluded to, though not obviously stated. I felt like the romance scenes were a little overly mushy, and ended up skipping most of the kissing scenes as there was a bit more passion than I cared to read. There were also several scenes involving a murderer, and while again not many details were given, there were a few details on how the victim's necks were slit, as well as a scene were a body was found. While the author did handle these scenes without giving overly gory details, younger readers will still want to take caution when reading.D I S C L A I M E R :: I received a free copy of Butterfly Palace from the publisher for the purpose of this review.

The book description says:Elegance and wealth. Privilege and politics. The extravagance of the Butterfly Palace overwhelmed Lily\u2019s senses and nearly smothered her painful memories. She pushed away her misgivings . . . She was perfectly safe in this huge house.Austin, Texas\u20141904: Abandoned by the love of her life and still mourning the loss of her mother, Lily Donaldson has turned her back on the pain and come to Austin for a fresh start, working for the Marshall family as a kitchen maid in their luxurious mansion, the Butterfly Palace. The tasks before her are legion, and her mistress less than pleasant, but at least Lily\u2019s new life will be, if nothing else, distracting.But one night, while serving at a dinner party, Lily recognizes the man who abandoned her, Andy, her liaison from the livery stable, the blacksmith\u2019s son . . . sitting among the distinguished guests. Though he recognizes her, Andy does not acknowledge her aloud, and Lily is left reeling, flabbergasted, and irate.But before she can get an explanation, the path of the Servant Girl Killer swerves very close to the Butterfly Palace, sowing terror among the maids. Having come to Austin to start anew, Lily suddenly feels trapped in a spider web. How can she know who to trust in a house where lies come dressed in fine suits and deceit in silk gowns the colors of butterfly wings?Sometimes along the way life can get really interesting and really complicated. I think we have all experienced a little bit of Lily's feelings of constant struggle with no time to just rest and be at piece. Lily is a girl who has fallen on some very rough times, and when she thinks things are about to pick up and get better for her, she realizes she is wrong. First she runs into her former love, who ran off on her without a word, but then there is a servant girl killer on the loose, and she just got hired on as a new servant girl.Lily finds herself being blamed for every good or bad thing that goes on around her. She starts to question why God is letting all these happen to her. I think its something we can all relate to.One of the reasons I like Colleen Coble's books is that even when you think you have it all figured out as to what will happen, there is a twist you weren't ready for. Butterfly Palace is a great book with tons of mystery and intrigue. Whenever I thought I had it figured out I was lead down a different path.I recommend this book, especially if you are a fan of Colleen Coble's. I found this book to be a pretty quick read.

It is a bit creepy but that adds to book\u2019s tension. Colleen Coble writes well and kept me wondering throughout and wanting to read more. I didn\u2019t want to put the book down. In addition to being a mystery, Butterfly Palace is an historical fiction set in Austin, Texas in 1904. One definitely gets a sense of how the haves and have nots lived during this period. Well to do families lived in large houses and hired working members of working families as personal maids, seamstresses, stable staff and drivers and as house staff for cooking, cleaning, serving etc. Effectively those with wealth had their every need taken care of by someone else.The Butterfly Palace mystery involves a serial killer, a counterfeit ring and political chicanery. It is also a story about coming of age, making new friends and romance gone amuck \u2013 all intertwined to make for a very interesting and enjoyable read. I think having so much to read about - interesting bits of history, love, jealousy, tension, fear, killings, privilege, poverty, cruelty, selfishness and passion; is what makes Butterfly Palace so successful. Coble\u2019s writing style is a major contributing factor. She is a masterful story teller and writes at a great pace that carried me along throughout. Her plot development is excellent and she does also a good job of character development. There are quite a number of characters in the book; all with unique and well-described attributes \u2013 described so well that you can\u2019t help but become engrossed in their lives and really come to like some and quite dislike others.Coble is popular and well followed by Christian fiction fans. To simply categorize Butterfly Palace in this genre would do the book a disservice. Yes, there is a subtle message that comes through in the story \u2013 a message about being unable to control everything in one\u2019s life and thereby encouraging the characters (and the readers) to let go and trust. It\u2019s a great message for believers and non-believers alike. First and foremost, I would say this is a terrific mystery and in Butterfly Palace Colleen Coble demonstrates that she is a masterful story teller worth reading."}, {"userName": "Ibjoy1953 Hannabass", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5101390-ibjoy1953-hannabass", "userReview": "My ReviewI wasn\u2019t sure what to expect from this book.

For secular fiction, I'd have praised the moral points, of how a hero and heroine attempt to leave behind their former sinful relations with each other; for Christian fiction, I really didn't like scenes where the hero goes from reading his Bible one minute and trying very hard not to lust for the heroine the next. This would have worked a lot better for me if it had been Fiction rather than Christian fiction. Really, there's no reason it shouldn't be, other than who it's published by. The religion is no more than is to be expected from the culture of the day.The plot was worthy of a much more epic book. There's tons of intricacy to what goes on, but the city itself is rather shadowy. Other than a few references to \"big city\", \"unaccustomed noise\", etc, there wasn't much attention paid to the scene of town. So much so that other reviewers, unfamiliar with the history of Texas and Austin, have come to the rather humorous idea that the story takes place in a \"small village\". I think Coble took for granted that most of her readers might have had a high-school-level Texas history course. News: they didn't.The characters themselves got most of the attention. This definitely is in the category of romantic suspense. I liked how characters related to each other and grew throughout the story. However, I'd have marked it higher under other circumstances. The plot idea had the potential to be a new favorite. You can't drive a story with character and action alone, especially a historical story, and expect readers to feel anything more than a mansion in a city of unformed mist.I did guess the serial killer when I \"met\" him! ;)"}, {"userName": "Joanie Bruce", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12027480-joanie-bruce", "userReview": "The title of this book sounded intriguing and caused me to purchase the book; however, I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would. Although I finished the book, I struggled to keep reading until the mystery was solved. I know Colleen Coble is a great author with many fans, but this one was not one of my favorites.What I liked: The beginning started with a bit of intrigue and mystery. The character Lily, has gone from living in wealth to working as a servant. When she meets her ex-fiance who is introduced by another name, the mystery begins. From that point on, the book includes mystery, suspense, and secrets. The suspense sections were written well, and kept you turning pages. The book was good at portraying the snobby feelings and actions of the \u201cupper-crust\u201d toward the servants ... those who made their employer's lives pleasant.What I didn\u2019t like: The story seemed to drag on too long, and I found myself skimming the boring or repetitive sections. The attraction that Lily and Drew felt for each other seemed to be merely physical. I missed the true loving, emotional connection between these two main characters. I could not get into this book as well as I would have liked. The beginning was interesting and keep me reading, anticipating more of the same.

It was mostly the romance between Lilly and Drew; it is stated that in their past they did not keep their relationship pure, and although by the time they meet again both of them regret their past mistakes, there's still an awful lot of kissing involved. (The uncomfortable, mushy kind) I didn't find it difficult to skip those parts, and there was certainly more to the story than that. But still, it was a disappointment.One of my favorite aspects of the book was Lilly's mistress, Belle, who starts out as an incredibly dislikable character...until later in the book when she begins to change. Normally characters like that don't change and are just the one-dimensional, spoiled and annoying rich girls who exist only to make life harder for the heroine, and though Belle started out that way, by the end of the book she was one of my favorite characters because she was interesting. In the end, though I wasn't amazed with this book, and found some of the content that continued to pop up rather annoying, I do give it points for having a detailed mystery and few intriguing characters.I received this book for free from booksneeze.com in exchange for my honest review."}, {"userName": "Kim McGee", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5057126-kim-mcgee", "userReview": "I admit that I wanted to read this book because I live in an old house in Austin and have always been fascinated with the serial murders that took place here back in the late 1800s.

I had the \"bad guys\" figured out halfway through the book.This is not a \"Christian\" fiction book as there is really nothing that speaks to Christianity except a few allusions to praying. Nothing speaks of the heart. It seems like the new requirements for Christian fiction is the obligatory 4 pages of sex as in secular books. I'm not quite sure why this trend is, but this author got hers in."}, {"userName": "Michelle Bachelor", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20866168-michelle-bachelor", "userReview": "This was a light enjoyable read if you set aside a desire for character development and plausability.

I own several of her books, and have read even more than I own (shout out to the library!). She has such a unique writing style, and her novels are not like your every day time-passer. I get so into her books that I completely forget everything that is going on around me and I become agitated with anyone who dares pull me from my reading world. Whenever I get a new Coble title in my hands my family knows to leave me alone or deal with the consequences. I recently recommended Colleen Coble to a friend and she told me earlier this week that she was hooked! She went out and bought another one of her novels! All this to say, I went into this book with high expectations, because I know exactly what the author is capable of. And I wasn't disappointed due to my assumptions. Colleen Coble has outdone herself yet again. I don't know how someone can write a Christian murder mystery and make it blend together well like those two naturally belong together, but somehow she did. It wasn't gory or scary (I would be the first one to say so if it was, I'm pretty easily freaked out), but it did have the suspense that any murder mystery requires. I'm not usually into reading books with a violent plot, but I know that I can never go wrong with Coble. She incorporates her faith into her books as if it's a part of who she is (which I'm sure that it is), and she never includes any details that leave me laying awake at night staring at the ceiling, afraid to close my eyes (don't judge me). I also like how although this book has a somewhat modern plot, it is actually historical fiction. The time period in which this book was based upon just enhanced it's appeal all the more. I can't wait to read Coble's next book. I hope that she doesn't keep us waiting for too terribly long!

I loved the premise and all the characters. They were well written and enjoyable. Lily was a great hero. She cared about everyone. Belle who had started off with a heart but arrogance due to her class turned into a great woman. Drew exciting and dashing. I loved that the secret passage in the house. It was sad when victims were killed and well written. It was the last 20 pages when the events intensified that I slowed down. So much was happening so fast in 20 pages it made it difficult to keep going. I just loved the entire story. The position of Lily as a maid was the gem in this story. Someone with so little power, yet she was able to be helpful and a sleuth.

The narrative held promise but there was much too much going on it felt disjointed. The plot failed to connect thus the transitions were not smooth. Details were overlooked and contradictions appeared numerous times. Coble is ambitious but her efforts hindered rather than helped. The many incidents occurring in such a small town at once is implausible and overly contrived. I felt both plot and characters were not fitting of the time period.The characters demonstrated behavior and socially unacceptable actions revealing an awkwardness not fitting the plot or 1900's setting.If the plot could have been pieced together cohesively, with a lot less going on it would have made for a plausible and engaging storyline. The characters or the time frame could have been corrected to fit the revised narrative and possibly salvaged the story. As the story stands it's too disconnected and overly planned for my taste.

The narration was like listening to my kindergarten teacher and it was extremely off-putting. Not only did I dislike the quality of the narrator's voice, but her accents were HORRENDOUS!That said, I tried not to let the narration color my opinion but still didn't like the book. I thought Lily was an idiot who couldn't keep her mouth shut. I have no idea why I'm supposed to have liked her because even though she \"transformed into a butterfly\" due to her adversity, I didn't see her work for anything. The first night at work she's promoted to a personal maid, then the guy who broke her heart pursues her practically right away (and if I heard about \"the moisture in her eyes\" one more time I was going to break a disk in half), and she can basically run about town without retribution from her bosses?? Does she even work anymore?My next issue is her deciding to become an amateur sleuth. She has no tact, no cunning, no stealth, how is it that she wasn't murdered? And the fact that Drew tells her in confidence that he's working for the SS and then she goes and runs her mouth to whomever she deems worthy? Totally unrealistic, folks (added to that fact that Drew doesn't seem to care she's trying to blow his cover. I'd think that would turn him off, but no, he's gotta be her hero/savior). Oh, and let's not forget the many bumps in the night that she heard and basically disregarded. I tell you, she was more afraid of those stupid butterflies than the fact that someone was creeping around the house. Example: In chapter 33, despite the fact that she knew something fishy was going on with the carriage house and that someone had been hunting Jane, Lily leaves Jane (and the baby) alone in the cottage. This naturally leads to: \u201cshe heard something from inside. A sliding noise, then a thump as though something had fallen.\" / \"The first thing Lily noticed was the cloying coppery stench in the air. Then she saw Jane on the floor with blood pouring from her throat. As soon as she fell to her knees beside her friend and touched her arm, Lily knew she was dead.\u201d Moron.So let me leave Lily alone before I become the ultimate mean girl and focus on the fact that there really weren't any redeemable or sympathetic characters. There was a lot of emphasis put on Everett Marshall's political ambitions yet I didn't see much of that, only heard about his being pro-Suffragette movement and that if he died someone else could take his seat. Why should I care about him just because he took in his niece, spoiled her, and spends insane amounts of money on butterflies? And speaking about Belle... I thought her character transformation was sudden and ridiculous. First, let's focus on how all secondary characters kept telling Lily to give Belle a chance because she's had such a rough life (aka, Mommy and Daddy poured money over her but didn't love her enough), yet every time we were in Belle's perspective, she was totally unlikeable, snobby, and self-centered. And now onto what I think is the most out of character behavior for someone of her station in her time period: Her willingness to listen to a house maid in regards to spying on her fiance in order to gain intelligence on the plot to kill her uncle for the sole purpose of aiding the man she truly wants despite the fact that the man wants the maid (breathe!). And this craziness is supposed to bring about a change in character within a few days (insert the WRONG! buzzer sound)? Let's now look at the murderer... could there please have been a bit more behind his motivations besides the fact that Mommy Dearest suffered from MPD and that he was a complete sociopath? I mean, again, come on, there needed to be a reason behind the similarities in his victims (I, for one, would've liked it to be because he was in league with Vesters, who wanted to get rid of Jane, and therefore enlisted the murderer to kill women who looked like her so no one would know who the main target was).I could continue hating on the one dimensionality of all the characters, but I'm not. Instead, I'm moving on to the lack of plot. I was intrigued by the hurdles of Lily running into her ex-fiance and then the murderer wreaking havoc on the city, but neither one of those were addressed very well. I felt that she and Drew should've had more obstacles and that the whole murderer thing should've been scarier. In fact, I feel like there was more focus on the counterfeiting than the murdering. Add to that the twist of who the master mind actually was and... EPIC FAIL! Truthfully, I didn't mind that twist, what with all the red herrings being thrown around, I felt it was quite ingenious. But let us not forget that there is absolutely no explanation as to the master mind's motivations; a slight allusion, yes, but no real reason. And now, Ballard. He was simply too easy, plus there's more lack of reasoning behind his actions. Was he ever actually good? Did greed make him turn to the Dark Side? Was the master mind behind the counterfeiting or just the assassination plot? So how did Ballard and the master mind hook up? CONFUSING CONFUSING CONFUSING! Throw in the murderer and there are too many chefs in the kitchen.Succinctly: Don't waste your time."}, {"userName": "Marg", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4046173-marg", "userReview": "This book was a disappointment.
