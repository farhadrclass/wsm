This novel, inspired by John Lennon's Imagine, is particularly relevant today with religious ideologies tearing the world apart. The 'what if' supposition, what if Jesus had been an alien, made a great premise. DNA discoveries are presented, as well as miracles that result from alien capabilities instead of the mystical hand of god. Cool jewels. This set up presents an opportunity for a fantastic exploration of mankind, religion, and possibilities for a grand metaphysical exploration. Or, it could be a fun cat-and-mouse chase game with sparkly gems scattered about--sort of like Dan Brown's religiothriller work where the reader may sense depth, but the mechanics of the story are designed to provide an alternative viewpoint or philosophy which is spoon fed by the author. I felt this novel was the latter, and delivered the experience fairly well. My rating is 3.5 stars. However, for me, a 4 or 5 star novel of this nature would need to provide the former...woo me with what it would really mean for the world's population to have their belief blanket ripped out from beneath them. Another aspect that prevented my utter enjoyment was that the bad guys were functional, but a little too canned, too familiar. If an alien race was as superior as those in this novel, they needed to be more alien, more intelligent, than I feel I can imagine...like 2001: A Space Odyssey. Otherwise, Jesus just seemed like a dude on a mission, not very superior intellectually, just with better tools."}, {"userName": "H.M.

Well, Lex Allen has written a book about just that, with his own unique twist: humanity got it wrong, and Jesus is a being of an advanced race from another world!From the moment you begin this novel, your mind begins racing. Where is Jesus really from? What will he do and say next? How will humanity react? Along the way, the author introduces an array of really cool paranormal/psychic concepts, such as telepathy, quantum leaping, psychic healing, and multi-universes/dimensions, all in a way that makes you think, and lets the reader decide.It's a book that was begging to be written, and I'm glad someone has. It offers something just a little bit deeper than most of what else is out there, and it's entertaining too, maintaining a good balance between being serious and being fun throughout. At times, it felt like I was watching a box-office thriller, and I mean that in the best possible way! I am excited to see what happens in book 2 and will be starting it soon."}, {"userName": "carol ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6193301-carol", "userReview": "This is an excellent book, though note it is the first of a trilogy, the second book is due end of May/Early June I'm reliably informed. It is a religious thriller with a difference, original, well researched, knowledgeable and very readable. It has a little of the Dan Brown & James Rollins styles, but I personally find it better. It takes a knock at organized religious doctrine and dogma, it also has anti global corporation elements too. It uses scientific quantum theory to explain life, God and spirituality and the writer Lex does this far better than any of the explanations to be found in any of the main religion's Holy Books, such as the Bible. I found myself hoping, yearning even, that these theories backed by scientific explanation were real and not fiction. However, it is fiction but the scientific references he used are factual and incorporated in an appendix at the end. The author shows what may happen should the character Jesus reappear. His characterization of Jesus being of a kind, compassionate man; yet strong minded in his determination to correct the errors that have been carried out by organized religion, supposedly in his name. The real threat today of nuclear holocaust between the main religions of Christianity, Islam and Judaism is identified. Jesus has returned to correct humanities wrongs. Scientific facts and well known theories are explained simply for the non specialist to be able to follow easily and explain miracles and events from 2000 years ago during the historicity of Judaism, and the earliest beginnings of Christianity whilst set in the times of the powerful, all encompassing Roman Empire. The interests and intentions of the FBI and CIA along with the research of the factual Noetic Institute all ring true as well. I'm sure they would want to get there hands on anyone called Jesus who can apparently appear then disappear to reappear halfway across the world in moments at will; purely in the interests of national interest, national security and scientific research of course. Lex has developed his protagonist characters well, whom I quickly empathized with and introduces an evil self serving antagonist into the mix but who appears to have limited exposure in this first book and I feel sure more will be seen or felt of him and his evil intentions. I can't recommend this enough. For those that know me it's far outside of my usually preferred genres but I feel I've read what will become a well known thriller. This novel has been edited and shows a good standard of English language. I have no hesitation in awarding 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Seeley James", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7806167-seeley-james", "userReview": "Was Jesus Christ an alien visitor? I've been involved in the Episcopal Church for twenty years and find that explanation as good as any. It might tick off a few fundamentalists, but Mr. Allen is a brave writer for putting his concepts down on paper. He's also done his homework. I've rarely seen such depth of research and history in a Christian text. His knowledge of the Bible, first century events, quantum physics, and current science is remarkable. The story is imaginative and interesting. He keeps even the skeptical reader riveted to the outcome. He does a better job than Dan Brown.If you're agnostic, unaffiliated, or open minded, this book is well worth the time and effort. If you love your fundamentalist dogma, you might need a stress ball--but you'll enjoy it as well.Peace, \nSeeley"}, {"userName": "Shane Jeffery", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12416492-shane-jeffery", "userReview": "The first thing we\u2019ll get out of the way are my reading preferences, because you can\u2019t trust a reviewer until you know what it is they like. My favorite books usually fall into Horror, Mysteries, Suspense Thrillers and True Stories. I like to think I can take an objective stance to writing and evaluation outside of my personal expectations; meaning that if the book is great, I\u2019ll hopefully be able to see that.Classifying Lex\u2019s book in terms of genre, isn\u2019t an easy task. It seems here we have something for everyone. The general plot follows an Action / Adventure storyline, and the characters that come from that are expected. But there are also elements of Sci-fi, Paranormal, Suspense, and God forgive me for saying it \u2013 Romance. While there is some violence, and a few of the supporting characters are dark beneath their core \u2013 there is little in the way of course language, and it seems geared to embrace the mainstream reader. There are certain fundamental backbones to storytelling that haven\u2019t been messed with, so that a wide audience will be left satisfied.Second Advent has its strengths, and it has its weaknesses. Reading through previous reviews of this novel, the main selling point seems to be its readability. It\u2019s definitely a page turner, I\u2019ll give you that. Lex has a remarkable way of introducing characters and instantaneously getting the reader on their side. Every character in the book has a dynamic presence of depth, making them feel like real people we are actually watching in front of our eyes, and he performs this task effortlessly. I think this might be one of the best things about Second Advent and my impression of the writer \u2013 his characters. Not only do they connect with the reader on a multitude of levels, but some are extremely interesting specimens, completely divorced from clich\u00e9, and searing images into the mind that will not fade. I think that if we look back at all the great characters in literature, there will always be some that stand out, that are recalled instantly. The Second Advent has a whole cast of them, and for that Lex deserves my applaud.But then, characters aren\u2019t everything. The main plot focuses around the Second Coming of Christ, and his gathering of Disciples. Pretty much as the title says. Lex takes liberties here, giving a fictional take on the who-what-how-why of it all, which will probably irk some religious people who want to get bible-quotey because it doesn\u2019t gel with the Second Coming they have envisioned. Being an atheist, I\u2019m not one to get into a debate on these matters. Obviously everyone is entitled to their opinion, and if you\u2019re not interested in reading someone else\u2019s, then don\u2019t. Of course this is all fiction, and I\u2019m assured by the Afterward that Lex isn\u2019t declaring the book a premonition of things to come. You can see there that he has done enormous amounts of research to create a scenario that is both believable, and historically correct, though I\u2019m not sure how important that is. The main thing should always be to tell a good story, and keep your reader interested. Since I\u2019m not versed in bible trivia or quantum physics or any of the other intricacies at play, I found myself zoning out during these parts. A great deal of effort has been made to make sure this book lines up with the specifics of the bible, and recreates things to this effect, while expression plenty of opinions and theories. Me, and my simple brain, couldn\u2019t connect with these parts in the story. I do appreciate them however, it is just not my personal choice for reading. What I want is a constantly evolving story, vivid characters, twists, insights and a sense of understanding. Lex has touched on all of these, but barring his vivid characters, I feel that the deep exploration of the subject matter may have come at expense of the story. While the character of Jesus was one of my favorites, I felt the worst parts of the novel was when he was preaching to the other characters about things I just didn\u2019t understand.Oddly, my favorite parts of the novel involved some of the minor characters. While leads Jack Schmidt and Beth Washburn are the likable everyman and woman, asshole detective Matt Martinson, psychopathic illusionist Carl Eagle, and the enigmatically diabolical One, push the story forward to depths of intrigue and captivation that really set the novel out from the crowd. I understand Disciples is part of a trilogy, and I am very much looking forward to hopefully seeing more of these characters, as to garner a better impression of where they sit in the overall story.Concluding, this book comes with my recommendation to anyone who has an interest in the previously listed genre\u2019s. Yes, it has something for everyone. I can easily imagine this will be produced as a film someday, and its impact will hit home in many and profound ways. I have a feeling that things will steadily improve during the next book, and I look forward to reading it in the near future."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth Newton", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17022919-elizabeth-newton", "userReview": "\u201cNo Heaven\u201d is very different from anything I\u2019ve read before, as it is an interesting mixture of science-fiction, religion, theology and conspiracy. And as a Christian, I experienced an interesting mixture of emotions; finding it intriguing, frustrating, stimulating, and infuriating \u2013 all at the same time. First let\u2019s deal with the technical aspects. The book is easy to read because the chapters are relatively short, the paragraphs are short and there is a nice balance of dialogue and narrative. Although finding myself having to forgive several grammatical and formatting errors, I found it to be a non-laboured, stress-free read, regardless of the heavy subject-matter.Rather than being a fast-paced, action-packed science fiction adventure, this story moves quite slowly, allowing the reader to get a very wide picture of how the current events (i.e. the widely debated, controversial, and confusing second coming of Jesus) are affecting different people in different parts of the world and the different world authorities. Near the beginning, nearly every chapter introduces a new character and their reactions and beliefs in response to the strange happenings. This is interesting \u2013 seeing all these different opinions of who Jesus is and why he\u2019s come \u2013 whether it\u2019s a hoax, whether he\u2019s a magician, whether he\u2019s out to cause trouble, or whether he\u2019s the real-deal Son of God.All the characters are well described and developed. This makes the characters (especially the main characters) very well rounded and I find myself very interested to find out what happens in their lives, particularly: what is it going to take to get Jack to believe?It is evident that there has been extensive historical, religious and military research done to weave this story together and I take my hat off to Lex Allen for putting in the hard yards. As a Christian I have found a few things, however, that have been misunderstood of Christianity and therefore, it\u2019s not a book for Christians who are easily angered by these kinds of misconceptions. For a Christian to enjoy this book, you have to temporarily (for the sake of fiction) get it out of your head that Jesus is the Son of God and (at the same time) an ordinary man, and think of Him instead as somebody COMPLETELY different \u2013 not even human\u2026 (as the name of the trilogy instructs: \u201cImagine\u201d). This is hard to do sometimes because at the beginning of some chapters, Allen quotes scripture \u2013 the very thing his \u2018Jesus\u2019 is saying isn\u2019t quite true.But overall, and personal faith aside, this is a very different, very interesting and very cleverly construed piece of fiction! Allen has layered his own fictional story over the top of Biblical events in order to create a back-story for what is happening, allowing everything that \u2018fictionally\u2019 happened to be completely different from what \u2018actually\u2019 happened, while still appearing the same. If you\u2019re a Christian, you\u2019ll know that this is a dangerous territory to enter into, but Allen makes it clear that it\u2019s a work of fiction, just to lay to rest any potential uprise of Christian doorknockers around Lex\u2019s home."}, {"userName": "Danny Tyran", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12973215-danny-tyran", "userReview": "I have the habit of reading scientific magazines. For years, there have been papers about quantum physics theory and all that could involve, e.g. parallel universes existing in the same time period that ours or in completely different times and worlds with more than four dimensions. This theory could also explain what the authors of science fiction had fun imagining such as telepathy, levitation, teleportation (here without machine: quantum leap), telekinesis, healing by mind power, plants communicating with each other, worlds totally or just slightly different from ours, where duplicates of us live, and so on.But it is not just science fiction. Scientists talk about it more and more seriously in increasingly serious scientific magazines.I must also say that I have not been misled by the idea that Jesus could be someone from another world and that people in his world would have made \u200b\u200bsure to give a little boost to the evolution of the human species. The idea is far from new. Think of 2001: A Space Odyssey. And the idea that Jesus was not completely dead when taken down from the cross is not new too. That the Catholic Church has distorted Christ's words does not surprise me either. I didn't know though that the Catholic Church (Pope Paul IV) had so badly treated the Jews and that maybe if the Church didn't agree not to interfere with Hitler's plan, he would never have come to power.I am, moreover, a reader of Dan Brown's novels; author to whom Lex Allen compares easily.As for Heaven, it is a mixture of all these elements organized in a thriller, the kind about which you absolutely want to know on every page what happens next.So either you're a Catholic believing fiercely in the Church dogmas and you'll hate everything that this book tells about the birth and evolution of this Church. Either you're more open-minded and you'll enjoy reading this novel whose central character is not only Jesus, but quantum mechanics.I recommend this book to all readers of thrillers or science fiction; after all, \"science fiction\" means \"fiction with a scientific basis.\" But I especially recommend it to anyone who loved Dan Brown's novels . They will certainly love this book too."}, {"userName": "Danielle Tremblay", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13712421-danielle-tremblay", "userReview": "No Heaven is about the return of an alien from another universe who identifies himself as Jesus. He states that he is not the Son of God, the Bible is inaccurate, the Resurrection never occurred, and the Pope is hiding ancient documents. He's returned to stop a nuclear war between religions and to abolish Christianity.But then Yeshua (Jesus) makes miracles, disappears somewhere and reappears many hundred kilometres away minutes after the disappearance, speaks that universal language that sounds like Aramaic but that everybody understands whatever their own language, and survives a deadly wound.This story works on two levels. On the surface, it's a supernatural thriller with a religious tread - think Dan Brown and alikes - with science-fiction (other worlds, aliens, theory of quantum mechanics,...) and supernatural. If this is the kind of story appeals to you, read it; you'll love it.However, scratch beneath the surface - think about how this story relates to the real world - and there is much more, with questions about the direction religion (and things done in the name of religion) and the politics around it are taking the world. It should get you thinking about what the ultimate outcome is likely to be, and hopefully will start you pondering about what can be done to change that direction.This is a page-turner and an interesting thriller. I'd like to read something more linked to the theory of quantum mechanics, something more S-F (yeah, I love good S-F). But I loved this book and I'll read the sequel.P.-S.

The earthlings, however, are unaware that their race for nuclear power will soon be their undoing. But like in the Bible, when Man can no longer live without wallowing in the sinfulness of this world, a savior arrives.Mr. Allen has written a thought provoking opening to his trilogy that mixes religion with science fiction and throws in a love story that survives the test of time to boot. The book presents answers to age old questions with new age, plausible supposition. The book represents to me, not a condemnation of the belief in Jesus, but an affirmation of the hidden abilities of Mankind. The thriller is fast paced but slows to explain quantum theory, space travel and the idea of life forms that are alien only in the fact that they were not born on this planet. The reader travels from Germany, to our nation's capital to the crucifixtion of Jesus Christ all in the blink of an eye. A thriller ride that takes you through space and time and delivers you right at the door of No Hell, the next book in the trilogy.

I was wrong. I found myself wanting to savour each part of this interesting book, which as it progressed turned into the likes of something I don\u2019t think I have ever read before. I found myself waiting until I was done for the day before picking it up, and only reading one or two chapters before laying it down to digest what I had read.In one sense the reader may feel that there is a main protagonist in this book and, if you can pinpoint which of the many characters this is, they will find that they are just as thoughtfully well written as any of the others that appear throughout its pages. All the characters are given different backgrounds and, with their varying belief systems this adds dimension to each encounter they have as the book progresses; it adds layers to an already intriguing and well thought out novel. The Author chose wisely when including so many \u2018religions\u2019 for his characters, as it provides the reader with someone they can personally identify with, whether they be Christian or not. The flaws and traits of all characters in the book make them believable and possibly, make you feel you have met someone like them in your everyday life.The locations for this novel are sweeping, ranging from Germany to the high desert and all points near and not so near. It is apparent from the detail that the Author included in his descriptions that he either has an in-depth personal knowledge of these areas or has done extensive research into them to ensure they are as authentic as possible. However, as with a piece of work that chooses this topic as its subject matter, there is a great deal of artistic license taken in the writing and, in this case, this really works; the inclusion of conspiracy theories, paranormal occurrences and historical accounts mesh nicely together to make this a complete and unbiased viewpoint of what is a highly flammable issue. There are so many different strata, points of view, opinions and hypotheses to this novel that it would be hard to place it only in the sci-fi genre, it is not just a good sci-fi novel it is more. Although at times it can read like a personal attack on the Church by the Author, I felt that this was not so much a denouncement of organized religion but another way of looking at something that is so prevalent and influential in a lot of people\u2019s lives today. Good editing and proof reading add to the consistent and easy to follow flow of the book, helping the reader who may be having trouble getting to grips with the ideas included in its pages have the time to digest and think about what they have read. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and will definitely be reading the remaining two instalments of this trilogy.I would highly recommend this book to any reader with an inquiring mind that is open to new interpretations of an old theme; also those who enjoy the sci-fi genre would mostly likely find this book an interesting read.Originally reviewed on: http://catesbooknuthut.com/2013/10/17...\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License."}, {"userName": "Ginger Gelsheimer", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20010724-ginger-gelsheimer", "userReview": "Brief synopsis: Jesus has come back to Earth and has a mission to stop a religious nuclear war. He wants people to understand that all the religions are based on untruths about who he really is and if he is the true Son of God. In order to carry out his mission, he must rely on a few of his ancient friends who have been reincarnated in present day.As one may expect, when Jesus tries to communicate who he really is, he is met with certain disbelief. It doesn\u2019t matter that he can speak a language that everyone can understand, heal the sick and bring back the near dead.As a writer of conspiracy theory, I love to read other authors who delve into the unknown and push the imagination far outside the box. Lex Allen did a fantastic job creating the believable and hostile environment Jesus most likely would find himself in if he came back to Earth.Originality: I thought No Heaven was originally and clever, giving Jesus a new story, but one that could have happened and one that would be believable to many, especially those that believe we are not alone in the universe.Characters: Jesus was well-developed and I enjoyed his persona. Though he is \u201cspecial\u201d, he is realistic and down to Earth (no pun intended, well maybe). He laughs at jokes, he is caring and considerate, but he can also be a badass if he doesn\u2019t get what he wants. I enjoyed the main characters Beth and Jack, each on a different side of the fence about who this long-haired hippy really was. Both already non-believers but when Jesus starts performing impossible tricks, they must come to their own realization. Then there is poor Kate-hopefully she makes it out okay.There were several \u201cB\u201d characters and plot lines that came into play because obviously when Jesus comes down, everyone has something at stake, rather you are highly religious or not. The ramifications of the end of the Church as people know it would turn the Earth upside down on its heels. Some things were left open-ended, but I am guessing they will come back in the sequel, No Hell.I also thought Mr. Allen did a great job with the dialogue. It was realistic, catchy and clever.Recommendation: This book goes well with red wine and hot bread for obvious reasons.

But it's well written, and would be much better suited to someone else. Just because I disliked it doesn't mean you will too.The only real issue I had with the text was recurring problems with quotation marks, dialogue not having the beginning quotation, or not having the end quotation when switching to a different speaker. It didn't slow me down as much as it would have had I been more involved in the story, but it still made me reread sentences.For me, it was a miss. I enjoy a subversive take on religion and mythology, and toward the latter part of the book, it kinda delivered. It was well researched, and could have been an interesting concept, with a different presentation. But the first half of the book didn't read that way. It was filled with characters making assumptions because it suited the plot, and a \"we all WANT to believe\" tone, especially in those assumptions, that offended my inner agnostic, and made more than half the book read as a much more conventional Jesus-in-modern-times tale than it ended up being. By the time the interesting material came, I'd already given up on connecting with the characters, and just wanted to know whether my initial guess about the overall message and intent was right, or whether there was some third-act twist that would present something else. I never was able to connect with the characters, and some of the later events that relied on those characters' charisma just made me roll my eyes.But it has a lot of strong points- as I mentioned, it's well researched. The notes at the back were an interesting read, and were definitely incorporated thoroughly throughout the story, posing some interesting mythological and spiritual questions. It's pretty well written and presented, and the plot would be fascinating if written and paced differently. For those who are less of a skeptic than me, or who are less skeptical toward Christianity anyways, it may be that perfect dose of subversion and belief. And it's certainly a more openminded take than the usual Left Behind end-of-the-world righteous-porn.You won't go wrong in reading it.

The story is very heavily dialogue driven, which is a shame because I do like a bit more description that runs beyond info dumps. The pace was fast enough to keep me interested and writing was a high enough quality to not notice that I've read 50-100 pages in one sitting. This book is perfect for people who love a different take on the origin of religion. You might also like this book if you are a believer of the law of attraction or hold some New Age belief system. All of which come across strongly in this book. Don't read if you are easily offended if you don't like Catholicism or Christianity interpreted. The author's opinions on religion are more new age and heavily anti-religion, but he focuses on Catholicism as the primary 'bad guy'. Since most Western religions tend to hold Catholicism at it's core...just take the above in consideration.My only irk is that I felt that the female characters were clich\u00e9 and very 2 dimensional. Beth, a brilliant world renown expert on theology, comes off as flaky and despite having her faith shaken based on her research she seems just too easily persuaded to join the Jesus is real fan club. It was irritating but I could get past it until much later in the book, the author does a great big reveal which is basically the equivalent of any fan girl's wet dream. We go to the other extreme with Jack, an atheist who despite everything he experiences doesn't move an inch with his belief system. Then all of a sudden, it's Jesus fan club applicant. In these particular cases, the transition from non-believer to believer was not very fluid or gradual. It felt jarring actually.I felt the same way with the romance. It's felt like \"Now we're in love\". Okay he definitely tells us that they're attracted to one another , but as a reader, I didn't feel it. Final verdict, it's well written and well worth the read for entertainment value."}, {"userName": "Judith-Victoria Douglas", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22263596-judith-victoria-douglas", "userReview": "A fiction full of possibilities, this book was a joy to read. It tells a story that could be more real than most realize, if you know the truth about our history of religions. I have tried to tell something similar, but without the \"return\" factor, so with this one I can honestly say I couldn't have said it better myself. It's amazing how possible this is. And the message it puts across is not based on some diabolical attempt to exorcise a religious belief, but to show how misguided it really is. If it pointed out the caveman attitude toward deities it might make it clearer, since suggesting Abraham's original view doesn't seem impactful enough.The characters are presented well within their context and the reader will properly love or hate them. The action and pauses make it a page turner. The plot is clearly defined, for you know at some point there will be a reckoning. The cliffhanger at the end makes you wish the next book was already in hand.Each chapter has a quote from a historical person that speak volumes. I particularly like the ones by Hitler and Seneca, statements that should awaken the awareness centers of the sleeping person if they allow themselves to focus on them. There is little here I disagree with for I have encountered more individuals like the police detective than any like Jesus, and they all call themselves Christians.To use John Lennon's words as a theme shows that lost visionary's image of the ideal world as far-seeing and desirable. What will it take for more to wake up to the fact that religion is another form of politics and the root of all evil in the world? Good people may be hidden within it, but its fear that keeps them there. My brother thinks it is better to believe in a God and there isn't one, than to not believe and there is. That's a CYA attitude that doesn't work on that level. There may be a price for wisdom, but it has never been the loss of your soul.Highly recommend this book to everyone who can read, or can be read to and comprehend."}, {"userName": "Ubiquitous Bubba", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15450370-ubiquitous-bubba", "userReview": "No Heaven is the first book in the Imagine trilogy written by Lex Allen. As the title suggests, the book is based in part upon the philosophy expressed by John Lennon's music. Published originally as \"The Second Advent: Disciples\", the book was re-titled and re-released in 2013.No Heaven presents the return of an alien from another universe who identifies himself as Jesus. He states that he is not the Son of God, the Bible is inaccurate, the Resurrection never occurred, and the Pope is hiding ancient documents. He's returned to stop a nuclear war between religions and to abolish Christianity.The book follows several individuals from different backgrounds and belief systems as they encounter and come to terms with this Jesus. Based in part on historical accounts, numerous conspiracy theories, paranormal abilities, scientific hypotheses, and a significant amount of artistic license, the story presents a world where faith is a delusion, religion is nothing more than crowd control, and God may be a disinterested, impersonal mortal alien.The book is reasonably well written, with some believable main characters. The plot moves at a relaxed pace that allows time to explore the emotions and reactions of characters. At times, some of the narration and dialog dives a little deep into exposition. The book is well edited, flows consistently, and is easy to follow.At its heart, this book is not just a Sci-Fi story. The overall worldview of the author comes through so very strongly, that it reads more like a personal denouncement of Christianity. The book is heavy handed in its portrayal of the church and Christians in general as either evil or devoid of any good qualities. The treatment is so pervasive, that it is hard to ignore. Given that the focus is almost exclusively against Christianity, I had to wonder what personal trauma or experience may have triggered such a strong reaction."}, {"userName": "G.G.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5161183-g-g", "userReview": "I'd have to say that No Heaven is a unique story. I don't think I've ever read anything like it: a nowadays Jesus? Bring it on! People with strong beliefs might take offense reading this story. I didn't. To be honest, this is something I often pondered about, something the hubby and I often discussed. To fully enjoy the book, you have to get in it with an open mind and remember that it's a fiction and not the author trying to rewrite the bible. Once you do that, you'll be able to appreciate the twists and turns in this wonderful story. The author succeeded in making the characters believable. The explanations given made sense. I could set aside what I've learned, the religion I grew up with, and enjoy this new angle. Now, on the minus side. While the book is well written, some of the dialogues (or almost monologues at times) had me go back and check for brackets. I don't mind a long monologue that continues on numerous paragraphs when they are scarce (because they are sometimes hard to follow). These happened very often. More than once, I had to go back and make sure it was the same character speaking. Also, the parts where the author switched to what was happening in Rome and with the Pope lost me also. Try as I might, I couldn't get into it. While I was devouring the book otherwise, when I encountered these segments, I was loosing interest. I can't even tell if they were important. (They must have been.) I read them, sure, but I don't think my mind registered what the words said, if that makes any sense? Maybe it's because I wanted to stay with the main characters, where the fun actually was. Over all I really liked the book and I would recommend it to anyone with an open mind to different perspectives."}, {"userName": "Antonio Simon Jr.", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21245621-antonio-simon-jr", "userReview": "\"Imagine there's no heaven. It's easy if you try.\" John Lennon's words helped inspire this \"sci-fi\" novel. I typed the word \"sci-fi\" in quotation marks, because this book is difficult to classify. It's as much a sci-fi novel as it is a religious thriller, and a criticism of organized religion (Christianity in particular). Devout Christians take note: some of the central tenets of the faith come under direct attack. That said, should the reader approach this novel with an open mind, then what there is to be found is a clever story.The plot, in a nutshell (and without spoilers) is this: the being the Christian faith has come to call Jesus returns to Earth. All are shocked to learn this Jesus is not human, rather, he is an alien. This Jesus declares that everything that everyone has come to learn about Jesus from scripture is untrue, and that organized religion has perpetrated a grand lie. In order to save the world from nuclear catastrophe, this Jesus must abolish the very faith that bears his name.On the surface, this book presents a scathing satire of organized religion. I can see how this might upset a large portion of the book's audience. But, dig a little deeper and what you get is a story of how people can give themselves over to an organization (and not necessarily a faith-based organization), never ask questions, and always follow blindly. It also discusses what horrors can occur when collective thought takes the place of independent, rational decision-making.If you like \"Dan Brown-esque\" thrillers with some social criticism tossed in to make you think, then give this one a read."}, {"userName": "Chameleon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22295079-chameleon", "userReview": "This book was engrossing, and as I read, I fully realized the immense amount of research needed to bring this book to the level Mr. Allen did. Strong character development gave you a great sense of the actors, and I easily identified with them because I felt like I knew them. Sweeping locations were also vividly described, and I easily got a sense of where the scenes where taking place.Being a Christian, I don't suscribe to many of the ideas put forth here, but, as a reader, I certainly recognize a very well written book when i see one. Mr. Allen has already conceded to taking liberal artistic license with some things, and, in doing so, has put out a very cleverly woven yarn where all things are possible. And did a very good job of showing WHY they were.I wont go into a blow by blow account of the action as much has already been written here in all the other reviews. Suffice it to say, if you're looking for a really good, engrossing read- and your beliefs aren't easily offended, you'll love this book. It has all the action, adventure, and suspense you could probably stand in one book, and even a bit of long lost love- and I mean a really long lost love- hehehe.I will be reading the next one, No Hell. Doing a trilogy of such intensity would be tough I think, and I'm interested to see if that intensity will carry through in the next book.

The pace of the story is excellent.

We don't stay with one, but explore the beliefs and emotional worlds of several characters, which makes this story intriguing. The story is woven around this question: What would you do if Jesus returned to the earth?Well, what would you do? That is the premise that Lex Allen explores in this intriguing thriller/fantasy. \"Simple\" people have no problem believing in Jesus's abilities, but professionals and the government, and the Vatican get involved trying to explain away the fact that there is this amazing individual come to the world to see some historical and religious records straight. I think the book poses a lot of questions of what we really believe and explores the barriers we have put up to protect against anything that is out of the norm. The story puts you on the spot: Which camp are you with? Is your life filled with dogma and fear, or can you accept a greater reality expressed by someone with a higher perspective and abilities than we as a species reject at this point in time? I find the questions, which are very appropriate for our current society, very intriguing. The writing itself is smooth and seamless, and flawless.

I think that is probably because the Pope in the book is extremely different from the current Pope - I am not Catholic (in fact, I'm not even Christian), but I think the current Pope is one of the greatest men alive.Full Disclosure: I am a Goodreads author and my books may or may not be reviewed by the author of this book.

After getting over the distracting paragraph breaks, as there are many, the story flows well and is intricately told. As complex as it is, each character has an important role that pushes the plot forward. I, unfortunately, don't get the feeling of caring for any of the characters, which made me want to complete the story only to get to the end of it. Being part of a series, there's no surprise that questions are still raised by the end of this first part. The ending, however, was too abrupt and gave no sense of finality.Being Christian, I also found the basis of the story far fetched. Written in a style of providing facts and arguments, I had to remind myself that it is meant to be fiction, which made it a bit more tolerable.

Lex does a wonderful job of creating a somewhat irreverent and unique Jesus who is both far more approachable than we could have ever dared imagine, and also far more fascinating that most of us could have thought possible. The treatment of the Catholic Church is going to upset some people, but the manner in which quantum physics is introduced in the book makes me wish I took more interest in physics when I was in school. Truly, what Lex has done is to force us to reconsider our personal truths and to re-evaluate so many of the received truths we take for granted. Personally, I loved the way the book deconstructs organized religion; it takes a certain amount of courage to do that in this day and age, and good on Lex for being courageous enough to take that step.
