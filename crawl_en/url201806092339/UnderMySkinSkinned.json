I found myself wanting to read more of Judith's mythology and world building. By the time I finished reading the book, I wanted to read more.The first half of Under My Skin was a little slow for me, but this was due to the building up of the mythology and introducing the reader to the characters and the world in which Judith has created. Being the first in a 3 book series, there needed to be the world building and I think Judith did a good job with it. Had there been a lot of the action that comes later in the book, I think it would have distracted from the mythology and getting to know the characters and what Eyrn is and why she's in Redgrave. I loved the setting of Redgrave.Eyrn is a very snarky, stubborn character who isn't afraid to fight her worst nightmares in the form of werewolves. That's not all that's hidden within Redgrave's small population. Witches, Vampires and more are introduced as we get to know some stand out characters. Be rest a assured there is some great tension in two hot, bad boys that Eryn is torn between.There's the dark, brooding Alec, who she has an immediate chemistry with, but there's something about him that she has yet to figure out. I loved her first meeting of him, when she's running in the woods, and he's running with \"pet\" wolf. Then there's Wade, who she can't help but be drawn to, especially after her dream about him.Eryn will soon find herself torn between Wade and Alec, and the dark secrets that are unraveling around her in Redgrave. As tensions build between Alec and Wade, who are both trying to help Eryn, she will find herself facing the toughest choice of all. Letting her true nature be revealed.I liked Under My Skin and I'm looking forward to reading the second book in the series. Judith's book will be released on March 27th!!**If good reads would allow half star ratings, I would have given it 3.5 stars**"}, {"userName": "Stef", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2307279-stef", "userReview": "**Mild spoilers for first couple chapters**\u201cUnder my skin\u201d revolves around a teenage girl named Eryn who is living a more than complicated teenage life. Her parents have disappeared and she is shipped off to somewhere in northern Alberta to live with her Aunt, Uncle and cousin. On top of all that, you guessed it, there\u2019s some paranormal goodness brewing. Eryn is half human and half wolven, which means that she has the ability to morph into a wolf thanks to her mother\u2019s genetics. Since her father is human and hunter of the paranormal outlaws, she has chosen to live in her human skin but that doesn\u2019t leave her without bloodlust and animal instincts that her wolf side carries deep within her. In this small northern town, Redgrave, everything seems as normal as Eryn appears on the outside. There is typical high school drama and cliques and annoying family members to put the icing on the cake. Eryn befriends a couple outsiders in school hoping to ignore her wolven side from bursting out, but easy and normal doesn\u2019t seem too common to come by in Eryn\u2019s existence. She becomes torn between a beautiful and highly ridiculed boy in town simultaneously while she gets intrigued by the police chiefs can\u2019t-do-no-wrong son who is pretty much king of their school. Even with her best efforts forward, some rogue werewolves begin making a mess in her new town. During her attempts to hunt to keep her town safe, she stumbles over the most unlikely allies and enemies. Like any other paranormal book, nothing is what it seems and trust should be a four letter word.The concept of this book is good. The paranormal details and facts are interesting how they all get wrapped together and the characters are likeable but a little long winded. There\u2019s some good wit and character interaction that you can get hooked on. Only problem I have with this book is the slow pace. A lot more action and revelations could have been stuffed in this pretty book. I\u2019ll be giving the 2nd book a read when it hits the shelves in 2011. The bones of this first book shows some promise, so, I hope we get a lot more meat with our bones next time around."}, {"userName": "Mel Boulrice", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2474090-mel-boulrice", "userReview": "When Eryn's parents go missing, the Council decides it's best that she live with her Aunt & Uncle in Redgrave. On the outskirts to nowhere, they suggest a paranorm-free place like Redgrave would keep her safe as they search for clues to find what happened to her parents. When animals & kids go missing, someone needs to take the blame - the Delacroix family. Eryn struggles as she discovers there's more to this sleepy town then meets the eye!Wow, this debut by Judith is action packed! If you love paranorm, this is one you need to check out. From vampires to werewolves to witches (well there's more but I don't want to spoil it for you), there's no holding back on beasties. Eryn is part wolven (shapeshifter) and part human. Her human father had created concoctions to suppress the wolf inside of her BUT with him gone, so were the meds. Hands down, she was my favorite character in the book, with her kick ass, sarcastic attitude. Her cousin, Paige, is one you love to hate, you can't help but laugh at what she does & sometimes just want to slap her! Of course, there's a hot guy, actually two, but ones a part vampire and we aren't really sure about him. There is a downfall to adding so many characters with so many beastly abilities and unfortunately this means that the plot sorta takes a backseat for a big chunk of the book. Along the way questions are answered, but there were times when I wasn't sure exactly what the conflict in the story was all about. I think however, the very powerful ending more then makes up for this and I'm dying to see where book two takes us!"}, {"userName": "Paranormal Reads", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7102096-paranormal-reads", "userReview": "It was during the night, on my weekly search for new books to add to my reading list that I stumbled across Under My Skin, I have to say when I read the blurb for the book I was sold, I had to get my hands on it, instead of waiting for the following day to go look for a print copy in my local B&N I downloaded it straight to my Nook Color. I loved how the beginning draws you in, Judith as delivered in a way that you can clearly imagine the story unfolding before your eyes. I also have to say usually my first concern is whether or not the continuation of a book will deliver just the same, as I continued to read on through the night I had a hard time wanting to put it down, you know when you were a kid and use to tell your parents just five more minutes? I found myself 40 minutes later still reading. I loved the characters in the book; they each have a unique personality, and found most of the plot refreshing. Mixing a bit of different paranormal beings into one book can be hard, because I had read a few where there have been a mix of paranormal beings but it doesn\u2019t feel as a whole, it feels as if many parts are clinging trying to connect and bring the story together, However Judith Graves does an amazing job of mixing the different aspects of the paranormal into this book. Though there is a bit of a love triangle in the story the plot doesn\u2019t focus on it, however I feel that love triangle will deepened in Judith\u2019s second book in the Skinned Series and look forward to seeing how this triangle develops.4/5 batsMarie from Paranormal Reads"}, {"userName": "Alyson (Kid Lit Frenzy)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1384232-alyson-kid-lit-frenzy", "userReview": "I am not sure where to start without spoiling the story.

Eryn's story is one where she is attempting to learn about herself as a half-wolven, paranormal. She soon finds herself a part of a group of teens who hunt and fight paranormal beasties. And if it wasn't enough to have one resident hottie in the form of Alec Delacroix, hunter, she finds another part of herself attracted to Wade, a vampire and equally hot.

It has secrets, danger and of course a love triangle.I really liked Grave\u2019s spin on werewolves. There are Wolven who are born and werewolves which are made. Eryn is a half breed Wolven who has had her wolf kept in check by a drug her father has been giving her. When her parents go missing Eryn has to deal not only with their loss but also with her primal wolf impulses \u2013 impulses that may put her and those she loves in danger.Eryn also works as a Hunter for The Council - a group that keeps paranormal creatures in check. The council has moved Eryn to Redgrave to keep her safe while they look for her missing parents. Despite her secrets she manages to make a friend in Brit the resident goth chick who warns her against taking up with Alec Delecroix whom she has encounter while running in the woods.OK \u2013 I didn\u2019t really get pulled into this book right away but once Alec entered the picture (it\u2019s always about a boy\u2026isn\u2019t it??) I was hooked.Brit: \u201cHe\u2019s hot alright, but\u2026\u2026..You don\u2019t want to go there.\u201d Eryn: \u201cI don\u2019t?\u201d But the image of his long dark hair, broad shoulders, and powerful thighs had already registered on my but \u2013 I - really - think - I \u2013 do \u2013 want \u2013 to \u2013 go - there interest meter\u201dAlec and his brother Matt are also Hunter\u2019s and Eryn joins with them to help fight the paranorms all while trying to keep her secret fearing Alec will reject her if he finds out.Wade also enters the picture as the sexy son of the local police chief and this sets up a pretty good love triangle. I usually get stressed out over these, but I loved both guys and could see it going either way. I think Alec gets a little short changed once Wade enters the picture but Alec\u2019s mom has a pretty ominous prediction about Alec and Eryn so this storyline is guaranteed to get more time in the next book.There is quite a bit more going on in Under My Skin but I don\u2019t want to reveal spoilers so I hope I\u2019ve peaked your interest enough for you to check it out.I did have a few issues. One was the aforementioned love triangle. As I said I loved both guys and Eryn is drawn to both for different reasons and it makes complete sense. But her response to both boys is pretty intense and gave me a case of whiplash at how fast she could go from guy to guy.It seems that the book walked the line of YA and adult. The themes and romantic interactions bordered on more of an adult paranormal but then it would slip into more of a breezy high school vibe \u2013 lowering the intensity for me.Under My Skin leaves a few things up in the air: Can the council be trusted? Is Wade evil? Is there more to Alec than meets the eye? How far will Eryn have to go to save the ones she loves? And what the heck does that vision mean??? I have my own thoughts on that last one but I will just have to wait and see\u2026arghh \u2013 I\u2019m not the most patient person!Liked: The boys! Nice love triangle. Lays the foundation for a really good series.Nitpick: There were illustrations throughout the book. They were very nice but took me out of the story and I prefer to have my own vision for what a character looks like. Not too distracting though.

This book was about a teenage girl who is part human and part wolf named Eryn. Her parents disappeared and she moved to the town of Redgrave to live with her uncle. aunt and cousin. Eryn met some other teenager from Redgrave that she eventually learned were a lot like her, they all come together to realize there is people trying to ruin the young children of Redgrave by turning them into wolfs. They then figure out that it is not the original person they thought it was and there is a giant fight scene hurting many of the main charter like Eryn, Britt, Matt and Alec.I think that the characters in this book could have been more believable then how they seemed. The main characters encounter many arguments with a vampires in the town because they think he is causing all the problem and changing all the teenagers. My favourite character in the book was Britt because she kept her secret from people so well and used it as an excuse not to run. My favourite part of the book was the fighting scene between Eryn and her friends and the wolves, however my least favourite part is how she did not really make the book as paranormal it was more about a high school life while kinda incorperating paranormal creatures. That is the one thing I would change , I would make it so that it is more around the supernatural type of thing with an even bigger back story then a paranormal book with a small back story. I thought this book would be better then i was told i would recommend this book for people who have interests in fairies, vampires and more paranormal things then supernatural."}, {"userName": "Amber  ~ The Reading Addict", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3172251-amber-the-reading-addict", "userReview": "This book definitely exceeded my expectations. While I'm not a fan of the cover or of the somewhat juvenile pictures found throughout the book, the story was surprisingly good. Graves puts a new spin on things that go bump in the night and those who hunt them. I expected another supernatural romance novel that gained popularity on the tailcoats of the Twilight phenomenon. Instead, I got an original tale of witchcraft and paranormal butt-kicking. Eryn, a snarky teenage girl, has always had a weird and extremely dangerous life. She is forced to walk the line between the supernatural world and the ordinary world. Its easy to see why she's as tough as she is. The entire novel is filled with her sarcastic comments and witty comebacks. Although she puts on the front of a tough girl who can handle anything, she's really insecure and vulnerable underneath. In the beginning Eryn annoyed me a teensy bit, but by the end of the book, I'd really grown to like her. While fighting her worst nightmares and struggling to learn the secrets of her parent's disappearance, Eryn is torn between two very different boys. There's dark, brooding Alec who is a hunter like her. Then there's Wade, who seems to understand Eryn like no one else can, even if he does have a dark side. I really enjoyed this love triangle aspect of the novel. It definitely sets a good foundation for the next books in the series. I'm going to recommend this fun read to anyone that enjoys a good mystery along with some paranormal romance. The Skinned series is currently set to be a trilogy. The next book, Second Skin, comes out on March 27th.

Her closest friends are the Delacroix boys, who seem to have secrets of their own. The police chief's son, Wade, has warned her to stay away from the Delacroix boys, saying that they are bad news, but then again, they say the same thing about Wade. Who is telling the truth?

Judith Graves\u2019 first book in the Skinned series is a great read for both teens and adults. I must admit that I did feel a touch of Twilight deja vu while reading about the love triangle between Wade, Alec, and Eryn, but this book is loads better than Twilight! Beyond the blossoming romance in this novel, there is also the mystery of what is causing all of the paranormal activity in town. Waiting to find out the cause of kids going missing, and the animal attacks, makes Under My Skin a page-turner from beginning to end. The romantics out there will want to know who Eryn is going to end up with.

She was told to lay low after her parents sudden disappearance. However, that's a bit hard when she seems to be a magnet for the paranormal. As soon as she appears in town, the paranormal happenings of Redgrave seem to be popping up everywhere. And while all of this happens, Eryn begins the struggle against her inner she-wolf while balancing a love triangle between one that is evil and one that is kind. A normal life? Yeah, that's Eryn's dreamed fairytale.The plot of this book isn't much different than the average young adult paranormal novel, besides the fact that it's incredibly light-hearted at times. If you've read C.C. Hunter's Shadow Falls Series, you can compare the way that Eryn thinks to the way that Kylie thinks. Serious, but laced with little, sarcastic sayings that make you shake your head. Our protagonist is of half-paranormal descent, but she fought off her paranormal lifestyle with the help of her human fathers drugs. With his disappearance, the medicine that kept her inner wolf at bay vanished, only to let Eryn know that instead of helping her, her father's medicines had separated her from all other wolven of her kind. Somehow, someway, she was different, powerful, and incredibly sought-after. She struggles to keep her secret at bay while uncovering the secrets of the town of Redgrave and fighting off an odd love-triangle that doesn't take center focus of the novel. The characters and mystical beings brought to light in it may be unique, but the plot is pretty self-explanatory, though it was full of some surprises that are too juicy to reveal.The beginning of the novel was a little slow. There was a lot of world-building. Redgrave is so full of the paranormal that there had to be an explanation behind it all. Plus, this is the first in a series. If the world-building didn't happen now, it wouldn't happen at all. After the world-building is over, the plot thickens, secrets come to light, and mysteries unfold before your eyes. And at the end there's some action that will blow any action lovers mind. It's paced well.I was totally shocked when I began turning the pages of this book on my Kindle and realized that pictures were incorporated every now and then. There were possibly only a total of 5 or 6, maybe more for a paperback than a Kindle, but they were all so interesting. Val Cox is a beautiful illustrator and it was a pleasant little surprise that helped you visualize the characters the way the author intended you to do so. I've never come across pictures in a young adult novel before.The characterization in the novel was unique. Eryn was very stubborn and strong. She struggled to keep her identity a secret while coming into her powers, but never let that get in the way of things. She was focused and driven--the type of girl who sprints headlong towards danger instead of away from it. She faces her biggest fears in the form of werewolves without a second though. All of the other characters had odd quirks about them that would come to light as the book continued. You met them and began to speculate on what exactly they were, only to be completely shocked about their true identities and actions. There's an entire assortment of the paranormal in here.If you're looking for a book full of romance, this isn't it. The romance in this novel was odd to say the least. There's one kiss, and one kiss only. Alec and Eryn had this heated passion coursing through them ever since the very beginning of the book. I liked how they met, it was unique. They're running in the woods, racing, trying to outrun each other because they welcomed the challenge of finding someone who could even come close to matching their speed--all while being accompanied by a beautiful wolf. It bonded them and began to churn their curiosity about each other. Alec is beyond protective of Eryn, even going to extremes for her at some times, but he's quiet and laid back. He asserts his authority when needed, but he doesn't pounce on her and drive her mad. The romance is slow-moving.Then there's Wade. Once his true identity comes to light, Eryn and him form some kind of dark bond that nobody can know about. He unravels a lot of the dark secrets going on in Redgrave. Eryn so badly wants to run away from him like everyone tells her to, but the bond is too powerful for her to turn her back on him. He knows of her true nature, and he welcomes it.With everything being said, I am giving this book 3.5 stars. I enjoyed it, despite the slow beginning and the slightly unoriginal plot. Many of the twists and turns involving the secrets of Redgrave took me completely by surprise and kept me reading until the last page. A lot of the characters in the book are full of surprises that will leave you wanting more. Graves finishes off the book with a huge, climatic fight scene that will leave any action lover satisfied. I will be reading the rest of the series whenever I have the time. I want to know what happens with the bond forged between Wade and Eryn and whether or not Alec will be more straightforward with his feelings, though it seems that Eryn has no problem with the silent, strong type. Most of all, I want to know what side Eryn takes. The end of this book will leave her with a life-changing ultimatum that makes you crave the next book."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6982054-michelle", "userReview": "I just happened upon this beauty. I never thought I would sit down and read it start to finish in a few hours, then move onto the sequel Second Skin. I found myself captured by Judith's unique tale of were/witch/vamps and other creatures of the night. The characters are well established and have everyday concerns, well at least if you were a paranorm! I love the world Graves has created. Under My Skin is not your everyday run of the mill boy meets girl, girl falls for boy, HEA. It's more boy meets girl, girl tries to ignore boy, girl wants to eat boy ;) You get my point, hehe.First off we have Eryn, now this girl has bite. Her attitude only equals her hunger for blood. Several times she had me laughing with her witty comments and antics. \"the greedy material of his shirt clung to his muscular shoulders like a jealous ex-girlfriend\". I honestly don't know where the author comes up with some of this stuff. I found that I liked Eryn even though she was not a very approachable character. She was definitely a girl who didn't take crap from people. I have to admire her for that. There are a few alpha MC's out there and Eryn is one of them. I like her!Now is the hard part. We have two very different boys falling for out headstrong heroine. There is Alec and Wade. They are like night and day. My biggest problem....I don't know which one I like more. I mean they both have their merits. Alec looks out for Eryn and he has no problem with trying to get her to follow his lead. (yeah you saw that \"trying\" in there didn't you) Not that he is doing it to control her, but to keep her and the group safe. I get his point. He is the good boy, lets be honest. There were parts I just wanted to squeeze him he was just so dang cute and shy. I think what attracts me to him the most is that he can be all sweet and innocent one minute then all alpha and possessive the next moment. Here ladies is the best of both worlds! *swoon*Then we have the \"Redgrave High's resident hottie\" Wade. Now here's our bad boy. Though we are kept in the dark about Wade and what he really wants from Eryn we still get to see a different side of him here and there. Enough that I have no doubt he does have feelings for her. Needless to say Wade and Alec don't get along. At all. Makes for some really interesting scene's when the three are in the same area. Where Alec could make me swoon Wade could make me shiver. There is definite chemistry between both boys and Eryn. I think this is a series where I am going to be left hurt either way, no matter who Eryn picks. Next up we have some support characters. Brit, Matt and Paige. Brit is the BFF, or I should say she becomes the BFF. I really like her. Once you find out the truth about Brit you will love her as much as I do. She is so cool. Yeah I actually said that. Then we have Matt, Brits BF and Alec's brother. Matt is very verbal in his opinion of Eryn and what he thinks, there is no holding punches with him. Matt is great support for Alec, I love that he care about his brother enough to voice his opinion even if Alec doesn't want to hear it. He loves his brother and it shows. Lastly, we have Paige. Here is the girl we all hate is school, or the majority of us at least. She is just plain mean, nasty and naive. The stuff she says to Eryn are bad, not that Eryn lets her get to her. I guess you could say that they rub each other the wrong way. The banter between them keeps things interesting at least.As you can tell, I thoroughly enjoyed Under My Skin. It is nice to see an author that takes the everyday PNR and turns it is to something of their own. Judith does an amazing job with her spin on the paranormal world. I will admit to some younger readers that this might not be the book for you. There is gore and such, so if you have a queasy stomach, you might want to skip some of the fight scenes. Overall Under My Skin was a great book that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys PNR with a little horror and gore on the side."}, {"userName": "Erin Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3332164-erin-ashley", "userReview": "Okay, so I basically read this book in two days, not because it was utterly enthralling, but because I was eager to see how it would end and if the author was going to make something amazing happen. Nothing amazing happened. I was waiting for something epic to pop out and shock me, but it didn't happen. I might as well get all the good points out first because I have so many more that are bad. I did like the idea of the story and the characters names, I liked how the main character, Eryn, had the same name as me, which held a lot of appeal for me, and I liked how she was badass. I also liked Brit and Alec sounded super sexy to me. Thats where my praise ends. What I HATED, was the tacky drawings inside the book above and below each page and on certain pages there were illustrations of the characters and some scenes. They looked like damn cartoons! It didn't let the book speak for itself when all I could think about was how cartoony the characters began to look in my head. I managed to find a way around that though and imagined myself some attractive and REAL looking characters. What I also couldn't stand was how the-author-kept-talking-like-this-all-the-time-on-every-damn-page. It frustrated me so bad that I almost gave up reading, but for the life of me I couldn't do that because I have to finish a book. Always. What also bothered me was that nothing seemed to flow easily. I found that situations jumped, they weren't eased into and it made me feel on edge the whole time reading it. I couldn't relax with this book. A book of this genre should make you feel edgy for good reasons, not bad, and there should be a point where the edginess is switched up for something more light hearted. I couldn't stand Paige so maybe the author got that part right for me, and I know I said I liked Eryn's bad-assed-ness, but sometimes she seemed more like a guy then a girl. I hate it when girls are borderline male in books. She was written as a girl with strong attributes, at least make her a little more girly at some point besides the fact that she is stereotypically torn between two guys. This book had so much potential and it failed. It is the first of a series and the sucky thing about series is you want to know where it ends. I do admit I am curious about Eryn and Alec's relationship and I want to know where that goes. But basically, thats the only thing I will be reading it for, and to be honest, thats not what should draw me in the most. I still liked the story, but I think this book needed more help before being published."}, {"userName": "Lynn Worton", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7917492-lynn-worton", "userReview": "I was recommended this YA book by Amazon way back in 2011/2 due to my reading and browsing history. I liked the synopsis and fell in love with the cover so I bought a copy. Unfortunately, due to my large reading list, I have only recently been able to read it. However, since purchasing this book, it has since been re-edited and given a new cover in 2014. I can only review the original.Eryn McCain is a wonderful character. She is not your average teen. In fact, she's not even human. Well, okay, she's part human. Her mother is a wolven and her father is human. However, she acts just like a normal teenager at times, full of angst. The only difference is that she is exceptionally strong and fast, and hunts werewolves.This is a fast paced roller coaster ride of action and adventure. I started this book and was quickly engrossed in the tale. I was impressed with the illustrations interspersed throughout the book, but was surprised at their inclusion. However, they gave the reader a chance to picture the characters and scenes more easily, especially if a youngster is not as proficient in reading. I don't know if the illustrations were kept after the re-edit though.There are some interesting characters in the book: Brit, a young goth who has her own secrets. Alec Delacroix is not really a bad guy, but as Eryn has been warned away from the family, she finds herself intrigued with him. Then there is Wade, the police chief's son. He's handsome and charming, but there is something about him that made my skin crawl. When I found out what was going on with him, I felt sorry for him.The story is intricately woven with mystery and suspense. Just when I thought I had figured out what was going on, a twist would occur and I would have to begin again. As the story progressed, I found myself cheering Eryn on whilst sitting on the edge of my seat. I reached the end of the story with sadness, as I wanted to keep reading. I am now looking forward to continuing the series with the second book, Second Skin.Judith Graves has written a fantastic YA paranormal coming of age story. I love her fast paced writing style and the flow was wonderful. There were a few typos, but as this book was re-edited, I would like to think that most of them would have been corrected.I highly recommend this book to young readers aged 12 and above who love stories about werewolves. I also recommend this book to adults who love reading YA paranormal romances. - Lynn Worton"}, {"userName": "Lovey Dovey Books", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6011878-lovey-dovey-books", "userReview": "Originally posted on Lovey Dovey BooksUnder My Skin equals dark, mysterious, and just plain humorous! Judith Graves surprised me with a down to earth heroine with a knack for witty sarcasm and...er, violence. I couldn't get enough of Eryn's spunk, even when her human side clashed with the beastly side she had a way with words.Eryn is sent to the out-of-the-way town, Redgrave, supposedly to stay away from paranorm trouble while the Council searches for her 'dead' parents. While running a race in the woods during gym class, Eryn is stalked by a dirty werewolf and from here the story completely evolves. There's more to Redgrave than Eryn was led to believe and she's roped up into a mission with a rogue team of hunters to find the bottom of paranorm increase in the small town.Under My Skin is filled with all the elements to make a fun teen read: wit, romance, action, and of course, mystery. I should put most emphasis on mystery because there are still some aspects of the novel that haven't been explained. It seems that Eryn's new hunter friends, Alec, Matt, and Brit are not all they seem. While some of their secrets are outed, Alec, Matt, and especially Eryn still have some explaining to do. So far, only a few dark creatures have been introduced, but I have a feeling Graves has many more hiding up her sleeve.\"He smelled of sweet spice and possibilities. He dipped his head. His lips drifted slowly down to mine. The heat of his breath feathered over my sensitive skin. I grabbed his coat collar and pulled myself onto my toes, wanting his kiss and wanting it fast.\" Under My Skin (Kindle Locations 1505-1507)The romance aspect of the novel has a different approach. Eryn isn't afraid to admit her attraction to the two men she meets, but either choice she makes can have a negative effect on her life and the life of those around her. Already, Graves is building a complex love story and fortunately, it doesn't outshine the main plot. There are so many more developments I'm looking forward to in the next installment, Second Skin. I have a feeling that it'll be even more revealing and action-packed! *ebook provided by publisher in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Amanda Croley", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2721716-amanda-croley", "userReview": "I think Under My Skin is targeted toward the middle school age crowd, if it isn't it should be. The book was ok, just more juvenile than I usually like to read. When Graves uses phrases such as twitterpated, and 'I know you are but what am I?' I almost gave up! I doubt I will be reading any further in this series, there are just too many good books to read, and no reason to waste time on the mediocre. I think from now on if a book starts out with the main character walking down the halls of a High School, I should just close it and move on! :)Eryn is sent to live with her Uncle Marcus, Sammi his wife, and their daughter Paige when her parents disappeared. Her father is human, and a hunter of the paranormal world. Her mother is Wolven, a born shapeshifter, not to be confused with werewolves who are made by magic. Her father is also a scientist working on a cure for werewolves. He has given Eryn many different concoctions to suppress her Wolven side. The Hunter Council sent Eryn to Redgrove, told her to stay away from the paranormals, and they would find her parents. *****Spoilers*****Brit is one of the few outcasts of the school, and Eryn quickly becomes friends with her, as she is considered one of the outcasts as well. Paige her cousin doesn't help that at all. She is popular, pretty, and a total bitch. She is not interested in befriending her cousin, or making her life any easier. Eryn is also drawn to the Delecrouix family of hunters. They are not aligned with the council because when their dad was killed on a mission, they refused to help avenge his death. Alec and Eryn are both interested in each other, but she worries if he will feel the same once he learns of her dual nature. Wade, local hot guy, and sheriff's son also makes his interest known. As the story unfolds you realize that Wade is a vampire, and his sire, the Sheriff is pulling his strings. They are making a werewolf army using the local teenagers. Wade eventually helps Alec and his group defeat some of the werewolves but disappears after the battle. Brit reveals her true nature as a dark sprite when she takes to the sky. Sheriff Logan tells Eryn that her parents are alive, he has been tracking them, and if she brings him all of her fathers notes he will spare her friends and family."}, {"userName": "Ellz Readz", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2771201-ellz-readz", "userReview": "My thoughts...I really liked this book. Initially I was a bit put off by the cover, it is a bit plain. However, after an interview with the author, I knew this was something I had to read. I was not disappointed. The brilliantly charming personality of author Judith Graves really shone through in her writing. This is a great read for YA fans of all ages.In Under My Skin, we meet Eryn, a girl who is not only dealing with her missing parents, but a new town full of things that go bump in the night. I liked her, she didn't take much slack from other people, but she showed genuine concern for her family and friends. She meets several people who instantly seem to click with her...and several who don't. The Delacroix brothers are fun to read, they are sort of a yin/yang pair. The characters showed growth through the story, but there was still much about them that wasn't revealed. From looking at the cover you can logically deduce that the story is about Werewolves. This is a good werewolf story. It uses some different folk lure to explain their lives and their appearance. What sets it apart, for me, was the world building and the story structure. Graves has developed this supernatural world that has so much potential. It was described in a way that the reader can really imagine living there and experiencing these harrowing situations. There was a lot of structure laid down to create what I think could be a great series. The other part of my love for this book came in the writing of the story structure. There were a large number of subplots happening at once. Readers learn about several characters who all seemed to have a back story or mystery behind the state of their current lives. All of these stories were well written and did not overburden the reader. They did not take away from plot, but added to it in a very complimentary way. I was very impressed with the writing in Under My Skin.Overall, I loved Under My Skin. At the end of the book, readers are treated to a sample of the next book, Second Skin. This will be on my list, as well as other books by this talented author."}, {"userName": "Mundie Moms & Mundie Kids", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4397975-mundie-moms-mundie-kids", "userReview": "Under My Skin is one of those books, that you sit down thinking you'll read a few pages of it and then a few hours later you're done. I found myself wanting to read more of Judith's mythology and world building. By the time I finished reading the book, I wanted to read more. The first half of Under My Skin was a little slow for me, but this was due to the building up of the mythology and introducing the reader to the characters and the world in which Judith has created. Being the first in a 3 book series, there needed to be the world building and I think Judith did a good job with it. Had there been a lot of the action that comes later in the book, I think it would have distracted from the mythology and getting to know the characters and what Eyrn is and why she's in Redgrave. I loved the setting of Redgrave. Eyrn is a very snarky, stubborn character who isn't afraid to fight her worst nightmares in the form of werewolves. That's not all that's hidden within Redgrave's small population. Witches, Vampires and more are introduced as we get to know some stand out characters. Be rest a assured there is some great tension in two hot, bad boys that Eryn is torn between. There's the dark, brooding Alec, who she has an immediate chemistry with, but there's something about him that she has yet to figure out. I loved her first meeting of him, when she's running in the woods, and he's running with \"pet\" wolf. Then there's Wade, who she can't help but be drawn to, especially after her dream about him. Eryn will soon find herself torn between Wade and Alec, and the dark secrets that are unraveling around her in Redgrave. As tensions build between Alec and Wade, who are both trying to help Eryn, she will find herself facing the toughest choice of all. Letting her true nature be revealed.

Under My Skin was a refreshing read with a new spin on paranormal creatures and they function.Under My Skin was a very enticing read, but at times I found myself slightly confused. There was a very clear overall plot arc, but I felt at times the plot strayed too far from this, never really explaining or giving answers to the questions readers have. This also caused me to be slightly confused as to what was happening in the story at times. This didn't keep me from reading at an insane speed though. Another great thing about Under My Skin was the writing, which was exceptionally good. I felt instantly transported into Eryn's world, which was a place I really enjoyed being in. At times, there were times I felt attention was take away from the exceptional writing because of pictures randomly placed in the middle of pages.I really loved the characters in Under My Skin. They were definitely my favorite aspect of the novel. Brit was a quirky, fun character who always provided a bit of fun to the scene. Alec was a big cutie. I really liked him. Eryn was a smart main character, which I really liked.The ending didn't fully provide answers, but it definitely intrigued me for the promise of book 2. I will be sure to pick up Second Skin, to hear more of these wonderful characters' story.

I loved how the beginning draws you in, Judith as delivered in a way that you can clearly imagine the story unfolding before your eyes. I also have to say usually my first concern is whether or not the continuation of a book will deliver just the same, as I continued to read on through the night I had a hard time wanting to put it down, you know when you were a kid and use to tell your parents just five more minutes? I found myself 40 minutes later still reading. I loved the characters in the book; they each have a unique personality, and found most of the plot refreshing. Mixing a bit of different paranormal beings into one book can be hard, because I had read a few where there have been a mix of paranormal beings but it doesn\u2019t feel as a whole, it feels as if many parts are clinging trying to connect and bring the story together, However Judith Graves does an amazing job of mixing the different aspects of the paranormal into this book. Though there is a bit of a love triangle in the story the plot doesn\u2019t focus on it, however I feel that love triangle will deepened in Judith\u2019s second book in the Skinned Series and look forward to seeing how this triangle develops.4/5 bats~Marie"}, {"userName": "Michelle Randall", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4868334-michelle-randall", "userReview": "Reviewed for Readers FavoriteHer parents wanted her to have a normal life, but Eryn had no idea what normal was.

Eryn is sure she just saw a werewolf, and as time goes by she finds herself knee deep in a whole lot of paranormal and caught between resident bad-boy Alex and town hottie Wade. These boys are most certainly Under My Skin (Skinned Book 1). Eryn is going to have to decide which side she is on, and who is hiding the most from her. Judith Graves writes a coming of age, doing it on your own, who is telling the truth story.Under My Skin, is paranormal, so you get the werewolves, vampires, wolven, and werewolf hunters. Then you have a Council that rules the paranormal community, and those who no longer respect the Council. So not only do you have the teenage story of the two guys after Eryn, you have the paranormal aspect, then there is a third more adult layer that makes this book wonderful for all ages.

It was surprising how the author was able to slip in the very creative sense of humor that she has. Also I was happy to see that this was not another vampire vs werewolf deal ( I had personally grown tired of that). But the fact the she acknowledged both lore; the gory disgusting SciFi werewolf and the skin changing werewolf (wolven in this case) was a welcome change.
