What I love so much about MZ\u2019s books is that they\u2019re long, but they don\u2019t feel long. I flew through this long book in a day and a half. Dear Aaron has MZ\u2019s signature slow burn quality, but it was a little different to me. Aaron and Ruby start out as friends, or pen-pals to be exact. They don\u2019t have the animosity and \u2018rub\u2019 to start with. The first 40% of the book was a mostly letters, emails, and IM\u2019s. I liked that the characters got to know each other this way. I wouldn\u2019t call the first half slow, but the last 40-50% was sooooo much faster. I loved Aaron so much. I loved how Ruby\u2019s letters and messages got him through such a hard time in his life. It was almost strange to read a hero in a Zapata book that wasn\u2019t a grouch LOL! Ruby had some insecurities, but I adored her as well. It was apparent to me that these two were made for each other. I rooted for them. I wanted more of them \u2018together\u2019. I guess that\u2019s the only reason this wasn\u2019t a 5 for me. As much as I loved the emails, letters etc, I wish it was only 25% of the book or so. More Ruron time ;) \u2028\u2028Mariana Zapata is such a talented writer. Her books have this way of sucking me in. I adored this couple and their story.

She is hands down one of my all time favorite authors. Her last three books have all been amazing and 5 star reviews. I love her unique style, the slow burn, and all of her books have been devour-in-one-sitting kind of books. I think what makes her books so unique is her way of writing about real people and her characters are so easy to connect with. I\u2019ve known since the author announced it on FB that this book would be different. I didn\u2019t know exactly how different it would be but I\u2019ve read pen pal books before, so I had an inkling of what was to come. In Dear Aaron, the exchange of letters and emails, and later on the messaging between Ruby and Aaron lasted almost 40% of the book. I think all of us Slow Burners know what to expect when we read a Mariana Zapata book, but still, I don\u2019t think I was quite prepared for that long of an exchange.The letters between Ruby and Aaron were super sweet. Starting out as strangers they slowly and gradually worked their way to being friends. Throughout their conversations they got to know each other by sharing tidbits of their daily lives, family, hopes, fears and doubts. When they started messaging it became clear that they really liked each other. Their exchange, banter and jokes were wonderfully poignant and deeply touching.Ruby was such an interesting character. Sassy but also insecure at times. Hardworking and deeply loyal to family. Her fears and worries about the future were mirrored by Aaron\u2019s trepidation about what to do when he was done with the army. He became a soldier because there was nothing that interested him right after high school. Even though he never regretted that decision neither Aaron nor Ruby had everything planned out or knew what to do with their lives. It felt unapologetically real. How many young people don\u2019t know what to do with their lives. I\u2019ve been there once. \ud83d\ude00I\u2019ve always loved the authors skill of waving captivating and emotional stories about regular folks. People like you and me. Nobody extraordinary, just next door kind of people.And let\u2019s not forget the supporting characters. I adored Ruby\u2019s family. Especially her mother. She sounded like a woman to be feared but also someone that was a hoot in a crazy kind of way. It was easy to picture her thanks to Zapata\u2019s incredible skill of writing unique characters.That being said, I really enjoyed Dear Aaron.Was it as good as Wait For It or Wall of Winnipeg or Kulti? NOIt was sweet, but it wasn\u2019t the same fleshed out and captivating novel I\u2019m used to. For me unfortunately, letters never work as well as regular plotted storylines. There can only be so much explained and described in letters. And whereas texting and messaging can be cute and funny, it\u2019s not the same as a regular dialogue.I truly admire the author for writing something different. She stepped outside the molt and delivered a unique concept and plot. It just didn\u2019t work for me as well as I hoped it would.Nevertheless, I love her style of writing and Dear Aaron was without a doubt an entertaining book that I finished in one sitting. I just wanted it to be a bit more amazing and special. But I also acknowledge that the first 40% just didn't connect with me as much as regular chapters would have. Nevertheless her writing was excellent and it's a Zapata book - so it will never be anything else than remarkable.

When Ruby signed up to a soldier pen pal program, she gets paired up with a guy named Aaron. What starts out as puns, movie and gaming talks turn into so much more as Ruby and Aaron become comfortable with each other. They tell each other things they\u2019ve never told anybody else, and they tell each other things without fear of being judged. When they have the chance to finally meet, Ruby does something completely out of her comfort zone and flies to Florida to meet the man who\u2019s become her best friend and the love of her life.As I\u2019ve mentioned in my book review for Dear Aaron, while this has the same air to Mariana\u2019s previous works, DA shows us a heroine different from the rest of her leads and tells part of the story through letters and emails. I loved listening to the progress of Aaron and Ruby\u2019s relationship, and I loved the little moments between them.Full Review HereWHAT DID YOU LIKE ABOUT THE AUDIOBOOK?It made me see\u2014rather, hear\u2014the book in a new perspective. As you can see, I gave Dear Aaron a higher story review here than in the previous review I gave for the book. Listening to the audiobook made me appreciate things I didn\u2019t when I first read the book a few months ago. I loved listening to Ruby and Aaron\u2019s online conversations, but I loved it even more when they finally met. Cuddly Aaron. Affectionate Aaron. Attentive Aaron. I\u2019m so happy!It made me feel giddy and happy listening to them chat back and forth. Teddy Hamilton was the perfect Aaron with his subtle twang and his warm and friendly voice. I could hear the affection and feelings through their exchanges. And Callie was fantastic as always. I could hear the fear, uncertainty, joy, and love in her voice.Most importantly, this audiobook made me appreciate and empathize with Ruby even more. I\u2019ve always loved that girl, and now I love her even more.HOW WOULD YOU DESCRIBE THE EXPERIENCE OF LISTENING TO DEAR AARON?It\u2019s new and something I absolutely enjoyed. The rest of Mariana Zapata\u2019s audiobooks were purely told in a female POV and all by Callie Dalton, so to have a new voice in the mix is a welcome addition. And it helps that it\u2019s Teddy Hamilton.WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THIS AUDIOBOOK TO A FRIEND? IF SO, WHY?Yes! I spent my twelve hours wisely with this one. With MZ\u2019s signature slow burn, cute banter, and realistic characters, it\u2019s a treat. Plus, Teddy Hamilton and Callie Dalton had great chemistry as Aaron and Ruby, and I loved listening to them.Tropes: Friends to Lovers, Military Hero, Pen PalsPOV: Epistolary\u2014Dual, First POV; First, Female POVStandalone: Yes  Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram"}, {"userName": "Aisling Zena", "userReviewDate": "Jul 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18444439-aisling-zena", "userReview": "[I wanted to know who moved where.

Full confession, I totally went into this book knowing mini spoilers. By that I mean I knew the majority of the first half of the book was in epistolary form aka written in emails, IMs and texts. I think it helped knowing that going in, because if I hadn't I think I would have quit this book, and that would be a damn shame. Dear Aaron is a love story between a soldier and his assigned pen pal. Ruby and Aaron meet via email when he is deployed in the Middle East through a letters to soldiers program. Over time, they become very good friends and some feelings develop, at least on one side.I really don't want to say more than that, go into this knowing it's a slow burn, the first half the interactions are all written, and that it's a long book and you'll be good. Mariana Zapata writes the best slow burn romance. Hands down. You want a romance you'll long for? Turn to this woman's books. And while this one was on the sweeter side for me, I still found myself smiling as I was reading it.This book was really a double edged sword for Zapata, and by that I mean the way it's written is a tough balance. Too much written interaction and it's too long, not enough and then people would complain it's not developed enough. While it's not perfect, I think she did an excellent job in building the relationship she did and that many readers will enjoy it.I'm off to read the rest of Zapata's books! I have two more to go until I run out and will sit here waiting for her to publish more!Follow me on \u2665 Facebook \u2665 Blog \u2665 Instagram \u2665 Twitter \u2665"}, {"userName": "Leila bibliofagos", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39901038-leila-bibliofagos", "userReview": "Review before reading the book:Oh my god.Did you guys know???That this was happening???New book from Mariana Zapata?Can I have this now, please?Review after reading Dear Aaron:I'll try to be nice because... Mariana Zapata. Now, I'm sure you know how much I love her previous works 'Kulti' and 'Winnipegg'. The characters are intricate and layered. Their problems are multifaceted and in general the slow burn romance was believable and to die for. Not only that but, the female characters were strong in their own right and also vulnerable (because you can't only be strong. you have to be atleast sometimes vulnerable).I gave this book a real chance. No BS I swear. I started this book and read every single sentence (however boring) up to chapter 8, where I realized that things were not going to be better, that I would NOT care about what they wrote about and I would definitely NOT laugh about all the toilet jokes (cue eye roll).Now here we have two characters. Ruby and Aaron. Ruby is...how should I describe her? She is 23 years old, a seamstress and she works for her Aunt or Aunts (I don't really remember). She likes to cry A LOT. She has never had a boyfriend and she has a major inferiority complex because the boy she was in love with for so long never liked her back. I'm not a bad person. Some might call me even compassionate! *cough cough* However, Ruby did not endear me in anyway to her predicament. Mostly because she spoke like a fourteen year old girl. A teenager who doesn't know anything, really. I get that it's 2008 when she starts writing to Aaron, but the internet existed then, did it not? Women in 2009 acted quite a bit like today did they not?The fact that a man she went on one date with and wanted to have sex with her, should not be considered such a bad thing, right? She acted so astonished by him...like how could he? Girl you crazay. Ruby acts like this is some sort of mistreatment. Whines about it to Aaron and says she couldn't believe he did that. I'm sorry, am I missing something here? Did men eight years ago, not want to have sex on the first date? Also, if a woman does have sex on the first date, is she considered a whore in our heroine's eyes? That kind of pissed me off. So naive...such a blatant push-over. And not in a charming way, in a I'm-so-quirky-and-young-I-don't-know-anything-of-vital-importance way. So cutesy I wanna throw up.But since I'm compassionate and nice I won't use the real vocab I thought when reading this story. Spoiler alert, they were bad words.Also, just a side note: our heroine used the word idiot when referring to herself and/or her actions. I always sided with her when she would say that, no matter what Aaron made her believe later.Let's start with Aaron now, shall we? Hmmm... Aaron is a 30 yo soldier who is...a man, who likes to read but not a lot. A man who likes cheesy jokes...a man who wants pizza...a man who-Sorry. Fell asleep there for a second.But yeah, that's basically it. That's right. No personality. I mean literally zero, zilch, nada, \u03c4\u03af\u03c0\u03bf\u03c4\u03b1...He has some family issues. He thinks talking about pooping and peeing is funny (although our heroine is even worse than he is-seriously though what is up with all the toilet talk?) and he has a dog back home or something. Oh and he used to have a girlfriend. Now, I understand that the author was kind of going for the strong silent type. But see now, that can't really work because of the books format! Half of the book is written in email, letter or IM format. With no written text telling us the characters feelings or actions or anything in between said correspondence. It's like reading some strangers' facebook messages. And they aren't even that interesting.So yeah, after that we meet Aaron when he practically begs said heroine to meet up with him. She of course declines at first because she has issues or whatever (I really couldn't care less) but in the end she goes because if she didn't there would be no book to read in the first place. Now from here on out the novel is written normally, with paragraphs and actual dialogue and actions.Even together though they were boring! As in, I just couldn't get into the book. The writing felt choppy. I didn't understand Ruby's train of thought all that well, because we had missed a large part of character development with all the emails and IMing. I didn't feel investing in either characters. Also, a major downer was the fact that I hated, HATED Ruby's internal voice. Such low self esteem. So much doubt. Such juvenile behavior. What is this? A middle school book?In the past I have read books by other authors that have made this sort of email, text, diary thing work. Most prominent has to be Meg Cabot. She has written several books that have a diary format (duh) and emailing/texting format. Yet, she has made it work! I have enjoyed her books because they make me understand the characters. Here unfortunately it didn't. At all. I'm disappointed. And really I just want to read 'Winnipegg' again. You know what? That's what I'm gonna do. So yeah. I guess I'm sorry. I'm sorry because I love Mariana Zapata. I'm sorry if this is ranty. I'm sorry if I didn't get the book. I tried. I did. I just hated it though."}, {"userName": "Angie - Angie's Dreamy Reads", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8524618-angie---angie-s-dreamy-reads", "userReview": "So .. here's the thing, I'm not going to do a huge review. I'm just going to jot down a few random thoughts on this book because I don't know what to rate it. I wouldn't consider this a huge spoiler review, however, I don't like knowing ANYTHING about a book before I go into it, and if this were me reading this review, I would say LIGHT SPOILER ALERT in paragraph 2! OK? Okay! Firstly, this was my first Mariana Zapata read and I. FREAKING. LOVED. THESE. CHARACTERS. I really want to give this book five stars because the second half of this novel ran away with my heart. I couldn't stop reading. I just could not stop reading this story and I ate up Mariana's writing. It was breathtaking. I felt everything these characters were feeling. My heart raced, my chest ached, my eyes bled tears, I was just in it. I loved the pacing of this book. Sure it was a slow burn but in that second half it just felt like an organic unfolding of the sweetest romance. And was wow. That said, my biggest issue with this book is that I wanted to DNF in the first half. :::cries sadly::: I literally had to force myself NOT TO GIVE UP. I did not love the first half of Dear Aaron, and here's why. The letters and the IM's were a good, cute idea and I liked they way the author used those to give the readers information on the characters, to grow Ruby and Aaron's friendship, but it was too much, too long, and after awhile it felt tedious and never ending. I got to a point where I was just desperate to SEE these characters, not just read what was going on in their notes. I felt as if it was void of any and all emotion. And I, personally, felt nothing. Nothing at all. It took forever for me to feel a flutter of affection toward Aaron and Ruby. And because almost half of the book is the letters and the instant messages it was a struggle for me to continue. THAT SAID (again, lol), once I hit the halfway point, this novel CAME ALIVE for me. I was so lost in the words. So lost in the characters. So utterly lost in the story. I felt like I lived and breathed these two characters. I certainly never wanted it to end. And I was so so so so so happy that I didn't give up. That I pushed on. I cried for these two, they are the sweetest thing together. And I loved their friendship. I loved the way they reacted to each other. I loved the dialogue. I loved their chemistry. I loved the progression of them as friends to lovers. It was EVERYTHING. ALL THE THINGS in that second half. So... I don't know. What do you rate it? Certainly 5 stars for the 2nd half and I give it like 2.5-3 for the first half. So..... LMAO! Can we just average it out to like FIVE STARS because..THAT.SECOND. FUCKING. HALF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Ahhhhhhh! I can't get over it. All I gotta say is this, I AM SO HAPPY I READ AND FINISHED. I would never have wanted to miss out on the sweetness that is Aaron and Ruby. My heart is so full this morning. SO FULL OF HAPPY. And I have a book hangover. So... idk, you guys. I most certainly recommend Dear Aaron. 100 percent. It's sweet and funny and heartwarming, and I LOVED that second half. I really did. So **shrugs** I just say READ THE BOOK."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3283298-jessica", "userReview": "2.5 starsAh well, this didn\u2019t go as planned. I know that Zapata\u2019s books are slow slow sloooow burn romance but in this case the overall pace was just too slow for me. The first part of the novel is entirely written in an email style format, which was fine in the beginning, but by the time the 25% mark had rolled around, I was starting to grow quite bored. I\u2019ve seen this working in other novels, you know, where you manage to fall in love with the couple and swoon over the guy just because of their online conversations, but the difference is - that unlike here - you usually get a regular kind of novel style in between those electronic conversations. That wasn\u2019t the case here so I constantly found myself wondering when the real story would finally start and I struggled to really connect with the characters. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a spoiler if I tell you that you have to wait until the 45% mark for the format to change, which is really damn long. When the switch came, I was kinda thrown off at first but at least things did pick up a little after that. Still, Zapata just has this way of describing the most boring, mundane things in excruciating detail, so even though I did like the second half better, it was still too slow.If I could take a pair of scissors to this book and snip snip snip away a couple of chapters here and a couple of chapters there, I think I\u2019d end up with a decent end result. Honestly, had the emails been reduced by 50% I probably wouldn\u2019t have minded the slow pace all that much.Now another thing that was a bit difficult for me was the female MC Ruby. She was just so damn virginal and naive. If you know me and the kind of words I\u2019m usually throwing around in my reviews you probably get why I\u2019d struggle with a chick that can\u2019t even say dick pic.She just read really young and sheltered and wasn\u2019t the kind of MC I usually like in my romance reads.And Aaron...idk. I liked him but he came across as just a tiny bit controlling and condescending in a few situations, which I didn\u2019t appreciate. There was one situation in particular in which he really pissed me off, since he blamed Ruby and made her feel bad for something that wasn\u2019t her fault and that whole scene made me wonder a bit about the mindset of the person who wrote this.Anyway, the last 20% or so were more like 4 stars for me, because the fact remains that Zapata does know how to write romance that make your toes curl. I actually had goosebumps when I read their dance scene. I also don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever read such well written kiss scenes. Sadly, a perfect 20% in the end were not enough to make this a truly enjoyable read for me.There was one more thing that made me pause, which I don\u2019t consider a spoiler since we all know how these stories go, but I still wanted to put a little warning in here. So...maybe stop.Can someone, who\u2019s read the book, tell me if I overlooked something (because honestly, I started skimming a little towards the end) but have Aaron and Ruby ever talked about safe sex and whether Ruby was on the pill? Did I miss that conversation? Because if not, I found it kind of a questionable move on Aaron\u2019s part to just plunge his dingdong in there - bare - without even bringing up the topic of protection. I mean, the guy did have sex with quite a few people, they\u2019ve known each other irl for like a week, and considering how innocent Ruby was and the fact that she even told him that her mom never had the birds and bees talk with her, it kinda irked me that he would just do that. And is pulling out an approved method of contraception now? Cause the way Zapata wrote that (slightly clinically) sex scene, made it seem like it was the most normal thing in the world. Even in the raunchiest romance novels I\u2019ve read, safe sex was always a topic. And for the record, pulling out just doesn\u2019t cut it and it certainly doesn\u2019t protect you from STDs. Ok, this isn\u2019t a reason to dislike a book but I found it strange and it bugged me nonetheless.Whoops, this ended up being longer than I intended.**********************Buddy read with lucie \ud83c\udf3b"}, {"userName": "Amy (Foxy)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9955253-amy-foxy", "userReview": "Dear Ruby,My name is Foxy, and I\u2019m writing to you because I just finished reading your love story in Dear Aaron and wanted to let you know I, too, know what it\u2019s like to have a relationship built on personalities.

Today we are happily married with kids and fur babies to round out our family.Aaron won me over when he first met you and said, \u201cYou could\u2019ve told me your mom and sister are the ugly ones in the family.\u201d You were so insecure about your looks compared to the rest of your family and yet to Aaron he saw you as the most beautiful one in your family.

Unfortunately, Ruby isn\u2019t my favorite type of female to read about because her insecurities began to annoy me as time progressed. I wanted to love her because in some ways her story was parallel to mine (age wise, flying across the country to meet someone you\u2019ve only exchanged messages with, etc) but her constant unsureness of herself made me start to lose the warm fuzzy feelings towards her. The premise of this book is amazing; the first part of the book is told in emails, skype \u2026 basically the written word. I love books that incorporate emails, text, etc into the story. A lot of times peoples personality really shines through the written word. As with Ms. Zapata\u2019s book the slow burn romance is key to building a lasting relationship. The buildup to them both admitting to their feelings leaves a satisfying ending. Well sort of\u2026 I have no idea about the epilogue. I got a little lost in it. It left me questioning what was their current situation. Dear Aaron is a standalone slow burn romance told largely through emails. A soldier overseas receives a pen pal from the States that becomes more than just someone to share a joke or two with while he\u2019s deployed. \n Follow Foxy Blogs at: Blog \u2665 Twitter \u2665 Instagram \u2665 Facebook"}, {"userName": "Nanly", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19320521-nanly", "userReview": "[As much as I love Ruby - she is funny, goofy, and kind - it is really a pet peeve of mine when your insecurity issues make you turn every woman out there into your enemy.

It was a little frustrating to read the way she felt toward some of the women in this book simply because she felt threatened. And even though I have a lowkey highkey crush on Aaron, I really hated that this dude was so secretive and got upset over the smallest things - it drove me nuts.

I still haven\u2019t found a book by her that I don\u2019t absolutely love. She\u2019s the queen of the slow burn, and she\u2019s a master at it. Everything about it always feels so right, the purpose, the anticipation, the non gratuitous sex. It\u2019s just perfect!So, I kinda made the mistake of reading/listening to From Lukov With Love before reading Dear Aaron. I didn\u2019t know there was a connection between both. Now, I need to say that they\u2019re complete standalones so you don\u2019t have to read one to enjoy the other, but the heroines on both books are sisters and Lukov happens a few years after DA. So if you\u2019re super OCD like I am, I totally recommend you read Dear Aaron first. Needless to say, I loved every second of this book. The idea of these characters falling for each other by corresponding for months was so cool and refreshing! And the way is written, with the emails and chats and text was super clever. Everything about their relationship from strangers to friends to lovers was absolutely fantastic. And then everything about how they meet. Gahhh I\u2019m smiling and swooning hard! I was a little left wanting more though, I want more Ruron! Also, as with From Lukov, I simultaneously read the book and listened to the audiobook and let me tell you that is another fantastic performance by Callie Dalton and Teddy Hamilton! They are magic on the booth, although I wish Teddy would\u2019ve done all the male parts throughout (and not just on the communications) like he did on Lukov. Either way, it was amazing.

I love slow burn romances, I don't even mind extremely slow burn romances but Dear Aaron was way too slow and the romance between the characters was... weird.About the format - I absolutely hated the pen pal format. They were exchanging emails for first 120 or so pages and then messaging for another 100. I am not lying when I tell you that I rewarded myself with one episode of Friends every 50 read pages. Around middle of the book the normal novella format started and HALLELUJAH!I didn't feel connection with Aaron or Ruby. Ruby was pretty immature, naive and childish for her age. If I wouldnt know how old is she, I would guess 16 tops. She even got almost hysterical after she wrote him xoxo in one message. Aaron, on the other hand, acted like her parent. He was overprotective and not in the adorable way. They had few cute moments but I didn't have butterflies in my belly as usual have while reading Zapata's book, when they were together. No feels and no anticipation. I just wanted to read it as fast as possible so I can move on another book.

They get to know each other through the e-mails and later on chatting online. Marina Zapata builds up the characters through their letters to each other.

I devour these books in a day and the second I finish them, I want to start all over again. Ruby Santos is a twenty three year old seamstress, she has lived under the thumb of her family for years, being considered the \u2018baby\u2019 of the family and the fragile one. After her older brother comes back from the war, she signs up through the Help a Solider Foundation, wanting to support soldiers through their lonely time overseas. Ruby gets paired with Staff Sargent Aaron Hall, and when she receives no response to her numerous letters, she eventually decides to try and get him reassigned. Only for Aaron to finally write back. The two write, message and email for nine months before they meet, and I was totally in love with them after the first chapter.I was hesitant to go into this book when I found out a good portion (44% of the book to be precise) was written in an email format. I am not the biggest fan of books written in script form but I shouldn\u2019t have worried. I fell into the script and barely noticed the format, it was a clever way to introduce two characters without any physical bias, I went through the majority of the book not having a physical description and not giving a damn. I grew to love their quirky personalities and the budding relationship that grew between the characters, the awkward stories and cheesy jokes were the highlight. Mariana Zapata\u2019s female main characters are always normal, hardworking women (a seamstress in this case) and her men are devoted and gruff with everybody but their leading lady. I mean, if you need anymore convincing, Aaron was a Buffy fan. My only complaint was that every time I read the name Aaron I thought of this lmfaoI loved every moment of this book, I couldn\u2019t get enough of their story and although it was not my favourite of MZ\u2019s books, I won\u2019t hesitate to reread it sometimes (soon)."}, {"userName": "Stacey is Sassy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12062194-stacey-is-sassy", "userReview": "Some people move on from mistakes quicker than others.OK, we all know that I\u2019m a romantic at heart. Luckily for me, I found my own romantic hero pretty early in life. It\u2019s a bloody good thing, to be honest. My lifestyle could have killed me. I\u2019m not talking drugs\u2026because drugs are bad\u2026OK (I can still hear the teacher from Southpark saying it). I was a little reckless when it came to drinking and letting my inhibitions go. Every time I woke up after a big night, I regretted it. Did I embarrass myself? What time did I get in? Do I have any money left? Who was watching? What I was doing was dangerous. At the time, I was ashamed and thought everyone knew\u2026everyone judged me\u2026everyone pitied me. It's worse when you do something really embarrassing in front of everyone...and you have to face the repercussions over and over and over again.I really understood Ruby. Not every woman is strong and independent. Some women find it hard to stand up for themselves. There\u2019s even quite a few women who find it easier to be sheltered than take a risk. This does not mean she\u2019s weak or that she\u2019s incapable of being strong. What this means is that she\u2019s not a fan of confrontation. Sometimes it\u2019s easier to go along with something that someone else feels passionate about, because to you, it\u2019s not EVERYTHING. It\u2019s easier to believe the negative comments than the positive ones. If you\u2019re surrounded by strong, feisty and beautiful women, it\u2019s easy to forget that you might not look the same, but you have your own type of beauty.Ruby\u2026was a lot like me.The other part of Ruby that I REALLY got was her having lived through a health complication. You don\u2019t ask for it, but all of a sudden, your family starts treating you like a kid again\u2026and it never ends. For years my family tiptoed around me and worried about every decision I made. Unlike Ruby, I pushed those boundaries every chance I got. I wanted to scream\u2026I\u2019M ALIVE!! I just was a wee bit overzealous testing it.Now, maturity and motherhood have changed me a lot. How can I teach my kids to be strong if I don't set them a good example? Sure, I still pick my battles, but now, I can battle with the best of them.For me, this story should have been called Dear Ruby. I really think this read a little like Women\u2019s Fiction instead of Romance. Now, Women's Fiction is new to me, but from what I know, WF is all about relationships, growing and coming to realise your inner strengths and weaknesses. Aaron was just a part of Ruby\u2019s journey to happiness. Oh, I loved Aaron and thought he was an awesome hero. I really felt like I needed to know him more, though, to say that this story was based on their relationship.This is Mariana Zapata at her slow burn finest. I thought she was actually going to leave the sexy shenanigans out completely\u2026SHOCK HORROR!! We do get a wee glimpse, but it\u2019s a quick blink and you\u2019ll miss it glimpse.I loved it\u2026BUT\u2026The messages went too long at the beginning. The second half of the book was great but I really didn\u2019t feel like I had seen the couple together long enough. The Epilogue was a little confusing and it was a little unclear where they were at. I needed a little more dialogue from Aaron to understand him better. I also felt like there were characters that I needed to know a little more about. For such a long book, the ending felt rushed.In one of my updates, I mentioned that I think Dear Aaron would be an AWESOME movie. I want to see the characters, their pets, the costumes Ruby designed and the desert Aaron was living in. Mariana Zapata is one of my favourite authors and I will definitely keep going back for more.

It was an unconventional start to their friendship but it's one that grew stronger as each mail, IM, and care package was exchanged and delivered. Their correspondence goes on even after the end of Aaron\u2019s tour, and without even noticing it, they\u2019ve become each other\u2019s best friend\u2014maybe even more for Ruby.How is Dear Aaron different from her other works? Ms. Zapata wrote part of the book in an epistolary voice\u2014letters, e-mails, instant and text messages. I know some people don\u2019t enjoy a book without the usual narrative style, but I think it helped readers get a glimpse of what goes on in both characters\u2019 lives and see the gradual build of their friendship and feelings. Like her other books, the rest of the story is told in the female lead\u2019s point of view.It was a slow start, but as soon as the pace picked up halfway through, I had a perma-grin \u2019til the very last page (Mariana, I want to frame the acknowledgment!). That first meeting made me squeal and giggle and ahhhh. I loved how their easy banter and ease around each other translated outside IMs and emails, and damn it, Aaron was so sweet!!! He was so thoughtful and caring and ahhhhhhh\nYou're the best, and you deserve better than me, but I hope you don't care.\"\nHe\u2019s no grumpy hero like Aiden and Kulti, but there are times Aaron gets stuck inside his head. With his complicated family life and experiences as a soldier, he\u2019s learned to hide how he feels and what he thinks, so it takes a while for Ruby to break down his walls.I love how the author writes about regular people we can all relate/once related to. People who don\u2019t have their sh*t figured out all the time. Ruby is in her early twenties and she\u2019s still trying to find out what she\u2019s supposed to do with her life, and it freaks her out most of the time. Honestly, I\u2019m just like her right now. Twenty-three and still clueless. I want to cry just thinking about it haha.Aaron had his own worries\u2014whether he should go on another tour or stay in the States and do who knows what.It was a hoot reading their conversations and mail exchange! I know parents warn their kids about talking to strangers and making friends on the internet, but some of my most cherished friendships started over the internet. Just like Ruby and Aaron, I didn\u2019t physically meet some of my really good friends until way later. I\u2019ve known friends who fell in love with their partners before they met face-to-face and let me tell you, they\u2019re still happily married and in love. I had no doubt Ruby and Aaron could be like that, too.I would have wanted a few more scenes after they got together, and to see more of the subplot about Aaron's family. That part felt abruptly cut off somewhere near the end. Overall, I still enjoyed the story.Dear Aaron was sweet, refreshing, and heartwarming. It had its fair share of drama and angst, but most of the story is light and cute. If Wait for It made you cry, Dear Aaron will make you smile, laugh, and giggle like a school girl.This story also made me think about our brothers going away to keep us safe, and made me wonder what life is like for them while they\u2019re miles away and their safety isn\u2019t always guaranteed.And I don\u2019t know about you guys, but I really want to read about Ruby\u2019s sister, Jazz. Ice skating romance, anyone???P.S. Is there a real program like Help a Soldier? Because honestly, I want to sign up. No, I\u2019m not doing it because I want my own romance, but I want to do something to help. Even if it\u2019s just a letter or mail, I want to do something.Tropes: Friends to Lovers, Military Hero, Pen PalsPOV: Epistolary\u2014Dual, First POV; First, Female POVStandalone: Yes  Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram"}, {"userName": "Mare SLiTsReaD Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7854185-mare-slitsread-reviews", "userReview": "Loved.

So did a lot of us! It took me a little bit longer to read this. Not necessarily a bad thing. I try not to skim. There is a lot of dialogue (or text). The first 40% or so is all email then IM between Aaron & Ruby. I really enjoyed this part of it. There's a lot of mundane details. They \"talked\" about all kinds of stuff. It was like a journal, but getting a response from a friend. I wrote in a journal when I was in High School.I also wrote pen pals. One was a guy from my neighborhood. He was a punk when we were younger. He joined the Marines. I really enjoyed writing to him-just as a friend. In this story, Ruby is 23 y/o and very immature in many ways. She's the first to admit it. She's been sheltered her whole life. She's determined to break out of her label \"squirt\". Even her younger sister calls her that. Ruby has a close family, but they have been smothering her and not really encouraging her to grow. I love how Ruby and Aaron message back and forth. Ruby has written a service man before, but this time it's different. She starting to feel something different for Aaron. She's had her hopes up and then her heart broken from a crush on a family friend. It was a couple of years before, but she's still smarting from the rejection. After the 40%-44% mark, the POV is just Ruby. What does Aaron feel for her? I enjoyed the transition to dialogue and narrative. What was going to happen when Ruby & Aaron meet? The plot did still include a lot of mundane details. It did slow down quite a bit for me. I was caught up in Ruby and Aaron. Ruby is not unlike a lot of real life early 20s girls- and even some guys. I talk to them at work all day long. I got married when I was 23 and we bought a condo the following year. I thought that I was an emotional wimpy young girl. I know what it's like to take the big steps that Ruby tries to take. Ruby seems stunted. maturity wise, she's way behind young women her age. There a few supporting roles with young women that seem light night and day compared to Ruby. In Dear Aaron, Ruby is taking baby steps, but she's really trying to grow up. A Kick Ass heroine she's not. I could tell that Aaron is physically attracted to her. But they already \"knew\" each other from letting it all hang out in their IM and emails. Aaron is very patient with Ruby. Ruby's thinking he's got her friend-zoned. She doesn't want that one-sided infatuation again. Or is it love. Real love?I read some reviews that said Aaron seemed cold. Not at all, in my opinion. He is very sweet to Ruby. He's very protective of her. He knows that she inexperienced. I enjoyed the ending much more than I thought I would. I'm giving 4 stars. This is my 2nd MZ book. I want to read more from this author.
