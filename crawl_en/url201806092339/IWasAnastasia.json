Most have also heard of the woman (Anna Anderson) who claimed for years to be Anastasia Romanov and that she survived the brutal attack that claimed the lives of her family and servants. This is a clever telling of that story. The question about what whether Anastasia Romanov survived the firing squad in the basement has fascinated people for decades. Lack of DNA testing and location of a grave/burial site helped many who stepped forward to claim that she was the sole survivor. Of course, through the passing of time, DNA testing has been conducted and grave site excavations have given a clear answer.But as the saying goes...it's not the destination, it's the journey. Lawhon takes the reader on a unique journey using two story lines. While reading this book, readers will either enjoy or become annoyed by the storytelling. While Anastasia Romanov's story is told chronologically, the story of Anna Anderson is told in reverse. In Author's note, Ariel Lawhon states that the movie \"Memento\" is a favorite of hers. This style of writing also reminded me of the book \"All the missing girls\" which was also told in reverse.I found that I rather liked how she told her story. The storytelling was unique, granted, it did take me a couple of chapters to wrap my head around it. Thankfully, the chapters are labeled with the time you are reading. That is a big help! There is a lot of historical detail in this book. It is evident that the Author did a great deal of research prior to the writing of this book. History buffs may detect that Lawhon blended several characters into one (i.e. had one character be a blending of 2 real life guards of the Romanov's) in order to help the reader keep track of events and not be weighed down by too many characters. It is hard to say too much without giving away spoilers, but this work of historical fiction was very good. I really appreciated how she blended historical facts with fiction. If you do not know the entire history about the Romanov's family's fall from grace and the events leading up to their execution, it is laid out for you here. I highly recommend reading the Author's note at the end. I think this is essential. She details her research, why she blended characters, her inspiration for the reverse story telling and what lead her to write this book. I was actually deciding between a 3.5 and a 4 star rating, and then I read the Author's note and that pushed the book to a 4 star rating for me.I love when books cause me to think, feel and also to learn. I did learn some facts while reading this book and I found I often wanted to put the book down and think about what I had just read. Mainly because things in this book really happened. Sitting and thinking about the horrible treatment of this family (especially the girls) and what they endured -living in constant fear and dread, I can't even imagine. Again, interesting story-telling and a compelling read. Thank you to Doubleday books and NetGalley for providing me with an advanced readers copy of this book.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "I am Anastasia by Ariel Lawhon is a 2018 Doubleday publication. No matter how many movies, documentaries, or books I\u2019ve watched or read, the romantic in me simply can\u2019t resist the fascination and the mystery of Anastasia Romanov. This book examines the life of Anna Anderson, who claimed she was Anastasia, while also chronicling the period of time the Romanov\u2019s were in exile, leading up to their execution during the Bolshevik Revolution. Anna\u2019s claims captured our imaginations for decades and sparked many debates over the legitimacy of her pronouncement. While she was often met with skepticism, she also had many staunch supporters. I, for one, always loved the notion surrounding this legend. I hoped, no matter how far-fetched or doubtful the probability, that Anna Anderson really was Anastasia Romanov. If a miracle did happen, and Anastasia somehow managed to survive, we could all rationalize our fascination with the Czar\u2019s daughter, from Ingrid Bergman\u2019s oscar winning portrayal, to the animated Disney film, and all points in between. But, of course, the reality is far more serious and grim.This novel is obviously a very ambitious undertaking. Giving voice to Anastasia, and Anna Anderson, describing minute historical details, adding authentic and vivid dialogue, along with solid pacing, and well-drawn characterizations. This story is very interesting, and the author certainly did her homework, doing a great job of laying out Anna\u2019s complexities. Anna was difficult, but also lived with a host of mental issues, making her a sympathetic figure on occasion, which left me with conflicting emotions. I often wondered how other people who have read this book felt about her in the end. However, I must address the elephant in the room when it comes to the way the author structured the novel. She explains the method to her madness in a note at the end of the book, and it does make sense, from the viewpoint of the writer, and logically, I see where she\u2019s coming from. However, the backwards/forwards, first and third person narratives made the book more difficult to read than need be, in my opinion. I did struggle with the format, I must say. However, others may not be bothered by it at all, and may even benefit from it. I\u2019m not always the sharpest tool in the shed, so there is that. However, I did agree with the concept of separating \u2018Anastasia\u2019 from \u2018Anna\u2019, but I did wish for a more traditional type of dual timeline, without all that skipping around. The novel\u2019s strongest area is the pacing and the agonizingly taut build -up of suspense. We must watch with mounting dread as the Romanov\u2019s are taken to Siberia, the clock ticking away as they careen towards their ultimate, tragic fate. This part of the story is interwoven with Anna\u2019s as she sits in a German court waiting on their decision, hoping she will at long last lay legitimate and official claim to the name \u2018Anastasia Romanov\u2019. The theories mapped out here are very imaginative, plausible, realistic and thought provoking. I can tell the author put a great deal of thought and time into this novel, which is much appreciated. Although it took me a long time to get through the book, really struggling with it at times, ultimately, I found it to be quite interesting and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t give up on it. One point I think we can all agree on, no matter what, is that Anna\u2019s claims turned Anastasia Romanov into a legend, taking on a life of its own. If not for her, Anastasia and her sisters would most likely have long been forgotten over time, along with other royal families who were met with the same fate. Just a little something to ponder over- I do recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Romanov history, of course, but be prepared- this is not a fairy tale! I would also recommend this book to anyone who enjoys historical fiction in general. This book will most likely spark your curiosity about the Romanov family and you will want to learn more about this them, and the events leading up to their capture, exile, and murders. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Crumb", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/53025065-crumb", "userReview": "This book, for me, was mediocre. The history behind this story was fascinating, but the way the story was executed, was ill-conceived. There were two alternating story lines that were asynchronous to one another, which made for a pretty confusing reading experience. However, with all that being said, I still really enjoyed the story and the history. This novel chronicled the final days of the Romanov family, shining a light on Anastasia. Did she die in Ekaterinburg with the rest of her family or didn't she? That is what the author wants the reader to decide. The other story follows a woman claiming to be Anastasia, who goes by Anna Anderson. If you are interested in Russian history, I definitely think you would like this book. I liked the story..I did. I just thought it could have been better. Written better. Told better..Like Shania Twain says.. \"That Don't Impress Me Much\""}, {"userName": "Jennifer ~ TarHeelReader & Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32340179-jennifer-tarheelreader-traveling-sister", "userReview": "4 engrossing stars to I Was Anastasia! \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f \u2b50\ufe0f Being approved to read an early copy of I Was Anastasia was like winning the lottery to this historical fiction fan. Not only because of my love for the genre, but also because of my interest in Anastasia. Not because she was a princess necessarily, but because growing up I remember discussions about Anna Anderson and if she was or was not the real Anastasia Romanov. Ariel Lawhon ambitiously tackles this notion in a genius structure through writing from two viewpoints in different timelines, Anastasia\u2019s in forward-progression, and Anna\u2019s in reverse. In the Author\u2019s Note, Lawhon describes that it was challenging to write this way, and I kept thinking that as I read. She even read biographies of Anna Anderson in reverse order so that she would formulate it in her head the way she would eventually write Anna\u2019s voice. It would have been easier to write in linear form, and perhaps easier for the reader to follow; but I enjoyed this convergence in storylines. It built the suspense for me. Even though I already knew the true outcome, I longed for a different one as I quickly read through this book waiting for the timelines to intersect, waiting for the answer Lawhon would write. Reading the Author\u2019s Note also inspired me to dig deeper into Romanov history. I have a nonfiction book she cited as a reference, The Romanov Sisters: The Lost Lives of the Daughters of Nicholas and Alexandra, and plan to read it soon to learn more.

It\u2019s an effective introduction to the bizarre controversy surrounding two historical people. My experience was a bit different. As others have mentioned, Anastasia\u2019s story is told chronologically while Anna\u2019s story is told in reverse order. Given that this is well worn material, I understand that the author chose this structure for dramatic effect. However, I found it to be a contrivance that was more annoying than dramatic. Characters carry on conversations and you don\u2019t find out until one or more chapters afterwards who some of these characters are which blurs the meaning of the initial conversations. And then there are the characterizations which left me cold and I mean the kind of frigidity that one would find in, say, Siberia. Granted, I was Anastasia is about the Anastasia/Anna dispute but I have read other historical fiction that has handled the questions surrounding the violent tragedy of July 1917 deftly. If upon reading this book you find that you are interested in the Romanov Dynasty, I would recommend anything written by Robert K. Massie. His narrative biographies are accessible and thorough providing the socio-political background necessary to understand why events happened as they did. Not a bad read but it didn't make me want to do cartwheels either."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "3.5 I am fairly familiar with the last days of the Romanovs, having read a few non fiction books about the subject. The woman who appears and tries to prove that she is a Romanovs daughter Anastasia, I was less familiar. In alternating chapters we follow both stories. The one of the Romanovs imprisonmrnt and eventually murder is written in a linear timeline, the story of Anna is told backwards in time, even within the same Chapter, we go backwards.I did like learning more about the girls personalities, though of course the focus is on Anastasia. They went through some terrible things, even more so because they had such a protected upbringing. Quite heartbreaking that the children were blamed for their parents mistakes. The part with Anna was also told well, but I found because of the way it was written, sometimes confusing.A great deal of research went into this novel, and the author explains in her authors note what that entailed and what she changed to make the story flow better. She also explains why she wrote it the way she did. I enjoyed this for the most part, but though I read why she wrote it this way, I still found myself liking those sections less."}, {"userName": "Angela M", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4685500-angela-m", "userReview": "[ Even though I knew the story of The Romanovs and their fate, I knew very little about Anna Anderson who for decades claimed to be Anastasia Romanov and worked to prove that she survived the firing squad that took the lives of Tsar Nicholas II and his family. I was pulled in at the beginning, but my interest in Anna\u2019s story waned. Maybe it was because I knew the outcome even though I knew not much else about her. There are dual narratives - Anna\u2019s which moves backwards in time and Anastasia\u2019s in chronological order. In the author\u2019s note, Ariel Lawhon relates her attraction to Anna\u2019s story but it was the Anastasia chapters that captivated me. The imagined account of what it was like for the Romanov family in the time just before they are sent off to Siberia and their death was compelling. I was so taken by the family in spite of what history tells us about Tsar Nicholas II . Captivated enough that I now want to read more about the Romanovs. This time I\u2019ll try a non - fiction account. I was less taken with the Anna chapters and I found myself hurrying through those to get back to the Anastasia chapters. I did though find the backward telling an interesting mechanism. It took me a while to get used to it, but I liked the challenge in spite of my desire to get back to the Romanovs in 1917. Lawhon clarifies what she takes liberty with in the telling of the story, and I appreciate what appears to be a well researched account. 3 stars but an extra half for the intrigue that has me wanting to read more about the Romanovs. I received an advanced copy of this book from Doubleday Books through NetGalley.

So apparently is Ariel Lawhon, as she weaves together both those stories in her latest work of historical fiction: one, about the last tragic eighteen months of the Romanov family's lives told through the eyes of their youngest daughter and the second, about Anna Anderson who claimed to be Anastasia. Anna's story is told backwards chronologically--beginning with her last court case in 1970 and then regressing back through time (what happened before that, and before that and so on). Eventually the two stories come together and the reader sees why the author chose to tell her story in this manner. It worked for me. I know a few readers have said that they abandoned the book because of this frustrating chronological structure, which keeps the reader off balance, making it hard to grasp the plot and remember names and places. But my advice is to stick with it: it does get easier to understand and there's a payoff at the end. Ariel Lawhon has done some fine writing here. I thoroughly enjoyed spending time with both Annas!

But, if you haven't, then I suggest you google her and read up on her life. Anna Anderson's life was very interesting and it has btw been made into a movie with Ingrid Bergman and a miniseries with Amy Irving. I've seen both since I find the Romanov's a captivated subject.I was curious to see how of Ariel Lawhon would construct the story since much has happened since Anna Anderson died in 1984. Now I take for granted that you know all about that, but if you don't know, then I will spoil the story a bit. Or rather I will reveal some truth's that may or may not be included in this book. So, read on if you dare!Since Anna Anderson died in 1984 has two things happened, for one thing, has DNA showed that she was not Anastasia, and also the graves of the Romanov's family has been found with the bones of ALL the children. So, how do you write a book when this is well-known? Easy, you make the both Anna and Anastasia's stories so believable that you want it to be true.All through the book does Anastasia's story interlopes with Anna's. We get to follow Anastasia through the years in captivity while Anna's story we get from the end unto the beginning. And, Anna's chapters. It's like reading a book backward. But, it works. It's very different, but it works so well. It's like two cars moving towards each other and you know they will crash, but you can't stop them!I Was Anastasia is a great book.

When all seven bodies could not be accounted for, the rumors began, and a young woman became the vortex of decades of guesswork. Was Anna Anderson really Anastasia Romanov? Is it possible she survived the slaughter of 1918 only to have an attempted suicide thwarted when she was fished form a frigid canal? Is this woman fitting the basic description of Anastasia and carrying the scars of wounds inflicted by both bullets and blades more than an opportunist seeking fame, fortune and the family treasures? Is she a delusional lost soul clinging to a fantasy that would make her life so much more meaningful? Was she like a leopard trying to change its spots?Ariel Lawhon\u2019s I WAS ANASTASIA is a brilliantly complex and tumultuous tale of possibilities, with questions that can never be answered, of facts that are sketchy and suspect at best. One thing for sure, Ms. Lawhon\u2019s two-pronged tale is fascinating, intriguing and very hard to put down!Anastasia\u2019s final days are laid out in a linear fashion, from her life at the palace to her life in a foreboding Siberian home where her pampered family was forced to become common-folk, doing common labor to survive. Anastasia is presented as a strong young woman, adaptable to the circumstances of her family\u2019s new existence. Just reaching an age where young love can bloom, only to have her life stolen away.Anna\u2019s tale is much different as we meet an older Anna, still fighting to be recognized as Anastasia. Believers believed in her, or at least in her entertainment value. Benefactors were more than willing to champion her cause through court after court, continent after continent. We will see her life unfold in reverse until we reach the final truth of a woman who felt she deserved the life she was denied.Fabulous reading, dark, detailed, gritty and magnetic. Regardless of the outcome, regardless of what history has proven, Ms. Lawhon\u2019s version is spellbinding from start to finish and her treatment of each character reflects the chaos each one lived through, factual or manufactured.I received a complimentary ARC edition from Doubleday Books!Publisher: Doubleday (March 27, 2018)Publication Date: March 27, 2018Genre: Historical FictionPrint Length: 344 pagesAvailable from: Amazon | Barnes & NobleFor Reviews & More: http://tometender.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Ann Marie (Lit\u00b7Wit\u00b7Wine\u00b7Dine)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7447086-ann-marie-lit-wit-wine-dine", "userReview": "DNF'ing at page 93.

I discovered the novel while compiling The Morally Questionable Green Hat and made note of it as the premise reminded me Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna (1986). I was familiar with the history behind the novel, but I didn\u2019t have any real expectations when I picked it up and was more than a little surprised when the book proved almost impossible to put aside.Lawhon\u2019s style and tone captured my attention from the first line and refused to release its hold till the very end of the narrative. I hate to gush, but Lawhon\u2019s ability to convey genuine tension is nothing short of brilliant. I knew where this story was going, but I still felt real fear and desperation in the musings and movements of both her leads and loved how their emotions emanated so distinctly from the page.The drama of the story is enhanced by Lawhon's brazenly ambitious structuring of the narrative. Anastasia\u2019s chapters progress chronologically, but Anna\u2019s are inversed. The end result leaves the reader questioning if the two voices run parallel to one another or if they are in fact two parts of a singular whole. The finale itself is wonderful, but it should be understood that Lawhon was not writing about the answer so much as the question. The ambiguity of Anna\u2019s origin and inability to definitely identify her during her lifetime immortalized Anastasia and I adore how Lawhon\u2019s narrative plays on that reality.The novel incorporates great historic details, but I will admit to struggling with a handful of scenes. As much as I loved the story, I was keenly aware that certain moments were based more on rumor rather than verifiable fact and while I appreciate what those passages brought in terms of storytelling, the history buff in me couldn\u2019t help wrinkling her nose. Lawhon\u2019s characterization of Anastasia was also more mature and worldly than I envision her, but at the end of the day my only real comment on Lawhon\u2019s interpretation is that it\u2019s clear she favored Anna. I can\u2019t presume to know why, but reading between the lines, the author seemed to have more fun with Anna\u2019s chapters than she did Anastasia\u2019s.Imaginatively tenacious and creatively composed, I Was Anastasia brings life to a mystery that captivated the world for much of the twentieth century.

When I was around 12 years old I became interested in the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia/Anna Anderson story. And just young enough and romantic enough to believe Anna was truly the Grand Duchess and survived the Revolution. But, like most young dreams and fantasies it was not to be. I\u2019m honestly having a hard time with this review because there are no words that would adequately describe this book. The Anna Anderson timeline itself starts in the present and works backwards with parts of Anastasia's life woven in which is going forward. And this was absolutely brilliant! I loved how the author gave us descriptions of the Romanov\u2019s days as captives, I don\u2019t ever remember reading details quite like this before. I knew how the ending was going to be, but I was still tense and anxious like this was my first reading of the Tsar family story. Then Ariel gifts us with this awesome last chapter followed by an internal dialogue of Anna Anderson, which was very astute. And then follows that with the best Author\u2019s note ever.

Takeaway for those who don't want it spoiled - historical novel that sacrifices depth and character development for a gimmicky structure. DISCLAIMER: I received an advance copy of this book from Edelweiss in return for an honest review. Ok, if you want to know more, scroll downThis is my first experience reading Ariel Lawhon and I'm deeply disappointed. I've been reading historical fiction for over twenty years and have been fascinated by the Romanovs almost as long. Lawhon has made some odd choices that box her into a corner with this book - the gimmicky \"Memento\" structure is set up so that you don't know Anna Anderson's true identity until the last pages of the book. Frankly, I don't understand why this increases the suspense. The reader knows the real Anastasia didn't escape and various clues are scattered throughout the book give away that Anna Anderson is not Anastasia. Instead, the backwards-running structure prevents any kind of in-depth character development or insight into Anna Anderson. She's a gold mine for a writer in terms of psychological exploration but Lawhon can't do that but because she has to keep the \"secret\" going. The forwards-running Anastasia timeline is decent although none of the Romanov family acts according to the time period or their documented personalities. I'm actually offended that the marketing copy claims Lawhon is the first author \"with the guts\" to take on this story. Ariana Franklin crafted a compelling, atmospheric mystery taking this story on in \"City of Shadows\" and Mary Morrissey wrote a haunting look at the reasons a woman takes on another identity in \"The Pretender.\" Try harder everyone - this is why I keep getting burned out on reading historical fiction"}, {"userName": "Wendy'sThoughts", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17755575-wendy-sthoughts", "userReview": "4.5 A Tale of Two Women Stars* * * * Spoiler FreeYears ago when I was a teenager I saw the movie Anastasia with Ingrid Bergman and Yul Brenner. It captivated me. As I sat in my living room watching this Black and White film, everything about it was a wonder. The acting, the subtle romance between Yul Brenner and Ms. Bergman... I was hooked. I then found Nicholas and Alexandra: An Intimate Account of the Last of the Romanov and the Fall of Imperial Russia. It was a 1967 biography of the last royal family of Russia by historian Robert K. Massie. I inhaled that and always wondered about what was the real story behind this Myth. Ariel Lawhon has written a book which takes us on a journey of two women... they are on a collision course ...destined to converge at the end...It is done with a sure hand and may take a moment to see how all of this is happening... But Happening it is The main focus is on the woman known as Anna Andersen and also the Royal Family Romanov during their last months. We have Anna's story told from her perspective... a long and hard life with insights of all those around her who made her journey difficult... but also possible...We see how things were during all the years she was trying to receive the justice in recognition she so dearly wanted. We meet all the players...society's Grand Dames of the time who make her their house guest ...only to enjoy the notoriety...We go back in time with each important moment and see the manipulation by all... including Anna's...And then there is the telling of the fall of the Romanov's through Anastasia's eyes. Her love of her family and her place in it. Her ability to see what is happening before most of them. The telling of the hardships they learn to endure. The fight to hold on when everything is crashing around them....This story is done in such a way where you are given enough fact mixed with some of the author's admitted mixture of characters to want to know more. Anna was a hard person to feel for as Anastasia was someone to love...Yet both play off each other and in order to have the full story... this way to telling it was very unusual...It kept you wondering and so you kept reading... even though you do have much of it already in your mind...I shall always love the Ingrid Bergman movie...and since it and many of the books out there were made long before more information about the Romanov Family has come to light...It is safe to say... The Myth will still live on as long as those want it...A gifted copy was provided by Doubleday Books via NetGalley for an honest review.For more Reviews, Free E-books and Giveaways"}, {"userName": "Kaila", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33672538-kaila", "userReview": "I've been attracted to fictionalized versions of the Anastasia Romanov story for as long as I can remember (especially the recent Broadway musical and the 1997 film that inspired it), and even if Ariel Lawhon's\u00a0I Was Anastasia is far from a romanticized, child-friendly take on the tale, it instantly intrigued me when it came onto my radar. I love the notion of the whole history being unfolded in a dual timeline that explores the bloody Russian Revolution and Romanov family's fall from grace, as well as Anna Anderson's more present claims that she is the long lost Grand Duchess, a survivor of the tragedies of the past.Lawhon's dual timeline approach is ultimately both why this novel appealed to me and why I had a hard time loving it as much as I thought I would. While the past timeline unfolds linearly, the present timeline begins in the late twentieth century and works its way backwards towards the truth of what happened the night the royal family faced their execution. Reverse timelines are inherently tricky to pull off ... and with good reason. They're hard for an audience to follow because everything you're reading now is build-up for what you read\u00a0before, which requires some mental gymnastics when you're used to the opposite, and telling a story backwards also require a high level of opacity from the narrator in order to not give away past events. I had a very difficult time immersing myself in the present timeline for that exact reason\u2014I felt like I was just getting to know characters as they would disappear from the storyline, and I constantly had to re-orient myself after every shift in time and remember we were moving\u00a0backward not forward. It was hard for me to connect with Anna Anderson or the other characters in her life as she sought to prove her identity as Anastasia.I did, however, adore the richness of the past storyline, which explores the lives of the Romanov family when everything they know has been up-ended. I thought the characters and their interactions with one another were fascinating, especially the loyalty of the Romanovs' servants and other hired help, as well as the unexpected bonds that form with the original guards. It's especially moving since that timeline is told from a child's perspective, and we watch Anastasia's innocence get stripped away through dark and brutal scenes that left me chilled to the core.What I love most about\u00a0I Was Anastasia is that Lawhon manages to keep you hoping and praying and holding out for an ending that you know isn't coming from the start. For anyone familiar with the Romanov tale, there's only one way that the collision of the past and present timelines can result, and yet I was still holding my breath during those final chapters.Even though I found Anna Anderson's story in the present timeline to be confusing and hard to connect with, I did love the past timeline and enjoyed\u00a0I Was Anastasia overall. It's more than apparent that Lawhon has invested much research and care into this novel, and now I'm even fascinated to continue learning more about the truth behind the Romanov story.Blog \u2022 Instagram \u2022 Twitter\u00a0\u2022 Bloglovin'"}, {"userName": "Madeleine (Top Shelf Text)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6821478-madeleine-top-shelf-text", "userReview": "Review to come!"}, {"userName": "Tracey", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15400085-tracey", "userReview": "WOW! Just, a 5+ stars WOW!A big Thank you goes out to Netgalley/Doubleday Publishing and the author Ariel Lawhon for an advanced ebook copy. \u201cAm I truly Anastasia Romanov? A beloved daughter. A revered icon. A Russian grand duchess.\u201d This book was just exquisite! When I was around 12 years old I became interested in the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia/Anna Anderson story. And just young enough and romantic enough to believe Anna was truly the Grand Duchess and survived the Revolution. But, like most young dreams and fantasies it was not to be. I\u2019m honestly having a hard time with this review because there are no words that would adequately describe this book. The Anna Anderson timeline itself starts in the present and works backwards with parts of Anastasia's life woven in which is going forward. And this was absolutely brilliant! I loved how the author gave us descriptions of the Romanov\u2019s days as captives, I don\u2019t ever remember reading details quite like this before. I knew how the ending was going to be, but I was still tense and anxious like this was my first reading of the Tsar family story. Then Ariel gifts us with this awesome last chapter followed by an internal dialogue of Anna Anderson, which was very astute. And then follows that with the best Author\u2019s note ever. I am sure most if not all know the ending to this story, I say, Read. It. Anyway. This book has become my favorite historical read of 2017! And that book cover is my absolute favorite, ever!

I received this book for free in exchange for an honest review. All thoughts and opinions are my own.The Romanov Family has long since fascinated the world. A royal family removed from the throne, forced to become prisoners, and then executed. And then the most notorious part of the whole story was if Princess Anastasia survived the mass killing of her family. And if Anastasia did survive which one of the many women making the claim that she was the real Anastasia was actually her? It all sounds like a blockbuster movie, which it actually was several times over. Ariel Lawhon forges ahead in I Was Anastasia attempting to figure out the mystery of who really was the true Anastasia. \"A young woman bearing an uneasy resemblance to Anastasia Romanov is pulled shivering and senseless from a canal. Refusing to explain her presence in the freezing water, she is taken to the hospital, where an examination reveals that her body is riddled with countless horrific scars. When she finally does speak, this frightened, mysterious woman claims to be the Russian grand duchess, Anastasia.\" I love any stories centered around royal families because it is so outside of my normal realm of life and because of that it completely fascinates me. Going into this book I was very unfamiliar with the Romonav family so some of the history in the book did go above my head. Because of this fact I now want to know everything about the Romanov family. I Was Anastasia peaked my interest about a time in history that I am not familiar with at all. The only issue I had with this book was the writing structure. I love a story that begins at the end and works its way backward, but this book went back and forth in time A LOT. It left me disoriented at times and made the book move along in a disjointed way to me. It took at least a quarter of the book for me to get oriented with the writing style, characters, and storyline to actually begin enjoying it. Once I finally got a handle on the writing style I became completely absorbed in the story. After I finished reading the book I was left wishing I had someone in the room with me so we could discuss it ASAP. Lawhon definitely has a good handle on the historical suspense genre. I have read all of her previous work and I think each of her books has the ability to absorb you completely in her storytelling and writing style. \"Laughter in the face of fear is no small accomplishment.\" - Page 23If you are a fan of Susan Meissner's writing then you will enjoy reading all of Ariel Lawhon's work."}, {"userName": "Deanne Patterson", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34916386-deanne-patterson", "userReview": "Is she or is she not? That is the question surrounding Anna Anderson who insists she survived the massacre of her family in the basement. She claims to be Anastasia Romanov, the Russian Grand Duchess. She bears an uncanny resemblance to her and has many scars on her body that she says prove her identity. Back then dna testing was not available to prove or disprove her story.Fascinating yet horrifying this historical suspense is based on research the author has done. Many scenes and wording of sentences are true to her research. The author has in her research sifted through 50 years of facts in this book with it's many twists and turns. Anna Anderson had a 50 year battle to be recognized as Anastasia Romanov, survivor of the bloodshed that happened that night. Did she succeed and live a happy life?

Is she the beloved daughter, revered icon, and Russian Grand Duchess or is she an imposter, liar, and the thief of another woman's legacy?\nCountless others have rendered their verdict. Now it is your turn.Russia, July 17, 1918:  Under direct orders from Vladimir Lenin, Bolshevik secret police force Anastasia Romanov, along with the entire imperial family, into a damp basement in Siberia where they face a merciless firing squad. None survive. At least that is what the executioners have always claimed. Germany, February 17, 1920:  A young woman bearing an uncanny resemblance to Anastasia Romanov is pulled shivering and senseless from a canal. Refusing to explain her presence in the freezing water or even acknowledge her rescuers, she is taken to the hospital where an examination reveals that her body is riddled with countless, horrific scars. When she finally does speak, this frightened, mysterious young woman claims to be the Russian Grand Duchess.As rumors begin to circulate through European society that the youngest Romanov daughter has survived the massacre at Ekaterinburg, old enemies and new threats are awakened. With a narrative that is equal parts The Talented Mr. Ripley and Memento,  Lawhon wades into the most psychologically complex and emotionally compelling territory: the nature of identity itself. The question of who Anna Anderson is and what actually happened to Anastasia Romanov creates a saga that spans fifty years and touches three continents.
