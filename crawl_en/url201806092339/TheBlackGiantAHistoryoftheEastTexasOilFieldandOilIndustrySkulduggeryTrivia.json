{"ratings": 1, "userreviews": [], "description": "The discovery of the Black Giant in 1930 was the largest oil strike in the U.S. at that time, and its gushers changed the face of the oil industry. Oilmen, promoters, oil patch workers, and the nation's unemployed streamed into the tiny hamlets of East Texas for their share, but they faced wars between \"big oil\" and independent oilmen, bootleg or \"hot oil,\" martial law, and legalized price fixing. Yet the Black Giant turned out to be the salvation of the drought-stricken farmers, helped in the fight against Germany and Japan, and made lots of folks \"Texas rich.\" In \"The Black Giant,\" the characters, times and oil industry skullduggery are recalled and explained in dozens of sidebars full of humorous facts and trivia. The author, law professor at Washing College of Law, The American University, practiced oil and gas law for more than 35 years and focused on oil and gas matters during the Arab oil embargo for the U.S. Department of the Interior.", "title": "The Black Giant: A History of the East Texas Oil Field and Oil Industry Skulduggery & Trivia", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/284442.The_Black_Giant", "average": 2.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1392026379l/284442.jpg", "reviews": 0, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/165169.James_M_Day", "name": "James M.
