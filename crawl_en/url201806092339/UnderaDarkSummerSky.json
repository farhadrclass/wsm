I'm only 12% into the book - reading- and RE-READING gorgeous sentences that make me vibrate all over. Yes it's a book about the major natural disaster which happened in 1935.....( I haven't even gotten to that part yet).....but the author did inspired me to watch old U-tubes of the real tragedy - look at old photos- and the real event - before I began this novel. And...Yes...it's about racial tensions between the black and whites--Yes...I think about the horrific conditions our veterans were working under while building a bridge... Fighting with each other....drinking to numb their pain Yes....the reader feels like they are part of community in the fictional town Heron Key...Yes...I've fallen in love with characters already: Missy, (our star reader), Selma, and the memory of Grace, ( Selma's mother) Yes...I can imagine how the Sherif feels... Mixed Anger can be challenging ... Blame often leads to shame. Yes...I feel sorry for the wealthy white couple: Mr. & Mrs. Kincaids. We all know by now-- in the year 2015... being wealthy ... does not mean no suffering. Yes...My heart breaks for the town doctor: A good man...Doc Williams who feels helpless . He is dreading attending the big July 4th BBQ celebration & Fireworks on the beach the only celebration where blacks and whites are both invited\u2026( of course the blacks must stay on their side of the beach). Doc is prepared ( with his medical bag), to handle minor burns from reckless fireworks, and maybe even some violence between blacks and whites but what makes him most sad...is his memory at a past July 4th BBQ /fireworks, celebration...is that he could not save a young girl from getting LOCKED JAW- and dying....( didn't get to her soon enough), ... After she stepped on a rusty nail. This was the year 1935.

It's FATHER's DAY. HAPPY FATHER's DAY to all the Men ...( father's or not).., anyone who has mentored another human being. ....andJULY 4th is around the corner ...in 1935, (a time when blacks and whites had separate bathrooms), in Vanessa Lafaye's novel, and in our lives now...2015. (We've much to be thankful for)...Vanessa wrote the best line: \"NO ONE COULD PARTITION THE SKY\"Part 2 soon........(I promise to keep it shorter)\"Folks never tired of coming up with ever more inventive ways to hurt each other. Seems they had endless energy for that. It sickened her, all of it. At times like these, she felt the best thing for Heron Key would be to sweep it all away--this stupid grievances, going back nearly a hundred years, and the more recent ones. The coral beneath their feet was soaked in these old hatreds. It needed to be scraped clean, and then maybe they could make a fresh start. Yes, that's what we need. A fresh start.\"CAREFUL WHAT YOU SAY..... ( it just might happen).....I promised to keep this short: There are 'Peach Cobbler Pie' moments and then there is a huge lump in your stomach by injustice, brutal abuse, pain, anger, shame, fear, determination, naked corpses anonymous in death .... Aftermath injuries... Transformation and love....The storytelling of this storm's fury is absolutely riveting!The AUTHORS NOTES .... & QUESTIONS with the AUTHOR ... at the end adds a wonderful touch... Gives the reader a 'treat' actually after reading her novel. One of the questions for Vanessa Lafaye was...,\"who was your favorite character?\" She named one... then her 2nd favorite. They were MINE TOO.... and for THE SAME REASONS!One more great quote from this novel... then I'll leave you guys alone! Just go read it already!!!\"We rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope, and hope does not put us to shame.\"Thank You to the publisher Sourcebooks Landmark, Netgalley, and Vanessa Lafaye for the great opportunity to read this book!

The working conditions are awful and huge hurricane is on its way.At Heron Key in 1935 , there's tension in the air - literally and figuratively- a hurricane is coming and racial tensions abound . A brutal beating of a white woman is blamed on an innocent black man , whites only are allowed in the shelter as the hurricane ravages amidst the horrible racism. I've never been in a hurricane but the author makes you feel what it might be like . It about more than the hurricane though . It's about racism and the after effects of war, about loyalty , love and family and about a shameful time in America's history.I loved the characters , especially Doc who has himself suffered the affects of the war but yet cares about people and sees beauty where others don't . I also loved Missy and her selfless bravery to save a child . This is a sad and heartbreaking story in many ways but there is the savings grace of people's love for each other that provides hope in the end .

The vets sent to the Florida Keys to build roads and the abysmal conditions they lived in. The hurricane that hit Islamorada in the Keys, though in this book it is called Heron Bay. But what makes the story are the people on the island, this is the part that is created and the author did a wonderful job. One gets the full force of racial segregation, relationships that are not what they should be and even a little voodoo thrown on for a little magical realism. When the storm hits it is horrific and powerful, as are the descriptions. The desperation, the fear, which brings out the worst and the best in people. Intense and violent, the few whom are left after the storm must work to bring their community back together.Wonderful, solid storytelling, using historical events as a background for a little known period of history. As always the author's note is appreciated. One interesting fact is that when the actual hurricane hit the Keys, Hemingway was living in Key West and was one of the first people who came to help.ARC from NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Iris P", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2641948-iris-p", "userReview": "**Please be aware that my review contains what might be considered spoilers**Under a Dark Summer Sky a debut novel by author Vanessa Lafaye, is an intense and enthralling piece of historical fiction. Lafaye, who was born in Tallahassee and grew up in Tampa, has created a great story that blends the true history of a major natural disaster, a love story and a violent (but somehow underwhelming) crime mystery.This is a fictionalized novel set in Florida during the summer of 1935 as one of the most intense and devastating hurricanes in US history made landfall, literally erasing a good portion of the upper Florida Keys from the map.According to an article in the Sun Sentinel \"The storm destroyed Henry Flagler's railroad that connected Key West to the mainland and is said to have cleared every tree and every building off Matecumbe Key\".Although the author chose to set the story in the summer of 1935, the hurricane actually hit Islamorada (fictionalized as Heron Key in the novel) the same year on Labor Day weekend.This category 5 storm known as the \"1935 Labor Day hurricane\", never got an official name since the National Hurricane Center (NHC) only started the practice of formally naming storms in 1953 (up until 1979 all the storms had female names, since then male and female names are used interchangeably).Compare to other major hurricanes, the financial impact of the 1935 Labor Day hurricane was relatively small ($6 million dollars), but the lost of lives was staggering, in total more than 400 people lost their lives during this horrific natural disaster.To me one of the strengths of this novel is how accurate the author highlights the tensions that arise when disasters strike and resources are limited. These types of events tend to reveal the best and worst of human nature.\nHenry Flagler\u2019s railroad was destroyed during the 1935 Labor Day hurricane. When you travel to The Florida Keys you can see what remains of the old Bridge.The first scene of Under a Dark Summer Sky, in which an alligator tries to take a baby away from the family's backyard and have him for lunch, gives you a sense as how intense and dramatic this novel is going to be.As the story begins, it's the summer of 1935, Franklin Roosevelt is president and the nation is still reeling from the ravaging effects of the Depression, as well as the overwhelming aftermath of World War I. Although racial tensions have taken a backseat, the Jim Crow laws are alive and well and remain a very present reality in the lives of most African Americans.The residents of Heron Key are not happy when a group of World War I veterans come to live in their midst. After coming back from the war, many veterans couldn't find jobs and Congress and the Federal Government failed to deliver a bonus that had been promised to the veteran soldiers.In an effort to control the political backlash that came as a result, the Roosevelt administration decided to move veterans as far away from Washington as possible. The government created public works projects and offered jobs to over 200 dissapointed and unruly war veterans, black and white, that ended up living in Heron Key.By Depression-Era standards, the folks of Heron Key seem to have escaped the worst of the economic woes most the rest of the country is experiencing, but life is certainly not easy especially for its African American citizens. Still the town enjoys a relatively pleasant and agreeable lifestyle, like it was typical in many places during this pre-civil rights era, everybody knows their place. Both black and white residents are very aware where social lines are drawn and are careful not to cross them.But the veteran's presence disrupts this fragile balance between its residents and we see how prejudices and old conflicts bubble to the surface.The novels introduces a wide and interesting cast of characters. I found it a little difficult to keep track of all the names, particularly during the first chapters of the novel. The narrative jumps pretty fast from one character to another, which was to me one of the shortcomings of this book.Henry Roberts, is probably the most complex and interesting character. He is an African American war veteran and a native of Heron Key. After living in France during the war and experiencing how it felt to live in a racially desegregated society (that included having a white French lover), he returns to America, but he's trying to find his place and purpose and struggles with the realities of racial inequality in his home country.Nelson and Hilda Kincaid are the richest but very unhappy white couple in town.Missy Douglas, a sweet and noble African-American, works as the nanny for the Kincaids. Missy has harbored feelings for Henry since she was a young girl. When he returns to Heron Key, she's hopeful that they can start things where the left them 17 years ago.Dwayne Campbell is the town sheriff, his marriage is in ruins after his wife gave birth to a baby of mixed race; and Selma, Henry\u2019s sister has the ability to invoke supernatural forces (yes there's a little touch of magical realism on the book but the author keeps this to a minimum, so don't let that turn you off if that not your thing).Three generations after the end of slavery, the town's Fourth of July barbecue remains a segregated event. Still this is the annual party everybody in Heron Key looks forward to attend.Initially things appear to be going well but the harmony doesn't last long. Tensions between black and white residents boil over after the vets, some of whom have drank too much, start disrupting the party.Later on that night when Hilda is found almost beaten to death, suspicions immediately land on Henry despite the lack of any physical evidence and talks of a lynching begin circulating.The story then follows the investigation to solve the mystery of who attacked Hilda and what what was the motivation behind the it.In the meantime, the authorities of Heron Key have been getting regular updates from the local weatherman about a potential dangerous storm that is rapidly approaching the Florida straits.Predicting the weather has always being an inexact science, but it was really fascinating to learn how primitive the science of meteorological forecasting was in those days and how little technology was available to the people involved in making hurricane predictions.Once the hurricane makes landfall and begins wreaking havoc on the island, it becomes a character itself.Lafaye deftly describes the storm's intensity, unpredictability and it's determination to destroy everything that comes on its path.Be prepared to read some very detailed and harrowing passages describing the loss of human life and treasure. By one account, the force of the winds was such that  \"People caught in the open were blasted by sand with such force that it stripped away their clothing\".I had known about this real life event in Florida's history before, but reading it in the context of this dramatic novel and learning how badly these veterans were treated put it a different light for me. According to official records, out of the 400 plus victims of the hurricane, 259 were WWI veterans. It's inexcusable that these vets were placed in inadequate tent-like housing, under Florida's scorching summer temperatures and right in the midst of hurricane season. There were plans to send a train from Miami to rescue the veterans from the storm, but a mix of apathy, government bureaucracy and a lack of a reliable chain of command doomed the mission from the beginning. By the time the train arrived in the Keys, it was too late and many died on board when it was swept of its tracks by the storm surge.The book includes an addendum with the \"Author's Note\" which I very much appreciated. It provides fascinating details about the historical and political context of the story. The author mentions that Ernest Hemingway, who was a resident of Key West at the time, was one of the first to arrive in Islamorada after the storm had passed.\nA picture of the relief train that was sent to rescue WWI veterans after it was swept by the storm surge. Following his visit, Hemingway wrote a scathing magazine article denouncing the failed government rescue efforts titled \"Who Murdered The Vets?.Hemingway's anger is very palpable when you read his letter, here's a paragraph:\"It is not necessary to go into the deaths of the civilians and their families since they were on the Keys of their own free will; They made their living there, had property and knew the hazards involved. But the veterans had been sent there; they had no opportunity to leave, nor any protection against hurricanes; and they never had a chance for their lives\".The novel still manages to end on a solemn but hopeful note when the survivors gather to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of the storm and remember those that were lost, but are also grateful to be alive and make plans for their future.Under a Dark Summer Sky with its blend of history, mystery and a touch of romance makes for a very nice summer read."}, {"userName": "Esil", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3643764-esil", "userReview": "Thank you to Netgalley and the publisher for an opportunity to read an advance copy of Under a Dark Summer Sky. 3 1/2 stars. Based on real historical events, this book tells the story of a small community in the Florida keys in the mid 1930s that was hit by a devastating hurricane. It also tells the story of a group of WWI veterans who were in a work camp in the area at the time. The first two thirds of the book set out the social structure of the community and the relationships between the different characters. And the last third deals with the storm and how people react, work together and work against each other. The story is told from the perspective of a few interconnected characters in different social circumstances. Through the story and not in a preachy way, the book deals with race relations, the suffering of returning veterans, domestic abuse and how people behave -- good and bad -- in the face of catastrophic events. And it has one of the most gripping edge of your seat opening scenes I remember reading. And the end is hard to read and sad. And the very end leaves a glimmer of hope. In other words, Under a Dark Summer Sky has all of the makings of a good read, which it definitely is. Two caveats which explain my 3 1/2 star rather than 4 star rating: 1) the characters were somewhat unidimensional, fitting the purpose of the narrative rather than adding complexity to the story and 2) the thread of the story seemed to get messy -- close to silly-- and lose its way just before the storm, but it all came back into sharp focus again during the storm -- so no biggy. It's an impressive first novel, generally written simply but with occasional great sentences. Well worth the read if you're in the mood for a good story."}, {"userName": "Carole", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630646-carole", "userReview": "You'd never believe this is written by a 1st time author!

Top 50 Books of 2015 Best Southern Historical Fiction Debut (Florida Keys) racial & social tensions UNDER A DARK SUMMER SKY  by Vanessa Lafaye  is a powerful, poignant southern fiction debut, crossing several genres\u2014from history, literary, romance, crime, suspense, and thriller, of secrets and lies, capturing the essence of time and history, racial unrest, social issues, and misplaced war veterans, combined with one of the worst hurricanes in American history, set in 1935 in the Florida Keys. Based on true historical events, a love story of determination, overcoming a past, fighting against all odds -- Highly recommend.  When I first viewed this cover  on NetGalley, I knew this book was for me, and wow, I was not disappointed. Immediately upon viewing the usage of Broadway font, on the front cover designers pick up on these things a draw from the era--fascinating yet complicated thirties, and a dazzling front cover- was intrigued. front and back packaging excellent- hats off to the designer.  Combined with a captivating summary which grabbed me at hello- my favorite genre; an avid lover of history, and a former resident of the Florida Keys (current South Florida resident)- was HOOKED prior to opening page one. However, the real treat  and unexpected delight - the author\u2019s brilliant writing and research (did I misread\u2014\"A debut\"?) If this is a debut, cannot imagine what is to come! Wow, this mesmerizing story captured me from beginning to end, and am still pondering, while writing my review. Each word jumps off the page, the emotions and intensity of each character, so profound; the vivid settings taking you back in time, the Old Florida Keys, while reliving a troubled past, as you experience the humid heat, the tension, amidst the storm, the suspense, and the racial unrest \u2013sending chill bumps down my spine. Nothing better  than a true to life historic account, mixed with a magical fictional twist, blended for a riveting tale, reminiscent of another time. Not an easy task, and Lafaye executes with finesse and sensitivity for an impressive well-paced delivery. A page-turner\u2014I read this one in one sitting. Set in the Florida Keys in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, in the summer of the fictional town of Heron Key (actual Islamorada-my favorite place in the entire Keys),  a place where wealthy tourists come to enjoy the beaches, riding the Henry Flagler East Coast Railway to Key West. However, not all was so peaceful and glorious. Unfortunately The Jim Crow laws  were in place, demanding racial segregation enforced through state and local laws after the Reconstruction period in Southern US, continuing in force until 1965. Florida was of course included. The beaches were separated, colored and whites, stores, public restrooms, schools, and the list goes on and on. To further complicate matters,  a group of misplaced homeless, and jobless World War I veterans were granted an opportunity to join a public works project in the Keys, among three work camps spread throughout the Keys. At first the veterans were excited to be a part of this project, until they arrived to see the poor living and working conditions and the lack of respect and mistreatment. No wonder they are angry\u2026first the war, then this? If you happened to be black, you were all but doomed. The local people,  generations known as Conchs were not so accepting. Their lives were invaded by hard-drinking, disturbed (shell shocked instead of PTSD, as known today), and dangerous men in their midst.  If you know the area, it is isolated and not a lot of room to spread out.  Worst of all, the government was of little assistance, and did not offer a support system to this group of brave men who fought to save our country. (so sad) Combined with the brutal climate,  unfair treatment, unbearable working conditions, building a railway bridge in the hot heat, treated as second rate citizens, and the inadequate facilities, mixed with the racial issues-- you have a difficult and unbearable situation. Now it is about to become even worse than a danger war zone, with the most powerful hurricane approaching. Some did not take it seriously. The worst ever to strike North America in 1935. These poor men cannot catch a break.  As the book opens  we meet the lovely black young woman, Missy whose job is to take care of little baby Nathan, son of Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid. Mrs. Kincaid comes from money, however, she forced her marriage due to her pregnancy and over the years, the former beauty queen, now fat and lonely, and her cheating drinking husband makes no secret of his affairs with the many women at the country club.When an alligator is close  to eating Little Nathan for lunch (very funny), while in her care, made me think of Million Dollar Road by Amy Conner ; Missy and her friend Selma act quickly to divert a tragedy before the Kincaid's arrive home in preparation for the annual Fourth of July picnic. Selma her dear friend\u2019s son Henry Roberts was one of the unfortunate ones to go off to war, and shows up to help with the cleanup and aftermath. (this fiasco ties in with something later). Missy has been in love  with Henry Roberts since she was a little girl, waiting her entire life for his return. He was a little older and the young man she looked up to. She has never been anywhere much outside of home, with little chance for an education, a future, and dreams of one day marrying Henry Roberts with a family of her own. She still lives with her mother (mama). However, she is smart, and she loves Nathan. She given an entire set of encyclopedias (don\u2019t we all recall these), so she stays abreast of the world in her on way, through her books. In the south they sold two items: encyclopedias and grave plots, which I recall growing up . However, she is shocked  when discovering Henry Roberts has been here working in the camp and never looked her up. He is back! She has waited her entire life for this day. She assumed he had met some French woman or possibly too sophisticated now, for her. Nothing could be further from the truth. A bright future ahead of him, when he left; now he is stuck in this Godforsaken place, and what would he have to offer Missy? A damaged, broke, and skeleton of a man he used to be. The government has gotten him into this mess of a life but he is determined to escape.When the town gathers  for the annual 4th picnic, the whites, blacks, and veterans will be mingling, with free flowing booz, with years of pent up anger and violence- a combo for trouble. White Sherriff Dwayne Campbell is anticipating it, and he too has some unresolved old issues and secrets, a past , violence---when his wife gave birth to a black baby and she refuses to name the father. He takes out his anger on more than one. While at the picnic,  trouble breaks out, a white woman gets beat up and left for dead and the blame and suspicion has to be directed at someone. Henry Roberts would make an easy fall guy, especially when Campbell overhears rumors Roberts could be the father of his son, while the real killer is out there running free, and a woman is fighting for her life. Missy is out to claim her man and the life she wanted, and tries desperately to help defend him from a system who wants to destroy her love, and the man she admires. There is a damaged veteran doctor full of grief, who wants to save the woman he may love, and a group of veterans left hanging without a care for their safety, a train which may never arrive to take them away, as a storm gets closer and the only shelter will not allow coloreds, and the rest are left out in a storm which will destroy everything in its path. An escape, a train, a shelter, a hurricane, and lost souls. - Intense! A cast of well-developed characters,  desperate to save their own lives and the ones they love, while dealing with a past of mistakes for an intense and dangerous race against time, winds, rains, and storms of life-- will there be anything left after this disaster, to start a new? A gripping southern suspense debut with some characters you will despise and some you will adore. You will fall in love with Missy and Henry Roberts and continue rooting for them, as well as Missy, Doc, and some of the others who are mistreated in so many ways. I loved the boxcar scene when the people from the shelter were run out\u2026priceless!I enjoyed the well-researched history notes, as always alarming to know Florida's status as \"Lynching capital of the South in 1935.\" Often authors dismiss Florida, writing of other deep southern states. However, as the author points out, lynchings were carried out for a variety of crimes and nothing worse than a crime of violence by a black man (like Henry Roberts) against a white woman, or accused even though innocent. During this time it was about the white man, and the misdirected power, as they ruled the government both state and federal, especially those with money.   \"The poor black women, such as Selma, Mama, and Missy had no civil rights, as we know today. In addition, being a veteran during this time whether white or black was extremely hard, as many left their jobs and families to fight for their country but came back to destitution. In 1922 Congress approved a bonus for their service due to be paid in 1945. Pressure was on to make early payment when in 1932, 40,000 vets and their families made camp outside the US Capitol building. Was approved for the house but defeated by Senate and later had to wait until 1936 to get their bonus.\" You can read more at the end of the book \u2013 fascinating!

Not only is the sea rising to dangerous levels and the ever-changing winds confusing the weather forecasters, but the tension in the town has reached its own boiling point. Racial prejudice is rampant and veteran soldiers have arrived in the area to help build a major bridge. The soldiers are a mixture of black and white but are all victims of discrimination, living in squalor and treated like animals. Things get even worse when a local white lady is found beaten and close to death following a Labor Day beach party. The assumption of guilt falls on a former army officer, a black man, down on his luck, yet there is no logical reason for this assumption. The law doesn't seem to apply in Florida and the voice of a black man is not going to be heard. As the storm comes closer and closer, just who is going to face the impending chaos and who will be affected the most?This is historical fiction at its finest. Full of depth, despair, fear, hope, love, loss and friendship. So many emotions are brought to the foreground, it becomes the readers world for the novels entirety.  The author has included an informative historical note at the beginning of the book, which explains the whole idea behind the veterans of Heron Key. This is a real help to the reader, and adds more depth to the characters that are introduced along the way. From page one, where were enter the world of Missy and Selma, (both black servants in a racist town, full of wealthy, bored and dishonest white folk), the novel reaches out and sucks you in. The blacks are plodding along, never expecting change, afraid to dream of a different world, The whites are, for the most, miserable. Money may buy them nice homes and cars, afford them access to the finest dressmakers and cooks, yet it can't buy love or genuine respect. It is hard not to draw comparisons to Katerine Stockett's The Help or The Secret Life of Bees by Sue Monk Kidd, as they both lovingly told of the relationships between blacks and whites in past times. However, this novel also has aspects which are reminiscent of The Color Purple. Strong, female characters, fighting to exist for the sake of their families, friends and their own sanity. It shows how women have, and still do, have to fight that bot harder to find their inner happiness. The double weight of being black, and a woman, is not a new concept in literature, but Vanessa Lafaye has cast a new light on it. What concerned the women of this era more? The search for independence, love or education? The love they felt for the white children they were raising was heartrendingly real. The love they felt for their husbands and brothers was intense, deep and long lasting. This book looks at how these women and children were treated when a storm raged through at fatal intensity. It also juxtaposes this storyline with a look at some of the white residents, who hide behind their pale exteriors and masks of contentment. The Kincaid family, barely able to look at each other, the town doctor, lonely and broken, the country club ladies and gents, who drip with dishonesty and the general store owner who just wants to prepare for the storm. The characters are hopping off the page on a regular basis. There are quite a lot of them, but once you get past the initial introductions, each has a part to play in the overall narrative. The writing is superb. Blending the many worlds within Heron Key to a believable and atmospheric ideal. Chapter pacing is just right, historical facts not overloaded and yet there is a balance between the storm, the cultural angle and the love story. It is hard to believe that this is a debut novel, such is the standard, and I cannot recommend this enough. A wonderful blend of history and fiction, finely tuned research and warm writing style, makes this ideal for fans of Sue Monk Kidd and is definitely a book that should be bought, read and savoured. It will linger in many readers minds, as shall the memory of the victims of the 1935 hurricane. A stunning, striking and sensual debut. A complete joy to read."}, {"userName": "Myrna", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8789819-myrna", "userReview": "This is a d\u00e9but novel - it is good.

Tensions are running high in the town: white versus black and local residents versus displaced, disgruntled WWI veterans hired to build the highway across the Keys. When a local beauty queen gone to seed, following the birth of her son, is viciously beaten, the townfolk are seeking justice, ahead of the law. Meanwhile, the local police chief has been cuckolded by his wife, and has a mixed race son, and his agenda is unclear. When this powerful storm hits, the town divides and the veterans, living in hastily constructed shacks, have no idea what is coming and have again been abandoned by their government. Underneath all of this misery though, there are stories of courage, family, love, hatred, friendship, and leadership.

Main characters Missy and Henry are well drawn, but beyond them I thought Lafaye splits the perspective too far: I didn\u2019t need to see through the eyes of lots of the veterans, the shopkeeper, or the policeman investigating the brutal beating of a local white woman. As for this crime, I knew whodunit pretty much right away, so there wasn\u2019t any suspense regarding that plot point.However, Lafaye does do a great job of building tension in the novel\u2019s final third as the storm approaches. I was pleasantly surprised by how violent she let her account get and how unsentimental she was about killing certain characters off.

These men are hardened, sometimes cruel and badly let down. They returned from the battlefields of France, having fought hard for their country to find nothing for them. The compensation that they were promised by the Government didn't appear, they protested to no avail. They find themselves toiling the land on a Government work project, expected to be grateful, but bitter and angry instead. The locals (known as Conches) do not welcome the veterans, they are frightened, wary and suspicious of them.The veterans join the townfolk for their annual Fourth of July beach barbecue, and things soon turn ugly. There are scores to be settled, especially with Henry, a veteran, but also a native of this small town. Henry is pulled between his allegiance to his men, and his love for his estranged family. When local white woman is discovered, beaten half to death, the veterans are the main suspects, and Henry soon finds himself fighting for more than just his country, he has to fight for his honour, and possibly for his life.Vanessa Lafaye draws the reader in from the first chapter and has created layers upon layers of tension. The divided community, the racial hatred, the oppressive heat and the threat of the storm constantly make the reader feel uneasy, yet her writing is so compelling and engaging that each page is turned rapidly, to discover just what will happen next.This is an incredibly powerful story, with deep and very detailed characters. The terrifying and powerful storm is described so well, with details that are both violent and heartbreaking.A novel of small town America, of racial divide, of the strength of nature and ultimately a love story. Summertime is an exquisite piece of writing; rich, satisfying and beautiful."}, {"userName": "Emma Crowley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3981397-emma-crowley", "userReview": "Summertime is the powerful, emotive, tension filled d\u00e9but from Vanessa Lafaye. Like the hurricane that is almost a character itself in this book, the story picks you up, holds you in its grip and spits you back out only after it has put you through one hell of a ride. Right from the gator incident in the opening chapter you know you are in for a frightfully good read. This book is different to anything I have read before as the author was brave to take on so many issues for her first book and handle them in such a manner that you came out rooting for almost all of the characters. In Vanessa Lafaye I think we have found the new queen of building a dramatic, action packed, suspenseful novel that grips you from beginning to end. The historical note at the beginning was welcome and gave me a nice bit of background information as to what was going on in the Florida Keys in the 1930's at the time as I had never read anything set in this period before.The author writes so beautifully and moves the book along at a rapid pace, instantly you are transported to the humid, muggy, sweltering Heron Key where racial injustice lives uneasily alongside the well to do whites. Not forgetting the war veterans isolated on their squalid camp building a bridge the government have given the go ahead to. Their presence in the town makes the residents uneasy. The horrors of the war are still imprinted on these men and many have turned to alcohol as a means of escape. The overwhelming feeling I got from this book was one of oppression - of the blacks, of the war veterans and weird as it made sound the heat and approaching hurricane. The whole way through the book despite it's many storylines is just tension filled as the residents wait for this major storm which may or may not hit their town. Whilst preparing for the hurricane they have to deal with many ongoing issues and towards the end put their differences aside to work for all their greater good. This book is literally like a pressure cooker waiting to explode and the author does such a good job that you are on the edge of your seat both outraged at some of the carry on of people but hopeful the storm will pass by and leave people to begin building relationships and breaking down barriers.Admittedly I did find at the beginning there were many characters to get to know and the story did jump from place to place. I felt the author was trying to fit too much in to start with. But once I got to know Missy, Selma, Henry, Hilda, Dwayne and everyone else I found I was lost in their lives and was intent on discovering what fate had in store for them. So much happens throughout this book it is impossible to go into detail. A wide range of issues are covered the most important being the racial tensions at the time. The whites and blacks are kept separate on the beach and blacks are served at the back door of the shop. That literally made my mouth drop how did people endure such blatant disregard and hatred towards them? Not being able to eat at the same diner as white people and being made to feel like a second class citizen must have been awful to endure. An incident in the shelter at the onset of the storm made me very angry and the open hostility and menace towards Missy and her family was just mind boggling. Alongside the racial storyline and the problems with the veterans was the mystery of Hilda Kincaid's murder which only serves to heighten the overhanging feeling of impending disaster for everyone. Of course some romance was thrown in and I did wonder if this book needed that but in the end I realised it helped the book come full circle.The description of the hurricane and it's devastating impact was utterly mind blowing. You could feel it's mighty force and power as it touched land and destroyed the landscape, people's homes and hearts. It put all the characters problems to one side as mother nature reared her ugly head almost in retaliation for all the things the residents of Heron Key had done. I couldn't read quick enough as page after page of horror and devastation was described in such phenomenal detail that normally would put me off a book. In this case the author had done a fantastic job of setting the scene, developing the story lines and the characters that she just let rip as everything came to a head. Yes it is very hard to read what happens and you will need tissues, she does go into graphic detail but if she hadn't it would have been a let down as so much time and effort had been put into making the reader care about the characters and the outcome. I wanted certain people to get their come comeuppance and others to be seriously hurt or die. Yes it's horrible to say that but some of them were just utterly ruthless and shameful. 'An irritable wind had sprung up to worry the washing on the line' is a line that sums up just what happens in this book. It's more than a wind that puts the worries and concerns to the forefront of the minds of the people living in Heron Key. Vanessa Lafaye has done a stellar job in making me more aware of the social history of America and confirming what a skilled author she is. God this woman has a way with words that has left me utterly captivated by this story.This was gripping, edge of your seat stuff where your heart was literally in your mouth for the second half of the book. Vanessa Lafaye has packed an awful lot into her first novel that makes you think where will she take us next. She is a powerhouse and a bright new talent that will earn legions of fans with this book. No words can do this brilliant book justice, it's an unputdownable must read.

The East Coast Railway stretched down to Key West, bringing tourists to feast upon the still plentiful food and enjoy the luscious beaches. It was also a time of high racial tension. A group of WW1 veterans \u2013 homeless, jobless and denied their bonuses by the Government \u2013 arrives in Heron Key to work on a public works project. For the most part, the locals (the \u201cConches\u201d) eye this disparate group of sometimes irascible men with great hostility, and this is the story of two segregated communities coming together to find an equitable way of living side by side, the impending hurricane of 1935 on the horizon \u2013 in the story it is set on 4th July although the real storm occurred on Labor Day. And apparently it was the most powerful ever to hit America.This is Vanessa Lafaye\u2019s debut novel, and what a writer she is! She has a talent with words that enables her prose to glide across the page, there are no superfluous words, and each paragraph eases the story along. She is a natural creator of atmosphere and suspense, and with a deft hand she creates credible, yet humanly flawed characters. She also creates a very palpable setting, the heat, the oppressive temperatures and the gurgling, sulphurous swampland all assault the reader\u2019s senses.There is Missy who works for the Kincaid family and takes care of their baby Nathan. The book opens as she and Selma set about dismembering an alligator who has attempted to snatch the baby. Hilda Kincaid is troubled in her marriage, and Dwayne Campbell, the local Sheriff, has to manage the friction in the community, and bear the shame of his wife having produced a mixed-race baby. Henry is a member of the veterans group and tries to deny the emotional bond between himself and Missy. Overall, they are a disparate group of people, as in any community, all gearing up to attend the annual beach barbecue; all the while the storm clouds are gathering on all fronts.As the party warms up, so do the temperaments. A small fight breaks out, people leave and as the storm starts to lash across the town. A white woman is found alive but mutilated. Suspicion points to one perpetrator. Race issues are magnified, and chaos descends with a vengeance on the whole area, as it is engulfed by the horrific storm. And this is where the colour drains from the story. The scene is set in the pitch of night, people are driving to escape, finding shelter in the local store or trying to leave by train. The hissing, roiling water from the sea engulfs many \u2013 and gradually the story reveals those who die and those who survive. The prose moves from the fluid, languorous descriptions of the early chapters, to mechanical, jagged passages that reflect the jarring chaos of survival, raw humanity, and limbs torn from limb, snagged, and caught on objects that are jettisoned by the tremendous winds and waves. It has become the scene of a battle ground of the elements.Peace and the humdrum rhythm of daily life, of course, eventually return, but no-one who survived the terrible ordeal is mentally, emotionally or physically the same. The scars are everywhere.Vanessa Lafaye is definitely an author to watch.The review first appeared on our blog: http://www.tripfiction.com/novel-set-..."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul", "userReview": "It is summer 1935. America has come out of the other side of the first world war and is in the midst of the depression. The brave men who fought in the great War have been abandoned by the government who have failed to keep their promises of pensions and other financial support. A large number of them placed in a camp near the tiny Florida community of Heron Key. This was the time of segregation and the tension in the town with so many soldiers nearby is raised further again.After the July the 4th celebrations a white residents wife is found badly beaten and left for dead by a road. One of the soldiers is arrested for her attempted murder and the uneasy truce between the residents and the troops is shattered. As the pressures build in the community and residents are looking to take matters into their own hands, the barometer is dropping, fast. It is hurricane season, and whilst Heron Keys has suffered these before, no one has a single idea just what is coming in.Lafaye has used a bit of artistic licence to bring together several threads and events that happened at broadly similar times. There is the frustration and anger of troops who were promised so much by politicians and received so little, there is the culture of segregation that was frankly poisonous and there is the looming presence of the hurricane that will bring disaster to the Florida Keys. I felt that the first 100 pages of so of the book dragged as the characters were introduced and the scenes were set. After that the book managed to raise the pace and was much better, with the swirl of trial and tribulations of the people of that small community. The description of the residents in the hurricane is pretty scary too as the storm releases its full power. The most terrifying thing is this that tale was all drawn from a set of true stories too. The plight of the troops was real, forced to work and not given the monies they were promised, the horror of segregation and the hurricane that decimated this part of Florida was one of the strongest recorded.

The author opens the novel and I could already tell that there was something stirring up. I got an instant sense of uneasiness which compelled me to continue reading as I wanted to know what was making me so uneasy and also whether or not it would ever be settled. The novel moved at a fast pace and started right in the middle of the action. As far as the characters, there were quite a few but I enjoyed all of them. At times I did get a bit confused because there were so many characters to remember but they all added something to the plot. The dynamic of how they and their characteristics worked together (or against each other) was realistic and refreshing. For example there was an ongoing conflict between Ronald and Ike and it was not magically solved by the end of the novel. This gave their relationship a realistic aspect as most conflicts take time to resolve. Just as I was sucked in to the first page, the author also did a great job tying up this novel at the end. I was not ready for it to end. I became attached to the characters and the fictional town, Heron Key. Every part of this novel was purposeful and well planned, even down to the gripping descriptions and scenes of the horrific hurricane and its aftermath. I loved the fact that although there were racial tensions and tensions between the Veterans and the Conchs, these things became unimportant as they all struggled with survival.Overall, this novel was refreshing and captivating as I couldn't put it down and I became highly attached to the characters and their stories. The storytelling was powerful as the author weaved different cultural aspects of the Floridian town as well as historical elements together.There are just so many good things to say about this novel but I\u2019ll stop here.

The men are housed in flimsy quarters and conditions are poor. A July Fourth celebration separates the whites from the colored, the country club set from those who serve them.

Really appreciated - as soon as I saw the book and read the blurb I was keen to read it.The backdrop of the story is a devastating hurricane (I'd never heard of it but the 'real' story is told by the author in the final pages), and as you read references are made to the barometer changing, which indicates a storm is brewing. This also reflects the general mood of the time. Set in 1930s Florida at the time of racial tensions, this books tells the story of an attack on a white woman, and the assumption is that it is by a black man. It becomes clear that what was first thought might not be correct and I really liked how the story unfolded. I studied American History at university and so was aware that during WW1 black and white men fought on the same battlefields. They fought in different troops but there was a new level of acceptance. What I probably was less aware of was what happened when the troops returned home. Along with the impending hurricane, there is also the backdrop of The Great Depression, which left most struggling. Many of the troops were unable to work (for mental or physical reasons) and were left homeless. As a consequence of demands made on Government, work parties were organised to build roads, railways etc. One such camp was set up in this fictional town on the Florida Keys. It was effectively a shanty town, with poor sanitation etc. The camp again saw troops mixing and getting on with the job in hand. But it caused issues within the towns, as witnessed in this novel. I was surprised, as appeared to be the author, to hear that northern Florida experienced lynchings and killings of black men, and after the \"crime\" was committed Henry, the black man in question, absconded with Jimmy, a white young man, as \"hostage,\" to avoid such a fate. Henry fled north to be free, and it was interesting to see how Henry and Jimmy formed a close relationship, with Jimmy even getting Henry out of a difficult situation. Mid-way through the book the hurricane began to take full effect. The writing is really descriptive and it must be such a scary experience. Pressures were put on the town shelter, and again there were racial tensions, and the black people fled to open train carriages to shelter. The sheer weight of wind and water meant the town shelter was destroyed and the community pulled together and had, in a way, to forget about colour, and concentrate on survival. I enjoyed this book on a number of levels; it is very readable, and educational."}, {"userName": "Christina (Confessions of a Book Addict)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2418140-christina-confessions-of-a-book-addict", "userReview": "It's 1935 in the Florida Keys, a community impacted by the Depression and the remains of war. Many veterans have returned to Florida or are newly arrived to the Keys due to a government job to build a bridge. There's Missy, an African American nanny to the wealthy Kincaid family, who although wasn't formally educated, she read encyclopedias for fun and now possess a wealth of knowledge. She is a nanny for Nelson and Hilda Kincaid, a prominent, but very unhappy couple. Hilda struggles with her weight and has haunting memories of her former life (Miss Palmetto) before she had her son and married Nelson, who takes every opportunity to cheat on her. Then there's Henry, an African American veteran, who has returned home to the Keys after the war as he is going to work on the bridge. There's also Dwayne, the town sheriff, who has to deal with racial tension amongst the locals as well as the veterans who often drink too much and get out of line. Each person in this novel has to deal with some major conflicts and all of this get magnified once a hurricane is heading right towards Heron Key's shores. Vanessa Lafaye's debut, Under a Dark Summer Sky, highlights racial tension in the south as well as what life was like for people living in the Keys during the 1930s, especially when disaster strikes.Read the rest of my review here: http://www.confessionsofabookaddict.c..."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12691311-debbie", "userReview": "Wow, this book was very eye opening. I had no idea that Florida was still that backwards. When you hear about lynchings and things it's usually Mississippi or Alabama.Anyways, this was a very good book I believe a debut. I really felt something for the characters mostly the black ones and as usual, despised the country club folks (the wealthy ones who took advantage).And to find out the servicemen camped in in humane ways was a true story seriously pissed me off. It's too bad Trent wasn't around so that Grimes could get what was coming to him.There were so many wrongs in this book, none of them the writer's fault. I feel ashamed for the people of Heron Key and how they represented America and the human race. Not to be hateful, but I'm glad the grocery store was hit so bad. That part of the story was very shameless.Okay, now back to how great I think this book was. The author did a great job and kept the pace going. I raced through this one because I HAD to get to the ending to see how everyone turned out. This is one of those I will never forget and it was nothing like The Help, other than the way whites treated blacks. There was absolutely no humor in this one at all.Thank you Sourcebooks and Net Galley for allowing me to read and review this emotional and unforgettable book!"}], "description": "The Help meets The Perfect Storm in this debut novel set in 1935 in the broiling Florida KeysHuron Key is already weighed down with secrets when a random act of violence and a rush to judgment viscerally tear the town apart. As the little island burns under the sun and the weight of past decisions, a devastating storm based on the third-strongest Atlantic Hurricane on record approaches, matching the anger of men with the full fury of the skies. Beautifully written and seductive, Under a Dark Summer Sky is at once a glorious love story, a fascinating slice of social history, and a mesmerizing account of what it's like to be in the eye of a hurricane.", "title": "Under a Dark Summer Sky", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23615823-under-a-dark-summer-sky", "average": 3.92, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1416950537l/23615823.jpg", "reviews": 293, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4979689.Vanessa_Lafaye", "name": "Vanessa Lafaye"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23615823-under-a-dark-summer-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24796095-under-a-dark-summer-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23220038-summertime", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34404741-at-first-light", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39294711-miss-marley", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36294869-distant-echoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
