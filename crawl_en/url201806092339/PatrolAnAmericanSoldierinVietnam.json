Walter Dean Myers\u2019 poem takes us into the vulnerable side of every soldier. He uses contrasting images of the lush beauty of the forests of Vietnam and the searing danger of combat, along with contrasting emotions of a cunning pursuit and the weary soldier\u2019s longing for relief. In addition, he uses realistic details of combat to \u201cput us there.\u201d I think that whenever our young readers begin to learn about war, it\u2019s important to balance honoring the soldier without glorifying war, and this book does the job wonderfully. We feel the suspense, the tension of the silence, the shock of the thundering bombers streaking overhead\u2014the paradox of villagers going about their lives in the midst of a war zone. I was particularly drawn in by the author\u2019s ability to bring the characters alive. I felt an instant connection to all the characters in the story. Poets amaze me in how they can do this is so few words. Ann Grifalconi\u2019s illustrations are fantastic and capture all the nuances of the text. I kept finding new details in the collages every time I looked at them again. Together, text and illustrations bring honor to those who must survive war\u2019s horrors. This is a book for ages 11-14, and the strengths of the poetry and the images make it worth reading and re-reading. Older readers would find much to discuss and analyze on many levels\u2014a soldier\u2019s life, combat, Vietnam history, civilians in war, as well as the poetic elements. One of the most moving picture books I've ever read."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Weimert", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7573421-rebecca-weimert", "userReview": "Rebecca WeimertPicture BookPatrol: An American Solider in Vietnam is a story from the point of view of the solider. The solider describes what he is thinking and feeling as he waits for the enemy in the rice paddies of Vietnam. He also describes the village and what he feels when he sees the enemy up close. Although he is fighting for his country, the solider is also ready for the war to be over and wants to go home.As I was researching this book I noticed it was mostly listed as a children\u2019s book, but I would disagree. The story describes killing and bombs. I do not feel this is appropriate for children, but for young adults. Young adults would understand the language used and the metaphors better than a child. In one scene the solider invades a local town and describes the people they are going to attack. This seems a little too old for young children. The story is sad, but the reader gets a first-hand experience of what a real solider in Vietnam actually thought and felt, especially at the end when he describes how much he just wants to go home."}, {"userName": "L13_Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16304097-l13-natasha", "userReview": "Walter Dean Myers nevers disappoints. His account of a young American soldier facing the enemy in combat is emotional, intense, and frightening. This soldier's story is not told from moment to moment but rather emotion to emotion. Desiring a reason to kill the enemy, the soldier struggles with his plight but remains steadfast in his desire to stay alive.  We stare across the distance. I know he wants me to lift my rifle, to be the enemy. I want him to lift his rifle. I want him to turn away. In a heartbeat, we have learned too much about each other.The story addresses the tradegy of the Vietnam War: the difficult terrian, the involvement of civilians, and the dropping of bombs. This book is intense. The reading level is listed as third grade, but the content is really more appropriate for older readers. It certainly provides a first person account of war.

I am in love with the fact that this story is told in poem format and the illustrations really enhance the text with relevant details. While it doesn't get too graphic. it truly portrays what fighting in the Vietnam War was like for some soldiers. This is an excellent pairing for Myers's Fallen Angels due to the same subject matter and the fact that it offers the same basic ideas in a different format while including illustrations. This would be an excellent alternative book to Fallen Angels for students who A) couldn't handle the language and graphic nature of Fallen Angels or B) couldn't handle the length of the novel. This gets the same idea across as Fallen Angels in a much shorter more visual manner. I will definitely buy this book for the collection if I end up in a middle or high school library. This is one book, however, that I would not include in an elementary school collection.Official Review:Title of Resource: Patrol: An American Soldier in VietnamType of Resource: Picture Book \u2013 Pair for Fallen AngelsComplete Citation: Myers, W.

AND Virginia/USHistory VUS.13b) The student will demonstrate knowledge of United States foreign policy since World War II by the describing\u2026the American role in wars in Korea and Vietnam.Student/Teacher Description:I would put this book in the hands of a Language Arts or Social Studies teacher whose students are studying the Vietnam War and want an easy resource to supplement the study of the war or spur creative writing. This book offers a personalized view of what the war was like for a soldier and is written in verse instead of prose. I could also collaborate with language arts or social studies teachers to provide them additional resources on poetry, the Vietnam War, or activities for differentiated instruction either in the library or in the classroom.Paragraph Version:Patrol offers a truthful view of what life was like for soldiers during the Vietnam War using details and illustrations. Walter Dean Myers served in Vietnam and his brother was killed there. He experienced many events that help him accurately portray a soldier\u2019s life during that time. This would be a worthwhile picture book to use during the study of the Vietnam War in Social Studies or in 11th grade English when studying American Literature. The rawness of emotions and simplicity of text make this an excellent addition to the study of a serious time in history. This would be appropriate for an honors class, regular class, or remedial class, since it presents a difficult subject in simple poetry but could inspire a range of assignments. This book may be too intense for some students who are from war-torn areas or whose parents are deployed or part of the military. While Patrol doesn\u2019t explain the whole war, it offers a deep look into one soldier\u2019s experiences while on patrol in the jungles of Vietnam by explaining the boy\u2019s feelings and actions. The illustrations offer students a detailed look into the events and surroundings in Vietnam during war time. The writing is gripping, typical of Myers\u2019s style. This is one of the few high school picture books that portray the Vietnam War experience. Appropriate for all levels of students, Patrol stands out as a welcome addition to any library to be enjoyed by students as well as Language Arts and Social Studies teachers.

The soldier is both tired and afraid as he waits and begins to try to understand the enemy as people like him. The text reads like poetry flow and description. Ann Grifalconi's collage illustrations complement the setting and the soldier's feelings.

The young soldier narrating the poem is very frank about his fear, about killing and about death. His view of \u201cthe enemy\u201d changes over the course of the text, beginning with \u201che is the harvest\u201d to episodes of wondering if the enemy is doing and feeling the same things he is. At the point when the speaker begins to humanize the Vietnamese in this way, he admits to being tired of war. Grifalconi\u2019s collage type illustrations provide a beautiful setting for Myers\u2019 text. The illustrations highlight the dichotomy between the beauty of the landscape and the horrors of war. While many aspects of the illustrations are somewhat fantastical and brighter than life, the faces of both the American soldiers (African American, mostly) and the Vietnamese are realistic, probably photographs.\tA few reviews that I saw listed the age range for this book as low as 5 years old. I completely disagree. Even though it is a picture book, I would probably not use it until upper elementary or even middle school. In fact, this book could still be part of a high school curriculum when teaching about Vietnam. (At my local library this was shelved with the children\u2019s chapter books, not with the picture books, which I think was appropriate.)"}, {"userName": "Teeny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3170569-teeny", "userReview": "Summary: A young American soldier waits for his enemy, rifle in hand, finger on the trigger.

This story doesn't go into detail about the war, but it doesn't need to. Instead, this story demonstrates the fear of a soldier during this war and the inner struggles fighting within, one of the most prevalent being \"Who is the enemy?\". Several times throughout the story, the soldier thinks if his \"enemy\" is doing similar things as him. One of the most interesting parts of the story is when the American soldiers enter a village and surround the \"enemies\", who consist of women, farmers, elders and crying babies. At the end of the story, the main character is shown writing a letter and saying \"I am so very tired of this war\". This story is powerful because it avoids showing the soldier as a fearless hero, but instead as a young man who is confused and afraid.Classroom Use:One of the things I loved about this book is that it is such a low reading level, but covers very powerful themes and content. This book would be a great read aloud to include in a history unit about the Vietnam war or any wars. I believe that a lot of powerful conversations could come out of this text and I think it could be used as a great catalyst to discuss more serious themes that this book presents."}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3160278-jessica", "userReview": "Summary: A young American soldier waits for his enemy, rifle in hand, finger on the trigger.
