In this one, the setting of a small town on the coast of Maine, during a frigid winter, had me turning pages very quickly. A lot of sympathy is generated by Mary, a battered wife, who has left her former life behind. Much nuance is added to the tale by having events described by different characters."}, {"userName": "Lulu", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1400756-lulu", "userReview": "I rarely rate novels 5 stars, yet this one deserves to get 5. A novel by Anita Shreve \u201cStrange Fits of Passion\u201d is so absorbing a story that you simply can\u2019t put the novel down until you finish reading it at one time. A story of a turbulent tragic story of domestic abuse. A woman who is sentenced to a life prison for a first degree murder she did for self-defense against her brutal husband. Unlike other novels that use a lot of \u201cI\u201d and seem to have only one character speaking and playing role the whole story, this novel is different and to tell you the truth the kind of writing she uses in this novel Strange Fits of Passion is new to me. Anita Shreve does not write her novel \u201cStrange Fits of Passion\u201d based on chapters of accidents, yet she writes the story as if you were reading memoirs or testimonials from people who are directly or indirectly related to the main character, so sometimes there are some flashbacks. It is not only ONE character who speaks, yet MORE than ONE. There is even the Reading Group Guide Inside; in this Guide, there are some questions about each character who testifies on Mary Amesbury alias Maureen English. The story might be just usual story, yet the way Anita Shreve tells it to the world make it unusual story and become an interesting story to read. To me, this is a really impressive style of writing that brings to an excellent story, a powerful portrait of truth and deception.ISBN : 0-15-185760-1Lu2Ar"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36632347-lisa", "userReview": "I really really enjoyed this book! It was one of those books that you are sad to say good-bye to.. .you know the ones, the ones where you start savoring the chapters and put off reading the ending because you don't want to part with it! Fortunately, this was a library book so I couldn't employ my usual stall tactics. Don't let the name of the book fool you into thinking this is a hot steamy love story. . .it is not. There are many different types of passion, and not all of them are good. I don't want to give too much away but this book explores the \"psyche\" of the domestic violence victim in a way I have never seen done. There are many different characters in the book, some I loved, and some I couldn't stand, but I felt I had the opportunity to know each and every character. The book is set in Maine in the middle of the winter. The author depicts the city in such a way that I actually felt physically chilly at times as I was reading the book in my humid Texas climate! Wow, now that is what I call a great author! I have read several books by this author and have enjoyed all of them, but I have to say that this one is my favorite so far. Next I'm going to read Sea Glass. In fact, I just checked it out of the library. :-)"}, {"userName": "Laurel", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3259656-laurel", "userReview": "I read this book for a book group, otherwise I would never have chosen a book about domestic violence myself. The story was compelling but I am not a Shreve fan. As in her past books, the characters are unlikable and I feel she is a very manipulative, intrusive author. The characters feel like puppets on a stage; I never feel transported by the writing. In this case, the narrative is intentionally disjointed because the bulk of the story is related in a series of writings and interviews by the major and minor players in the tragedy. These versions of the truth are then distorted by a reporter into an expose that makes her career. I found the take-away message depressing and at odds with my opinion of human nature. The characters were unable to overcome their base desires which seems to be excused in some way by their personal circumstances or time in which they lived (ca. 1970, for goodness' sake). I prefer to believe that even in the worst circumstances people have some control over their actions and are only doomed when they give up on themselves. No one in this sorry tale is able to rise to the challenge: a very sad commentary indeed."}, {"userName": "Gale Martin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/142801-gale-martin", "userReview": "I wish I had read this before I began writing creatively because it is so instructive, and I was really intrigued by her craft--the method she used to unravel this tale. Pacing and revelation in this work are everything a reader expects from this author. While I love her penchant of teasing out only what readers need to know to stay engrossed in the story, her main characters are always somewhat thin. I couldn't relate to her protagonists though I did feel for the battered woman. I just didn't get her. And of course Shreve's books are unrelentingly sad. Would it kill the author to throw in an affirming ending once in a while? (Yes, I think it would. Just not her style.)Yet, she draws attention to an important social ill without being preachy. I inhaled this book rather than read it. Definitely a good read, even if I saw where it was headed, even if she was a little stingy in the character development."}, {"userName": "Gabi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 05, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/944811-gabi", "userReview": "Curious book. Up until the last 30 pages, I thought this was very compelling. Then, it felt like Shreve did a quick wrap-up that included a lot of explanation of how society didn't understand abuse in the 1970s. But we all know that, and many writers have written much better on the topic. In addition, the bits about the reporter in the end were shallow and felt like they'd been thrown in for a twist. But I didn't buy them at all. It felt totally tacked on. POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT? Finally, supposedly at trial, nobody could corroborate the abuse. But earlier in the book there was a mention of a neighbor who appeared concerned and made halting comments about hearing noises. Shreve needed at least a sentence stating that the neighbor couldn't be located for trial. Otherwise, a lack of mention blows the idea of no witnesses to the abuse. Small point, I know, but it was easily fixed with a smarter edit."}, {"userName": "Bookfanatic", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4398710-bookfanatic", "userReview": "This isn't the Anita Shreve book I'd recommend to others. I didn't enjoy reading this emotionally unsatisfying story filled with alcoholism, domestic violence and other forms of violence. On the surface, the Ivy League educated husband and wife have an ideal marriage, but as we all know appearances can be deceiving. The story, which is set in the late 1960 or early 1970s, follows a sequence of events set mostly in a small cold town in Maine filled with a cast of colorful characters that you'd find in small cold Maine towns. I skimmed parts of the book just to see what happens at the end although you can tell from the first couple of pages what the ending is likely to be since the story starts off from the adult daughter's perspective. I'd recommend \"The Last Time They Met\" if you want to read one of Shreve's best works of fiction."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "The story of the dreadful marriage is presented twice - first by the escaping wife and then by the reporter who wrote the ensuing glossy magazine article. These two versions are presented to the daughter of the wife 20 years later, and the whole idea - I think - is to show how our views about this nasty subject have changed, and how repulsive the attitudes of the early 1970s were towards women in this situation.  That's not a bad idea for a novel, but Anita Shreve spends such a lot of time painting the setting and atmosphere in thick slabs of local colour (winter in a Maine fishing village) that what seems to be the main point of the thing loses focus. She spends pages on the dull stuff and a couple of lines on the interesting stuff.

The article in question revolves around a murder case that took place in St Hilaire. We are offered a series of insights into the motives of the characters and most importantly, the central character, Mary, or Maureen as she was known; she assumed a new identity as she sought to escape from her violent husband. The writing is amazing, especially the change of pace as the character goes from a bustling New York to the quieter lobster town.

The novel takes place in 1971, twenty years prior. It is told from the perspective of several individuals acquainted with the main character, Maureen English, aka Mary Amesbury, fleeing from an abusive husband, taking her infant daughter with her. She stops in a small coastal town in Maine for the night at a motel and signs in as Mary Amesbury. It is below freezing weather. She then decides to rent a small cheap cottage and stay until she can figure out what to do with very little cash that was in her husbands pocket when she abruptly took flight. She needs a few groceries and stops at the only place available in town, picks up a coffee cake, milk and a 6-pack of beer. An odd selection, I thought. She is a nursing mother, so the beer gave me pause, not to mention it\u2019s freezing outside. Coffee anyone? I then remembered that this is the 70s and the no-drinking rule for nursing mothers wasn\u2019t yet as well focused on as it is today. She evidently didn\u2019t worry about it anyway, as through-out the novel she partook in hard liquor as well. The proprietor of the store is also the only law-enforcement the town has. He notices her bruised face and cut lips. She says she was in a car accident, but that\u2019s just the beginning to this complex story. I won\u2019t say more. Read it. I\u2019ve had this in my personal library for some time but hadn\u2019t read it as I find the topic of domestic violence hard and depressing to read at times. Knowing Shreve\u2019s talents I was sure it would offer more than standard fare in this genre. Page one however, should have been sub-titled \u201cHelen.\u201d Her other chapters were sub-titled by the person\u2019s perspective of the main character. I thought I was reading comments by the author Shreve because it refers to books she has written and why, but no, it is the novel. The story opens with Helen, a journalist, an investigative reporter, who has gathered notes and information for an article and a book about what went on in the case of Maureen/Mary, who at the opening of the novel is in jail. It goes into what her life was like before coming to St. Hilaire, Maine and how her short residency ultimately affected many of the local towns-people. After you figure that out, you get the rhythm of the writing as it unfolds from past to present. One thing that bothered me was the summary towards the end referred to as \u201cthe article\u201d entitled (in the Maine dialect) as \u201cThe Killing Over to the Point\u201d written by Helen Scofield. This is a 19 page summary of everything you\u2019ve already read, which I admittedly had a tendency to skim through until I figured out it had a way of swaying the reader as to what actually was true and what may have not been. It begs to open your mind in question. Appropriately in this day and age of leniencies taken by the press. It gives the reader a good realization of how reporting can influence, sway and determine the outcome of certain situations. The ending did bring some surprises, some closure and a gratefulness for the support of abused women in today\u2019s climate. A very good read. I\u2019m glad I dusted it off my library shelf."}, {"userName": "Heather Walls", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3783718-heather-walls", "userReview": "Just as I have with most of her works, I flew right into the world of this story, away from the here \u2013 the very thing every novel hopes to accomplish. Her writing is the kind we fall asleep holding. The kind that has us bargaining with ourselves. \"Just 10 more pages, then I\u2019ll ...\" Before we know it, 10 have turned to 20, 20 to 50, and 50 to the epilogue.I can now proudly say I\u2019ve read every book Anita Shreve has authored. Though first published 20 years ago, the style in Strange Fits of Passion is what first drew me to her writing, and, after reading Rescue, which was a deviation from this celebrated style, I was grateful to have a respite to her early days.I was never a great fan of the title, both before and after. It\u2019s possible that is why I put off the reading of it for so long. Oddly enough, one line within the book, at the end of a paragraph in which the victim and protagonist is describing her approach to reporting, aptly captures my feelings about title, while, in its brevity, cuts immediately to the story\u2019s core.\"[The] quotes, though accurate, would sound prosaic, seldom witty, and, even if important, rarely intriguing. Such people would want to disown their quotes. I would, of course, have my notes. I could tell them, if they asked: This had been put just this way; that word had, indeed been used. And yet I knew exactly what it was they objected to. What had been written wasn\u2019t what they had meant to say at all.\"Even though the title is lifted directly from the William Wordsworth poem about his beloved Lucy, it fails to capture the grit and tenderness of the story, which Shreve reprised again in Testimony. Perhaps, though I only speculate, this non sequitur was exactly her intention.Using interviews, a form of casual testimony, Shreve dangles carrots, quasi-ambiguous nuggets that explain tight spots yet simultaneously introduce others. It is precisely this device that causes her readers to believe they have reached a natural stopping place but instead they find themselves sitting atop a catapult. Who could rest there?I certainly didn\u2019t, and finished this in record time, under a week. Although I was on vacation in North Carolina near the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains, since the story so easily transported me, it\u2019s likely, had I read the book during a routine week, I would have still felt miles away."}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1269529-cynthia", "userReview": "This book was about truth.

The \"facts\" can be presented 2 different ways, or by 2 different people, and have 2 different outcomes. This is nothing new, it happens all the time. Everyone can see things differently. It also shows how a person can intentionally relay the \"facts\" with a choice of words to influence, or proselytize to their own advantage. Journalists are meant to report the facts, and yet this story demonstrates how deeply the manipulating of the truth to shape another's future, can effect the indivduals of the tragedy. It was sad to see how someone could use that information to further their own career, disregarding the effects on the people who were most altered by the aftermath. This book also showed me that if you aren't honest with yourself and the people around you, you are the one to blame if you are later misunderstood. Just as Maureen put up with her husband's sexual requests in the begining without difiance, it lead her down a path of much more serious consequences, one that inevitably gave her no other choices, even when her sole purpose in life was to protect her daughter from pain, that was ultimately the lasting result."}, {"userName": "Chana", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1400289-chana", "userReview": "Maureen English is a 26 year old up and coming reporter who becomes involved with a fellow reporter.

She takes on a new name and identity as Mary Amesbury. If Mary's husband is boxing her in, Anita Shreve is certainly boxing us readers in as well. I sympathized with Mary but I didn't see her making choices that would be in her best interest or the interest of her child. She wanted too many things; not to have to run any more, to be in love even when the circumstances made that a bad choice, to keep her secrets from those who may have been able to help her. If the Real Estate motto is location, the Social Services motto is document. She couldn't document her case whatsoever. She was also weak in a way that I found self-destructive. I mean what was with letting that guy Willis act like he could just come and go?

The story is told from different points of view - people in the town - how she fares and the aftermath of a tragedy(s). Maureen is complicated and I don't want to spoil it, but what we think we know about her in the beginning may not be true. There is probably no truth here, only what is perceived and how Maureen is judged, as a battered woman in 1971.

It moves its action forward pretty briskly, but it also imparts insight into character motivation, especially by changing narrator from character to character - Shreve creates distinct voices for them. The retelling of the story from a journalist's viewpoint is cleverly done, and including the journalist's version as a plot device rounds it off nicely - the rounding off is too neat, too pat to be believable, but that is exactly the point. As for the objection that it's morally ambiguous about violence against women, that being of its time is no excuse, compare this with the success of Fifty Shades of Grey two short decades later, and tell me times don't change. Shreve clearly knows her locale well, and indeed her previous profession as a magazine journalist. And she appears to have the same red-gold hair as her protagonist ... A small quibble re plot - why did no-one think back to when the antagonist threatened to kill her, in so many words? Not the central character, not her lawyer, not the judge.
