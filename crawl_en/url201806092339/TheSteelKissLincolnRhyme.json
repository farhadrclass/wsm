I shouldn't have. And prior to that, I hadn't picked up a Jeffrey Deaver book in years, for no particular reason, I just hadn't.It did take me a little time to get into, but once I was into it, I was into it! Deaver rarely disappoints, and he certainly didn't here. He takes what you think you know, and turns it on its head. This was an entertaining, almost exhilarating read with plenty of twists and turns, plenty of breath-taking moments. It is also a book that makes you stop and think about our consumer-based society and our reliance on technology.I can see I am going to have to go back and read the books in this series that I haven't yet read. Now that I have again had a taste of Deaver's writing, I find that I have missed his style.Thank you to Grand Central Publishing via NetGalley for providing a digital ARC of The Steel Kiss by Jeffrey Deaver in exchange for an honest review.

But nerveless, it felt really good to return to this series since I like the main characters so much. There is some friction between Amelia and Lincoln in this book. She is upset that he has quit the force to work as a teacher, and she also has some personal problems with her mother being ill. Lincoln has taken on a Juliette Archer as an intern, and I was a bit worried Deaver was setting up this to be some kind of love-triangle. And, then Nick Carelli, Amelia ex-boyfriend showed up in the story, and I was really worried this would turn into a love drama. But I needed not worry.

In each book we are able to watch an unusual and enterprising criminal murder some of New York\u2019s inhabitants - often in bizarre and clever ways - whilst Rhyme and his crew analyse data and trace evidence in an attempt to track him or her down. Rhyme is a former forensic analyst with the NYPD and the police now hire him to support their efforts when they believe the addition his skills are likely to be particularly advantageous to their investigations. In his endeavours he is routinely supported by Thom (his carer), Mel Cooper (NYPD forensic analyst) and Lon Sellitto (NYPD homicide detective). Fans of this series will be used to the byplay between these characters; the technical debates regarding the sifting of minute particles of soil or fluid edging them ever closer to the vital finding.The crew all feature here but from the start two new elements are introduced:1. Rhyme is no longer working on criminal cases \u2013 he\u2019s quit! His time is now spent lecturing on his area of expertise. And a new character is introduced, a second wheelchair bound sleuth who he has agreed to mentor. Will this all end in tears?2. The ex-lover of Sachs makes an appearance, fresh out of the clink. He professes he never did the crime. Is he to be trusted?Quite how these elements knit together I\u2019ll not divulge, but suffice to say it\u2019s a satisfying mix. It\u2019s also good to see a variation on what can at times be quite a samey series. Certainly the new faces and the added complexities they bring to the story liven up the book. But the real interest and enjoyment for me is in the discussion, the banter between the brusque Rhyme and his cohorts. It\u2019s clever and often funny and I love the way Deaver gives the reader just enough information to allow us to be surprised and impressed by Rhyme\u2019s deductions.It\u2019s a worthy addition to the series and I\u2019d even go as far to say it\u2019s a book that might draw in some readers who have become jaded by the somewhat repetitive nature of the books. I hope it does and I, for one, can\u2019t wait for the next instalment.

I wasn't sure what to expect, but I was pleasantly surprised. I thought that The Steel Kiss started off a little slowly, but when the crimes link together and Rhyme and Sach's join forces, I became hooked. The novel is packed with surprising twists and revelations. Be forewarned, there are some gory moments! I didn't feel lost having never read a Lincoln Rhyme mystery; however, I do have several questions that I think will be answered if I read the earlier books in the series. I cannot wait to read the next book in the series! I highly recommend!

He didn't follow up on events from the last one, he had Sachs and Rhyme at odds for \"tension\" and introduced one new character and someone we heard about just to make us readers think could Sachs and Rhyme be done. It was eyeroll inducing because it wasn't even believable. And to start off with Rhyme feeling guilty about a case so much he is done working for the NYPD wasn't to be believed. This book felt light on evidence and also Rhyme may need a body guard due to the constant criminals breaking into his home to off him.The 12th book in the Lincoln Rhyme series rivals \"The Empty Chair\" for my least favorite at this point. Maybe because none of the characters were shown well in this one. The book starts off with Amelia Sachs being very angry, we don't find out why for a while, but when we do, we find it's because Lincoln Rhyme has decided that he will no longer consult on NYPD cases and he's going to go off and teach. Now it takes a long winding road to get there, but we find out on the last case that Rhyme worked on somebody who appeared to be innocent ended up going to jail for a case that he was working on. I don't know, I just didn't find it believable that Rhyme, who has been an a******* throughout this whole series decides he's just not going to do cases anymore. And don't even get me started on the fact that we just ignore how something that Rhyme did previously in this past (The Bone Collector) ended up affecting his present. Deaver doesn't even call that back to why Rhyme may be gun shy.So Sachs is looking for an unsub who is suspected of a couple of violent crimes. That all gets thrown into the wind when a man on escalator gets trapped and killed due to the machinery malfunctioning.So Sachs leaves that case to Rhyme with him pulling in one of his student's to assist. Cue tension, this student is smart, attractive, and also in a wheelchair. Cue plot point you start to have Rhyme thinking of her. I don't know, I think Deaver's thinks that we're too stupid to realize that these characters that we get introduced to in this book are red herrings. At no point was I concerned that Rhyme is going to fall in love with his student because they have a similar disability. Nor was it a concern when Sach's ex-boyfriend Nick finally gets out of jail coming to her to plead his innocent.There were at least three, possibly four distinct plots in this one and none of them hung together very well. And then when things somehow loop together it was just a joke.I feel like if Deaver really wanted to touch upon Sach's and her relationship with her ex maybe that would have made for a good short story. I just really don't buy that all the stuff that was going on. And per usual Deaver just pulls out of his butt something to just hinder Sach's in her career. I don't know just made me roll my eyes it was really dumb it didn't make any sense and just kind of just happens.We get the usual suspects in this one Pulaski, Lon, and also our favorite FBI agent Delray.I was happy though to see some call back to what Lon went through in the last book but other than that there's very little continuity besides a couple references here and there that you might not realize unless you're a longtime reader.The setting in this New York feels artificial and sterile at times. I don't know, I just really miss Deaver who used to go into the history of a thing, a city, a street, a chemical, etc. and it was very light on the foresnics in this one.Even the criminal in this this one wasn't that very interesting and I was bored by all sections of the book that delved into his point of view. He just felt unnecessary considering everything else that was going on.So in the book and we're giving I think what Deaver considers a startling revelation about a new change in Sach's and Rhyme's relationship. I just felt very annoyed and just cheated because I definitely think we should have gotten that scene and not heard about it told to us via them telling it to a third character."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2172096-barbara", "userReview": "3.5 starsThis is the 12th book in the 'Lincoln Rhyme' series, but can be read as a standalone without missing much. As the story opens, quadriplegic, forensic criminalist Lincoln Rhyme has given up being a police consultant and is teaching forensics. One of Rhyme's students - thirtyish, wheelchair-bound Juliette Archer - asks to be his intern, and Rhyme agrees.Meanwhile, Rhyme's professional partner/girlfriend, NYPD Detective Amelia Sachs, is on the trail of a murderer called Unsub 40. Sachs spots Unsub 40 on the street and follows him into a mall, where the perp orders lunch in a coffee shop. Amelia is watching the Unsub and waiting for backup when loud screams erupt from the escalator - which has popped open and swallowed a man named Greg Frommer. When Amelia rushes over to help doomed Frommer - who's practically bisected by the escalator machinery - Unsub 40 disappears.After learning that Frommer's widow and young son are almost destitute, Amelia convinces Lincoln to help an attorney file a civil suit against the escalator company and anyone else who might be liable. Intern Juliette helps Lincoln research grounds for the lawsuit.Every book in this series features a clever perp who has some bizarre modus operandi. In this book it's Unsub 40, who's learned to sabotage devices that use 'smart' computer technology, like escalators, elevators, cars, industrial machines, household appliances, etc. (Imagine your electric carving knife suddenly attacking you!) The Unsub is determined to get revenge against 'Shoppers', and takes credit for each of his kills, calling himself 'The People's Guardian.' Parts of the book are told from Unsub 40's point of view, which provides insight into his thinking and history.As things play out Lincoln's inquiries for the civil suit dovetail with Amelia's hunt for Unsub 40, and the duo (plus Juliette) collaborate on the forensic analysis of evidence such as dust and debris at crime scenes; glass fragments; wood splinters; furniture glaze; food wrappers and napkins (the Unsub loves White Castle hamburgers); and so on.There's plenty of excitement as Unsub 40 tries to elude the cops, who are close on his trail. An added element of suspense is the killer's girlfriend, an apparent survivor of domestic abuse, who seems to be in danger from the Unsub.There are a couple of subplots to add to the excitement. Amelia's former boyfriend, ex-cop Nick Carelli, has been in prison for robbery and assault. Released after five years, Nick claims he was coerced into confessing, and implores Amelia to help him clear his name. And Officer Ron Pulaski - who sustained a serious head injury in the line of duty - is secretly trying to buy a powerful new street drug from gangbangers. In Deaver's thrillers things are not always as they appear, and I wondered about what was really going on. I also thought there might be a rearrangement of romantic partners: Lincoln and Juliette? Amelia and Nick? Lots to speculate about as I sped through the book.I enjoyed this fast moving suspense thriller but was a little disappointed with the denoument, which was rather abrupt (....all of a sudden the perp is in custody!). Still, a good addition to the series. Highly recommended to mystery fans.You can follow my reviews at http://reviewsbybarbsaffer.blogspot.com/"}, {"userName": "Christy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16154349-christy", "userReview": "The Steel Kiss is the title of the manifesto of a domestic terrorist, a man who is brutally murdering those he calls \"Shoppers\" by using the intelligent data chips in their own consumer appliances against them and sending rants to the newspapers about materialism and greed. It's a harrowing thought, when I look around me at all the appliances in my own home that have the potential to be misused - let along going outside. Cars, elevators, escalators, buses, trains, planes, the equipment I use at work, computers, microwaves, ovens, heating - I am surrounded by technology and so are those targeted by the killer. The way in which he kills is chilling and disturbing, since he also delights in causing pain, and watching suffering. Forensic scientist Lincoln Rhyme and detective Amelia Sachs must analyze the clues, and attempt to get into the mind of the killer, before he can kill again.Returning to Sachs and Rhyme is a delight for me, as I am a big fan of the series (this is the twelfth book) and all the characters within. I already know that I love Deaver's writing style, but for those new to the series, you'll find fast paced action, intellectual and witty dialogue and realistic, detailed investigative procedures and science - without ever leaning towards being boring. You could read this book as a standalone, but there is so much history, character and backstory in this series, I'd strongly recommend reading at least the first book in the series, \"The Bone Collector\" first.The Steel Kiss manages to be creepy, suspenseful and action packed, with twists and turns and then more twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat. It also wove in the complexities of the continuing relationship between Amelia and Lincoln, brought back an old character in the form of Amelia's ex, Nick Carelli who is asking for her help in proving he was innocent of the crime he just did time for, and a vibrant new character in the form of Juliette Archer, Lincoln's new intern.

It soon appears that it may not have been an accident and he leads the search of a serial killer who is turning everyday appliances into deadly weapons.

What I like about Jeffery Deaver is that he is never afraid to push the boundaries for a thriller. He is most certainly one of the best plotters in the world. He is a master at keeping us on the edge of our seats. Every book that Jeffery Deaver writes he delivers a new topic, that what makes him such a good author. Amelia Sachs had been driving when she spotted the suspect. The suspect who beaten to death his victim, didn't know there was a witness. He was now entering a five-story shopping center. What was the suspect doing in a shopping center? He wasn't getting away not this time Amelia Sachs planned to take him in Starbucks but he wasn't there. A piercing scream from on the top of the escalator a man was trapped in the gears of the motor. The gears dug deep into his body, suffering in his last fifteen minutes on earth.

Deaver seems to feel that he needs to constantly employ writing tricks to keep the reader interested. In this novel, that meant multiple incidents of failing to reveal the true motivations and actions of characters, even when they acted as narrators.

But for some reason, this one hit just a titch off the bullseye, prompting me to issue a slightly lower rating (to be more precise, 4.5 stars, which isn't possible here).I can't put my finger on a reason, except perhaps that Rhyme has stopped working on NYPD criminal cases - much to the dismay of his professional and personal partner, Amelia Sachs. Now, they lead almost separate lives, and Sachs is less than thrilled. Complicating the issue is the return of her ex-boyfriend, who's been in jail for a crime he insists he did not commit and wants Amelia to help him prove it (and in the process come back to him). Add in more complications with the introduction of an intern hell-bent on pleasing Rhyme: A young, attractive, intelligent woman who, like Rhyme, is in a wheelchair.The book begins as Sachs is on one of her famous chases, this time to nail a killer as he runs through a Brooklyn department store. Just as she's closing in, she's distracted by screams: The maintenance cover on a working escalator, it seems, has inexplicably opened and a passenger has fallen in and landed on the still-running gears. She abandons her chase, opting instead to try to save - unsuccessfully - the accident victim.But was it an accident? If not, how on earth could the escalator cover have popped open all by itself? As it turns out, the NYPD has a serial killer on its hands - one who apparently has the ability to take control of \"smart\" technology that's become commonplace in today's society. Throughout, the specter of just how safe we all are from the \"stuff\" we all want and claim to need but over which we really have little control hangs over our heads. By the end, I was giving serious thought to disconnecting everything from my Kindle to my garage-door opener.As usual, the action is almost nonstop as Rhyme and Sachs and their teams are brought together by commonalities in the cases on which they're working. Also as usual, there were a few almost-chuckles, usually stemming from Rhyme's droll sense of humor. In one of his classroom sessions, for instance - he's now spending some time teaching - he welcomes a student who claims to be a novelist because he (Rhyme) once was the subject of a \"series of novels based on cases he'd run.\" In fact, he muses, he even wrote the author to complain about \"misrepresentations of real crime work...\"The plot notwithstanding, I'd really, really love to know how much the manufacturer of well-known outdoor wear (e.g., jackets) has paid publishers (and/or authors) for product placement. It's not just in this book; I've seen mentions in several books of late - one of which hammered the brand name home in at least 20 places. Actually, it's not a bad idea; unlike TV commercials that can be zapped through with recording devices or ignored via trips to the refrigerator, readers are pretty much captive sets of eyes. But doggone it, hold enough; more than one or two mentions is intrusive and, at least by me, not appreciated."}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "I love Lincoln Rhyme. It is a series I have been in from the start, never missed one, never been disappointed although as with any series it has had its ups and downs and my favourite is still \u201cThe Vanished Man\u201d even after all these years \u2013 with The Steel Kiss Jeffrey Deaver is on top form once more though and I thoroughly enjoyed this one and inhaled it in a couple of sittings.Here Lincoln has retired from the criminal side of things (WHAT? I hear you cry \u2013 do not fear, he just can\u2019t help himself) but when Amelia asks him to use his particular talents in a civil case he gets caught up in a race against time against a formidable killer.I like these because of the forensic angle, done so well in a fascinating way every time, in this case with bells on as Jeffrey Deaver brings a slightly different focus to things and adds in a new character who I grew very fond of. As well as the case in hand we have Ron getting INTO trouble, Amelia running around the streets looking FOR trouble and the usual fast paced mayhem interspersed with the science and technology. Its a great mix and makes for a great read, giving your brain cells a workout and your heart a bit of a run for its money.I especially enjoyed the \u201ckiller\u201d asides, an intriguing look into an intriguing mind, but as always Lincoln is the character that fascinates the most, especially his relationships with those around him, with every novel the insight gets deeper and still he can be unexpected.A great cast of characters and some great storytellling.

Jeffery Deaver sometimes goes astray like in some of the Kathryn Dance mystery novels like the horrible ones about country music/folk music characters and even a recording of some really bad music. It distracts from the mystery and the music stuff is just goofy. This is in his Lincoln Rhyme/Amelia Sachs series which I like better. In this story, Amelia is ticked off that Lincoln has sworn off doing criminal work as a consultant for the NYPD after a death he blames himself for. Lincoln had been an NYPD detective until an accident while on site at a crime made him into a paraplegic from the neck down. He lives in a New York townhouse with his caregiver Thom, a gay man who is sweet, funny and a great cook as well as a capable caregiver. He has a whole police center set up there and Amelia and other officers work there in his high tech set up. The whole thing is so cool! He and Amelia are in love, a couple, and engaged. Anyway, Amelia is tracking an unsub (unidentified suspect) into a mall and about to grab him at Starbucks when there is a horrifying accident. A man steps off the escalator only to have the top non-movable step open up and he falls in and is being cut in half. Amelia abandons her unsub and jumps in and has to shoot the motor to make it stop as it is ripping the man up. The man, knowing he is dying, makes her promise to go tell his wife and little boy he loves them.The man dies and Amelia, never good in emotional situations, goes to the house and discovers the man's wife and son have nothing but a dump, no more income, no insurance, and are about to have to go live in a relative's garage. She asks a lawyer to help and soon the lawyer is asking Lincoln to help with the civil lawsuit.This is where things get interesting. It turns out that the accident wasn't an accident. The unsub is a clever killer working for someone who wanted the man dead and others dead as well. They are killed by a ball peen hammer and also by the unsub hacking into to smart devices like escalators and stoves and other high tech appliances and causing them to kill people. So now Lincoln's and Amelia's cases get intertwined and we meet Juliette- Lincoln's student and now his intern- who is also in a wheelchair. Its all very exciting and we watch as Lincoln, Amelia, Juliette and the team try to catch a killer who doesn't leave clues."}, {"userName": "Eve Nolon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33592909-eve-nolon", "userReview": "Three full stars but at least one half star is due to the exclusion of Pam.

Yes, I am a confirmed bookaholic and proud of it. Given that, it\u2019s always surprising to me when I realize I haven\u2019t read an acclaimed author\u2019s work. Jeffery Deaver is a prime example of that. He\u2019s probably one of our top international bestselling authors, with lots of awards and with over 30 highly successful novels under his belt. The man is considered a master at crime novels. I even saw The Bone Collector when it was made into a film. Don\u2019t ask me how his novels slipped past me. I\u2019ve seen them on my local bookstore shelf many times but then another novel would sing its siren song at me and, although I\u2019d only intend to turn away for a second, I\u2019d wander off in a bookaholic daze. Sad but true.I\u2019ve finally corrected that problem by reading The Steel Kiss, the latest in his forensic detective series featuring Lincoln Rhyme. Before you get concerned that this novel is deep into the series, let me reassure you that I had no problem reading it as a stand-alone. I probably missed some of the continuing thread/backstory elements; however, it worked quite well. There was only one thread I had an issue with and I\u2019m going to clear that one up for you in this review since it becomes apparent before the novel ends \u2013 and I can do that without providing spoilers. So if you like Bones or other forensic TV series, police procedurals, detective stories, crime stories, thrillers or psychological thrillers then hang onto your seats because have I got a read for you!

There Rhyme had had too much evidence and parsed it too carefully. Perhaps in the Unsub 40 situation he'd missed some clue in prior scenes that might have pointed to the Abe Benkoff's apartment as the site of a future attack. And he experienced the unnerving hollowness he'd felt when he learned of the businessman's death. The uneasiness and, okay, guilt that had prompted his decision to end his career as a criminal forensic investigator....\"Amelia is searching for a serial killer. She knows vaguely what he looks like-but he evades her. He's amused that the pretty red head is after him. He has no plans on letting her slow him down. Meanwhile, retired police Captain Lincoln Rhyme, a quadriplegic, is teaching classes on crime scene analysis. One student, Juliette Archer, is going to be part of his new team and his new intern. Lincoln and Amelia consult with each other, along with a personal relationship. Being disabled in body only, Lincoln continues his police work where he can. Amelia asks for his help on a special case to help what appears to be an accident victims family. Lincoln and Juliette concentrate on the escalator accident that left a man cut nearly in half and his family penniless. Can they find enough evidence to help this family?Amelia continues her hunt and a game of cat and mouse ensues. The game that can lead to more dead bodies. What happens if it turns out the escalator accident was actually a murder? The killer is figuring out ways to his work with things you'd think were an accident at first look. Complications continue as someone from Amelia's past arrives with claims of innocence. What if the killer has found a way to spread his evil to bigger levels? Can this team of investigators find this domestic terrorist and stop him? As all Jeffrey Deaver novels, his story lines are interesting, and connected in ways that keep you fascinated. This author is good at leading you down a familiar road only to take a quick turn into a surprising whole other direction. Being the 12th in the \"Lincoln Rhyme\" series, you'll find it is still a fast paced, page turning adventure. A scary story for our technological times.Thank you Netgalley and Grand Central :Publishing"}, {"userName": "Karyn Niedert", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11768919-karyn-niedert", "userReview": "RELEASE DATE: March 08, 2016RATING: 4 Stars Definitely a book worth reading\u2026GENRE: Thriller/Mystery & SuspenseAUDIENCE: Fans of Jonathan Kellerman, John Sandford, Cody McFadyen, and previous Jeffery Deaver novels will truly enjoy \u201cThe Steel Kiss\u201dSERIES: Lincoln Rhyme seriesREVIEW: I\u2019ve been a big fan of Jeffery Deaver novels since I was in my early twenties. His writing style makes the unanticipated twists at the end seem like they came out of nowhere, without feeling a reader cheated. He lays out the clues, and allows reader\u2019s imaginations to run wild with the whodunit/whydunit until the last pages of his books. \u201cThe Steel Kiss\u201d meets with my high expectations from a Deaver novel, and has me more intrigued than ever as to how the relationship between Rhyme and Sachs will progress. \u201cThe Steel Kiss\u201d begins with Amelia Sachs chasing a murder suspect through a busy mall. Once she has him trapped, a nearby escalator malfunctions with dire consequences for one of the passengers. Sachs attempts a rescue, and loses her murderous prey. Thus begins a harrowing game of cat and mouse that leads Sachs and Rhyme into the dark machinations of a murderer who is using consumer\u2019s love of high-end appliances against them.\u201cKiss\u201d hums with an intensity that shows that Deaver truly wants to deliver a great story for his fans. Some authors seem to publish \u2018gotta fulfill my contractual obligations\u2019 stinkers that don\u2019t measure up to the author\u2019s reputation. This is NOT the case with \u201cThe Steel Kiss\u201d. As a matter of point, I would say that this is one of Deaver\u2019s better recent novels."}, {"userName": "Shirley Schwartz", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4278399-shirley-schwartz", "userReview": "I found this book a bit long, and the side stories didn't really add to the original story. But this is Jeffery Deaver and he know-how to write a thriller. I love Jeffery Deaver's Lincoln Rhyme series usually. For those that don't follow the series, Lincoln Rhyme is an ex-NYPD captain who was injured in a shootout. That injury left him a quadriplegic, and he has since devoted his life to pursing justice as a highly trained criminalist. Along with his paramour Amelia Sachs, his caregiver Thom and various other law enforcement people on his highly specialized team, he manages to solve some of the truly difficult more crimes. But Jeffery Deaver is wordy, and so it is in this book. The detail from the crime scene evidence and the psychic insight into the \"perp\" are both extensive. They are after a particularly intelligent killer who uses \"smart\" appliances and tools as weapons. Amelia and Rhyme have a great deal of difficulty trying to determine what the killer's motive actually is, and they don't know how to tie together a series of what seems to be a lot of totally unrelated crimes. The suspense is maintained throughout the book, and the forensic information is comprehensive. As usual, I enjoyed the relationship issues between Rhyme and Sachs. This apparently mis-matched couple make a formidable team when they work together."}, {"userName": "Bruce Hatton", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51061124-bruce-hatton", "userReview": "The master of the labyrinthine plots and multi-twist endings returns with the 12th book featuring quadriplegic criminalist Lincoln Rhyme and his partner Amelia Sachs.As with previous novels \"The Blue Nowhere\" and \"The Burning Wire\" the main plot here focuses on the dangers of modern technology when manipulated by those with malign purposes. The start of the novel finds Rhyme no longer working with the NYPD, owing to what her perceives as a mistake he made in a previous investigation. He's assisting in a civil case for the widow of a man killed by a faulty escalator while Sachs is on the hunt for a serial killer. Before long, however, the two cases converge.There are also two sub-plots: one involving a previous boyfriend of Sachs, Nick Carelli - a character I took an instant dislike to. Thankfully he gets his comeuppance in the end. The other involves \"Rookie\" Ron Pulaski's further investigations into the case that caused Rhyme to stop working with the NYPD. As in previous novels, it's usually the incidents involving Ron that provide the most humour.Perhaps, as Lincoln Rhyme novels go, this is not quite up there with the best, such as \"The Coffin Dancer\" or \"The Empty Chair\", but it's still a thoroughly engrossing read."}, {"userName": "Valerie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2258444-valerie", "userReview": "The latest novel featuring Amelia Sachs and Lincoln Rhyme starts out with Amelia in pursuit of a particularly vicious murderer called Unsub 40. He apparently used a ball peen hammer to kill a man. Rhyme is of no help on this case at first because he has decided to focus on civil law, and has been lecturing, and in this particular case, trying to determine who is at fault for a man who fell through an escalator and was killed in an especially gruesome manner. However, in the course of each of their investigations, Sachs and Rhyme find that their particular cases are connected, so Rhyme once again has his team assemble at his home to try and figure out the who and the why. The man known as Unsub 40 is a bit unusual looking, as he is over six feet tall and weighs somewhere between 140 and 150 pounds. When they start focusing on the particulars of the case, and the additional crimes being perpetrated, they realize that Unsub 40 may be a person who has a problem with blatant consumerism and society's technological gadgets. However, all is not as it seems in this story, and there are additional factors which tie the whole story together so that it eventually all makes sense. Nothing is as it appears at first glance."}, {"userName": "Tom Tischler", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5357814-tom-tischler", "userReview": "This is book twelve in the Jeffery Deaver Lincoln Rhymes series.

As usual, Deaver comes up with many ways to kill folks, some pretty basic and some more advanced but requiring far more work than I can imagine it being worth. While the book features interesting plots and the usually interesting characters I found some instances of \"Deus ex mechina\" that really stretched credibility since their were no prior tip-offs, at least to me.
