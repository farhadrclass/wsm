It's not a novel for the light thriller reader, but is filled with political insights about the Ukraine and its world relationships in general and GMO activities in particular. As such, it incorporates these realities into a story line packed with action and presenting the desperate efforts of a bad spy to free his woman from government kidnappers.Action is swift and tension and characterization is well done; but it's the sequence of events that holds attention as Seth moves through this foreign land with relatively few tools, ill-prepared for the role of either rescuer or spy. Despite (or perhaps because of) his lack of professional background in either, he succeeds where more seasoned operatives have failed - and edges ever closer to a bigger truth in the process of uncovering who has captured Natasha, and why.GMO foods, international politics, and quests for power: steeped in the flavor of modern times, To Russia for Love is international thriller reading at its best."}, {"userName": "Robert S.

The last third of the book is the author's discussion about GMO. This novel should not be read until one has read \"An Involuntary Spy\" because without knowing the characters and information in the first book, one would become confused about the characters."}], "description": "Be held hostage to the fast action and intrigue in the best selling controversial thriller of modern day espionage.\nUkraine is perched at the beginning of a bloody civil war.
