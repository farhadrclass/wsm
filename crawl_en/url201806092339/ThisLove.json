This Love picks you up and envelopes you into this story, which, thanks to interesting, likeable characters, means you really care about what happens \u2013 particularly to protagonist Sophie and her knight in shining armour, Ben. (Ben\u2026 there are no words for Ben; he is bound to be the new favourite love interest for many people which would not surprise me).The first half of the story starts with high drama but then calms down a bit and moves much more slowly, before the second half ramps up the tension (and emotion) again, leaving me a bit of a blubbling wreck at the end! That being said, it\u2019s got light-hearted parts too, and is a story I really enjoyed reading, from first page to last. There are surprises and some parts I didn\u2019t see coming.This Love will stay with you long after you finish reading it!* Many thanks to Simon & Schuster for providing a copy of this novel on which I chose to write an honest and unbiased review *"}, {"userName": "Rachel Gilbey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5801320-rachel-gilbey", "userReview": "Emotionally drained is one way of describing how I feel after reading this simply spectacular book, I have found completely unputdownable from start to finish. It is a book that begins with high drama and really hooks you into the action and introduces you at the same time to the main characters, Sophie who usually leads a rather reclusive life, for very understandable reasons that you find out as the book progresses to Ben who is instantly cast in the hero role, but whether he is too good to be true is to be seen. There is a great deal of depth to both Sophie and Ben and very little in this book goes particularly smoothly, there always seems to be back story to be revealed, which it is on a need to know basis. In This Love there is so much going on but realistically if I mention any specifics I feel like I would be spoiling your enjoyment of the tension, or the turns that the book takes. The writing grabs you instantly and just doesn't let you go, even after the book has ended. There were moments that I sat there gasping open mouthed as I didn't expect the story to go in that direction, there were some more light hearted moments too, but on the whole this is a book that you will almost certainly need a box of tissues by your side, if you are even slightly more emotional than I am! This Love is a story unsurprisingly about love, please note I mean love and not necessarily romance. It deals with the love of a family, love of friendship, as well as falling in love against perhaps your better judgment. It surrounds these themes as well as a lot more into a compelling story It isn't just about Ben and Sophie, their friends play a huge part in the book too, often providing some light relief. Watch out for Carla the hairdresser, an incident involving a rolling pin, and Sophie's best friend's husband Gary putting his foot in his mouth big time. In a story that is as dramatic as it is emotional, as tender and touching as it is amusing, there is one thing I can say for certain. This Love is a fabulous story, written by an incredibly talented author, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone! My only suggestion would be to make sure you set aside a day to read this, ideally somewhere you won't be interrupted as I can promise you will resent anyone besides Sophie and Ben trying to get your attention!"}, {"userName": "Irena", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17737927-irena", "userReview": "Actual rating: 3,5"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8012552-karen", "userReview": "Another lovely read from Dani Atkins, her style of writing just draws you in, totally enjoyable"}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5774280-kelly", "userReview": "So, I've just finished this book and I cried. Proper tears. What a rollercoaster of emotions, I loved Ben right from the moment he caught Sophie in his arms, he caught so much more than that - he caught her heart. I kinda guessed about her brothers accident - as soon as I made the connection (I thought it was because of his limp, I thought the accident had caused it, but I was wrong. It was worse, so much worse...) but that made me want it not to be true...If you do read this book, don't read the last few chapters while on public transport. I warn you - it won't be pretty, you *will* be an emotional mess! Be prepared at home with a box of tissues!

She writes about heartbreaking situations with a sensitivity which goes deeper than typical Hollywood saccharine schmaltz. I start reading each of Dani's books with almost a sense of trepidation; I just know she's going to make me cry, and I'm going to enjoy doing so.The story starts with a dramatic event, introducing the main character, Sophie, right in the midst of the flames. The way Dani describes Sophie's fear is very real, and I found myself holding my breath several times. I was drawn right into Sophie's story, feeling every bit of her grief and reluctance to let anyone get close to her.Dani's characters are great. Ben, Sophie's random rescuer, is an angel (figuratively - not literally!). He is the perfect leading man; gentle, kind, and perfect for helping Sophie find salvation. The supporting cast is, as usual, excellent. We meet some beautifully written characters, who make us laugh and smile in equal measure, with their own back stories.There is so much more to this story, but I don't want to spoil it for other readers. Just be prepared to be wrong-footed at every turn and to have your emotions toyed with by this fabulously tormenting author in her latest moving novel.Never stop making me cry, Dani - you know I love it!"}, {"userName": "Emma Gallis", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40584890-emma-gallis", "userReview": "Yet again what an incredible story! Just as you think another one of Dani's books can't live up to the other ones (which you should definitely get reading if you haven't) she blows you away again! What a beautiful story and the way she writes is brilliant! What I'd describe as an in depth chic lit.. could not put it down! You really do bond with the characters!

Het is dramatisch en misschien een beetje voorspelbaar, dat wel, maar het was met momenten hartverwarmend en tegelijk breekt het dat hart dat net zo warm werd door dit verhaal in twintigduizend stukjes. Af en toe had ik een beetje problemen met het hoofdpersonage (get a grip, meid!), maar al bij al vond ik het een aangenaam boek om te lezen. Het is zeker geen hoogstaande literatuur, maar het is ook niet een chicklit zoals je er dertien in een dozijn vindt.

All the emotions and situations created around the characters are intense and pure heartbreak. There is hope and hopelessness in the same breath. It is just like in life, you are dealt with not so good a hand and then someone comes along the way and makes things a bit bearable, better to some extent. I have read a few too many books on this topic and at the moment they are too heartbreaking.

Atkins has created these characters and plot that draw you in and encompass you with such a sincere development.

The plot pace and intrigue was fantastic - never felt too slow or boring at any point.

This is one of these, and Dani Atkins' books never fail to be unputdownable.But... and here's the warning - it's VERY sad. If you are allergic to books with tearful endings, this won't be for you. I also found the character of Sophie to be slightly shallow and annoying, but I can see exactly why and how she has become like this, and she does reach a much more mature personality by the end. The book is too good to deduct anything more than a quarter of a star for what may simply be a personal opinion.So... would I read it again?

They are written beautifully, fast paced, easy to read and will have you grabbing for a tissue. You will just fall in love with the characters, especially Ben who is the real hero. I really enjoyed reading this book and I was immersed into Sophie's and Ben's world. I would highly recommend this book to you all but a tissue or two will be needed! Dani is definitely an author to watch out for! A well deserved five stars from me as I loved the cover and a book that makes me cry now and again... A must buy from me!

She lives in isolation, having shut herself off from the world when a tragedy struck her family when she was fifteen. One night there is a fire and suddenly Sophie must escape from her protective cocoon. She escapes into the arms of her rescuer, Ben, Sophie does not know it yet, but escaping her burning flat will mean changing her life forever. 'This Love' has now become my new favourite of Atkins', I really think she gets better with every novel! I adored everything about this, from the wonderfully emotional yet happy plot, to the gorgeous characters that Atkins has created in the form of Ben and Sophie. I could not be prised away from this novel until I had got to the ending. The plot is obvious and I really was not surprised by anything that happened but do you know what? I do not care!! The lack of surprise did not bother me in the slightest. For me the sign of a wonderful novel is that you can be utterly absorbed in it without constantly needing dramatic twists.For a novel such as 'This Love' to work the characters need to be strong, as I have mentioned I loved the characters of Sophie and Ben. To follow them as they tentatively become friends and then maybe more was an incredibly special journey. Their story is full of love and laughter but paralleled with real heartbreak. They start knowing each other full of secrets and are two damaged people but together they find their way back to living.'This Love' is a very romantic, endearing, emotionally traumatic read and I loved every word of it. My real sadness now is that I have left the world of Sophie and Ben.

Having read and absolutely loved all of her books (Our Song being my favourite 2016 read) I can honestly say she is my favourite storyteller. Despite the tragedies and sadness we find in her books, her writing, characters and plots are just something very beautiful.This Love is no exception. Essentially it's a story about the different kinds of love and how we deal with it; friendships, families, and that at the start of a new relationship. Like all Dani's novels this starts off with drama, in the form of a flat fire. Here we meet Sophie, she struggles to let people get close to her after a tragedy in her teens. Also Ben, the random passer by who comes to Sophie's rescue. He's not long ago sold his own company over, after being a workaholic. He's now taking time out to decide what to do next.I was once again instantly hooked to this story. I love how Dani makes you feel like you intimately know the characters, they always feel real and I can visualize what they're doing so clearly. I also love the twists and turns you find in her stories, the big ones I seem to spot, but she always surprises me with little ones that actually play a big part to the background of the story. This is another gorgeously written book. There are moments that will make you laugh and smile (definitely those that involve Sophie and a rolling pin!) but it will really tug at your heart strings; I cried at Our Song, but this completely broke me! Whenever I finish a Dani Atkins book, I just sit there for ages thinking about the story and coming to terms with what she's put me through - that's why she is undoubtedly my favourite author."}, {"userName": "teleri llinos", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41775391-teleri-llinos", "userReview": "\"I dreamt about the fire again last night.

Review done. kthnxIf only this review would be as easy to right as that ^^^. Unfortunately due to the fact that Dani Atkins\u2019 novel made my inner Ice Queen surrender to every single emotion in the storyline, I am feeling a smidge tongue-tied and may also end up in tears (again) by the time I have reached the end of this review.(Yes folks, again)Before I started reading, I had seen on social media that Atkins\u2019 novel was receiving tweets stating that it was \u2018extremely emotional\u2019. Honestly? No disrespect to the author, I rolled my eyes and went \u2018PFFT\u2019 when I read that. Why? Because it can sometimes take a lot for me to truly get emotional about something, y\u2019know, actually feel emotions -shudders-. Seeing as I was going to read \u2018This Love\u2019 anyway, the emotional responses made me rather intrigued. I knew deep down that I would probably end up being one of the few people to not cry at this book, because I am an Ice Queen\u2026.After reading the book:Me, not cry? Seriously? What on EARTH possessed me to be all cocky about not getting emotional?! I bawled like a baby, except it being the ugly version. If you don\u2019t believe me nose on my Instagram as I felt the absolute need to tweet the author with my ugly crying face, seconds after reading her book. I\u2019m nice like that.(Dani, I\u2019ll pay for your therapy).\u2018This Love\u2019 melted me like the snowman from the movie, The Snowman. It wasn\u2019t the general type of emotional either (if there is one, but you know what I mean). It was the sort of emotion that comes from deep within your soul, absolutely cripples your senses and logical thinking, whilst also making you feel as though your own heart is breaking for the characters within the storyline. Raw.Once again I am having to be slightly careful with my words to ensure that I don\u2019t accidentally give any of the plot away. It\u2019s pretty clear that Atkins\u2019 has written \u2018This Love\u2019 from her own heart as her attention to detail where the storyline is concerned, is outstanding. Atkins\u2019 hasn\u2019t just written the bare necessities of a storyline and let the characters do the talking, no. She has created a life within the pages of the book. A life where we are able to visualise each character, every heart breaking moment, every momentous occasion, and yes, even being able to visualise the materialistic aspects too. Take a door for example. To us it would be just a door, it opens and closes, simple. If Dani Atkins\u2019 were to describe a door in this storyline, it would be the most beautiful, iconic, majestic door you have ever seen. It may do the same things as our door, but which one would you remember out of the two?I have read a lot of books where the characters love stories attempt to rival that of Romeo and Juliet\u2019s or Kim Kardashian and Kanye West (I jest on the latter\u2026I think), and whilst those love stories are always \u2018awwww you guys!!!\u2019, I struggle to relate because I am not a romantic. However, the love-type-story contained in THIS novel really made me believe that there is a little thing called love, out there. It was believable and realistic; what more could you ask for?As for the characters in Atkins\u2019 book, I would LOVE to sit here and have the opportunity to write my full opinion on them, however, I think my wrists would be slapped as spoiler central. So, I will try to be as vague as I can by saying that I LOVED reading about Sophie\u2019s journey, as well as Ben\u2019s journey. Their individual personalities were wonderfully written and a sheer joy to read.\u2018THIS LOVE\u2019 HAS TAKEN ITS TOLL ON MEEEEEEEEEEE, I SAID GOODBYE, TOO MANY TIMES BEFOREEEEEEE,Please say I wasn\u2019t the only one to do that\u2026.? Maroon 5-age!Anyway, I veered off. Apologies.\u2018This Love\u2019 is such a beautifully written, literary work of art. Atkins\u2019 outstanding portrayal of love, life and new starts, truly opened my eyes to things I never would have paid attention to before now. I would be lying if I said that this book didn\u2019t completely blow my mind; because it did.Absolutely phenomenal \u2013 if I could give it more than 5*\u2019s, I would in a heartbeat.Thank you S&S!"}, {"userName": "Michelle Kirby", "userReviewDate": "Jul 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19110287-michelle-kirby", "userReview": "This was a compelling easy read full of deceptively challenging subject matter. The opening sections I found particularly harrowing simply because of recent history and the Grenfell Tower fire- the heroine is caught in a fire in her third storey flat and can't escape. The story starts as the fire gets perilously close to her (we smell it, we see it, we hear it, these sections are beautifully written) and then she is rescued by a handsome stranger Ben. Once rescued, we follow her going to the hospital, searching for her flat, finding somewhere to live- all of these things with the constant and convenient assistance of Ben. It's as if he's her guardian Angel or something. It's lovely but suspicious.Anyway, the story goes on- we find out about Sophie's neuroses, her job, her limited social life, her introverted nature. Then there is Ben's strange penchant for openness and helping, his uncanny empathy, his story of success and early retirement to assist the dying in his beautiful and bespoke architectural house with its unique and captivating garden of tropical plants. Ben is a constant presence, and we meet his friends- Carla the psychedelic hairdresser, Tom the limping gardener, Alice the cat loving pensioner with spunk. On Sophie's side we have the stable best friend and husband and two kids, and her parents, and we learn and sense damage from years before and the loss of a brother. Sophie is damaged goods, and Ben seems to be this constantly present and beautiful hero who is there to pick up the pieces. Reading this, it felt contrived. And as the plot twisted and turned, we find out just why he is always there, and watch the two fall in love. But as with all these things, this is not just about her repairing herself- he has secrets and a past that we begin to learn about, and as the story climaxes it becomes something it wasn't promising to be, but is all the better for that. It's a very moving and lovely story, and makes for a gripping and emotional read. The only reason it doesn't get the full five stars from me is that I found it predictable. Maybe because I have read a lot recently, but this had a 'Jo Jo Moyes feel' throughout and in my view some of the plot twists were almost too well flagged so that when we find out what we need to find out, it's actually not that much of a surprise- although we are willing it not to happen. The exception to this is the final twist which I hadn't seen coming - for those who have read it, and to avoid spoilers to those who haven't I will call this the wardrobe twist. While this was a surprise I found the whole thing a bit too neat, tying up all the loose ends and linking Sophie and Ben in a way that I thought was just too linear and too contrived. I'm not sure I believed this last bit- nor that it was entirely necessary, but that is just my personal opinion. Nevertheless a great book, and much more than a simple summer read. Don't let the sappy title and the chick lit billing deceive you- there's a lot more to it than that."}, {"userName": "Ingstje", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16236266-ingstje", "userReview": "Real heroes do exist! This is just the most perfect romance novel, filled with emotion!This book opened with a bang. I personally love the damsel in distress theme (it\u2019s so me) and this is exactly what you\u2019re going to get here. It feels like this novel was written especially for me! This Love starts with some very tense chapters with Sophie being trapped in her appartment while there\u2019s a fire raging in the building on the floor below hers. The situation felt authentically tense and dangerous and I\u2019m pretty confident this author could have a go at the thriller genre and write a bestseller. I was very happy her witty remarks also relieved some of the tension because I\u2019m not sure my heart would have survived otherwise; I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry while she was trying to escape. That\u2019s the first time I could feel I was in for an emotional read.When Sophie gets out safe to the ground she\u2019s rushed off to the hospital; she didn\u2019t even get a chance to thank Ben properly for his involvement in her escape. She assumes she\u2019ll never see him again but of course something brings them back together again and again and the blossoming of their love was so beautiful to witness, it filled my heart. Ben is perfect, he\u2019s humorous, he\u2019s caring\u2026 He goes out looking for Fred, her cat, without her knowing, for hours, so who\u2019s not going to love a man like that? Sophie isn\u2019t looking for love though\u2026They become best of friends and are growing closer together day by day, but then suddenly when he has his friends over, he can\u2019t get her out of the room fast enough. Did she read him wrongly and will she admit to herself what she\u2019s feeling? Can she get over her feelings of fear for the future because what if he would leave her too, like that other person she loved and was so brutally taken away from her?My heart shuddered quite a few times while reading this novel, it ballooned, almost spilled and was punctured more than once too. It was a joy to get to know Ben, Sophie and all of Ben\u2019s wonderful friends. Even if you think you know where this novel is hurtling to and you think you\u2019ve got it all under control, piece of cake, well you\u2019re wrong, so wrong. If you\u2019re really emphatic you\u2019re going to feel it SO hard.If you want a tear-jerker, look no further because this book will have you laughing and crying and ultimately leave you with a major book-hangover!This Love is perfect for fans of Jojo Moyes and Colleen Hoover. I\u2019ve found myself a new favourite author!"}, {"userName": "Fabulous Book Fiend", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7373175-fabulous-book-fiend", "userReview": "I picked this book up knowing that there was a lot of hype surrounding it but not really knowing an awful lot more about it and I think that was a really good move. Dani Atkins really knows how to write a story that comes of the back of a tragic event but she has really celled herself with this novel. I spent the first third of this novel a little bit terrified as to what was going o happen to either of the main character, the next third loving life and really loving a blossoming relationship and then the last third being terrified that something awful was going to happen and trying to work out what. What a literary roller coaster-so much fun!This book starts with a fire and Sophie, our main character, being trapped inside her apartment. As I mentioned above, this is incredibly tense and not something to read if that is a trigger to you bit I was so compelled by the first part of this book that the first 150 pages just flew by. I felt like I got to know Sophie fair quickly because of this major event and I think that this was an excellent way to open the move. We know from the blurb that something else tragic has happened to Sophie and this has effected her. From the beginning of the novel, I felt I could empathise with her as a main character and really rooted for her to get her life together again following the tragic events. Ben comes into Sophie's life right at the beginning and seems to be one of life's rarities, a genuinely nice guy, but we can see right from the word go that there is a little more to him than meets the eye but we're not sure what. The fun of working out what the mystery was with Ben, coupled with the fact that he helps Sophie to put her life back together again made for the middle of the book to be truly enchanting and just as compelling as the beginning of the book. I loved Ben as a character and really hope that some of his wonderful optimism rubbed off on me from reading this. The end of the book is really difficult to talk about without giving away any spoilers. Needless to say it is just as compelling as the previous sections of the novel and will definitely have you on the edge of your set. I reached the final few pages in a public place and had the common sense to leave them until I was back in the privacy of a hotel bedroom because you will definitely need tissues for this one and, should you wish to avoid crying in public, I would advice reading the final few chapters on your own or with an affectionate pet to keep you company. I loved this book so much more that I thought I would. I've read Dani's previous novels and this is definitely her best yet. If you are looking for a new book to pick up this week, something to take you away from the really world for just under 500 pages then this is definitely something you should be adding to you list right now. You will gasp, you will cry and you will come away from this read valuing life just a little bit more!"}, {"userName": "Mina Singh", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16596250-mina-singh", "userReview": "Words cannot describe how beautifully written this book is, but I will give it a try with some words: heart-breaking, heart-wrenching, warm, thoughtful, poignant, expressive and sad.Sophie is all grown up, but a part of her has been left behind in her youth. A tragedy that struck in her teens defines how she feels today and acts towards others. Her fear of death and safety for those she loves, keeps her cocooned within herself and not let others in. However, another almost tragic accident in current time forces her to literally jump to her safety and open herself to trusting another. Enter, the hero of our book, Ben. Ben saves Sophie from a burning building and they soon forge a bond that becomes unbreakable. Despite some initial inhibitions, circumstances push Sophie more and more towards Ben. Ben's amicable personality and need to help others, helps Sophie come out of her shell and they become close friends. Their friendship blossoms and continues to grow into more. Sophie is introduced to Ben's motley crew of friends and as she learns more about them and their lives, she hesitantly, but surely comes to accept life more than she in the past. However, Ben has a slightly mysterious vibe to him, which Sophie's best friend keeps reminding her not to rush into a relationship with him. As the novel progresses, you learn more about Sophie and Ben's past and began to put together the various pieces, which Dani alludes to throughout the book. There are some twist and turns until you get to the end of the book, which is very tense, touching, emotional and as another reader and reviewer put it very succinctly \"hope and hopelessness in the same breath.\" A must read, but heads up definitely have a box of tissue ready. Side note: This is my fourth Dani Atkins and since reading her debut the author continues to amaze with her books. Her books are definitely on the sad side and this one was no exception, but there is something about her writing, story-line, characters and flow of words that captivates you and keeps you intrigued right until the end."}, {"userName": "Karen Whittard", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30631037-karen-whittard", "userReview": "In This love we meet Sophie winter. A 31 year old who lives as works in her 1 bedroom flat. Who due to tragic events that have happened in her childhood is risk adverse and refuses to let anyone get close to her. That's is until the day that the block of flats that Sophie lives in catches fire. She tries her hardest to grab the attention of the crowd that has formed outside the burning building. But to no avail. Sophie is trapped with no way out. That is until she manages to grab the attention on a Ben a passing stranger in his car. Ben reacts quickly and becomes Sophie's knight in shining amour as he rescuers her from the burning building. Like all good love stories. Both Ben and Sophie come with their fair amount of baggage. Both refusing to let the other one in. Leading to some rather surprising circumstances in the book. This love is truly beautiful. It is a true love story and by that I mean it is not about romance. It is about the love that you feel deep down in your soul. The love that takes over and consumes everything. It is about the love between partners, and family but also friends. If you are anything like me this book will have you reaching for the tissue box on more than one occasion. But don't worry because their are also some wonderful light relief moments too. Mainly in the shape of Carla the hairdresser. This love will take you on a journey and will surprise you along the way. It really is a beautiful book that I cannot recommend enough. If you are a sucker for a good live story. Then look no further. Simply beautiful."}, {"userName": "Norazah", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/61309144-norazah", "userReview": "This is my first Dani Atkins book. I chose to read it based on its ratings and because I needed to move away to from my favourite genre crime-thriller-investigation to something lighter after finishing two books back to back. How wrong could I have been? This book completely broke me. This has nothing to do with the author's writing style because I completely fell in love with it from the first few pages. It has nothing to do with the characters because I found them all well developed, beautiful, and unique in their own way. The problem was with the story, probably because it was so well depicted, it took me back to my own past, the experience I had to go through which was all too similar to Sophie's and Ben's relationship towards the end, and the emotions that came along with the experience. I honestly would not have read this book if I had known. I was a sobbing mess when I finished it (I almost didn't want to finish it but because the need to know and to test myself was too strong, I continued). Without revealing too much, I would caution those who have experienced the painful heartache of losing a loved one that despite the years that have passed by is still clearly embedded in your memory, this may not be the best read for you. On the flipside, this is a beautifully written book and I love how it reads so smoothly, so for that, I am giving it 4.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Simona", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23519770-simona", "userReview": "*Book provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review*This Love is the second book by Dani Atkins I have read and it's safe to say that I fell in live with her writing once again, I even liked this one better than Our Song.It starts with a fire, where Sophie Winter is stuck, the only possibility is to jump out of the window, but she is very high up. She managed to get her cat Fred out and when a handsome stranger comes to her rescue, she is safe as well. However, she loses everything. She is determined to find her own way, at the hospital she can't reach her best friend though and when stranger Ben Stevens comes to her help again, she is unsure whether to take it or not. And then there is her cat, where was Fred?! She agrees to go with Ben, at least until the morning and he helps her in several ways. Even after Sophie leaving to stay with her best friend Julia, he seems to appear everywhere. Things get complicated at Julia's place, because of several circumstances and Sophie finally accepts Ben's offer to stay in his basement flat.That's when hey get to spend a lot more time together and they get to know each other. At first they don't share everything with each other, but after time both of them open up, about most things. I have to that I liked Ben from the start. He exuded warmth, passion and gentleness and the way he treated her was just so sweet. Of course they also get very close to each other and one thing leads to the other. Yes, it took quite a while for their feelings to develop, but the chemistry was there from the start and it was a very intense journey and continued to be so, when Sophie was tested about things that happened in the past and one of Ben's secret came out. This story is a roller-coaster ride of emotions, feelings play a very important role in this book and Dani Atkins captured them beautifully.Dani Atkins created some wonderful characters here, full of heart and love. They are very well drawn out and seem very authentic. Both Sophie and Ben learned a lot throughout this book and for Sophie it was extra hard to go through a different range of emotions. Through the writing I always felt really close to the story and what happened, it's captivating, spellbinding, heart breaking and poignant, I advise having a box of tissues close by, you are going to need them.This is for sure one of the best books I have read this year. Dani Atkins clearly is a very talented lady, can't wait for more."}], "description": "Sophie Winter\u00a0lives in a self-imposed\u00a0cocoon -\u00a0she's a single, thirty-one year old translator who works from home in her one bedroom flat.
