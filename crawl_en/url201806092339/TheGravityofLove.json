It has a vintage, classy distinctive feel which mirrors the book perfectly.The book focuses on Lewis and Joy, two souls who are lost in their own life\u2019s. Lewis\u2019s life is turned upside down by the arrival of a postcard in his mailbox. With Joy, we go on a journey with her to discover her own worth and is all that it seems in her life?The book flip-flops back and forth giving us the present day dilemma and then the solution in the flashback chapters. I was confused at the start of the book as to who was who and it was my own fault for trying to play reader detective and work out the story. It hindered my start of the journey with the book but that isn\u2019t a reflection of the book it was my need to know. Once I relaxed into Noelle\u2019s writing style I really enjoyed my journey and submerged fully into the atmospheric scenes that soak you in and linger long after you turn to the next page.There is a thread of music throughout the book. With nods to song lyrics which I thought was really beautiful and at one point when they played a tape in the car, I went and put it on as I read and it was a pretty awesome experience.The Gravity of Love is jam-packed with life lessons for us all. Secrets and lies are really what is at its very core. The horrendous and painful consequences that they can have at the time and years later.I highly recommend Noelle Harrisons, The Gravity of Love. It is an emotional journey start to finish and one you won\u2019t want to miss."}, {"userName": "Kaisha (The Writing Garnet)", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40776578-kaisha-the-writing-garnet", "userReview": "All reviews can be found on my blog at https://thewritinggarnet.wordpress.comIn the past I have been compared to an ice queen, whilst dubbing myself as the \u2018most unromantic person on the planet\u2019. After reading \u2018The Gravity of Love\u2019 however, I am not too sure whether I am 100% committed to my long standing nickname, and I\u2019ll tell you why.Set over two different timelines, featuring two different main characters, \u2018The Gravity of Love\u2019 had something special about it from the get go.Joy Sheldon is struggling to live up to her name and isn\u2019t quite finding the \u2018joy\u2019 in her life, especially after the passing of a well loved family member. For years, Joy has always seen herself as an outcast and, thanks to the passing of the family member, Joy\u2019s life got turned upside down by just three words. According to Joy\u2019s mother and husband, those three words mean diddly squat, but to Joy, those three words have unknowingly become the key to the truth about her life. Does Joy listen to her heart and search for the truth? Or should she just take the easy way out because her mother and husband disapprove?The other main character is a gentleman called Lewis Bell. Most of his \u2018getting to know him\u2019 chapters are set in the swinging sixties where he is struggling to choose between becoming a famous graphic designer, and actually doing the right thing by someone close to him. From an outsiders point of view, it\u2019s far too easy for us readers to make that decision when, as it later becomes clear, there is more to Lewis\u2019 life that meets the eye, and it\u2019s threatening to break his heart in two, all over again.We are nearing the end of May and, with 163 books read so far this year, I am spoilt for choice in regards to my favourite book of the year so far. Well, I thought I was. This story captivated me almost straight away with its simplistic tales of love, and its complex tales of family heartache mixed in with the uncertainty of grabbing life, and the \u2018what ifs\u2019 that go along with it. Never have I ever, until now, finished a book and sat hugging it to my chest because I didn\u2019t want the spell to break as soon as I put the book down. But, due to Noelle Harrison\u2019s enchanting and mesmerising story telling, I just could not help myself, feeling devastated that Joy and Lewis\u2019 story had come to an end.The way the two characters stories collided multiple times throughout the book, was simply outstanding and took my breath away. I always thought fate to be a load of tosh, but Lewis and Joy made me believe that fate was real, that true love is worth waiting for, and that the best things in life appear when you least expect it. Simplistic yet life changing \u2013 \u2018The Gravity of Love\u2019 is just that.Reading \u2018The Gravity of Love\u2019 made me feel as though my body was being re-engerised, creating an image which was not only surreal, it was the most beautiful thing my mind has ever captured. Noelle Harrison told a story to my soul and my heart, a story which blew me away to the most special place I could ever imagine going.\u2018The Gravity of Love\u2019 is, hand on heart, my most favourite book of 2018, and probably my most favourite book of all time. I wish I could bottle the feelings I revealed whilst reading this book, yet I don\u2019t think anyone could ever afford the price of them. This book is such an incredible, life affirming and heart-wrenching novel which made me feel, after 28 years of life on this planet, that I finally deserve to be here. I urge you all to get a copy of Noelle Harrison\u2019s thought-provoking and ornamental read \u2013 you will NOT be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Clair", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6583076-clair", "userReview": "The Gravity of Love is a beautiful read about just that, all consuming love in different forms and that 'in love, there's no such thing as coincidence' and this book conveys that wonderfully.The story is told through the voices of the two main characters, Joy and Lewis, across different timelines. The present time is 1989 and we meet Joy and Lewis, both living in a small Arizonian town who instantly strike up a friendship when they meet whilst watching the amazing sight of the Northern Lights.Joy is married to Eddie, who she married very young following an unexpected pregnancy however they were two people very much in love and went on to have another child. Roll forward when both her children are adults, Eddie is always working and Joy is a housewife and feeling unfulfilled in life. Everything that she does seems to be to please others. When Joy's beloved father dies she is rocked by his deathbed confession that she was adopted, Joy begins to question who she really is and who is the mysterious woman who abandoned her miles away in Ireland?Back in the late 1960's, Lewis was carving a successful career as a graphic designer, on the cusp of becoming partner in the firm with a massive deal. He is also in the middle of a passionate affair with Marnie....it is clear from the outset that all did not end well considering he is now living in Arizona with Samantha. When postcards start to arrive from Ireland, Lewis is convinced that Marnie is reaching out to him all these years later.What I absolutely adored with this book was hearing from both Joy and Lewis as well as the various timelines that beautifully weave together to the overall story. Alongside this, Noelle Harrison also conveys brilliantly the various settings of the book - we have the stifling dry heat of Arizona as well as the wet, cold (by comparison) and dull weather of Ireland. Mixed in we also have London in the 1960's - a brilliant combination of times and countries which add to the overall effect of this story.The Gravity of Love is a stunning exploration into just that, the gravity of love that spans time and countries as well as different kinds of love. Before I knew it, I was half way through and I was sad when I came to the end. Beautiful from start to finish!"}, {"userName": "Helena Stone", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31530338-helena-stone", "userReview": "It has been years since I last read a new No\u00eblle Harrison novel, but this book proves it was well worth the wait. The Gravity of Love is a stunning, intriguing and exquisitely plotted story that held me spell-bound from start to finish. It\u2019s a story about the ties that bind us, despite life and fate doing its best to keep or tear us apart. It\u2019s a tale about coming to grips with the past in order to open the future up to new possibilities. And it tells of finding courage in times of despair so that it may lead you to the life that was always meant to be yoursI don\u2019t want to say a whole lot about the plot beyond what you can read in the blurb. This story unfolds slowly, moving back and forth between 1967 and 1989, revealing a little more about the past and with it, clarifying the \u2018present\u2019, with each subsequent segment. I have to say that the revelations in the end didn\u2019t come as a huge shock to me, but I\u2019m not sure they were meant to be. After all, this is a contemporary novel, not a mystery.I do have to admit that I had one or two issues with Lewis\u2019s behaviour in the past, until I would remind myself of the time that part of the story was set in, and the way society operated in those days. In fact, it was exactly because neither Lewis nor Joy (or anybody else in this story) is faultless, that this story worked for me so well. At no point did this plot sound far-fetched, while I absolutely adored the way coincidences gave meaning to both the storyline and the character\u2019s actions and reactions.While I wouldn\u2019t call this book a romance, the story comes with strong romantic themes and storylines, not to mention tasteful yet hot sexy scenes. The theme of this book is that some things are meant to be, that some connections exist even before the people involved are fully aware of each other\u2019s existence. This means story has strong leanings toward determinism. Every act in the past is not only linked to what happens in the present, but also crucial for events in the present to be able to occur. A leads to B, which pushes the characters towards C, but not always in the way they imagine.I want to end this review with a word about No\u00eblle Harrison\u2019s writing because she creates beautiful images with her words. Vivid descriptions pull the reader in, create a tangible atmosphere and place you in the moment so well that you can almost see that Aurora Borealis with your own eyes. You\u2019ll feel the rain and experience the wildness of the Irish west coast as you read these pages. The aroma of flowers and fruit will tease your senses and fully emerge you in this story. Just as you will leave the book feeling that you got to know Joy and Lewis so well that you would recognise them if you met them on the street. And such a meeting would not surprise you, because Lewis and Joy are so alive on the page it seems possible that they would jump off it and enter the \u2018real\u2019 world.Long story short: The Gravity of Love is a well plotted, beautifully told, and intriguing book that left me delighted and enriched by the time I finished it. I highly recommend this book, as well as everything else, by No\u00eblle Harrison."}, {"userName": "Joanne", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33121229-joanne", "userReview": "The Gravity of Love is just my kind of book, moving back and forth in time, weaving together the various characters' stories. Lewis was a young graphic designer having a passionate affair with Marnie in 1960s London. She was also a talented designer but he let her down badly and they parted acrimoniously. Years later, now married to Samantha and living in Arizona, mysterious postcards arrive from Ireland which he knows must be from her.\u00a0Joy also lives in Arizona. She married Eddie when she became pregnant at 17. Two children later she is a housewife who has never had the chance to follow her own dreams. She feels like her family doesn't know her especially when they tear up her beloved garden and replace it as a surprise. On his deathbed, her father revealed she was adopted but her mother won't talk about it.\u00a0 All she knows is that her birth mother was Irish. With another revelation in her homelife, she feels even more rootless.Joy and Lewis meet by chance on several occasions and sense a kindred spirit. Both seem to be searching and yearning for something. The front of the book says \"In love, there is no such thing as coincidence.\" There are many coincidences throughout the book and yet they all seem very plausible. Coincidences do happen in life and sometimes feel like they are just meant. The author has conveyed her settings wonderfully from the dry heat of the Arizona desert, to London in the swinging sixties, to the English home counties in the 1950s where Lewis and his sister Lizzie are passed from one relative to another which has a profound impact on their lives, and finally to a wet and stormy Ireland perhaps reflecting the inner turmoil of the characters. Is the rainbow a symbol of hope for Lewis and Joy?\u00a0I really enjoyed The Gravity of Love and found it a very compelling read. It shows how issues from the past must be resolved to move on in the present. The ending was unexpected but uplifting and perfect."}, {"userName": "Sandra Ireland", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33134275-sandra-ireland", "userReview": "This compelling new novel by Irish author Noelle Harrison explores relationships, and the raw, elemental power love has over us. In the grip of passion, humans can make unexpected moves and questionable choices. The inevitable repercussions, across time and space, are wonderfully laid bare in this engrossing page turner. The main characters, Joy and Lewis, are finally drawn, thrown together by a random set of circumstances. Both searching, both on different trajectories- I was thoroughly intrigued by how their stories would play out. The novel\u2019s sense of place too is beautifully wrought; from the heat of Arizona, the drizzle of Swinging Sixties London, and the lush green lanes of Ireland.
