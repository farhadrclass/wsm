Baaaaaad. Okay, this isn't the worst book I've ever read, but for a Laymon book, it's distinctly horrible, in extremely bad taste, and too dull in too many sections to give it that zap! and zing! I've come to expect from him. The late Richard Laymon is always my go-to guy for a pulpy, sometimes sleazy, never politically correct but always satisfying horror romp. There's just something so delightfully wicked and deranged about his straightforward, shoot from the hip, slice like a razor blade prose that puts you right into the action and hardly ever relents until the last page is turned. Once upon a time, Stephen King referred to his own work as the literary equivalent of a Big Mac and fries. Not a chance Mr. King; even on your worst day you offer up something rich and tasty with complex flavor profiles that linger long in the memory luring readers back over and over again for repeated tastings. Laymon's books, however (and I love them for this) are a cheeseburger and fries that you wolf down and perhaps groan in pleasure while doing so, then lie back for a satiated moment of stoned out bliss. You'd never want to subsist entirely on a diet of Laymon books, but Jesus, who doesn't get a craving every now and then for an injection of grease and carbs?But god help you if you get a bad burger and spend the night in the john or grasping that bottle of Pepto Bismol in your weak and shaky hands (I'm definitely taking this metaphor too far, but seriously, I feel like I just ate a bad burger, and I'm not happy about it). The indigestion is leaving me a little pissy and put out. This book has its moments that salvage it from the garbage heap completely -- the last section in the Funhouse is pretty messed up and unfolds nicely with Laymon's characteristic cinematic style. Why more of his books have not been made into movies is beyond me. They are the perfect fodder for the slasher crowd. But for the most part, this book is too slow to really get started. The characters are mostly terrible and so dislikable it kept making me curl my lip in distaste. I've pretty much gotten used to Laymon's standard sex-obsessed male adolescent who ogles all the female characters and thinks nasty, inappropriate things about them in his mind. Doesn't matter if death is breathing down your neck or some monster is crawling up out of the floor, if there's any chance of getting laid, these male characters will never pass up an opportunity to cop a feel or make out. This time the level of inappropriate hormone-driven angst is ridiculous, and insulting. The comments made about the girls drove me bananas! Maybe I'm just getting too old for this shit. All I know is my tolerance for blatant male chauvinism bordering on misogyny has whittled down to zero. Laymon tries to balance this with \"strong\" female leads who are the heroes of the story, but it wasn't enough to tip the scales for me. Furthermore, there are huge, long, meandering sections supposedly reserved for \"character development\" but do much more to bog the story down than enrich it in any way. Sorry Laymon my man. Rest in peace and all, but this one is a real miss for me."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1254714-steve", "userReview": "Wheeeee! Fun Land! More Laymon mayhem that gives ominous meaning to Under the Boardwalk. Not the best Laymon I've read, but perhaps more interesting than most, since there actually seems to be a few things going on beneath the surface. Peer pressure and teens, homeless people, revenge, all come into play, but with Laymon's spin that includes a giant spider, punk rockers, murderous freaks & geeks, a banjo playing heroine, and a FunHouse battle that reminded me of the end of Them. Some reviewers have dinged this one for being long and padded. It is long (500 pages), but with Laymon the pages tend to fly by. So I'm OK with that. I actually think Laymon spent the extra pages to establish the boardwalk/beach atmosphere. And on that front, I think the novel succeeds. The story line is fairly simple, with teen age vigilantes (\"trollers\") terrorizing crazy homeless people (\"trolls\") who are hanging around the amusement park at the board walk in Boleta Bay. But there's more to it than that since people have been disappearing around Boleta Bay -- for years. The leader of the teen age gang, Tanya, is one mean psycho who seems to be losing it, and quickly. But there's a reason for that, and by book's end she's a tragic figure trapped in revenge mode. One of the cool things about this book is that Laymon cuts against your expectations. Yes, some of the trolls are just mentally ill, but some are also really bad, as a crusading newspaper writer finds out. One thing missing, or not as prevalent as I've found in other Laymon novels, is the humor. There are funny moments, but not as many. There's more real sadness to this effort, despite the Fun Land glitter and lights."}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin", "userReview": "There's a bit of a story here. Browsing through Goodreads, I ran across the page on Richard Laymon and was surprised to see he passed away in 2001.I met him in a science fiction book store autograph party in the 90s. There were only a handful of people there so we had a good hour or two just talking amongst ourselves. Needless to say, Laymon was a very nice enthusiastic man who was in love with books and writing. He autographed a copy of Resurrection Dreams which I remembered reading and liking very much but I have not read any more Laymon since then. So recently I looked for the book in my collection to reread yet I couldn't find it! Instead I stumbled across Funland, a novel that I must have bought at the same time since it is autographed and inscribed, \"Marvin, Have fun at the boardwalk...but stay out from under it!\". I totally forgot about this book and am sure I never read it. So now's the time to read it!---------------------So I finished it and it is an amusing read firmly in the range of modern 80s horror novels set up by King and McCammon. The amusement park in the lazy California beach town of Boleta Bay (a take off of the non-fictitious Bodega Bay made famous by Hitchcock?)is plagued by trolls, the name the residents give the unsavory homeless element. Teenagers called trollers set themselves up as vigilantes until the harassment turns into murder. From there, Laymon bring in other sub-plots elements including a mysterious funhouse and proprietor to wrap up the last 100 pages of continuous action. It's a good summer read, mildly scary and entertaining despite somewhat one dimensional protagonists.Yet this 1990 novel made me quite uncomfortable. In the 80s, President Reagan virtually eliminated the funding for government institutions for the mentally ill. His intent was to remove the mentally ill from the institutions which he saw as huge financial drains and often ineffective at improving the person and directing them to halfway houses and boarding facilities that would work on integrating the mentally ill into society. Yet there was no real effort or funding to set up these types of facilities and the mentally ill were forgotten, many of them joining the ranks of the homeless. The homeless population soared. The problem continues today with the homeless population being viewed as addicts and \"crazies\", a different take on this population from the, as Layman described himself, \"bums and beggars\" of pre-90s America.(From here on, there may be spoilers)Layman appears to be mirroring this change in perception, this paranoia of the homeless. His trolls are definitely mentally ill and always malicious. The townpeople are only protecting their way of life and the trollers are portrayed as heroes until one of their vicious pranks go wrong. The liberal \"bleeding heart\" woman journalist is written as naive and is punished for it when her naivety ends up in her death. Layman appears torn in his views. It's bad to persecute the unfortunate yet they should stay hidden and away from normal people. In other word, he exhibits the same pull of conscience most people of the 90s did when the abandoned mentally ill showed up on their streets. Layman however doesn't really know where to take this and late in the novel he introduces a funhouse element of horror that exists more to get him out of his corner rather than to enhance the plot. Perhaps the most intriguing thing about this novel is that it illustrates how the social problems of the time creates our fears and horrors. This novel, for good or bad, feeds on this fear. Overall, it is just a horror novel, a pretty good one at that, but I wish the author took a stand on his theme and explored it a little better."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56438628-john", "userReview": "4.5 starsThis was a fun and suspenseful read with a crazy ending!"}, {"userName": "Vicki Willis", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32195771-vicki-willis", "userReview": "This one was hard for me to get into.

Although it's slower paced than most of the author's other novels, I never lost interest and tore through the book in a couple of sittings. The final showdown in the funhouse is classic, action-packed Laymon.I probably would have upped my rating on this one to a 5 if not for the laggier sections and an odd loose thread in the story that Laymon could have tied up with a single scene or even just a short paragraph. It wasn't anything major, and it didn't keep me from enjoying the story, but those kinds of loose threads nag at me (I'd say more but don't want to give away any of the plot). Still, it's a great read.If you're a horror fan just stumbling onto Laymon, I'd suggest starting with In the Dark or Island before moving on to Funland, but if you're already addicted to Mr. Laymon's work, don't miss this one."}, {"userName": "Evans Light", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7008067-evans-light", "userReview": "3.5 Stars.Well written, but a fantastic setting ultimately can't save a slow burner that withholds its pleasures for the very end.Clearly a \"Laymon-lite\" title targeted at a slightly more juvenile audience than some of his other work, Laymon does a good job at juggling multiple story lines and bringing it all seamlessly together at the end. Unfortunately, his character interactions are awkward and tough to read. I found myself scanning and flipping through much of the book. When the grand finale does come, it's a bit too over the top and utterly unconvincing to be much more than a trip through a fun house, which I suspect will be enough for most readers.Had I read this as a teenager it would probably be a five star read; as an adult I prefer Laymon's more extreme visions."}, {"userName": "Quentin Wallace", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33274222-quentin-wallace", "userReview": "This was the first Richard Laymon novel I'd read after hearing about him for years. I was a little disappointed to be honest, but I also plan to read a few more of his novels to get a better sampling of his work.Funland had an interesting premise, but the plot just seemed to meander. I think this book could have been edited down and been a better novel. The characters were interesting, but honestly didn't seem all that real to me. And the ending seemed to come out of nowhere. I don't like to put spoilers in my reviews, so I'll just say the ending didn't really fit in with what you'd expect. I understood what he was going for, but it just seemed out of place. Actually the entire storyline was disjointed.Overall, it was creepy and it was interesting, but overall it feel a little flat to me.

I was a fan of horror back in the '80s but I think it's pretty safe to say my preferences for fiction lay more on the lyrical/literary side of the scale than the splatterpunk/grindhouse side. (Of course, horror fiction being horror fiction, only at the farthest edges will you find something that doesn't have at least a touch of both but I hope you can grant me the efficacy of my hasty, hackneyed metaphor.)Laymon was always too far over on the grindhouse side for my tastes. The original publication of The Woods Are Dark seriously screwed up thirteen year old me (as a priapic teen, I couldn't help but go back for the copious sex and nudity, even as things grew progressively more and more awful). But even as a teen at my most helplessly lustful, I found elements of Laymon's worldview strangely hollow and unconvincing.In my experience, Laymon pretty much writes consistently from this worldview--that of a teenager with a boner--even when the POV is from one of his female characters. As in the slasher movies of the day, no situation is so awful that a character can't find themselves aroused by noticing someone else's ass, or suddenly being aware of the fabric rubbing against their too-sensitive nipples. The world of Richard Laymon is an EC Comic written as a Penthouse Forum letter, where either a violent beheading or a passionate slide into second base (or, not infrequently, both) is only a page-turn away. I suppose I would be fine with that if the sex was sex-positive, but it's frequently squalid, obsessive and more than a tad objectified. It's pretty typical sex-hatey sex, the type usually written by lonely, inexperienced dudes for lonely, inexperienced dudes.Anyway, let's move from the general to the specific. If I don't like Richard Laymon, why did I pick up Funland? The honest answer is, it appears to be one of the few books of '80s horror available on the Kindle at what I consider to be a fair price. (In fact, I believe I picked it up as a Deal of the Day for $1.99, which is better than fair.) I'm all for the writer and publisher seeing the maximum return on their royalties, so I don't begrudge any professional author or publisher for not charging less than $2.99...but a lot of the books from that era really shouldn't be charged more than that, either. They were designed to be disposable reads at disposable prices. Anyone who reads this book more than twice either needs a life or professional counseling.All that said, as a non-fan of Laymon, Funland is probably the most enjoyable book of his I've read. Although the book's view of humanity is still smutty and dismal, it's not as unrepentantly smarmy and shitty as some of his other books I've read. (Although, as always, Laymon always makes sure to save an extra dollop of disgust for the overweight girl who's interested in sex, which I always find depressing.) It probably helps that Funland takes a chunk of its central conceit from actual occurrences in the '80s--during a brief period where Santa Cruz teens terrorized the homeless--and Laymon works his plot to make sure there are at least one or two good characters on each side of the conflict, as well as a fair share of maniacs on both. I also have to say Laymon does a great job of catching and describing the Santa Cruz boardwalk in the boardwalk of his fictional \"Boleta Bay.\"And Laymon takes the time to build his two main protagonists--a male and female cop team who patrol the boardwalk--into more than just libidos with firearms: the couple is kept apart for most of the book by their own efforts to respectfully end the bad relationships they're in with other people. In fact, although the male cop's relationship is with a shrill and unpleasant harridan, the female cop's failed relationship is surprisingly nuanced, and handled with far more care than I've seen in Laymon's other books.Considering this is only one of three romantic relationships portrayed in Funland, I wonder to what extent this book was written by Laymon in part to either extend his audience or extend his own writing range. Although Laymon uses romantic interest as a plot accelerant in his other work, it barely moves deeper than that. But at least for a few pages here and there, he dips his toes in the water of romantic regret and it's surprisingly effective. There are other sections where the author goes overboard with the sentiment and the syrup (you always know it's going to be tough going when one of the characters is a musician and their original lyrics get quoted at length) but I prefer it to the rape-threats and diseased sexual-organ fondling. (I'm a soft touch that way.)By Laymon's standards, Funland is a slow build. In the early pages, people get stalked, grabbed, and swiped by mysterious \"trolls,\" but things cut away before anything gets too graphic or Laymon-esque. (Although this may be because the scenes with homeless people in the daylight give the author enough time to indulge his usual disgust with scabs, sores, stenches, and poor hygiene.) But by the end, the teen trollhunters and the mysterious inhabitants of the shut-down funhouse are thrown into direct conflict with another, and things get as gory and grindhousey as a horror reader would want. The shocks are bloody, cheesy, and occasionally surprising as the author happily rockets things over the top.Like a pungent cheese or a sausage of mystery meat you find floating in a jar of pickled brine, Richard Laymon's work is an acquired taste and any resulting nausea you might feel afterward is entirely your own fault: his books are quite open about what they are, and he is unrepentant about the type of author he is. Chances are good you'll find his work enjoyable in its efficiency and unpretentiousness, or you'll find them crushing in their cynicism, repetitiveness, and cynicism. For me, Funland was a surprising mix of both. Although I suspect that means it's less-than-optimal to either the standard Laymon fan or the dabbler in commercial horror fiction, if you want a few hours of efficient but disposable fiction that edges toward darkness without being utterly nihilistic, this may be an effective way to enjoyably kill some time."}, {"userName": "Jake", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7248181-jake", "userReview": "To tell you the truth, I really wasn't expecting much from this novel.

Overall I enjoyed it for the most part."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5067007-justin", "userReview": "another great laymon novel, I knocked it down a star because of a small thing I didn't like in the ending (don't want to give any spoilers though) and also because parts of it seemed a bit drawn out. despite the length it was an easy book to read though with lots of memorable characters and I enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5919876-anna", "userReview": "Fantastic, never read any books by this author before but I'm hooked!!!"}, {"userName": "Helen Barton", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64671300-helen-barton", "userReview": "Well written, good, fresh plot and characters."}, {"userName": "Mark R.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47081-mark-r", "userReview": "Richard Laymon was an American writer who died over ten years ago, and whose work was unfamiliar to me until I picked up a UK one-volume set of both \"Funland\" and \"The Stake\". After reading \"Funland\", I'll certainly get around to \"The Stake\" sometime soon, but maybe not right this minute. \"Funland\" isn't particularly creepy, but the story is solid, about a group of kids who hang out on the boardwalk at night, in a California beach town, and attack \"trolls,\" the homeless denizens of the boardwalk, who may or may not be guilty of rape, murder, and other various crimes.The kids are brutal, and the scenes of them tormenting the homeless people are cringe-inducing. But the story isn't simply about comeuppance for a bunch of nasty kids; there's quite a bit more to it, and Laymon has no difficulty filling up 450 pages of cops, mischevious kids, freaks, and possible supernatural activity. This is the second book I've read lately wherein an impressionable young man is co-opted by a murderous young woman, the first being \"The Killing Kind,\" by Bryan Smith. Whereas in the Smith book, the protagonist is a generally nice guy who just doesn't know how to say no to a cute, generally homicidal girl, the kid in \"Funland\" is kind of an asshole to begin with. He gained my sympathy almost never, and I'm glad there were other protagonists on whom to pin my hopes."}], "description": "The resort of Boleta Bay is not the carefree place it used to be. A series of unexplained disappearances, and holiday-makers threatened by an army of leering bums, casts a shadow over summer pleasures.
