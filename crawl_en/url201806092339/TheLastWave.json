Flawed yet very realistic, it follows Martha, a woman whose one solace in her otherwise confusing turmoil of life is the sea. She's captivated by the sparkling waves (hence the title, not to be confused with the 1970's Australian film of the same name), and from her first encounter with the ocean up to her eventual death, The Last Wave takes the reader along rapidly from one point of view to the next to paint a strange and somber portrait of a life built atop broken dreams."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "I was immediately drawn to \"The Last Wave\" for several reasons: ....The title made me feel good....The book cover made me feel goodand........I love the water, the beaches....the smells and sound at the beach... the sand. All those 'beach' feelings I get when just walking along the waters edge for miles alone, or the exuberant way my body feels when I swim in the ocean. .....most: This book takes place in England...giving me a hunch the 'emphasis' would not be on 'grazin-in-the-sun', ice cream cones, or beach parties. On one hand, this is a story that centers around Martha, her relationship with the sea, and her family. A tragic-comic story - spanning many years - (1940's to present days; interchanging narrators), with her husband John, who is crumbling with Alzheimer's, the children Harriet and Ian, each with their issues, Martha's parents, (they have issues) and close friends. On the other hand it's a story that centers around the 'sea' and Martha's beach surroundings. the solitude...( an empty beach)....pebbles, stones, rocks, the surf.... shallow waves, large waves, white cliffs, black night sky, dark sea, and jet engine sounds coming from the sea. The water could be unpredictable and could change quickly.The 'sea' became a main character for me. I could taste the salt, feel the chill in the air, and feel the power of the water. The sea had movement --currents changing.....we can't control what it's going to do. There are also many things in life we can't control ....so I was always looking at the family - the tragedies through the eyes of the sea. \"It was a mackerel sky that evening. The clouds were lit from underneath in a blood red hue and the sun bloomed pink like my myrtle blossoms. I felt that somehowthe sea - my sea -knew about my diagnosis and was trying to console me\". It was the sea that gave Martha strength. When her body moved through the water, she let the water cradle her, and most she felt free....'freedom'.....swimming in the wide open ocean. Martha went on the swim the English Channel ten times. She did die of cancer. Her husband John was disoriented, lonely, loss, and childlike. But author Gillian Best never strayed into the sentiment. I laughed and smiled many times. Lots of symbolism throughout the storytelling between the complexities of this family unit and the ocean. \"I knew the tide was coming to greet me, as though I were a long last friend\". There's an elegance about this novel.... quiet, allowing for the waves to have a voice.Thank You Freight Books, Netgalley, and Gillian Best"}, {"userName": "Stella", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1845595-stella", "userReview": "The Last Wave could easily be titled 'The Old Woman and The Sea' as this is the story of Martha and her relationship with the sea/English Channel.Following six decades, this book/story follows Martha and her family and friends and how everything is connected. The writing is beautiful and compelling but honestly, the first chapter was the best. It could have been a short story and I would have been satisfied with just that.Thanks to NetGalley and the publisher for the opportunity to read and review this book."}, {"userName": "Heather Fineisen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6482072-heather-fineisen", "userReview": "This was a five star read for me. I was drawn to the fabulous cover and from the first chapter, I had a lump in my throat. Rarely do books make me cry as they can tend to be over wrought if intensely emotional. The Last Wave strikes the right balance and you get to know each character's story through alternating chapters. And the sea! It's own character, all - consuming for the swimmer, Martha and for the reader. There are many themes here that circle a somewhat dysfunctional family-- aging parents, motherhood. Alzheimer's, terminal illness, obsession--and all are relatable. These characters will pull you in to the story and stay with you after you turn the last page.Copy provided by NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Helen McClory", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1856862-helen-mcclory", "userReview": "This is a book of emotional gutpunches and the smell of the salt air. Personally speaking it was both a delight to read and a wrench - I have family going through some similar illnesses to those suffered by characters in the book (though thankfully their situations are less complicated).

Spanning from the 1940's to present day, this is the story of a family, centered around the matriarch, Martha. When Martha is a young girl she learns to swim and falls in love with the water to the extent that her life revolves around swimming and ultimately crossing the English Channel. When she meets and later marries John, things begin to change as running a household trumps her need to be in the water. Together they raise two children and navigate the choppy waters of family life.John and Martha represent a typical family who face very common struggles, there is a lot of emotion written into this story that is punctuated by the flow of the storytelling through different family members from different times throughout their lives, all while being centered largely around Martha and her swims.For anyone passionate about swimming, this is a fantastic read. For anyone who is not interested in swimming (like myself) this is STILL a fantastic read. The Characters are well written and relatable in a way that makes them feel like an extension of your own family."}, {"userName": "CreativelyRed", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37221450-creativelyred", "userReview": "Beautifully written.

I have always been intrigued (and slightly frightened) by oceans and their unseen depths. This novel gave me an entirely different perspective of the water and the way a person connects with it. The Last Wave is a beautifully written, emotional story about one woman\u2019s remarkable life and her unending connection to the water.This novel traces events across six decades for Martha, her husband and their two children. Steadfast through every moment of this story is Martha\u2019s deep connection to the English Channel. She swims across the Channel ten different times in life. Martha endures several conflicts with family and friends, but her connection to the water never wavers.The novel is told from the perspective of several characters. I really appreciated that despite the fact that Martha was the central element of the novel, you had insight into the thoughts and actions of her family members. It gave a much more rounded perspective of how Martha\u2019s obsession with the sea impacted those around her and at times hurt her relationships. By the time I was finished reading, I was completely invested in every single character\u2019s life.This was a really emotional read. I found myself tearing up more than once. Martha\u2019s character is far from perfect and I may not have agreed with every decision she made, but I think that is why she resonated with me. She is a woman guided by her passion for swimming and the sea and it takes precedence over everything in her life, including her family.I really enjoyed Gillian Best\u2019s writing style. I highly recommend checking out The Last Wave if you are a fan of character driven novels or looking for a thoughtful read.Big thanks to the publisher via Netgalley for the ARC of The Last Wave. It was my pleasure to provide an honest review."}, {"userName": "Rachel Mantas", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52816980-rachel-mantas", "userReview": "What a beautiful book. I love how their relationship is not all fairy tales. Not how things end up in the end, but more meaning what you find out about their little nuances. I really appreciated such a refreshing view on love. That this person in your life does not have to be your only or even biggest passion in life! I also love how Henry's life of love is shown in the novel, as well as Iian's. John may be the most flawed character, but out of the three men in the story, he is the one who finds love, but realizes that she (Martha) deserves to have another passion other than him. Even though Martha does not wish to only be a housewife, from an outsider looking it, it may seem that is all she becomes. Yet John is the person who allows her to. He may be stubborn, stuck in the old ways of life, and not open to his lesbian daughters choices, but at least he steps back, and allows Martha to have the sea. He barely misses a beat at their proposal when the sea steals the ring and he uses Myrtle instead. It was cute how the author ended the story with Myrtle's attempt, and John still feeling like she was there. Made me cry a little when he jumped in for her!"}, {"userName": "Catherine Coles", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6470611-catherine-coles", "userReview": "A family drama set in Dover, England, this novel is spread out over the course of several decades and follows the life of Martha and the people who knew her. Ever since the 1940s, when she was a young girl who accidentally fell off of a pier and into the ocean, Martha has been obsessed with the sea. As a woman with a young family, when she felt burdened by the confines of domestic life, swimming was her escape. Later in life, when she dealt with family estrangements, her husband\u2019s dementia and finally, her own cancer diagnosis, the sea remained her constant companion. A quiet story filled with complex characters, this novel will transport you straight to the beach.

She can't swim. She hits the water and remembers thinking it strange that it hurt so much -- as though she had hit something solid and hard. And cold. From that moment, she was hooked. She went on to swim the English Channel from Dover to Cap Gris Nez, in France, nine times, and the return trip from France to England once. The training, the daily workouts, and the preparations which all culminate in that endurance swim of 21 miles or so which takes just short of 24 hours. Why would anyone attempt this? \"Because it's there\" is the standard answer. It was certainly the answer for Martha and her family. This novel brings the term \"channel swim\" into sharp focus.

Martha has had a lifelong love affair with the sea and has swum the channel several times. I just wasn't grabbed by this and it was confusing on an e-reader as each chapter jumped from different times and different people - certainly keeps you on your toes though.
