Nicu has recently emigrated to the UK from Romania and Jess lives in an unsafe and abusive home. As this book isn't officially released yet, I'll just list the things that really stuck out for me: - the look into Nicu's mind as he navigates his way in a new country and how hard it is to be in an unfamiliar environment and having to learn a new language, especially when no one gives you a chance (as is often the case in this book).- It's also a glance behind those kids who act up in class. I often always thought as a kid, 'Why don't they just stop and do what they're told? Why are they so naughty?' etc., when there is ALWAYS a reason, even if it isn't always apparent to you. Having a look inside Jess's mind on why she did the things that she did was incredibly eye-opening. - the way that teachers treated Nicu was absolutely despicable. Not even giving him the time of day, not even a smile and always assuming the worst of him was absolutely heartbreaking to read. A teacher can literally make or break a student. - It's told in dual perspective and in verse, and to be honest it felt like the wrong format. I honestly don't understand why it was told in verse and it certainly didn't bring anything to the table for me.- Another thing I was unsure about was the writing from Nicu's perspective. It felt almost wrong to be reading the disjointed English and the innermost thoughts of Nicu when he was written by a white man (I'm assuming Brian wrote Nicu). I'm still unsure how I feel about this because while the message of the book is super important, it just felt a little weird to me if that makes sense. - The ending was absolutely gut-wrenching.

The themes of immigration, racism, abuse, and bullying are all very prominent to the story as well. It is a quick read that took me no more than a couple hours. The characters are strong, well-developed and real. While I felt emotions and was invested in the story, I'm still not sure what the authors were trying to say. I can certainly enjoy verse in novels. I loved  One by  Sarah Crossan, but the verse worked more effectively there. It didn't add anything to the story here. And it made things a little more difficult with Nicu's narration since his was written in broken English to begin with. Some passages did feel very powerful like this one:\nWhen I watching television moviesall actorsspeak too speedyfor my comprehending,and I thinkingit be mission impossibleto learn this languagewith fluent.It so much frustratingwhen words can\u2019t escape my head,when peoples notunderstand my meanings.All I wantis for them to see howI am fun,cleverandnice guy.I afraid no oneever know who I am.\nThe story follows two troubled teens whose lives come together in a Reparation scheme they were both put in to avoid criminal records. It is basically community service and self-development sessions. Nicu and his parents emigrated from Romania to England. They are here to earn enough money to pay the family of a bride in Romania and marry Nicu off. Jess lives with her mom and abusive stepdad. Both characters feel stuck in their lives, but when they meet...their lives will change.I love the ending for all it's ambiguity. It would have been nice if there was more of a clear-cut message to take away when such important themes were being discussed. Also, I started the story very confused while trying to figure out who was narrating when. There aren't any names at the beginning or labels on the chapters to let you know who exactly is starting. Once I figured it out, it was fairly obvious. If you enjoy quick stories about friendship that will quite possibly break your heart, you might want to read We Come Apart."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "We Come Apart is a very timely story told in verse, and I liked the two main characters, but I often found the poetry disjointed and scattered, and the ending made absolutely no sense at all.

I can't give it more than three stars though because I had quite a few issues with it. It is such a relevant book though and so I think people should read it. I'll start off with the good! Nicu was a lovely character. He was so adorable and sweet, I loved him! I'm not sure which author wrote Nicu's POV but it was amazing. The author completely submerged themselves into writing this character and I found Nicu was done very well. I would like to know who wrote Nicu so if anyone knows, please comment on my review and tell me! I absolutely adored reading the broken English because Nicu put things in such an unusual way and some of it was really beautiful. So Nicu and the writing of Nicu was spot on for me. Another good thing about this book was the way the racism was portrayed. People were so cruel to Nicu because of his skin colour and because he was Romanian. It wasn't just students who were malicious but teachers and adults too. I don't know how people can be so awful to others just because of their skin colour, their religion or their place of origin etc but that prejudice is everywhere these days. So many people are for Brexit, the Muslim ban, the wall etc because they don't want foreigners in their country. It's absolutely ridiculous and this book portrays just a bit of that hate towards Nicu & his family. The mediocre - the writing as a whole. Verse is usually hit or miss with me. This unfortunately was a miss for me. It just didn't add anything to the book. I did like how it was quick. Verse usually skips all the waffle and jumps right into the story and focuses on what's important so I enjoyed that aspect but on a whole, it was just okay. I also didn't really like Jess. She made it hard to like her but I did feel bad for her. I didn't enjoy her chapters as much as I enjoyed Nicu's. The bad - the ending. I just didn't understand it. Maybe I'm not supposed to understand it but I didn't like the end either. While I was reading this, I felt like something like that would happen but I was hoping I was wrong. I would recommend this book if you're in the mood for a fast young adult book. * I received this book from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Nicu's cute descriptions - \"My hair stick to me like I step out of deep blue sea.\"\"She not believe I am wild animal like other delinquents.

This definitely unsettled both the characters, and me, but I was desperate to know how it was going to end.I also read this with my sister, Bee, and she described it as a modern tragedy, which I think is absolutely perfect, so if that sounds like something you'd like, Romeo and Juliet without the double suicide, then I couldn't recommend this more!"}, {"userName": "Gabriela Pop", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29398103-gabriela-pop", "userReview": "I feel so bad to give this book such a low rating,but rating it any higher would feel like a fraud since my reading experience was terrible and I did not really enjoy it one bit.I understand if people do find it likeable and I certainly can appreciated some of the ideas that the authors tried to get across,but overall I was enraged from page 1.As a Romanian emmigrant myself,I found this rather rare representation of others in this position to be infuriating.Again,I do appreciate some of the things the book tried to explore,such as the issues faced by immigrants and the hardships they faced,but I found this representation to be such a painful,overused stereotype.Never in my life have I questioned my identity before,yet this book made me consider who I am as a person and the role my nationality plays in that and for a short moment it made me question and doubt who I am,which is the lowest I have felt about who I am and where I come from and I'm not sure if I'll actually manage to fully pick myself back up after this.While I'm sure the demographic represented in the book exists and should be represented,I did feel like it was a shameful generalization.Homestly,you mean to imply I worked my ass off getting a diploma of proficiency in the English language and educating myself in all areas that I can just to be perceived as a brute?Because that is disgusting.My personal experience/connection aside,I didn't really care much for the characters,if at all.I also found the writing style to be very bland.Overall,really not my cup of tea."}, {"userName": "Stacey (prettybooks)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3533262-stacey-prettybooks", "userReview": "One is one of my favourite novels ever (seriously, read it). Like One, We Come Apart is told in free verse but, unlike One, we're introduced to two narrators. Jess's home life is tough and Nicu recently emigrated from Romania. When they're both arrested for theft, Jess and Nicu become unlikely\u00a0companions. And Jess's friends \u2013 who throw racist remarks and abuse at Nicu \u2013 won't let them forget it.We Come Apart is very current. It's not about bullying or racism or abuse \u2013 it's about Jess and Nicu \u2013 but we see how these affect the two teenagers' lives. We Come Apart is also incredibly sweet. I love books about friends and We Come Apart sees a close friendship develop at different rates. Nicu wants to know more about Jess once he first sets eyes on her whereas Jess needs a little more convincing about Nicu. Due to the free verse and the book's length, the story is fast-moving and we quickly become wrapped up in the lives of these two underdogs.If a dual-perspective, in my opinion, is done well, we should be able to tell who's speaking without checking. In We Come Apart, there's no need for character headings; it's always easy to tell Nicu's passionate broken English apart from Jess's indignant thoughts. I loved switching between them seamlessly. Poignant, beautiful and captivating, We Come Apart is a short hit straight to the heart.Thank you to the publisher for providing this book for review!I also reviewed this book over on Pretty Books."}, {"userName": "Romie", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33510193-romie", "userReview": "I honestly tried to read this \u2014 I got through more than 30% \u2014 but I some point I had to say stop.This could have been a great story, but I couldn't deal with the broken English.

Although I've also experienced domestic violence as a child, I couldn't relate to Jessica and her often merciless attitude. Having committed her third offense and Nicu caught thieving, the two teens are both sentenced to the Reparation Program, an initiative to rehabilitate adolescents rather than facing prison.Nicu's narrative was captivating. Having migrated with his parents to the United Kingdom, Nicu and his father are self employed in order to earn an adequate dowry to obtain a wife home in Romania. Although his parents are insistent, Nicu refuses to marry and wants to begin his life in the United Kingdom rather than return home. Nicu is absolutely endearing. His character explored the social injustice of racism and race profiling. It was interesting to see the comparison between both parents, Jessica had been arrested due to her third offense and they were treated with respect. Although it was insinuated that her behavior was a result of defective parenting. I appreciate narratives told in verse, with so few words authors are able to captivate readers and Sarah Crossan is a wonderful storyteller who breathes life into her characters. We Come Apart touches on social issues such as domestic violence, racial profiling and racism. Nicu wants to be accepted and I felt Jessica had taken advantage of his affection, often choosing the cruelty of her unreliable friends and choosing not to asset herself and defend Nicu against their racist remarks.I'm fascinated by stories of immigration and seeking asylum, which is the foundation for many Australians in particular. We Come Apart touches on those same foundations and as Nicu explores thoughts of his new surroundings and learning a new language, I'm dubious as to the validity of the representation.We Come Apart is a touching exploration of friendship and transcending barriers of language and stereotypes. Although I became increasingly frustrated with Jessica's character, the narrative was captivating, immersive and representative of our broken societies."}, {"userName": "Emily Mead", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12221873-emily-mead", "userReview": "I'm kind of mixed about this one.

I'll admit, I was intimidated by this book as soon as I found out that it was written in verse. I've never read a book like this and honestly, it was way out of my comfort zone. I always feel like I won't understand what the authors are trying to tell me but I'm glad this wasn't the case here. I finally made up my mind to binge read this before I fell asleep yesterday and I ended up reading it in less than 2 hours. Because of that, I have officially fallen in love with verse books and I can't wait to get my hands on more like it. I loved that the writing worked completely in its favor. It didn't impede the message of the book to get lost in translation and it made me feel just as much as any regular written book ever has. This book is dual POV and it was separated into 3 parts. It follows Nicu, an emigrated Romanian and Jess, as their lives entwine when they are both sent to the same place after getting arrested for stealing. My heart was completely stolen by Nicu from the very beginning and it's not just because he was the male lead. The way he expressed himself quickly told me that he had one of the sweetest and purest of hearts that I've ever come across. His verses were written in poor English which helped bring the story, and his background, to life even more beautifully than it already was. I loved seeing how carefully he chose his words and they were never, ever without a deep meaning. His humor made me smile until it hurt every single time and I just couldn't get enough of him. I saw him as a little brother and I wanted to reach into the pages to comfort him at every turn. I was also really impressed by how Sarah and Brian didn't need to tell us which POV we were reading. Jess and Nicu had their own unique voices that were easily distinguishable. This story deal with a lot of racism, abuse, and mostly everything in between. It tore my heart out whenever anyone so much as thought something negative towards Nicu and it made me tear up more times than I could count. The only reason I didn't give this book a 5/5 was because I didn't care much for Jess. Don't get me wrong, I sympathized with her situation a lot but I feel like her character wasn't as interesting as Nicu. I really liked her relationship with Nicu but I feel like she disappointed me more than not. They both had ugly lives at home and it had my stomach turning with a bad feeling in my stomach throughout it all.With that said, I absolutely despised every other character in this story. I won't go into detail but let's just say that I went into a murderous rage every time anybody besides Nicu and Jess were being mentioned. Now that I have read this from cover to cover, that title is killing me inside. I will always cry and die a little bit every time I hear/see it from now on. Thank you, Sarah and Brian, for writing a book that will stay with me forever. Also, one more comment....

All thoughts and opinions are entirely my own Quotes are subject to my ARC.\u201cWe Never Get LostAndWhen I WakeI fear that our love will never beFound.\u201dI read We Come Apart in one sitting. In fact, I think it\u2019s the quickest I\u2019ve ever read a full-fledged novel. Despite the fact that it was told in verse (like the quote above), We Come Apart was SUCH a different, thought provoking and consuming book to read. In fact, I found it VERY DIFFICULT to NOT put down. I\u2019ve never read a book like this one before \u2013 told in verse, that is (is that what I should call it?) \u2013 Mostly because I never actually thought I\u2019d like it. Poetry has never appealed much to me but after falling for this book, I feel like I should reconsider it. \nREASONS I LOVED THIS BOOK/ FELT ALL THE THINGS:1.\tNICU: \nIt\u2019s very hard NOT to love someone who a) only wants a better life than the almost homeless, below the poverty line life that he was living in Romania before he came to England and b) who only wants to be GOOD, to make a life for himself in this county and BE ACCEPTED. I hated how EVERY SINGLE PERSON, even the adults and HIS TEACHERS judged him based on his language, his accent, his skin colour and the kids abused him and tortured him and yet HE WAS STILL A HOPEFUL FLOWER, because all he wanted was a good life for himself. I especially hated the school kids that beat him up and Meg (UGH) who said he touched her just FOR ATTENTION TO BE ON HER and it broke my heart that there was ALMOST NOBODY that would be nice to him, or cut him some slack.\n2.\tTHE REAL RAMPANT RACISM:\n Students enrolled in US universities after working twice as hard as any \u201cwhite\u201d kid aren\u2019t allowed to return to STUDY. A Minister in India claims he will kill a hundred Muslims for even a single Hindu who dies. WE LIVE IN A HIGHLY RACIST WORLD, and We Come Apart captured the worst of it in a heart wrenching manner. \n3.\tTHE WRITING STYLE: \n Like I said before, I LOVED THE VERSE STYLE OF WRITING. It was a really raw form of writing, that managed to capture all the emotions of the moment and yet it wasn\u2019t a rambling piece. I also loved how Nicu\u2019s language problems were handled because English IS A COMPLICATED language and I smiled and felt for him when he spoke it. The only reason that this isn\u2019t a Five Star Read for me is because:a)\tWE SAW SO MUCH RAMPANT RACISM AND ABUSE (and that was the point of the book, I\u2019m guessing, to see how rampant it was and to see and FEEL what immigrants/ abused kids must go through)b)\tAND YET NOBODY \u2013 NOBODY \u2013 Said ANYTHING to the entitled White British Kids, not even Jess. There was no defining moment to the story that at least TRIED to teach those kids to be better (even if they won\u2019t change) but there was NO TRYING. You\u2019re supposed to say something, right?I guess I just wish that the ending, and the lesson about being conscious about how you treat ANYONE was better put forth.

I just wanted to hug him -- I am not an immigrant (yet -- but I would love to move in the UK in a few years) and I can already feel the hate towards EU worker immigrants on social medias. Even there.

I did really like this book and I rattled through it in a morning. I'm not saying I didn't like it.I don't really know why this didn't blow me away *quite* as much as Sarah Crossan's other books. It had excellent writing (free verse, which, as I've mentioned before, I don't like as a rule, but with Sarah Crossan's writing it just really, really works), it's UKYA, slow-burn romance and massive social issues (racism, bullying, domestic violence, child abuse), but it didn't leave me bug-eyed and gasping for breath like the author's other books do. The only reason I can come up with is that she collaborated with another author, so I wasn't getting pure, unadulterated Sarah Crossan.Still. Please don't think that this wasn't a good book. It really was. I loved the characters, who were very real and human in their failings and I loved the situation, which was horrific and something I didn't think the authors would be able to write their way out of.And they kind of do and kind of don't . One thing I've found about Sarah Crossan's books is that she never gives a neatly-wrapped ending, because her stories are about life, and life doesn't have neatly-wrapped endings.In conclusion, this was a good book. Really good. not my favourite Sarah Crossan book, but still a country mile better than a lot of other books out there."}, {"userName": "Kathy Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3122948-kathy-martin", "userReview": "This novel in verse is told from two viewpoints. Jess is a girl in a bad home situation. Her mother's live-in boyfriend beats her and forces Jess to take videos on his phone. She knows that her mother will take punishment if she does anything to set the boyfriend off. Nicu is a recent immigrant from Romania. He has come with his parents who want to earn enough money to buy him a wife back home. But Nicu doesn't want a wife or to go back home.The two meet as they are doing community service. Both were caught shop-lifting. At first, Jess doesn't want anything to do with him. She likes to be unnoticed and Nicu becomes a person people pick on for his poor English and foreign appearance.Gradually the two become friends who try to lean on each other for support. They have big dreams about getting away together to start a new life. But getting away won't be easy. I enjoyed the working class North London setting. I liked that Nicu had dreams of a happier future but could also understand why Jess couldn't see past her current situation.The combination of gritty realism and verse really made this an interesting story."}, {"userName": "Andrea Tome ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19704674-andrea-tome", "userReview": "So...\u2022 the Romani immigrant POV is written by a white author who decides to mimic his broken English.
