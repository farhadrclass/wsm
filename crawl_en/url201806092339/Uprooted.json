A TERRIBLE DRAGON WHO KIDNAPS A VILLAGE'S BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRLS. DO THEY GET EATEN?! DO THEY GET TORTURED?!!! WHAT IS THEIR TERRIBLE FATE?!\n\u201cThey forget how to live here...[they] remember to be afraid,\u201d my father said. That was all. Then they took their dowry-silver and left. Mostly they would go to Kralia and go to the University. Often as not they married some city man, and otherwise they became scholars or shopkeepers.\n\nAre you fucking kidding me?\n *seethes*I swear to god I'm the only one in the world who didn't think this book is THE BESTEST MOST SPECIALEST WONDERFULEST BOOK EVER. For god's sake, Emily May loved it, and I highly respect her opinion, but this book is one case where we will have to agree to disagree.Frankly, I have no idea why everyone loved this book and thought it was so wonderful. The main character is every bit of a Speshul Snowflake Mary Sue. The \"Dragon\" (so very disappointing) is an asshole of the Fever sort, the kind I deem Jericho-Fucking-Barrons, a term used to describe an asshole who is an asshole only for the sake of being an asshole. He's grumpy, he's grouchy, he is a huge fucking condescending thundercunt of a douchebag just for the plain old reason that he wants to be one.\nHe was irritated with me every time I came into his library, even on the few days that I managed to keep myself in good order: as though I were coming to annoy and interrupt him, instead of him tormenting and using me. And when he had finished working his magic through me and left me crumpled on the floor, he would scowl down at me and call me useless.\nLet's get one thing straight. I like assholes (sometimes), but they have to have character. For example, Dr. House. He is filled with snark. He is a jerk. He's oftentimes despicable, but there's a spark in him, a humanity in him that lets me love him and appreciate him no matter what despicable things that comes out of his mouth, because, under it all (and you seriously have to look deep), he is a human being with a good purpose, no matter how harsh his methods.Once again, I like assholes. I like anti-heroes, but they have to self-redeeming. The \"Dragon\" in this book is none such.Ok, back to the plot. It sucked. I didn't really read the synopsis, but I know there was a dragon who kidnapped girls in it. Surely a terrible fate, right?! EEEEEEEEEEHHHN. Wrong. Look at the quote at the beginning of my review. Essentially the girls are \"kidnapped\" by said \"Dragon\" (keep in mind I used quotation marks around dragon), they're educated, they become well-read, and they want to spread their wings. They're given shit tons of money to make a better life for themselves.Terrifying. Absolutely fucking terrifying. I'm quivering in my boots.The world building is your standard generic fantasy fare. Monsters. Kings. Princes. But the magic. The fucking magic, man.It just highlights what a special freaking snowflake the main character is. There is nothing to catch the imagination. If I shouted out \"Merde!!!!\" and butterflies burst into the air and a rainbow forms at my feet, it would essentially be as magical as the shit in this book.\nI whispered, \u201cKalikual.\u201dThe power rushed out of me.\nForeign words!!!! So magical!!!one!1The main character, Agnieszka, is seriously nothing new. You have read countless incarnations of her in every shitty YA book ever written because she's a special, special girl who doesn't know how special she is. She's just so ordinary and adorably clumsy and plain, y'all! The Dragon always, always takes the most special girl!\nThe Dragon didn\u2019t always take the prettiest girl, but he always took the most special one, somehow.\n:| <- this is my surprised face.And Ag-noying (my new name for her) is just so...so...ordinary!\nAt seventeen I was still a too-skinny colt of a girl with big feet and tangled dirt-brown hair, and my only gift, if you could call it that, was I would tear or stain or lose anything put on me between the hours of one day.\nYou don't say!But of course, there's more to Ag-noying than meets the eye, why, she's got magical power that's just waiting to burst from her like a rose from a fermenting pile of steaming poop.\nMy strength welled up through my body and fountained out of my mouth, and where it left me, a trembling in the air began and went curling down around my body in a spiraling path.\nYeah, yeah. I've read this shit before, and I say no, thank you. I like my main characters average, thank you very much. I like my \"Dragons\" with humanity.1 star is a bit harsh, but for all the hype, this book let me down tremendously."}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Hey! You there! Please listen. On May 19th this book will be released - on that day go to this page or this page or another retailer of your choice and download the free sample of this book. If, by the end of that small sample, you are not convinced that this book is amazing, never think of it again. BUT, I sincerely doubt that will be the case.Because it took me ONE CHAPTER - well, a few pages really - to make me realize that this book was going to steal every bit of my spare time until I'd devoured it all. And it did. It was magical, surprising, incredibly well-written, and so very funny. And not funny in a Terry Pratchett comedy/fantasy kind of way, but just funny because these characters are so real and charming.There are those well-drawn, vivid books that have great world-building, beautiful descriptions without being overly descriptive, and get lauded by critics. Then there are those books that are delicious chocolate-ice-cream-with-sprinkles pieces of entertainment that drag you in and just provide so much enjoyment. Uprooted is a rare beast - because it's both.It's just so goddamn charming. It's exciting and creepy with regards to the plot and world, but it's made especially wonderful because of the character dynamics. Agnieszka and the Dragon are hilarious together - they operate with a kind of love/hate dynamic that makes for some really funny scenes and some heart-warming ones.What a magical, though strangely honest and thoughtful book. I'm avoiding saying too much about the story because the blurb is deliberately vague for a reason, but I will give you a little something. Uprooted opens in a village where once every ten years, the Dragon (actually a man and wizard who rules over the land) comes and picks a seventeen year-old girl from the village and takes her to his palace. Nobody knows what happens to them, but they are not seen for the next ten years and they always come back changed. It made me smile because it sounds a little like the premise for Cruel Beauty (which I loved) and A Court of Thorns and Roses (which I didn't love), but it's better and different than either of those. There's a touch of the romantic (and the heart-poundingly sexy), but Novik is both a tease and someone not concerned about being PG - which made the book infinitely better on that front than either of the other two mentioned. Also, one of my favourite things was the creepy Wood - a literally evil forest that is alive with a dark corruption that will claim you if you ever enter it, or get touched by one of the monstrous beings that come out of the Wood. How weird and creative and scary... I LOVED it.No one went into the Wood and came out again, at least not whole and themselves. Sometimes they came out blind and screaming, sometimes they came out twisted and so misshapen they couldn\u2019t be recognized; and worst of all sometimes they came out with their own faces but murder behind them, something gone dreadfully wrong within.I can't praise this book highly enough. I'm desperately trying to string together the right combination of words to make other people pick this up. I just hope I've been successful, because it was truly a magical, entertaining experience.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "I think this book was uprooted from Heaven\u2019s grounds and magically brought to Earth."}, {"userName": "Rick Riordan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25375513-rick-riordan", "userReview": "I love a good fantasy rooted in folklore, and Novik does a great job mining the mythology of Eastern Europe for this novel. Young Agnieszka lives in a small town in an out-of-the-way valley where nothing much ever happens . . . except for the fact that they live near an evil Wood that occasional swallows trespassers, drives villagers mad, or sends monsters to destroy neighboring villages. Oh, and also they are protected by a wizard called the Dragon who lives in a tower and does his best to keep the evil magic of the Wood at bay. In return for his protection, the wizard takes one girl from the valley every ten years to serve him in the tower. These girls aren't killed, but they are never the same after their ten years of servitude, and they never stay in the valley when they are released. Something about their servitude changes them . . . Agnieszka worries for her best friend, Kasia, who is the most beautiful girl in the village. Everyone is sure Kasia will be snatched up by the Dragon at the next Choosing. Instead, much to her surprise, Agnieszka is chosen to serve the Dragon, and that's when she discovered how dark and frightening the world really is.Novik does a great job twisting our expectations -- inverting the tropes about fairy tale villains and heroes. You'll get magic and monsters, princes and wizards, sorcery and chivalry, but not always in the ways you might expect. Agnieszka has to go through some pretty horrible stuff. In fact, her story got worse so many times I had to put the book down a few times and catch my breath. This trip through the evil Wood is not for the faint of heart. But if you want a fantasy with strong characters and brilliantly original variations on ancient stories, try Uprooted!"}, {"userName": "Evelyn (devours and digests words)", "userReviewDate": "May 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38658747-evelyn-devours-and-digests-words", "userReview": "This book is underwhelming AS FUCK.I'll probably be damned for saying this but screw sugar-coating. This book makes me so angry. Uprooted  is one of those books with a pretty outside look full of sweet promises. Yes, sweet and yet they're EMPTY promises. The book covers scream 'BUY ME NOW OR REGRET IT FOR ALL ETERNITY' and the synopsis is so vague to the point of mystery. It lead me in to having such sky high expectations only later that I have those expectations thrown back into my fucking face.The beginning of the story started out really nicely in a whimsical fairytale sort of way. I thought this will be the next best thing to add into my Favourites shelf. But by the time I reached past 5 - 8% I had already lose my interest and started to wish that I had never, ever bothered with this.How I pretty much sum up the book:  ONE STAR to character developments. I cannot stand any of them. Nearly all of them are as flat as a cardboard cutout. None experienced huge break throughs and if they did, it did not show in the book. The characters are none I can connect with and none I could care less about. My biggest pet peeves is that  Agnieszka suffers a huge case of Special Snowflake Syndrome. She's been picked by The Dragon (who isn't an actual dragon or even a shapeshifter, to my disappointment) out of the blue because she has magical powers. Oh and somehow out of other people, she can survive longer in the Woods. \"You\u2019ve been inexpressibly lucky,\u201d he [The Dragon/Sarkan] said finally. \u201cAnd inexpressibly mad, although in your case the two seem to be the same thing.  No one has gone into the Wood as deep as you and come out whole:  not since\u2014\u201d He halted, and I somehow knew without his saying her name that it was Jaga: that Jaga had walked in the Wood, and come out again.'  *exasperated sigh*  ONE STAR to the ridiculous magic system.  Not only is it ridiculous but it is FLAWED. This is probably just my personal preference but Magic comes with a price and in this case, once you magick something it only drains you bit by bit. It's hardly any price to pay. Some of the characters in the book are sorcerers/witches and they cast spells to make magic. Magic spells with IMPOSSIBLE ways to pronounce.  \"Zokinen valisu, akenezh hinisu, kozhonen valisu.\u201d   \"Ulozishtus sovjenta, megiot kozhor, ulozishtus megiot,\u201d ..... I dont know about you but that all goes 'agskdfsfvslmvdgwddnlkgsljkl' in my head. I refuse to even read the spells properly. I legit have no idea just how Novik expected her readers to read that. ONE STAR for the writing  that is so messy, mediocre and tedious to read. Yes, tedious. It's all tilted to TELLING instead of SHOWING. I also have to endure paragraphs upon paragraphs of useless, unnecessary descriptions. I got so fucking bored I nearly fall dead asleep. There was nothing spectacular about the way Novik writes. ONE STAR to the non-existent chemistry  between the Dragon and Agnieszka. It was bullshit.  ZERO STAR to the love interest.  If there's one thing I really hate, it's romance revolving around verbal and physical abuses. I swear, verbal abusing Agnieszka is the only language the Dragon knows how to speak in. First of all, he insulted her appearances. \"The dirtiest thing in this tower is  you,\"  he said - true but unkind anyway.  annnnd another jab of insult...  \"I do recall the girl neither horse-faced nor a slovenly mess.\"  Yes, he just described her as 'horse-faced' to which Agnieszka retorted....\n \"Then you needn't keep me!\" I flared,  angry and wounded -  horse-faced  stung. \nYet she still fucking fall for him anyway :-))Oh wait, there's more.  The Dragon also insulted her by calling her an idiot every steps of the way.  About more than THREE times in the book.More cases of abuse he showed the MC: 'He was irritated with me every time I came into his library, even on the few days that I managed to keep myself in good order: as though I were coming to annoy and interrupt him, instead of him tormenting and using me.  And when he had finished working his magic through me and left me crumpled on the floor, he would scowl down at me and call me useless' He insulted her plain ways of dressing and forced her to re-dress for HIM in fancy gowns by using magic (which wears out Agnieszka a lot). In the end, she had to crawl on her knees and hands. Yes, he made her CRAWL back up to her own tower, exhausted.Why the fuck would you bother with the way she dressed up herself?  Sarkan, you motherfucking creep. He called her intolerable and crazy in one sentence and then he kissed her. This is only the first kiss. \"You intolerable lunatic,\u201d he snarled at me, and then he caught my face between his hands and kissed me. AWWW. ISN'T THAT JUST SO SWEET, AND SO FUCKING ROMANTIC?!?!?! WOW. I THINK I JUST DIED FROM SWOONING MY SOCKS OFF OVER THIS INSUFFERABLE JACKASS.The sex scene between them both happened out of nowhere and it was sooooo fucking unnecessary. It was like the book decided to throw in a little spice to their almost non-existent relationship. I got so baffled that Agnieszka would throw away her maidenhood over Sarkan whose behaviour do not even fucking improve afterwards.The fact that many gushed over The Dragon disturbed me. This dude is abusive.  ABUSE IS NOT ROMANTIC.  Verbal or physical otherwise. STOP THIS SHIT, AUTHORS. Place yourself in Agnieszka's shoes. Put more imaginations on how YOU would feel if you were being treated like all those ways I pointed out.This one treatment to Agnieszka is particularly the most terrible Sarkan had pulled out of his sleeve.  'He was on me in an instant, thrusting me flat down against my pillows. \"So,\" he said, silkily, his hand pressed down upon my collarbone, pinning me easily to the bed . . . I was terrified . . . He shoved me hard against the bed and bent low.\"Don't dare lie to me!\" he hissed. \"I will tear the truth out of your throat-\" his fingers were resting on my neck; his leg was on the bed, between mine.' How about you go fuck yourself, Sarkan?"}, {"userName": "Maggie Stiefvater", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1246837-maggie-stiefvater", "userReview": "This novel effortlessly conjured up the familiar magic of my childhood favorites \u2014 it was like reaching for a sweater and finding my old worn favorite pushed into my hands.

Because honestly, 5 stars are not enough.Beautiful. That's the word I've been searching for. Uprooted is a \nbeautiful\n book. Naomi Novik narrates the story of young Agnieszka, a constantly unkempt girl who to everyone's astonishment was chosen to live in the dreadful wizard's tower for 10 years as the price for his assistance against the evil Wood. Agnieszka imagined how desperate and empty her life was going to be, locked away from her family and her dear friend with the Dragon as her only company. What she would never imagine was that everything she thought of him was a lie based on fear and prejudice. That magic flew in her veins. That she would play a vital part in the kingdom's politics, that she would participate in the never ending war not only against their neighbors but also against the ancient Wood. The Wood that was calling for her. Aftel all, she was just the woodcutter's daughter. With an unequaled gift for disaster.It sounds like a fairytale, doesn't it? With the witches and the haunted forest and the knights and the brave girl who is about to find out her destiny is a great one and will affect thousands of people? It seems so at first, partly because of Naomi Novik's spectacular writing. The world she created is so vivid and enchanting, you can smell the pines and feel the mud under your bare feet and the air crackling with magic, your stomach clenched with agony and fear, your heart hammering in your chest, and it takes tremendous effort to realize that you are not the one fighting the corruption in Polnya, you are just the reader, in the safety of your house, drinking your chocolate. And you couldn't be more disappointed.But there was darkness in Uprooted that you don't encounter in most of the fairytales. There were brutal murders, desperation, hatred and rage, and the good guys didn't always win. There wasn't a Prince Charming, only a grumpy, sassy wizard who was irritated most of the times and he couldn't remember what being a human felt like. Thousands were slaughtered due to one man's certainty and ambition. And the wizards weren't good or evil, just opportunists, devoid of love. And Agnieszka? A flawed, stubborn girl with a good heart and iron will, unable to hate even her worst enemies, a dedicated friend and daughter, and a different kind of hope. Well that does sound like a fairytale after all."}, {"userName": "Jessica \u2741 \u27b3 Silverbow \u27b3 \u2741 Rabid Reads-no-more", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10336538-jessica-silverbow-rabid-reads-no-more", "userReview": "Reviewed by: Rabid ReadsImagine a powerful sorcerer living in a tower in the middle of a forest. He is over 150 years old, but he still appears to be a young man. Every 10 years, he picks a girl from one of the local villages to take back to his tower. The villagers say nothing, do nothing, b/c the sorcerer protects them from the Wood.The villagers don't know what happens to the girls during their time in the tower, only that they come back changed. Grander, finer, more polished. Educated and dressed in fine clothes. Different.The girls are well paid for whatever it is they do in the tower. Alone with the wizard. In the middle of the Wood. When they've served their sentence, they return with a sack of silver to use as a dowry, but they don't marry. At least not anyone from their former home. They all leave, using the money to finance a fresh start somewhere else.This sorcerer, called the Dragon, is alone except for the village girl, and even with her, he maintains his distance. She will age. She will die. He will do neither. Rather than forming attachments to impermanent creatures, he buries himself in order and precision and the resulting beauty of a task well done.His nature is taciturn, impatient, and formal, so the villagers, despite their dependence on him for protection, fear him, despise him:\nI had hated him, but I wouldn't have reproached him, any more than I would have reproached a bolt of lightning for striking my house. He wasn't a person . . . \nAgnieszka is the antithesis of this sorcerer, this Dragon. Left to his own devices, he would never have chosen her as his new companion, but Agnieszka has magic, and the King's Law states that any found with the talent must be trained, so choose her he does.What follows is a compelling combination of stagnation and rebirth, misunderstandings and revelations, the fantastical and the horrific, and all of it is utterly captivating.Tired literary devices felt new again:\nShe kissed me again and held me once more, and let me go. It did hurt more. It did.\nI found myself reading and rereading the various passages. More than an image clearly formed in my mind, I felt what Agnieszka felt. I could have been her:\nI had forgotten hours and days by then. My arms ached, my back ached, my legs ached. My head ached worst of all, some part of me tethered back to the valley, stretched out of recognizable shape and trying to make sense of myself when I was so far from anything I knew. Even the mountains, my constants, had disappeared. Of course I'd known there were parts of the country with no mountains, but I'd imagined I would still see them somewhere in the distance, like the moon. But every time I looked behind me, they were smaller and smaller, until finally they disappeared with one final gasp of rolling hills.\n Novik perfectly captures human nature, plucking you from the physical world, and dropping you next to Agnieszka, making you an observer from within, so much more than a girl in a chair reading a book in Tennessee:\n\"I'm glad,\" I said, with an effort, refusing to let my mouth close up with jealousy. It wasn't that I wanted a husband and a baby; I didn't, or rather, I only wanted them the way I wanted to live to a hundred someday, far off, never thinking about the particulars. But they meant life: she was living, and I wasn't.\nAnd beyond the simple beauty of her words, she creates real, believably flawed people characters.Marek is a prince, not the crown prince, and he has no qualms about making his displeasure on that topic known, and when I met him . . . I didn't know what to think. He behaved abominably, but in a way that he himself wasn't absolutely abominable. Just self-interested. But redeemable. Until he isn't. Then suddenly you have hope for him again.It was a cycle that I completed several times, and in the end . . . I'm still undecided. But he was real. And he was one among many.Kasia is Agnieszka's best and only friend. She is also the girl that everyone expected the Dragon to choose. So imagine my dismay when shortly after she escapes that fate, she is abducted by one of the Wood's foul creatures. Now imagine Agnieszka's dismay.If you want to know whether or not Kasia is saved, you'll have to read the book for yourself (which you should do anyway, b/c AWESOME), but I will tell you that Agnieszka finds something in the Wood, and that something reminds me of one of my favorite Christian Schloe illustrations:Fantastic(al), right? The whole book is like that.UPROOTED by Naomi Novik is part fantasy, part fairy story, and all wonder. I haven't been as enamored by a tale since I was child, and though this is not a children's story, I still found myself smitten like a girl with ribbons in her hair, twirling in her favorite dress in the sunshine. This is a story that has carved it's place on my heart, and I enthusiastically endorse it as my top read of 2015."}, {"userName": "Navessa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa", "userReview": "WOW. I need to create a new shelf and label it \"all time favorites\" and put like three books on there, of which, this would DEFINITELY be one. What an incredible fairy tale. This book is a lot like the The Wood that dominates this story, luring you close, whispering in your ear, offering you the most tantalizing temptations, if only you'll be persuaded into it. The difference between the two is that where The Wood is a dark, twisted creation that speaks only lies, this book delivers on its promises. It's as if Novik sprinkled real magic within these pages. As if the words written on them are spells in and of themselves, able to lift from the paper and ensnare those who read them. I'll freely admit that I was immediately caught within its grasp, and remained spellbound from beginning to end. If you're a fan of beautifully crafted stories, slow burn romances, hideous monstrosities that are somehow all too human, and good triumphing over evil, read it.

Well I have and it sucks. It leaves you feeling rather torn in a review. So, I\u2019m going to tear my review in two and review the two halves separately. Here goes: First Half- A lovely magical friendship- 4*In the beginning I had a real reason to carry on reading. The character known as the Dragon was a complete enigma. Discovering what drove this lonely man was, essentially, the reason I carried on with the book. He\u2019s such a cool guy. Well at least by my standards. The man locks himself in his immense library and reads all day. Now isn\u2019t that just fun? I love reading about characters that read, and appreciate books in the same way that I do. I find them quite compelling. But, he is also terribly moody and dismissive to his young student Agmeszka. So I wanted to know what was giving this man a sore head. Every ten years he recruits a new student from the local village. He usually picks the most attractive girl or her who is remarkable in some way. Ok, so that\u2019s a bit of a dickish move. He takes the woman home where she becomes his live-in-maid. Ok, so he\u2019s getting worse. See what I mean:\u201cHis name tasted of fire and wings, of curling smoke, of subtlety and strength and the rasping whisper of scales. He eyed me and said stiffly, \"Don't land yourself into a boiling-pot, and as difficult as you may find it, try and present a respectable appearance.\u201d This year he fancies a change. He pics the most ordinary girl out of the lot; she appears to have nothing special about her. When he goes back to his wizard tower he leaves her to her own devices. And whoa! Would you guess it? She turns out to be a magic wielder too. She starts reading his books, very intimate I know, and discovers a strange affinity for the craft. ^This great pic summarises a lot. It's perfect. This was my favourite part of the novel. The two characters discover their compatibility and worked together to create new and interesting magic\u2019s. But, the downside is that it was over far too quickly. This novel did not feel like a stand-alone fantasy. For me, it had the potential to be an epic fantasy series, with this being the beginning. Instead it was over far too quickly as the recently acquainted characters were thrown into the action that became the second half.Second half- Then everything turned upside down- 2*The plot then took a weird direction. The world expanded far too quickly. The story went from being isolated to a tower to reaching across the entire lands, and even as far as to affect the random monarchy. The beginning was slow, perfectly so, then it rushed into world events and kingdoms and rulers all too quickly. I do like the idea behind this book, but there was no build up as the story expanded. The novel just had too much story for one book and it felt condensed as a result. This could have easily been split into two. Structurally, the author made a few mistakes in my estimation. This book would have been far more effective had the friendship at the start been allowed more time to develop. It was thrown into the action that much, that when the romance came it made no sense. It didn\u2019t have time to work; it just sprung and left me feeling a little surprised. It was a case of where did that come from? I think there should have been much more time spent in the tower, as the rest of the world was slowly, and gradually, revealed. That way this could have easily ended at the midway point.So let\u2019s talk about the woods. The woods are the antagonist in this story. It\u2019s a novel idea, one that made this feel like a dark fairy tale. I loved that; it worked. It more than worked it was rather brilliant. But it could have been better. I think a prelude demonstrating the dark nature of it would have helped to establish it as a real threat, rather than an irrational fear, very early on. Then there\u2019s how the wood ended. Now that was so very disappointing! It was too fast. One minute the wood is practically an invincible enemy, the next it\u2019s defeated in vague circumstances. It was just too fast to be effective!>Final thoughts - So, I\u2019ve criticised this a great deal. I did like the story, but for me it took a terrible wrong turn which severed my enjoyment. This could have been so much more; it was just over far too quickly. One book wasn't enough to tell this tale in. I think three stars is a fair rating, all things considered."}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "This was another favourite of mine. Completely different to A Court of Thorns and Roses and Cruel Beauty, Uprooted is more dark and gothic. Unfortunately there is also a lot less kissing. But not to be discouraged. What kissing there is, is very lovely and, more importantly, Uprooted has a solid plot and is paced with ardent fervour. It\u2019s also funny as all hell and sit-on-the-edge-of-your-seat type of action-packed. When I started reading it, I really didn\u2019t want to put it down unless forced against my will. Agnieszka is a fantastic character. Witty, strong, loving and heroic. The Dragon is hilariously uptight and poncy. Cue Agnieszka quickly tearing down every expectation and wall he builds up between them and you have an odd couple taking on the most sinister forest you can think of.It\u2019s brilliant.This is a mini review since I posted a guide to Beauty and the Beast retellings here."}, {"userName": "Melissa (Ever So Mela)", "userReviewDate": "Aug 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28640648-melissa-ever-so-mela", "userReview": "It's nor here nor there. I'm going to steal a bit from Chester and say this is the epitome of Blur Rating. Are you one of those readers who really gets fed up with series?It's like every corner you turn, every book you read, you find out it's a trilogy. Or some kind of saga. I remember I used to whine and cry about this all the time because I don't know about you but if I read a book today you can sure bet your butt that I will not remember details about it in two months time unless it was utterly epic, and even then. And unlike most readers, I refuse to reread so I trudge on to the next book most of the time not knowing what the heck is happening until my memories resurface or a friend (usually Brit) so kindly refreshes my mind.You may be asking yourself, why the heck is Melissa blabbering on about series and trilogies?Well, because this book made me appreciate them. It dawned on me, that some plots just need to be turned into a saga because smashing them into a 400 page book is like forcing a size 9 foot into a 6 inch 7 1/2 size heel. It's murder. Cold blooded murder. This novel is too dense. It's too layered and runs from one plot to another without giving us time to digest the previous one, making this one tough cookie to swallow. When it's not the overly descriptive surroundings, it's the tedious never ending rendition of magic, one that, by the way, still left a lot to be desired. See, that is one thing I'm able to appreciate from the Throne of Glass series. I'm not its biggest fan (having actually only really enjoyed the second book) but I was able to enjoy how the plot thickens and gets layers added as the series progresses but if you try to do that in such a short novel, it just becomes hard to swallow and digest. But at the same time, if it wasn't going to be written into a series, than this needed to be slimmed the heck down cause I just read 3 stories in one. I mean, I know this is only 440 pages or so and I've read longer books in one sitting but daaaamn at times this book read like a textbook. And ain't nobody got time for that. As for the writingYou know how some authors have a way of writing in a lyrical and slow paced manner but when you enter an action scene they have a way of making your heart pound and adrenaline sky rocket. That art of being able to make your breathe hold still and your anxiety hit the roof?...This one doesn't.\nA friend had previously warned me about the writing style but I did not heed caution cause in my mind you don't have to be a poet to woo me. But crap, you at least have to have some finesse. As for the magicLook, honestly I'm not one to fidget about this. I usually don't care and they don't necessarily have to have some kind of system or consequence theme going on but, honestly? This magic was weird as heck. There was times she used spells but most of her magic was some sort of weird ass humming. If she wanted a twig to turn into a tree she would go...\nhmmmm...you are a tree, you have leaves. You grow branches...You are a tree...grow...grow...You are a tree and have leaves and branches...You are a tree...hmmm\nOk, so that may not be an exact rendition but that sure is as close to it as it comes. As for the romanceJust no. I can honestly say this is one of the worst romances I've read in a book. You know when reviewers rant about the lack of chemistry between characters? Well my friends, here it wasn't even a lack of it,  it was a total absence!When I got to the scene where he kissed her I was just...Where the heck did that come from?!?! The romance sucks and not just because of the absolute lack of chemistry but because he never backpedals on being a total unrelenting inconsiderate jackass. Like I said...Just no.As for the charactersIn all honesty? I just liked the Wood and I'm not really sure if that's a character. But as for Sarkan (who was always snapping, glaring, and growling, reminded me of my rabid chihuahua) and A-jkidhl (because you can't honestly expect me to recall her name right?)Sooo this just got awkward cause all I remember are the cons. But there are pros, I just can't really remember them. I mean, it couldn't have been that terrible, I did finish it, so there's that. Also, the story is good but I just didn't like how it was told. And the Wood is creepy (not buts here). Yeah...I'm shutting up now.P.S. Also, this actually the first book I finished this month. So YAY me! I will conquer you, you neverending slump!"}, {"userName": "Robin Hobb", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17730703-robin-hobb", "userReview": "I read Uprooted as an ARC or Advance Reading Copy. I promise that I do not review books I have not read.This tale does have a distinctly fairy tale aura to it, but not in the sense of that distance we get from a tale when characters are The Princess or The Younger Son. Instead, this is a tale that the reader steps into, and experiences with the viewpoint character. I'm going to tap dance around spoilers as I loathe and despise them, to instead point out that I loved the distinctive names of the characters, names that definitely gave them a flavor of our world but at the same time gave me that feeling that I'd just discovered a very old tale that was set outside the realm of the familiar tales I know by heart.This story was not afraid to have a bit of silliness in it, and the flashes of peculiar humor that we so often encounter in our own lives. And it also did not wince from peering into the darkness that always waits at the edges of old tales.

The main character is Agnieszka, a 17 year old village girl who is chosen by the local wizard, called the Dragon, to be his servant for ten years, the latest in a long string of local girls who each serve the wizard for a decade, emerging at the end somehow changed. Agnieszka turns out to be both more and less than the Dragon expected, with powerful but rather uncontrolled magic of a nature that no one alive has ever seen before, and they both become deeply embroiled in the Dragon's ongoing battle against the Wood. Everyone fears the Wood. It encroaches on the valley further each year, or tries to. Those who go into it never are seen again, or worse, they emerge corrupted, evil and murderous. Sometimes it sends out wolves whose bites will kill or corrupt, or huge walking stick monsters that kidnap villagers and take them into the Wood.The descriptions of different types of magic were fascinating, especially as Nieszka learns to work with her own unique brand of magic, and to combine her magic with the Dragon's (who is offended by the unruliness of her magic): I shut my eyes and felt out the shape of his magic: as full of thorns as his illusion, prickly and guarded. I started to murmur my own spell, but I found myself thinking not of roses but of water, and thirsty ground; building underneath his magic instead of trying to overlay it. I heard him draw a sharp breath, and the sharp edifice of his spell began grudgingly to let mine in. The rose between us put out long roots all over the table, and new branches began to grow.The last third of this book absolutely put me through the wringer. I felt like I'd been through a horrific war and fighting evil and corruption myself. It's not for the faint of heart, and the death and horror went on for long enough that I considered lowering my rating. It's difficult reading. But in the end, the book as a whole impressed me enough that I have to keep it at the full five stars. I give it a strong but qualified recommendation. It's not for young readers (even though it has a 17 year old protagonist; I'd say 17 is about the youngest age I'd consider recommending this book to, and only if quite mature) or for those who can't stomach reading about creepy evil things or gruesome wartime violence. It also helps if you like fantasies of the folk and fairy tale variety.Uprooted is beautifully written, with an unusual setting and a great set of characters, realistic and flawed but admirable. There's a wonderful, touching, layered relationship between Nieszka and her friend, Kasia. It explores good and evil, love for friends, family and nation, and other complex themes in a nuanced way. One of my favorite fantasy reads this year.I received an ARC of this ebook in return for an honest review through NetGalley.

From the opening paragraph this story grabs and hauls you off into the wonders of darkly wooded world and just as sincerely holds you captive. Ms. Novik did everything right here. There\u2019s no learning curve, as the story starts small, simple, and yet captivating. The the reader is introduced to a pleasant and likable young woman, whose life is drastically altered, not in some horrible way, but rather in an unexpectedly nice way. Such things don\u2019t usually happen in fantasy stories. Nice characters, nice places, pleasant events\u2014almost sounds boring, only it isn\u2019t. Quite the contrary, I was far more fascinated and riveted by this not-miserable place and kindly people than in any other fantasy book I\u2019ve read in decade. Uprooted is a modern day Grimm\u2019s fairy-tale, and not the toothless Disney sort but the kind woven to keep kids out of the forest. And while the story is not for children, and can get dark at times, this is a far cry from the more popular mainstream literary message that the world is awful, and it is best to screw your friend before your friend screws you. Instead Novik's tale depicts good people struggling to win against evil. Where it differs from traditional fantasy is in its honest depiction of the slippery nature of both good and evil, and how they aren\u2019t always so easy to recognize, until it\u2019s too late, and even then\u2026"}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "[ <--Totally a word...I swear! *gives the finger to spellcheck* (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Robin (Bridge Four)", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14105531-robin-bridge-four", "userReview": "[there was a not so fade to black sex scene (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Emily (Books with Emily Fox)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58160628-emily-books-with-emily-fox", "userReview": "DNF at 241.I just can't bring myself to finish this book.

When I DNF a YA book, I expect to DNF it in a blaze of glorious ranting, not in a blaze of glorious snoring. Damn you, you Crappy Books Gods! If you are going to put me through a Freaking YA Novel, you could at least give me something to rage about. But no. That would be too considerate of you. You are nothing but a cruel and merciless bunch, so all I am left with is a sleeping pill of a book. No kidding. This book was so slow-paced, boring, uneventful, dull and flat (sorry, I'm out of synonyms) that I thought I'd never wake up from sleeping reading it. Dear gaaaawwwwdddd the never-ending descriptions nearly killed me. I never want to read about a forest. Ever. Again. Not a single word. I've read enough forest descriptions to last me a lifetime. Or two. What is really ironic here is that I actually like Novik's writing. I mean, Temeraire, people! Temeraire!! Unfortunately, neither Temeraire nor Laurence were available to come and rescue this book. Life really sucks. So what exactly do we have here? Don't ask me, I have no idea. I mean, it's not like anything happened during the first 31% of this book. Besides some silly girl forever staining her clothes while cleaning and cooking that is. And being ridiculously clumsy (you are so right dear my friends, this does not read like YA. AT ALL). And being generally silly. But since she's a silly girl, that kind of makes sense. Somehow. But hey, it's not all bad. Nope. Because we also have the annoyingly annoying dragon-not-really-dragon-still-more-or-less-dragon-please-give-me-a-break guy and his never-ending spells from death. I mean, it takes him such a long time to say some of his spells that his enemies have the opportunity to skewer him ten times over while he does it. Mr Dragon Wannabe, you better work on your efficiency skills. Talk to Kate Daniels, she'll teach you a thing or two about power words. No, you silly, not power sentences! Power WORDS. Not only does the annoyingly annoying give-me-a-break dickhead guy totally lacks summarizing skills, he also has the delightful tendency to awaken the homicidal maniac in me. If I'd punched him every time he insulted or put the silly girl in residence down, I'd be in the hospital with a broken hand right now. But he'd probably be dead, and that would be highly satisfying \u2190 Hey, I got myself a mini-rant! Go me!Anything else? Apart from the fact that the story is horrifyingly fairy tale-ish, you mean? As if that wasn't bad enough! I mean, a fairy tale, people!!! Do you want me to die or something?! Most of the time this felt like I was reading Beauty and the Beast *shudders* And no, Novik throwing in a supposedly creepy forest (watch me quiver with fear) and some nearly-dead people who might (or might not) be nearly dead (wow, the suspense is killing me) doesn't change the fact that I don't remember what I was going to say. And that's it. Because I have nothing else to say because nothing happened because I was too bored to care because last night a forest description killed a book. Slooooooooowwwwwwly.PS: my one regret about this? That I didn't make it to the supposed sex scene that is supposedly the reason why people say this supposed YA novel is supposedly not YA. Wait.

No lesser being could create such an unique and magical book such as Uprooted.I'll admit, though. I didn't particularly love this book as much as I expected. Don't get me wrong--it's a BRILLIANT book (all-caps worthy!), but I had trouble getting into the book because it was HUGE. And I'm just a measly little girl. What I mean is big books often intimidate me, so it took a while for me to find time to continuously read it.I guess the writing had something to do with it, too. I mean, it was elegant and definitely made the book feel like a high fantasy story, but there were times when it felt just a tad bit too wordy for me. Or maybe it's just my short attention span speaking.Other than those two minor qualms, Uprooted was pretty much perfection. It had all the aspects I loved in a fantasy--a strong heroine, a unique plot, a creepy world--everything!Agnieszka (bless Goodreads for being there to help me remember names) is basically the heroine we've all been waiting for. She's physically imperfect (her love interest compared her to a horse at one point) and is clumsy, messy and is just all over the place. She's the kind of heroine that'll make you go, \"OMG! I can relate!\" You're going to love watching her grow as a character.Her badass-ness was highlighted by the epic world she lived in. The world-building in this book was incredibly atmospheric. It had this dark yet whimsical feel to it that made you want to be in that world, but made you want to shy away from it at the same time. Plus Naomi's gorgeous writing made it even more vivid than it already was.Because we have a different heroine and a different world, we also have a different antagonist. Hell, our antagonist isn't even a person! And the best part is, despite her (it?) not being a human, she (it??) still had a lovely and enchanting backstory. You'll be confused whether or not you want to root for her (it???) or not--that's how fabulous this aspect was.While this book focused a lot more on character development and world-building, we were given a slight romance... But fear not--it was still very ship-worthy. You will just want to grab Agnieszka's and the Dragon's faces and smoosh them together! There's this fabulous steamy scene too, as a bonus. *wink*Basically, you need to read this book if you want to experience reading a book that's truly unique, one-of-a-kind, and is excellently-written.Deadly Darlings | The Social Potato | The Book Geek | Twitter | Instagram"}, {"userName": "C.G.

Honestly, I was feeling a bit of trepidation before reading this, and I'm very happy to say that I didn't have any issues with the novel.What? No issues at all?No, not really. I honestly enjoyed opening characterizations, all focused more upon the hopes and the realistic expectations when it came to the Dragon who may or may not be an evil nobel/wizard, and I enjoyed the bait and switch enough that I just got suckered into the rest of the story despite all the old resonances of plot and myth.Instead of being tired, though, I actually looked forward to learning the magic and discovering how all of it worked, or didn't work in her case, and I plainly enjoyed the dichotomy as it revealed itself. Words and reason versus song and intuition.Of course, it wasn't the dichotomy alone that made it special. It was the interwoven dualism of both and the harmony that both deep learning and a trust in instinct can form together.As a love story, it's mild and cute. As a retelling of the evil forest mythos featuring Baba Yaga (or Jaga in the text,) it's strong as hell and always on target. As a story, it had strong plots and steady progression, right down through the training, to the introduction to the kingdom, to the Main Reversal, to the Next Reversal, to the dire oh-shit-this-has-gotten-crazy reveal.I'll tell you right now: I was rather a bit upset that the big bad is an evil forest, but the idea is much older than all our modern tree-hugging sympathies, so in effect it still came across as something fresh. How odd!I was entertained to the very last page and so damn happy that I got to read this.Of course, strangely enough, I hadn't even considered reading it until I learned that it was nominated for the Nebula, and now I feel rather more than vaguely embarrassed. Shame on me!Barring any upsets on my upcoming short-list for the Nebula, I think this one is going to be second favorite of the bunch.The Fifth Season still leads, followed closely with Uprooted. I've still got a few other titles to read, but I can tell you that Ancillary Mercy will be somewhere in the middle and Updraft will trail at the bottom.Let's see how Raising Caine, The Grace of Kings, and Barsk: The Elephants' Graveyard fare, shall we? :)Update 4/27/16Not only has this novel been nominated for the Nebula, but it has also been nominated for Hugo for 2016 as well!I'm putting this one at my number two position in both, simply because my number one pick also has been nominated in both, but I'm doing it for the same reasons, either way. I love Uprooted, but I love another more. It sounds like a love triangle, I know, but, alas, truly, it's not. For one, neither book loves me back.

The author has built the book's world on the Polish culture and folklore of her family background, and this gives Uprooted a depth and authenticity that enhances the story all through.

It has everything I could ever want in a book and is just so perfectly balanced. Having said that, it was surprisingly difficult to write a review for this novel. The thing I loved most about Uprooted was the feeling it gave me. How do you describe that? Uprooted was both unlike anything I\u2019ve read before and yet oddly familiar. Throughout the book I kept wondering why, why I knew this feeling and then I realized it was the same emotion I get when I watch a Studio Ghibli movie. If you haven\u2019t seen my bio then let me tell you: I ADORE Studio Ghibli. Hayao Miyazaki films are my childhood. So if I say Uprooted felt like watching one of those movies then that means A LOT. The movies have this perfect balance of whimsical fairy tale, crazy imagination and creativity that makes you go \u201cwho on earth would ever think of that?\u201d, paired with flawed, human characters that keep the story grounded. And Uprooted is exactly like that too. In fact, the book was reminiscent of Howl\u2019s Moving Castle and had elements (or rather one big element, the Wood) of Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Winds but still felt completely original.The book managed to be simultaneously charming, creepy, suspenseful and romantic. The story opens in a village where 17-year-old Agnieszka has been living with her family all her life. Things can be difficult however, because there is a dangerous Wood nearby that corrupts people if they come into contact with it. In order to keep the Wood at bay, the villagers rely on the help of the Dragon, a powerful wizard. As compensation for his efforts, the Dragon demands a tribute: every ten years he picks a girl and takes her to his castle where she will serve him for the following ten years. The other major thing I loved about Uprooted was how much I\u2019ve been waiting for a book like this. If you would have asked me to write a list of all my bookish pet peeves, then given that list to a great author and asked them to write my perfect book, Uprooted would have been the result. The characters:Agnieszka is our protagonist and she is wonderful. She isn\u2019t your typical fantasy heroine; instead she is physically plain (a fact which is stated numerous times throughout the novel), clumsy and always a mess. She constantly gets herself into trouble. But she is also kind and heroic and I found myself rooting for her from page one. Then we have the Dragon. Aloof and ambitious, meticulous and uptight. The perfect counter-balance to Agnieszka. Having those two together in one room screams conflict. And conflicts they had. It was great. It was hilarious. And let us not forget Kasia, Agnieszka\u2019s best friend. Yes, you read correctly, the best friend is actually important. The relationship between these two was so heart-warming. Kasia is beautiful, graceful and brave, everyone loves her and yet, Nieshka doesn\u2019t feel bitter. She loves Kasia and wouldn\u2019t hesitate to sacrifice herself to save her and vice versa. Their relationship was beautiful but also realistic; I loved it. World-building and writing:The world-building in this book was fantastic. Firstly, there is no learning curve, the story starts small and expands slowly and subtly, we are never bombarded with information. This is great for people who aren\u2019t used to reading a lot of adult fantasy novels. Secondly, this novel creates incredible atmosphere that makes the story even more captivating. Naomi Novik based the world on Polish culture and folklore, which added another layer of originality and authenticity to the whole. The world was dark and whimsical and coupled with Novik\u2019s beautiful writing this book is a bit of a masterpiece. The magic:I loved the way magic was portrayed in this book. It was very fairy tale like but it worked. Other books wouldn\u2019t have been able to pull off this kind of magic system. It can be argued that there weren\u2019t enough limits, that there wasn\u2019t enough of a price to pay, but I was fine with that because a) there was no deus ex machina and b) the villain was so freaking powerful that we still got all that delicious suspense and \u201cOMG, WHAT IS HAPPENING?\u201d feeling. Which brings me to my next point.The villain:I am honestly so sick and tired of reading fantasy novels with the same villains over and over again. There is always an evil king or queen who wants to rule the world and has no conscience etc. But here we have something completely new to the fantasy genre: A villain that isn\u2019t even human but A WOOD. It was creepy, it was dark, it was unexpected. It can get into people\u2019s heads, you never know where you\u2019re at, who to trust. What is scarier than that? Overall:Uprooted was a fantastic book. I can\u2019t recommend it enough.

Thankfully, I FREAKING LOVED THIS. Uprooted tells the tale of a clumsy, plain girl named Agnieszka (Pronounced 'Ag-Nyesh-Ka'. Thankfully I often read author notes first, so I knew how to pronounce it) who lives in a village protected by a wizard who goes by the name/title Dragon. The Dragon lives in a tower and protects the surrounding villages from the evil, corrupt Wood and once every ten years, comes down and picks a girl from one of the villages to come and live with him. Nobody knows what happens to them over those years but when they come back to their families, they are changed. Beautiful, talented Kasia was supposed to be picked by the Dragon, so everybody is astonished when the clumsy, plain Agneiszka is picked instead.While Agneiszka was clumsy and \"plain\", I found her character to be utterly delightful. Neiszka is funny, good natured and SHE'S JUST SO CUTE. She soon discovers she is a witch and she seems to have an affinity with nature and is quite eccentric compared to many other wizards, including the Dragon, who by contrast is very uptight and restrained. The other girl, the one who was MEANT to be picked by the Dragon because she's talented and beautiful, is a fantastic, strong character whose friendship with Neiszka is supportive and uplifting to read. Overall, the characters are incredibly real and each of them have their flaws and quirks and it's so refreshing!The crux of this story is magic and it's absolutely wonderful. Here and there we would get these gorgeous scenes of magic being cast and I often reread them over because the imagery was beautiful. We get to see Neiszka learn more and more about magic and how it works for her. Seeing her learn spells and magic is one of the main reasons I loved this book so much and the magic was written wonderfully. I found the writing absolutely gorgeous and I adored it. It was beautiful, unique and whimsical, but also very descriptive (if you don't like descriptive writing, this book might not be for you). While I could have easily read this book in a sitting or two, I found myself wanting to take my time to enjoy it because I enjoyed the writing so much. I'm going to be vague with this as I think if I said too much, it would be spoiling the experience. But the Wood was delightfully creepy. It's literally an evil forest that is the 'villain' of the story, it's terrifying and an ever constant threat to the people who live near it. If someone is taken by the Wood, or comes into contact with one of the horrifying creatures that live in it, that person becomes corrupted too. It's such an original, creative idea and it was executed incredibly well!The romance in this novel was VERY slow burning but oh my god, what we got in the way of sexy times WAS FANTASTIC. Novik seriously knows how to write some steamy scenes. So yeah, this book basically blew me away. I initially borrowed this from the library as I was unsure but looks like I'm buying it in hardcover because it was so wonderful and magical to read. While this review is pretty vague, I didn't want to give anything away as I went into this pretty much blind and I loved every minute of it. However, as I said earlier, if you're not a fan of descriptive writing then you *might* not enjoy this book as much, but I implore you to give it a go. It's one of my new favourites.For more bookish things from me, check out my Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/flippingthr..."}, {"userName": "Carol. ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3978225-carol", "userReview": "Once upon a time, I read myths, folktales and fairy tales. Thankfully, this was way back before Disney was ubiquitous, so I subsisted on Andrew Lang\u2018s The [Color] Fairy Books, Ruth Manning-Sanders\u2018 Book of [Magical Creature]s. And even Hans Christian Andersen and the Brothers Grimm, though they were usually devoid of the embellishment I enjoyed. Uprooted brought back the memory of those days, of reading an unfamiliar fairy tale for the first time. I was transported as I read\u2026 at least for the first two hundred pages. The storytelling was mesmerizing, the graceful way it moved forward in time, backward in memory, telling the tale of how Agnieszka came to be taken by the Dragon to his Tower and discover her magic and the magic of the Wood.\u201cThat was the end of the story: no one went into the Wood and came out again, at least not whole and themselves. Sometimes they came out blind and screaming, sometimes they came out twisted and so misshapen they couldn\u2019t be recognized; and worst of all sometimes they came out with their own faces but murder behind them, something gone dreadfully wrong within.\u201dInitially, characterization shone. The young women in this story are human enough to be fallible, but are also caring, determined and faithful. Agnieszka often thinks of herself as a creeping mouse, but she has spirit: \u201cI could sleep at night again, and my spirit began to recover, too. Every day I felt better, and every day more angry.\u201d Lovely, strong Kasia has been Agnieszka\u2019s friend for as long as they can remember, and has been the one everyone knew the Dragon would take: \u201cI know I\u2019m making her sound like something out of a story. But it was the other way around. When my mother told me stories about the spinning princess or the brave goose-girl or the river-maiden, in my head I imagined them all a little like Kasia; that was how I thought of her.\u201d I loved the way Novik noted the tension their roles placed on their relationship while still allowing them to remain fast friends. It was a well-done female friendship, and didn\u2019t go to any of the tropey places I anticipated. The down notes on characterization come later, as Novik pulls a major switch, first garnering sympathy for a weak character and then changing motivations.Plotting kept me guessing. There was a fairy-tale feel to it, but as events started to spiral beyond the initial set-up of self-discovery, I wasn\u2019t able to predict where it would go. Unfortunately, one of the places it did go was a city, and once Agnieska headed there, it transformed from an intimate, personal story to one of epic scale. Agnieska\u2019s personal journey and transformation were sacrificed for politics, losing mystical overtones in favor of mundane ones. It\u2019s hard to put the malevolence of a single courtier on a parallel with a heartwood tree, for instance, and Novik lost the thread of the story. Nieska becomes unbelievably powerful by the time she leaves the city, freely creating spells under stressful situations, magicking escape after escape. Jaga\u2019s book becomes a bit of a deux ex machina, showing her the way to a new spell when she needs it. Characters who behaved a certain way out of deep-seated emotional desires suddenly were realized to be behaving another way out of political intrigue. When an army was brought into it and mobilized within days, I started skimming, depressed I was no longer hanging on to Novik\u2019s every word. It felt like the lovely ride I was on had escaped control.Quite honestly, it reminded me of the way Hollywood tacks on a grand finale action scene to a movie that isn\u2019t really about action\u2013the resulting scenes of the siege seemed over-the-top and actually did make me question Novik\u2019s ideas of character motivations. However, I stuck with it and found that Novik was able to rein in her runaway horse. Once again the Wood was approached and the deep source of the Wood\u2019s discontent discovered. Unfortunately, it made the calculated upheaval in the city and the following siege all the more incongruous.Note should be made of the Dragon\u2019s relationship with Agnieszka. At first, it feels very My Fair Lady, which lots of negative, insulting comments about every aspect of Nieshka\u2019s character. I wasn\u2019t surprised at the growth of emotional connection, and I thought it was handled reasonably organically. Likewise, Nieshka\u2019s growing realization about the long lives of wizards and their growing emotional disconnection made sense. However, I was a little disappointed in how it developed, because it felt like a simple modernization (I\u2019ll spend time on my own without a man! Grow my own life!) of a very old romance trope. The upshot is going to be Nieshka humanizes her calculating, emotionally distant man and will reconnect him to the roots of the world. A five start book might have pushed that conclusion harder.Filled with richer detail than most fairy tales, it reminded me of when I read Beauty: A Retelling of the Story of Beauty and the Beast for the very first time (but you know what was better about the Beast than the Dragon? He was always kind. And he had a library of all the books ever written). I absolutely loved the first section and would have given it all the stars I had to award, but the incongruous battle lost the magic and the hasty ending only had a few moments to regain it. Still, there's something special about such a strong female friendship in a fairy tale."}, {"userName": "Viktoria Winter", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36437228-viktoria-winter", "userReview": "\"Our Dragon doesn't eat the girls he takes, no matter what stories they tell outside our valley.\"\nForget everything you think you know about folklore and enter Novik\u2019s realm of dark fantasy in this stunning debut full of lush and terrifying fiction. Uprooted is easily a unique masterpiece with plots and characters unlike any others in its genre. I started off reading this book as one would begin a thrilling but harrowing task. I\u2019m never one to be put off by the size of a book, however at first glance Uprooted seems like a monstrosity of small fonts and lengthy pages, something that can make any reader feel threatened. Do NOT let this fool you, for once I began to invest my time into the chapters, the pace quickened so much so that I devoured two-hundred pages over the course of a few hours (which for me, and my ADD, was remarkable)! In a strange way, I felt that the book was almost too good for my brain to keep up with everything\u2026if that even makes sense. I like to thoroughly take in every detail of any story, and Novik is a wordsmith goddesses, so of course I was bit overwhelmed by my own sheer exuberance. There\u2019s enough space between her phrases to leave room to the imagination, a feat that I respect when it comes to how an author writes his/her story. But in my case, I was just so excited to read the book that I wound up thinking about reading the book\u2026instead of actually reading the book\u2026(*insert face-palm*). Nevertheless, this piece of fiction is exceptionally crafted and brimming with strong protagonists. This is all I want in an epic fantasy, and I have a feeling you will want it too. \u201cIt comes, I suppose,\u201d I said thoughtfully, speaking to the air, \u201cof spending too much time alone indoors, and forgetting that living things don\u2019t always stay where you put them.\u201d We start off our journey with Agnieszka, a young peasant living in the quant village of Dvernik which borders the deadly, malevolent Wood. Her dearest friend, Kasia, emits strong beauty and bravery\u2015qualities of which the Dragon sees fit enough for a new servant. The Dragon is an immortal wizard who protects the villagers against the dark magic of the Wood, yet each decade he takes the most promising girl to live with and serve him for the next ten years of her life. He des not harm the girls, and each one never returns to their meager lifestyle in the valley once they are put back into the world\u2015instead going off to greater cities pluming wealth and prosperity. Kasia has known since she was a child that she is more than likely to be chosen by the Dragon. Agnieskza has known as well, and the thought of losing her aquatinted-sister is maddening. Until the day of the harvest comes, and the Dragon does not choose Kasia. *It is now three-o\u2019clock in the morning and I just finished Uprooted after binging the book for the previous forty-eight hours. My head is still spinning. That was without a doubt one of the best books I\u2019ve ever read. The plot was enchanting with all its twists and turns, especially considering the abstract idea of the antagonist\u2015and I only say idea because this antagonist was not a person, rather it was a forest more eerie than the one found in Snow White. The Wood, as it is known amongst the characters, is a giant shadow of land that lurks within reach of the village inhabitance, constantly picking off children and others who wander too close. It spreads like disease and can corrupt those who\u2019ve never even been to the outer reaches of the valley, simply by plaguing someone and sending them back without seemingly any traces of evil. Novak has created such a compelling image of darkness, and it is all the more ingenious because this wickedness does not reside within a single person. The antagonist is not governed by what most living antagonists are contrived of\u2015no, this antagonist is literally Mother Nature in full fury. To defeat such a villain, Agnieskza must learn quickly of who she was destined to be, and with the begrudging help of her mentor, the Dragon. The most shocking of all the subplots was undeniably the stories that came from the Wood and it\u2019s origin. You\u2019ll meet characters so wonderfully crafted, and they\u2019ll tear your heart to pieces. This is not your average folktale. It\u2019s so, so much more. But the best thing by far were the characters and the relationships held between each of them. For starters, Agnieszka is not written as some beautiful damsel with a fate that will make or break the becomings of the universe\u2015 she\u2019s simply a peasant girl who cannot go ten minutes without ripping her skirts or getting dirt in her hair. Her bravery, cunningness, compassion, and humorous whit are what makes her character so compelling. I fell in love with her, and that\u2019s not very common for me and the main protagonists because I usually find some flaws that cannot be cast aside to be unnoticed. Raw and so wildly familiar, Agnieszka is all I\u2019ve ever wanted in a strong heroine. What makes her even better is the relationship she shares with her dearest friend, Kasia. I cannot begin to express how pleased I was that Novik didn't touch upon two jealous friends who bicker over boys and beauty. I\u2019m so disgusted with the trope of girls unnecessarily loathing one another, and this book was such an overwhelming breath of fresh air that their sisterly friendship actually did bring me to tears on a few occasions. Also, Kasia wasn\u2019t left behind in the grand scheme of the books commencement. I won\u2019t tell you what becomes of her because that would involve spoilers, but it\u2019s pretty freaking awesome. Kasia is a courageously loyal friend, and a sharp sword when needed be. The Dragon, much like Agnieszka, is not the average brooding male protagonist you might have expected. He\u2019s refined and well-spoken, but also incredibly sarcastic and exasperated with the nonsense he has to put up with. Wizards, especially those who\u2019ve been lingering for more than a century, have grown cold to the ways of endearment. The Dragon cares about the health and safety of his people, and those outside of his borders, but that doesn't mean he wishes to tether himself to them in fear of being hurt through their inevitable deaths. What I love most about him is how he treats everyone else around him, even those who we\u2019d consider enemies. He\u2019s not malicious or hot-headed, in fact he\u2019s quite the opposite. The Dragon (and you will find out his true name int he book!) is very wise and very alone. Agnieszka enters his realm of brick towers and barriers and forces them all down in a heartbreakingly, amusing adventure full of bickering, snipping and name calling. I\u2019m a sucker for platonic friendships, but I\u2019m downright obsessed with those friendships that flourish into platonic romances (which then harvest into something even more beautiful as time goes on). So to surmise, Uprooted, although not heavily focusing on romance of any sort, enraptures all I want in a perfectly imperfect OTP (One True Pairing). This story, although making my heart swell, was nonetheless dark and complicated. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d truly classify this one as YA because there are moments where violence and explicit content are used as the foremost points of development. Perhaps it\u2019s better as a NA novel? Regardless, I wouldn\u2019t mind the rating at all so long as some of these entities don\u2019t disturb you. I\u2019m not quite certain what thrilled me the most; the romance, the battles, or the Wood. Every aspect of this novel was carefully delivered with an underlying tone of bitter darkness that halfway reminded me of tree rot or moss\u2026not that I\u2019m being nostalgic or anything (I totally am). I\u2019ve studied forestry for a while and the organic diction and prose of this story had me swooning. The setting was delightful, and the writing style was one of the best I\u2019ve ever come across. It kept me engaged from prologue to epilogue. But for all the emphasis I put on the world-building and characters, one of the best things about this story was truly the aesthetic of wizardry and witches. I didn't know I\u2019d be reading about witches, specifically ones arranged so whimsically. The spell-language, as the Dragon called it, is lyrical even though my tongue tripped over the strange words more than a few times. The magic is so vividly described that it makes you feel as though you can brew the potions and cast the spells as well. This book presented a look inside the makings of wizards in such a new and darkly romantic angle, and I couldn't have been more pleased. Uprooted is brilliant beyond words, an old artwork that had been lost but newly found and restored to life. It was everything I had hoped it would be and MORE. I\u2019m proud to say that Naomi Novik is now one of my favorite authors and I can\u2019t wait to see what else she\u2019ll gift us in the future. I recommend this book to everyone! It deserves all of the stars, the moon, and the planets. And, like all the books I love madly, I made a playlist for Uprooted which you can listen to HERE. I hope it inspires you to read the book, or if you have read it already then I hope it delights you!

I think in the end I absolutely loved certain elements, but the story as a whole didn't click with me. But hear me out...Let me start with the coolest part: the Wood. The antagonist in this story is a freaking woods and it worked so well. (See, I get started on elements like this and I'm like \"5 STARS! ALL THE STARS!\" But just wait). So people who go into the Wood don't come back, and if they do they're possessed by it: \"they came out with their own faces but murder behind them, something gone dreadfully wrong within.\" Like the people are just a vehicle for the Wood, which has a mind of its own and can plot and is SO WONDERFULLY CREEPY. It's like a mix of The Brothers Grimm movie & Sleepy Hollow:So the basic plot is that the Dragon (who, sadly, is NOT a dragon. He's a centuries-old wizard stuck in an attractive younger body... because this is still YA) lives in a tower and keeps the evil of the Wood at bay. He takes a teen girl from the valley every decade for reasons to do with the Wood & its corruption. The girl just lives in his awesome tower for 10 years, brings the cranky guy food everyday, says a few words to him, and then skedaddles. At the start of the story everyone thinks the Dragon will take Agnieszka's best friend Kaisa, but he takes Agnieszka instead. She finds out she's a super powerful witch, so she learns magic from the Dragon and teaches him too (because she's naturally awesome). Long story short... they save the kingdom? Eh, I really lost interest in the second half.The Dragon's character was one of the biggest letdowns for me. A tormented wizard who broods around his library while casually being the strongest wizard in the land should have a WAY stronger character than what we were left with. All he ever does is belittle Agnieszka and call her an idiot, so I wasn't totally sold on their sudden romance. I wanted to love him so much! But his character fell kind of flat by the end and I wasn't sure why she was so attracted to him. I don't remember him saying one nice thing the entire story. I just wanted a bit more depth to his character in order to connect more with their part of the story. The characters in general kind of took a backseat to the whole plot about the Wood and magic, which was unfortunate because I really liked the characters. The Wood ended up being the strongest part. Agnieszka was a capable MC, but I got a much better sense of her friend Kaisa for some reason. Their friendship was easily the best relationship in the story, though, and I loved how far they'd go to help each other!The beginning of the book was absolutely wonderful. The gorgeous narrative built such a rich world with a dark fairy tale quality. So I was thrilled with everything up until the halfway point where the story suddenly jumped to the capital or wherever. Like the world suddenly got 10x as huge and the plot now revolved around court politics, a ton of new characters, and wars with other kingdoms... and I just did not care. I wanted to go back to the tower with the Dragon or have SOME better segue out of the valley. I really think this book might have worked better for me as a duology with more time spent in each area. It seemed odd to spend so much time out of the valley and set up the politics with other kingdoms only to barely use that in the end. Or to use it weirdly... and I really didn't need that odd backstory for the Wood?I also wasn't huge on the way the lovely slow writing stayed just as slow in giant paragraphs during action scenes so it was hard to tell that anything particularly gripping was happening. I thought the writing was really well done for the most part, though! This was one of the books I've been looking forward to the most this year. In the end I loved this world, but I'm also not sure how much of it I added in my head because of the occasionally vague worldbuilding. I think I liked the story overall? I mean, I didn't actively dislike it and there were a ton of individual aspects that I adored, yet... for some reason I'm kind of ambivalent about the story as a whole. It has everything I would normally love: a creepy fairy tale aesthetic, castles, princes, swords, magic, wizards, libraries, etc. But I really can't forget that I didn't connect with most of the story no matter how hard I tried.I still have mostly positive feelings about this book, though, and do recommend it! Just maybe go into it with lowered expectations? (There are so many 5 star reviews that I was super excited for my new favorite book).
