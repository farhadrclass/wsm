He passed away November 2013 and it\u2019s our great loss. In 2008 Mr. Lane was a Shirley Jackson Award novella finalist for \u201cThe Witnesses Are Gone\u201d. In the introduction to the book Conrad Williams tells us \u201cThis is as honest and as brutal a work of fiction as you are ever likely to read\u201d, and I have to agree with that statement. The horror and dread is so subtly layered into the narrative that the reader becomes totally immersed in this cleaver narrative, when one stops to take a breath, we find no air available to fill our lungs and we don't know where the surface is any longer.The story concerns Martin Swann and his search for an obscure French film maker and his obscure movies. Impending doom sets in from the first few chapters as we learn of Martin\u2019s contemporary life. Rot and slime slowly creep into Martin\u2019s life through accidental discoveries. As he pursues his quest to find more information about the film maker and his bizarre films Martin becomes totally obsessed with the search. Any references he finds to his search warn of impending doom. Martin\u2019s own life becomes such an obsession he enters a drug induced un-reality that rivals the nightmare world he is seeking.This is some great and masterful writing and is recommended to those who read Arthur Machen. Machen on heroine. This hardcover copy of \"The Witnesses are Gone\" is signed by Joel Lane and is one of 500 copies.Artwork for the cover is by Vincent Chong.Introduction by Conrad Williams."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/698826-alan", "userReview": "Joel's latest - he brought it along to the group, looks great.It is excellent. I'm completely biased of course, but Joel has pulled out another creepy, wonderful read full of great images- I like them anyway (eg 'The sea was a grey scroll endlessly being wiped clean and re-written.' or 'Crows flapping overhead like scraps of burnt plastic').A man, Swann, finds videotapes in the shed of his new (old and rundown) house, and discovers fragments of films from a French director Jean Rien (yes Joel likes his puns and bad jokes: at French customs Swann says he has 'rien' to declare, and Rien becomes Juan Nada in Mexico). He tries to track down other films by him but they prove elusive. In doing so he encounters strange men and women, loses his girlfriend, and comes close to some mysterious force, a nihilism that blights all who try to find or worked with Rien.As usual politics are there - on the surface - eg. Swann discusses Bush: 'like the school bully whose father is the local police chief.. he's shaking your hand but when the teacher's back is turned.. [he'll:].. make you kneel before him. Look at the eyes always. Bush has the eyes of a man who likes to hurt.' When he jumps into a freight train carriage he finds refugees who turn away from him.The mystery hits harder I think because Lane roots everything in a gritty realism, the stations and pubs of the English midlands, or the bleak coast of Scotland in winter; and uses real events - the Iraq war and the big London protest against it, for instance. Against this backdrop the weird stuff that happens is very powerful.Superbly done - he draws you down into this shabby, destructive, drug infested and corrupt world by degrees, and you become totally immersed. I've docked one star because he uses the same scene in a gay Paris sex club in his novel The Blue Mask. Tsk, tsk.update: Joel has put me right about this scene - it's different. So I'm making it 5 stars now..another update: Joel told us at the group last week that the book won a Shirley Jackson Novella award (runner up) - he passed round a stone engraved with this information (readers of Jackson's The Lottery will know why a stone..).http://www.shirleyjacksonawards.org/s..."}, {"userName": "Justin Steele", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6171454-justin-steele", "userReview": "Last month I posted a review of Ramsey Campbell's novel The Grin of the Dark. I liked it, but felt that it would have been more effective if it was trimmed to be shorter. Otherwise, the book was an example of a \"man researches lost art (in this case films) and ends up going down a rabbit hole of darkness\" story . Readers of horror will have seen variations on this theme done before, and Campbell used silent film clowns and a world that is perceived to be increasingly hostile to create a book that serves as a great example of this type of story. So far, Theodore Roszak's Flicker seemed to be the only novel that could be called an exemplar of this type of story. It wasn't until a few days ago, when I picked up The Witnesses Are Gone, a novella by Joel Lane, that I can say I found a work that can stand up there with Flicker.Joel Lane knows what he's about. Narrator Martin Swann finds a grainy, disturbing VHS in the shed of his new home. This surreal, black and white film was made by the mysterious French director Jean Rien, who becomes a bit of an obsession of Martin's.The rabbit hole Martin finds himself heading down is dark indeed, and a feeling of despair permeates the novel from start to finish. Lane succeeds at hinting at the terrible without being overt and spoon feeding his readers. This novella manages to be both intelligent, with nods to certain films and literature along with commentary on the United States war with Iraq, and terrifying. The length was perfect, and Lane did not let the story get away from him, but instead managed to keep a tight narrative.Readers of dark literature would do very well to snag this one, and join Martin Swaan in a trip down his sepia-tinted rabbit hole. I couldn't recommend this one enough.Originally appeared on my blog, The Arkham Digest."}, {"userName": "Stephen Theaker", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/937823-stephen-theaker", "userReview": "Martin Swann finds a videotape of an old French film in his new house. He doesn't really enjoy it - it's depressing, miserable and repetitive - but he can't stop thinking about it. When he tries to discover more about the director, Jean Rien, he finds only dead ends. He makes the mistake of persisting.Before saying how wonderful this book was, it's worth saying first that instead of spending hours searching for old magazines, Martin might have had more luck in his quest if he'd begun by looking Jean Rien up on the IMDB...We can guess what would have happened if he had, of course: he'd have got a page loading error, or at best a page of tantalising titles whose links did not work. But it would have been worth mentioning it: you can't help feeling that Martin is ignoring the obvious way to find the answers he needs.Anyway, now that's off my chest: this is a brilliant book. It combines perfectly certain English, American and Japanese traditions of horror, as exemplified by M.R. James, Lovecraft and Hideo Nakata. But this isn't a Frankenstein monster of influences sewn together; somehow Lane makes it seem as if they were all part of the same tradition in the first place.It shares with Lovecraft a moral outrage at the horror: these events are not just horrible or frightening, they are wrong; they should not happen; the world should not allow it. With Nakata it shares an interest in the paradox of film; that it seems more real and substantial than our reality. With James (I think, at least - I confess I've only seen the BBC adaptations) it shares the idea that there are things in the world best ignored for the sake of your own happiness.It's grounded in everyday detail (Martin watches DVDs of Angel with his girlfriend), which makes the strange things that happen even more anomalous. Most of the time Martin's life is normal, mundane. When the supernatural (if that's what it is) intrudes, the reader is knocked off the rails all over again. While the tone is unsettling throughout, two or three sequences are utterly terrifying.Perhaps the book's biggest achievement is that you're left wanting to see the films described, despite the inevitable consequences for your sanity... This was a superb book, one that I read in a single sitting; I refused to let myself sleep until I'd reached the end. And, of course, once I'd reached the end, I couldn't sleep."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1935343-andrew", "userReview": "Martin Swann has amassed little of what would be considered conventional material significance over forty years and therefore is perhaps inevitably drawn towards the seemingly nihilistic movies of director Jean Rien. I say seemingly, because these are movies which go way beyond the usual 'cult' status, being so obscure that they are almost impossible to trace, with the suggestion that Rien's ouvre is somehow limiting and/or deleting itself; frustrating attempts to obtain copies and only appearing on the fringes of reality as blurred stills or in snatches of incomplete reviews. Becoming obssessed with locating these movies, Swann is attempting to find meaning - wishing to fictionalise his experiences, make them a linear concept, drawing coincidences where there are probably none, and seeking to afford himself the status of a character in a story over which he really has no control. Similar to religion - which is also a construct by which mankind believes he has worth - Swann feels compelled to find himself using Rien as a crutch. Ultimately, he fails, because there is nothing there. Not simply nothing substantive: just nothing. And in doing so events disintegrate around him, blur the boundaries of film and reality, until he loses everything (sometimes willingly), with the final realisation that our perception of all life - like film - only has a worth if we give it one.This is a finely written and intense novella and comes highly recommended."}, {"userName": "John Wiske", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6502796-john-wiske", "userReview": "Few reviews refer to the anonymously (nemonymously) published short story that spawned Joel Lane's own The Witnesses Are Gone. I find that curiously apropos in a metafictional sort of way, as the shared premise of both stories is of works that defy attempts at serial contextualization by alternately vanishing themselves from the physical world and then from memory. Again appropriately, finding \"The Vanishing Life and Films of Emmanuel Escobada\" is challenging but possible... and happily, as yet, is not as catastrophic to the seeker as the finding of the films by these fictional (?) directors appears to be.Joel Lane writes beautiful, ghostly, devastating sentences. A common thread through his work is of people desperate to find reason amid the chaos of reality. And, tragically, the harder one tries to understand, the more one consequently unravels the veil of order. It is, effectively, psychological suicide. It's why, I imagine, Lane is frequently linked to Lovecraft and Ligotti, in spite of profound mythological and stylistic differences.The Witnesses Are Gone is a nearly perfect novella: a story with room to breathe without becoming bloated. As others have noted, Lane achieves something magical in his descriptions of the films uncovered during the course of the story. The pacing on these scenes of description is perfect. Lane composes serial snapshots that propel the viewer/reader forward without feeling disjointed. On the contrary, one feels dangerously and seductively immersed. Likewise, Lane's exploration of people and places are at once razor sharp and hallucinogenically misty, capturing that horrible hyperreality that hides behind the illusion of order. My sole criticism would be in the author's/narrator's brief political asides. They aren't entirely out of place conceptually, speaking to the whimsical cruelty of the modern political and social landscape. But too frequently their introduction feels abrupt and tangential. That said, to forgo this novella for such a minor flaw would be to deprive oneself of a powerful literary voice that was silenced far too soon."}, {"userName": "G.R. Yeates", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4029286-g-r-yeates", "userReview": "I was initially wary of this novella as the search for a lost film of supernatural significance has been tackled a number of times in the horror; one of the most powerful examples I can think of being Ramsey Campbell's Ancient Images. However, this novella completely floored me. The narrative follows Martin Swann who becomes obsessed with finding the remaining films of Jean Rien after he views one on an old video cassette. It starts off bleak and melancholy and this mood permeats every page throughout. This is a very British work as you can almost feel the depressing drizzle that falls from the eponymous overcast skies onto Swann's head as he follows a trail that you know is leading him to nothing good. That might read like a spoiler but, trust me, it's not. Nothingness and absence is a key theme to this novella as it contrasts its traditional plot tropes where something cosmic and terrible is waiting to be discovered with the real world horrors of the second Iraq war and the callous indifference of Network Rail to the crashes at Potter's Bar and Hatfield. The sense of creeping decay and disintegration accrues at a perfect pace throughout. If I was to compare this to another horror work, it would Thomas Ligotti's 'The Bungalow House' as the desolate films of Jean Rien and Swann's obsession with seeing more reminded me of the Bungalow House tapes and the narrator's urgent desire to listen to more and meet the creator. As in 'The Bungalow House', when Swann comes face to face with the creator it is not what you expect at all."}, {"userName": "Tom Loock", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6016861-tom-loock", "userReview": "The Witnesses Are Gone was the first book I read by Joel Lane and based on this novella alone, it was also the last. No doubt, he is a competent writer and the descriptions of the greater Birmingham area and of Paris at night are very good, and from my own experience very accurate. I just don't enjoy reading stories of miserable people who become even more miserable and paranoid.

Swann experiences an unnamed terror, a terrible unease, while overseas another kind of terror escalates as the US wages war against Iraq. Loved this.
