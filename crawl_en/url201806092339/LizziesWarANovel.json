Taking place between July 1967 and Labor Day 1968, the novel is reflective of the period. At home, riots are burning the country and in Vietnam, men are dying at an alarming rate in an unpopular war in an unforgiving country.Captain Michael O\u2019Reilly, USMC, has shipped out for Da Nang. His wife, Liz, is on her way to her parents with their four kids in tow. Danny is ten, Kathie is eight, Angus is seven, and Deb-Deb is five. Reluctantly, child number five is on the way, much to Liz\u2019s chagrin. She had hopes to go back into the theatre, but that dream seems impossible. Still, like a good Catholic wife and mother, Liz plans to learn to love the child she is carrying. Farrington weaves a tale that resembles cramming together Jan Struther\u2019s Mrs. Miniver (yes, it was a book before it was a movie) and Tim O\u2019Brien\u2019s The Things They Carried. It alternates betweens Mike\u2019s war stories and Liz\u2019s efforts on the homefront. Besides their love for each other and the kids, Liz and Mike are joined in their grief over the death of a friend on the Vietnam battlefield. Liz does her best to comfort her newly-widowed friend, while Mike does all he can not to wind up like Larry. This is not a neat and tidy story. Mike is severely wounded while a third trimester miscarriage almost kills Liz. Still it is a story of sacrifice and endurance. Simply un-put-downable."}, {"userName": "Scottsdale Public Library", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4332892-scottsdale-public-library", "userReview": "Refreshingly honest and shockingly perceptive as to the insights of some of the emotions that surround a deployment.

The most literal battles in it are waged by a seasoned officer in various harrowing scenarios in Vietnam, but there are also the spiritual battles of a Catholic priest with his calling, his own war history, and his attraction to a lonely parishioner. Most centrally, though, it's about the battle of tough-minded Lizzie to keep herself, her children, and other families around her from falling apart while their husbands are deployed, and sometimes even after they return. Woven through all this, the battle for civil rights also provides the threat of explosions closer to home.So there's a lot going on, and that's not even touching on the extent to which this book is a love song to Marine families. Farrington might be at his most touching when writing about children whose fathers are overseas. As the priest remarks in hilarious deadpan during one of the kids' potato gun offensives, \"War is hell,\" but these characters -- even the kids -- often discover their own moral bottom lines in the course of battle.There's a lot to chew on here, much of it defying stereotype. Tim Farrington is also one of my favorite prose stylists ever (and, fair disclosure, has become a friend). Despite the gritty subject matter (especially compared to THE MONK DOWNSTAIRS, which I adore), I found this book a real pleasure to read."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12565064-emily", "userReview": "This book is what real feels like.

While it was well written I remember the Vietnam era and the war and protests everywhere. Mike O'Reilly, a captain in the marines is deployed to Khe Sahn in Vietnam in 1967 while his wife Lizzie is left at home with four young children to deal with. Lizzie's story shows the fear, loneliness and anger that she has to confront. Mike's story tells us of the tedium as well as horror of that war and probably all wars. Mike believes in the objective of the war. He believes in his duty to serve. Therefore even when he's seriously wounded he refuses to go home and he reruns to the battlefield.Remembering that time well, I had a hard time understanding Mike's devotion to the war effort. Everyone I knew was opposed to the war. This book barely scrapes the surface of the anti-war movement. I wish there was more of it in the book. It would have made for a more interesting read."}, {"userName": "Sharon Griffin", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29112384-sharon-griffin", "userReview": "This book began with a somewhat shallow or flip tone about Vietnam War and the family whose lives were affected by it.

Set in 1967-68, the narrative centers on the title character, who raises her 4 kids while her husband is in Viet Nam, struggles with an unplanned pregnancy, and thinks about what it means to be married to someone so far away and the person she was before marriage and kids. Mike, her husband, fights in Viet Nam, while leading and trying to protect his men in a chaotic environment. A third character, the associate pastor at Lizzie\u2019s church, Father Germaine, himself a war veteran, fights his own demons\u2014a crisis of faith and a battle with alcoholism.The story is well told, providing alternating perspectives, as sections of each chapter narrate episodes from either Lizzie\u2019s or Mike\u2019s life (occasionally, the narrative takes the form of letters Mike writes to Lizzie). Mike\u2019s war is straightforward: he is fighting in Viet Nam\u2014primarily at Khe Shan\u2014trying to keep both himself and his men alive. But as the title suggests, Lizzie\u2019s war takes center stage: she strives to be the ideal 1960s mother but perpetually feels she falls short; she alternates between absolute anxiety over Mike\u2019s safety and fierce anger that he volunteered to go to Viet Nam; and she grapples with issues of identity as she considers both who she is as a wife and mother as well as who she might be outside of those roles. Father Germaine plays a secondary role to Mike and Lizzie (and I have to say\u2014I do wish he were in the story a bit more), but he becomes important to Lizzie and her oldest son. Germaine\u2019s struggles complement and sometimes mirror those of the central couple.This aspect of Lizzie\u2019s War, where the narrative of a character complements that of another is one that I found quite effective. Farrington connects the characters together through parallel events, and this is especially so in the case of Lizzie and Mike. I like the idea that even though this married couple is separated by so much physical and mental space, their lives are still linked together.What I liked most about Lizzie\u2019s War, though, is its engagement with issues of faith. When I first started reading, I was worried that the novel would present religious ideas and faith in a Polyanna-ish manner, but that is the opposite of Farrington\u2019s novel. What has always appealed to me about Catholicism (at least since I\u2019ve been old enough to think about such things) is its ability to provide\u2014not a set of dos and don\u2019ts upon which to judge oneself\u2014but solace and comfort. The characters\u2014especially Lizzie and Germaine\u2014show the value of faith for flawed, imperfect people in a fallen, messy world."}, {"userName": "Kandi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20911683-kandi", "userReview": "Upon finishing this novel, my heart is filled with respect for our men and women who leave to fight our senseless wars and also their families, for their sacrifice. Much like the character of Lizzie in this story, I'm against any foreign policy that sends our loved ones off to fight, but I still support our brave soldiers who feel it's their duty to protect, serve and die for our Country. They are all amazing and I want them to know that we here at home respect and appreciate all that they do. I chose to read this book since I lived thru this bleak time period during the Vietnam War. I had friends and family fighting in Vietnam - I lost quite a few of them. I also had a good friend of mine marry a Marine because of an unplanned pregnancy. Days after their \"shotgun\" wedding, her new husband shipped out for Vietnam. My friend ended up dropping out of High School before she graduated because her pregnancy was so rough - she was 16 or 17 at the time. I did my best to support her and keep her spirits up during her husband's deployment and her pregnancy here at home. Ultimately, her husband was killed while serving, leaving her a single parent with no HS diploma. What rough times we had back then - my heart aches for the families and the men and women serving now in the Middle East.I'll be interested in how this author handles this story since I have first-hand knowledge of real families and friends who struggled to get thru these dark times. A novel about this subject is still very relevant now in the year 2016 and it saddens me that our politician's keep repeating history when they should know better. It's sad and heartbreaking for many of our citizens who are affected by their bad choices."}, {"userName": "Timothy Bazzett", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5491319-timothy-bazzett", "userReview": "I read Lizzie's War a few years back now and thought I'd reviewed it then, but I guess I didn't. It is perhaps one of the few novels about the Vietnam War that shows both sides of a marriage affected by the war. Lizzie was the wife of a Marine officer deployed to Vietnam and the narrative has a kind of variable viewpoint. First you see what the husband is doing and enduring and then what the wife is doing and enduring. Their letters play a big role too, but not because of what they say, but rather what they don't say. You'll also see how the war and the split family affects the children. I can't remember for sure now, but I think there were four or five kids and Mom Lizzie was pregnant again. And oh yeah, they were Catholics, so her faith was being sorely tested with this pregnancy, which she was facing alone for the most part. She sought advice from the local priest who was quite taken with Lizzie. It gets a bit complicated in that area actually. Farrington's dad was a Marine in Vietnam, and he based much of his novel on stories he'd heard growing up from his father's marine friends. If there is an autobiographical element here it probably would lie in the portrayal of the 12-13 year-old son, an altar boy who tries his best to be \"the man of the family\" while wrestling with all the normal pangs of sexual awakening and growing up. Suffice it to say that this is a very moving and eloquently told story of how military families all face their own kinds of personal hell, whether in combat or on the homefront. If you like a good story, then I guarantee you'll like Lizzie's War."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7286472-karen", "userReview": "[ especially the relationship between Liz & Fr.

He seemed to disappear at the end, as though he didn't exist in the first place. And also more details on the relationship between Mike and Liz when he'd returned. I know they ask each other whether they'll survive, but I think I wanted closure for Liz to tell Mike how her own wars were fought alone.

It is a coming of age story, a family story and a story about how the person we are closest to can sometimes be literally and spiritually the farthest from what we think. Lizzie's War faces huge and ironic conundrums that are real in every family - even if they played out differently in the house we grew up in.

I liked this new book, just not quite as much as his other. \"Lizzie's War\" is the story of Lizzie and Michael O'Reilly and takes place in 1968-69, during the Viet Nam War. He is a Marine officer who is in VN and she is at home in VA with three children, expecting a fourth. The story alternates between her life and his, and is an interesting juxtaposition. I think that Farrington does outstanding character development and did a great job of describing a family that truly is living on the edge.

I liked how the point of view would alternate between the battles in Vietnam and those at home. Many of the emotions described in the book are very real and applicable to any wife who put her dreams on hold and had to send her husband off to fight a war. Being a Marine Corps wife made much of the vernacular easier to understand, and appreciate. Mr. Farrington did a good job researching his story and making it believable. My only suggestion to fellow military spouses is to read this book after he's home from deployment, not during, it puts in black and white many of the feelings and fears associated with deployments and not all spouses will make it through this story dry-eyed. 3.5 stars mostly because it read too quickly and could've gone deeper into some of Lizzie's relationships with the other characters."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5631751-cathy", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this book. I liked the way the author told the story of this family, dad off in Vietnam and mom working to hold it together at home. I think the author's message was to capture the incredible difficulty of \"keeping the home fires burning\" (I can't imagine). He also tries to give you a peek into the mind of a duty bound soldier (agree or not). There are some very funny passages in this book, especially Mike's battlefield sarcasm in the face of horrific conditions. Alternatively, there are developments and side stories that pack an emotional punch. The relationship between Lizzie and father Germaine was delicate, tender and cathartic to them both.
