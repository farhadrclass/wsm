Obviously this wasn\u2019t the case for Olaf Olafsson. He decided to save time and energy by simply shoplifting wholesale the fabulous memoirs of Iris Origo. He steals her house and her wartime experiences to give his novel its structure and heart and then, to add insult to injury, invents an adultery on her part to commercially liven things up. I suppose if you have no knowledge of War in Val d'Orcia: An Italian War Diary, 1943-1944 you might find merit and enjoyment in this aspect of the novel. But it\u2019s what Olafsson adds to his pilfering that made this a clumsy and rather pointless novel for me. Welded onto Origo\u2019s memoirs with little artistry is a story about a forged painting. An art student with little training is suddenly and wholly implausibly restoring old master paintings. And not only can she restore old master paintings she can also forge a Caravaggio \u2013 a Caravaggio that has no existence but is accepted without a shred of suspicion by everyone in the art world as authentic. This painting is supposed to supply the mystery and heartbeat to the novel but I\u2019m afraid I never once believed in it. Also the aesthetic correlation between the painting and the Origo narrative was forced and uneasy, like a broken vase glued back together by a guilty child. Maybe he thought he was being clever by forging someone\u2019s memoirs in a novel about a forged painting? I was simply left wondering why, if a novelist can\u2019t invent his own world, is he writing novels at all? If I were related to iris origo I\u2019d probably think about suing.  But do read the original - War in Val d'Orcia: An Italian War Diary, 1943-1944"}, {"userName": "Cynthia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1802440-cynthia", "userReview": "The first and last chapters of \u201cRestoration\u201d are absolute gems with Olafsson\u2019s painterly descriptions of Italian countryside and his portrayals of human anguish. The first chapter lures you into the story, the last chapter satisfies. This is not to say the story lags in between. It doesn\u2019t but there is a dreamlike cadence to how things unfold, for instance one of the main characters isn\u2019t named until about a third of the way through the book. Other characters are only glimpsed through memories. Olafsson is wonderful at conveying a sense of Italy\u2019s beauty and its social life right before and during World War II.Kristin is the other main character. She is a young Icelandic woman with an art background who works in Rome with an expatriate Brit restoring old master paintings. Interpersonal secrets abound as everyone dreads or complicatedly hopes for the Germans and the Allies to get closer. Throughout the story everything and everyone is at least slightly broken. Olafsson does a great job of showing the impact of war and especially the price of this particular war. People go on having their personal battles but with another layer added of trying to survive and keep their loved ones safe. The only disappointment I had with \u201cRestoration\u201d (and I understand this is not fair) is that I was hoping for a more in depth discussions of art techniques and history."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "Now this is a great summer read. Not only is it beautiful to hold (Ecco imprint, thick deckled pages, only 336 pages in a 5-5/15 x 8 inch format), but the words just made me want to slow down and savor. The characters in this book were making their dreams come alive: a wealthy woman uses her ample funds to get her hands dirty restoring an old villa on a wind-swept mountain in Tuscany, and a penniless, parentless artist finds her calling restoring the paintings of old masters in Rome. Cochineal, indigo, white lead, cinnabar, umber, ocher, kermes and weld: the words bring their own smell, their own color. Add Rome, Tuscany, love, passion, wealth and youthful beauty in the pre-war years and the combination is irresistible. That the dreams of both women are blasted apart by World War II and their relationships with men adds depth to the drama, and it continues very near to present day, when the artist looks back and has us question again the nature of great art. Provenance in terms of art, it turns out, is almost all its value.According to David Leavitt, writing a review for the New York Times earlier this year, the provenance of Olafsson\u2019s story is deeply rooted in the real-life adventures of Iris Origo, about which she wrote in a nonfiction memoir called War in Val d\u2019Orcia. Leavitt sounds a little incensed in his review that Olafsson did not emphasize this \u201cborrowing\u201d and writes  In 1993, I was sued by the poet Stephen Spender after I wrote a novel, \u201cWhile England Sleeps,\u201d based on an episode from his memoir \u201cWorld Within World.\u201d If I learned anything from that unhappy experience, it was that it\u2019s essential for writers to acknowledge their sources fully and without hedging.That\u2019s fine with me. For writers, painters, innovators, anybody who borrows from another: Acknowledge the source and keep the provenance clear, but\u2026art historians and wordsmiths don\u2019t kill me\u2026I believe great art can be created borrowing techniques, styles, and yes, the stories, of others and it doesn\u2019t diminish the work in any way. And that is really the central question of the book\u2014you\u2019ll see when you read it.So yes, this is a fine book when you don\u2019t want a massive tome and just want beautiful words arranged artfully on the page."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3739451-suzanne", "userReview": "This is a story about love, betrayal, loss and forgiveness. The main character, Alice, is a British ex-pat who grew up in Florence, and married Claudio, a titled Italian, albeit a poor one. Together they rescue a farm in Tuscany and raise their young son there. As World War II engulfs Italy, Alice begins a foolish affair and was busy seeing to her own needs when her young son falls ill and dies. Despairing, she believes she is being punished for her misdeeds, but still longs to reconcile with her husband, who disappears before she can do so.I received an advance review copy of this book from the publisher. I am free to say exactly what I think, and I am not required to write a good review. That said, this book is so good, I can\u2019t say enough positive things about it! For starters, Olafsson chooses subjects that I really enjoy. Tuscany, Europe during World War II, and Nazi art theft. What could be more intriguing? Then, he presents two amazing stories that intertwine and connect so adeptly. I loved how the author presents the main character as a narrator, as if she is speaking to her missing husband. The author uses wonderful imagery to place the reader in Tuscany and yet, as you\u2019re relishing the place you have found yourself in, you are left disturbed and unsettled as the war encroaches upon you.The only thing I would change about this book is the title. While Restoration refers to a painting, the word itself has multiple meanings, and so might deter someone from picking up this book. Also, when I tried to search for the book on Goodreads, there were so many other books that came up with this name, that it took quite a while to find it. I would be too bad if this book were overlooked because of the title. It\u2019s definitely one worth reading!"}, {"userName": "Susan (aka Just My Op)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2489613-susan-aka-just-my-op", "userReview": "A mysterious painting, war-torn Italy, orphans, ex-pats, traitors, death of a beloved, hints of romance \u2013 this novel has all the earmarkings of a terrific story. And I did enjoy reading it. Having said that, it fell a little flat for me. If it was trying to be a mystery, there was not enough mystery. For a war story, there was not enough about the war. Ditto for the romance. As literary fiction, it just didn't shine as it could have. For my tastes, the book was going in too many directions at once, and not entirely successful at any one of them. Quite a bit was told as a woman writing in her diary, and while that can work very well for some authors, there was too much telling in this book. All of that together makes for a 3-star rating from me. While I did enjoy reading it, there was nothing to make it memorable.

The setting for this novel is an Italian villa that's been restored - unfortunately, it soon finds itself on the front lines of WWII as the Germans retreat into the steep valley surrounding it, with the Allies right on their heels. Complicating the picture, so to speak, is a meticulously \"restored\" masterpiece by Caravaggio that becomes a bargaining chip between the two main characters: an Icelandic girl and the English woman who has taken her in along with many refugees, including wounded partisans and orphaned children.. Both women are at the mercy of an American art dealer in Rome, who's not above selling priceless artworks to the Nazis. The story revolves around themes of love and betrayal. But it's the way the beautiful, fertile, Italian landscape enfolds the characters and holds the reader spellbound that makes this novel so memorable. The author's distancing technique works well in that sense, but there's a cold detachment to the narrative (even in the private-journal sections) that sometimes makes it hard to feel as sympathetic towards the main characters as you'd expect. Altogether, though, it's a very riveting story."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "With a title like RESTORATION, it\u2019s no surprise that at the center of the story, there is a restoration\u2026in this case, a forgery of an esteemed Caravaggio painting by a young talented artist named Kristin who is spurned in love by her master. That master restorer, Marshall, a man of dubious ethics, says: \u201cNo canvas lasts more than two centuries. If left alone, they all turn into dust. Those who think that art restoration is simply dusting and cleaning exhibit incredible naivete. Interpreters, Kristin. That\u2019s what we are.\u201dSo the stage is set: restoration is interpretation. Which brings me to the second and presumably more important thread of the story: a tale of Alice, a wealthy British ex-pat who moves with her new Italian husband to a villa in Tuscany that also needs massive restoration. Alice, according to the epilogue, is based on Iris Origo, a real-life Marchesa of Val d\u2019Orcia, who kept diaries during the war years (the book is set in the early 1940s.)The lives of these two remarkable women intersect in an unexpected way, keeping them in close contact during the encroaching fighting of Germans and Allied troops. Each has taken on a massive project -- the painting and the villa \u2013 and interpreted it in ways that suit her unique needs. And Olaf Olaffson himself surely must be aware that he, too, is the interpreter of the real-life diaries, bringing Marchesa Origo\u2019s fictional conterpart to life.All this begs the question: does it work? For the most part, it does. This is a plot-driven story, albeit one that requires close attention at the beginning because of constant jumps back and forth in time and hints of future action. Mr. Olaffson, like a fine painter, creates beautiful brushstrokes that bring Tuscany of the war years to life and recreate the sounds, sights, and scents.From this reader\u2019s perspective, the Kristin thread was far more compelling than the Alice thread; I suspect it wasn\u2019t meant to be that way. Kristin\u2019s story is written in the third-person and offers up suspense and raw emotions. Alice\u2019s story, written in the more immediate first-person, is more detached. I never fully \u201cfelt\u201d the love conflicts that she experienced and the push-pull of her marriage with Claudio seemed bland. Still, I kept turning pages, rapt in the story, and I wouldn\u2019t have considered for a moment putting down the book before finding out how it ended."}, {"userName": "Virginia Campbell", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2333268-virginia-campbell", "userReview": "It has been a while since I have read a book where the overall story was the star, and the characters were necessary components to reach the final page. I enjoyed \"Restoration\", by Olaf Olafsson, very much. The human failings and strengths of each character add shaded complexities to the horrific World War II story line. The contrast of the settings of glorious Tuscany and the destruction from bombing, killing and marauding invaders is piercing. There is no hero or heroine in this story, but a collection of people and lives that you hope will somehow be set to rights. There are secrets, betrayals, devastating loss, and mysteries which propel the characters toward resolutions and new beginnings. Alice is the wealthy daughter of a class-conscious British family. She shocks everyone by marrying Claudio, an entitled minor-landowner, and moving with him to Tuscany. They begin their life together in a once-beautiful villa in need of much repair. As they work side by side to build a dream life, they try to ignore their underlying differences. A much-loved son, Giovanni, is born, and they find a measure of contentment. However, as the villa and its lands begin to flourish, more and more demands are made upon both Claudio and Alice. He is very much a man of the land and his dependents, and she begins to long for tastes of the life she left behind. She recklessly reaches out for greater fulfillment, and yet she is not without guilt and self-recrimination. The illness and eventual death of young Giovanni pushes Claudio and Alice further apart. Her intended reparation to their marriage is halted by Claudio's strange disappearance. Alice is left to manage the villa and its lands with the help of a devoted family friend, Pritchett. As the war progresses, more and more seekers of sanctuary descend upon Alice and her home. One of them, a young woman named Kristin, comes bearing a serious wound and deep secrets which could gravely affect many in their wake. The effects of our actions and missteps are very much evident here, and those with survivor guilt must find a way to move forward. Chose to live, and live the life you are given. This is a book which will make you want to read it all in one setting. You will want to know how the final pieces of the puzzle fall into place. A very good read.

Although talented, she is trusting to a fault.Kristin and Alice\u2019s lives intersect against the backdrop of war-torn Italy in 1944 and the mystique of the Tuscany region. For these women sexual dalliances have dire consequences. Paintings are not the only thing being restored in this novel. Fallible human beings seek redemption. The author spins out his story by examining the remorseful self-examinations of both female characters. The frequently changing points of view reflect the unsettled lives of the characters. The technique is interesting and original, but it slows the pace of the plot. Readers willing to use their imagination and draw their own conclusions will reap rewards by the end of the novel. Olafsson is a writer who makes his readers think rather than feeding his tale to them on a silver platter. The writer of the book jacket synopsis took the opposite approach\u2014telling us more than we\u2019d like to know upfront.Lovers of literary fiction who appreciate the craft of writing will enjoy this book.

Set in Tuscany during the waning days of World War II, the title has several meanings - the restoration of the villa and farms at San Martino, the restoration work Kristin does on paintings, the restoration of peace, and possibly the restoration of Alice's life to something closer to normal.The pacing is rather slow, with the tension coming from the war and from Alice's relationship with her husband, their friend Pritchett and her lover. Kristin's life in Iceland and Italy also plays into this as her employer/lover, Marshall, is selling art to the Germans, including a \"Caravaggio\" she \"repaired\". Overall there's little surprise here, and I didn't feel as though this was really an Italian novel but rather set there by happenstance. The parts about painting restoration and techniques were interesting, and had there been more of that or more of Alice's relationship with her husband and dead son, I would have found the book more compelling.Copy provided by publisher."}, {"userName": "Valentina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4197862-valentina", "userReview": "This book took me by surprise. I really did not expect something so deep and moving, something so well written. I\u2019d actually been reluctant to pick it up, because I thought it would be one of those books focused solely on World War II, but I\u2019m so glad I did end up giving it a chance.There are two interconnecting plot lines: Kristin\u2019s and Alice\u2019s. The book goes back and forth in time (think The English Patient, not Time Traveler\u2019s Wife) in such a masterful way that the reader is never confused. On the contrary, it\u2019s hard to put the book down once you get past the first chapter. The war is always second stage to the relationships in the book, whether husband between a husband and wife or between two lovers. This is a collection of relationships.The writing is superb, stark and powerful. Once in a while the dialogue felt a bit stilted, but not enough to frustrate the reader. The way it ends, which I will not reveal, of course, is perfect, tucking in all the loose ends and leaving the reader with a sense of peace.This is a book I highly recommend to lovers of literary fiction.

This is a beautifully written book, but I didn\u2019t need subplots about Nazis hiding stolen art or multiple unfaithful marriages. I also didn\u2019t need two interlocking stories written in first and third person (sometimes about the same person) that seemed to muddy the plot with too many coincidences.Historical fiction often involves imagining scenes that may not have really happened, and giving historical people characteristics they may not have had. Historical fiction is one of my favorite genres to read and write. That said, I was not impressed to discover that Olafsson basically copied real life author Iris Origo\u2019s already-published accounts of the Tuscan farm\u2019s role in World War II.He is such a talented writer, I would prefer to read characters and plot that come all from his imagination."}, {"userName": "Kevin McAllister", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/233482-kevin-mcallister", "userReview": "Restoration is a novel of two women both being haunted by mistakes from their pasts, brought together by circumstances to a villa in Tuscany, which eventually turns into the frontline in a battle between the retreating Germans and The Allied forces during World War Two.

Alice, een meisje uit een gefortuneerd Brits gezin en woonachtig in Florence, trouwt zeer tegen de zin van haar ouders met Claudio. Samen met deze zoon van een eenvoudige boer verhuist ze naar San Martino. Daar betrekken ze een vervallen villa die ze door hard werken weten om te bouwen tot een paradijs. Ze krijgen samen een zoon en lijken gelukkig. Alice krijgt echter steeds meer heimwee naar het leven zoals ze dat leidde voordat ze trouwde met Claudio. Ze vlucht daarom regelmatig terug naar haar ouders en krijgt in Florence een affaire met een jeugdliefde. Deze vlucht krijgt op een gegeven moment een dramatische consequentie, waarvan ze de rest van haar leven het verdriet zal voelen. Tijdens de Tweede Wereldoorlog zoeken veel mensen en kinderen onderdak bij de villa in San Martino. Een van die mensen is Kristin, die om een heel andere reden de villa bezoekt.

Marshall lures the love-struck Kristin into an illicit affair, using her devotion to him to satisfy his sexual pleasure while he exploits her considerable artistic talent in the restoration of damaged old masters.By threatening to expose her long kept secret, he blackmails the guilt ridden Alice into assisting him in aiding the Germans in their plan to remove art from Italy, a dangerous game that could cost her not only her life but the lives of those she loves and the home she has worked so hard to preserve.The author's choice title for this narrative is more than apt since this is a tale of the restoration of a multitude of things beginning with a villa purchased by two newlyweds, to artistic masterpieces restored to their original beauty, to a land and a people ravaged by war, and culminating with the reaffirmation and renewal of a woman's' dignity and the recognition of her talent following a series of infidelities and betrayals.While the flow of the story is a bit choppy at times, jumping from one persons perspective to another, the authenticity of it's historical setting and the authors disclosure that his work, although fiction, is based upon the real life of Marchesa Alice Orsini, are elements that sre sure to provide a satisfying read to lovers of the historical fiction, art history or romance genres."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3771119-julie", "userReview": "Among the steep hills of Italy, a remote villa and its inhabitants experience the encroaching war as Germans retreat and Allies advance upon their idyllic rural life. Alice, the mistress of the villa, is harboring a secret while tending to refugee children and supervising the wellbeing of her tenants in her husband\u2019s absence. Kristin, a gifted artist and restoration specialist, has made her way to the estate in pursuit of Alice\u2019s secret. Their two stories collide in a narrative filled with regret and violence as their lives are torn apart by war.There were so many good aspects to this novel: the history of Germans acquiring artwork during WWII, the process of painting restoration, and farm life in the Tuscan countryside, among others. Often, though, the constant shifting of perspective was abrupt, which sometimes felt too demanding. One moment it is Alice in the first person as she is writing to her absent husband in her journal. The next it is either a third person account of Kristin\u2019s past or just as suddenly what she is doing in the present narrative. Aside from this stylistic technicality, I enjoyed the way Olafsson gradually let his readers in on to the major events that led each woman to her current situation. The idea of restoration applies to more than just paintings, and the theme is played out well throughout the book.I received a complimentary copy of this book via the Amazon Vine program."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30916346-diane", "userReview": "I was pretty disappointed with this novel. It sounded interesting - Alice, an Englishwoman, marries the son of an Italian landowner, and begins restoring a Tuscan villa. During World War II, Alice grows restless and has a relationship that opens her up to blackmail from an unscrupulous art dealer named Robert Marshall. He forces her to hide a priceless painting by Caravaggio, in her villa. Meanwhile, Alice opens her home to refugees, orphans, and wounded allied soldiers. To complicate matters further, Marshall's lover Kristin, an artist with the gift to restore any painting, also shows up, seriously wounded after the train she was traveling on was bombed. Like I said, it sounded interesting, but it wasn't. I got bored. I hate forcing myself to finish a book, but that is what I did here. The characters never came alive to me. The point of view changes from chapter to chapter, which would not be so bad, but Olafsson doesn't always indicate whose point of view it is. It can take several pages to figure out whether it's Alice or Kristin. I also hate it when writers use present tense. I find it extremely annoying. However, only part of the book is in present tense. Suddenly, on page 115, everything is in past tense, only to switch to present tense again later on. By that time, I really didn't care any longer. Looking at the reviewer's blurb on the back cover, I wonder if we read the same book. I'm glad this was a bargain book."}, {"userName": "Susan Johnson", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5172713-susan-johnson", "userReview": "This novel literally took my breath away in its luminosity and elegant writing. This is the story of two women, Alice and Kristin, who lead very different lives but cross paths at several important times. They are not friends but their fates cross and the story alternates between the two women.Alice grew up in a circle of British ex-pats in Florence in the 1920's. She fell in love with a titled man and they run off together to start a new life. They discover a rundown estate of 3500 acres in the province of Siena and labor for years turning it into a beautiful, working home. Kristin is an Icelander who comes to Rome through Copenhagen. She is an artist that meets an art expert and carves out a career in art restoration.Their journey is about making peace with decisions they have made especially romantically. As they struggle with the results of those decisions, World War II is being fought all around them. They must cope with German occupation and then their retreat but the story really isn't about the war. It's about so much more than that.I am doing a lousy job in telling you just how wonderful this book is. It is absolutely the best book I've read in a long time. I put it on that special book shelf that has \"The Help\" and \"Major Pettigrew\" on it. Books that stay with you. Books that make you a better person. Books that matter. Books that are the reason I read.I cannot recommend this book highly enough. It's simply wonderful."}, {"userName": "Almira", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1103497-almira", "userReview": "Well, it's been more than a few days.Time frame spans from 1920's to 1940's.Alice Orsini leaves the exclusive circle of British ex-pats, marries the son of an Italian, minor landowner and takes on the task of restoring the crumblin villa - San Martino. Robert Marshall is a renowned dealer of Renaissance art and has known Alice, and her indiscretion.

These two women must join forces to prevent the destruction of many of the World's great masterpieces.In reading this, Olaf goes into much detail about the process of art restoration, and in reading about the process, I wondered \"when a masterpiece by one of the greats, needs to be restored, does that masterpiece still \"belong\" to the original artist or does the restorer's work take over the piece of art\"?, especially when a major portion of the work needs restoration... When I posed that question to my husband, even he had to stop and reflect on that.

Mislim da je pisac mnogo radio na svo\u0111enju teksta pa ovaj kompleksno gra\u0111eni roman ima relativno kratka poglavlja tako da ponekad sti\u010dete utisak da je svaka re\u010denica potrebna, neoboriva u narativnoj celini.

It provided an intense moment, showed the characters' personalities well, and promised much. Then it collapsed. The narrative switched into second person, which is technically very difficult to maintain. The narrative also became much less compelling. The character's backstory wasn't compelling, and the writing wasn't strong enough to make up for it. It became confusing due to the number of people mentioned; without any direction from the author on where to focus, the novel began to feel like too much work to follow. I stopped reading before page 30. I do think that for a certain kind of reader, one interested in this historic timeframe (which I am) and who also likes a bit of soap-opera kind of drama (which I don't), this work could be a great read, so do give it a try.If you enjoy multiple perspectives in your story, you might enjoy Reparation: A Novel of Love, Devotion and Danger."}, {"userName": "Vivian Valvano", "userReviewDate": "May 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2765915-vivian-valvano", "userReview": "I am so glad that my friend Rosanne recommended this novel to me. Its focus is late-World War II Italy, but there are frequent flashbacks to earlier years. I don't think Italy gets as much attention in fiction as other WW II locales; it gets more attention in film. I'd put this novel right alongside \"Two Women\" as meaningful tales of war. The narration beautifully combines several things: realistic (sometimes heartbreaking and sometimes ennobling) war details; complex personal stories, including love and unwise romantic choices; magnificent renderings of Italian farm life amidst a lovely Tuscan villa and its small tenant farms; and brilliant information on Renaissance art, art restoration, and German theft and plunder of cultural treasures. Olafsson brings all the threads together stylishly. It left me rather breathless to consider the depths of both loyalty and betrayal, both destruction and survival that Olafsson portrays. Alice, the English Marchesa Orsini, is a superbly drawn character, as is Kristin, the Icelandic artist."}, {"userName": "Sterlingcindysu", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946086-sterlingcindysu", "userReview": "I interrupted this book to read others, so don't think that it took me the whole month to read it. Olafsson really packs alot into this (btw, I have to check if that's his real name). There's art and WWI and remodeling an Italian villa (shades of house hunters international here). I think he could have either expanded it at least another 100 pages, or eliminated one of the subplots and it still would have worked fine. If you're stretched for time, this is a great book to read and feel smart about learning all these different things and Olafsson moves the plot right along. I hadn't read the review here on Goodreads, which really goes waaayyy too much into the plot. A sad story with much death and not much redemption. If the title is a play on words, I don't think Alice restored much of her life or even Pritchett or Kristen for that matter. I received an ARC which I left much too long on the TBR shelf. OK, I checked on Olaf Olafsson's name and he's bona fide! Now I understand Kristen's background. Amazing how he finds time to write."}], "description": "Raised within a cosseted circle of British ex-pats in Florence, Alice shocked her family and friends when she married Claudio. Despite the protests of both families, they found a crumbling villa on a windy Tuscan hilltop, called San Martino, and they poured themselves into the house and the land\u2013and what they built together bound them together. They had a son. They finished the house. They were happy.But away from her family and the ease of life to which she was accustomed, Alice begins to slip into a vast and encompassing loneliness. She stumbles into an ill-advised affair with a childhood sweetheart that increasingly takes her away from San Martino and into the social swirl of wartime Rome. She is with her lover when her young son dies from meningitis\u2026and her unbearable sorrow is compounded by terrible guilt. Her indiscretion is noticed by a careful pair of eyes\u2013those of Robert Marshall, the master restorer and dealer of renaissance art. In exchange for his silence, he demands Alice hide a priceless Caravaggio at San Martino, a national treasure that he has sold to the Germans. Neither knows, however, that the Caravaggio is, in fact, a fake, painted by Marshall\u2019s assistant as revenge for Marshall\u2019s scorning her as a lover and returning to his pregnant wife. Kristin had merely hoped to privately humiliate Marshall. But his sale of the forgery has placed him in far great danger than she anticipated. Compelled to make things right, she travels to San Martino in an attempt to destroy the painting. Meanwhile, inconsolable at the death of his son and at his wife\u2019s betrayal, Claudio retreats first into silence, and then into an actual absence. He has left, without saying good-bye, without offering the grieving Alice a chance to redeem herself for her ghastly sin. As WWII moves towards its inexorable conclusion, as the front lines sweeps closer and closer to San Martino, Alice and Kristin not only have to confront the onslaught of soldiers and the destruction of everything they hold dear, but also the consequences of their past mistakes.", "title": "Restoration", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11687869-restoration", "average": 3.55, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1319565201l/11687869.jpg", "reviews": 125, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4939125.Olaf_Olafsson", "name": "Olaf Olafsson"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Cultural", "War", "Art"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11687869-restoration", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16118971-restauracija", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34217585-one-station-away", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/389215.The_Journey_Home", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1256751.Walking_Into_the_Night", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/848287.Absolution", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/240566.Valentines"]}
