I wasn't at all sure of it in the very beginning, though I did think it was well-written from its start (Shields always has such a lovely, 'easy' style), but it picked up quickly, once the main character started interacting with her sister at the home of their difficult mother.

Just a little too much Deus Ex Machina in this book, though.Shutting my eyes again, I tense, waiting for fear to reassume its grip on me, but it doesn't come.The sun has brought with it a calm perspective... 79/161A determined indifference is the perfect cure for anxiety. 79...for Watson friendship was not a pleasing dispensation of existence but a means, the only means he knew, by which he could be certain of his own existence. 80He says it's a question of Puritan ethic: you can only enjoy what you have laboriously worked for. Pleasure must be paid for by sacrifice, at least for those like us. It must not come too easily or too soon. 99...all those poets had been telling the truth after all; anguish could be scooped up and dealt with. My loneliness could, by my secret gift of alchemy, be shaped into a less frightening form. I was going to survive - I soon saw that - and my survival was hooked into my quirky, accidental ability to put words into agreeable arrangements. I could even remake my childhood, that great void in which nothing had happened but years and years of shrivelling dependence, I wrote, as one critic said, \"from the floor of a bitter heart.\" 117Kindness, kindness - a skill which I have nourished and rehearsed and worried into being - had jumped out and taken me by surprise. Without thinking, without laborious reflection I had fallen into its easy litany. Even more surprising, it had given me a temporary ascendancy; my mother had been silenced; perhaps kindness and bravery have a common root. 157"}, {"userName": "Sterlingcindysu", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/946086-sterlingcindysu", "userReview": "Good writing lasts and that is what carries this book. Written in 1977, the plot wouldn't stand up now. It's not just a matter of cell phones and the internet, but people's stance on various matters. For example, cancer survivors in their 70's are marrying and there's some discussion on \"why would they want to do that?\" and \"should I even get a gift? They have everything already.\" Of course, it must be a small affair and no one even thinks about flowers, food (other than cake), music or even chairs at the ceremony even though family arrives five days ahead of time. The wedding dress sounds horrible. I'm nit-picking the details. The story itself is fine, characters well fleshed-out and act normally and lots of scenic descriptions of Canada. Loved the 1970s prices of things--ha! $15 for a haircut, and that's how much my supercuts still charges!For once, I think it's a great cover. I see there's a companion book, but eek, only available as an ebook from my library."}, {"userName": "Amardip", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5942002-amardip", "userReview": "This novel is a companion to \"Small Ceremonies\". The main character in this novel, Charleen, is the sister of the main character, Judith, in \"Small Ceremonies\". Charleen seems somewhat locked into her ordinary misfortune of having a sour mother, being divorced, and raising her teenaged son on a meager income. Charleen, being a poet, is a bit of a navel-gazer, but I could identify with her difficulty in moving on with her life and enjoying the life that she has. As always, Carol Shields has a such a gift for writing and illuminating the ordinary, that I wanted to befriend Charleen and give her a hug. Most of the supporting characters are well-developed, although a few did seem like caricatures (Greta) or a little one-dimensional (Seth). I enjoyed the subtle humour and wry observations. Not for the action-hero buff but highly recommend to those who enjoy character-driven novels and especially those who are fans of Carol Shields' writing."}, {"userName": "Bambi", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4662468-bambi", "userReview": "Carol Shields is an excellent writer. She writes in such a real way. I feel like old friends with her. I love her characters and her descriptions. This book is not as good as the Stone Diaries but it is not bad either. This story focuses on a family who have grown apart and find themselves back together for a wedding for their aging mother. The main character in the book, Char is a poet who has suffered loss. She finds refuge in her job at a Botanical journal for the college and in the love of her teenage son. This book deals with a lot of memories and flashback but not in a dull way. The flashback are told in a conversational way. This is a good quick read that will leave you thinking about the character of person you allow in your life. It will also make you chuckle.

I adored Happenstance, The Republic of Love, Swann, Larry's Party, Unless, and -- of course -- The Stone Diaries. While this novel finally won me over, it wasn't until the last quarter of the book. If I wasn't already a committed Carol Shields fan, I would have stopped reading long before that point.

I think it has a \"mature chick lit\" theme. I do find the comments in the Amazon.com review, about how now Charleen would be given Prozac and sent on her way, both insulting and untrue. It is insulting from the standpoint that most competent doctors do not believe medication treats social issues and existential angst. I find it untrue in that Charleen does not appear depressed or anxious; she seems to be redefining herself after her life has been turned upside down, and it takes going back to where she started to find out how far she has come, and how strong and independent she is now. The twists and turns weren't hard to figure out, but didn't seem forced or contrived. I enjoyed the novel.

It's a fairly early work so it was interesting to see the elements that would later become so better realized in The Stone Diaries. What's really strong here is her peripheral characters, particularly her mother, lover, son, sister and mother's fiance. They were so real to me in a way that the narrator didn't seem to be. It's a bit dated but still a lovely read, if only for the sense of a moment of contentment on a train ride across Canada."}, {"userName": "Kirsten", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/349438-kirsten", "userReview": "I always forget how much I love Carol Shields. She is just stunning and amazing. The early part of this book felt dated to me - it was published in 1977 - and reminded me a lot of early Margaret Atwood (another Canadian, of course!). The character of Charleen is rather passive and neurotic, but in a familiar (to me) kind of way. It really picks up and finds its center when we meet the sister and the mother. The characters and the relationships are so finely drawn and so true to life. The ending is a bit abrupt and could have had more to it, but this is still a fine book."}, {"userName": "Tekapope", "userReviewDate": "Jun 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6725196-tekapope", "userReview": "Outdated in a lot of references, but I enjoyed the conflicted and sometimes contradictory characters (mosty how the narrator feels toward everyone \u2013 love, despair, boredom, etc.) She goes hom for her old mom's wedding and her friend that's caring for her son kidnaps him to see his dad.

In this novel, the reader follows Charleen Forrest, a divorcee in the 1970s, as she grapples with poverty, divorce, and long-standing family resentments. The prose--and the plot challenges--may seem very dated to the modern reader, but it's still an enjoyable story.

I like the way she made me care about these very simple and ordinary people.
