Could you resist that last glimmer of hope?This is the dilemma facing Mark Wiseman. While standing at his wife's graveside and looking down on her casket, a man tells him he can give her back to him.

Straight ahead and right to the point, Orchid a wonderful tale about love, loss and not being able to let go, even if your own soul is at stake. A great story that will make more than a few readers stop and ponder decisions they have made in their own life.

Would you defy death to change your destiny? Would you make a deal with the devil? Orchid is a dark, poignant tale detailing what lengths a man will go to keep the woman he loves with him. Mark is offered a deal he could not refuse, unfortunately true to human nature, he never imagined the cost or the consequences of his choices. The story that unwinds from one decision made in the throws of anguish and despair is overflowing with heartbreaking betrayals and mind numbing revelations.If something seems to good to be true, it usually is and sometimes it can cost you your very soul.Orchid is a well written, amazing short read that left me spellbound and full of anticipation to read more Tales of The Black Sabbath."}, {"userName": "Scott Stevens", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17857954-scott-stevens", "userReview": "Orchid: Tales of the Black Sabbath starts with a mood that's dark and gets darker. What's not to like about this horror short? It is a great cross-section of O'Neill's crisp writing found in his vampire-led The Dracula Chronicles series. Right from chapter one it reminded me a bit of the suspense and ominous moodiness of Stephen King's Bachman works. When the creepy stranger appears graveside at the end of the first chapter appealing to the fresh widower, \"Just don't let them bury her,\" you know full well he'll take the bait and you're not putting this down until you finish."}, {"userName": "Maer", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6988142-maer", "userReview": "The choice to bring a lost loved one back from the dead is explored in O'Neill's short story in a new and very different way. This story packs in the angst of Mark, who has lost his beloved wife, his dilemma over choosing what he wants versus what he knows is right. This story is a well written, dark horror story that stays with you long after you finish it. O'Neill has a talent for painting pictures that draw you in - whether you want to go where he leads or not! Beware the dark paths this talented author creates because we all know that going down them comes with a price.Highly recommend!"}, {"userName": "Roy Huff", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15061761-roy-huff", "userReview": "4.5 stars. Short, dark, and disturbing. This is only 4.5 stars because it was a little on the short side, but that's where my complaints end. This story is just creepy and dark enough to make it interesting, but doesn't try to be something that it's not. It feels authentic and has an intriguing take on insanity, love, and the undead. I don't want to give to much away, but if you like paranormal or horror, you will most likely enjoy this one."}, {"userName": "John Dolan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12447371-john-dolan", "userReview": "Fans of Shane O'Neill's 'Dracula Chronicles' will enjoy this short story.It contains the author's hallmark blend of horror, visceral violence and compelling narrative. I personally prefer O'Neill's writing when it contains more of an epic historical trajectory, but nonetheless I've rounded up my 4.5 stars to 5, and will be interested to see where he goes with 'Tales of the Black Sabbath'."}, {"userName": "Ashen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11112583-ashen", "userReview": "I thoroughly enjoyed Shane O'Neill's first foray into short, erotic horror. Understanding the roots of the story, and the inspiration behind it, I was interested to see how Mr. O'Neill would treat the subject matter, which has the potential of being either very creepy and frightening, or, at the other extreme, farcical. I am happy to say that Shane delivers a solid, well written short, giving us just enough of the background we need to keep the tale flowing, while managing to keep us away from the inherent sorrow that Mark Wiseman's situation engenders.The other aspect of this tale that pleases me so much is that it is well-written and, for a self-published work, well-edited. When there is so much dross around in the SP world, it is good to see that Mr. O'Neill is one of those few writers who cares about the work he produces, and that benefits both writer and reader alike.I am looking forward to more from Shane in this series."}, {"userName": "Christoph Fischer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13998364-christoph-fischer", "userReview": "\u201cOrchid\u201d by Shane KP O\u2019Neill is a terrific horror short that really took me by surprise. The story begins low key at a Jewish funeral where Mark bemoans the sudden death of his wife Orchid. But a mystery figure offers him to bring her back, as long as the wife is not buried; a tough decision to make for the fresh widower.The story is dark, moody and written in an almost hypnotising prose that creeps slowly under your skin and stays there is an unsettling way yet you want to know what will happen. The scene is set with attention to detail and love for the genre, much in the style of the psychological horror of the Dracula movies. This is a very scary and well written short; very impressive!"}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14356900-rebecca", "userReview": "When feeling your most vulnerable losing the one person you cherish and love above all, dies.

Had to read all of it at once. It takes a good story to catch me that way. I have never read horror before so I didn't know what to expect but I think I will read more such stories after reading this one. I could understand Mark's reaction and the choices he made. He didn't have much time to make that decision and he knew it was wrong. I was sitting with my heart in my throat at something of the things that happened. This writer is really mean to his characters. It was very good and I would recommend.

From the graveyard, to the pit of the rain soaked grave, to the appearance of a sinister cryptic character, to all that comes after, Orchid is an enjoyable short story worthy of the genre label 'Horror'.
