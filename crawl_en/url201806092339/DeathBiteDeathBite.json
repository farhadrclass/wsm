No one is safe because once they bite you; you become a flesh eater too. Watch out! It is a Zombie apocalypse.Jason, Alex, Marissa, Jessica, and Jake are one group of non-flesh eaters who are trying to keep humanity safe. They are armed to the teeth with guns because the easiest way to get rid of a flesh eater is with a bullet to the brain. The team must reach the hospital to get medicine to keep the survivors safe and protected. Each time they go out, could be their last and they know that they are all that stands between the flesh eaters and the few remaining humans left alive. Death Bite is a scary story that really could happen! I could imagine that the government would have a secret weapon that they would use to stop wars, but of course not realize that it actually changes the people into something worse! Realizing their mistake, the government has developed a new weapon to take out the flesh eaters but the government\u2019s weapon doesn\u2019t distinguish between flesh eaters or non-flesh eaters\u2026 when the bomb hits, all flesh melts causing a painful death. I identified with Jessica and Marissa as women who have faced their worst nightmare\u2026 their children becoming flesh eaters\u2026 and learning how to fight to stay alive. Death Bite is a quick read filled with action and graphic gore! Flesh eaters wandering around with organs hanging out, trying to capture the non-flesh eaters. Then there is the understanding that no one is safe\u2026including the team because if they get bit, they will face a bullet to the brain rather than turning. Or if you get caught in the mist from the government\u2019s bomb, you will literally melt to death. But to protect our world, a few good men and women must step up and fight. Death Bite is the story of five courageous people who face a daunting task."}, {"userName": "Paul Cook", "userReviewDate": "Sep 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5393768-paul-cook", "userReview": "Zombies, blood and plenty of gore to be had inside this bad boy!!
