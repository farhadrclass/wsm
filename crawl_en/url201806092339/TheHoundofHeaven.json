If so, you may be inspired and moved this Francis Thompson ode. Perhaps it is fitting that, during the fin de siecle, when religious poetry was in fashion among the English aesthetes, that one of the greatest poems of Christian faith was composed by a derelict, an opiate addict who wandered the London streets with a small volume of Blake in one pocket and a volume of Aeschylus in the other.Francis Thompson, born in Lancashire to a middle class Catholic family, was a dreamy, impractical young man. Rejected from the priesthood, Francis made a half-hearted attempt to become a physician like his father, but, after failing medical school, he left for London to seek his fortune as a writer at the age of 25. But a lack of practicality hampered his career, as did a growing addiction to laudanum. Soon he was reduced to selling pencils, delivering messages, and tending horses by day, and by night he slept in a large box near the hobo camps by the Thames. Desperate, he was on the verge of ending it all when the poet and suicide Thomas Chatterton, appearing to him in a dream, dissuaded him from taking his own life.Fortunately, he eventually found a pair of patrons: Francis Meynell editor of the Catholic magazine Merry England and his wife, the poet Alice Meynell. They recognized both his genius and his helplessness, and acted informally as his guardians for most of the rest of his short life. When he died at the age of 47, he left behind him a few handfuls of good poems and one great poem, \u201cThe Hound of Heaven.\u201dSure, it is a little too full of sin and self-abasement for most contemporary Christians, many of whom\u2014I suspect--are a little too full of themselves. It is also shamelessly old fashioned both in its diction and the extravagance of its religious ardor, but a few old words never hurt anybody, and the saints were known to be passionate about religion too. At the very least, \u201cThe Hound of Heaven\u201d\u2014in addition to being honest, direct, and filled with an extraordinary music\u2014paints an unforgettable picture of the Lord Jesus as a hound continually on the track of the sinner, never ceasing until the pursued one comes to realize that His pursuit is the pursuit of Love.Here are the first few lines, to give you an idea of what is in store:\nI fled Him, down the nights and down the days;\u00a0\u00a0 I fled Him, down the arches of the years;I fled Him, down the labyrinthine ways\u00a0\u00a0 Of my own mind; and in the midst of tearsI hid from Him, and under running laughter.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Up vistaed hopes I sped;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And shot, precipitated,Adown Titanic glooms of chasmed fears,\u00a0\u00a0 From those strong Feet that followed, followed after.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 But with unhurrying chase,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 And unperturb\u00e8d pace,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Deliberate speed, majestic instancy,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 They beat\u2014and a Voice beat\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 More instant than the Feet\u2014\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 'All things betray thee, who betrayest Me'."}, {"userName": "Jon(athan) Nakapalau", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58774673-jon-athan-nakapalau", "userReview": "Run as far and as fast as your days will allow - the hunt that ends your days was your life - you and the hound will obey the voice of your master - one in the same."}, {"userName": "Ann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/90972-ann", "userReview": "\"The Hound of Heaven\" is one of the most beautiful and insightful poems ever written. It is a perfect word picture of deviant, depraved, defiant Man running, running, running from God...from Love...who is personified as the Hound of heaven. Thompson's skillful and brilliant use of language is unsurpassed. Man's senseless, blind flight from God takes him \"across the margent of the world...to the gold gateways of the stars\", mindlessly thinking he can hide from Him - \"I said to Dawn: Be sudden\u2014to Eve: Be soon; With thy young skiey blossoms heap me over From this tremendous Lover\u2014Float thy vague veil about me, lest He see!\" How foolish - how childlike - we are.The fear that drives the flight is always this: \"For,though I knew His love Who follow\u00e8d, Yet was I sore adread Lest, having Him, I must have naught beside.\" We run from Him seeking everything but Him, knowing in our heart of hearts that ending the chase means yieldedness...surrender. What a stiff-necked race is humankind. And yet He follows calling, wooing, loving open-armed: \"Still with unhurrying chase, And unperturb\u00e8d pace,Deliberate speed, majestic instancy, Came on the following Feet, And a Voice above their beat\u2014\u2018Naught shelters thee, who wilt not shelter Me.\u2019\"This poem and its timeless truths and themes has stood me in good stead over and over as I guided five children through the difficult passage of childhood to adulthood. I've often gently reminded each restless, wistful, sometimes broken - sometimes angry, teenage heart that they are simply running from the Hound of Heaven. The inspired, profound truth and beauty in this poem always bends my knee to the Lord of Lords - sorry and shamed...again...that I've run from the Hound of Heaven."}, {"userName": "Karen L.", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/312471-karen-l", "userReview": "This poem is absolutely beautiful.

One is taken on a transcendental voyage of internal and literal realities, encapsulated within an evangelical experimental work of epic proportions. This enduring, eternal tale is one that has been re-told many times over; within the works of creative genius\u2019 throughout the generations. I have to concur with G E. Veith\u2019s view as this being \u2018one of the greatest Christian poems\u2019, for the veracity of verisimilitude within the verse is truly astonishing. \n \u201cAll which thy child\u2019s mistakeFancies are lost. [\u2026]\u2018Ah, fondest, blindest, weakest,I am He Whom thou sleekest!\u201d \n F. Thompson\u2019s poem tells the tale of a wealthy young man addicted to Opium in Victorian England, who is saved by God\u2019s grace \u2013 as represented within the metaphor of \u2018the hound\u2019 (of God\u2019s footprints beside him). The ironic undercurrent is within the author\u2019s own personal story \u2013 as Francis Thompson was a man who after rebelling against his forceful Father, lost himself in London. Therein lies the paradox of probability, when it wasn\u2019t until he lay in the gloomy gutter of hopeless horrors did he have an epiphany! It was this ascension of arisen vision, when F. Thompson decided to write this paradoxical poem of potential possibility \u2013 a classic of continuum. \nWhen wondering the wilderness of confused, conflicting realities it is actually not by the grace of God that the main protagonist [and author] is \u201csaved\u201d \u2013 rather that by reflecting upon wrongdoing, \u2018he\u2019 is inherently saving himself.\n \u2018Post tenebras lux!\u2019 \n \nWhere there is HOPE there is life."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2631425-michael", "userReview": "Three stars for the poem (on a first reading, possibly to be revised), with an extra half-star for the woodcut illustrations, rounded up to four stars (as it feels like that's probably where I'll end up with it).I spotted this one on the shelf of Great Grandfather's Bookshop in Leyland, Lancashire, struck by the front cover illustration, then half remembering the title, then fully remembering the opening lines, though I can't quite place from where: the introduction to another book of poetry, I'm sure, but which one I can't recall. The disappointment of the slightly torn dust jacket and internal staining were ameliorated by the \u00a31.50 price mark penciled in the front, so it ended up coming home with me. I recognised the author's name, too, and looking him up I was pleasantly surprised to discover that he was born in Winkley Street in Preston, a street I walk down each week, and his name I recognise from the plaque hung there to commemorate his birth in the city. I'll pay more attention to it on my next visit. As for the poem itself, it's written in a highly wrought Romantic style. I'm not entirely adverse to that, but at times it feels like it was laid on a bit thick. However, in the vastly more important opinion of J.R.R. Tolkien, Thompson is to be \"ranked amongst the very greatest of poets\" (The J.R.R. Tolkien Companion and Guide, Volume 1: Chronology, page 51), so there's that to recommend him.Tolkien would, I'm sure, be drawn to the Catholic sentiment of The Hound of Heaven, in which the Hound is Christ, who lovingly hunts the lost soul of the poem's narrator, a biographical theme given Thompson's loss of faith, destitution, drug-addiction and ultimate return to the Christian fold. For myself, if I'm to get anything from the poem beyond the poetic imagery, and the rhythm and rhyme, it will be as symbolic of the finding of the Self in a psychological sense. I didn't find it in this, my first, reading, but I strongly suspect it's lying in wait for me in there, somewhere."}, {"userName": "Justin Howe", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/173167-justin-howe", "userReview": "\"And pulled my life upon me; grimed with smears,I stand amid the dust o\u2019 the mounded years\u2014My mangled youth lies dead beneath the heap.My days have crackled and gone up in smoke,Have puffed and burst as sun-starts on a stream.\"Yup.

More to come in review after class discussion (hopefully). First: This sets the stage. A man is running from God, not literally, but fleeing from him through the years. Meaning that for all his life he has avoided God. Second: He flees to hearts, to the comfort of human love. Then he flees to science, which betrays him \"in [its] constancy\". And again we end with the contrasting difference between the fleeing man and the Pursuer. The former chaotic and spasmodic almost, while the later is firm, constant, walking \"unperturbed\" after. Third: He sees in the innocence of the children the truth, but it is not how he should learn of this truth. God wants him to discover it in another way. Her turns then to nature. He \"was one\" in that fellowship, but \"not by that, by that, was eased [his] human smart.\" Nature cannot satisfy his desire for love because it is below him. Nature is beautiful, it is wonderful, and he can connect to it in a certain way, but \"they speak by silences\". They have a different language. They work by instinct, not by will as he does. Fourth: He has nothing left to run to. His dreams have failed. His youth \"lies dead beneath the heap\", making you feel that he has wasted away his life, that, for all his trying, nothing he did gave life to his memories of his past. He asks if God's love is a love that casts out all other loves. He seems to think that if he accepts the love of God, he can have nothing else. \"The pulp so bitter, how shall taste the rind?\" Coming to God, discovering his love, knowing of it, all this has been a bitter experience for the man, so how bitter shall be the love of God itself when he accepts it? Fifth: He thought he was going to lose everything by accepting the love of God. But God says to him, \"Lo, all things fly thee, for thou fliest Me!\" That love from other things (humans) needs meriting, but the man cannot gain merit, so he cannot gain that love. Then the man finally realizes that what he fears was not what the love of God truly is. \"Is my gloom, after all, Shade of his hand, outstretched caressingly?\" \"Ah, fondest, blindest, weakest, I am He Whom thou seekest!Thou dravest love from thee, who dravest Me.\" God was not chasing. The man was not fleeing. God was being driven away from the man."}, {"userName": "William Lytle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19085358-william-lytle", "userReview": "Very helpful in my current study of both James Joyce and Gerard Manley Hopkins.

Every new revelation of God's power and wisdom which science unfolds serves only to restore a balance in our mind between God's power and God's love.
