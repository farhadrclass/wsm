I thought it was fresh and original, not to mention fun and exciting. Then Captivate and Entice came along and were not only awful, but so awful that they actually ruined Need for me. And now Endure has come back to reclaim part of my heart. I loved it so much and it definitely now has a place in my heart.\nTHE HEROINE\nZARAZara really comes into her own in this book. She takes charge in a way that she never has in the past and it's so beautiful to see. She really takes responsibility and control and learns to make the hard decisions even when she doesn't want to. She genuinely tries to do what's right and seems to honestly do an excellent job. I love how she finally steps up and does what needs to be done.\nTHE LOVE INTERESTS\nASTLEYY'all already know that I am totally in love with the \u00fcber-sexy Astley, so there's really no point in trying to hide it. I could totally go into all the ways he reminds me of my boyfriend, but you guys do not read my reviews to get the details on my love life so I will skip that haha. BUT ANYWAY. Astley is totally awesome in this book. I'm trying to figure out how to write this section without turning it into a gushfest, but so far that is proving impossible. I could literally spend this entire review talking about how sexy this darling blond pixie is. He is like...amazing. I would totally push Zara off a cliff if it meant I could have him. He's sweet but strong, dangerous but somehow still tame, and just plain fantastic. God, I'm gonna shut up before this review actually does turn into me obsessing over Astley.NICKIt's not that I don't like Nick. Or at least, I didn't used to dislike Nick, not in Need or in Captivate. Even in Entice, he didn't really seem so bad. But in Endure, at least in the beginning, he kind of acts like a jerk and a b brat and is completely self-absorbed and prejudiced. He does get a little better, and I can understand his actions to a point, but mostly I just wanted to slap some sense into him and make him behave. There was no excuse for him to be so rude, not really.\nTHE BEST FRIEND\nISSIEAs...unique as I find Issie, I concede that she had some absolutely awesome lines in this one. She really reveals some amazing, deep things and does so in this really great way. I actually really liked her in this book and was very impressed by her bravery.\nTHE PLOT\nThe plot of Endure was fast-paced and fun. I almost never got a moment to breathe because I was anticipating something. The amount of tension was incredible and I was very often at the edge of my seat with wide eyes wondering how they would get out of this one and what would happen next.The amount of action was unbelievable, but it was so great! I could barely put this book down and even risked bringing it out of my house (I have automysophobia issues that extend to things I own, books in particular) just so that I could keep reading it.It was original, and I feel like I learned a lot about Norse mythology. I've only read like a few other books that I can think of with Norse mythology, and so I feel that this one really helped rectify that.Some things I really didn't like. There was one thing in particular that I found unspeakably stupid and even though it was undone at the end of the book, it totally ticked me off and caused me to lower my rating more than I ordinarily would have.I basically completely adored this plot and literally could not get enough of it. I could have read it extended for hours and I honestly adored it so much.\nTHE ROMANCE\nHonestly, there wasn't a ton of romance in this book which was both good and bad. It was good because I loved how Carrie didn't focus and make this a love story, but really made it about the plot and what was happening. That was awesome, and I really admire that. But I still wish there had been more romance! There was some. Zara comes to her decision, which I was either happy or unhappy with. It's really heartbreaking and beautiful how she comes to her choice and I definitely found myself repressing tears. It was executed absolutely gorgeously and I loved it.\nTHE ENDING\nMuch like Destined, another four-book series that came to a stunning conclusion lately, I really feel like Endure reached the absolute best ending possible. I really loved it and felt that it was truly the best thing that could have come. I was totally and utterly satisfied and so ridiculous happy when I finished. It was the perfect ending, and I could not have loved it more.\nWRAPUP\nDespite its faults, Endure was awesome and I would highly recommend it. Despite the faults of Captivate and Entice, I think Endure is so very definitely worth reading. Will I read future Carrie Jones books? Probably. Despite the fact that I am still recovering from the mess that was After Obsession, I think I will. Carrie writes romance like no one else, and she has incredible twists and plots.FINE.Read more of my reviews on Sparkles and Lightning!---My pre-review:Pretty please, Carrie Jones\u2026 Astley and Zara are so meant to be together.

Wish it was A LOT longer, but oh well! Release date: 5-8-12Okay. I'm going to start this review by mentioning my feelings towards the rest of this series. I adored the first book. I thought that the story was unique, the action was really well done, and I loved the romance. The characters were all characters that I fell in love with instantly. The second and third book seemed to get progressively worse in my opinion, but I still enjoyed them enough to be very excited to read Endure as soon as I recieved it. Despite the fact that I didn't really enjoy Entice, I had to know how this series would end.My head is spinning after reading this book. It was super short, and I read it in one sitting, but the book seemed to fly by so quickly it's difficult to gather my thoughts.We start out pretty much where we left off. Nick is being mean to Zara, and she is heartbroken because he is treating her like a piece of trash. She saved Nick from Valhalla, but the evil pixies aren't giving up. Grandma Betty is still not around. Zara needs to form an army of good pixies with her friends and anyone she can gather up to help fight. All of this is going on while she tries to deal with her feelings about Nick, and her pixie king, Astley. Finally, the end of the world is predicted and Zara supposedly has something to do with it.This book was all about the action, and the unexpected. So many things happen that you just wouldn't expect, which makes the book constantly holding your attention. There is never one dull moment in this book. There is honestly not much to say about this book without giving away any spoilers, so I'm just going to leave you with a few reasons why I love this series, and really love Zara!This quote sums up why I love Zara, despite her flaws.\"This is why you are chosen. Not because of who your father is, not because you turned pixie queen. It is because you choose to look beyond the ugly. You choose to see the good even in monsters, Zara White. That is why you are different. That is why you are important.\"Also, Zara really releases her inner' badass in this book. When called a \"little girl\" she simply spears the person and whispers \"Sorry, you chose the wrong side. Plus, you made 'little girl' seem like a bad thing\"The absolute only thing I didn't like about this book was how the romance was kind of skimpy. By skimpy I mean there really was none until the last 30 pages. I understand that this story was focusing on the apocolypse and all, but a little more romance would have been appreciated. Zara got more lip action from a girl than either of the guys! Just sayin'. No matter which boy you hope Zara ends up with I think you will enjoy the ending. I've never really said which boy I liked so it's okay to say that I am VERY happy with the ending.I recommend all Need fans read this book. How can you not? You truly \"need\" to find out the ending of the story of this loveable girl who we first met muttering random phobias; the girl who went from never wanting to hurt a fly to a girl willing to kill for what she believes in and for those she loves. This is an ending that will not disappoint! I'm sad to see it end, but it's been one heck of a ride. Thank you Carrie Jones!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4581159-jennifer", "userReview": "YAY! Cover and description!

After all, pixies aren't a paranormal creature I see a lot in the YA genre. Couple that with the use of Norse god mythology and you have a truly original series. All that being said, I do not think this was a strong conclusion, but I did still enjoy myself along the way.Sometimes what I really dislike about reading a series while they are still being written is the lengthy waits. By the time I get to the next book, I can barely remember who each character is or their background. This is especially frustrating when the novel picks up directly or shortly after the last book ends. But Jones handles that fairly well with small recaps on the important info that happen in the previous novels. So even if it's been a year or more since you've read Entice, rest assured that you will most likely be able to keep up just fine.Endure opens with Betty still missing and Nick still not very accepting of Zara being a pixie. It's a trying time for her and she has her share of FML moments, but I never thought they were over done. I think everyone is entitled to their own pity party when your boyfriend can stand the sight (and smell) of you. Zara and the gang have a lot on their plate in Endure since Frank is causing even more trouble trying to bring an end to the world.\u00a0And then there is Astly, who Zara isn't entirely sure how she feel about. \u00a0But unlike other heroines, Zara pushes her personal feelings aside to deal with the real matter at hand -- saving the world. I loved that about her because for once we have a heroine that realizes they have a job to do instead of moping around crying about her love life. But this comes as no surprise to me as I have always loved Zara as a main character. She's smart, compassionate (yet not to the point of having no self-preservation), and hilarious.Still, there are a few things that irritated me a bit:Nick -- I really don't know what happened to his character over the course of this series. But I don't like it. To put it bluntly, he was an ass in Endure.\u00a0Straight up. Zara went to Valhalla to rescue him. She changed into a pixie for him, which she was strongly opposed to at first, and what does the little prick do? He completely shuns her because she is different. Later in the novel, a situation arises where she becomes human again and he has the nerve to show interest in her! Thankfully, Zara is a smarter than the average bear and does not accept his advances.The Norse mythology --\u00a0It went right over my head. At first it was interesting in the pervious books because it's not often done, but it got more and more complicated. This book is only 262 pages and I don't think that was enough time to properly explore it fully. Somehow Zara is the key to stopping the apocalypse by freeing Loki, but then she's not supposed to free Loki because that actually starts the apocalypse?? I was very confused. I don't even think the characters knew what they were talking about. In fact, it's pretty clear they didn't considering the Norse gods were always correcting them on their information. Their response?It seemed like a rather convenient excuse to explain away things that aren't fully explained in the first place. Don't get me wrong, I think it's pretty accurate for modern teens to find out everything they need to know from the University of Google. But it's another thing entirely for them to fully believe everything they read as much as was done in Endure.\u00a0It was like:\"Oh noz! How do we stop the apocalypse?\"*fires up Google**answer found**world saved*\nGo on and push it. I know you want to...\u00a0The Ending -- It really felt like Jones was just on a mission to hurry up and end the series. Overall I'm happy with the ending, but not the process in which it arrived there. But I really believe that it mostly comes back to things being a little too convenient for Zara and her friends.However, even with those issues and not fully understanding the how everything connected together, I still was able to enjoy the novel. As for who Zara ends up with, well, let's just say I think fans will be very happy with the outcome. I know I was. ;)ARC was provided by Bloomsbury via NetGalley.

Need was the first of her books I read, and I thought it was okay her writing was choppy and hard to read, but the characters were there, not to mention the whole phobia thing. How cool is that?!Captivate, Need's sequel, took me even further into the world of Zara White and her friends, human and pixie alike, and I became infatuated with Jones's series. Entice made me love it. Imagine my heartbreak and disappointment when I found out this book was out a whole YEAR after Entice and, even then, kept getting pushed back.Finally, a solid May release date got announced, and I just couldn't wait. I really enjoyed After Obsession, too, even though it had no ties to Jones's Need world and featured a brand-spanking-new co-author.Endure, even though I never really liked the title (at all), was the best book in the series for me. I feel like Carrie's writing has improved since the series started. Say goodbye to her former, choppier style of writing -- while that is warranted in some places during Endure, Carrie 2.0 has been released and is much an improvement. My favorite part of Endure is the end -- no, I'm not going to spoil it for you -- because it wrapped up the series perfectly. And -- *hint, hint* -- I always love the flash-forward-in-time epilogues. :DThe love interest in the series has always been a bit of a toss-up for me. In most series, you can usually guess who the MC will decide to end up with. Endure wasn't like that at all -- I honestly had no idea and felt like it was a flip-of-a-coin move for Jones. Either one would've benefited Zara in the long run, and I am quite happy with who she did end up with. About those boys . . . *sigh* I feel like they were being really possessive and stupid throughout the entire book. Up until the end, I think neither of them deserved Zara and that what they really deserved was a frying pan to the face, but they redeemed themselves and stopped acting like idiots.I loved the Norse mythology, even though I felt like a lot of it was thrown in my face. I overall just really enjoyed Endure.One thing is for darned sure -- Carrie Jones sure can write an ending."}, {"userName": "Hannah-Linn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4102915-hannah-linn", "userReview": "HOLY GOD FINALLY!!!

I swear, if Astly wasnt there, i would have given it 1 star. I always felt that Nick was some sort of typical, hormonal and angry jock type. Anyways, what really bugged me were the characters. All Zara did was act like a sissy, not that pacifism is bad, but this is an extreme case. Also, everyone was, initially at least, so focused on the fact that pixies were supposedly \"evil\" that they missed the fact that humans are NOT all sugar and spice and everything, so i believed them to be really hypocritical. I mean, not once in the first book or second did they stop to consider the fact that MAYBE THEY ARENT SO \"EVIL\". I really hate how the other made it so that everything was so simple.For ExamplePixies=EVILHumans=GOODAstly=EVILNick=GOODyou see where i'm going here. For someone who is suposed to be a \"good\" person, she is really bigoted. Anyway. In the beginning, i really hated Zara's character. All she would do is sit around, depressed, vehemently hating pixies, and chanting phobias to battle her fear of them. But i am surprised to say that she has grown out from all these annoying qualities. YET WHY DOES SHE STILL MAKE ME WANT TO SLAP HER!! It may have to do with the author's aweful attempts to inspire laughter. All of these were met with eye twitches and desperate searches for a fire source. If there was one more comparison between tinker bells and 'real' pixies........i would have had an epileptic fit. The only redeeming part of this isA)Zara understands that Nick is a sucks and Astly is amazing and B)She becomes a pixie who can actually hurt a fly/another pixie (of course not without a \"moral dilema\" shortly following after). But the biggest fault was that there was np earth-shattering climax. The ragnorak didn't happen, or rather she was able to stop it with the............wait for it..................... MAGIC OF LOVE. LLMMMMMMMMMFFFFFFFFFAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOO The sad/funny part here, you see, is that the previous sentence contains the truth and nothing but.

They become friends. People you feel like you know and care about.Silly, I know but that is always how I feel when I get immersed in a good series. It is sad seeing it end. Knowing that there will be no more adventures or romances or even heartache.So it was with a little bit of a sad heart that I picked up this book. Knowing it would be the end. That once I read that last page and closed it tight, it would be over for good. There would be no more adventures and heartache.But I also picked it up excited for the adventure to continue. To know how it would end. To hope for their happily ever after.And so it began and ultimately ended.I have always loved Nick in this series but I really wanted to smack him in this one. I really truly did. I felt so awful for Zara. It broke my heart seeing her pain, the way he spoke and talked and looked (or didn't in some cases) at her.Don't get me wrong, I expected some drama considering all that happened in the last book. Considering Zara became something Nick loathed, but I guess I had hoped that maybe he would be smarter than that. That maybe he would make it easy. That it wouldn't have to be such a struggle for him to see what was right in front of him.Zara becomes such a strong person. She is no longer the timid pacifist that she once was, afraid of so much, afraid of life really. She truly takes charge, stands on her own two feet and becomes what she was maybe destined to be all along, a queen and a leader. Someone destined to save the world.And Astley, yeah, he is just made of awesome and his character just gets better in this book.I even loved Hel, she was a great character. I couldn't help liking her.There is a lot that happens in this book, I mean it has to. It is the last one. So many people suffer and die.

This is the kind of book I want lots of pages to I can savor the story. Turn out, it didn't need it. My biggest complaint is that I read the other books a while ago and its hard to remember the plot/characters etc. because I've read so many other books in between. I read my reviews though so it helped a little.Anyway, in this conclusion Zara is still a pixie and Nick was just recently rescued and doesn't remember much about what happened. What really disappointed me though, was his revulsion towards Zara. I mean, this chic turned pixie to rescue him and got him back and his gratitude is to be repulsed by her? What an ass. I was more leaning towards Zara with Astley as of the last book and after the way Nick behaved right from page one, I lost all respect for him and was team Astley all the way.So, everyone is still fighting bad pixies and Zara's grandmother is still M.I.A., running around in tiger form somewhere. The conflict in this finale revolves around Zara trying to stop the apocolypse that is coming through Frank, their nemesis. Through many twists and turns and trips to Iceland, the gang learns the fate of the world and how it comes down to Zara saving it.I loved the writing and the story. Unexpected twists happen in this book as far as Zara and her character and things that happen to her along the way. She has many changes both physically & mentally. She grows up a lot and I like her character more in this book than any other.Very enjoyable ending to this series.

I am happier with how everything turned out more than I expected to be. I remember being really rooting for Zara and Nick, but this book completely made me switch teams within fifty pages or less. Zara saved Nick's life and because she had to turn pixie fully to do it he becomes such an immature ass! Then when she becomes human again he wants her back and Zara tells him like it is! I misjudged Astley big time. Now I love him and I'm happy Zara moved on to someone who has always appreciated her no matter what. Zara gets so much closure in this book and it wraps up the series nicely. The only thing I didn't like was that this book got the underworld and gods involved which didn't really fit well in my opinion and kind of dampened the story for me. But other than that it was good!"}, {"userName": "siobhan Quinlan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24176726-siobhan-quinlan", "userReview": "4 Cups of tea. I am sad to say i didnt love this book as much as the others in the series. I did really enjoy it but it was lacking something for me. I will be doing a full series review video for these. I found the whole series to be enjoyable and fast fun reads.Zara has really grown since Need and has started to come into her own. She is starting to become a character i really love. Astley for me is a better love interest and Nick needs a slap in the face with a shovel I cant believe how is acts."}], "description": "It\u2019s all-out war (and no-holds-barred romance) in the climactic conclusion to Carrie Jones\u2019s bestselling series.Zara is at the center of an impending apocalypse.
