Not written by a person but by an institute? 2. \"Personal Growth\" is the genre listed on the back--ugh! and 3. It just had cheesy corny all over it.And then, when I began reading, and everything felt horribly contrived...ok, WAS horribly contrived, I thought, how am I going to get through this. And then. THEN.The \"teaching\" characters in the book tell us this story of a military/political leader from 1187 AD who had remarkable successes and abilities. Why? They ask...what made him so admired? The answer:\"His heart was at peace.\" I kid you not. How in the universe could they possibly know that? I might have put the book down after that if it weren't for the fact that this is a book club book for next month and I'm hosting. So I plowed on. How did I get from 4 (or 5) strikes against to 4 stars? Somehow the personal interest of these fictionalized characters carried me along. Somehow the \"suspense\" of waiting to hear their answers to all of the world's worst problems kept me going until I began to find kernal after kernal of truth and insight. All of it building on itself. The book never moves past an idea until all of the \"characters\" understand it. Which is at once annoying and incredibly helpful. In short, I learned from this book, and my brain is still working on what it will mean for me and my relationships, how it might apply. But it makes sense and rings true. All without preaching a particular religious creed or value system. All without condemning anyone or anything.All just striving for peace in a very detailed, specific, and logical way. I don't know--in spite of myself, I'm convinced they have something here."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\u201cWe separate from each other at our peril.\u201d \u2015 The Arbinger Institute, The Anatomy of Peace: Resolving the Heart of Conflict\u201c...whenever I dehumanize another, I necessarily dehumanize all that is human---including myself.\u201d \u2015 The Arbinger Institute, The Anatomy of Peace: Resolving the Heart of ConflictIt is seldom I will actually praise a self-help or business-oriented book. They are usually pamphlets expanded, filled with bad writing, cliches, and seem destined to continually try to rebottle old wine. The Arbinger Institute's 'Anatomy of Peace' is a different bird in several ways. It isn't written by one person (although it is largely built from the work of philosopher C. Terry Warner), but rather by an organization. It has its faults and limitations, but is a constructive addition to conflict resolution. It builds on C. Terry Warner's ideas of self-deception, human emotions, and conflcit resolution. C. Terry Warner is a PhD in philosophy and taught for years at BYU so it is natural that the foundations of a lot of Arbinger (a company he founded) is centered around philosophy, theology, and psychology. The foundations of this book look at how understanding others and treating them like humans and not as objects helps us to find peace within, and by doing so leads to better understanding in families, businesses, and nations. It sounds a bit squishier than it is.Many of the models and even the setting used in this book are familiar to me. The book is set in Arizona (my home state) and is built around a fictional school, Camp Moriah (the book that seems roughly modeled on the Anasazi Foundation, a wilderness program for troubled youth). I should also add that I know the Warner family. I'm good friends with of of C. Terry's daughters and went to high school and university with several of his kids in Utah. He's the real deal, but I might also hold some proximity bias. But whatever bias I hold in favor towards C. Terry Warner should also be balanced by my usual contempt for this type of book. So, I guess it all balances out."}, {"userName": "K.S.R.", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/424383-k-s-r", "userReview": "The Arbinger Institute came out with a book to precede The Anatomy of Peace, called, Leadership and Self-Deception.

It made me re-think some aspects of my life and offers some very true advice. The diagrams are helpful for the visual learner.Unfortunately, the book is quite painful to read. It is one of those books that tries to teach concepts via a story. But in my experience, this delivery method comes across contrived and somewhat condescending. If I am going to read a self help book, I would rather have the information set forth in a clear, well-written way. Let's not try to make fiction out of non-fiction. Instead, you have to wade through all these stock characters having their own constant epiphanies. It is not believable and really boring. I would like to call for a revision. Find an author who can write, one who would actually be willing to claim the book (how does an institute write a book??), and try for non fiction self help. Then you might have something worth reading.

I really liked the concept that when we perceive others as being wrong, and ourselves as being right, we prevent ourselves from looking at different (and better or more effective) ways of approaching others. This book has made a difference for good in one of my relationships, and I am grateful for that.Beyond that, the book is corny. The setting for teaching is a Wilderness Camp for troubled teens. It is owned and operated by a Jew and Muslim who have found the keys to peaceful living and interaction. When parents come and drop their teens off to get their heads and their acts together, the parents also have a two day emotional issues boot camp, learning how things that they think and do may be as much a part of the problem as the various illegal and destructive things their teens are doing. The ideas are useful, but the method of teaching feels completely artificial. I like self-help books that just lay out the plan, rather than using some silly narrative style to show me \"Here is what you should be thinking and feeling at this point.\""}, {"userName": "Bilal Y.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4140090-bilal-y", "userReview": "Bu kitab\u0131n sizi \u015fa\u015f\u0131rtacak, \u015fok edecek bir \u00e7al\u0131\u015fma oldu\u011funu s\u00f6ylemeyece\u011fim ama sizin kendinize d\u00f6nmenizi sa\u011flayacak bir \u00e7al\u0131\u015fma oldu\u011fundan eminim.

On one hand, I appreciated the narrative style of presenting self-help information. I often get bored reading non-fiction, so this was appreciated despite the very contrived feel of the story line. On the other, it was contrived, and like other reviewers have mentioned, the insights into Lou's mind were hit-or-miss on helpfulness. Also, if I'd known before I read it that the Arbinger Institute was Mormon-run, I may have skipped it entirely. In my experience, the self-help books written by Mormons have a strange detachment from reality. I actually did get that sense throughout the book, however helpful it ended up being. Several of the ideas in the book deserve some consideration, however. The first of these is that self-betrayal (denying our inner sense of right and wrong--and a lifetime of it!) is the cause of our deep-seated unhappiness and therefore why our hearts are at war with ourselves and others. If we have little moral compass, how can we feel at peace with ourselves, or treat others well?The next idea is the \"boxes\" of unhappiness we carry around with us because of this self-betrayal; those boxes are labeled \"I-deserve,\" \"better-than,\" \"worse-than,\" and \"need-to-be-seen-as.\" Each of us carry around some level of all of these, usually--and often more of one than another. Being able to recognize when we are experiencing the emotions that go along with these boxes is our first step toward reclaiming a \"heart of peace\" rather than a \"heart of war.\" These emotions include (depending on the box you are carrying): impatience, disdain, superiority, entitlement, deprivation, resentment, helplessness, bitterness, depression, anxiety/fear, neediness/stress, and being overwhelmed. When we realize we are feeling these ways, we can then start looking for the ways we are seeing/treating others as objects (obstacles, problems, faceless people) rather than as people with their own needs, desires, and struggles. \"Seeing an equal person as an inferior object is an act of violence. It hurts as much as a punch to the face. In fact, in many ways it hurts more. Bruises heal more quickly than emotional scars do\" (Arbinger, 34). When we realize we've been treating others badly because we rationalize their treatment based on how we feel and our need to justify poor choices, we need to find a place (physically or in our minds) where we can remember or feel what it's like to be out of the box; a time when we felt loved, accepted, and happy. From that place, looking at our wars, we can determine ways to change our behavior to a behavior of peace toward others rather than the pattern of war we have been perpetuating. The main idea, obviously, is that change needs to come from within us. This does not mean allowing others to abuse us, or treat us like a door-mat, this is simply a way to do war, if necessary, or stop the war, with a heart of peace so we can feel whole. This is a program for ourselves: to stop the hate we feel, to stop the resentment, and the feeling of being a victim. Everything is within our power, no matter our circumstances and history. We can choose happiness and peace and emotional wholeness. I think overall, despite it's flawed presentation, this book has some great ideas to implement in ourselves and our interpersonal relationships. While it didn't specifically address how to interact with someone who is contentious, or how to avoid contentious situations, it will certainly help me prevent myself from feeling that contention in my heart when it does happen. It will help me keep the perspective of the other person as an equal human being rather than a problem to address. It will help keep the poison from my soul and draw out any poison that is there, over time. I was looking for something else when I picked up this book and ended up finding something else I needed more right now."}, {"userName": "Steve Hemmeke", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2561048-steve-hemmeke", "userReview": "If you are in a relationship of long-term conflict, read \"The Anatomy of Peace.\" The main purpose of this book is to get the reader who is in conflict to reflect upon his own contributions to the conflict. Since our natural tendency is to blame the one we're fighting, we need to reconsider that our posture toward the situation and our \"enemy\" is a major factor. The longer we are in conflict, the more strongly we deny this, but it remains true.We tend to objectify people instead of be at peace with them as people in relationship. We see ourselves as better (or worse) than them, or we have to be seen by them a certain way, or think we deserve better.Instead, we need to apologize for what we can, sacrifice for our enemy out of empathy with them, give them space to thrive, and continue considering them from a perspective of peace.The book does an especially good job dealing with skeptics, in the character of Lou, who assume this approach means compromising the truth or capitulating an important position. Being at peace with a person is different than giving them whatever they want. We don't have to be at war with people to maintain the truth or accomplish our goals."}, {"userName": "Sunny", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5870882-sunny", "userReview": "7 stars again! Another paradigm shifting book. This is the sequel to the leadership and self deception book which i recently finished and loved. While that was marginally business included but essentially about relationships this is almost totally about relationships but can also be applied to the business setting of course. This book gives you a governance structure with which you can go about fundamentally changing some of the most troublesome relationship in your life, at work or at home. One thing that i realised about the book was that it mentally gets you to put your brakes on on the direction that you are travelling in. imagine you are zipping through on the motorway and suddenly have to do a handbrake 180 turn and start going in the other direction, those initial skidding moments will be accompanied by a lot of noise and most of all friction and heat. I'm trying to apply the brakes and about turn in the way that i have been applying myself to certain relationships and its very very tough, especially at this nascent stage of the \u201cskid\u201d. The book gives you an incredible methodology that you can use to revolutionize your life and the onerous relationships you may have in them. I feel like buying (may do it) and handing out multiple copies of this book to lots of people that i know and care for because i'm sure it will have a huge impact on their lives. Here are the best bits:\u201cThe secret of salads success in the war yousef answered, was that his heart was at peace .\u201d\u201cIn every moment we are choosing to be either like Seledine or like the crusading invaders. In the way we regard as children are spouses neighbours colleagues and strangers, which used to see others either as people like ourselves or as objects.\u201d\u201cIn your conflicts with other people even if you are convinced you have been right in the positions you\u2019ve taken, can you say with confidence that you have also been right in your way of being towards them?\u201d\u201cSolution is possible only when at least one party begins to consider how you might be wrong. But what if I\u2019m not wrong Lou blurted out. Well if you are not wrong then you will be willing to consider how you might be mistaken.\u201d\u201cBeing in the world is what is most fundamental to human experience. He observed that there are basically two ways of being in the world: we can be in the world seeing others as people Or we can be in the world seeing others as objects. He called the first way of being there I-Thoul way and the second that I-it way and he argued that we are always in every moment being either I-thou or I-it.\u201d\u201cAs painful as it is to receive contempt from another it is more debilitating by far to be filled with content for another. In this too I speak from painful experience. My own contempt for others is the most debilitating pain of all for when I am in the middle of it when I\u2019m seeing resentfully and disdainfully I condemn myself to living in a disdained and resented world\u201d\u201cit is possible to find peace once more even when much of my life has been a war zone. Although nothing I can do in the present can take away the mistreatment of the past the way I carry myself in the present determines how I carryforward the memories of those mistreatment\u2019s. When I see others as objects I dwell on the injustices I have suffered in order to justify myself keeping my mistreatment and suffering alive with me.\u201d\u201cThis style of justification does not allow us to see others as people because we must see them prejudicially as less than we are, the less skilled perhaps or less important less knowledgeable less righteous and someone always less and therefore always objects.\u201d-Unfortunately I have thinking akin to this :(The book speaks about four boxes that anyone can often find themselves in unfortunately: the first box is called the better than box:In this box the view of yourself is superior important virtues right your view of others is inferior incapable irrelevant false/ wrong your own feelings are impatient disdainful indifferent. your view of the world is competitive trouble and needs me.The second box is called that I deserve box. In this box the view of yourself is meritorious mistreated victim and un appreciated. Your view of others is mistaken mistreating Ungrateful. Your feelings are entitled deprived resentful. Your view of the world is unfair unjust and owes me. The third box is called thr must be seen as box. The view of yourself is need to be well thought off. And fake. The view of others is judgemental threatening my audience. Your feelings are anxious afraid needy stressed and overwhelmed. Your view of the world is dangerous watching and judging me.The 4th box is called the worse than box. The view of yourself is not as good broken deficient fated. Your view of others is advantaged privileged and blessed. Your feelings are helpless jealous bitter depressed. Your view of the world is hard difficult against me ignoring me.\u201cWhile it is true we can\u2019t make others change, we can invite them to change.\u201dThe book also talks about an excellent peacemaking pyramid. It\u2019s got six layers to it. The foundational layer asks you to get out of your own box and to obtain a heart of peace. The second layer ask you to build relationships with others who have influence on the individual or group with which you have a challenge. The third layer ask you to build the relationship with that person. The fourth layer ask you to listen and learn from them. The fifth layer Asks you to teach and communicate with him. And ultimately the sixth layer is where you should work on correcting the issue in a cocreative way. Unfortunately people jump to that six layer and try to focus on what the corrections need to be without focusing on the five layers beneath that apex of the pyramid which is the correction itself. \u201cIf I\u2019m correcting and correcting but the problems remain that\u2019s the clue that the solution to the problem I\u2019m facing will not be found in further corrections.\u201dThe pyramid is based on three principles. Principal number one most the time and effort should be spent at the lower levels of the permit. Remember we want to spend most of our time in the levels of the pyramid below correction which is Exactly the opposite of what we normally do. Want to spend most of our time actively helping things go right rather than dealing with things that are going wrong.\u201c\u201cPrincipal number 2 the solution to a problem at one level of the pyramid it\u2019s always below that level of the pyramid.\u201dPrincipal number three. Ultimately my effectiveness at each level of the pyramid depends on the deepest level of the pyramid: my way of being.\u201cThe Pyramid keeps helping me to remember that I might be the problem in giving me hints of how I might begin to become part of the solution. A culture of change can never be created by behaviour strategy alone. Peace weather at home work or between peoples is invited only when intelligent outward strategy is married to a peaceful Inward one.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/797950-emily", "userReview": "If I could have, I would have given this book 3 1/2 stars. It was good, but it wasn't my favorite book ever. It wasn't even a book that I would go around recommending to everyone. I thought the message of the book was great. I liked the way they gave a good visual for the inner conflict of everyday choices. It was a great message to tell people who don't \"get it.\" However, halfway through the book, I was done. Firstly, I was done with the exhaustingly long train of thoughts that Lou goes through. Yeah, sure, he's the main character and we want to know what he's thinking, but do we have to know every single thought he thinks about minor comments? Do we have to go through all these flashbacks through his life every time a new concept is brought up? And it didn't help that most of the characters weren't exactly likeable. Even when their flaws were exposed, even when they realized where they were wrong, I still didn't care for them and I was glad I don't know them personally. The teachers, although they have deep, communicative stories about their own lives, didn't even seem like real people to me. Of course, all these things are petty annoyances and could easily be overlooked. The true reason I didn't consider this book to be the best self-help book ever was because it wasn't a solution. It didn't actually show you how to choose a heart of peace over a heart of war. It tried, but who is really going to ever stop dead in their tracks and go, \"oh yeah, heart at peace, gotta have a heart at peace\"? Maybe, if the ideas in this book were completely revolutionary to them, then they would. But for me, it wasn't a radical change of thinking, it was just a very orderly way of thinking what I was always taught to think. I found myself comparing this book with \"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People\" by Stephen Covey. The difference, to me, was that \"7 Habits\" had an actual formula of what to do, actual steps to take. \"Anatomy of Peace\" tried to accomplish that, and in my mind, failed. I definitely appreciated what this book was trying to convey, and I would recommend it to someone who desperately needed to turn their life around. But it just wasn't what I needed. Not that I'm perfect by any means, and I wouldn't be entirely truthful if I said that this book didn't help me some. It was a good reminder of the way I should be and the way I should be thinking. But I didn't feel like it totally changed my life, and I had this annoying feeling that the authors were waiting with baited breath for me to jump up and go, \"Whoa! Now I understand!\" ...Yeah, that didn't happen.

I have to admit that even though I love to read, I am never very excited to read a self-help book. I dislike introspecting and am not very good at it, so concepts that require examining my motives or my sub-conscious issues don\u2019t resonate with me at all. I find that trying to figure myself out is tiring, confusing, and, frankly, quite boring. Because of my prejudice against this particular genre, I approached reading The Anatomy of Peace with some slight trepidation. I was surprised to find that it was interesting and a fairly quick read. It isn't written in a textbook way, but instead tells a story, and the principles being taught unfold through the dialogue and actions of the characters. These principles go right along with my beliefs in the doctrines of Jesus Christ (the book is not religious) and the way that I am trying to be, anyway. Because I am more of an action person (application without introspection), I also liked the book because it gave concrete ideas on how to apply what it taught. The basic premise is that we always have a choice as to whether we treat others as objects or as people (based on the I-thou, I-it philosophy of Martin Buber). Our actions don't matter as much as our \"state of being\" that we feel when we perform them. We can be doing the \"right\" thing, but if our heart isn't at peace and seeing others as people, we will be creating conflict.

But we don't see much of what happens with the children. The book describes two days of seminars held with the parents, where the directors of the center try to help them understand how their own actions and reactions relate to the problems of their children.I don't often find myself dealing with the depth of conflict described here.

Developing the story and getting to the point was painstakingly slow and I would not have finished the book were it not for my nice bookclub. I didn't like being talked down to as if these concepts are so complex and difficult to understand. The concepts are not new and certainly not groundbreaking as the institute wants it to seem. It's the same simple concepts just worded differently and not very clearly or simply! \"in the box\" \"out of the box\" \"state of being\" \"justification\" \"collusion\" It is a confusing way of explaining cognitive therapy and the positive thinking books that have been around for years: you determine the state you are in by the thoughts you think and the way you view the world.

If it wasn't for audiobooks I would be reading far less because I am home far less. This bugs me so much that I intend to make sure I am not pulled in so many different directions in the near future. In my defense, a good bit of my not being at home has been because I am in having to travel to my parents frequently, something I enjoy doing and audiobooks help it to be even more enjoyable. Someday, I will not have to visit my parents anymore. So, I bought this on a whim and it is corny and the voice of the narrator is even cornier and then when I found out the main story in the book, in which an Arab and a Jew become friends, wasn't even true it kind of left me scratching my head. But is wasn't a total waste of time. We all need to be reminded to love our enemies. It is just the much shorter parables in the Bible cover that subject better in far less time.

You\u2019ll know it if you\u2019ve seen one: It\u2019s teachable moment after teachable moment piled on in dialogue after dialogue. Again excellent despite that. Mostly a reiteration and expansion of the previous book though this one draws out more of the stoicism implicit in the ideas here. The key idea is again something like: \u201cYou and everyone on the planet are going to feel a desire to treat people as persons and help them when they\u2019re in need. You're either going to honor that desire in your behaviors towards them \u2014 which may or may not help them \u2014 or betray that desire and dehumanize yourself and them. That won\u2019t work out well for either of you.\u201d There\u2019s no real argument or proof for the inciting incident (the instant and unconscious, or maybe even biological, desire to help) but it feels right enough.

I appreciate the telling in a story form, only because it helped to digest the information better. There is a wide variety of characters in this story, coming together in a situation where they end up in a discussion/help group to get to the root of their problem. That said, this book is much longer than I think it needed to be in order to state its intended goal: that we need to look at people as people, not objects. It is when we look at people as objects that we can more easily dwell on past injustices, which keeps these mistreatments alive in our spirits only to react negatively. When we see others as people, we don't have the necessity to justify ourselves. When our heart is at war, we see people as objects, starting this cycle. However, getting our hearts to peace will help us look at people differently, and cause us to interact differently. While this book was not a fit for me, it will probably be helpful for others who are struggling with relationship issues who need to learn something through its secular approach. However, while it may assist the reader to getting to the heart of the problem, I feel that it spends the majority of its pages toward identifying the problem and not giving the reader enough tools for solving issues."}, {"userName": "Greg Frucci", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9849177-greg-frucci", "userReview": "A friend gave me a copy of \"The Anatomy of Peace\" recently and I just finished it...could not put it down once I started.

For me, this is what the message of this book boiled down to. The basic idea that is proposed is that we create rationalizations for why we think we can treat people like objects. The bulk of the book is spent helping the characters identify what is causing strain in their relationships, and then simple solutions are offered. There were some things I loved, and some that I disliked about the way this book was written -- I loved it because it was very simple and straight-forward; the message gets across through the plot line of the story, and is even reinforced with charts and diagrams. I disliked some of the dialogue -- it was cringe-worthily cheesy. But, I think it was done in an effort to make the message clear and to leave nothing unsaid; the basic principles of the book are laid out very clearly.Make sure you give yourself enough time to read this. I read it once slowly and recognize I need to read it over and over to apply the principles. It's not a book you can read casually and expect to get the intended effect out of it.

It is the best book I have read this year.The Arbinger Institute has now written two books. The first was quite good. When I started this book I was afraid it was just going to be a re-hashing of that book: \u201cLeadership and Self-Deception.\u201d What I found fascinating is that IT IS the same material; they cover the same topics and teach the same lessons. But they do it so well, and teach it with such REAL LIFE examples, that I couldn\u2019t stop reading the book. I was only supposed to read 65 pages before our book club meeting \u2013 I read all 224. It really is that good, that helpful.The book starts with a bunch of parents all arriving at a \u201creformation camp\u201d for wayward kids. This is for those parents who have already tried everything else because their kid is on drugs, in jail, failing school, violent, belligerent, etc\u2026The parents are asked not only to bring their children to the camp, but stay themselves for a few days. The parents have to spend two days being taught by the two men who run the camp: Yusuf al-Falah, an Arab; and Avi Rozen, a Jew. The book covers the two days with the parents, hearing their stories, and being taught by two men who should be the most bitter of enemies, but have found a way to make peace.I know it might sound cheesy, and yes the story is kind of a lecture \u2013 but trust me, it\u2019s worth it.Here are a few Reviews of the book by people more well known.Here are my favorite quotations from the book:Lumping everyone of a particular race or culture or faith into a single stereotype is a way of failing to see them as people. \u2013 p. 29When we start seeing others as objects we begin provoking them to make our lives difficult. We actually start inviting others to make us miserable. \u2013 p. 43We provoke in others the very comments and behaviors we are accusing them of. \u2013 p. 49Another characteristic of conflicts\u2026is the propensity to demonize others. One way we do this is by lumping others into lifeless categories \u2013 bigoted whites, lazy blacks, crass Americans, arrogant Europeans, violent Arabs, manipulative Jews, and so on. When we do this we make masses of unknown people into objects and many of them into our enemies. \u2013 p. 54The deepest way in which we are right or wrong is in our way of being toward others. \u2013 p. 57If we can\u2019t put an end to the violence within us, there is no hope of putting an end to the violence without. \u2013 p. 64Sometimes we might be forced to defend ourselves\u2026but that is different than saying that we are forced to despise, to rage, to denigrate, to belittle. \u2013 p. 80Self Betrayal. It is a betrayal of my own sense of the right way to act in a given moment in time \u2013 not someone else\u2019s sense or standard, but what I myself feel is right in the moment. \u2013 p. 90A choice to betray myself is a choice to go to war. \u2013 p. 91I needed to be justified for violating the truth I knew in that moment. \u2013 p. 94What need would I have to be justified if I wasn\u2019t somehow crooked? \u2013 p. 95If I am worried that others are getting a pass, am I also worried about whether I am giving myself one? \u2013 p. 95Whenever we need to be justified, anything that will give us justification will immediately take on exaggerated importance in our life. \u2013 p. 106I can notice people\u2019s relative strengths and weaknesses when I\u2019m seeing them as people. What\u2019s different when I\u2019m in the box however, is that I feel superior to or better than others because of these strengths or weaknesses\u2026I\u2019m doing more than simply noticing differences; I\u2019m making judgments about peoples\u2019 worth based on those differences. \u2013 p. 108If I need to be seen as smart...I will get anxious whenever I think my intelligence might be at issue. \u2013 p. 132Think of the privileges we may retain for ourselves while we apply other standards to those who work for is \u2013 privileges regarding vacation time, for example, the choice parking spot, the special perks, the public spotlight, the differences between what we have to do to get something to happen and what everyone else in our organization has to do. Which of these are necessary or unavoidable, and which of them do we retain because we think we are better than others, more vital, and deserve special treatment? \u2013 p. 158What\u2019s more important to you now \u2013 flaunting your well-earned important status or building a team and organization that will outlive you, surpass you, grow beyond you, and ultimately thank and revere you? \u2013 p. 160Try thinking about the people who have had the greatest influence for good in your life and why? \u2013 p. 175 Simply the memory of those people can take you to a different vantage point. \u2013 p. 175 Or maybe there is a particular book or book passage that has a powerful effect on you. \u2013 p. 175You need only to identify the relationships, places, memories, activities, book passages, and so on, that have that kind of power for you, and then remember to search them out when you feel war rising within you. \u2013 p. 177Most people who are trying to put an end to injustice only think of the injustices they themselves have suffered. Which means they are not really concerned with injustice but with themselves. They hide their focus on themselves behind the righteousness of their outward cause. \u2013 p. 186\u00b7What are this person\u2019s or people\u2019s challenges, trials, burdens, and pains?\u00b7How am I, or some group of which I am a part, adding to these challenges, trials, burdens, and pains?\u00b7In what other ways have I or my group neglected or mistreated this person or group?\u00b7In what are my better-than, I-deserve, worse-than, and must-be-seen-as boxes obscuring the truth about others and myself and interfering with potential solutions?\u00b7What am I feeling I should do for this person or group? What could I do to help?We need to honor the senses we have rather than betray them. \u2013 p. 196It is no good trying to teach if I myself am not listening and learning. \u2013 p. 205We want to spend most of our time actively helping things go right. \u2013 p. 214When our teaching is going poorly, we often try to rescue it by talking more and insisting more\u2026If I am correcting and correcting but problems remain, that is a clue that the solution to the problem I am facing will not be found in further correction. \u2013 p. 215"}, {"userName": "Mehrsa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1045774-mehrsa", "userReview": "Like I said in my review of the other Arbinger book (Leadership and self-deception), I love these ideas and hate the delivery.

The other problem is that they assume it's a HE. In all of them, the principle character is a dude and the women's \"boxes\" are also examined but as a sidebar. The ideas are certainly not gendered--they are universal and I've been trying to live my life based on these principles. But I find myself trying to learn despite of and not thanks to the writing and delivery. It's frustrating. If you talk directly to the reader, you can avoid these problems.
