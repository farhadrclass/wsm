Lex Devlin is a legendary attorney whose career was nearly ruined by rumor that he bought a juror. Now the two are working together to defend, and prove innocent, the son of an important Judge. The young man is accused of shooting a revered elderly man in Chinatown. In the investigation, Michael, with his college friend Harry, sees sides of Chinatown he didn\u2019t know existed and he may not survive the experience.*** Gripping, exciting, suspenseful\u2014over the top at times but boy, did it keep me turning the pages. There was good development of the main characters, wonderful wry humor and a chance to visit my favorite city of Boston and the drive to Canada. I can\u2019t ensure the accuracy of the legal scenes, but considering Dobbyn was a practicing lawyer and now a professor of law, I have to assume they are correct. They certainly aren\u2019t dull, as is nothing in this book. If you are looking for an exciting weekend read, this is it. I\u2019ll also admit I also loved that his inside cover picture is him, his wife and their dog."}, {"userName": "Patricia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/985726-patricia", "userReview": "Michael Knight is a young lawyer in a large firm arguing a motion before Judge Amos Bradley. Rumor has it that Judge Bradley is destined to be the next African American justice on the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. When Judge Bradley calls Knight into his chambers and announces that he wants Knight to defend his son in a criminal matter, Knight is shocked. He is even more shocked to discover the criminal matter is a murder charge.A senior partner in Knight\u2019s firm is Lex Devlin. Once one of the foremost criminal defense attorneys in Boston, Devlin has withdrawn from defense work in recent years. Judge Bradley is hoping that Devlin can assist Knight in the defense. Devlin was once accused of jury tampering although it was never proven. This is the reason that Devlin quit handling criminal defense.Judge Bradley\u2019s son is accused of murdering an old man during a Chinatown New Year Celebration. Knight goes into Chinatown undercover with the help of his friend Harry Wong. Knight\u2019s goal is not only to uncover what really happened the night of the shooting but also to prove that Devlin was not guilty of jury tampering.The story that is revealed is an interesting one and Knight\u2019s methods for obtaining information are even more interesting. Neon Dragon gives the reader a lot of insight into criminal activities in the Chinese community."}, {"userName": "LadyCalico", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2288360-ladycalico", "userReview": "Sometimes I think I am way too critical. Sometimes I go back and edit my reviews to be more kindly thinking maybe it's just me; maybe I was just in a mood; maybe this just isn't my genre; maybe that prose wasn't as bad as picky old me thought it was. Then I read a book like this one and see how a really good author can write and know that my less favorable critiques on less skilled wordsmiths were more than justified. Now, this is good writing. Okay I'm prejudiced--from the first paragraph onward. I thought that was one of the best opening paragraphs ever. The opener pulled me in and warmed me up to be fully prepared to enjoy the rest of this tale. The story itself had many implausibilities that normally would bother the bejeebers out of me (okay, Harry refusing a cab ride and insisting on walking to the subway knowing he was in danger and Michael letting him without trying to intercept him, even after seeing the footprints in the snow--that still bothers me)--but the writing, flow, and characters were so delightfully rich--I didn't care. I just sucked it all in and savored it."}, {"userName": "Carla Cano", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19581383-carla-cano", "userReview": "Michael Knight is asked to represent a judges son in a homicide defense. He is up against a Chinese tong, while at the same time trying to right a wrong against one of the lead attorneys in the firm. Michael Knight is a likable character. His background wasn't really explored enough before being plunged into this case. He seemed to encounter great obstacles and his compassion for everyone involved was a bit overdone. The story was a page turner, full of action and suspense. It even had a beginning of a romance or two. This is the first in a partnership between Michael Knight and Lex Devlin, the lead attorney. Knight's fierce desire to clear Devlin's name from a scandal that happened 10 years ago seemed a bit contrived. He met him only a handful of times. While much of the obstacles and the way Knight handles them seemed unbelievable for me, I enjoyed the pace of the book. I enjoyed the hope that Knight was successful and was able to accomplish everything he set out to do while still maintaining his impeccable character."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7878599-tim", "userReview": "Great crime novel! Michael Knight is a young associate arguing motions for partners when a judge asks him to represent his son on a murder charge. This case takes him to the seedy underside of Boston's Chinatown as he investigates his client's claim that he didn't pull the trigger. It also takes him into the office of Lex Devlin, a partner in the law firm and a lawyer with a reputation of being a fierce criminal defense attorney.I really liked the characters of Mike Knight and Lex Devlin. They were deeply written and very human. Even the side characters were well thought out and more complete than those from other writers. The plot was engaging and well paced with enough twists and hidden ends to make it a very enjoyable read.This is the first Devlin/Knight books. I will definitely be looking for others.

The author did an amazing job of developing each character. I felt as if I knew each person and what motivated him/her. The descriptive locations the author provided actually made me feel like I was there with the characters. From the club where Michael played on stage to the dingy brothel in Chinatown. Also, the hero had a dry sense of humor and a witty perspective that I quickly came to appreciate. This style of writing, complete with wonderful similies and creative metaphors reminded me of the many great classic novels I read in high school. Excellent writing, an unpredictable story line, and a well-fleshed out plot kept me engrossed from beginning to end. Needless to say, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I'm a John Dobbyn fan for life!"}, {"userName": "Nick McGreggor", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5503136-nick-mcgreggor", "userReview": "Some wildly improbable stuff happens in this book.
