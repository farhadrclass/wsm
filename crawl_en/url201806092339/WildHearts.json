The guy: Paris CockburnYeah, that's his name. Anyway, when his father dies, he learns that the old man has been paying an orphanage for the care of a young girl. He goes to see the chit and instantly realizes she\u2019s a Cockburn too\u2014and that the mistress of the orphanage is an abusive old bat who ill-treats the children. He makes promises to the girl that he\u2019ll help her find her family, and threatens the old bat that she had better treat the girl well. Then he walks away and forgets it all\u2014well, until he learns the girl is betrothed. It seems some rich-as-Croesus old lord has the pox and wants \u201cthe virgin cure.\u201d Paris has an idea\u2014he\u2019ll let the wedding happen, then abduct the bride for ransom before the consummation, and get a buttload of gold for her. It seems at first he\u2019s willing to let her go back to the poxy lord once he gets his dough, but the chit makes him feel all hot and naughty, so he decides he won't let her go. Keep in mind, there are but two likely candidates as to the identity of the girl\u2019s father, and one of them was Paris's father. So he at least suspects the girl could be his sister, but that doesn\u2019t stop him from deciding to shag her, because what\u2019s a little incest between friends? Paris\u2019s idea of seduction is to kick a gal around like a dried-up dog turd, make fun of her when she gets upset, and then he\u2019s outraged she isn\u2019t thrilled by his attentions. So, of course, he rapes her (while STILL thinking she might be his sister, mind you). The gal: Tabby (Tabrizia\u2014evidently the Cockburns like to name their kids after cities) was abused as an orphan, so she\u2019s thoroughly intimidated by Paris when he bullies her. And when he isn't bullying he humiliates her and deceives her (for one thing, he\u2019s married too\u2014guess it\u2019s OK to try to seduce Tabby without mentioning that small fact, since even if he were single he couldn\u2019t actually MARRY his sister anyway). What a guy. And of course she can't resist him.Paris decides to make her love him. Which he goes about by kicking her around some more and humiliating her some more\u2014let\u2019s just say the guy has very little to contribute to the human gene pool. But, well, maybe Tabby\u2019s a bit \u201coff\u201d as well, since after one particularly cruel remark, she\u2019s so furious she\u2026picks up his wet clothes and lays them out before the fire to dry. Meanwhile, after raping a girl he suspects is his sister, Paris is enough of a hypocrite to beat the snot out of his brother based on a suspicion of incest. OK, so the hero is a jerk. Nothing new for this genre. And there has to be something about bodice rippers that I like, since I do keep reading them. Maybe it\u2019s just that, once in a GREAT while, a writer actually manages to create an alpha-a-hole BR hero who eventually pulls his head out of his ass, regrets the hurt he\u2019s caused, and actually starts treating his woman like he cares for her\u2014and when that happens, it\u2019s usually a damned good story. Unfortunately, too often, the \u201chero\u201d is a thorough pissant to the very last page. Without giving anything away, in this case, I was pretty well satisfied by the ending, tho some of the reforms were almost queasy-making in their own way. One unfortunate thing\u2014to be fair, this is only Henley\u2019s third book, and it was written in the 80\u2019s when what we think of today as \u201cbad\u201d writing was its own kind of fashion, but even so, my critique group would\u2019ve made a meal of this book (and I say this with all humility because the main reason I\u2019m so sensitive to exposition, adverb abuse, and \u201csaidisms\u201d is because I\u2019ve been harangued to near madness by my crit group for doing it!). Anyway, I\u2019ll just say I\u2019ve read some of Henley\u2019s more recent books and the quality of her writing today is considerably better."}, {"userName": "Carol Storm", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032322-carol-storm", "userReview": "Wildly sexy book -- even better if you can find it on audio!"}, {"userName": "Regan Walker", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7363897-regan-walker", "userReview": "I love Virginia Henley's work, but this one disappointed. If one considers it is an early work by this Master of Historical Romance, it becomes clearer why it's a Scottish tale that isn\u2019t believable in places.Originally published in 1985, this was Henley\u2019s third book. Her style and writing has improved so much since, you have to see this as an early work though the eBook was published in 2011.As the story opens, we are in Scotland at the time King James began to rule over both England and Scotland in 1603. Scottish Border Lord Paris Cockburn\u2019s father died in a fall, leaving him laird of clan and castle. Paris is married but his wife never leaves her room. As Paris, called \u201cthe Rogue\u201d by his friends, is looking over the books his father kept, he finds annual payments to an Edinburgh orphanage for Tabby Lamont. He knows his father brought her to the orphanage 10 years before, but he doesn\u2019t know why, so he goes to see the 14-year-old girl, and decides to try and help her. All he does is cause her more beatings. (One had to hate him for leaving her there, particularly since he thought she was related to him). Two years later, Tabby is given in marriage (by the horrid woman who ran the orphanage) to a wealthy moneylender (a pox ridden pedophile who favors young boys). Before the marriage is consummated, however, Paris kidnaps her, hoping to hold her for ransom. (Our \u201chero\u201d was looking worse all the time\u2026holding his kin for ransom by a lecherous old man??) My biggest issue with this novel was not the dialog, the failure of it to seem Scottish in many places (only King Jamie has a Scottish accent), nor the clich\u00e9s. It was the story. Though it captured my attention when the scene turned to London, and I liked the ending very much, the \u201chero\u201d continued to be a bad apple through most of the story. He didn\u2019t even care Tabby might love another. A selfish, demanding cad. The best guy, to my thinking, was Patrick Stewart. He was both a gentleman and a leader, and given his status, a worthy man for our heroine. And that leads me to one of those \u201cimprobable events.\u201d I didn\u2019t believe he could be bought off. No, he wanted her for himself. Even if money had been his goal, marrying her would have gained him far more. It should have made no sense to Tabby that Paris would want her, especially when he told her he intended to seek his pleasure with other women. He didn\u2019t even think to wed her until he saw Alexandria\u2019s note. Tabby had to be stupid not to wonder about his motives\u2026and agreeing to act the loving wife in front of his family just made her look weak. Then, after he rapes her she waits on him hand and foot? Yuck! I wanted her to have some backbone\u2026but no\u2026 And that is why, though I loved it in parts, this one only garnered 3 and \u00bd stars from me."}, {"userName": "Melissa", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1658251-melissa", "userReview": "Historical romance. Set in the time of James I in the Scottish Highlands. I like her books."}, {"userName": "Alanna Jenkins", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8706127-alanna-jenkins", "userReview": "Wild Hearts is about Tabby Lamont, who has grown up in an Edinburgh orphanage in the reign of King James. She is rescued from the orphanage by a wealthy older gentleman who pays for her hand in marriage. She thinks herself incredibly lucky and is looking forward to a life of luxury, until she is kidnapped on her wedding night by her benefactor in the orphanage, Paris \u2018Rogue\u2019 Cockburn. Paris has heard of her upcoming nuptials and is desperate to protect her from the man who has bought her hand in marriage purely to rid himself of a disease that he has been told can only be cured by virgin\u2019s blood. Paris takes Tabby back to his home on the Borders and demands a ransom of \u00a320,000 for her safe return \u2013 something which he never intends to deliver on, as he wants her for himself. The story develops into a series of misunderstandings and attempted escapes on Tabby\u2019s part, including an impatient husband, several suitors and the knowledge that Paris is aware of Tabby\u2019s parentage, as they both realise that they are falling for each other with neither wanting to yield.Tabby made for a great heroine throughout, with a keen sense of duty and defiance showing through from the start of the novel. She is a vulnerable character, with naivety in spades, and is generally very gentle and meek in her approach, despite her underlying fire. As she spends more time with the Cockburn clan, we get to see her develop her courage and start to bite back when teased. That, married with the experiences that are thrust upon her throughout the novel, mean that we start to see a much more determined and selfish individual \u2013 someone who takes care of herself at any cost, to the point of being blinded by her stubbornness to let anyone in. It was great to see both extremes to Tabby throughout the book, and the happy medium she finds in the end was a very fitting end; her age of 17 (for most of the story) made her changes feel very natural, as she was clearly a young woman trying to find herself.Paris initially came across as quite an intimidating character, and I wasn\u2019t sure if I was going to like him; I wasn\u2019t completely behind his success in his relationship with Tabby to begin with, and found myself hoping at times that the author saw fit to have her end up with one of her other suitors. However, his loving approach to his large family, and the insight I got into his true feelings for Tabby as the book developed slowly softened my approach to him; by the middle of the book, I was willing him to find a way to succeed with Tabby. His brutish-ness remained throughout the novel, but became less intimidating and less frequent as the story wore on; in the end, I came to understand that his temper was a representation of how protective he felt over those he loved.The coupling of these two characters was brilliant, their relationship was fascinating to read about as it developed. There were so many twists and turns in their dealings with each other, that I couldn\u2019t be entirely sure how the author intended to reach a conclusion until near the end of the book (even with a last minute twist in the last two chapters) \u2013 something that\u2019s rare when you\u2019re reading a historical romance (while almost always thorougly enjoyable, they tend to be fairly predictable in overall plot). Both characters had fantastic qualities and a brilliant temper that drove the other to the point of insanity. The talent behind writing these characters is that I felt the frustrations and love that they felt for each other as I was reading; I love it when a book has that effect on me, and it made for a book that I couldn\u2019t put down!The surrounding characters were given a fair amount of development as well, and it made the story much more interesting than if it has just been left as a romance between Tabby and Paris. Paris\u2019s family were the most entertaining support characters for me; 4 sisters and 2 brothers, each with their own tale of woe and romance that was explored throughout the novel. Each sibling was named after a European city, which I thought was a lovely little side note to the plot-line. Troy, the next eldest, was shown to be a cheeky, charming character with talents for raiding and chasing women; he didn\u2019t really get as much exploration as the other siblings, but given that Paris was such a dominating character, it wouldn\u2019t have made sense to have another so close in age to him get too much airtime. Damascus, the eldest sister, was shown to be quite vain and in desperate want of being the first of her sisters to marry; she has a suitor in mind, but is scared of getting Paris\u2019 permission to marry. Shannon, the elder middle sister, was portrayed as a frivolous character with a good heart; she starts the novel engaged in regular dalliances with a local gypsy and ends up meeting her match (in temperament and passion) in one of Paris\u2019 friends. Venetia, like Troy, didn\u2019t really receive much exploration as a character, and was fairly swiftly given her happy ending \u2013 married with a child on the way to her chosen suitor. The youngest siblings, twins Alexander and Alexandria, turned out to be more important to the plot than originally thought, with both getting caught up in Tabby and Paris\u2019 messy relationship with irrevocable consequences. They were constantly helping each other out of scrapes and taking on each other\u2019s hobbies for appearances sake (Alexander is actually fairly effiminate and Alexandria is a tomboy). Outside of the immediate family, Henley also gave great care to the villains of the story \u2013 Tabby\u2019s husband, Paris\u2019 ailing wife and Uncle Magnus\u2019 mistress were all fascinating and drew me into the story even further.The book was initially a slow burner for me, and I wasn\u2019t sure I was going to be able to get into it, but I was very mistaken; by the time I had got a third of the way through, I was hooked, desperately reading into the small hours of the morning to find out what happened to Tabby and Paris. Henley wrote very well, holding my attention and making me want to know more about ALL of the characters she was writing about. The plot was full of intriguing misunderstandings and mishaps, meaning that I never got bored \u2013 there was constantly something new for me to discover as a reader. The fact that Henley took the time to develop her world so completely actually turned out to be a blessing, as I don\u2019t think I would have enjoyed the book nearly as much as I did had she not made the considerable effort to make things seem real and whole; I found myself engrossed in what was going on beyond all comprehension of time and surroundings. In the end, I found that I was quite sad when the book came to an end, because I had immersed myself in the world of the Cockburn clan so completely that I felt I needed to read more. I will definitely be reading more of Virginia Henley\u2018s work, and that book has fast become one of my favourites."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8261784-jill", "userReview": "An orphan with a mysterious background is sold off to a man with bad intentions, then kidnapped for ransom by another man, who is none too honorable himself.
