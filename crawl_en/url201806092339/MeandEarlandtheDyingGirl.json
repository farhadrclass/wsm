They're so hung up on leaving the reader with a beautiful message about life and/or death, so intent on making you cry and showing how a person can gain a new outlook or fall in love from being close to someone with a terminal illness. In real life, very few people are lucky enough to take something amazing away from an experience like that. Andrews knows it, and he does such a great job of delivering a book that is hilarious with colourful characters, that contains a girl with cancer, but doesn't strain itself to give us a life lesson.\n\u201cLook, I was an idiot. I didn't want people to think that I had a crush, so I decided to give everyone the impression that I truly, honestly hated Madison Harter. For no reason. Just thinking about this makes me want to punch myself in the eyeball.\u201d \nOne of the best things about this book is that the illness is a subplot in an otherwise really funny novel. This is the most I've laughed at a story in a very long time. Greg is a fantastic protagonist and the jokes vary between witty sarcasm and a bit of ridiculous schoolboy humour - who knew breasts could be such a source of hilarity? And the even better thing is that Andrews doesn't try to manipulate the reader's emotions, I didn't feel like I was being forced to cry or pity Rachel, and I appreciated the author's message that sometimes shit happens, things go wrong and people die, and we don't necessarily learn anything useful from it, other than the fact that shit happens, things go wrong and people die.Greg feels like he should be moved by Rachel's illness, he feels like he should hang out with her, and yet Andrews allows him to acknowledge that he isn't moved, he doesn't really want to help out or get involved, in fact he finds himself wishing he could ignore the whole situation, carry on with his life, and pretend it isn't happening. Maybe you won't like this sentiment, but it felt a million times more honest and real than any other book about illness that I can remember.I think that what I like about Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is what's lacking in Green's work. Andrews' characters are not life lessons, not philosophers, not poets, they're just kids in the worst kind of situation. And they're also incredibly funny.If you're looking for a honest and hilarious story with a great cast of characters, I'm pretty confident Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is for you.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Youtube"}, {"userName": "Jesse Andrews", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/81802-jesse-andrews", "userReview": "this is probably the best debut novel i have ever written."}, {"userName": "Kat O'Keeffe", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4672379-kat-o-keeffe", "userReview": "This book was HILARIOUS.

It seems to me like one of those cult books where if you love it, you love it, but if you don't, you don't. There were parts of it that were funny, but the majority of the parts that I felt were meant to be funny just fell flat. The cover is absolutely beautiful and there were some parts that I definitely enjoyed\u2026 but, it just didn't do it for me. This book is about Greg and Earl and Rachel. Greg is a high school senior and he and Earl are amateur film makers (spoiler alert: They're not very good.) Rachel is Greg's old kind of girlfriend who recently became diagnosed with leukemia and is dying. There were some parts of this book were laugh-out-loud funny, but the non-funny bits and the kind of useless annoying bits made it a one star for me.SPOILER DISCUSSIONCan I just talk about how much I hated all the \"this is such a bad book I don't even know why I'm writing this I'm going to throw the laptop if you're enjoying this you should punch your own eye\" parts. Why? I don't know if it was kind of supposed to be funny and enjoyable and like, \"haha, he's making fun of himself\" but it came across like those people who are always talking about how ugly they are and you just want them to shut up!Let's just spend a second talking about this cover. So gorgeous. I'm so in love with it. All the art was amazing, it was just the story\u2026\u00a0blah.I liked all the alternate ways of telling the stories. Bullet points and script format and all of that. Probably my favorite part of the whole rading experience.I honestly didn't care about the characters at all. And I think that's the issue, even when Rachel died I was like, \"eh, what a shame.\" Greg seemed like a total jerk, I could get used to Earl in a way and I actually enjoyed his character, but it was just odd.Another thing about this book, it felt like it was trying so hard to be eccentric and different. Like how there were all the dorky goth kids and Mr. Mcarthy and all of Earl's brothers. Not everyone is eccentric like that. For a lot of people, you have to get to know them and then you figure out all their little quirks. There is no place that I'm aware of where you can have teachers who are shoeless in class and kids who beat up on each other randomly and a girl dying of cancer and a kid so unable to feel things and only able to beat up on himself but who likes to make films anyway so his future self can just talk about how much they suck some more. That is just too much in my opinion. There have to be some \"normal\" people.I liked some of the plot, but so much of it was tangents and they didn't really make sense to me and we didn't really get to know any of the characters (I'm sure there was some deep stuff going on that I just didn't catch onto, and really we know that Earl has spent so much time trying to help his mother and all that,) but it just isn't anywhere near enough for me.END!Somewhat amusing, not at all sad, weird book: 53%"}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "It\u2019s rare for me not to know what to say about a book. And I guess I do know what to say about this one, but my thoughts are very different from other people, so just keep in mind that we all perceive things, characters, scenes, etc. differently.Greg is a liar.A big, fat liar, he would correct me.From the beginning, he is lying to us. He says that his meeting Rachel who suffers from leukemia didn\u2019t change anything inside him. He says he didn\u2019t learn anything from this experience he lived and that in no way has it changed his way of looking at things \u2013 cancer, death, friendship, life, etc.He even says it: I learned absolutely nothing from Rachel\u2019s leukemia. But those are lies. He\u2019s so in denial it made me furious.He\u2019s not in touch with his emotions. He\u2019s the type of person who wants to steer clear of altercations at all cost. To make his life simpler, he even decides to befriend everyone at school, without really befriending them, so he could steer clear of any drama befalling him, too.Now I liked him. I really did. I thought he was adorably goofy and awkward. He doesn\u2019t share my type of humour, but that doesn\u2019t mean I didn\u2019t find this book entertaining.It is. I was always a huge fan of \u2018\u2018special novels\u2019\u2019 I like to call them. The ones that defy the idea of what a novel should consist of. The ones that aren\u2019t always written in paragraphs and very often use book-related props: letters, bullet points, various fonts, etc.I liked its original narration and Greg himself. Though I couldn\u2019t agree with him all the time and I still don\u2019t, he\u2019s a kid a small part of me could connect with.The part that doesn\u2019t know where it belongs in this life. What to study? What school to choose? Where to go and what to do? He and I are very different people and we probably would never be friends, but I can say that he\u2019s a good kid.Most of the dialogs make sense \u2013 thank god \u2013 and the humour in form of figures of speech is not hard to decrypt and even the writing is somewhat enjoyable.BUT THE PLOT, or rather the lack of it, may get on your nerves. The book is fairly fast-paced and interestingly put together (with all of them book-related props) to not lose interest in it, but it does leave the reader thinking, \u2018\u2018Is that it, motherfucker?\u2019\u2019Yup, that\u2019s it.I wish you all the best, Greg.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"userName": "Whitney Atkinson", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14457130-whitney-atkinson", "userReview": "a lot of people are commenting on this so i just wanted to add really quick loli read this book like 2 years ago but i was going through my 'read' list and noticed i gave this four stars which was weird because this book was shit so that's that"}, {"userName": "Caitlyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6322902-caitlyn", "userReview": "Uhm. I didn't like one single part of this book. The humor was absolutely atrocious to me. I've heard people were constantly laughing throughout this book but my sense of humor is the exact opposite of this. I didn't crack a smile, if anything, I emitted loud sighs amid an almost constant stream of guffaws at the audacity of the book. The characters were either a) completely annoying or b) flat and therefore forgettable. Greg's narrating got on my nerves after about approximately five pages. His constant stream of annoying interjections, self deprecation, awful jokes, and crude humor did nothing for me. The way that the Earl was portrayed was incredibly stereotypical. Not only was his family given awful qualities, lives, and bad habits but it was stated again and again how he did drugs at a young age, how he smoked cigarettes carelessly, and how he spoke grammatically incorrect all the time. Then we have Rachel. Her character was so underdeveloped that she completely faded into the background. The only thing we truly learn about her is her cancer and her Hugh Jackman posters. I couldn't connect with any of them and to be quite frank, I didn't even want to. In short, I cannot believe that this book is a thing. I hate to say it but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. It was crude, humorless mainly because it tried way too hard to be funny, and unremarkable. The one good thing to come out of this is that I borrowed this from the library and therefore didn't spend money on it."}, {"userName": "Samantha", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10067920-samantha", "userReview": "The humor was crude just for the sake of being crude and I didn't laugh once. The main character is unlikeable in an attempt to make the book realistic, but in reality it was just annoying. This book tried so hard to be edgy and real...

I just steal them from other spots on Google.* I'm too lazy to even try and learn to make my own gifs. * I don't especially hate John Green (take that you haters) I read TFIOS and it was an okay book. Not very realistic to someone who has survived lived with teenagers.This book is about Greg Gaines. He just wants to make it through his last year of high-school. He knows not many people make it through un-scarred for life. \nHis friend Earl also is in the story. Earl gets a five star for the amount of profanity that he can come up with.Then Greg's mom pushes him to become friends again with Rachel. She has been diagnosed with AML (Leukemia). He balks. He doesn't do friends. That's how he has survived the highschool experience so far. He ends up caving because of the nagging.This book is not deep and life altering. This book is what all young adult books should be if they didn't have their asses on crooked and think that young people always think deep thoughts. Because people..the young adults I know...they are full of shit. That's more the norm.Take Greg for instance:So if this were a normal book about a girl with leukemia, I would probably talk a shitload about all the meaningful things Rachel had to say as she got sicker and sicker, and also probably we would fall in love and have some incredibly fulfilling romantic thing and she would die in my arms. But I don't feel like lying to you. She didn't have meaningful things to say, and we definitely didn't fall in love. So if you are looking for this....\nGo find some other book.If this is more to your liking:Jesus Christ on a cockwagon. At the beginning of this sentence, my Feeling Like a Dick Quotient was a solid 4.0, which is normal. By about the word \"excuse\", it was all the way up to 9.4. By the end I was easily maxed out at 10.0.

And snarky certainly describes our narrator. The problem is, I can appreciate snarky when I like the character. I never grew to like Greg. And because I didn't like him or the story line, things like the excessive cussing in the book really bothered me. Had I liked or felt drawn to the characters, I could forgive that flaw. Heaven knows I can speak in language that would make my mother cringe and a sailor seem tame.I was so excited to find a book with an African American character represented on the front cover. And then I was appalled as Earl and his family were defined in painful stereotypes of the African American community. Single mom, stepdad left, multiple boyfriends, alcoholic. Brothers who are \"gangbangers\" and sell drugs, a run-down house. Earl is described as looking perpetually \"pissed\" and having anger issues and violent tendencies. At the end, he goes to work at Wendy's instead of pursuing college.Greg, on the other hand, is white, lives with both parents, father is a college professor, mom runs a non-profit. 2 sisters who, as far as we know, are good kids. Pursues film school at the behest of the dying girl.I think it really got to me when Greg described the school principal \"an African American guy\", big and scary and with the same \"pissed\" look that Earl has. Now the author has created two \"angry\" African American males.I know there are those who will argue that they know someone like Earl, that it is \"reality\", that I am too sensitive. But these descriptors are not accidents. If we are going to put books in the hands of kids, then we have to begin to be willing to have the hard conversations that ask why the reality here is so starkly different for these two characters. Why can't the race of the two characters be switched? Are we going to perpetually defend the use of these stereotypes?

This book made me laugh my ASS OFF. I have never in my whole life laughed this much while reading a book. Jesse Andrews, for this alone, YOU ARE AWESOME.M&E&tDG is one of the weirdest books I've ever read. Nothing much really happens--in terms of both plot or character development--and despite that, driven alone by the MC, Greg's, humorous voice, the book ends up being an awesome read.Just to lay out how hilarious Greg's jokes are, here's an excerpt--although keep in mind, it's MUCH funnier in context:...it's just never a good idea to compliment a girl's boobs. I had to learn this the hard way. Also, it's somehow worse to draw attention to the fact that there are two boobs. I don't know why this is, but it's true. \"You have nice boobs.\" Bad. \"You have two nice boobs.\" Worse. \"Two boobs? Perfect.\" F minus.If somehow you couldn't tell, the humor in this book ain't exactly G-rated.And seeing as how this is a book about 'cancer', it's the last thing you'd expect it to be. The gist of the story has Greg, a more-or-less typical senior, bumbling along through the torture that is high school, when his life changes once his mother forces him to befriend Rachel, a girl he once knew in Hebrew school who has leukemia.Here's the no. 1 reason I loved this book: It proves that life does not have to be so fucking serious all the time. Right before M&E&tDG I read this very poignant novel about bipolar disorder, and it left me feeling utterly bereft, so saying that this book helped lighten my mood is saying quite a bit. Even though the book is about cancer, it doesn't force itself to be all falsely emotional and life-affirming etc etc. Because sometimes death isn't soul-crushing and earth-shattering and la-di-da--sometimes it just is, ya know? (Please tell me I did not sound like a soulless bastard when I said that.)Greg's also obsessed with film making, and he loves this one movie so much--Aguirre, Wrath of God--that he convinced even me to watch to it. Even though (a) the movie is in German, (b) it's ages old, and (c) it's, well, old and foreign! So parts of the book include him making movies with Earl, his best friend, who's also a great source for laughs. Some of the novel is in script format, and parts of it are so hilarious I had cramps from laughing so hard.I will admit, however, that sometimes Greg's jokes did get a tad tiring. There's only so much self-deprecation you can take before it gets annoying. Even so, his sense of humor is seriously out-of-the-park zany. Also, the last 40 pages for me, I dunno, fell a bit flat. Maybe I was expecting something even a tiny bit profound to finally happen, or maybe it was that Greg stopped cracking jokes every third sentence, which is sort of the strongest point of the book.Who cares, though, really? Reading this book was an awwwesome, hysterically funny and upbeat experience, and if that's what you're looking for, definitely fetch a copy of this book for yourself."}, {"userName": "Steph Sinclair", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4642710-steph-sinclair", "userReview": "This is the book I wish received more attention than The Fault in Our Stars. Unlike the aforementioned novel, it doesn't glamorize a terminal illness and try in any way to make light of the situation. In case that offends anyone, keep in mind that I did enjoy TFIOS, but I just think Me, Earl and the Dying Girl had a more powerful message.This isn't going to be a book for everyone. The protagonist is an anti-hero who will anger the reader and make you wish he were a real person just so you could slap some sense into him. He is flawed in every possible way, but he was so realistic, that I couldn't help but to kinda like him. Maybe. In a strange turn of events, Greg finds himself hanging out with Rachel, a girl in his class that was recently diagnosed with cancer. And he hates it. In the beginning he feels a sense of obligation to spend time with her because she's dying. He gets that she's dying, but he doesn't understand how to handle it, and as a result, says some pretty offensive stuff to her and is just a general jerk. But he keeps trying to do better, visits her in the hospital and tries very hard to make her laugh until her last day.\u201cThere was just something about her dying that I had understood but not\u00a0really\u00a0understood, if you know what I mean. I mean, you can know someone is dying on an intellectual level, but emotionally it hasn't really hit you, and then when it does, that's when you feel like shit.\u201dGreg showed a lot of growth in\u00a0the end from going from a character who didn't seem like he gave a shit to one who became obsessed with helping a friend, who didn't realize how much her dying was affecting him.\u201cAnd the point of Rachel the Film should really have been to express how awful and shitty that loss was, that she would have become a person with a long awesome life if she had been allowed to continue living, and that this was just a stupid meaningless loss, a motherfucking loss, a loss loss loss fucking loss, there was no fucking meaning to it, there was nothing that could come out of it...\u201dWhat I loved the most was how Me, Earl and the Dying Girl showed a teen who didn't know how to deal with losing a friend, something I'm sure many teens don't understand. Death sucks. Seeing it happens just multiplies that times 1,000. There are no heroes in a story like that.

All of these things and more are what I learned from the book: 1. If the author through his main character keeps warning you to stop reading his \"stupid book\", by all means read it. Even if he tells you that you might want to commit homicide or murder the author himself after reading the book,  READ IT.  Because I can promise you that it is going to be one of the most original books you'll ever read.2. The book made me realize that Veronica Roth patterned the premise of her phenomenal series on the most mundane and most common institution- the High School.

Just because something is weird and hard to understand doesn't mean it's creative. Lol. This is HONESTLY true!8.

Although both Jesse Andrews and John Green had the same intention - to write a story about cancer that was different from those other tearjerky novels, in my eyes, Andrews was much more successful at stepping away from melodrama and cliches of the genre than Green. Of course, Andrews does not (yet) have a publicity platform of Green's magnitude to promote his novel, so I am glad to be able to help him out a little, because, from my perspective, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is a better, more honest, more real book than The Fault in Our Stars.It is better mainly because it does not try to force you into feeling all the obvious things we are expected to feel reading stories about young, terminally ill characters. There is a certain compulsion to idealize cancer kids, lives ending so tragically early and all that. It is also pretty common to practically guilt you into feeling sorry for their specific predicament. But I like that Andrews allows his characters, even his hero, to be resentful and maybe indifferent towards or burdened by the illness, that his cancer-stricken patient is not an ever-so-wise, heroic saint, that there are maybe no life lessons to learn from such personal tragedies. Maybe having a dying girl in your life is just an event that will affect you in a major way, or maybe it will not and that would be okay, too.Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is not all about cancer though, in fact, the dying girl subplot plays only a relatively small part in Greg's story. It is more about Greg defining himself, stopping to play so safe, about bringing a little more focus onto his future and about understanding of who he is. The author might be a little coy repeating again and again in his narrative that there is no point to this novel, but there is one.Another good thing about Me and Earl and the Dying Girl is that it is very funny. The success of the book with a reader will depend a lot on what he/she finds funny though, because, admittedly, the novel is filled with jokes of the bathroom variety, you know, boogers, boobs and boners. But it was funny to me nevertheless.Great dialogue, self-deprecating humor (albeit occasionally too self-deprecating to be not annoying), vulgarity, wacky secondary characters, fresh (to me) approach to portraying cancer - I enjoyed it all and I hope you will too."}, {"userName": "Natalie Monroe", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6688207-natalie-monroe", "userReview": "[he wants to go to film school, even though he acknowledges he might just end up at Wendy's someday.

Well, no, I guess there\u2019s no kinda about it, she does have cancer.\u201d\u201cOh god, it\u2019s one of those books, isn\u2019t it?\u201dNO!It is not one of those books. Yes it\u2019s about someone who has cancer but it\u2019s not a cancer book. Are you still with me? I\u2019ll take that as a yes.I often think that some writers think that if a book is about (or, in this case, features) a difficult subject then their readers must be crying all the way through the book to show that they have succeeded in handling it in an honest and realistic way.Thankfully, Mr Andrews shows that this is not the case. Although, while I\u2019ve been writing this I\u2019ve realised that, in my trying to convince you this that this book isn\u2019t about cancer, all I\u2019ve done is talk about cancer.So, one last time with feeling or\u2026 um...y\u2019know\u2026 bold writing.THIS BOOK ISN\u2019T ABOUT CANCER.So seeing as I\u2019ve just been chatting on about this book is not about, I should probably talk about what it actually is about, shouldn\u2019t I?This book, in a nutshell, is about a boy stumbling wildly through adolescence with the help of a brilliant and hilarious friend named Earl.Except I don\u2019t really mean help\u2026 because Earl doesn\u2019t really help him as such. He just swears a lot and is gross and crude and is just generally brilliant at random intervals throughout this book. Throw in some fantastic Son of Rambow-eqsque scenes and you have one of the funniest and memorable double acts in young adult literature.I really loved Greg, both as a character and a narrator. He was fresh, original and definitely the kind of person I would want to punch in the arm on numerous occasions. Yeah, he wasn\u2019t always likeable but what seventeen year old boy is? I could chat on for a bit about all my favourite Greg moments but when I went back and looked at my notes I realised I\u2019d pretty much highlighted everything for the first few chapters and then I gave up and just vowed to re-read it again. This book had pretty much everything: lists, scripts, film reviews. I loved these different styles because they were hilarious, original and really added a lot to the book.The only quibble I had was that some jokes went on for a smidgeon too long and I realised I had no idea how we\u2019d got to that bit and I was probably just laughing because I thought I should be. Oh, except that I also wish there was more Earl. He should get his own book\u2026 and television series. I would watch that religiously and probably buy the box set.I loved how this book never set out to trick you and lull you into a false sense of security of laughter only to bombard you with sadness and a message at the end. It stated from the get go that this was a hilarious and ridiculous book and if you were looking for a message and/or meaning, it\u2019s your own fault if you\u2019re left disappointed. \u201cIf this were a touching romantic story, in this moment some STRANGE NEW FEELING would wash over Greg, a sense of being understood, in a basic way that he almost never understood. Then, Greg and Rachel would make-out like lovesick badgers. However, this is not a touching romantic story. There is no NEW FEELING that washes over Greg. There is no BADGER MAKE-OUT SESSION.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still reading this. You should smack yourself in the face a couple of times right now, just to complete the outstandingly stupid experience that is this book.\u201d\u201cYou can take pretty much any sentence in this book and if you read it enough times, you will probably end up committing homicide.\u201d See?!No message.Nada.This book doesn\u2019t want you to learn anything!Hurrah.I think the only similarity this book has with a \"cancer book\" is that you shouldn\u2019t read it in public because seriously, the amount of bellowing laughter this book caused was ridiculous. And kind of embarrassing. My normal, everyday laugh resembles the bark of a dying seal with a cold and this book took that to a whole new level.I\u2019ll let your imagination deal with that one.OK, I\u2019m reading through my review and I\u2019ve realised I\u2019ve not really said anything about this book to convince you whether it\u2019s right for you so I\u2019m just going to stop.This book made me:Laugh.Snort.Snort-laugh.Really look forward to see what Mr Andrews writes next. I received an advanced copy of this book from the publishers via Netgalley.You can read this review and lots of other exciting things on my blog, Wear the Old Coat."}, {"userName": "Maja (The Nocturnal Library)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4551536-maja-the-nocturnal-library", "userReview": "3.5 starsMe and Earl and the Dying Girl is a very strange book indeed. I\u2019m sure some of you read the blurb and thought: Not another cancer book! Really, are books about teens with cancer the new black?! Yeah, I thought so too. It turns out that this book has very little to do with cancer. It has more to do with several other, completely unrelated things like filmmaking, high school social structure, odd friendships and nagging parents. It\u2019s certainly not a sob story. The only tears I\u2019d shed while reading it were caused by laughter. \nMy point is this: This book contains precisely zero Important Life Lessons, or Little-Known Facts About Love, or sappy tear-jerking Moments When We Knew We Had Left Our Childhood Behind For Good or whatever. And, unlike most books in which a girl gets cancer, there are definitely no sugary paradoxical single-sentence-paragraphs that you\u2019re supposed to think are deep because they\u2019re in italics.\nThis is where I would normally write a lengthy plot summary, but I\u2019m afraid my usual reviewing patterns simply won\u2019t work for this book. Greg Gaines is a normal, awkward teenage boy who prides himself in the fact that he doesn\u2019t belong to any of the usual groups in high school, but is on friendly terms with everyone. He only has one real friend, his complete opposite, Earl. When a girl from his school gets leukemia, Greg\u2019s mother makes Greg spend time with her, and as much as he doesn\u2019t want to, he\u2019s too afraid of his mother to say no. Greg Gaines, our main character, assumed the role of the author, which led to a lot of self-deprecating humor (and made me think that he was also, at least partly, an author surrogate). Although I\u2019ll be the first to admit that his observations about his own writing were often hilarious, I did feel that the whole thing was overdone at times. A good joke can only be good for so long before it becomes downright annoying. Here\u2019s just one example:\nAnd that\u2019s part of the backstory for me and Earl. It\u2019ll probably be relevant later, although who really knows. I can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still reading this. You should smack yourself in the face a couple of times right now, just to complete the outstandingly stupid experience that is this book.\nThat is just one example in which an invisible line was crossed and Greg\u2019s story stopped being funny and became eye-roll inducing. That doesn\u2019t mean, however, that this book didn\u2019t have incredibly funny moments. It is, after all, based almost entirely on humor, and the kind of humor that actually worked for me most of the time. It is what kept me reading even after I realized that there isn\u2019t an actual plot to speak of. The fact that it took me a while to even notice says enough about the kind of narrative we\u2019re dealing with here. I honestly think that I\u2019m not the intended audience for this book, but that didn\u2019t stop me from enjoying it. In many ways, it provides a realistic insight into a teenage boy\u2019s mind, and that\u2019s something we (I) don\u2019t see enough of. Do I think you should read this book? Definitely. It\u2019s not a book that you\u2019ll read compulsively, so it\u2019s best to pick it up when you\u2019re otherwise preoccupied. It\u2019s one of those books you can abandon for a while and go back to whenever you feel like it. There are times when that\u2019s exactly what I\u2019m looking for: a light, fun read that will allow me to focus on other, more important things."}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/EDIT: I NEVER change my rating, but this one deserves all 5 and I don't know what assholery I was up to when I first reviewed it and knocked it down half a star. Also, THIS (http://www.buzzfeed.com/danieldalton/...) was a thing a couple of weeks ago and Jesse Andrews already did it for realsies with Earl. Also #2, I used to write non-giffified reviews. How lame.Greg has managed to make it to his senior year by being an acquaintance to all and a friend to none one. When you\u2019re a rodent-faced, chubby kid growing up in a not-so-great area and attend a high school of cliques that run the gamut of nerd to criminal, it\u2019s probably best to just blend in so you never get singled out. His only friend has always been Earl \u2013 a foul-mouthed, chain-smoking, vertically challenged, roundhouse-kicking kid from a broken home, who has pretty much raised himself in a house filled with drug dealing, gangbanging brothers. After Greg decided to give up on having other friends (or ever getting a girl), he and Earl spent all their free time making their own versions of their favorite movies. That is, until Greg\u2019s mother tells him he has to rekindle a friendship with Rachel, a girl from his Hebrew classes ages ago, who is now battling leukemia. Begrudgingly following his mother\u2019s demand request, Greg (and Earl) do as told, eventually letting Rachel in on their secret and sharing their movies with her. Rachel\u2019s dying wish of her new two friends is for them to make a new movie for her. Unfortunately, said movie ends up being the \"Worst Film Ever Made\" and Greg finds himself in the spotlight he has hidden from all his life.How can I even describe how much I liked this quirky little novel. After realizing he has made the \u201cWorst Film Ever Made\u201d, Greg has taken to paper to write his tale rather than put it on film. His self-deprecation (i.e., \u201cI can\u2019t believe you\u2019re still reading this. You should smack yourself in the face a couple of times right now just to complete the outstandingly stupid experience that is this book\u201d) and complete honesty about being an awkward teenager (\u201cHe has just gotten home from school and is trying to read \u201cA Tale of Two Cities\u201d for class, but it is difficult for him to maintain focus, because inside his pants he has AN INEXPLICABLE BONER\u201d) made me have a \u201cyou had me at hello moment\u201d. I am always reeled right in by the loveable loser. (And cover art. God am I a cheap date for a good cover.) Although nearly 100% certain I would like this book right from the get-go, I never imagined what would happen when Earl entered my life. Earl is one of my favorite characters of the entire year. He gives you zero time to pity the poverty and drugs he has been raised around \u2013 instead he is just a constant ball of hilarity and brilliance and I remain smitten.If you\u2019re concerned about this being a replay of \u201cA Fault In Our Stars\u201d and turning into a huge boo-bag because you\u2019re reading a book that flat out tells you it\u2019s about a dying girl, have no fear. Yes, there is a dying girl, but she is really more of an accessory to the story. Andrews doesn\u2019t let you in Rachel\u2019s life so far as to rip your heart out at her suffering. He just gives you enough info to get you a little misty.If you\u2019re a fan of John Green or Matthew Quick or Stephen Chbosky, you should not be disappointed with Jesse Andrews.

I don't normally give out one star but whenever i do there has got ro be something wrong... This was not a funny book in my opinion it was highly innapropriate.... Greg was selfish... Earl had a foul mouth and needed someone to wash it out with a good bar of soap! If i talked the way Earl did then my mama would of grounded me for life! Rachel was the only character who actually seemed okay. This is not the right message we should be sending out to our children or our youth. We should be teaaching our children to love and care for others..... Greg seems like he cares but all he worries about i his stupid videos... Greg had an attitude and deserved the beating he got from Earl! Earl was the worst he really cared for Rachel more then Greg did and i could sense that but he really has no bussiness being in a book that might possibly be picked up by a fourth or fifth grader. The author should have more considerate in what was put in his or her's book because the children who read are the children of the future and if we want them all mini Earls then let them keep reading things like this. I will never let my kids touch this kind of nonsense... I did not laugh whenever it supposed to be funny and i not cry when i supposed to cry..... I just kinda starred at it with no emotions what so ever! This book is a one star read for me and i don't plan on picking it up again anytime in the future... I am very dissapointed because whenever i picked it up from the library i was so anxious to read it and now i am suprised that i got all the way threw it i completly wasted my time. I'm so, so, so sorry Jesse Andrews but this was rotten.... I do plan to read more of the authors books and i hope and pray that i like them because i hate giveing bad reviews it crushes my heart.. I think i am going to cry... :(So i just finished the movie so as i promised lets compare\u2026 Let me start by saying\u2026 What the HE DOUBLE HOCKEY STICKS was ths? The movie was just as bad possibly not worse but it was BAD! Greg is not as selfish as the book and this time he does cry whenever Rachel passes away which got me. Earl was still foul mouthed and Rachel did not play her role very well. My mother wanted to watch this movie with me but i firmly told her no because it was so bad and i am always happy to watch family movies. My sister had no bussiness watching this so called film but she liked it more then i did\u2026 Sometimes i wanted to get up and slap the stupid out of these teenagers\u2026 Yes this is how teenagers are these days but its stuff like this that sets the example. Hey everyone i have got an idea\u2026 Lets all go befriend a dying girl and whenever we go over to her house we can be on drugs and then we can take her out to ice cream and talk crap behind eachothers backs\u2026 Would you like that? No? Good because neither would I! I cannot even go on the book and the movie were so bad\u2026 I am not even going to give it another chance EVER!

Out loud.Of course I earned a lot of weird glances. Merry Christmas, that's so nice of you! \u2714 Therefore, I laughed out loud during the whole book : in the train, in the park, in front of my family. Well, the whole time. Mostly, because of Greg, the main character and narrator of the book, the Me of the title, my buddy Greg. \"Music really only interested me as a soundtrack to a movie, and as for sports, I mean, come on. It's some guys throwing some balls around, or trying to knock each other over, and you're supposed to watch them for three hours at a time, and it just sort of seems like a waste. I dunno.\"Greg was such a relatable character! In my opinion, one of the most credible and believable teenager's voice I've had the opportunity to hear for years. Oh, if you're weird. I was undeniably odd in high-school. Maybe I'm still a bit. So Greg? Here's what I loved about him : \u2714 The highly entertaining movies he makes with his friend coworker Earl. At first, when I became aware that we'd have to go through the description of every single movie they made, I kind of freaked out. I mean, I'm not a movie-hater, but I'm not a movie-lover either. But you know what? It became one of my favorite parts of the book, because those summaries? Awesome. What? You're not taking my word on it? See for yourself! That's free! \nAstonishing movie #1\n : I though the exact same thing!\"Apocalypse Later (dir G. Gaines and E. Jackson, 2007). Again, not our best title. Once we found out what the apocalypse was, we thought that it was ridiculous that Apocalypse Now was not, in fact, about the End of the World. This movie can best be summed up like this : 1. Earl, wearing a bandanna and holding a Super Soaker, demands to know when the apocalypse is happening.2. Offscreen, I tell Earl that the apocalypse is not for a while.3. Earl sits in a chair and does a lot of cussing.4. Repeat.\"\nAstonishing movie #2\n : Tested and approved by my cats!\"Cat-ablanca (dir G. Gaines and E. Jackson, 2008). The thing is, cats can't act.\"\nAstonishing movie #3\n : Because the title says it all!\"Batman versus Spider-Man (dir G. Gaines and E. Jackson, 2011). (...) The bat and the spider have never been enemies... until now!!!!\"\nAstonishing movie #3546286\n : Ha ha ha, you've seen my point?\u2192 Greg, you're totally cool. I wanna hang-out with youuuuuuuuu. Sorry about that.\u2714His hilarious way to relate his own-life and the honesty with which he sees himself : No, Greg isn't perfect, even far from it. He doesn't know how to handle what he sees at first as a burden : that is to say, reacquainting himself with a former not-so-friend, Rachel, because she has been diagnosed with cancer. He isn't popular, isn't selfless, and especially not courageous. But his way to make a one-man-show of his own life was so funny I couldn't help but forgive him, even when he was being a coward. And even if I'm not able to point the exact moment I started to be moved by him, that happened. Suddenly I've been touched by the vulnerability implied by every single sentence we read. \"It was like when a dog makes a human-style face at you and you're temporarily thrown off guard by it. You're like, \"Whoa, this dog is feeling a mixture of nostalgic melancholy and proprietary warmth. I was not aware that a dog was capable of an emotion of that complexity.\"I've already written more than 500 words and I didn't even begin to deal with the cancer issue. Don't think I'm stalling - I'm not. In my opinion, this book manages to handle the cancer issue in a way so accurate I consider it as a real \ngem\n. Why am I thanking Jess Andrews? Because he never magnifies cancer and cancer patients. You won't find here neither artificially-created love stories nor random teenagers magically answering existential questions. Because cancer does change people, but not always that much. Oh, and Greg is pissed. Yes, he is pissed, mad, and goes through all these emotions which have been labeled as bad. Rachel isn't always fearless and strong : she's upset, scared, she wants to give up sometimes, because fighting all the time is not humanly possible. Finally, one of the main character is diagnosed with cancer but can Me, Earl and the dying girl be reduced to it? Definitely not.That's only an amazing, heart-warming, laugh-out-loud book you don't want to miss. Only. Icing on the cake? Listen to Greg : \"If after reading this book you come to my home and brutally murder me, I truly do not blame you\"PS: And I didn't talk about Earl! Earl's the best. That's all you need to know.\"So I said, \"Ugh, there was just this badger picture in my head for some reason.\"It goes without saying that the moment those words left my lips, I wanted to do serious injury to myself.\"Badger,\" Madison repeated. \"Like the animal?\"\"Yeah, you know,\" I said feebly.

On one hand: this book made me laugh like nothing else. I can't even count the amount of times I literally laughed out loud. YES. OUT LOUD, PEOPLES! That is a strange phenomenon for this Vulcan. But, on the other hand: I have no idea what the point of this book is, and I hate dirty humour. It doesn't do anything for me. And as the book progressed, the humour just got scungier and I ended up actually disliking the narrator, Greg, a fair bit. I basically read this because there's a movie coming out and BOOK BEFORE MOVIE! HUZZAH! Which is a good thing, because from the preview, I don't think the movie is gonna be like the book. Which is so so ironic, because this book is a) about film-making, and b) has this quote at the end:When you convert a good book to a film, stupid things happen.oh my gosh. LET ME LAUGH. It's true, but also....I'm super curious/wondering/nervous for the movie now. SO! HOW ABOUT A LIST?! (\"Yes, yes please, Cait\", I hear you say, \"we love lists.\")\nTHINGS I LIKED QUITE A LOT:\n+ Like I said: HILARIOUS. I'm just so amazed that I was snickering so much. Greg is really self-deprecating, but brutally honest. He has the funniest way of summing things up and he has such an odd little brain. It was just funny. (Until the humour died and got reincarnated in scunge-ville, but we'll get to that.)+ It breaks the 4th wall spectacularly. A lot of books do this these days...just popping out of narration to talk directly to the reader. But this? This does it PERFECTLY. The entire book is filled with quips and jokes and instructions directly to the reader. It's like a diary, with lists and bullet points and scripts. Greg is also so mortally ashamed of his stupidity at times he makes a lot of comments like this:If after reading this book you come to my home and brutally murder me, I do not blame you.Lemme laugh, Greg. You're adorable. + Also, yes, Greg is quite the narrator. Sure, I've admitted to not loving him a bunch by the end, buuuut he is nothing if not incredibly realistic. And relatable! He's the most average of averagest guys. He's a little chubby and totally let's his mouth get away on him. He's not stupid, but he doesn't particularly apply himself in school. He doesn't have friends, but he's friendly to everyone. He appears to have severe anxiety. I say \"appears\" because this is never ever explained or gone into. I guess it's just assumed to be \"part of being a teen\", but his reactions to a lot of circumstances actually make me think he has anxiety. ANYWAY. I loved Greg for his realness, but he really is AN IDIOT. Like the idiot of idiots and totally makes me despair for the usefulness of teenage boys. I have a brother. Greg is 100% realistic. Ugh. + It's about cancer, but it's not. It's about GREG. So, yes it's a \"cancer book\", but I wouldn't say it's an average one. Greg says right up front that it's not an inspiring book about finding peace through illness. It's just the recounts of a teenage boys senior year and all the craziness that goes down with that. + It's endearing. I just LIKED it okay?!\nNOW WE GET TO THE STUFF THAT I DIDN'T LOVE:\n+ To be honest, Greg was so so self-obsessed. He kind of mentions this in passing by the end, but it started to bother me a lot. I mean, I was enjoying the incredible voice and dialogue and not worrying much about anything...then I started to think about this book, really THINK. The only fleshed out character is: Greg. Everyone else is basically as flat as a crepe. Which is sad and odd. But I feel like Greg was just THAT consumed by his own interior monologue that he really didn't care about anyone else. But since this isn't the point of the book...I feel kind of growly. + Rachel has zero personality. You know the whole \"Dying Girl\" part of the title? That's Rachel. Her personality is: I am dying of cancer. THAT IS NOT OKAY, PEOPLES, IT IS NOT. + Greg really doesn't care about Rachel. He kind of half went out with her back in their youth (like 3 years ago), but they hadn't talked much and then Greg's mother gets him to spend time with her. So: great premise. And it's so awkward and funny...but even by the end, Greg isn't really caring. (Earl calls him out on this.) By the end, I was just getting pretty disgusted at Greg's apathy. + The gross sexist humour. Which, while I'm not condoning it, I know it's just average \"boy minds talk\" but seriously...it stinks. + The story kind of has no point. I mean, I guess it does....\"don't be self obsessed?\" and Greg WARNS us on the first page that it's not a book with a deep moral. But that's kind of the issue. I was waiting for a revelation or something, but...nothing happens. THERE IS JUST GREG, BEING A BLOB. I wanted to see character development, but Greg on page 1 is the same as Greg on page 295. Which is not okay. I really don't know what to \"take away\" from this book. So YES I enjoyed it. But I'm dubious about it's depth. I'm dubious about the quality of the story...but at the same time, I laughed so hard and I couldn't put it down. It was enjoyable. The voice and writing and narration are PERFECT, like I'm actually talking to someone. SO YOU SEE MY PAIN IN RATING THIS BOOK?! In the end I went for 3-stars, because I liked it, but YEAH. Issues. (Seriously, I can't wait for the movie though. Even if I think they're going to do more on the film for Rachel than the book did.)"}], "description": "Greg Gaines is the last master of high school espionage, able to disappear at will into any social environment.
