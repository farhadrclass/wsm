Not only do I enjoy studying the myths and rituals and histories behind the many beliefs that exist, I am also intrigued by the way occult references and symbolism influence and find their way into pop culture. Books and films centered on these themes are among some of my favorite works, when they are done well. Sometimes, you find work where it\u2019s obvious the creator tried too hard without the proper knowledge. Fortunately, that is NOT the case with First Born: Tales of the Liber Monstrorum.Bob Freeman delivers a well-written, well-informed collection of occult-based horror and dark fantasy tales that will leave any fan of the genre wanting more. Mysterious, chilling creatures and entities lurk among the shadows of this atmospheric anthology, keeping you on the edge, waiting for the next eerie occurrence to be brought to the light\u2013if there is any! Without giving too much away, I would simply say that, as a fan of this genre and style of work, I really enjoyed First Born: Tales of the Liber Monstrorum and would highly recommend it to not only fans of the occult, but also to horror and dark fantasy readers, because you are sure to be creeped out and entertained all at once. It is quite apparent Mr. Freeman is vastly educated on the topics that find their way into his tales, because it shines through, alongside his ability to weave a top-notch story."}, {"userName": "Freeman Presson", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48110329-freeman-presson", "userReview": "Genre fiction with a vengeanceIf you like the genre, you'll love Landon Connors and the entourage of standing characters in Bob Freeman's imaginarium. The tales in this volume range from the classic noir detective yarn with Connors at the center, to horror stories set in rural places like those of the author's youth.There are a few rough spots that could have been caught in editing and proofing, but not enough to lop off a star from a book that ended too quickly."}], "description": "From the arcane sorceries of \u201cThe Wickedest Man in the World\u201d to the supernatural exploits of Occult Detective Landon Connors and the harrowing investigations of Agents Wolfe and Crowe,this collection of macabre tales of the black arts treads the dangerous landscape between this world and that populated by angels and demons, gods and devils, ghosts and spirits, and the legendary creatures of our darkest imaginings.
