I found them a bit repetitive because they were almost all essays that had been previously published in different places, so the author was following similar themes in multiple settings. She lives in St. Louis and speaks to the topics from a personal place too, not just a journalist, but someone whose children attend school here, who experiences the same kind of legislation, etc. That added a layer that made the essays much more real.A lot of attention has been given to Hillbilly Elegy: A Memoir of a Family and Culture in Crisis to \"understand Trump voters.\" I think this book is more steeped in facts and numbers, doesn't stereotype all Trump voters or everyone in flyover country to the most extreme racist white guys who lost their manufacturing jobs (Kendzior exhibits far more nuance than that), and is probably a better picture of what has been going on for normal people trying to make it in America, and overall really not making it.Thanks to the publisher for providing access to this title.

I haven't read the edition from Flatiron Books, which may contain different material.)Sarah Kendzior ended up being my canary in a coal mine when it came to a recent large-scale political event. Or more accurately she was my Cassandra; I unfollowed her on twitter for a while before that event because I thought she was being too alarmist. Turns out, she was 100% correct. We can only hope her predictions of our future beyond today are less crushingly awful than she thinks they will be.I came to this book looking for the seeds of the insights I'd seen in her twitter feed. They're there, but not as obviously as I might have been looking for. This book is a collection of essays published online between 2012 and 2014, more or less, and between the essays there's a decent amount of repetition, especially when it comes to the poverty-level pay of adjunct professors. The jobs described in this book are on the elite spectrum: international relations (i.e. the U.N.), journalism, universities, things along those lines. Those lower on the ladder in these organizations need to be elites themselves, with some sort of support outside their jobs, in order to develop connections during internships that offer no pay.In the last section of the book, where one essay discusses Snowden in parallel with a look back to the Bush era of the '00s, and another talks about resistance in Uzbekistan, I saw glimpses of the global insight I've come to expect from her twitter feed.In the end, I'd like to see a longer-form book from Ms. Kendzior. This was fine, but as often happens with me and essay collections, I didn't find an overall arc to tie the whole thing together and the package taken together was somewhat unsatisfying."}, {"userName": "Sona", "userReviewDate": "May 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11441194-sona", "userReview": "I have been following the work of Sarah Kendzior for quite a long time now and regularly read her essays on Aljazeera and elsewhere.

Over the course of the day, and into the evening, political pundits continued to predict Clinton would prevail, even as the Trump campaign gained significant leads and the election ended in a Trump victory. But there was at least one person who was not surprised: Sarah Kendzior, an academic researcher and St. Louis based journalist, could see the writing on the wall that others missed, and became one of the first credited with predicting the outcome. Between 2012 \u2013 2014, Kendzior wrote a series of essays, originally published by Al Jazeera, about the broken promise of the \u201cAmerican Dream\u201d for the people living in-between the coasts, otherwise known as \u201cflyover country.\u201d Now a selection of those essays has been collected for the first time in print, The View From Flyover Country: Dispatches from the Forgotten America, and it is a searing, heartbreaking and unforgettable read.Kendzior had been studying authoritarian states in Eastern Asia for years, and began to recognize signs in the US that she had seen in the countries she examined. She then began to write about those observations through the lens of her life in St. Louis. She touches on varying subjects, including the rise of adjunct faculty, along with the corresponding decrease in tenured faculty, at US colleges and universities. How students at those same institutions of higher learning are facing rising tuition costs, often going into debt to pay them, and finding, upon graduation, that the only pathway to a job in their chosen field requires them to work unpaid internships. She also noted the rise in bigotry in the US, whether related to race, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or possibly most importantly, in our current climate and economic status. Kendzior unflinchingly conveyed the results of decades of inequalities enacted on those whose protests have not been heard.\u201cIt is easy when people feel frightened and abandoned, for a demagogue to exploit those feelings of despair for political gain. It is easy for that demagogue to translate fear into fanaticism, to shift extremism into the mainstream and market it under the guise of populism. By the time buyer\u2019s remorse hits, a new and more brutal political culture has arisen. A gaslit nation becomes engulfed in flames.\"While Kendzior may have been one of the first to raise these issues, she is clearly not the last. Many of the topics addressed in her book are now part of our continuing national discourse, and regularly talked about on television, radio, in print and on the web, which makes The View From Flyover Country all the more essential a book to read right now.Reading The View From Flyover Country may be difficult. It is made easier because most of the collected essays are only a few (less than 5) pages long, resulting in a series of thoughtful and thought-provoking short forays into incredibly difficult subjects. What the essays possibly lack in enjoyment, more than makes up for in insight and information, articulating the fear and isolation many living \u201cbetween the coasts\u201d have felt for far too long. And these are feelings that are now shared by a great many people across the US. In the preface to the book, Kendzior states that while she never meant to write a \u201cdepressing\u201d book, she also admits that it very well may be one. She also claims that \u201cOne cannot solve a problem until one acknowledges a problem exists.\"Reviewed by Daryl M., Librarian, West Valley Regional Branch Library"}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2809380-sharon", "userReview": "I've been following Sarah Kendzior's writing for a while, possibly since Ferguson first made it into mainstream news. I bought her book because I wanted to support her work. This book is strictly a collection that republishes essays and articles she's written before, with some minimal organization into certain topics.When I revisited the book in November 2016, I wanted to understand how the United States elected Trump and what history predicts for our near future. I found that the essays were less thoroughly supported than I remembered, and that the book wasn't that focused in terms of understanding modern day America. It's definitely still valuable, but maybe not the most urgent thing to read.I think the most critical essays to revisit are the ones about flyover country and about the Iraq war. Here are a few excerpts that stood out to me:\"Iraq showed us that the consequences for gross negligence were less than anyone had imagined. This gaping disconnect between people and power, and the public's resignation to adjusting to injustices rather than challenging them, has shaped the post-war era. . . .We lost more in Iraq than a war. We lost accountability and faith in our institutions, and most of all, we lost the outrage that accompanies that loss, because we came to expect it and accept it as normal.

Each essay seems to build and braid together, exploring race and class. There's exceptional empathy for the educated and poor, as well as the poor and uneducated (\"educated\" in the traditional, scholarly sense). A lot of fascinating and horrible insight into how academics work, too.But the essay that hit hardest? It was the final Coda to the collection, written last September. It's a love story to living in Flyover country -- Kendzior, like me, is a Midwesterner through and through -- and it's more a love song to those in flyover country so often ignored, forgotten, derided, and considered lesser than privileged coastal elite. One of my favorite essays was one that's freely available on Aljazeera (many of these are!) about the death of the mall and mall culture. I ended up chewing over one of her insights on this as part of a podcast, about the growth of thrillers in YA lit.

She spoke with a distinctive and clear voice that resolutely and repeatedly punctured the hot air balloon of what was being reported in the conventional mainstream media. This book is collection of essays in which she captures for the reader a grounded, middle-American (that is, not the Boston-NY-DC or SF-LA) perspective. She unsparingly highlights the economic contrasts between the popular narratives on success and their relationship to hard work, wealth, and race versus the reality that most American are facing today. An academic and journalist, she is unsparing in her cogent and (probably most unforgivable) accurate critique of the structural inequalities and barriers to entry that are faced by those seeking entry. The cost of most college degrees should be a national shame. The fact that only the wealthy can afford to practice journalism is a guarantee that calls for justice will only go out for those causes that white, well-to-do men are able to perceive as \"worthy.\"Each essay is short, and the writing is direct, clear, and deceptively simple.

I found each essay to be well written and obviously she has spent a lot of time thinking about the subject matter, but I'm not sure I always agree with her ultimate conclusions.She often rails against meritocracy, academia and internship programs - with good reason - while she doesn't offer alternatives. I struggle to understand why universities continue to produce Ph.Ds at high rates, while so many have trouble earning a living wage. And knowing this is the result, why are people continuing to get Ph.Ds. In a time when these fields are plagued with unpaid internships and under-paid jobs, why wouldn't the author promote fields where there are well-paying jobs - like the trades. Why rail against the realities of flooded job markets with too many applicants for too few positions. Instead the reader is left with the impression that the ONLY options for well paying jobs are out of reach for the average person. Yet STEM fields are struggling to find people and those careers continue to have new job openings and not enough people to fill them. Part of my issue with this comes from the difference between private education in the US and the public system in my own country. There are few barriers to attendance in my country and even as the daughter of a small, poor farmer in the middle of several years of drought, I was able to earn scholarships and get a degree that has kept me gainfully employed for many years and I didn't go past a bachelor's degree. Where I currently find myself overworked due to a lack of candidates for jobs we have posted.I also found it interesting that in one essay, she commends a woman tweeting her way through the end-stages of cancer, flaying mainstream media sources who expressed discomfort with the situation. Only to be followed by another essay discussing privacy and Edward Snowden. This essay seemed to have an unclear conclusion. Did she support Snowden's actions or not? Does she value privacy? If people can't make educated decisions on what privacy they are giving up, how can she berate people who are uncomfortable with the amount of privacy another person is willing to give up?The essay on truth in the George Bush era comes with a hearty dose of irony as I look fondly back at those days of heady ignorance about how bad creating one's own reality can be for a country, it's people and the world.

And I still don\u2019t, actually. I have come to accept it, however, as a truthful mirror that merely reflects who we have become. This book is a bit unpleasant to read. The author\u2019s elbows are sharp and her prose can be acerbic. But she\u2019s right: It doesn\u2019t matter what we think. It matters only what we do. And we don\u2019t do very well when it comes to protecting the many minorities that are marginalized and painted with a brush they had no hand in constructing. It\u2019s systemic. It\u2019s systemic. It\u2019s systemic.The greatest irony, I believe, is that systemic prejudice is born of America\u2019s globally unequaled lust for individualism. We are the country of the myth that anyone can get ahead if they want it badly enough. Presidential politics aside, it\u2019s a myth. Them that has, gets. In commercializing all of life, including higher education, we have insured the future for the Brahmins to an extent that the Cabots and the Lodges could not have possibly imagined.In the world of the individual, two makes a group, and a few makes a generalization. I am me, but you are \u201cthey\u201d. Not since the Cold War and the great communist conspiracy that lurked in every doorway have we collectively been so overwhelmed by our individuality \u2013 our gender, the color of our skin, our religion, the country in which we were born, etc. I grew up in a small rural town in the American Northeast in which there were literal train tracks and people who lived on either side. Never, however, was there a hint of the animus or fear I feel today in our modern \u201cclassless\u201d society. This book is a re-publication of a series of essays and articles that should be outdated but which are prescient in their timeliness. The title, in one sense, is misaligned with the expectations it created but the content hit me in the gut; in a way that hurt, yes, but, more importantly, in a way that made me pay attention. St. Louis, the gateway to the West, once upon a time. We\u2019ve all been there. We\u2019re all surprised that this book speaks to it. But, no, upon reflection, we\u2019re not surprised. My first trip to St. Louis was on a busload of Boy Scouts heading to the Philmont Scout Ranch in New Mexico from New York. Most of us had never been away from home except for sleeping in the woods on organized hikes or in homemade tree forts constructed of leftover lumber from what used to be known as the local lumberyard.There was prejudice then, of course. There has been prejudice forever. I befriended a young teenage boy who wore his hair in a Mohawk cut in the 1960s due to some familial affiliation with the great Native American nation. Another young boy who looked remarkably like a young James Dean and dressed in a pair of blue jeans and a white undershirt, in which he rolled a pack of cigarettes in the sleeve whenever our leader wasn\u2019t looking, decided he didn\u2019t like this particular boy and harassed him across America. Trust me, it was nothing compared to what many, many young people face today-every day. Then it was mean. Now it is systemic.Because we have institutionalized hate. We have institutionalized prejudice. And in doing so we have made it more personal than ever before. Just another irony. This is a very good book. You may not like it. But you should read it. More importantly, if you love them as much as you believe, you should make sure your kids read it.As Pogo so famously noted, \u201cWe have met the enemy and he is us.\u201d (That, by the way, came to life on a Walt Kelly poster in support of the first annual Earth Day, on April 22, 1970.)"}, {"userName": "Cyndee", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15837525-cyndee", "userReview": "I'm a big fan of Sarah Kendzior and couldn't wait to read this book. I'd read some of her essays online before and enjoyed them. The vast majority of the book consists of essays published on Al Jazeera English in 2012-2014, completely unedited. There is a new introduction and conclusion, but for the most part this is not about the current political situation. Despite the title, the essays are not primarily about \"flyover country.\" The majority are about national and international issues. They aren't really about the stereotypical working class white Trump voters either. More space is devoted to how unpaid internships keep non-elites out of professions such as journalism and policy, and the many problems with academia, from the ridiculous poverty wages of adjuncts to how academic journals keep research cloistered from the public. This is a great discussion and an important one to have, even if I don't see the relationship to the rise of Trump.Because these essays were published independently of each other, there's a great deal of repetition and overlap.

Apart from an epilogue written in 2017 it does not address the Trump presidency. Apart from some very interesting pieces about St. Louis it doesn't have anything specific to say about \"flyover country\", except to the extent that any part of the country that isn't wealthy seems to be flyover country.That said, there are thoughtful and eminently quotable pieces about the sorts of concerns that have made Americans increasingly uneasy and dissatisfied, and to that extent I guess it prefigures the \"forgotten middle class\" explanation for Trump. How and why people fell for Trump's song and dance, though, is not addressed.What is addressed, at length and in convincing fashion, is how decent job opportunities are increasingly foreclosed to all except the wealthy and privileged. From how cities like New York and San Francisco have become just gated communities for elites, and how higher education has become a con and a closed door to the merited poor, Kendzior is articulate and persuasive. Her discussions of the \"post-employment economy\", where everyone is underpaid and insecure, is especially compelling and fairly rigorous. Sections on the \"closing of American academia\" are thought provoking, although the emphasis is on the exploitation of academics rather than of students, which is an interesting angle. There are a few pieces on foreign policy, but we seem to be on less firm ground with those.The upshot, for me, was that I think the sales pitch about being a Trump critic and predicting the rise of Trump is a bit overblown for this collection, but the larger vitality and interest of the pieces, especially about jobs and opportunity, should be valued and appreciated on their own merits. Kendzior moves beyond shallow punditry and her opinions are worth serious thought.

She has an astounding capacity to encapsulate the nuances of a particular problem in clear but endlessly erudite language. The View From Flyover Country embodies the sort of journalism needed today.

The value that Kendzior brings to the table is showing that the mundane platitudes we've either taken for granted (or to heart) need to be re-examined if the US wants to dig its way out of socio-economic decline. (It must be said that Kendzior isn't entirely enthusiastic about our ability to do so.) Are we riding bikes more because we want to be part of the in-crowd doing that, or because we can't afford a car (or public transportation)? Are women staying home with their children because they want to, or because the math of going back to work is forcing them to? And did that fast-food employee not going to college because he's not smart enough, or because he can do math all too well?"}, {"userName": "Joe", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/93909-joe", "userReview": "A necessary tonic for the overly optimistic progressive.

Here we read about the shifting economy and the shifting political landscape that resulted in the election of Donald Trump. When the fruits of your labor is a wage that makes it impossible to pay rent and often those in that situation are highly educated, there is little to keep people from looking for a way out. In a section \"The Post-Employment Economy\" Kendzior details how employment has become a rich persons game. After completing your degree that is historically more expensive than ever before, you can only gain employment by working several unpaid or ridiculously low paid internships. Only the rich can afford to pursue these \"opportunities\" that include traveling to interviews and then staying in some of the most expensive places in the world. One internship at the United Nations ended up in a charity auction and garnered a bid of $22,000. Yes, paying for the opportunity to work for free in hopes that it will lead to something that pays some day. In academia, tenure track jobs are being replaced with \"adjuncts\" that get paid several thousand dollars a class. Their total pay is often below $20,000 a year but it is the only way to have a chance at a tenure job. Once I started, I could not stop reading this book but I recommend having something light on hand for your next read because this is nothing but heavy."}, {"userName": "Andy", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21578205-andy", "userReview": "This is a hard book to rate. I liked the writing style and I think that Kendzior is both talented and insightful. I probably would have gotten this to a 5 star rating had it been a unified book, or maybe a book that was built of essays specifically to illustrate something. Instead, this book is a collection of articles that Kendzior wrote between 2012 and 2014. The articles themselves are excellent. They bring in personal stories, point out injustices, and really try to tie everything back to the US failure to allow the middle class to succeed. This book will make you angry, it will make you sad, and it will challenge you to explain how this has been allowed to happen. The only thing it won't allow you to do is feel confident in the future of America. While the final chapter of the book does touch on recent events, it is disappointing that the main body of the book is focused on things that are 4-6 years old now. It would be one thing if these were one time events in an explanatory change, but they aren't. These are lingering systematic issues that look the same in 2018 (if not worse) than they did in 2014. Maybe that's the point, that the issues America faces are not specific incidents, but ways of being. Regardless, I do think everyone should read this. If nothing else, it should give common ground to those who might disagree on high level politics but still want to make things better."}, {"userName": "Cale", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9288112-cale", "userReview": "This was not a pleasant book to read. I think Sarah Kendzior did herself a disservice by putting the essay 'In Defense of Complaining' as a coda rather than an introduction, because it crystallizes the importance of what the rest of the book is doing -shining a light on problems faced by much of our society. I think the title 'The View from Flyover Country' is a little misleading as well - while the essays occasionally mention St. Louis and Detroit, the perspective is more from the cracks looking up rather than from the heartland looking out. And the book's format does some disservice to the collected essays by compressing them; the repeated commentary about how unpaid internships are pricing out the lower class get a little repetitive when seen every few pages rather than every few weeks. At the same time, driving home central issues like the price of education, the fall of career opportunities and the requirements of higher status jobs that serve as barriers to upward mobility. Sarah also repeats some literary devices in almost every essay. But these are minor quibbles with a book that is important to read, as she highlights issues that may not be making the headlines, but are part of what has hollowed out our culture to the point that the cavity might be leading to full collapse."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/446657-beth", "userReview": "The title and description of this book are pretty misleading - I'm not sure how most of these essays relate to \"living in flyover country,\" as they seem pretty universally american (under employment, low and stagnant wages, systemic bias, gentrification, diminishing trust in government and institutions, etc.). I guess I also expected a bit more \"journalism\" here - interviews, cited sources, etc. - but these essays read more like angry blog posts.Also, I know these were all originally published elsewhere and collected for this book, but there is A LOT of repetition here. The same topics, facts and sentiments appear over and over. Perhaps some of these should've been either consolidated or removed, since this is a collection/book and not one-offs?Finally, while all of these things are important to name and say and talk about, I don't feel like any new ground was covered here. If you've been \"woke\" for a bit, you've already seen and heard all of these complaints and arguments; if you're not, then you're probably not picking up this book anyway. *Thanks to NetGalley for the ARC, provided by the author and/or the publisher in exchange for an honest review."}], "description": "In this collection of essays, St. Louis journalist Sarah Kendzior tackles issues including labor exploitation, racism, gentrification, media bias and other aspects of the post-employment economy.
