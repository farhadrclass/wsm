I love YA. I love reading books about the people that lived in the era of WW2. But most importantly, I love when these elements all align and shed light on a historical story that has long been forgotten. That Burning Summer sheds light on the Polish men, that witnessed their nation under German occupation and traveled( at dangerous risk to their own lives) to Britain to join the RAF. Lydia Syson creates her character Henryk as a representation of what these men saw and endured. Why was this story buried? Well, neither Adolf Hitler or Joseph Stalin felt that this story( each for their own reason) of Polish involvement needed to be heard. They demanded that it be buried! The British were in agreement. Politics, eh? When Henryk's plane crashes close to the home of English teen Peggy and her younger brother, Ernest, we see the world through the eyes of two of England's youth. I feel that this is important to emphasize because there are so many books that examine the adult prospective and experience of the war. Although the ending was a tad rushed and perhaps a little tied in a bow, I couldn't put this book down! I will certainly be on the lookout for this author in the future.Thanks to NetGalley and Skyhorse Publishing for an e-Arc."}, {"userName": "Olivia", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43582060-olivia", "userReview": "{2.5 stars}Overall thoughts:I was confident I would give this 4 stars all the way until about 3/4 of the way through. There were hints of romance, but I found it sweet and tear-worthy. All three POV were fascinating and intriguing. The cover made me want to read this book because once I considered using the very same image for one of my books and funny enough the storyline has similarities :)Why I lowered my rating:It was sad, really, I had to give this such a low rating. Going into this I knew that since it wasn't a Christian book or author I might find something that would be questionable. There was not a sex scene, but I'd say it was very, very, VERY close. I felt uncomfortable with the phrasing as the couple interracted in a romantic way. It frustrated me so much because I loved both of them. I was relieved that the scene was short and after that there wasn't anything else that bothered me.The only other thing to be warned about is there is are a few swear words scatterd throughout-up to ten at the most. The end was a little rushed and I thought it could have been drawn out just a bit more. My favorite character was Henryk. The emotions of what he went through was definitely sad to read.I wouldn't recommend this book, but I did think the storyline riveting and fascinating. *I received this from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Erin ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2997696-erin", "userReview": "Find this and other reviews at: http://flashlightcommentary.blogspot....It\u2019s fair to say that Salt to the Sea and Code Name Verity have ruined me for most young adult fiction. I used to make allowances for less intricate story lines and less emotive characters, but Ruta Sepetys and Elizabeth Wein proved that fiction marketed to adolescents can be just as compelling and addictive as that written for the adult market. The efforts of both authors have raised my expectations of the genre which likely explains my lack of enthusiasm for Lydia Syson\u2019s That Burning Summer.To be fair, I think the novel has a lot going for historically and feel it a creative means of teaching readers about the Battle of Britain and the war time experiences of those on homefront during WWII. I particularly enjoyed those passages that touched on the peace protests and conscious objector movement and felt Syson\u2019s incorporation of these concepts brought a nice degree of context to the larger conflict. I also appreciated Henryk, not as an individual character, but as a representation of Polish pilots and their contribution to the war effort.That said, I felt the novel lacked momentum and I often found myself bored with the style and tone of the telling. I\u2019m not a writer and can\u2019t put my finger on the exact issue, but something in the mechanics of the narrative didn\u2019t mesh the way I needed it to. Much as I liked Syson\u2019s ideas, I couldn\u2019t get into her writing and ultimately didn\u2019t care a whit for the characters or how their stories played out."}, {"userName": "Elaina", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45468451-elaina", "userReview": "~3.5 stars~This book takes place in World War II and I have always liked reading books centered on that time period so I was pretty sure I would enjoy this one and I did for the most part :) I liked the characters from this book-especially Henryk-you couldn't help but feel a little sad for him at times though :/ At first, I did not know that this book would alternate between three points of view, but I really enjoyed that aspect of it! :D I thought that getting to hear Peggy's, Henryk's, and Ernest's different perspectives was really neat! For the past three books I have read, they have all been with alternating POV's and I didn't realize until now just how much I enjoy that :D Plus the chapters were shorter--some only two pages long lol :P which I actually like because I tend to be a slower reader and shorter chapters make me feel like I get through it quicker...not sure if that is true or not, but it feels like it XD There were a few things I would have liked not to be in the story, like the cursing, but I liked pretty much everything else :)*I received an ebook copy from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review"}, {"userName": "\u039b\u03af\u03bd\u03b1 \u0398\u03c9\u03bc\u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03b7", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45574761", "userReview": "What can I say about a book that takes place in the second world war?It was nostalgic because it described childhood but was also sad because it described it in moments of war..

I knew it would be really hard for me not to like it and the different perspectives made it that more interesting. I have read a few books that were simular to this one, but this story turnt out to be different than i thought.This book is told from three perspectives: Peggy, a teenage girl living in England during the war; Ernest, her rule-following brother; and Henryk, the pilot who crashes not too far from their house. Out of the three main characters i liked Henryk to most, he was different and i liked reading about his past and his prived thoughts. As for Peggy and Ernest, i liked Peggy.. but Ernest got on my nerves.. mayby because he is that typical young boy who jumps to conclusions to quick. Peggy reminded me of the girl in the Dutch book that i read before  'Oorlogs Winter' . She was caring and brave, te romance between to two was also so soothing and nice to see blossem. It wasn't like insta love you see nowadays in every book you read in YA.  The reason i liked Henryk so much is because he has great character build, you see him change throught to story. At the beginning of the story he is really afraid of flying again and having to go back to the airforce base, but throughout the story you she he gets is strenght back. As for the other characters, there wasn't much to them.. Ernest really got on my nerves and i wanted to shake him silly and some points. He jumpt from the one conclusion to the other in a heartbeat which didn\u00fd make sence at all. The plot was okey... There's the set-up, which is Henryk crashing and Peggy finding him. Then, there's just a lot about their lives without ever really having the feeling of moving towards something. And because of that, the ending feels really rushed - things actually start to happen when you got to the and of the book. I had to reread quite a few parts just to have any idea of what was happening. I don't mind reading a book with a minimal plot, but when the end is so rushed you feel like the story isn't executed right. Also the Epilogue felly weird sometimes.. i didn't really know what had happend to the characters. But overall the story was more a story set in WWII instead that it was the main theme, it was still a good and entertaining read.I know that things can be changed for the purposes of fiction and that I shouldn't treat this as a history book, but since I knew so little about Poland in that time, it gave me a good general understanding of how things were. After reading this, I'll definitely be looking out for other books with similar settings. I liked this book, it just didn't really impress me.. But thats okey."}, {"userName": "Stephanie (Stepping out of the Page)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2485722-stephanie-stepping-out-of-the-page", "userReview": "Okay, first thing first - that cover! Yes, I completely unashamedly fell for the gorgeous vintage-style cover of That Burning Summer before I knew what the book was even about (though the contents are portrayed pretty well on the cover, actually). I am so glad that That Burning Summer caught my eye after finding out it was set in England during World War Two, I picked it up and absolutely devoured it.That Burning Summer is set in rural England during the Second World War. We are introduced to Peggy, a sixteen year old, who one day, during her daily chores, stumbles across someone who she does not expect to meet - a young Polish pilot named Henryk. Neither are sure whether or not to trust each other, but they do begin to bond until Ernest, Peggy's younger brother, finds Henryk and becomes suspicious. Not only are there obvious difficulties with knowing who to trust or not during a war, we also sometimes have to wonder whether one family member can trust the family member as there are is also an interesting subplot regarding Peggy and Ernest's father. I believe that the main focus of the story is intended to be the gradual building relationship between Peggy and Henryk, but there felt like there was a lot more to think about or to consider if you weren't actually interested in 'romance'.Due to the historical setting of the book, it is clear that this is also a big feature of the book, perhaps more so than anything else. It is very apparent that the author, Lydia Syson, has taken a lot of time and care when writing this book, and I really appreciated that, it was great to be reading and to be learning at the same time. I can't say that I knew much about the roles of the Polish in our RAF services during the war, so it was good to be enlightened! Though I did learn a few new things and appreciated the facts that I already knew, I liked how the information was shared - I never once felt like I was being filled full of facts, and I was never bored!What I loved most about this book was the ease of reading - it was just so lovely to read. I can imagine that this would be great to read in one sitting or as slowly as you like, there is something about it that is so relaxing. To me, it felt like it would have made a fantastic sunday night drama on the TV - an enthralling story with a sweet ending. I really enjoyed this relaxing read and I hope that many others will do too, whether they are older children, young adults or adults. I will definitely be looking out for more books by Syson."}, {"userName": "Alanna", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1585261-alanna", "userReview": "So, recently I've been craving books set during WW2 (especially ones with romance in them), and this book seemed like it could've been just what I was looking for. It was... and it wasn't. Basically, I liked the book but it felt like there was something missing.In general (as I've probably said many times before), I'm not a fan of alternating POV's in books and this was a book with alternating POV's. Peggy's chapters were my favourite, I was kind of indifferent to Henryk's, while Ernest's mostly just annoyed me or bored me and I think that had a big impact on how much I enjoyed the story.I went into the book expecting the romance be a bigger subplot than it actually turned out to be, it was hardly there at all really (at least, it felt that way to me). It felt like we barely got any scenes of Peggy and Henryk together, either because they just didn't have many conversations or because they were left out or glossed over or it was kind of drowned out by all the Ernest stuff.It's kind of hard to explain my thoughts on this book. It's just...I liked it. I liked the characters (although Ernest bugged me--probably because I have a little brother so I was projecting a little bit there), I mostly liked the story, I liked the writing style, and I liked Peggy and Henryk together even though there wasn't nearly enough of it. There wasn't really anything I loved though.The only thing I didn't like was how it ended--it felt a bit rushed? Abrupt? Too something, or not enough something, but I can't pin point what.So yeah, I liked the book, but I wanted to love it. I expected to love it. I just wanted more from it than what I got--I wanted to be totally swept up into the story and lose myself in what the characters were feeling but it didn't make me feel much of anything beyond entertained.I'd rate it 3.5 stars out of 5. I do recommend it, especially if you like stories set during WW2, and you'll probably enjoy it more than I did if you like alternating POV's and don't go into it expecting it to be a romance."}, {"userName": "Clara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10224696-clara", "userReview": "This review can also be found at Lost in My Library. I received a eARC via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I love historical fiction, especially books set during World War II, so when I saw this on NetGalley, I had to request it. I knew it would be really hard for me not to like it! And the perspective made it that much more intriguing - I know I've never read about a Polish pilot before.This book is told from three perspectives: Peggy, a teenage girl living in England during the war; Ernest, her rule-following brother; and Henryk, the pilot who crashes not too far from their house. Out of the three, Henryk was by far my favorite. He was the most interesting to read about, both in the main story and as his past was revealed. I didn't really have any strong feelings one way or the other about Peggy, Ernest, or, for that matter, any of the other characters.I think one of the reasons I liked Henryk the most is that besides his backstory, there isn't really much of a plot until the very end. There's the set-up, which is Henryk crashing and Peggy finding him. Then, there's just a lot about their lives without ever really having the feeling of moving towards something. And because of that, the ending feels really rushed - things actually start to happen, but it's too much and it doesn't make a whole lot of sense. I had to reread quite a few parts just to have any idea of what was happening. I don't mind books with slow/minimal plots if the characters are interesting, but as I said before, they really weren't.Henryk's backstory was interesting, but it also taught me a lot about what was going on in Poland at the time.

The cover is beautiful, and the blurb made it sound like a great read. I couldn't wait to get started.I was quite taken back by how the book opened. I wasn't too sure what Ms Syson was trying to do initially, but it seemed as if I had stumbled onto some poorly written poetry that didn't make any sense. The prose were too lyrical, too short, and to sweetly sticky for my liking. It was difficult to read, let alone engage with.But...it takes a great deal for me to give up on a book so I persevered, and in this instance, I am so glad I did.As the book progressed, the writing became less flamboyant and began to have an easy to read flow to it. Ms Syson settles down to a very nice writing style, and the book blossomed.The story itself is beautiful, and it is set in a very realistic backdrop of WW2. It is very clear that Ms Syson has done her homework and researched the era in great depth, for she brought it back to life. I got completely lost in this book and time flew by because I was so absorbed in the story.Ms Syson deals with a few controversial subjects in this book, which I thought she handled with a very delicate hand. From a child's anxiety to what we call Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, but what they would have called Shell Shock \u2014 which of course wasn't understood so well back then. She also deals with the contentious issue of those who would not bear arms against another, and she highlighted just how dreadful it was if you dared to refuse to go to war and fight. We often forget how barbaric the pacifists and their families were treated by the authorities and by their neighbours.There are three protagonists in this book, and I liked the changing Points of Views. We have young Earnest, who is terrified he is going to stumble upon a spy. There is sixteen-year-old Peggy, who is convinced life is going to pass her by because of the war. Lastly, there is Henryk, a young Polish pilot who has lost his nerve to get back into an aeroplane. This story is about them, and it is sublime.Despite the wobbly beginning, this book is really rather good. That Burning Summer is a very cleverly crafted piece of Young Adult Historical Fiction. It is worth checking out!I Highly Recommend.*I received this book for free copy of this book via Netgalley for review consideration*"}, {"userName": "Candace", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3192690-candace", "userReview": "This book takes place during WWII when a Polish plane crashes in enemy territory. The young pilot, Henryk, is able to bungee out of the seat and survive with minor injuries. Peggy, a 12- year old girl who is staying on her Aunt and Uncle's Farm with her younger brother Ernest, finds the pilot and hides him in a nearby abandoned church. We read about these three beautifully drawn characters as they each struggle with what is right during wartime.This author writes beautifully, confidently, while discussing things that Young Adults will likely be interested in from this era: the regular carrying of gas masks (the anxiety of someone who may have forgotten theirs), women working jobs formerly done by men, and war work necessary to be done on a farm. She also delves into the possibility of two young people who are supposed to be fighting against each other finding each other and maybe even liking each other.

Their father is gone, and Ernest thinks he is fighting in the war, but Peggy seems to know something more about where he is and so do the townspeople, who threat them with some amount of disdain.Ernest is a bit of a neurotic boy, and like many, he's afraid that the Germans are going to invade any minute. He has gotten hold of the leaflet \u201cIf the Invader Comes\u2026\u201d issued by the War Office, which, rather than shoring up his courage, only makes Ernest more fearful.Out riding his bike one day, Ernest sees a plane catch fire and crash land. When he reports it, as per the leaflet, everyone assumes it was a German plane that was swallowed by the marsh along with the pilot. But during the night, Peggy wakes up and discovers the injured pilot hiding by the henhouse.It turns out the pilot, Henryk, is a Polish refugee who is flying with the RAF. Peggy decides to hide him in an abandoned church, and brings his clean clothes that belonged to her father, and some food. Henryk doesn\u2019t want to return to the RAF, he has lost is love of flying, and has decided he just can\u2019t fight anymore. As his story unfolds, Peggy learns about his escape from Poland after the Germans invaded, his travels to other countries to fight, and the loss of his family, including the tragic death of his three younger sisters.Ever vigilant for invading Germans, Ernest eventually finds out about Henryk. As he gets to know him, he\u2019s really torn - wanting to like Henryk but disturbed by what he believes to be Henryk\u2019s LMF or Lack of Moral Fiber. Ernest has been bullied ever since arriving in Romney Marsh and worries about his own LMF. In his need to prove his courage, Ernest\u2019s wavering leads to all kind of dangerous complications for Peggy and Henryk, who meanwhile are finding themselves attracted to each other.That Burning Summer is told from the alternating points of view of Peggy, Henryk, and Ernest. It begins with a copy of the leaflet from the War Office, and each of the seven chapter begins with the instructions of what to do in case of an invasion, instructions that are reflected in Ernest\u2019s struggles with his fears of an invasion, his own possible lack of courage, and later with his feelings about Henryk. I though Syson did a masterful job of weaving each instruction into the unfolding of Ernest's story without making it sound forced.But this is really Peggy\u2019s coming of age story. Unlike her friend, Peggy doesn't really have feelings about boys, and certainly not about her own sexuality. Readers watch as she discovers her developing feelings for Henryk, and becomes aware of her budding sexuality. Besides the coming of age theme That Burning Summer also explores ideas of courage, cowardice, family, and loyalty in all her characters.It is not a well-known fact that many Polish pilots flew for the RAF after their country was invaded and Syson brings how it came about nicely as Henryk's story unfolds. In addition, Syson includes interesting everyday details about wartime life in a small village, and a sub-story about where Peggy and Ernest\u2019s father really is and why, along with a mystery as to who is sending cruel notes to their Mum. Another sub-story concerns an opportunistic bully who seems to know just how to get under Ernest\u2019s skin, adding realism and depth to the novel. The novel really only covers the events of the summer and early fall of 1940, but there is also an epilogue set in 1946 that brings readers up-to-date with Peggy and Henryk's fate. That Burning Summer is a historical fiction novel that should appeal to readers who are interested in WWII, and especially those who also like a touch of romance.

The characters were all over the place and not really believable at all- sure they're around the time puberty hits but it definitely didn't explain their odd behaviours sometimes. It didnt feel like there was even a real climax to the story, and when the \"grand finale\" of the story occurred, it was out of no where, not actually contributing to the story up until those last like 4 chapters. And there is no explanation as to why this family is living at their uncle's farm other than it has something to do with their father which honestly could have been explained much sooner rather than be used for a shitty \"plot twist\".The romance was barely there, very cheesy, and didn't feel like it should have been happening?

That Burning SummerWith that amazing title and a synopsis that strongly hints of a secret wartime love affair, you'd be forgiven for thinking that this book is an out-and-out romance. Ok, it is a bit of an out-and-out romance, but as much as I adored this particular relationship and the mammoth objects put in its path, the thing I took away was a different sort of fire - having the strength to cope with the day-to-day realities during some of the most difficult and tense events in history.As with her previous book, Syson's writing takes a particular point and place in the past and opens it up in a way I don't think I've come across in YA before. All the research and attention to detail is evident, yet it never feels like you're sitting through a history lesson. Or maybe just like you're experiencing the best history lesson ever. This book not only sheds light on the contribution of Polish pilots to the war effort, but also the story of those who chose to stand by their pacifist principles in the face of overwhelming pressure and the ripple effects this had on their families. I was initially a bit apprehensive about the large part Peggy's younger brother Ernest appeared to be playing in the story ( just wanted to get to the kissing bits to be honest), but his journey and how this tallied with Henryk's experiences, ended up being my favourite part of the book. This is a tale about a different sort of war time bravery - of coping with overwhelming mental as well as physical hurdles as well as standing up for beliefs in the face of public opinion and convention. But with all the complex issues floating about, there is still a strong and powerful chemistry between Peggy and Henryk that was a joy to read. Some of the scenes actually made my page CRACKLE, I swear. As with all the best historical fiction, this provides a new perspective on a period that has been depicted on paper many, many times before. It's a very welcome addition to the growing number of YA books set during this period that I've had the pleasure to read in the last couple of years. Not only does it make you think AND swoon, but there's also does a rather good sideline in suspense too. Oh, and the cover's ace as well.

This in no way affected my opinion of the book, or the content of my review. I want to thank NetGalley for giving me the opportunity to read this book!I am loathe to do this, because the premise sounded so interesting. I loved the idea of getting to know more about a relatively undocumented portion of an extremely documented time - Polish airmen who participated in the war efforts from both French and English soil after the German Reich overtook Poland. What I ended up getting was a lot less than I would have liked - the characters all felt wooden to me; their motivations at best murky and at worst beyond my scope of care. The story is told in multiple POVs: Peggy, the 16yr old female protoganist that finds the wounded Polish airman; Henryk, the aforementioned Polish airman; and Ernest, Peggy\u2019s 12yr old brother who is obsessed with his doing his civic duty during the war. At times, this writing style helped the story; I\u2019ve always loved multiple POVs and the better understanding of each character it affords the reader. However, in this particular instance, it only made me all the more aware of the underdevelopment of each character. If you are in the search of compelling Young Adult WWII historical fiction, I would heartily recommend Code Name Verity by Elizabeth Wein, The War That Saved My Life by Kimberley Brubraker Bradley, or Between Shades of Gray by Ruta Sepetys \u2013 all three affected me profoundly as a reader."}, {"userName": "Malcolm", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5860800-malcolm", "userReview": "On England\u2019s south-east coast in 1940 things seemed perilous. Across the channel the German army prepared to invade; above the RAF battled the Luftwaffe for the skies; down below farmers struggled to keep their farms running, to feed and supply but also to make a living in a time of price fixing and purchasing, rationing and limits on all manner of things. Amid all of this teenage Peggy and her younger brother Ernest help out on their uncle\u2019s farm, while Ernest looks to do his bit for the war effort, seeing invaders most everywhere.Into this comes a crashed RAF pilot, a Pole (Henryk), who has had enough of the war, of fighting, of the constant danger. On so many fronts he causes problems for Peggy, who helps hide him in the disused local church. He is a stranger, so suspicious; he is not British, so a possible spy; he is, in the language of the time, a malingerer who stays away from base for so long (despite having been shot down) that he is absent without leave, so labelled a coward. Lydia Syson unpacks these tensions, explores all manner of other questions (\u2018fatherless\u2019 children; children shipped form the cities to the countryside for safety, away from bombing; black markets and corruption; actual spies and so much more) in a thoroughly enjoyable Young Adult historical novel.Peggy\u2019s an excellent character: savvy and resourceful; willing to make sacrifices for a moral good. Ernest is not so well developed but in many respects this Peggy and Henryk\u2019s story, a nascent romance in the midst of military and political turmoil. It\u2019s an engaging novel with real insight into an aspect of the Home Front seldom seen in YA fiction.

I love that I can happily recommend them to my students without any worries that might get completely wrong ideas about the time we are studying. That burning summer is a really interesting story of a romance that develops between a British girl and a Polish pilot who she finds honest her home after he is forced out of his plane by parachute. I really enjoyed watching their relationship develop and seeing the world through their eyes particularly in the way he worried about being treated by others. I also loved that it gave me a bit more insight into the role polish pilots played within the RAF which is something I hadn't really appreciated before. A fab read which I thoroughly enjoyed."}, {"userName": "Emma Carroll", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16047377-emma-carroll", "userReview": "I do most of my reading with my morning cuppa. When a book's a good one, I also sneak in reading time throughout the day. 'That Burning Summer' was such a book. The story premise gripped me immediately; it made me think of 'Whistle Down The Wind' - one of my favourite childhood films. The POV shifts worked well allowing characters' relationships and interactions to develop. I particularly liked Peggy. The male characters depend on her; she is practical, caring and immensely brave in dangerous circumstances. She also has a very clear sense of loyalty, which goes beyond national identity. I liked too that the background characters, her father and 'the looker', are ambiguous; they represent a different side to war. It's a given that Lydia Syson's work will be full of period detail and atmosphere. What impresses me is the richness and complexity of her characters. A brilliant read."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6654878-shannon", "userReview": "This is a really sweet story set in England during World War II.

I was really looking forward to another WWII story, but unfortunately I wasn't too convinced by this one. I'm not saying it was a bad read, but it took me a long time to get a proper feel for the story and I struggled to focus on the plot. I cannot put my finger exactly on the why though... It might have been the tone, it might have been the pace, but it just wasn't as good as I thought it would be. The premise of That Burning Summer is interesting even though I've read about characters hiding soldiers in the past. The Polish airman Henryk has an interesting background, but I felt the focus of this story was too much on the 'childish' romantic feelings between him and Peggy instead of what is happening in the war. That angle would have been much more interesting, especially since as far as I could tell the descriptions of the war are very accurate and seem well researched. Instead, both the childish feelings of Peggy for the soldier and her annoying little brother distracted from what could have been such an intriguing story. Most people seem to enjoy That Burning Summer though, so it might just have been me...It's July 1940 and the soldiers are struggling to keep the war out of England. Then one day a plane crashes in the march somewhere on the south coast of England, and it is the sixteen-year-old Peggy who finds the pilot. She is supposed to report the event, but Peggy feels for the young Polish airman who is\u00a0afraid to return to the fight. She decides to help him find a place to hide, and leads him to a remote and abandoned church. Peggy knows what she is doing is illegal and tries to keep it a secret... But it is turning out to be really hard to hide a soldier when her\u00a0younger brother follows her everywhere and she has to steal food at home to feed him.I really wanted to enjoy That Burning Summer, but unfortunately my experience wasn't as positive as I thought it would be. I'm having a hard time putting my finger exactly on the way, but I'm quite sure the 'childish' romance scenes and slow pace did have a lot to do with. The historical elements are great though and it's nice to see a Polish airman playing such a big role in this story.

Peggy finds downed Polish pilot Henryk and hides him in a church because he is weary of war and doesn't want to go back. Peggy and Henryk become friends, and he tells her of his sisters home in Poland.Peggy, Ernest, and Henryk all share a summer that will change their lives forever.This is a story told from three alternating points of view as it followed each of the main characters, which I really enjoyed because I felt like it really helped me to understand each of the characters. This book is well planned in that it has fast paced, short in length chapters that really kept the pace clipping along, which I enjoyed.Peggy is a compassionate young woman, with a big heart, she sees Henryk and knows that she wants to help him, and heal his hurt. Henryk and Peggy don't let language be a barrier for them as they get to know each other and find in each other a kindred spirit. Ernest desperately wants to be of service to make his family proud of him, but he is often conflicted, with everyone telling him what to do, and what he should do. But he is clever and quick witted. I liked this book, it explores coming of age in wartime, and the many conflicting emotions that come when things aren't always black and white. Sometimes the descriptions would take me surprise, perhaps because of their rawness and how fitting it was, or other times sort of disrupted the flow, I don't know why it struck me that way, and it could be a personal thing.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention it on my blog.

After the first couple chapters, it settled into a relaxing rotation of fast- and slow-paced sections. The plot itself seemed a little scattered sometimes. I feel like the scattered and hard-to-follow plot and writing were deliberate. It was not wholly satisfying at the end but again, I think that was deliberate.I liked Peggy. I didn't love her, but I liked her. It did seem like she fell in love with Henryk too fast. Henryk was intriguing. I enjoyed the glimpses into his life in Poland. At first it seems like he's afraid to excess, but then you see what happened to his family and it's understandable. It even endeared him to me. Ernest was very bent on following the rules and doing what he thought was right without asking anyone's advice, sometimes with nearly disastrous results. He seemed older than twelve a lot of the time. Ernest was my favourite character.Based on my evaluation of the plot, it might seem that I wouldn't have enjoyed this book as much as I did, but I actually found myself liking the writing style. I spent an entire afternoon reading That Burning Summer that I should've spent doing things that needed to be done! This was a riveting novel covering a topic that isn't seen much in fiction: the Poles who fought for Britain in WWII.

Here we meet Peggy, who's living in the countryside of England, and a young Polish pilot Henryk, who is on the run from the war, having crashed his plane nearby. Peggy helps Henryk find a place to hide so he doesn't have to go back, and we watch as their relationship blooms. We also get to explore Henryk's history within the war and his fear of going back to see more death, his reason for deserting the British Air Force. There are many elements to this story: betrayal, love, and a bit of action towards the end; switching constantly between the perspectives of Henryk, Peggy, and Ernest (Peggy's younger brother).Altogether, I want to grant this book 3 1/2 stars, because I did quite enjoy it, especially as a fan of anything based around the second world war. To me though, it seemed to drag quite a bit, and had many elements that I could predict happening, but there were many things that I didn't expect at the same time, so it had a nice balance. And thankfully it had the right amount of the love too, seeing as I'm not huge on romance novels. This one doesn't touch on it too much, but you can still feel the love between the two.

It had so much potential. A small English town on the South coast, a plane that crashed and a young woman who finds its broken pilot. She helps him to hide, and slowly but surely she discovers the story behind the Polish pilot. With a younger brother who is coming with terms with the war, Peggy and Ernest are inseparable, and the two hide the secret of the fallen pilot. Personally this book dragged a bit for me, and the ending felt completely rushed. There was parts where even though the author was dealing with a fascinating story line, I was bored and waiting for something to happen. The whole book felt that way. Another thing that really bothered me was the fact that the relationship between the two potential lovers felt forced. I am sure that there are a lot of people who would like this book, sadly for me, it won\u2019t be on my list of favourites."}], "description": "It\u2019s July 1940 on the south coast of England.
