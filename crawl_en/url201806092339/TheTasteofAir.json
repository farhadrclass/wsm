Not only is her mother's health a real concern for Nell but just why in the world was her mother even in Vermont is the big question, Mary was supposed to be in an assisted-living facility in Massachusetts.When Nell arrives in Vermont she finds that her mother has had a secret life that no one in the family had known about. Mary owns a small cabin and it seems that she has had the place for years, even before Nell's father had passed away. Now while waiting for news of her mother's health Nell needs to piece together this secret life that her mother had been living. The Taste of Air was a fantastic contemporary read that almost had a bit of a thriller edge to it when it came down to unwinding years and years worth of family secrets. The story alternates between the current day and the past leading the reader to find out what exactly Mary had been hiding from her closest family for years. Not only did Mary have her secrets for Nell to uncover but the book touches upon Nell's own self discovery along with other characters during the read. It was quite intriguing and had the pages turning all throughout watching the characters grow and find themselves right along with solving the mystery of the small lakeside cottage that Mary had kept and why she hadn't even told her daughters. Definitely a compelling read for those that enjoy more of a family drama and secrets spanning decades unfolding before your eyes, one that I'd highly recommend.

This story gets a solid four stars for being engaging and causing the reader to want to hurry to the end and bring meaning and closure to the mystery. A mother, Mary, has taken ill and lands in an ICU ward in a hospital in Vermont. Her youngest daughter, Nell, gets a phone call saying her mother is in the hospital and has named Nell as her health proxy. Nell assumes her mother is in a hospital in Massachusetts, where she lives, only to be shocked to find she is in Vermont. She leaves her two children in the care of her husband and rushes to Vermont only to find her mother nearly comatose and also discovers her mother wasn\u2019t just visiting Vermont, she owns a cottage there. In fact, she has owned it for many years \u2013 even when Nell was a young girl. The older daughter, Bridgett, arrives soon carrying some heavy luggage \u2013 and not just the kind you pack in a suitcase. Both begin a journey to uncover the life of their mother they never knew. The story line was interesting and, for the most part, well written, but it gets only three stars for presenting a scenario that this reader found a bit too unbelievable. Some secrets can be easily hid, other can be covered up enough that no one realizes what they are seeing, but owning a house for years and years with frequent visits and your husband and children never catch a whiff of it, stretched the boundaries a bit too far for me. There are just too many items involved in owning a home (taxes, insurance, repairs, utilities, etc.) that one spouse would be able to hide those expenses from the other spouse. If you put aside the things I found difficult to swallow, it was still a moving story of the things a mother does for love, the sacrifices a mother makes and the importance of not losing yourself in the mix."}, {"userName": "Leslie aka StoreyBook Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272944-leslie-aka-storeybook-reviews", "userReview": "Life is too short to not enjoy life and those around you.

It is also a journey of self-discovery for each of these women.This book jumps back and forth in time, revealing snippets of history that tie the story together in the end. As you read further into the book you might figure some of it out before it is officially revealed, but the anticipation in waiting for the truth to be revealed had me on the edge of my seat.

The Taste of Air by Gail Cleare caught my attention from the moment I began to read it. What begins to unfold from page one is a captivating story filled with mystery, suspense, love, longing and family. As I write this review and begin to relive the story once again, my eyes are filling with tears. This is a book that I have told many people about already, recommending it to all of the book lovers in my life, because I have the hope that it will stay with them like it did with me. The writing was emotional, the scenery imaginative, and each plot point revealed mesmerizing. From beginning to end, I was wrapped up in this story and I found myself trying to prolong the ending, not wanting the story to close, but finding myself far too curious to leave this down for long.The story of two sisters and their mother that unraveled throughout this novel was actually breathtaking at moments. From love and war to secrets ready to be uncovered, each little piece played a pivotal part in how this entire book came together. It was wonderful watching the personal journeys of Nell and Bridget, two very different sisters yet alike in so many ways also, as they tried to find their own happiness amidst their mother\u2019s sudden illness. Their bond was a comfort to me as I read. Overall, I hope you can see that I truly loved this story. Filled with plot twists and unpredictable moments, get ready for a wild ride. I promise you it\u2019s worth it though. The Taste of Air by Gail Cleare is a poignant tale not to be missed.

It\u2019s also a heart-warming story of three women\u2019s journey towards self-discovery and leading authentic, satisfying lives. The novel is written with warmth and perception in Cleare\u2019s smooth, easy-to-read style. Also there are some wonderfully evocative descriptions of Vermont, which made me long to go there.Some themes and questions raised in the book really resonated with me, especially that of how one (a woman usually, it has to be said) can to be true to oneself despite the multitude of limitations and compromises that can arise from marriage and family life. Nell, married to David and a mother of two, is called to a hospital treating her mother Mary who has become seriously ill - only it\u2019s hundreds of miles from the elderly-friendly home where her mother is supposed to be living. Shocked by the discovery of her mother\u2019s secret getaway, a lake-side house in Vermont, Nell sets off to uncover the mystery behind the house and the reasons why her mother, who Nell thought she knew well, has been living there without telling anyone. Away from her day-to-day family life while visiting Mary in hospital, Nell installs herself in her mother\u2019s house and gets to know the people in Mary\u2019s life she never knew existed, especially Mary\u2019s neighbour and close friend Jake and his rather dishy son, who Nell clicks with straight away...The novel is told in the alternating close third person viewpoints of Nell and her sister Bridget in present day America, and Mary starting from when she is a nurse stationed in Vietnam during war in the 1960s. This past strand is skilfully woven with the present-day chapters so that the reader slowly learns the truth of the past along with Nell, and why Mary has apparently been living a double life for years. I could relate to all three female characters, especially Nell who feels somewhat trapped in her life with corporate go-getter husband David. She begins understand that she has choices to make - and she is more like her mother than she ever guessed - indeed startling parallels in their lives begin to emerge. Of the male characters I found gruff, alcohol-riddled Jake the strongest and most interesting. The author kept me guessing all through as to what was going to happen next. I was surprised at how the story panned out, which took me in a different direction to that I\u2019d been expecting. The ending I found satisfying and well resolved, emphasising the importance of family... Overall, I much enjoyed this book - I now have a fantasy of leaving the boring bits of my life behind and finding a blissful lakeside hideaway in Vermont :) I would definitely recommend The Taste of Air to readers of family life novels and women\u2019s fiction.

When Nell arrived at Hartland General Hospital, she was stunned to find out her mother owned a small cabin by the lake, and had developed the life-threatening respiratory infection while boating on the lake with a neighbor. Entering her mother\u2019s cabin left Nell unsettled and somewhat confused, wondering how many other secrets Mary Ellen had been keeping from the family. The photographs on the walls, the familiar d\u00e9cor, and their mother\u2019s personal items obviously in use left Nell and Bridget with more questions than answers. I really enjoyed this story of family love and loyalty. Mary Ellen was an incredibly strong woman caught in an impossible situation, and yet, she was able to do the right thing with grace and dignity.

Her boldness in carving out a second life for herself gives them confidence to do the same. The way in which Gail Cleare shows the closeness between the sisters is masterfully done, and I think many women would relate to the impetus to be true to themselves and forge new paths. Not so much a mid-life crisis, but a desire to be honest and pare life back to the essentials. The author also toys with expectations, such as when Bridget and Nell meet Adam and Jake. We are expecting romance, but the relationships evolve in other ways. The insights about marriage and how to be ourselves within a partnership are also very well done.

They share time together and see some pretty awful things. One thing I liked about this story is it did not go into bad gruesome details of bloody and hurt soldiers or the horrors they faced when they came home. Although it did happen. It\u2019s good to read about some of the pleasant things even though they were most likely few and far between. Jake and Mary were the best of friends and eventually Mary became best friends with Jake\u2019s wife Jennie. Mary had many secrets that her daughters would uncover in her cottage in Vermont. She had a completely separate life there from the one at home or in the assisted living facility in Massachusetts where she was suppose to be. Nell and Bridget learned a lot about their mother that they never knew. They got to know themselves much better along the way also. They uncovered some secrets that their mother kept from them and learned why. Everyone possible has some secrets they would like to keep but in Mary\u2019s case it helped her daughter to move forward learning who and what their mom was and had done. She was a wonderful lady in my opinion and in theirs too. This truly is a wonderful story that will touch your heart in so many ways. Make you feel like taking time for yourself is ok and a must sometimes. I throughly enjoyed this book from start to finish. It was so heartwarming, beautiful and touching. I cried, laughed, cringed a bit, while reading this one. It\u2019s a good must read for anyone who loves a story that will unfold chapter by chapter. It is told from Mary/Ellie, Nell and Bridget\u2019s lives. Not in the least hard to follow. It will leave you feeling happy. It did me.I loved it and gave it a big 5 stars. Well written, great characters and beautiful scenery."}], "description": "USA TODAY BESTSELLERA simple phone call disrupts Nell Williams\u2019s well-ordered life.
