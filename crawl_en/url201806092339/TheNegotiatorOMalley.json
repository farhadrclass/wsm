Even before we got to the proselytizing the characters were just a bit too perfect; all of them very successful at what they did. Then comes the fact that the hero would not even consider dating the heroine (Kate) because she was not a Christian. This was the first turn off. When her sister was diagnosed with cancer and told Kate she was afraid for her soul, I just wanted to puke. Do evangelical Christians not realize just how arrogant this is? I labored on because I hate not to finish a book. At about 75% I just gave up. I do not appreciate proselytizing in my real life and I certainly do not want to read about it. Those who loved this book probably think this is they way to get people hooked. For many out there it has just the opposite effect. Even though I was baptized when I was 10 years old, I have had too many people want to \"bring me to Jesus\" because my church wasn't the \"right\" one. I finally withdrew from organized religion and homechurched. I realize this book is geared toward those who are avid believers and evangelicals and they feel it is their Christian duty to share the word. However, for those of us who feel religion is very personal, it is a huge turn-off from organized religion. These type of books just reinforce the tactics used by evangelicals which in my opinion are extremely counterproductive."}, {"userName": "Sarah Grace", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59507807-sarah-grace", "userReview": "That was so good!

Really, I did. But I couldn't get past the totally unrealistic characters. Could there really be that many perfect, gorgeous, intelligent, rich, single, patriotic career professionals (with high-paying, exciting careers) all in one \"family\"? Throw in a mansion and a private jet owned by a studly FBI love interest (with an alluring British accent of all things), some intrigue and romance and it was just a little \"over the top\" for me. I just couldn't relate to the characters at all. On the plus side, I did appreciate the author attempting to put a spiritual message in the book and weighing in on the paradox of God's mercy vs. justice. It seemed a bit \"forced\" though. I did finish the book because there was enough mystery to keep me wondering \"whodunit.\" The book was \"okay\" but I don't know that I will bother with more in the series. I know this book was rated highly by others so I hate to say it but maybe it's \"just me\" or the mood I'm currently in.

It was something different from what I\u2019ve recently been reading, but so so good. I need the next one!Kate O\u2019Malley is a hostage negotiator. Whether defusing human time bombs or stopping stopping a person from jumping off a building, she is good at what she does and will walk into situations no one else will. Dave Richman is a FBI special agent who has spent much of his life protecting people. He is starting to care about Kate. But now someone is targeting her. Someone who is not just out for her blood, but who wants to ruin her first. A person has sent her black roses. Maybe the same one that blew up an airplane and blamed her. Dave is determined to protect her. If he can\u2019t, she may die. When shocking evidence from the investigation threatens to crush her, can she learn to rely and trust in Dave and the God he believes in so faithfully?I loved this book a lot. I connected with Dave and Kate right from the start. They were so fun to read about. I mean they were hilarious together and the budding romance was so sweet. Though I do think the Dave fell in love with Kate a bit too quickly. Kate was a really strong character. She could hide her emotions very well in almost every situation she was in, but she had a temper that she let out at points. Dave was kind and very protective, though he had a touch of cockiness and a lot of fun which was perfect. Then the whole O\u2019Malley family, don\u2019t get me started. I could laugh at most of the parts with all of them together. The protective brothers, the awesome sisters, is was cool. Marcus is my favorite of the siblings, I think. They were all good. This book was layered with puns and jokes from all of them including Dave.The plot was intense. The mysteries, the secrets, it all added to such a great thrilling suspense. It will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the book. I did feel like the climatic ending could have been drawn out a little bit more than it was, since there was so much anticipation leading up to it. But it was still great.I\u2019ll recommend this to teens and up. This was a great Christian Fiction book with so much suspense, mystery, and romance. If you like any sort of Christian Fiction, try it out! I think you\u2019ll find it very good.You can check out this review on my blog too, at: https://aheartredeemed.wordpress.com/...

I thought Henderson did a good job weaving in enough suspense about Kate's background and the other elements to keep the plot snappy and quick moving...until about 2/3 of the way through when it felt like everything got tangled up in details and I started having trouble following the case and who was doing what at what time. And then there's the moment when Kate makes a big breakthrough in the case. We've been following the characters through this case detail by excruciating detail, and suddenly we skip 3 days and Kate has figured it out!Anyway, my real problem with this book - which, really, was OK in the end - was the result of a bunch of little things. First, it was a little unbelievable that every beautiful, feisty member of the O'Malley \"family\" (which I guess I can let slide since they're each the main character of a romance in this O'Malley series) is at the top of their career field and that they are all in jobs that are, in essence, very similar: a negotiator, a US marshal, a firefighter, a nurse, a pediatrician... You get the picture. I loved that Kate was a kick-ass, strong female negotiator who plays basketball to unwind from the stress of her job. But it got to be a bit much when each one of her siblings is just the same.Also, what in the world was with Kate's southern accent?! Even though she's from Chicago, she goes in and out of a Southern accent. Why?! And then apparently Dave has a British accent but he's still a US FBI officer and his family has owned an estate outside of Chicago for generations? AND Henderson didn't ever change the way the dialogue was written to account for these accents, she just kind of told you they had them and then moved on. So it was just little stuff like that that kind of built up and kind of took away from the book as a whole.The other problem is that I'm not a reader of Christian fiction, and I read this specifically because it was Christian fiction for a class. And while I appreciated the fact that Kate is a nonbeliever and rationally questions the existence of God, I kind of got a little squirmy when Dave and his sister discuss the best way that he can go about converting Kate via \"friendship evangelism.\" And then Kate's final conversion felt a little...forced. Especially the statement, mere seconds after she allows herself to believe, that she has to go and convert the rest of her siblings. Because she obviously knows what's best for them now. It just got a little preachy at times."}, {"userName": "Ebookwormy1", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1005834-ebookwormy1", "userReview": "This work has some bright spots, mostly plotting in the second half. Other strong points are the character development of the O'Malley family members. The author does a good job of introducing the cast without belaboring the story (which is focused on Kate). Also, the author demonstrates knowledge of the police/ FBI etc. structure and procedures. There were so many reasons I WANTED to like this book.However, there are significant weaknesses here. The most blatant of which is that Kate is supposed to be speaking with a southern accent, and Dave is supposed to be speaking with a British accent. Henderson needs to realize that word choice, tempo and enunciation are also part of accent, not just merely telling the reader they are speaking differently. Wooden dialogue, incomplete setting of scenes (pretty problematic in a book dealing with crime), repetition of the same words within a page, and confusion about the timing of a significant incident (starts off Mon, then people start talking about \"what happened on Tuesday, and finally in the last part of the book, it is a \"Thursday!\") all contribute to a convoluted reading experience. I had to read some parts a couple of times before I could go on. Finally, the author is just a little bit too much in love with her characters. All the O'Malleys are flawless, gifted, top of their profession people. Numerous times, their paths in negotiator, fireman, US marshall, doctor, counselor, cross. This lack of realism may have been forgiven were it not for the final incident in which \"boyfriend\" is allowed into a negotiation. I don't care if he works for the FBI and has a strong personal interest in protecting the negotiator (whose reasons for being there were also thin, but plausible). I highly doubt such a situation would be permitted in real life.Certainly these blunders are the fault of the author, yet one wonders, \"where are the editors\"? A rigorous editorial process/ review should have been able to address many of the flaws. Of course, maybe a rigorous review did take place? In that case, one wonders if the effort to pull a good final product from the author is worth the publisher's resources. While the content has promise, I would be embarrassed to publish this book in it's current form.I have two other books in this series from the library. Whether or not I will be able to overcome this first installment remains to be seen... After thinking about this for about 1/2 hour while perusing Goodreads, I have decided \"no\", I'm not going to read anymore of this series. There are so many BRILLIANT books I would rather enjoy."}, {"userName": "Bark", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2905339-bark", "userReview": "Within the pages of The Negotiator you'll find a nail biting, well developed suspense, a sweet and equally well developed relationship and some fine secondary characters.

The book had great pacing. I thoroughly enjoyed the \"Die Hard\" action / suspense parts of this book. And let it be noted, the author did her research. Henderson masterfully weaves together realistic technical details, mystery, suspense and romance into one intriguing story. We get a very realistic understanding of the interaction and partnership between law-enforcement, EMS, and other civil protectors - and moreover, the unique human bond created by those who suffer adversity together.Did you notice the mention of romance? Yep, it's in there. Despite the fact that I questioned the ease with which Dave (an FBI agent involved in the opening scene) and Kate get together, I likened their relationship to that of the fictional characters played by Richard Gere and Julia Roberts in \"Pretty Woman\". Since I'm sucker for a good falling-in-love story, it worked for me.Lastly, and most importantly, the subtle golden thread running through this story; Kate\u2019s personal spiritual journey. Oftentimes these types of things are portrayed in a sappy ultra-dramatic, bizarre, or harsh pushy manner. In this book it is quieter and simpler; yet no less profound and wondrous. It is, in a word, real - down to Earth. I really appreciated that. I give this book five stars, and intend to read all the books in this series."}, {"userName": "Angela R.

As the main character she is a complex, exciting character. She has her head on her shoulders and can think calmly in the most stressful of situations, that's what makes her so good at her job...negotiating, keeping people safe. But she has a past. She comes from an abusive family and at a young age she was placed in an orphanage at Trevor House. This is where the O'Malleys meet and decide to make their own family. They stick by eachother like none other. Also Sara and Dave from the previous book Danger in the Shadows make a very prominent appearance and I loved meeting them again. Negotiator is fast paced and gets the heart racing and yet at just the right places it has humor that give you that breathing space that is so needed in books like this. In this book we find Kate O'Malley in a situation where a plane has a bomb in it and her name is specifically brought into it by the caller who reports the bomb. From here the story explodes into action and takes your breath away. It makes you turn the page (or click for the next page) to find out who the culprit is. There are twists that are unexpected.

The character of Kate is so excellently dynamic and really what makes her book special. I find her job as a hostage negotiator fascinating. She's independent. She has nerves of steel, yet as the reader you also get to see her deepest emotions. That's what makes you love her.The external drama is used to enhance the internal drama. Dave gets to see Kate at her weakest due to sheer bad timing. Kate's struggle with faith is also made more challenging.

Reading the blurb and first chapter, I had no idea that the story would pan out like it did. I would best describe this book as having \u201cabsorbed me\u201d and I\u2019ve found it rare for fictional books to have that level of effect on me. \ud83d\ude04Dee Henderson writes in a way that just makes it a pleasure to read. In fact, most times I didn\u2019t feel like I was reading, but observing. The characters were so alive and I found myself so interested in their lives. However, it was a bit disappointing that the characters and their situations weren\u2019t more realistic. There\u2019s no mistaking that it\u2019s fiction, that\u2019s for sure.Kate and Dave have great dynamics and it\u2019s so enjoyable to read them having their witty conversations.I was unaware as I read this book (#1 to the O\u2019Malley series) that there was a #0.5 instalment which precedes this one, about Sara, Dave\u2019s sister. Without having read that background on Dave, I still feel that this book succeeded in introducing him and I felt like I knew him fairly well.I don\u2019t know what I was expecting this book to be, but it quite surprised me as I was whirled into a mystery. I haven\u2019t read many mystery books, so I don\u2019t have much to compare it to, but I imagine this is a good one. I was completely enamoured by the story.Another downside to this book was the confusion of suspects. It all worked into place in the end, but as investigations were underway and names of suspects were thrown into the mix (often names not yet mentioned) I found it easy to get lost amongst it all.Something I quite admired about this book was the fairly accurate impression of a negotiator\u2019s lifestyle. Now, I barely know anything about negotiators, but I found myself hoping that Dee didn\u2019t just brush over the impact that such a tough and mentally-draining job would have on someone\u2019s mental health. This was not overlooked and it felt real and relatable.I\u2019m so glad that this was one of the first mystery books I\u2019ve read, as I enjoyed it so much that it has given me a good opinion of mystery books.

While Kate is not a Christian, Dee Henderson has her have realistic standards for herself. Things I didn't like: 1. Dave knocked almost a whole star off this book. Why? He's protective, which is really sweet, but it was a little extreme. Also he was a little inconsistent (Believably so). He say's he can't date Kate because she's not a Christian, but he has no problem running his hands though her hair (And stuff like that), and spending all his time with her.

Instead they had this unusual 'rapport at first sight.' I enjoyed their banter and the dynamics of their relationship. The book focuses a lot on God's character, which I really enjoyed. It was great to delve into Kate's questions alongside her, and it was a good reminder of God's sovereignty and how we don't always understand why He allows certain things to happen.Kate's journey was realistic. As for Kate's personality, she was a bit too fiercely independent at first (in my opinion) but I liked that she could lean on her 'brothers'. Nobody is completely self-sufficient, we all need somebody. I liked the slight vulnerability that she showed towards the end of the book. I liked that Dave loved her but didn't compromise his beliefs. As for Dave being British, I was glad there was a British character at first, but as the book went on he didn't really seem all that British and his being British didn't really add anything to the story. Maybe his British accent was something of a novelty for Kate and was part of his appeal.The conclusion of the book was satisfying. I worked out who the bad guy was before he was revealed to be the bad guy, but rather than this spoiling it for me, I was relieved that it wasn't 'someone else' (trying desperately not to give any spoilers away here!!).The O'Malleys are a lovable bunch.
