Truth. (c) Oh, my! The sheer beauty of this novel lies in its perfectly dysfuntional characters. And when I say dysfunctional, I mean it. They are definitely at least halfway psychopathic. It affects you just like a car crash, which you don't want to look at but are forced to by that ancient part of your brain, the reptilian one, that would have you pay attention to the stuff of dangers in order to protect you in case something similar ever happens to you. So you watch, transfixed, the disturbing scenes before you. All just in case your inner reptilian needs that info for further perusal. (Or something like that, I'm sure neuroscientists will settle at some point on some or other theory). And so far, we get to enjoy our deluded heroes in all their malevolent glory. NB 28.11.2017. More review to follow. This novel can't be read in one sitting, it's like splashing in a bucket of cold water: pleasant in moderation, unhealthy when there is a sea of buckets.PS. I hated the women-switching twist. Stupid, really. Q: I\u2019m a headhunter. It\u2019s not particularly difficult. But I am king of the heap. (c)Q: THE CANDIDATE WAS terrified. ... \u2018I\u2019d like\u2026\u2019 I said with a smile. Not the open, unconditional smile that invites a complete stranger to come in from the cold, not the frivolous one. But the courteous, semi-warm smile that, according to the literature, signals the interviewer\u2019s professionalism, objectivity and analytical approach. Indeed, it is this lack of emotional commitment that causes the candidate to trust his interviewer\u2019s integrity. And as a result the candidate will in turn \u2013 according to the aforementioned literature \u2013 provide more sober, objective information, as he has been made to feel that any pretence would be seen through, any exaggeration exposed and ploys punished. I don\u2019t put on this smile because of the literature, though. I don\u2019t give a damn about the literature; it is chock-a-block with various degrees of authoritative bullshit, and the only thing I need is Inbau, Reid and Buckley\u2019s nine-step interrogation model. No, I put on this smile because I really am professional, objective and analytical. I am a headhunter. It is not that difficult, but I am king of the heap. (c) At this point I can't help imagining the personality of a person, a guy at that (no makup staring into the mirror, sorry, guys!), who would have trained to smile the specific kinds of smile. And catalogue them afterwards!Q: A bit young for the job. And he knew; that was why he had dyed the hair around his temples an almost imperceptible grey. I had seen this before. I had seen everything before. I had seen applicants afflicted with sweaty palms arrive with chalk in their right-hand jacket pocket so as to give me the driest and whitest handshake imaginable. (c)Q:The confusion on his face was as expected. I had been inconsistent. Balanced life. Need for Commitment. That didn\u2019t add up. Four seconds passed before he answered. Which is at least one too many. (c) Yeah, counting seconds. Nice.Q: \u2018I would certainly hope so,\u2019 he said.Secure, practised smile. But not practised enough. Not for me. He had used my own words against me, and I would have registered that as a plus if there had been some intentional irony. In this case, unfortunately, it had merely been the unconscious aping of words used by someone considered superior in status. Poor self-image, I jotted down. And he \u2018hoped\u2019, he didn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t give voice to anything visionary, was not a crystal-ball reader, didn\u2019t show that he was up to speed with the minimum requirement of every manager: that they must appear to be clairvoyant. Not an improviser. Not a chaos-pilot. (c) Cherry-picking at its finest. And to endorce it, you make your rules as you go and go on to punish people who don't succeed at the game.Q: I saw that had the desired effect. He was rattled. This was not the usual interview format, this was not Cut\u00e9, Disc or any of the other stupid, useless questionnaires hatched up by a motley collection of, to varying extents, tone-deaf psychologists and human resource experts who themselves had nothing to offer. I lowered my voice again. (c)Q: He jerked back in his chair. Bullseye. Naturally. (c)Q: Mayonnaise and liver paste, is that you?\u2019\u2018I understood that sort of thing was confidential,\u2019 Jeremias Lander said meekly.\u2018So it is. But my job is to map out resources. And that\u2019s what I do. (c)Q: \u2018Your qualifications, your track record, the tests and my personal impression all tell me you have what it takes. All you\u2019re missing is reputation. And the fundamental pillar in constructing a reputation is exclusivity. Applying for jobs at random undermines exclusivity. You\u2019re an executive who does not seek challenges but the challenge. The one job. And that\u2019s what you will be offered. On a silver platter.\u2019 (c)Q: I leaned forward. Opened my arms. Held up my palms. Sought his eyes. Research has proved that seventy-eight per cent of first impressions at interviews are based on body language and a mere eight per cent on what you actually say. The rest is about clothes, odours from armpits and mouth, what you have hanging on the walls. My body language was fantastic. And right now it was expressing openness and trust. ...I half closed my eyes. It was an expression my wife Diana said reminded her of a sluggish lion, a satiated lord and master. I liked that....I smiled, but not too broadly, stretched out my hand slightly before he arrived, but not too prematurely. (c) Q: He had answered without checking any form of calendar. I liked him better already. (c)Q: Ferdinand was unbelievably slapdash for a homosexual. And unbelievably homosexual for a headhunter. (c)Q: No one else but a headhunter would greet another headhunter with deference. (c) True enough. And not meant in a good way.Q: For discretion is our greatest virtue. The only one we have. Of course, the majority of our work from beginning to end is lies, of the most contemptible kind, such as when you hear me rounding off the second interview with my standard mantra: \u2018You\u2019re the man I want for this job. A job for which I not only think but know you are perfect. And that means the job is perfect for you. Believe me.\u2019Well, OK, don\u2019t believe me.(c)Q:They belonged to the service sector, to be more precise, the serving staff who tended to their wealthy husbands\u2019 needs. Had these women been lacking in intelligence, that would be one thing, but they had studied law, information technology and art history as a part of their beauty treatment, they had let Norwegian taxpayers finance years at university just so that they could end up as overqualified, stay-at-home playthings and sit here exchanging confidences about how to keep their sugar daddies suitably happy, suitably jealous and suitably on their toes. (c) Ok, this one I lave thought many times myself. Can't help it but think of wasted opportunities for our society.Q:Height also has a positive correlation with intelligence, income and popularity surveys. When I nominate someone for a top job in business, height is one of my most important criteria. Height instils respect, trust and authority. Tall people are visible, they can\u2019t hide, they are masters, all nastiness air-blasted away, they have to stand up and be counted. Short people move around in the sediment, they have a hidden plan, an agenda which revolves around the fact that they are short.Of course, this is rubbish, but when I propose a candidate for a job I don\u2019t do it because the person in question is the best but because he is the one the client will employ. I provide them with a head that is good enough, placed on the body they want. They are not qualified to judge the first; they can see the second with their own eyes. (c)Q:But if the carrot is big and orange enough, when the gross annual salary begins to approach seven figures, everyone modifies their principles. (c)Q: The truth is, of course, that the techniques prevailed long before then, that Inbau, Reid and Buckley\u2019s nine-step model merely summarised the FBI\u2019s hundred-year experience of extracting confessions from suspects. The method has shown itself to be enormously effective, on both the guilty and the innocent. After DNA technology made it possible for old cases to be re-examined, hundreds of people were found to have been wrongly imprisoned in the USA alone. Around a quarter of these wrongful convictions were based on confessions extracted by the nine-step model. That says everything about what a fantastic tool it is. (c)Q: He had read me like an open book during the interview. But how many of the pages? (c)Q: \u2018Do you really want to delete?\u2019 the phone replied.I scrutinised the alternatives. The cowardly, faithless \u2018no\u2019 and the mendacious \u2018yes\u2019. (c)The guy's wife is, uh... not only a crossover from manga. She obviously screams in bed like an airplane! Her screams even give her husband a case of tinnitus. I'm not kidding! Q: But not even a saint could scream like Diana. Diana\u2019s scream... It was a lament and an enduring moan, a tone that merely rose and fell, like a model aeroplane. So piercing that after the first act of love I had woken up with a ringing in my ears, and after three weeks of lovemaking I thought I could detect the first symptoms of tinnitus; .... (c) Romantic, huh?And the payback (you'll know what I am talking about after you read it) was wonderful! Q: I have always thought of myself as the kind of person who can think clearly in critical situations, someone who won\u2019t panic. Of course, that could be because there have never really been any situations in my life that were critical enough for me to panic. (c) Some moments of clarity induced by the shock!Q: It was a quarter past one, five hours since I had got up, and I had already managed to survive my wife\u2019s attempt on my life unscathed, dump the body of my partner in a lake, rescue said body, then alive and kicking, just to see my alive and kicking partner try to shoot me. Whereupon, with a flukey shot, I had seen to it that he became a corpse once again and I a murderer. And I was only halfway to Elverum. (c)Q:Most switchboards close down at four in Norway, most likely because the majority of the receptionists have gone home, to a sick partner according to statistics, in the country with the shortest working hours in the world, the biggest health budget and the highest proportion of sick leave. (c)Q:I had an inkling they offered rooms on an hourly basis for those who made love on a professional basis. In other words, those women who didn\u2019t have the beauty or the wit to use their bodies to acquire a house designed by Ove Bang and their own gallery in Frogner. (c)Q:Diana almost never lied. Not because she couldn\u2019t, Diana was a wonderful liar, but because she couldn\u2019t be bothered. Beautiful people don\u2019t need shells, are not obliged to learn all the defence mechanisms we others develop in order to protect ourselves against rejection and disappointment. But when women like Diana make up their minds to lie, they are thorough and efficient. Not because they are less moral than men, but because they have greater mastery of this aspect of the treachery. (c)Q: ... a woman with a relaxed relationship to prime numbers and logic. (c)Q:Since, on principle, I never start working before it is light, on this particular day I was \u2013 as on most other days \u2013 the last man to arrive in the car park outside Alfa. \u2018The first shall be last.\u2019 This is a privilege I have formulated myself and implemented, a privilege that can only be granted to the company\u2019s best headhunter. (c)Q:... waited and hoped. Perhaps it was a good start to the day after all, perhaps I could shout at an idiot. (c)Q:The other end had already been prepared for the man they would, in one and a half hours\u2019 time, happily agree would have to be Pathfinder\u2019s new CEO. The lights had been set up in such a way that he would appear at his most favourable, the chair was of the same kind as ours, but its legs were a bit longer, and I had laid out the leather briefcase I had bought for him, bearing his initials, and a gold Montblanc pen. (c)Q:There I had sat down and contemplated the autumn colours, which winter had already begun to suck from the forest beneath me, the town, the fjord and the light. The light that always presages the oncoming darkness. (c)Q:\u2018How did you know instinctively what we were utterly blind to?\u2019 asked the chairman, with a loud clearing of the throat. \u2018How can anyone be such a good judge of character?\u2019I nodded slowly. Pushed my papers five centimetres up the table. And slumped into the high-backed chair. It rocked \u2013 not too much, only a little. I looked out of the window. At the light. At the darkness that was on its way. A hundred seconds. The room was quite silent now.\u2018It\u2019s my job,\u2019 I said.

If this actually won best novel in Norway in 2008 (Norwegian Book Club Prize), it must be more a commentary on the sad state of Norwegian literature in that particular year. Although, perhaps out of sentimentality for Nesbo, I am still recommending it. A good beach or airline read. Nothing more. It pretty much relies on one plot twist, some rather unbelievable developments and collusions, not one character is likeable, and there is no real character development. I am thinking of a much more satisfying conclusion to the story that could have been, even given these shortcomings. This continues Nesbo\u2019s recent trend toward \u201cHollywood time\u201d.

I found it difficult to get past how totally ridiculous the main character was with his delusions of grandeur and then parts of the plot were just too far fetched to be readable. (the sewage scene was both disgusting and ludicrous).Things picked up once the real chase was on and Roger Brown started to use his brain and other people's guns to great effect.

The main character is a corporate headhunter who also happens to steal fine art in order to fund a lavish lifestyle. The story grabbed me from the opening with an element of intrigue, and then kept hold with its twists and consistent pace. It has to be said that many elements stretched the bounds of credibility, which may cause some readers to knock off a star or two. I\u2019ve read it so many times: \u201cwell a person wouldn\u2019t do that\u201d; \u201cwho\u2019d forgive a husband/wife after such an act of betrayal\u201d\u2026 and so on. People are complicated, and who knows what choices one would make in a given circumstance. So no marks lost for that from this reader. Credibility of action and circumstance, however, is something completely different, when all the pieces slot into place a little too neatly. Such a thing would normally make me consider downgrading but, although the events in this story were neat, they were also possible. What\u2019s more, they were very cleverly plotted; all slotting into place as the story comes to a close. As such, I found myself nodding in admiration rather than scowling with incredulity, and leaving those five stars in tact.Looking forward to my next journey into Jo Nesbo\u2019s words."}, {"userName": "Sa\u0161a", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33337122-sa-a", "userReview": "Dakle, kako je prosao moj prvi susret sa Nesb\u00f8?Vrlo dobro, mogu reci i prilicno sam zadovoljan.

My moderate rating reflects only my personal level of pleasure, in the same way that I can admire a painting such as Munch\u2019s \u201cThe Scream\u201d without wanting to dwell with it very long. Roger Brown is an effete, manipulating cad who strives to be the best as his executive headhunting agency, Alfa, in Oslo. You can\u2019t appreciating the artfulness in all the psychological tricks he uses to assure that without fail he picks the best man for the CEO positions he is well paid to fill and that his client candidates get perfectly placed in high positions. I came to see how he deserved the luxurious lifestyle he leads and his beautiful trophy wife, Diana, who runs an art gallery. That he truly loves her makes us see him as human. But such a love can prove to be an Achilles heel, and denying such a wife\u2019s desire to have a baby can have consequences.Roger\u2019s greed sows the seeds for trouble. In developing a Dutch candidate for a GPS technology company, one Clas Greve, Brown learns he owns a Reubens lost during World War 2. Because Brown lives beyond his means, he has a hobby of art theft. Is the well-crafted theft of this Reubens (revealed on the book jacket) just another bad-boy behavior we can kind of admire, or does this finally move you the reader to root for his downfall? As Greve starts taking actions against Brown, does he become the hero of the tale? With his military background as an ex-special forces soldier and an expert in advanced technologies, he is a dangerous opponent. The shadowy war between Brown and Greve takes a nasty turn when Diana becomes a pawn in the match.This was my first Nesbo and served as a good prelude to tapping into his Harry Hole detective series, which is so well respected in the vanguard of the wave of Nordic noir mysteries reaching the American shores."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5903843-matt", "userReview": "Nesb\u00f8 moves away from his police procedurals to offer this highly intriguing story that offers up excitement on par with any Harry Hole novel. Roger Brown has made a niche for himself as a corporate headhunter in Oslo's business world. While his commissions pay him well, Brown finds himself living a luxurious lifestyle; one that requires a second and more lucrative paycheque. During interviews, Brown finds himself fishing for personal information about candidates, particularly surrounding their art collections. The reader soon learns that Brown is happy to use this knowledge to steal numerous pieces and replace them with forgeries. When Brown is introduced to Clas Greve at an art gallery, they hit it off and seem destined to work together. Greve has his eye on a Norwegian technology company and hopes Brown can work his magic and place Greve in the CEO's chair. After learning that Greve possesses a rare piece of art, Brown proceeds with his plan. However, Greve may be more than Brown can handle and things soon spiral out of control, leaving Brown to scramble and try to make sense of this new reality. In a cat and mouse game that sees Brown and Greve dodging one another, the reader learns that this clash has less to do with art or headhunting, but a primal sense of survival. In this fast-paced novel that pushes the boundaries of the thriller genre, Nesb\u00f8 captivates the reader as the story progresses and the truth about both men becomes clear. Certainly a step away from the dark world of police detectives, but a novel that Nesb\u00f8 fans should not miss.Having almost completed the entire Nesb\u00f8 collection of novels (at least those gears to adults and translated into English), I can speak with some authority that there seems to be little the author cannot accomplish. This story is less 'cops and robbers' and more corporate espionage and personal headhunting. While it reminds me of another favourite author of mine, Nesb\u00f8 is able to carve out his own niche and keep the story flowing effectively. There is no point at which I could say things lagged or the ideas seemed repetitive from the other work I have read. Nesb\u00f8 knows his audience, but is also able to steer his writing in new and exciting directions. Roger Brown can be loved at some points and hated at others, never shying away from the cutthroat man that he appears to be in the opening chapters. Nesb\u00f8 fans are in for a treat when they curl up to devour this piece of fiction.Kudos Mr. Nesb\u00f8 for another wonderful story.

I will read others.This book was given to me by a friend who loved it\u2026I liked it. It is a short novel and a quick read that is well plotted and has more than a few twists and turns, most of which I did not see coming. Most of which are plausible and worked, and a few which required me to take a larger leap than I was willing to take without rolling my eyes. So I rolled my eyes and took the leap.Overall, this is a fast-paced novel, with some truly clever bits of shock and surprise that will keep you entertained. What I really like about it was the occasional bit of writing that took this text out of the realm of crime novel and gave it literary moments. Having both elements in a book can make for an excellent read. Passages like the following are an example of what I am talking about. \u201cThat we could sleep and dream in such a way that when we awoke it had disappeared, become something abstract, scenes from something that only took place in our heads, on the same level as those treacherous thoughts and fantasies that are the daily infidelity in every-even the most all-consuming-loving relationship.\u201dAs mentioned, this is my second standalone Nesbo novel, and \u201cHeadhunters\u201d has the violence and moments of human ugliness that seem to be a standard of Nesbo\u2019s works.

Things can only go up from here. Nesb\u00f8 contravenes this dictum, giving us characters we suppose are human, even though they act like no humans anyone has ever seen anywhere, and plotlines on the very, very far side of fetchedness.

Why have two or three plot twists, when you can have five or six (indeed, as usual, the last twist may have been one way-too-many). I personally thought it was more engaging before it turned into a corporate espionage thriller (i.e., when it was just about a cocky man being cuckholded by an even cockier man). I still prefer thrillers that are either 1) more connected with \"real\" issues and themes (see le Carre, Menking, Larsson, Steinhauer), or 2) are more satisfying as pure mysteries/ thrillers (i.e., they are fully believable and/or clever, without venturing into the absurd). Also, it's hard to pull off a book in which no one is likeable -- it's not impossible, it just takes a certain skill/integrity. When it fails (like here), you kind of end up with a bad taste in your mouth. Regardless, Nesbo is a better than average thriller writer, and it is an enjoyable, engaging, easy read. (3.5 range)I still think that Nesbo has some strange anal fixation! Here it continues, with a central scene revolving around a guy submerged in an outhouse while another man uses it.

Roger Brown is a corporate headhunter, and he\u2019s a master of his profession. But one career simply can\u2019t support his luxurious lifestyle and his wife\u2019s fledgling art gallery. At an art opening one night he meets Clas Greve, who is not only the perfect candidate for a major CEO job, but also, perhaps, the answer to his financial woes: Greve just so happens to mention that he owns a priceless Peter Paul Rubens painting that\u2019s been lost since World War II\u2014and Roger Brown just so happens to dabble in art theft. But when he breaks into Greve\u2019s apartment, he finds more than just the painting. And Clas Greve may turn out to be the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to Roger Brown.Perfect satire on employment agencies, corporate bullshit, corruption, and the heinous side of capitalism, all couched behind a life-changing art theft.\"Platform Shoes, darling!\" Mr Brown is a sociopathic squirt with a Napoleon complex and I loved every little knock down he received in a 'reap as you sow' way. Unlike Highsmith's Mr Ripley, Brown is detestable - he even hates dogs. The psychological unease increases when Roger decides to 'play' the Dutch psychopath Clas Greve. Twisty fun right there: Game On!The Brooch - MunchCalydonian Boar Hunt - Rubens. I smelt a double cross coming when this painting was introduced, clued by the picture's subject matter, and the mention of Curare. Chapter 14 was ludicrous and lost a star into the cesspit right there, perhaps Nesb\u00f8 became confused and thought he was writing one of his Fart Powder stories. Another fallen star for chapter 17 where we were treated to some memories of domestic violence, current violence, and a convenient wallet enables the story to carry on.So to sum up - the first dozen chapters were as engrossing as a good Robert Goddard, then slid down rapidly to a two star. I cannot recommend this.TR The Bat (Harry Hole #1) 4* The Redbreast (Harry Hole, #3)3.5* The Redeemer (Harry Hole #6) 3.5* The Snowman (Harry Hole, #7)TR The Leopard (Harry Hole #8) 5* The Son2* HeadhuntersWL Blood on SnowWL Jo Nesb\u00f8's Fart Powder Series"}, {"userName": "Evangelia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31755499-evangelia", "userReview": "*3,5 \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03ad\u03c1\u03b9\u03b1* (\u03c0\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03b9\u03ba\u03ac \u03c0\u03c1\u03ad\u03c0\u03b5\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03af\u03c3\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03bd\u03b1 \u03bc\u03c0\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b9\u03c3\u03ac \u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9\u03b1.)\u0394\u03b5\u03cd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b7 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03bf Nesbo, \u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03ac \u03b4\u03b5 \u03bd\u03bf\u03bc\u03af\u03b6\u03c9 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03ad\u03b3\u03b9\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7 \u03bd\u03b5\u03c3\u03bc\u03c0\u03bf\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1\u03ba\u03b9\u03ac. \u038a\u03c3\u03c9\u03c2 \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03ad\u03c7\u03c9 \u03b2\u03c1\u03b5\u03b9 \u03b1\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03b7 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c0\u03c9 \u03bf\u03c5\u03ac\u03bf. \u039f\u03b9 \u03ba\u03c5\u03bd\u03b7\u03b3\u03bf\u03af \u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03b1\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd \u03c9\u03c3\u03c4\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf, \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bd\u03b1 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ad\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03c7\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 \u03ad\u03ba\u03c0\u03bb\u03b7\u03be\u03b7\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03ae\u03c2 \u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ae\u03c2. \u0395\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03c1\u03cc, \u03bc\u03b5 \u03b3\u03c1\u03ae\u03b3\u03bf\u03c1\u03b7 \u03b4\u03c1\u03ac\u03c3\u03b7 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03b2\u03ac\u03b6\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03cd\u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03b1. \u0391\u03c0\u03cc \u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c6\u03c4\u03cc\u03bc\u03bf\u03c5\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b8\u03b1 \u03c0\u03ac\u03c9 \u03c3\u03c0\u03af\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03c5\u03bd\u03b5\u03c7\u03af\u03c3\u03c9, \u03c3\u03c5\u03bc\u03c0\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1\u03af\u03bd\u03c9 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bc\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ac\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b5. \u03a4\u03bf \u03ba\u03bf\u03bb\u03c0\u03ac\u03ba\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c1\u03c7\u03ae \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5 \u03bc\u03b5 \u03c4\u03b7\u03bd \u03b1\u03c0\u03bf\u03ba\u03ac\u03bb\u03c5\u03c8\u03b7 \u03b5\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03bc\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c0\u03bb\u03bf\u03ba\u03ae\u03c2, \u03ae\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd \u03ad\u03be\u03c5\u03c0\u03bd\u03b1 \u03c3\u03ba\u03b7\u03bd\u03bf\u03b8\u03b5\u03c4\u03b7\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf, \u03cc\u03c0\u03c9\u03c2 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u03bd\u03b1\u03b8\u03b5\u03ce\u03c1\u03b7\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c4\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c5\u03c0\u03cc\u03b8\u03b5\u03c3\u03b7\u03c2 \u03c3\u03c4\u03bf \u03c4\u03ad\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (\u03c0\u03b1\u03c1' \u03cc\u03bb\u03bf \u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03b5 \u03b5\u03ba\u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03bf \u03c4\u03bf \u03c3\u03b7\u03bc\u03b5\u03af\u03bf \u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b7 \u03b5\u03c0\u03b1\u03bd\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7\u03c8\u03b7). \u039c\u03bf\u03c5 \u03ba\u03ad\u03bd\u03c4\u03c1\u03b9\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b9\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03af\u03c4\u03b5\u03c1\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b5\u03bd\u03b4\u03b9\u03b1\u03c6\u03ad\u03c1\u03bf\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03af\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b1 \u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03cd + \u03c4\u03bf\u03c5 \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf\u03c5, \u03c4\u03bf \u03b3\u03b5\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b9 \u03cc\u03c4\u03b1\u03bd \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03b2\u03b1\u03b6\u03b1 \u03ba\u03ac\u03c4\u03b9 \u03c0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03c1\u03b1\u03b2\u03b7\u03b3\u03bc\u03ad\u03bd\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03ad\u03bb\u03b5\u03b3\u03b1, \u00ab\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03be\u03b5\u03b9 \u03c0\u03ce\u03c2 \u03b3\u03af\u03bd\u03b5\u03c4\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b1\u03c5\u03c4\u03cc;

Take a second look at it....creepy and clever. And so is the author Jo Nesbo. I picked up Headhunters thinking that it would feature Nesbo's recurring series character Detective Harry Hole. I started reading, realized that it wasn't and felt slightly disappointed. But I lost that feeling about 10 pages in. Nesbo has written an ingenious, intricately plotted stand alone thriller that had me hooked from start to finish. Roger Brown is a professional recruiter, a 'headhunter' if you will. He's not just one of the best, he is the best, as he'll tell you. And Roger likes having the best of everything. Sadly his salary does not quite match the lifestyle he's created for his wife and himself. So Roger dabbles....in art theft. Conveniently during his many recruitment interviews, he steers the discussion to art. His latest applicant, Clas Greve, has a piece of art that would leave Roger sitting pretty for the rest of his life. Roger breaks into Greve's home in search of the painting and finds much more than he bargained for......Nesbo's characterization of Roger is perfect - he comes across as a cocky, superior know-it-all, confident in his abilities to out think and out maneuver anyone and everyone. When Clas Greve begins to challenge Roger's abilities, a delicious game of cat and mouse is the result. The dialogue is quick, witty and darkly humourous.

And mediocre heads on tall bodies.\u201d (loc. 518)  \u201cNoble, loyal souls are often handicapped by loyalty to even the basest of individuals. Well, especially the base individuals.\u201dSynopsis:Roger Brown, the narrator of this novel is one of the best Norvegian corporate headhunters. In his humble opinion he is of course the very best. Unfortunately he is rather short (1.68 m or 5.5 feet) and let\u2019s face it, in his little world size and first impressions matter.Roger has many ways to compensate for the missing centimeters. He lives in an enormous vintage villa, he has a lovely, supermodel-thin and even quite intelligent wife (of course far higher than him), Diane, who has been given an art gallery from her loving husband. He has a mistress (of course far shorter than him), Lotte, who is a sad, suppressed, miserably lonely translator (but quite good in the sack). He has even a kind of hobby, if stealing different pieces of art and selling them on the black market can be called so. It is still not enough. He must prove himself he is the best every single day. By the way his career, no matter how profitable, simply can\u2019t support his luxurious lifestyle and the fledgling art gallery of his demanding wife. That\u2019s why for Roger stealing is as much a necessity as a thrilling hobby.One day our headhunter spots a perfect business opportunity \u2013 it is called Clas Greve, a former co-owner of HOTE, one of Dutch telecommunication and surveillance companies. Roger wants him to become a CEO of a similar company in Norway which produces sophisticated GPS devices. Everything is going so well, Clas proves to be quite willing, he even owns a Rubens masterpiece, allegedly lost since WWII. While stealing it from his unfinished apartment Roger accidentally finds out that Mr. Greve most likely screws his posh wife. With this discovery all the hell is let loose and Roger finally finds an opponent worth his own skills. Their vicious fight for supremacy will include a couple of murders and a lot of excrements.What I liked:This novel is a stand-alone, not another installment of the Harry Hole series (its first part I reviewed not so long ago) . As usual with Nesbo the plot was a rollercoaster ride\u2013 very fast, very entertaining, riveting to the end, a page-turner, nothing less. The author has a storytelling talent, there is no doubt of it.. Apart from that Nesbo's keen knowledge of human nature and sharp, dry sense of humor make this thriller far more readable than the average novel of this genre. Yes, it includes a bit of bathroom humour (be warned \u2013 no eating while reading certain scenes!) but all things considering it remained still palatable.Beside the very high amusing factor this book pushed my other buttons. It mentioned some famous paintings. It explained in a very funny way a method of recruiting and/or interrogation called Inbau, Reid and Buckley\u2019s nine step model.Ok now something about the main \"headhunter\" Roger Brown. I liked him more than I should have. Let me assure you that he is a loathsome human being, but his powerful enemies are at least as clever, opportunistic, and amoral as he is. No matter whether you sympathize with his ordeal or not, you will certainly laugh with him and even root for him from time to time. Still his adventures don\u2019t make Roger a \u201cwhite hat\u201d, not really, even though his rival is a ruthless, manipulative psychopath with special forces training.What I didn\u2019t like:The first person narrative was sometimes so misleading that almost annoying. I know in such books the first person is used in order not to reveal too much too early, keeping the readers on the edge of their seats (and accordingly our hero sometimes omits important info leaving you completely befuddled and craving for more). After a while I admit I was rather tired by all those twists, turns and fireworks, especially near the ending. I had a feeling all was happening a bit too fast, almost as if I watched one of Disney cartoons with Tom and Jerry \u2013 all action, little sense. There were many moments when I had to suspend belief and even then the plot seemed just too slick and shallow.After a while (like in the second part) I started wondering: is this one of the early Nesbo novels? Perhaps it was written with a very strict deadline hovering over the author\u2019s neck? This book definitely has a potential but, in my humble opinion, it failed to deliver. Even the baddies weren\u2019t as fully-fledged as I expected them to be. Once again it seems that, having all the necessary ingredients, the author lacked time or will to work on that one more. Small wonder this book was adapted for cinema \u2013 it isn\u2019t overly demanding and just flashy enough to interest the widest audience possible.Final verdict:If you haven\u2019t read any of Nesbo novels, you can start with this one, everything else will be only better. If you, however, have already discovered one of the Harry Hole books you can skip \u201cHeadhunters\u201d or watch the movie. It wasn\u2019t bad, not at all; it was a really decent thriller with all the necessary features and even more; just after a Harry Hole novel it seemed a bit tawdry to me. Still it kept me entertained. \n\n\n\nThe Calydonian Boar Hunt by Peter Paul Rubens"}, {"userName": "Daiva", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19637468-daiva", "userReview": "I certainly had some ups and downs with this one.

And even though you\u2019re grouse out by those descriptions you just can\u2019t seem to put a book away.Also, I got to give pros to Nesbo (without giving away any spoilers,) he did manage to explain everything at the end in a sufficient way. All things planned out perfectly. A lot of authors fail to do that (or leave gaps and questions in their stories, at times some plots doesn\u2019t even make sense,) but that\u2019s not the case with him.

He claims that he has never nominated a candidate for a job that was not, in the end, offered. So he\u2019s quite good at his game. But Roger doesn\u2019t play just one game. He lives a lavish lifestyle and his wife is a struggling gallery owner who relies on him for financial support. So Roger must supplement his income \u2013 which he does by dabbling in art theft. This is another role in which he excels.At one of the shows at his wife\u2019s gallery, Roger meets Clas Greve \u2013 an intriguing guy who happens to mention that he has a long-lost Peter Paul Rubens painting. Clas also seems perfect for a position for which Roger is searching for a top candidate. And so the game is afoot. But . . . this is not a game that Roger is used to playing, as his involvement with Clas nearly leads to Roger\u2019s demise.Roger is a terrific example of the antihero \u2013 a despicable character whom you must cheer on through his adventures. And the humor that Nesbo infuses lightens the tone of this thriller just enough without detracting from the thrills.This is a stand-alone novel not connected in any way to Nesbo\u2019s highly successful Harry Hole novels. Nevertheless, it is cleverly written and will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout \u2013 though some of Roger\u2019s situations (and the way he extracts himself from them) strain credulity.Grade: B"}, {"userName": "Vicky Ziliaskopoulou", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5953053-vicky-ziliaskopoulou", "userReview": "\u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03bc\u03c0\u03cc\u03c1\u03b5\u03c3\u03b1. \u0394\u03b5\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1 \u03b2\u03c1\u03ae\u03ba\u03b1\u03bc\u03b5. \u039a\u03ac\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c3\u03c4\u03b7\u03bd 50 \u03c3\u03b5\u03bb\u03af\u03b4\u03b1 \u03c4\u03bf \u03ac\u03c6\u03b7\u03c3\u03b1, \u03b4\u03b5\u03bd \u03c5\u03c0\u03ae\u03c1\u03c7\u03b5 \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 \u03bd\u03b1 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b9\u03b4\u03b5\u03c5\u03cc\u03bc\u03b1\u03c3\u03c4\u03b5 \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u03b3\u03ce \u03ba\u03b1\u03b9 \u03c4\u03bf \u03b2\u03b9\u03b2\u03bb\u03af\u03bf."}, {"userName": "Maya", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23315852-maya", "userReview": "Enjoyed the first third of the book - i thought the narrator was a good liar, it was fun trying to figure him out.

Protagonista este dotado de um sentido de moral completamente invulgar para o mais comum dos mortais, tornando-se mesmo, em algumas ocasi\u00f5es, merecedor de desprezo.Roger Brown \u00e9 um ca\u00e7ador de cabe\u00e7as de sucesso. Apesar de ter 1 metro e 68 cent\u00edmetros - considerada uma estatura baixa para um homem noruegu\u00eas - tem plena confian\u00e7a em si mesmo e nas suas capacidades. \u00c9 terrivelmente inteligente, perigosamente sedutor e extremamente calculista. Aquilo que mais ama e estima na sua vida, depois da sua mulher, \u00e9 o seu cabelo. Posso dizer que possui uma auto-estima que se aproxima do limite m\u00e1ximo imagin\u00e1vel.Jo Nesbo apresenta-nos um protagonista amoral que tem tudo o que algu\u00e9m pode desejar: um emprego mais do que bem remunerado, uma mulher lind\u00edssima que tem muito mais que apenas apar\u00eancia, uma galeria de arte frequentada por pessoas pertencentes a elite - a nata da sociedade - e uma mans\u00e3o de luxo, cujos custos est\u00e3o muito aqu\u00e9m das suas possibilidades financeiras. Roger Brown revela-nos, desde a primeira frase do livro, a sua faceta mais desagrad\u00e1vel e manipuladora. \u00c9 uma figura imponente e todos os que o rodeiam o respeitam pela sua grandiosidade e influ\u00eancia.Jo Nesbo n\u00e3o criou uma personagem principal para agradar ao leitor. Roger Brown n\u00e3o pode ser descrito como uma pessoa comum e, definitivamente, n\u00e3o tem atitudes dignas de admira\u00e7\u00e3o ou respeito. Contudo posso-vos dizer que, at\u00e9 \u00e0 \u00faltima p\u00e1gina, torci por ele e pelos seus objectivos.A obra \"Ca\u00e7adores de Cabe\u00e7as\" retrata uma hist\u00f3ria fascinante, original e digna de toda a nossa aten\u00e7\u00e3o. O enredo \u00e9 composto por tr\u00eas personagens principais, todas elas realistas, perturbadoras e emocionalmente interessantes. Entre elas destaca-se o nosso protagonista, Roger Brown, o narrador dos acontecimentos, que h\u00e1 medida que o livro avan\u00e7a, se v\u00e3o tornando cada vez mais incr\u00edveis. Com um acesso ilimitado e privilegiado aos pensamentos do ca\u00e7ador de cabe\u00e7as, vemos a sua vida perfeita a caminhar para o caos.Jo Nesbo possui um sentido de humor perspicaz e conhece verdadeiramente a natureza humana, como podemos verificar ao longo deste thriller. Apesar de n\u00e3o ser uma apreciadora de arte ass\u00eddua, nem de ter conhecimentos aprofundados sobre o assunto, gostei das refer\u00eancias a quadros e artistas famosos ao longo do livro (sobre os quais o tradutor deu mais detalhes em nota de rodap\u00e9). Um aspecto que me fascinou foi um modelo de t\u00e9cnicas de interrogat\u00f3rio que nos \u00e9 explicado desde o inicio e mencionado v\u00e1rias vezes durante toda a obra: o modelo, de nove passos, de Inbau, Reid e Buckley. Ap\u00f3s a leitura do livro fiquei a saber que este modelo existe na realidade. Roger Brown domina estas t\u00e9cnicas na perfei\u00e7\u00e3o e, n\u00e3o querendo revelar muito sobre o livro, vou apenas dizer que s\u00e3o mais do que eficazes e revelam-se extremamente \u00fateis nas situa\u00e7\u00f5es mais variadas.O fabuloso escritor noruegu\u00eas leva o seu tempo a descrever as personagens, a situa\u00e7\u00e3o e o todo o meio que os envolve. Dando-nos um falso sentimento de seguran\u00e7a, Jo Nesbo, prepara o terreno onde ir\u00e1 ter lugar a verdadeira ac\u00e7\u00e3o.O livro cativou-me desde a primeira linha. A hist\u00f3ria tem um bom ritmo, que acelera \u00e0 medida que viramos as p\u00e1ginas.
