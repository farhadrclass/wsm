In the alphabet there are 26 letters. Those 26 letters get mashed about or organised, which ever way you look at it and form words. Words then form sentences. They form paragraphs. They form stories. In fact they form everything. Think about it, there is always a word for whatever you're feeling, experiencing, seeing. Whether you can think of that word straight away or you have to sit with your feelings there is always a word. Formed simply, from those 26 letters. I've sat a while and tried to think of the best word, the one word that will capture everything I want to say. I've tried mashing and organising those 26 letters into something, anything. And the only thing I can come up with is PHENOMENAL. My skin, my blood, my heart and soul are ALIVE. From around 19% when the tingles started to now, while I sit here with tears streaming down my face, I feel ALIVE. Ego Maniac was perfectly poignant, breathtakingly beautiful and sinfully sexy.Just before hitting the halfway mark I realised that this book was my new Vi Keeland favourite. Every time I read a new Vi book I sit and say \u201cOh this is my favourite Vi Keeland book yet\u201d, but the thing is Vi\u2019s books get better and better each and every time, how can it not become my favourite?CONSUMED. With love. That's what I am. CAPTIVATED by a stunning, raw, powerful read. BUZZING from head to toe, NEEDY, from some of the most SPECTACULAR feels, probably ever. I have fallen HEAD OVER HEELS IN LOVE with Drew Jagger. The six foot two and a half, two hundred and five pounds ego Maniac pushed all my buttons, stole my breath and overtook all my senses. The cocky, arrogance oozed from Drew and I inhaled every last drop of it.Drew Jagger can literally show me his moves ANY DAY of the week. He can also sweet talk me any which way. I'm pretty sure my knees went weak as often as Emerie\u2019s. Speaking of Emerie, the sexy, sassy redhead is now my favourite Vi Keeland heroine. She made me laugh, she made me feel. I believed every single ounce of her charm and connection to Drew. And my gosh, that connection. HOT, RAW, PASSIONATE. I felt every sizzle, every spark, every intense pull. It took me 5 hours to devour Ego Maniac, and if you ask me that was way too short. I hit the end way too soon, I could easily stay in the world of Drew and Emerie forever. Because somewhere between the fighting and the clothes-ripping angry sex, I have fallen madly in love with an Ego Maniac and his fiery, Oklahoma girl. And it turned out to be exactly what I needed.Fantastic and FLAWLESS. Ego Maniac brings all the feels and more. No amount of stars will EVER correctly rate this novel."}, {"userName": "Angie - Angie's Dreamy Reads", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8524618-angie---angie-s-dreamy-reads", "userReview": "I don\u2019t share things that are mine.\u201d\n <<---- ***melts all over the place***Okay! Okay!!! Okayyyyyyyyy!!!!!!!!! Consider me smitten, charmed, seduced, and utterly romanced by this story, by these characters. Hands down one of the sweetest, most enjoyable, most heartfelt and well crafted reads I've read. The novel is laid out in such a way that you are drawn in from the first chapter to the last. I swear, there's no way that you won't like this book. NO-FREAKING-WAY! I'M. DEAD. SERIOUS. I CANNOT imagine a single person not falling head over heels in love with Emerie and Drew. They are down right lovable, so real and funny. And SO charming. SOOOOOO, SO, CHARMING. Really, Egomaniac hit my square in the gut with feels. And right now, I'm in that \"head in the clouds, hearts in my eyes, honeymoon love\" stage. I really think this novel has cemented my love of Vi Keeland as one of my FAVORITE authors. I mean.. I haven't read all of her books, but I definitely adored THE BALLER, almost had a mental meltdown over the perfection that was STUCK UP SUIT (she co-authors that with Penelope Ward) and really enjoyed BOSSMAN. And now there's this? ANOTHER WINNER. Another story that's not just sex, but actual story with pure heart and full bodied characters that are such a delight to read, they make you want to skip around in joy. It's the freaking best. ALSO, I need to say, I have a MAJOR freaking crush on Vi's writing. I'm so enamored with it. It's crisp and clean, not weighed down with a thousand bullshit details you don't give a fudge about. She doesn't over do it on character mannerisms. She lets the dialogue set the tone, and allows the reader to set the scene with their imagination. She's an author who conveys exactly what she needs to, at exactly the right time, to get the story right. Man, I'm smitten. Smitten by all of it. The writing. The sweetness of Emerie. The Perfection of Drew. Separately these characters are fantastic. Heart stopping. But together, they're CATACLYSMIC. Their chemistry owns the pages, and their strangers, to friends, to lovers story takes your breath away. From their first meeting, you fall hard for Drew, and for Emerie. They have an instant rapport that sets you at ease, and the start of the first chapters are so captivating and wholly unique. In all the time I've been reading, I don't think I've ever read a book that starts as well as that. I can't say enough good things. I just loved the dynamic between these characters, the way their attraction and friendship bloomed. From the moment Drew finds Emerie in his office, he as smitten with her as I am with them. It's sweet. There are so many unbelievably endearing moments, moments where I literally felt my heart staggering, where my cheeks hurt from smiling, and my chest filled with so much warmth and happiness. So good. Just so very good. Egomaniac is lighter on the angst, heavy on the romance and absolutely loaded with a hardy dose of pure heart you will love. I certainly think that Vi Keeland has out done herself. And I know it's early, but I'm 99% sure that this book will be in my TOP 10 at the end of 2017. I'm so in love. And I plan to scream this to anyone who will listen. A. MUST. READ.10 STARS 10 BEST OF THE BEST stars.  ******** \nOh, and PS:\n I didn't go into the outline of the book in this review, because most of the first bit of this novel is in the blurb. You really DO NOT need to know more than what's in the blurb. Go into this book and enjoy it. It's fantastic. The characters are wonderful. Also, here are just a couple of my status updates while reading. LOL. 1. 5% and I HAVE TINGLESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! That was one of the best opening scenes! Gah! #swoons2. Okay. I'm in motherfreaking love. Wow! Omg! I'm just loving this story! I feel freaking giddy right now! This ROCKS.3. OH MYGOD!That's the sweetest thing I've ever read!

Vi Keeland has once again slayed the book world as she brings forth one romance that will have readers begging for Drew Jagger and his dirty-talking mouth. Yes, panties will be dripping wet and hearts will be fluttering with butterflies.\nIt\u2019s no secret that I am a huge Vi Keeland fan but there was just something about Egomaniac that made this book stand out from the rest. With her sinful and steamy prose, Vi captured our hearts with her charismatic and relatable characters. She showcased a love story that was a symphony of heat, passion, and raw vulnerability.Drew Jagger is a successful family law attorney. Yeah, he is one of those big shot NYC divorce attorneys that means business. And so when he comes back from his Hawaiian vacation, he is surprised to discover a gorgeous redheaded woman in his office floor. As it turns out, this stranger happened to get conned into renting an office that wasn't supposed to be rented out. And so feeling bad for Emerie Rose, he decides to help her out sort of the mess and file a police report.\nAnd I suppose all of your women are fast asleep after you take care of them.\u201d\u201cDamn straight. I\u2019m like a superhero. The Prolactinator.\u201d\nEmerie Rose came out to New York City to start her career and also to earn the affection of a colleague. And so with very little money, Emerie finds herself discovering that the Big Apple took a big bite into her life savings. Not only was she a victim of a rental scam but nothing seems to be going right for her, that is until she meets Drew Jagger.\nHow do I apply for the job?\u201d\u201cThe job?\u201d She actually seemed confused. I thought I was pretty damn clear. \u201cOf sexual partner. I think we should have sex.\u201dAfter striking some kind of friendship, Drew temporarily lets Emerie use one of his office spaces for her personal office. And soon, these two finds themselves fighting an attraction to one another. Drew is well aware that Emerie is hung up on a man. It takes Emerie awhile to see that her crush and infatuation with this man is nothing compared to her friendship and attraction to Drew. When Drew makes it known to Emerie that he wants her, fireworks are going off. Yes, I am talking about hot, dirty, steamy sex takes place. And for the first time in a long time, Drew begins to open his heart to Emerie. But what happens when Drew\u2019s ex-wife comes back into the picture and stirs up drama? Will everything that Drew has loved be taken away? And will Emerie be able to finally show Drew that he is indeed worth the risk and the fight even though he is an egomaniac?\nI am in utter bliss right now. Yes, I practically inhaled this book in one sitting. This book owned me. Drew Jagger was the epitome of ultimate book boyfriend when it came to his affection for Emerie Rose. Did I also mention that this egomaniac has a heart of gold? So if you are looking for a love story that blends heart, romance, and steam then this book is definitely for you. \nVi Keeland"}, {"userName": "Bibi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33411728-bibi", "userReview": "**Spoilers Galore** Egomaniac read like it had a thousand pages. I kept wondering if it would never end. Granted no one reads romance novels for its plausibility, still, the plot was unconvincing. Here are a few issues that bothered me which in turn made this less entertaining:DREW1. Drew, at 29, has an office and a penthouse flat on park avenue. Park Avenue?! In NYC! Did I miss when the author told us he was a trust fund baby? 2. He has one friend. 1?3. As this hotshot divorce lawyer, it seemed out of place that he had no staff. Yes, we get his assistant was on medical leave but why didn't he have a temp? For the entirety of this book, he had no staff. How does a legal practice function without at the minimum, a paralegal? Are we to believe he typed his court documents, handled clients issues, appeared in court AND still had time to fight his ex-wife, fuck his new office tenant and spend time with his 6yr old son? Look, I know Emerie helped out by answering calls and stuff, still, something rankled. Likewise, Emerie.1. Who moved to NYC because a guy she fancied herself in love with had recently relocated there. To top that, she rents an office space, pays cash, yet has no legal documentation for said transaction. This by a woman who practices as a psychologist? *Laughs, but not a funny laugh*2. She has Zero friends. At 28? Why? Even if she recently relocated from Oklahoma, didn't she have friends back home? Someone to talk to on the phone? PLOTMoving on. The plot. As this is the 3rd book I've read by Ms. Keeland, I notice she's a thematic writer. Much like Alexa Riley with insta-love and Jordan Silver with caveman heroes, Keeland usually has a villainous ex-wife or as was the case in Bossman, a deceased GF. Point being, there's usually a 3rd character whose main purpose is to instigate conflict. How utterly predictable. Much of the above could have been unnoticed- or overlooked- had the MCs had a relationship that progressed beyond sex. I'll confess to being unimpressed by their banter. Further, I searched hi n lo for the chemistry but it remained elusive and I disliked how Keeland blatantly juxtaposed Emerie with Drew's ex. Emerie being the saintly woman who would follow- for love- any man to anywhere and Alexa as the woman who would follow the man purely for cash. Honestly, I thought Alexa the smart one. *shrugs*Finally, I HATED how the declaration of the I Love yous was unveiled through Roman the \"Peacemaker\". *stumps feet* Hated. It! You may wonder if I liked anything about the book. I did. That cover....yum! But, a cover does not a story make. Overall, forgettable and utterly predictable.

ASAP!! Because trust me, you don\u2019t want to miss the awesomeness of Vi Keeland. I\u2019ve read several books by this author and I enjoyed every single one of them, but 'Egomaniac' might be her best book to date. I loved the f@ck out of this book! It was definitely my kind of romcom and I hope Mrs. Keeland never stops writing them.\n\n\u201cI have moves. I swear. I\u2019m just all sorts of off tonight because of everything that happened.\u201d(\u2026)\u201cIf we\u2019re showing off moves, I\u2019d be happy to demonstrate some of mine, too.\u201d\n\nDrew\u2019s office space had been getting a renovation for the last two weeks while he was out of town on vacation. When one night, when he comes back, he finds in his office a redhead beauty who tells him the office space it\u2019s hers, he\u2019s more than astonished and amused. Since he\u2019s the rightful occupant, then the strange woman is an intruder, a gorgeous intruder who seems to have some \u201cinteresting\u201d Krav Maga skills. Apparently, she\u2019s not really an intruder since someone, a scammer, leased her Drew\u2019s office space for a large amount of money.Emerie feels like crap. Not only she feels like an intruder, but she also was scammed out of her life savings. She feels stupid and embarrassed, but also desperate since she doesn\u2019t have an office anymore. Drew takes pity on her, so he makes her an offer she can\u2019t refuse - in exchange for answering his phones while his secretary is away for a while, he will let her stay until she finds a new place.As days pass by, Drew and Emerie realize that they are complete opposites \u2013 in every single way. While one is a pessimist, the other is an optimist, while one is angry and bitter, the other is happy and friendly, while one \u201cdestroys relationships\u201d (divorce lawyer), the other help people save their marriages (marriage counselor). Needless to say, they don\u2019t have anything in common\u2026except the strong attraction that gets harder to deny by the day.\n\n\u201cI think your body likes me, and your head is fighting it. The two should fight it out like adults\u2014naked in the bedroom with me.\u201d\n\nOnce again, Vi Keeland managed to perfectly blend all the romantic elements I love reading about in a romcom. \n'Egomaniac'\n was sweet, sexy, with just a little drama, delightful interactions, witty banter and two main characters I loved from the very beginning. This book held me at the edge of my seat from the beginning until the end. It made me smile, grin and laugh and even swoon a little and I honestly had a blast reading Drew and Emerie\u2019s journey to happiness.I loved Drew and Emerie \u2013 individually and together. They were such endearing, relatable, well portrayed characters. Emerie was kind of na\u00efve, but sweet, thoughtful and patient and such a firecracker at times. I loved her feistiness, but also her positivity. Overall, she was an adorable, relatable character I really enjoyed reading about.\n\n\u201cI might not like to eat at fancy restaurants, but you\u2019ll always be fed, and I\u2019ll eat you until you\u2019re the one screaming obscenities.\u201d\n\nI loved Drew! He might be the best hero this author had ever written so far. So, I have to admit here, he charmed me from the moment he was introduced. I liked the fact that he wasn\u2019t really an a$$hole, his cockiness and I absolutely loved his sarcasm. This man was something else\u2026in a very good way, of course! If at times Drew was angry and bitter, other times he was so, so sweet and thoughtful. Needless to say, he melted my heart, but I have to say that he also left me hot and bothered with his sexy, dirty mouth. I absolutely loved his dirty mouth!As I said, I loved these two together. I loved how they get to know each other, their meals together and most of all their banter and playful interactions. Their back and forth was entertaining as hell and I loved their palpable chemistry. I enjoyed the pace of the story, the dual POV, the engaging story line and the ending which was\u2026OMG, so damn sweet and perfect!If you are looking for a sweet, sexy, lighthearted read, with plenty of funny moments, then you MUST read this one!

This amazingly addictive book was SEXY, FUN and FULL OF FEELS!! Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down. With its cocky, jaded, dirty-talking attorney hero and sassy, fiery heroine who argued, bantered, and slowly fell in love, and a surprisingly emotional twist to the story, it was a perfect romantic reading escape. I LOVED IT! If you're looking for a great new book to escape into, I highly recommend this one!!Now, I could give you my explanation of what the story is about, but to be honest, I love the blurb so much that I'm going to let it speak for itself...\n\nThe night I met Drew Jagger, he'd just broken into my new Park Avenue office.I dialed 9-1-1 before proceeding to attack him with my fancy new Krav Maga skills.He quickly restrained me, then chuckled, finding my attempted assault amusing.Of course, my intruder had to be arrogant.Only, turned out, he wasn't an intruder at all.Drew was the rightful occupant of my new office. He'd been on vacation while his posh space was renovated.Which was how a scammer got away with leasing me office space that wasn't really available for rent.I was swindled out of ten grand.The next day, after hours at the police station, Drew took pity on me and made me an offer I couldn't refuse. In exchange for answering his phones while his secretary was out, he'd let me stay until I found a new place.I probably should have acted grateful and kept my mouth shut when I overheard the advice he was spewing to his clients. But I couldn't help giving him a piece of my mind.I never expected my body to react every time we argued. Especially when that was all we seemed to be able to do.The two of us were complete opposites. Drew was a bitter, angry, gorgeous-as-all-hell, destroyer of relationships. And my job was to help people save their marriages.The only thing the two of us had in common was the space we were sharing.And an attraction that was getting harder to deny by the day.\n\nSo there you had these two opposites working together in the most unlikely of situations -- a marriage counselor and divorce lawyer sharing office space while fighting an intense and growing attraction to each other. Let me tell you, it made for some pretty awesome banter!\nShe pushed one and proceeded to report the crime of entering one\u2019s own office. \u201cI\u2019d like to report a robbery.\u201d\u201cRobbery?\u201d I arched an eyebrow and looked around. A lone folding chair and crappy metal folding chair were the only furniture in the entire space. \u201cWhat exactly am I stealing? Your winning personality?\u201dShe amended her complaint to the police. \u201cA breaking and entering. I\u2019d like to report a breaking and entering at 575 Park Avenue.\u201d She paused and listening. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s armed. But he\u2019s big. Really big. At least six feet. Maybe bigger.\u201dI smirked. \u201cAnd strong. DOn\u2019t forget to tell them I\u2019m strong, too. Want me to flex for you?\u201d\nThis is one of those stories that are just so gosh darn fun to read that you don't even notice the pages flying by...\n\u201cDo you usually order lunch? I\u2019m afraid to go out and miss the delivery.\u201d \u201cSometimes. What are you in the mood for?\u201dI shrugged. \u201cI don\u2019t care. I\u2019m not picky.\u201d\u201cHow about Indian food? Curry House is a few blocks away and delivers quick.\u201dI scrunched up my nose.\u201cYou don\u2019t like Indian food?\u201d\u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cOkay. How about Chinese?\u201d\u201cToo much MSG.\u201d\u201cSushi?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m allergic to fish.\u201d\u201cMexican?\u201d\u201cToo heavy for lunch.\u201d\u2028\u201cYou do understand what the phrase \u2018I\u2019m not picky\u2019 means, right?\u201dI narrowed my eyes at him. \u201cOf course. You\u2019re just picking weird stuff.\u201d\u201cWhat would you like to eat, Emerie?\u201d\u201cPizza?\u201dHe nodded. \u201cPizza it is. See? I\u2019M not picky.\u201d\nIt's told from both his and her POVs, largely in the present, with a few flashbacks that show us a very key part of Drew's past -- and the more you read, the more you understand how much this part of his past shaped him into the man he'd become. And the more you see the real sweetness he'd hiding behind all the cockiness. \n\u201cYou have three seconds to get out of my office. Otherwise you\u2019re giving me permission to do whatever I want with you.\u201d I swallowed. My voice broke as I held his gaze. \u201cI Came in here to yell at you.\u201d\u201cI like it when you\u2019re angry.\u201d He paused. \u201cOne.\u201d\u201cYou like it when I\u2019m angry?\u201d\u201cI find it turns me on. Two.\u201d\u201cYou won\u2019t do anything at three if I tell you to stop.\u201dHe inched even closer. \u201cOf course not. You trust me. But you won\u2019t tell me to stop.\u201d He paused. \u201cLast chance.\u201dI stood frozen as he counted off his last number. \u201cThree.\u201dBefore I could object, his mouth crashed down on mine\u2026\nI don't want to specifically blurt out what the twist it, but I want to give you a hint as to what to look forward to -- trying to show you in what way this book is different than others -- so I'll just say that there's something to do with kids and adoption. AND IT IS SO HEART-MELTING!!!!!!!!! Seriously guys, I was fighting tears in the epilogue because of how incredible beautiful and meaningful it was. Gah, I loved it!!!\n\u201cBeing a parent is a choice, not a right\u2026 Anyone can become a father, but it takes a real dad to love and raise a child as his own.\u201d\nBasically, just READ THIS BOOK!! It's a fantastic light-hearted romance that was HOT HOT HOT but balanced with just enough feels to make me care deeply for these characters and to make my HEART RACE!!! It's fun. It's sexy. There's wicked banter, seriously steamy chemistry, and surprisingly strong feels!

Yet somehow, he had become a necessity for me, and I was in no way ready to take on a drought.\nEGOMANIAC is the story of one sexy as hell New York City divorce attorney and a sweet but utterly na\u00efve psychologist, who specializes in couples counseling, who end up sharing office space through highly unusual circumstances. Drew Jagger is easy on the eyes and has no problem getting women to drop their panties for him. He\u2019s quite the skilled dirty talker too!! He discovers a squatter in his office space when he comes back from a two-week vacation. The first encounter between Drew and Emerie is one of the funniest scenes in the story!!Emerie has just moved to New York City and has managed to be swindled out of her life savings all within a New York minute! While Drew was away, his offices were being renovated and a conman ends up renting one of the offices to Emerie in exchange for a large sum of cash! After things are cleared up between Drew and Emerie, he ends up helping her out of a jam in court. Aside from being a knockout, there\u2019s something about Emerie that has Drew wanting to protect her, so he ends up letting her use one of his offices while she tries to save up and find an affordable office elsewhere. She ends up being quite a resource as she helps him with his schedule and client visits while his secretary is temporarily out on disability. While the two start to become good friends, there\u2019s no denying the strong attraction that is beginning to build between them. There are little roadblocks in the path to happiness for the two. Firstly, is the reason for Emerie\u2019s relocation to New York City. She followed Baldwin, a man she has harbored a deep crush on since college. The guy keeps her dangling by his pinky finger by throwing her little scraps here and there to give her some shred of hope. Then there\u2019s Drew\u2019s ex-wife, whose constant presence in his life and underhanded ways has really messed with his ability to trust and has him wary of diving into another serious relationship.\nIt felt like a slow build to get to the out of this world hotter than \u201dH\u201d schmexy times but, oh my, was it worth the wait!!! Clearly, Drew deserves the title of Egomaniac because he has what it takes to bring a woman to the highest realm of ecstasy. Soon Drew and Emerie are falling hard for each other but when Drew\u2019s ex turns his world upside down, will his misguided actions to make matters less complicated cost him the one true love of his life?EGOMANIAC releases on January 16th!

Jagger, a divorce attorney and Emerie Rose, a psychologist specialized in the field of couples in need of help with their relationships- counseling them on how to fix their relationships. Finding themselves in a situation that is completely awkward, screams destiny putting them together, Drew and Emerie have a spark going on from the very beginning of their existence together. Even though their jobs put them in a situation that is rather ironic to be seen together, Vi Keeland makes the exception with these two by providing a powerful love story. \u27b3It starts off by providing a small background story of why Drew and Emerie are the people they are. Drew having a history with his former wife and the fact that he is a single father, and Emerie trying to defy the feelings she said she had over her college friend. Their friendship begins to evolve when Emerie is in trouble and Drew, the sweetheart he is, helps her out and gets out of trouble. Being conned and forcing a saddening expression of Emerie, Drew has an urge to help and protect her while he can. At first, it was just to watch the beautiful woman walk around his office in Park Avenue. However, it slowly began to change when their pasts, emotions, and physical attractions began to take a turn of events. Bringing their physical desires and physical attractions to life, Vi provides a better and more sculpted understanding on how her writing is exquisite;\u201dNever in my life had I felt so much desire. It was so powerful, I wanted to cause him pain. Which was completely out of character for me, I liked sex sweet and loving. This was pure, unadulterated, carnal need\u2026\"\u27b3While Vi makes it clear to the reader that this story is the definition of destiny finding a path for those who are not looking, and the act of second chances for someone, there is also the lack of a story plot-climax. Something was definitely missing in this story, which is odd for me to admit because I adore Vi Keeland. However, this story has to be the only and my least favorite of all her works. Yes, the fact that Drew has a son and the mystery of who the real father is the action/drama behind the relationship between himself and Emerie, there was something exciting, or more for better words, thrilling, about it. It\u2019s the same cliche act of coordination I found similar from Stuck-Up-Suit by Penelope Ward, which says something coming from the fact that both authors constantly work together in other famous and incredibly writing books/stories. \u27b3Overall, I really enjoyed this story. I was surely expecting more but I was satisfied after the beautiful happy ending. An ending that found a special place in my heart because of the heart-warming butterflies being caused in me. \u27b3Hero rating: 4.0\u27b3Heroine rating: 4.0\u27b3Sexual tension rating: 4.5\u27b3Sex scenes rating: 4.0\u27b3Sex scenes frequency: 4.0\u27b3Plot rating: 3.5\u27b3Dialogue rating: 4.0\u27b3Storytelling rating: 4.0\u27b3Story ending rating: 4.5\u27b3Order Links:iBooksAmazonAmazon Paperback"}, {"userName": "Penelope Ward", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4381852-penelope-ward", "userReview": "My absolute favorite Vi Keeland book ever!"}, {"userName": "\u25c6 Anna's \u01a6\u00aa\u03fb\u0181\u2113\u2139\u057cg$ \u25c6", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22324639-anna-s-g", "userReview": "3.5 STARS READ IT. LIKED IT. NOT MY FAVORITE. Before you grab your pitchforks\u2026That does not mean I didn't enjoy this book. I did, actually. Or that it wasn't good. It was. It's just that there are different levels of 'good'. For me, this book wasn't exceptionally good (4 stars) or mind-blowingly good (5 stars). Just another good romance.It is well-written and the characters are interesting and likable. The story is good too. Sure, there were parts I liked less, but the overall impression was good. I love how the author incorporated the past chapters into the book. Usually I'm not a fan of past and present storylines, but here they didn't bother me. The past chapters were short and to the point without detracting from the unfolding plot. I loved the first half half of the book: it was funny, hot and refreshing. I loved the characters and their banter. Unfortunately, I started to lose interest in the second part. The story seemed to lose its intrigue, charm and spark. And I got bored (but not to the point where I wanted to quit reading). Overall, a good read which didn't quite reach its full potential.

That's what Egomaniac did to me.Drew Jagger is a lawyer who practices on his own. When he returned to his office from his Hawaii vacation, he was shocked to find out that there's a stranger inside and it's a woman with a fiery red hair. When Emerie Rose saw him, she was horrified and she instantly threatened him to go away because she's going to call a cop. She then claimed that it's her office and she's been staying there for a while now. Turns out that she rented the place and paid a large sum of money to a scammer!It's my first time to read a book where both characters have opposing nature of work (Drew as a divorce attorney and Emerie as a marriage counselor) and I loved it because it showed a unique characterization. The romance was wonderfully done. Vi Keeland did an amazing job building a great chemistry between Drew and Emerie. Man, these two are quite a pair! The only thing that I didn't quite like was Drew's attitude. There were multiple places throughout the story where he was a bit conceited. Well, duh. The title shows it eh? I didn't see any character development with him, though, and I wished his \"egomaniac\" ways were somehow lessened as the story goes. Having said that, I loved how balanced this book was. It started out cute and entertaining and in the middle part, it became sweet. Then there were little conflicts from Drew's past that, thank God, didn't ruin the story. Those conflicts made Drew and Emerie become a good team. I enjoyed watching them work their issues out.As this book fell into the workplace romance trope, the way they worked together in one place where it's fueled with sexual tension was a bit crazy, too. In a good way.

I was very excited to read this book because we are talking about Vi Keeland and everybody knows how talented she is. She proved it in her solo books and the ones in collaboration with Penelope Ward. Unfortunately, this book receives only 3 stars. The story follows Emerie, a young psychologist that moves to NY to boost her career. She has all figured out, on office, pretty furniture, stationary for her leased space, and a plan to follow her secret crush wherever he goes. Until one night, somebody enters her office like he owns the place. And actually, he does. Drew Jagger is the owner of the the space she already payed for.. Confused? Well turns out that Emerie was scammed and the thief ran away with her money, renting her a place that was already owned by somebody. Drew, as a lawyer, helps Emerie out in failing a complain for the con, but of course, there are other plans in stored for this young couple. Eventually, Drew will let her share his space until his secretary will return from sick leave. She will be able to hold her meetings there, while helping Drew in the administrative part. You can imagine that this smells like romance. Emerie and Drew are so much alike it hurts. Their relationship is based mainly on disagreeing, fighting and flirting. YES! A lot of flirting. Emerie is now in NY basically because she is in love with an old friend, who got a job here and relocated. She never expressed her feelings to him, always being in the shadows and feeling OK with the leftovers. Until a certain somebody will make his way very deep into her heart and will change her perspective about love. She only feels confident in her work, her field being marriage conciliation. Drew on the other hand, is a lawyer that specializes in divorce.. So, there you have it, opposite, but in the same time, so attracted to each other. As Emerie said, Drew is   \" thriving on misogynistic tendencies he developed because of his lying, cheating ex-wife, and attempts to extricate men from their failed marriages by leaving their women penniless.\"  Because of his past experiences, he is like a machine, never allowing him to fell in love again. He is scared and Emerie presence in his life felt right for the first time in many years.They become good friends and of course the attraction in palpable, mainly from Drew's side. God, he is the definition of egomaniac, cocky, self absorbing, confident and narcissist in one man. But in a way, I liked him this way. I enjoyed so much the funny dialogues, they were amazing and my rating improved because of this. They were so good and I don't remember the last time I laughed this hard. But, my enjoy list ends here.. I didn't feel that connection between the characters, at any level. Maybe Drew with his strange tendencies and past experiences put in shadow their chemistry, but I just didn't feel it. Plus, I wanted him to fight harder for Emerie when the time came.. AND, Emerie didn't convince be to be so in love with Drew also.. I mean, she was sweet and caring with him, but I couldn't identify a moment in which I was truly convinced they were in love.. I always realized when the couple fells in love, but this time, it was all in a blur for me..Whatever, I have a picky moment I believe.So, there you have it. A good and easy read, with a lot of funny and hot moments, with an agreeable but not realistic hero and an uncertain heroine. Now that I come to think of it, the plot reminds me a little of Stuck Up Suit.. a little:)3 stars!For more reviews please check https://readwithloveblog.wordpress.com"}, {"userName": "Sophia Triad", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44642860-sophia-triad", "userReview": "Well, this is one of these times that I have chosen a book based on its cover. I hadn\u2019t read any book by Vi Keeland before, but I have read some of the wonderful reviews about this book and I noticed all the high ratings. So, I said \u201cwhy not?\u201dI wouldn\u2019t mind reading something really funny this Saturday about another arrogant, self center alpha male who is making the life of the girl hell, because deep down he really wants her and wants to have babies with her.Thus, I started the book and there is this first scene where they meet for the first time. This is supposed to be funny I guess. The ignorant girl who has come to New York from Oklahoma who does not know how expensive renting is in NY, who does not know how difficult is to get an office in Park Avenue in such short time, who straight away pays 10000 dollars cash to the scumbag and in just one week orders stationary, desk and business cards with her new address and who never asks the doorman anything about this office. I did not laugh. I did not giggle. I did not smile.After the beginning of their story, things get better \u2013although it took me a while to warm up. I liked the way Drew and Emerie interacted. They had their cute moments, you know coworkers become fuck buddies and then they have feelings and suddenly it is less like \u201cjust-sex\u201d and it is more like a \u201creal-relationship\u201d. You know how it goes. But still the moments were just cute. I did not find them funny. I was just smiling here and there with some of the dialogues.At some point we also learn the tragic past of Drew. How he got played, how he lost almost everything important because of a woman and how he is dealing with it now. That part of the book was heartbreaking and it took over most of the book. I loved it. The moments were full of emotion, I had a few tears and I cheered in the end.But here comes the other thing. Drew is NOT an egomaniac. The title of the book is so wrong. The cover of the book is so wrong. Okay, he is good looking. Okay it is easy to get laid because of his looks. But he is just a sweetheart. Heartbroken and scared. Let\u2019s not forget that he helped Emerie, although he did not have to help her. And not because he wanted to have sex with her. This is a book about relationships and second chances, not about hunting and conquering.\nPeople don\u2019t leave when they love someone. They stick around forever.\nWill I ever read the book again? Absolutely yes, now that I know what to expect.Will I read another book by this author? Absolutely yes, because her writing style is excellent and this book was glued in my hands until I finished it."}, {"userName": "Alba and Her Secrets..\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15917463-alba-and-her-secrets", "userReview": "5 'Gotcha Day' Stars!I had crazy high expectations for this book. CRAZY HIGH. Vi's last release was one of my favorites last year and I rated it with my highest rating. While I have to say Bossman is still my favorite, Egomaniac definitely reached those expectations. It was SO GOOD!So Egomaniac is the story of Drew Jagger and Emerie Rose, a hot office romance you don't want to miss! This standalone novel is about two people (a divorce attorney and a marriage counselor) who, because of let's say curious circumstances, are forced to share the same office. This 'sharing' becomes so much more because this opposite couple is extremely attracted to each other and they start a HOT AF and emotional romance. \n\u201cI have moves. I swear. I\u2019m just all sorts of off tonight because of everything that happened.\u201d \u201cIf we\u2019re showing off moves, I\u2019d be happy to demonstrate some of mine, too.\u201d\nI love Vi's writing. I looooooooooove it. She develops her stories so fluently and in a pace a very much enjoy. She gives us some slow burn, some angst, some drama and definitely some funny and crazy hot moments! Drew is so dirty and together with Em, they are an amazing couple. I love me some playboy with secrets and a sassy heroine (and their banter)! \n\u201cYou\u2019re an egomaniac.\u201d \u201cMaybe. But an attractive one.\u201d\u201cI think your body likes me, and your head is fighting it. The two should fight it out like adults\u2014naked in the bedroom with me.\u201d \nAnd you must be wondering.. playboy with secrets? Yeah! Not everything is hearts and flowers (and mindblowing sex!) between these two. Drew is a divorced man and let's just say his past life is still making appearences in his life. I hated his ex-wife SO MUCH, OMG it made me love Drew even more when he fighted for what he wants (you'll know what I am talking about if you read the book). This mystery I am talking about gave us the most adorable moments! \n\u201cSomeone is going to be coming in any moment.\u201d \u201cOh, someone\u2019s about to come in alright.\u201d He slipped his hand under the back of the shirt and palmed my ass. \u201cI\u2019m going to fuck you up against this window.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re a beautiful man, Drew Jagger. And I don\u2019t mean on the outside.\u201d\nAnd going back to Drew and Emerie's relationship, as always, when feelings got involved in the mix, Egomaniac got even better for me! These two were incapable of not falling in love with each other, I mean with that chemistry, it was impossible not to! And the ending, it was absolutely sublime, I loved every single word!\n\u201cYou\u2019re the red in my black and white world.\u201d\nTherefore, my rating for Egomaniac is 5 STARS! It was a great way to start the year with Vi Keeland, one of my favorite writers. A wonderful love story full of sexy times, all the feels and a couple with overwhelming chemistry! I can't wait to see what is next and I definitely can't wait for Keeland's new upcoming release with Penelope Ward.

EGO MANIAC:  \nThis review is going to be as spoiler free as I possibly can do it. A few quotes here and there, and a brief overview of what's to come when you one click this, but there's so much more to this book than what my review divulges. \nWe're first introduced to Drew Jagger (not related to Mick Jagger) who had just arrived back in Manhattan on News Year's Eve after being on a 2 week holiday in Hawaii in the hopes that his office space would\u2019ve had a complete do over whilst he was away. What he didn\u2019t expect to encounter was an intruder. A gorgeous pint sized intruder with laughable Krav Maga skills that she unleashed on him.\n For a crazy person - now that I was looking - she was pretty damn cute.Fiery red hair piled on top of her head seemed to match her firecracker personality. Seeing a light on in the file room he goes to investigate not thinking he would encounter a female standing on a chair screaming at him threatening to call the police on him.\n  \"You don\u2019t need to call the police. This is my office.\u201d\u201cDo I look stupid to you? You just broke into my office.\u2019\u201cYour office? I think you took a wrong turn at the corner of Crazy and Nutjob.\"Getting down to the mix up it transpires that newly arrival in town Emery Rose had been conned out of ten thousand dollars by a scammer posing as a leasing agent. She\u2019d believed everything the man had told her. Of course, he had to be gorgeous. Because I couldn\u2019t mortify myself in front of an ugly man. \n  \"Tell the truth.If I was short, bald, broke, and toothless with a hump on my back, you\u2019d have told me off after catching me looking at your ass? \"\"You\u2019re an egomaniac.\" \nDrew was a bitter, angry, gorgeous-as-all-hell, destroyer of relationships. And Emery's job was to help people save their marriages. Polar opposites in every sense of the word, but sharing an office space it was only a matter of time when their differences just didn't matter. You're the red in my black and white world. \n EGO MANIAC:  Was everything I could\u2019ve wished for and more, the feels zapped me in chapter one, the giggles hit me in chapter two and they just kept coming and coming.

So if you're after a laugh out loud, feels good book then this is one you won\u2019t want to miss!! This is probably my favorite book to date by this author, I read this in record time, once I started I couldn't put it down. Was so so good!!

It\u2019s really no surprise to me considering Vi Keeland is one of my all-time favourite authors. She has the innate ability to draw me in to her amazing stories from the very first page. Her books are always fun, sexy and somewhat emotional. From the moment I started reading this book I couldn\u2019t put it down. I love all of her books, but I have to say that I believe \u201cEgomaniac\u201d is her best to date. It seems her books just get better and better.This amazing story unfolds with Drew Jagger arriving back to Manhattan after holidaying in Hawaii, only to discover a squatter setting up camp in his office suite. The squatter happens to be Emerie Rose and that is where all the fun begins. Their first encounter was absolutely hilarious, especially when Emerie tries to take out Drew with her Krav Maga skills. This scene was really funny as there is a comedy of errors during their first meeting.\n\u201cI do take Krav Maga, you know.\u201d\u201cGood for you. You scarred me a little when I walked in. I bet you can kick some little-girl butt.\u201d\n It comes to light that Emerie leased the office space, but was scammed by her \u2018supposed\u2019 agent. He leased her office space that was not up for lease and took off with all of her life savings. Panic starts to set for Emerie as she has already ordered her business cards and letterhead for her patients at this address and is due to have all of her office furniture delivered. Emerie feels like an intruder, an absolute idiot and somewhat embarrassed by the whole situation. Drew doesn\u2019t help matters when he points out to her how na\u00efve she is, thinking she can rent office space in Park Avenue for what she paid her agent. Drew however takes pity on Emerie and offers her a solution to her problems; she can continue to work in his office on the proviso that she helps him out with some secretarial duties while his secretary is recovering from surgery. In dire straits she immediately takes him up on this amazing offer.What can I possibly say about these two main characters except that they were amazing and I loved absolutely everything about them, from their hilarious witty banter to their ability to trust and confide in one another. They are complete opposites in every sense of the word. Drew is arrogant and a complete egomaniac. Through no fault of his own he doesn\u2019t believe in matrimonial bliss and as a result his chosen profession is a divorce attorney. Emerie on the other hand is a sweet, but somewhat na\u00efve girl originally from Oklahoma. She believes that loves can in fact conquer all; that distance and time should never diminish true love and this is why her chosen career is as a marriage counsellor. \n\u201cMaybe, just maybe, neither one of us had found the right one before now\u2026because we hadn\u2019t met each other yet.\u201d\n \u201cEgomaniac\u201d is such a light-hearted and fun read with just the right amount of emotion and feeling that Vi does so well. I became completely invested in this story and these characters that I just couldn\u2019t get enough. I highly recommend this story to anyone who loves great characters as you simply can\u2019t help but fall in love with them and the well written hot and steamy scenes. If you haven\u2019t read this book yet, do yourself a favour and bump it up your TBR list.

This book seriously has everything. It's hilarious, sexy, with the kind of twist that I just die for and it kept me on the edge of my seat. Plus the sassy heroine and jerky but not really jerky hero were perfect!Emery had just moved to NYC and was setting up her new office space when a sexy intruder made her realize that she'd been conned. Instead of getting a really good deal on the perfect place to meet with her marriage counseling clients, she's actually inhabiting divorce lawyer Drew Jagger's newly remodeled office space. While Drew might be the anti to everything Emery believes in, she finally catches a break when Drew takes a shine to her. Drew helps her through her debacle and allows her to share his office until she can find something else. These two polar opposites: Drew, bitter and angry, and Emery, hopeful and sweet, build a relationship neither expects. And through their friendship, the sexual tension between them builds and sparks fly.I seriously loved everything about this book. From the first word to the last, I was captivated. I laughed out loud. I swooned. I felt all the feels. And I was held hostage by the build up of both their stories. Told in alternating points of view as well as a few before and after bits, Vi Keeland wrote a story that I couldn't get enough of.

So when comes back from vacation and he discovers someone has broken into his newly renovated office he\u2019s not at all pleased. That is until the burglar turns out to be a skirt dropping, drop dead gorgeous redhead with a sassy mouth and fiery spirit to match. She drives him crazy with her unwanted and idealistic opinions on relationships every time they argue, which is constantly. But as they start to share meals, office space and a bit of each other\u2019s lives, they fall in an easy, albeit somewhat warring, relationship with an explosive attraction. But when Drew\u2019s past threatens their budding relationship, will he fight for it or let her go to protect himself?\n\nHave you ever jumped right into a book not entirely knowing what to expect other than being certain you\u2019ll enjoy it because you\u2019ve read the author before? It\u2019s a pretty great feeling when all your expectations are met. Egomaniac made me laugh, smile, swoon and even giggle from the start to finish with its charming characters and sweet plot even though I had some initial doubts.When I first met Emery I thought I wouldn\u2019t be able to relate much with her. She seemed too na\u00efve for the angry and jaded divorce lawyer. But my doubts were soon put to rest because the redhead firecracker was more than up for the challenge to deal with the sexy alpha male with a dirty mouth. \n\nWith a title such as this one I was expecting not just an Egomaniac hero, I was expecting a @ssh*le.

I couldn\u2019t get enough of them and when I got to the end I remembered Jane Austen and her quote \u201cIf a book is well written I always find it too short.\u201d \n\nEgomaniac is a standalone contemporary romance by author Vi Keeland told from both points of view.

He lives and works in a building on Park Avenue that's considered prime real estate in NYC. He returns home from a vacation to find a beautiful feisty woman in his office. While he was out of town his office space was to be renovated. He comes back to this woman accusing him of being an intruder.Emerie Rose freaks out when she thinks a man is breaking into her new office she just rented about a week ago. She proceeds to attack her intruder only to learn he actually is the true owner of her office. Turns out she was scammed out of her life savings & rented an office that wasn't available. \nSuddenly she has little funds & nowhere to go. Drew offers to let Emerie help him out while his secretary is on leave in exchange for rent. They are like night & day and complete opposites. As a psychologist, Emerie was in the business of repairing relationships, while Drew helped to destroy them as a divorce attorney. They clash daily & seem to do nothing but argue which continues to fuel their intense sexual tension. They are extremely attracted to one another, & eventually sharing space together creates a connection. They begin spending more time together & it's easy and fun between them. Drew shamelessly flirts with Emerie & makes advances. She can't help the way her body reacts to him, and eventually they act on their mutual desire & indulge in one another physically.\n-He really is beautiful. I wasn't sure I'd ever thought of a man as beautiful before. Handsome, yes. Hot, even. But beautiful fit the bill to describe Drew Jagger-no other word did him justice.-Never in my life had I felt so much desire. -Drew Jagger had stirred a lot of things inside of me that I hadn't felt in a long time.\nDrew was burned bad by a woman in his past & as a result he's cynical about love & commitment. He only enjoys sexual relationships with women and doesn't get attached or do feelings, so when he starts having real feelings for Emerie it scares him to death. He has trouble with trust, but finds himself wanting more with Emerie. Emerie knows Drew's reputation, and doesn't want to get too attached & then get hurt, but when she grows closer to him & gets to know him better she can't help herself. He has such a beautiful heart and she fall's hard for him. I really enjoyed this book & love Vi's writing! She knows how to create the perfect, arrogant, sexy, breathtakingly gorgeous, irresistible man that I can't help fall for every time!"}, {"userName": "Dilek VT", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49572641-dilek-vt", "userReview": "[(Emerie: marriage counselor / Drew: divorce attorney; Emerie: foster child / Drew: stepdad)  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Hulya Kara Yuksel", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32793174-hulya-kara-yuksel", "userReview": "Well I liked it but it\u2019s not my favorite Vi Keeland book (Bossman was soooo good!).

It literally has all of my favorites all rolled into one book!Drew Jagger, like the title suggests, is an egomaniac, but still so freaking lovable. I loved his arrogance, because it wasn\u2019t over the top and added some much humor to the story. A relationship hater, divorce attorney, and overall relationship pessimist turned out to be this amazing guy I couldn\u2019t help but love. Emerie Rose is a psychologist who specializes in marriage counseling and is the perfect opposite for Drew Jagger the divorce attorney. She is the sweet to his salty. She believes in inspirational quotes, communication and love conquering all. She is this positive light that was perfectly sunny without being annoying.Drew and Emerie have the best first encounter when he returns to his office to find her there. She believes she has legally rented the space, but was actually conned and paid all her savings to rent Drew's office. Drew is completely taken with Emerie, she is nothing like any other woman he has ever met and agrees to help her out. The more these two interact the further entangled they get into each others lives. This story is not one of insta-love though. I felt Drew and Emerie connection grow over time and loved how they developed this flirty friendship at first. The flashback chapters gave us a peek into Drew\u2019s past and really helped me understand where he is coming from. I felt the story flowed perfectly and allowed me to see the genuineness in their feelings. I\u2019ll be honest, I knew I would enjoy Egomaniac, Keeland always delivers a fun, sexy story. However, this one is probably one of my favorites. I just loved Drew and Emerie. Egomaniac was just so fresh, flirty, funny and filled with so much heart. I read this in one sitting and could have kept going, because I fell in love with their little world. It was all perfection!
