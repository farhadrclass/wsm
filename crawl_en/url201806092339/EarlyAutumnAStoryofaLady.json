It took me a while to get into. It was written in the late 1920s, which was a slightly more verbose time in literature, and it lacked the sharp and powerful imagery of Fitzgerald. But I was soon sucked in. It\u2019s funny\u2026the whole thing seemed very British/New England-ish. When I was halfway through the novel, I realized that there had only been two events that seemed to have any effect on the plot at all. But as I continued reading, more and more happened, and furthermore, \u201cnothing happening\u201d is central to the theme of the novel. The book is about what happens when traditions become more important than people, when a family name (Pentland) means more than life itself. It\u2019s also about what people are like when they don\u2019t have to work for anything\u2026when everything is given to them. I think the book has its flaws, although I still think it was fantastic. The flaw(s) are discussed below in the spoiler bit. The dialogue was absolutely sparkling. I kept thinking that someone ought to make a movie of this book, if someone hasn\u2019t already. It would lend itself brilliantly to film. The author, who for the most part, tells the story somewhat clinically from the 3rd person, also has moments of shiny wit: \u201c The third Pentland had been the greatest evangelist of his time, a man who went through New England holding high the torch, exhorting rude village audiences by the coarsest of language to such a pitch of excitement that old women died of apoplexy and young women gave birth to premature children.\u201d This would also be a great vehicle for discussing symbolism. At times I felt it was a bit heavy-handed, but I think that\u2019s only because I was looking for it. There\u2019s a dash of Dickens-esque naming too\u2014the family name \u201cPentland\u201d seems to literally mean \u201ca land of imprisonment\u201d\u2026a place where one is permanently \u201cpent up.\u201d I\u2019d recommend this book if you were looking for something literary enough to give your English major heart a turn and simple enough to not be too challenging. (Also, my writing style tends to mirror that of whatever I\u2019ve been reading. Remember when I said that literature in the 1920s was verbose? Look how long this review is\u2026)***SPOILER ALERT***I feel slightly as if Nora had stayed with Torvald after all (\u201cA Doll\u2019s House\u201d). Part of me is satisfied that Olivia has found peace in the end, but it\u2019s a peace which I\u2019m not sure is genuine. It almost has the same feeling as the peace one might have from \u201cfinally loving Big Brother.\u201d I\u2019m still processing it, but it wasn\u2019t quite the cathartic ending I was aching for. I feel a little ill at ease, having just put the book down. Like the orchestra was building to one final crescendo-ing note, and then just went silent. I\u2019m not sure if that\u2019s what the author is intending. I\u2019ll keep processing."}, {"userName": "Anna Gabur", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10712237-anna-gabur", "userReview": "Normally I am not a fan of early 20th century novels because they are very melodramatic, full of pathos and not very relatable.

Fasti ormai trascorsi, complice la malattia dell'unico erede maschio rimasto alla dinastia.Tre sono gli eventi che sconvolgeranno la monotona vita di Olivia: il ritorno di Sabine, cugina di famiglia dei Pentland, donna libera, affascinante e anticonformista; l'innamoramento nei confronti dell'irlandese O'Hara; il ritrovamento di alcune vecchie lettere che portano alla luce un grosso scandalo sepolto nel passato della famiglia, che ribalta letteralmente le prospettive.Olivia, pur non essendo una Pentland di sangue, \u00e8 la spina dorsale della famiglia: donna pacata ma decisa, \u00e8 attorno a lei che la narrazione ruota. Scoprir\u00e0 pian piano che \"essere una Pentland\" non \u00e8 affatto una questione genetica: \u00e8, bens\u00ec, un modo di vivere. Vero protagonista della vicenda \u00e8 infatti il concetto di \"famiglia\", di borghese omert\u00e0 e di protezione, un mondo chiuso dove non esistono sgarri n\u00e9 felicit\u00e0. Come Sabine e Horace, che per il loro spirito inquieto vengono allontanati. Come Olivia, che cerca di trovare la felicit\u00e0 attraverso la figlia Sybil. Come il vecchio John, che sotto sotto approva gli outsider, i \"diversi\", le persone che riescono a sentire la vita come Higgins lo stalliere, ma che crede fermamente nel ruolo delle convenzioni e della tradizione, trascinando tutti nel baratro con lui.Tutto questo corredato da un finale per nulla ovvio.Ci\u00f2 che di questo libro sorprende, al di l\u00e0 della \"classica\" saga familiare, \u00e8 la profondit\u00e0 psicologica dei personaggi: Olivia in primis, tratteggiata con tale delicatezza che non si pu\u00f2 non amarla, ma anche tutti gli altri comprimari. Ognuno con la sua indole e le proprie debolezze, ognuno con le sue sfaccettature di pena e umanit\u00e0. I personaggi presentati come negativi rivelano cos\u00ec inaspettate sfumature di luce - si riesce, quantomeno, a empatizzare con loro - e i personaggi positivi hanno i loro lati oscuri. Fortissimo il binomio fra il ruolo della \"famiglia\" come legaccio e insieme di doveri, contro la libert\u00e0 di scelta e i desideri dell'individuo. Nella dimora dei Pentland non si \u00e8 pi\u00f9 identit\u00e0 singole, ma si agisce sulla base del bene comune della comunit\u00e0. Ed \u00e8 per questo che regna, non vista, la sofferenza. Per tutti, tranne che per pochi individui abbastanza indipendenti da smarcarsi. Questa sofferenza trova le vie di fuga pi\u00f9 estreme, dall'ubriachezza del capofamiglia alla pazzia della vecchia matriarca, fino al continuo risentimento della vecchia zia Cassie, che vorrebbe sottomettere e dominare tutto quanto \u00e8 intorno a lei. Spiccano, su tutti, le donne: sono loro il vero motore della narrazione, e sono loro che tenteranno di opporsi al veleno che la famiglia Pentland rappresenta. Ognuna a modo suo, con risultati differenti e nient'affatto scontati, perch\u00e9 il peso dell'appartenenza alla famiglia Pentland \u00e8 come un'acqua cheta che, a lungo andare, finisce col corrodere.Romanzo come ho detto di notevole finezza psicologica: parte lento, ma appena si ingrana con la lettura fila via come l'acqua.

Ma non posso fare altrimenti: ho letto Autunno con molta difficolt\u00e0, perch\u00e9 ad una lettura quasi edificante e suggestiva si sono alternati fasi nelle quali non mi era psicologicamente possibile leggere pi\u00f9 di una pagina al giorno. Ci sono voluti ben due mesi \u2013 giustificati anche dal periodo critico degli ultimi esami e della stesura della tesi \u2013 per terminarlo ed ora eccomi qui a mettere nero su bianco le mie impressioni.La storia racconta la decadenza dell\u2019aristocrazia americana agli inizi del XX secolo, in particolare della ricca famiglia Pendleton, che cerca in tutti i modi di attenersi ai canoni vittoriani di cui era impegnata la societ\u00e0 americana a quel tempo \u2013 come ci ha insegnato la Wharton ne L\u2019et\u00e0 dell\u2019innocenza, gli americani criticavano le restrizioni inglesi per poi dimostrarsi ben pi\u00f9 puritani e proibizionisti. Dopo la prima guerra mondiale, la famiglia ostenta un\u2019antica ricchezza che non fa altro che mostrare al mondo il loro declino, mentre Anson, ultimo erede della famiglia rimane chiuso nel suo studio a cercare di risollevare la vecchia gloria del suo casato attraverso la stesura di una biografia di famiglia. A tentare di agire per il bene della figlia Sybil e del figlio Jack invece c\u2019\u00e8 Olivia, donna caparbia e intelligente, che tenta di insegnare alla figlia il valore di un matrimonio d\u2019amore piuttosto che un contratto d\u2019infelicit\u00e0 eterna stipulato attraverso nozze combinate. La stasi e l\u2019impossibilit\u00e0 del cambiamento dominano la vita di Olivia, fin quando non compare sulla scena l\u2019irlandese O\u2019Hara, che le sconvolger\u00e0 la vita a tal punto da dover rivedere le proprie priorit\u00e0 e ricominciare a sperare nella possibilit\u00e0 dell\u2019amore e della felicit\u00e0.Il romanzo \u00e8 pieno di clich\u00e9, a partire dal modo in cui \u00e8 ritratta la societ\u00e0, tipico della narrativa borghese degli anni Trenta, e dalla presenza del leitmotiv della donna costretta ad un matrimonio d\u2019interesse che, ad un certo punto della sua vita, decide di perdersi tra le braccia di un amante. Olivia non \u00e8 molto lontana da Emma Bovary, sebbene ami davvero la sua famiglia. L\u2019autore traccia un vero e proprio profilo dei tanti tipi femminili: ad esempio ci sono la zia Cassie, considerata alla stregua di una donna pazza, e Sabine, che dapprima d\u00e0 l\u2019impressione di essere vagamente stupida, ma alla fine si rivela una figura altamente rivoluzionaria. La questione forse pi\u00f9 importante e innovativa portata avanti nel romanzo \u00e8 quella della possibilit\u00e0 del divorzio in una societ\u00e0 cos\u00ec definita e perbenista quale quella americana. Per questo va il mio plauso all\u2019autore, che ha saputo inserire bene nel testo un tema scottante, sebbene alla fine ci\u00f2 che fanno i protagonisti risulti altamente scontato. L\u2019intento di Bromfield era sicuramente analizzare a fondo una societ\u00e0 fatta solo di \u201cfacciata\u201d, dove l\u2019unica cosa che conta \u00e8 tenere a galla la propria rispettabilit\u00e0 per non compromettere le sorti di un\u2019intera famiglia, in un meschino gioco nel quale non conta nulla se non il dio denaro. In maniera disillusa, l\u2019autore racconta dei suoi contemporanei con un taglio elegante e seducente a tratti, ma per alcuni versi scontato e pesante. Devo ammettere di essere rimasta delusa dal finale, nel quale si ha una brusca interruzione del tenore tenutosi in tutto il romanzo, mentre i personaggi perdono di spessore e sembrano pi\u00f9 intenti a blaterare piuttosto che darsi da fare agendo. Chiariamoci, non sono un tipo che disprezza la parola, ma il risultato \u00e8 che alcuni di loro che all\u2019inizio ci avevano dato l\u2019impressione di essere altamente complessi, risultano assolutamente degli inetti. Ho letto questo romanzo in contemporanea con Il Grande Gatsby, romanzo dello stesso periodo e che per certi versi sembra aver avuto un certo influsso su Bromfield, e devo dire che ho apprezzato sicuramente il primo pi\u00f9 del secondo. Autunno rimane, ad ogni modo, un romanzo interessante perch\u00e9 \u00e8 scritto da un uomo ma racconta senza nessun pregiudizio una storia femminile, cosa davvero ammirevole per un romanziere degli anni Venti."}, {"userName": "Joyce Lagow", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2220862-joyce-lagow", "userReview": "Pulitzer Prize winner for 1927.[return][return]Durham, Massachusetts, is an outpost for the old, wealthy families of Boston, such as the Pentlands, who live in a mansion of the same name. The story recounts the lives of the Pentlands in post World War I Durham during late summer and early fall, mostly from the point of view of Olivia, the 40 year old wife of Anson Pentland.There are unwelcome changes to the neighborhood and to the lives of the Pentlands, coming in the form of Sabine Callender, sister of Anson, who is the  black sheep of the family, returning to Pentlands after a scandalous 20 year absence and in Michael O Hara, a self-made Irishman who has risen to wealth and political prominence--but who is definitely not socially acceptable. Tragedies interrupt the placid existence at Pentlands, as the different generations of Pentlands react to these events in their own ways.[return][return]The book has no real plot as such but rather it is an examination of the lives of the very rich who claim distinction through family during the early 20th century. The result is an indictment of meaningless lives, where people of all but the latest generation exist rather than live. Contrasted with these desiccated survivors of an old New England family is the vitality of O Hare, an upstart, a  shanty Irish , who does not have the purity of blood to sully the Pentland name.[return][return]Women are the main protagonists: besides Olivia, there is Aunt Cassie, who is the arbiter of the family morals and  standards; Sabine, who hates everything her family stands for and longs to destroy them; and Sybil, Olivia s daughter, who symbolizes the hope of escape from the stultifying existence of Pentland expectations. These and other characters, however, with the exception of Olivia, are caricatures, one-dimensional, in Bromfield s remorseless attack on upper-class lives. Everyone is a stereotype, although a well-drawn stereotype.[return][return]Bromfield s use of language is stunning. His prose drifts, ephemeral, insubstantial--just like the lives of the Pentlands. Olivia speaks repeatedly of living in an  enchantment that numbs her life. The landscape around Durham is without color, as are the Pentlands.[return][return]While brilliantly written, in the end I found the book unsatisfying. It was just too much of meaninglessness, endlessly repeated, with the characters insufficiently complex to sustain my interest. In the end, they all behave predictably, from Old John Pentland, the patriarch, down to Sybil. This may have been Bromfield s intent, to draw characters so devoid of life in order to rip away any pretense of glamor surrounding the Old Rich, and it may have been novel during the Roaring Twenties, but in today s cynical world, the book doesn t hold up.

Also being introduced is their neighbor and friend, Therese Callendar.It is evident that Olivia is the strength of the family. She hasn't turned age forty and doesn't seem to have time for herself. Her husband spends his time working on charities or on the family genealogy. He lives on an income from his elderly father-who doesn't trust him to run the family business.At a time without television, one means of entertainment for society women was to spend their time going to the houses of their friends, to be entertained and to learn the latest gossip. This is the case for Aunt Cassie (the family busy body) and Sabine Callendar. The women don't like each other and the author describes them as \"...two cats watching each other for days at a time, stealthily.\"Bromfield's wit is in evidence when we read of Aunt Cassie discussing joining her late husband in heaven. Sabine gives us her own thought that, based on the husband's life with his wife, the reunion might not be all that pleasant.Olivia seems forced to live in a world filled with traditions but little love. She does see her daughter trying to escape from this family web and it seems to give her a small glimmer of hope.She meets a man who brings the thrill of love and a new meaning to life.

Sabine has lived the life that Olivia has not. She has loved madly and lived wildly and she is not afraid of upsetting the order of things. She brings trouble and mischief with her, plotting a romance between Olivia's daughter and a French/American bastard boy, and introducing Olivia to a nouveau riche Irish politician who has been in love with Olivia since first sight. Suddenly Olivia's ordered life is thrown into chaos, and for the first time she seriously considers if it is more important to follow the strict constraints of being a Pentland or to live life to the fullest.I must say that one of my weaknesses is books about depressed women in crisis. I think reading about these women and the choices they make helps me think about my own life and choices. This book in particular was beautifully written, with captivating characters and entrancing imagery. It took a little while for the story to really take off, but once it did I found Olivia's struggle compelling, especially since the minor characters around her were also well developed. The Pulitzer Prize committee (I assume it's a committee?) has made a good choice once again."}, {"userName": "ShaLisa", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128348-shalisa", "userReview": "The dominant reason I wanted to read this book was because my dad said he would like to be able write like this author. And the writing was indeed grand and worth reading the book! I appreciated the story. The story made the reader believe it would be desirable and perhaps even noble for Olivia to abandon the line of pride and mirage she lived in and live for herself but I appreciated the path she chose and thought her choice to not abandon the promise she made to her beloved father-in-law and the commitment she made to her husband although her marriage was less than ideal proved her a strong woman which was what the people in her life continually gave her credit for. Ironically, many of her friends believed she should leave with O'Hara but doing that would also dispel all that they believed was good in her.I found the family pride mirage to be outrageous when obvious and so true to life in its subtlety. The family history almost forced the living to live a lie. It became a trap. Olivia, again, showed valiant character with her honesty to herself and others without revealing harmful secrets. She bore the truth. Although the prestige of a family doesn't follow the same suit in most homes now, pride is rampant although changed. This book brought to the surface the notion that one cannot be happy living in a lie of prestige or wealth. To believe the lie is more dangerous."}, {"userName": "Scott Cox", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21638774-scott-cox", "userReview": "Author Louis Bromfield has been described by one biographer as being an \u201cunashamed romantic idealist.\u201d This is perhaps an adroit description of Bromfields\u2019s 1927 Pulitzer Prize winning novel, \u201cEarly Autumn.\u201d Set in post-Puritan New England, it is a clash of two cultures. The first consists of rigid, conservative, and wealthy family members \u2013 whose minister is significantly characterized as being the \u201cApostle to the Genteel.\u201d Maintaining wealth and status has replaced the religious fervor of their industrious forefathers. The other group consists of the more worldly, free-spirited family members who have escaped (or who are attempting to escape) the stifling constraints of this cold, forbidding climate. Many of these latter characters found their guiding light in modern Parisian culture. The novel can be characterized as a morality tale pitting moral responsibility with romantic philosophy, perhaps not unlike that found in Goethe\u2019s \u201cThe Sorrows of Young Werther\u201d or Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cAnna Karenina.\u201d It was an interesting tale, though I found the characters to be a bit too predictable, even shallow, to be all-together believable.

Oh, there are a couple of them, but they try not to openly flaunt it. The others realize they gave up their shot at happiness when they were young, and married the wrong people for the wrong reasons. So they were stuck. Stuck because they believed and lived as if family and appearances count for a lot more than happiness.The prose is interesting enough to tell the story without getting in the way of telling the story. I've read books where good prose made up for a less than great story, but not here. It's not necessarily a *great* story, but good enough. In the beginning, I was curious why the Pulitzer Committee thought it worthy of its prize. Do not be fooled - all those pages of laying a foundation makes the latter third very good reading. Even so, the ending is a bit predictable. It's not the ending you want, but you sort of know its coming. The characterizations are good enough. If you're making your way through the Pulitzers, you'll be glad to have this one on the list. For me, just a good, solid 4 stars, but I'm glad not to have missed it."}, {"userName": "Joy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/644356-joy", "userReview": "I really liked this book. It's a story about a New England family who has become more wealthy through the centuries, but \"dessicated\" as people, so that they keep carrying on, but life moves more like a protected dream than real life. It's a bit of a cliche--the wealthy people in the big house have no life except for an occasional ball, bridge and visiting one another while the servants and middle class folks who are more earthy are very connected to life and passion, including sexual desire. Yet Bromfield's characterization was wonderful and I enjoyed them. I found it interesting that the blurb on the back of the book indicated that Sabine Callendar was the main character but it turned out that she wasn't. Olivia was the main character and all the other characters revolved around her. Olivia has an important choice to make in the book and this is the main plot of the story and, even though it is predictable what she will choose, she's still very interesting and has a fair amount of depth."}, {"userName": "Tamara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1083828-tamara", "userReview": "I would like to give this book 4.5 stars because I liked it better than just really liking it. The atmosphere that Bromfield establishes is almost tangible and all the characters are interesting and intense, even the \"dead, who only live through watching others.\" This book felt a little like Jane Eyre, Rebecca, and Wuthering Heights with the mysteries and secrets and passion and wildness, only I think it was better written than any of the others I listed. Not especially a happy ending, but inevitable and satisfactory, depending on your sense of romance and reality. I am going to have to get my own copy eventually because there are several passages I would like to mark and make notes, especially during a second reading when one already knows the outcome of the various intrigues and manipulations that go on throughout the book.

However, Bromfield refreshes the common story of a family caught between tradition and progress by utilizing a kind of rambling, stream of consciousness narrative structure and turning the focus to the women of the household. The novel has a slow start and dips a bit too far into melodrama at the end, but is absolutely enthralling in the pages in between.

As the book progressed though, I admired the character strength and development of Olivia, and to some degree John Pentland. The plot also grew more complex as Olivia's struggle became more and more tangled between desire and responsibility; the tension was almost palpable.
