The reader must take into account that this is a religious play. As such, certain assumptions are required. An atheist or agnostic will laugh at the \u201cpretensions\u201d but the open-minded should appreciate this play for its character development. The ending is disappointingly contrived but suits Corneille\u2019s purpose: to elicit pride in Christian martyrdom."}, {"userName": "Marti Martinson", "userReviewDate": "Dec 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20387978-marti-martinson", "userReview": "Corneille is no Shakespeare. By that I mean there are no characters with one word entrances and exits, no comic relief, no extensive cast, and no grand scene changes. A character of Chorus, however, might have been helpful, as I did have to research the background of this play; it is fairly amazing to think the general public of 17th century France might have immediately \"gotten\" this play. This English translation, as I do not parle, had couplets, an abab rhyme scheme, syllabic short lines, syllabic LONG lines, rhymes across characters' lines, and even ONE unrhymed soliloquy. I am sure it had to be tweaked from the original, but all I can do is trust the translator Thomas Constable. I did enjoy this and I want to read more Corneille. Despite the fact I could probably be called (or cursed, depending on your personal beliefs) a Post-Modern Christian who likes Spong and Ehrman AND Jesus, the dated faith of the piece was not a turn-off. I read the 50 page Gutengerg free edition:http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2543The play does take place in Armenia. Hey, the FIRST nation to declare Christianity the state religion: Armenia.....just a factoid.Need a break from bawdy Moliere? Try serious Corneille."}, {"userName": "Faran", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2052649-faran", "userReview": "Fantastic play originally, but the English translation by Thomas Constable is, in my opinion, an atrocity.

Along with Moliere and Racine he is considered to be the founder of French tragedy. He is best known for El Cid which was a 1636 tragic/comedy. Written in 1641 Polyeucte was based on the life of the martyr Saint Polyeuctus. Polyeucte is a tragic drama in which Polyeucte, son-in-law to the pagan governor of Armenia, converts to Christianity, an act for which he is condemned to death. His wife, Pauline, who has never loved him, now finds her admiration for him turning into true love.", "title": "Polyeucte", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1490175.Polyeucte", "average": 3.51, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1347746377l/1490175.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3015432.Pierre_Corneille", "name": "Pierre Corneille"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1415453.Pierre_Moreau", "name": "Pierre Moreau"}], "type": ["Plays", "Plays", "Cultural", "Drama", "European Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1490175.Polyeucte", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1228439.Le_Cid", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/857256.L_Illusion_Comique", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/838127.Horace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1424198.Cinna", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213011.The_Cid_Cinna_The_Theatrical_Illusion"]}
