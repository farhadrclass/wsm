The book is set in WW|| occupied Europe. C.H.E.R.U.B (Charles Henderson's Espionage Research Unit B) is a group of covert spies who are all children trained, gathered and run by Charles Henderson. The characters are Troy, an orphan who while trying to protect his brother was abused by his orphanage and rescued by C.H.E.R.U.B. Then there is Marc, a kid who rescued the founder of C.H.E.R.U.B after running away from his orphanage and helping become the first C.H.E.R.U.B spy. Rosie and Paul, brother and sister who escaped from the invasion of France to be recruited by C.H.E.R.U.B. Those are all the characters. In The Secret Army, C.H.E.R.U.B gets trained to parachute and goes on their first training exercise."}, {"userName": "Romana", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/69915585-romana", "userReview": "4 stars (just) - this is much more like what I expected from this series so it\u2019s the best one so far for me.My main criticism from the last book - the unlikely language from young teens - still stands, but the sexism didn\u2019t seem as prominent, mostly because they actually DID something in this book. However I was still confused by Henderson\u2019s domestic issues which were included without much purpose. Ok, Henderson had problems with his wife but it had absolutely no consequences elsewhere and the issues were only skimmed over. I just didn\u2019t see the point.Other than that, I was pretty impressed by the plot. It resembled the Cherub books more in that it focused on Marc, Rosie, Paul, PT and their new friends during training. Granted, they didn\u2019t have a proper mission until very late in the story, but the build up was good and I liked the insight into training.So I\u2019m moving on to the next book, but it\u2019s the last one I actually have in physical form. And so it\u2019s going to have to really impress me if I\u2019m to bother getting hold of the next ones..."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7325648-dan", "userReview": "This is the third book in the Henderson's Boys series, the prequel series to CHERUB. Unfortunately this is the obligatory \"training\" book of the series. If it were a video game, it would be the levels where you learn the controls but are keen to get through so you can play the exciting levels. Charles Henderson is training up his group of child spies but many of his superior officers are threatening to shut the unit down before it even gets going. Paul,Rosie, Marc and PT, along with new recruits Luc and Troy, are going to have to prove themselves to secure the future of the unit...I understand that this book was necessary as there had to be a period when the group were trained up. The trouble is that meant a lot of the best bits of the first two books were lost. The early books were CHERUB in World War II, an action story with a proper historical element. Without the historical element it didn't feel very different from the first CHERUB book, The Recruit. Muchamore tries to liven the book up with some interesting character stuff but it doesn't work too well. Troy is introduced here and then pretty much forgotten for the rest of the book. The main group is gradually becoming more professional, with Paul in particular becoming a little action hero. I hated Luc but appreciated the character- Henderson recognized that horrible people make good spies. And there's also a bit about Henderson and his wife which frankly felt rather out of place. An enjoyable enough read but a definite drop in drop in excitement from the first two books. Probably justified for the overall series plot though and I suspect the action really goes up a knot in the next few books."}, {"userName": "Lauren White", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51236877-lauren-white", "userReview": "I\u2019m not sure about this book.

As they have to find a way around the secret police (Gestapo)as well as the check points. This book is more about the training of the characters. I like the growing relationship between PT and Rosie and how Marc reminisces about the past and Jae. This book is done in two main section: The training at camp and the parachuting training. I preferred the parachute training section as it had more action and kept me more interested than the first part of the book had. The character all develop throughout the book especially Paul, who become a real dare devil. The parachute training section also see the relationship of the people in Group A change and I feel it is for the better. Overall this book was better than I did expected it to be but as it wasn't in France and the Fact that it wasn't until the final chapters that more action began and it became fast paced, that it only receives three stars.

Reading it straight through in an evening, pausing only to grab a drink or food. Well, that's what I did with this one because I literally couldn't put it down!The Henderson's Boys series is pretty much a prequel to the CHERUB series. CHERUB is an organisation that was set up by Charles Henderson during World War II, training youngsters to become secret agents - because no one suspects a kid. The first two books have had Henderson, along with a handful of war orphans, scuppering the Nazi's plans to envade England. they have now made it back to Britain and set up a training facility. Secret Army folllows the first lot of kids through their training and a final test which will enable them to be allowed to be dropped into occupied Europe on actual missions.Really great plot, combining the exciting adventure I've come to expect from this and the CHERUB books as well as loads of great detail about how the CHERUB organisation came to be."}, {"userName": "Nina", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23093957-nina", "userReview": "Done and dusted.

I am sorry, but that's just the way that I am. Like, no.So the best thing that happened in this books was that I found out what CHERUB stands for, it was wonderful to finally found out but kinda disappointing and random. SO yes. Not really worth you time, in my opinion. Seriously. I am not going to lie to you, because the truth is, I wish someone told me how bad it was before I READ THIS SERIES.
