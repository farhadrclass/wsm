There was so much in this book that resonated with and was similar to what we covered in my drawing class. The main lessons were: draw faster, draw bigger (gestural), draw the frame (contours), and worry about the details later. It reinforced the point that it is much better to start with a rough framing of the whole drawing than a very detailed small component of the drawing. I find that is true with any endeavor, whether it is writing a novel, to drawing a masterpiece, to designing a new product.... its much better to have a rough outline, sketch, or prototype of the whole thing than to have one perfect paragraph, one perfectly drawn blade of grass, or one perfect button. I'm glad I read this book."}, {"userName": "George Wang", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10417779-george-wang", "userReview": "http://dschool.stanford.edu/recommend..."}, {"userName": "Tricia Friedman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43986408-tricia-friedman", "userReview": "A good support text for those interested in visual note taking.
