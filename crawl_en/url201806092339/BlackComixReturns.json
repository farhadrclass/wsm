Or I guess I should say an art supply store.This collection features mostly indie artists, but of all mediums - digital or traditional, cartoon or realistic, full colour or monochrome, you name it.While it's true of any multi-artist gallery that some of the styles won't be my favourites, I can't deny that everyone in here has buckets of talent. Seriously, the work here is pure, gleaming eye candy and is fantastic. I also thought the essays featured were well-written, as well as important - especially the one regarding diversity and artists, and that while it's vital to have diversity in fiction, it's even more vital to have diversity with its creators.But just to add, it's not a book of short stories. They do talk about the books these artists have worked on or written, but there aren't many full comics featured. Most of the comics are snippets from larger works. That's not to say they aren't lovely, though.\nI received a free copy of this from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Cathy (cathepsut)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/978552-cathy-cathepsut", "userReview": "I had expected an anthology of short comics.

I still enjoyed it and I actually put several of the featured comics on my to-read list, but I find it difficult to give anything without a cohesive 'story' more than 3 stars. I know a lot of people like art books but for me this is more just 'something you read to figure out what else you want to actually read'. It's still an interesting book though and features a wide variety of art styles from many different genres and even features some webcomics and several essays about the comics industry as well.Bonus: this really made me laugh"}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1806073-alicia", "userReview": "What a beautiful collection highlighting black comix.

This is an art book. It\u2019s a fantastic art book. The only reason I\u2019m surprised is because I thought it was going to be a collection of comics - of stories, etc. But it actually highlights several comics artists and their work. And their work is wonderful. The great thing about this is the diversity of the work. There are superheroes, and indie comix, humor, high art, all kinds of stuff. These artists are amazingly talented. The trouble is, many of these are really hard to find. Wait, I take that back. They aren\u2019t too hard to find with a little bit of digging; I\u2019m just probably not going to find them at my local library or on Amazon. Except, I did read Joel Christian Gill\u2019s Strange Fruit from my library about 2 years ago - check it out; it\u2019s powerful, horrifying, and inspiring. Also retrieved from my library - Jeremy Love\u2019s Bayou was riveting - and was beautiful. I love Afua Richardson\u2019s art! I put World of Wakanda (written by Ta-Nehisi Coates) on hold at my library - she did the cover. And I\u2019m definitely going to check out Genius. And I just bought Whit Taylor\u2019s Ghost Stories! The first story in this book blew my mind! And I did read Black, by Kwanza Osajyefo, and which Jamal Igle did the interior art for. (Both of whom are in this book.) I thought Igle\u2019s black and white art was great - and the comic was an excellent commentary on our world. I wish I could have gotten in on the kickstarter for Is\u2019Nana the Were-Spider. Matthew Clarke\u2019s work looks amazing - especially Hardears. I\u2019d love to read DayBlack by Keef Cross. I can\u2019t believe I just passed on volume 2 on NetGalley! (H)Afrocentric by Juliana \u201cJewels\u201d Smith looks interesting. And I\u2019ll be checking out C. Spike Trotman\u2019s work! I may have to get Dave Crosland\u2019s Ego Rehab. I\u2019m also going to have to check out Tony Puryear\u2019s Concrete Park. Stacey Robinson\u2019s Kid Code: Channel Zero looks surreal. I\u2019m going to have to pick that up for my girlfriend. Also, Niobe: She is Life by Ashley A. Woods. The essays were wonderful, too. I loved Enrique Carrion\u2019s essay Comics as Hip-Hop. And Brandon Thomas\u2019s You Have to Buy It really hit home. I\u2019m going to be purchasing some of these. And at the end is a list of conventions and events \u201c\u2026dedicated to highlighting and celebrating the black and brown creators, characters, and content\u2026\u201dThanks to NetGalley and Diamond Book Distributors for a copy in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Pop Bop", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5292621-pop-bop", "userReview": "\"Representation and Inclusion\"This is like a huge, grand gallery show of the widest possible selection of black independent comics artists. It is a followup of sorts to Jennings and Duffy's wildly successful 2010 art book, \"Black Comix: African American Independent Comics Art & Culture\".This time around we survey the work of over 40 artists, some established and some up and coming. Each artist gets a two or three page spread with examples of past and current projects. There are also very brief and sort of idiosyncratic bios. As I say, it's a survey and a sampler, and a jumping off point for looking for more work from artists who really catch your eye. Peppered amongst the collected art you will find various essays addressing different aspects of the craft. The curators of this book have distinguished scholarly credentials and numerous academic works to their credit, but the emphasis here is more celebratory than scholarly. The work is of almost unimaginable variety - there is humor, anger, action, romance, superheroics, history, myth, legend, urban grit, bayou wonder, struggle, victory, and defeat. The tone of the various essays is aspirational and encouraging. The point, one of many, is to invite struggling black artists to enter and to remain in the fray, and to make their work visible and viable. The effect is inspiring and the work itself eye-opening and wonderful. A great find.

Want to diversify your reading list? Looking for some STUNNING art by African-American creators? You've come to the right place: Black Comix Returns is collection of illustrations, comic strips, and essays by black artists. Tbh, when I cracked this open, I was expecting to find an anthology of sorts, maybe a sampling of stories from up-and-and coming graphic novelists. This is almost as good, though: while we only get the briefest glimpse into the imaginations of each of the ninety-three artists featured in these here pages, nearly every two-page spread will leave you wanting more. Many of the illustrations are simply breathtaking, and the series descriptions had me adding titles to my Amazon wishlist like it was going out of style. The cover, easily one of the most jaw-dropping I've ever seen, is just a taste of the visual delights you can expect to find inside. Additionally, the essays interspersed throughout give an added layer of context, exploring what it's like to be an artist - and fan - in an overwhelmingly white (male) industry. Black Comix Returns isn't necessarily the sort of book you read cover-to-cover, but do yourself a favor and make sure you hit all the essays. I read Black Comix Returns as a pdf, but I'm sure it makes one helluva coffee table book. According to its Goodreads listing, the first title - Black Comix, which has since gone out of print - is somewhat of a collector's item on ebay. The $29.99 list price of Black Comix Returns seems like a steal in comparison. http://www.easyvegan.info/2018/02/20/..."}, {"userName": "Diane Hernandez", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20456668-diane-hernandez", "userReview": "Good survey of black comic artists by the creators of Kindred.Black Comix Returns contains a short biography and representative art from over 70 comic artists of color. Both established and emerging talents are showcased. Most of the artists have the plot of one of their comics or graphic novels summarized too. There are also short essays about being non-white and/or non-male in a white male controlled industry.While this book would be a great gift for any comic/graphic novel fan, it is especially useful to young artists. Not only empowering to kids of color, the varying styles of art within this collection show the sheer volume of choices available to young artists. From manga to fine art to illustration to newspaper comics, the variety is impressive. Most readers will find several artists interesting enough to locate at their comic book store, local library or online.Initially, I thought this was more of an anthology of short comics than the survey of black comic artists. I would have preferred more in depth coverage of each artist. However, I did find several artists to look into further.Thanks to the publisher, Lion Forge, and NetGalley for an advanced copy."}, {"userName": "June", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20234777-june", "userReview": "Confession: I left comics behind in my early teenage years. Not that I read extensively. And I was not interested in superheroes style, as it seemed to require that I catch up with long series. I figured that comics were for childhood. But then due to YouTube most people seem to read some sort of graphic novel. And after a while your biases can slide. Picked up Maus and March Book 1, and eager to find my own aesthetic. I picked up this anthology on Black Comic never knowing there was a prior version. This does not provide you with short comic strips which based on marketing suggests. This is more a who\u2019s who in comic industry both mainstream and independent. Perfect for newbies as a resource material as well as for avid fan looking for new artists to read. I like the mix of writers, cartoonist, and the essays included. Whilst not every style will be to your liking, you should be sure to bookmark a few comics to find.

I was wrong but I'm still not disappointed. There are tiny glimpses into the different graphic novels and artists that are featured but this is more of a guide of where to find stories involving black characters or artists. There are a few series in here that I'm actually quite excited about and the misunderstanding at the start was entirely my own. Even so, this is an excellent guide and introduction to some amazing artistry. For those who follow my reviews for family-friendly advice, there is a bit of swearing and violence in here but only as descriptions to series. For the actual series'themselves, I can't comment without reading the individual series, as always. Either way, if you're looking for some diversity in a vastly white-washed graphic world, this is definitely a great start to your journey.

This new edition is considerably larger (not just thicker and filled with more up-to-date information, but physically larger) which makes the art pop even more. Most of essays about each creator are simple one paragraph descriptions of their style and some of the projects they've worked on. These little paragraph pops left me wanting more, but, hey, I know how Google works, I can get the rest of the information that way. The longer essays within the book taught me a bunch of things about creators that I hadn't previously heard, which makes this the most useful essay book on comic creators that I've read.I recommend it to anyone looking to read more comics, particularly by Black creators.

We all look for ourselves in what we read, even if we are trying to escape. We like to think that if we find someone like us, that looks like us, or is from our part of the country, or talks like us, or is any way like us, that we can project ourselves into this world of make believe.Later, of course, as I grew up, I looked at what was then called the Underground comics, to find people more like me, that thought the way I did. It was the time when women were drawing their own comics, and I was, again drawn to that.Representation, anywhere is important. We need to see ourselves in books and stories, so that we feel part of it. When we see women in power, we know we too can grow up to have power. When people of color see themselves in books and stories, they feel more engaged. So that is why this book is so important, although it is more of a taste than anything else. There are so many great artists, so many different styles out there, it makes you want to go and seek all of them out. Amazing stuff.The only problem with this collection, as some of the reviewers pointed out, is that there is not enough of each artist. That it is only a taste, and we need more than that.
