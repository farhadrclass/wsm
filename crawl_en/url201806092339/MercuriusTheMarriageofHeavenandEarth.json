It\u2019s sort of like including an explanation for the meaning of a poem \u2014 a real nose-wrinkler. In this case, Patrick Harpur claims to have received the contents of Mercurius from an ex-girlfriend, Eileen. He has presented her commentary alongside its inspiration, the (ca. early 1950s) laboratory notes of John Smith, a man who used to live in the vicarage she, for a time, rented. Harpur\u2019s voice ostensibly comes to us only in the form of brief clarifications within the text and longer footnotes at the end.The thing is, anyone remotely familiar with alchemy \u2014 and I can\u2019t imagine anyone who isn\u2019t deeply interested in the subject slogging through this very dense novel \u2014 will appreciate the conceit. The Great Work varies widely from one manuscript to the next, but unverifiable provenance in the form of, say, a conveniently deceased teacher is perhaps the philosophers\u2019 stone\u2019s favorite mode of transmission. \u201cTo study alchemy\u201d, Harpur rightly asserts, \u201cis to travel in time\u201d (261).He deserves praise not merely for this sly nod to history. Harpur obviously did a tremendous amount of research, getting caught up (or so I imagine) like Eileen in the labyrinth of alchemical language, the weighty realization that, whatever we may think of them today, alchemists were onto something. From Maria Prophetissa to Fulcanelli, he compiles compelling anecdotes in a clear, accessible, respectful way, providing context for his very realistic fictional account of alchemy.Smith is carefully crafted, focused, flawed and all too fallible \u2014 nevertheless, we root for him, for his success, for the happiness of some parishioners and the failed schemes of others. His mental acuity is matched by his efforts in the vicarage cellar-cum-laboratory; appropriately, his own inner state mirrors the physical transformations as they take place. Eileen, by contrast, initially comes across as a creature of the mind. She analyzes Smith\u2019s efforts from a Jungian perspective, bringing structural anthropology and her own disastrous relationship with P. (our author, naturally) into the mix. At times I struggled to maintain the level of attention that her portion of the text required, probably because I\u2019m far more interested in the reality of alchemy and its practitioners than retrospective attempts to map it onto theoretical systems that do not quite fit. Still, she acknowledges such difficulties and her comments are insightful.Together these two characters form the heart (the backbone, the Spirit, even) of Mercurius, but the supporting cast lends a richness to the story that I hadn\u2019t expected as connections between the dual narratives emerge, because of course the alchemical process is steeped in relationships and the changes they endure. Perhaps the most beautiful moments in the book mark one character\u2019s recognition of another, not the imagined other but the truth:\"Her pale eyelashes give her a myopic look; but her eyes, as I realise for the first time, are sharp. We watch her husband and sister perform their mincing curtseying little mating-dance around Caldwell who expands fatly, his self-congratulatory gestures fanning outwards like a peacock's tail. She sees me thinking that the two of them are more like a married couple than she and Simmons; she sees that I am sorry for her just as I see that she is sorry for me, having to put a good face on the snubs I receive. I touch her shoulder lightly to distract her from a sight that is painful to both of us, and I feel bone not flesh. She also understands from my touch that she has no need to feel sorry for me; that I have other resources (as perhaps she has) which disqualify me as an object of pity. We humans are so wonderful \u2014 so complex and quick that all this, and more, can pass between two of them in a flash, so subtle that it passes undetected by anyone else.\" (164)And another, even lovelier in its brevity:\u201cHer hand in mine was perfectly still. We sat on, silent, cramped on the narrow stair as the house grew dark. I thought of all that had happened. Feeling her hand, I thought how different Nora was from the one I believed I knew. How much more mysterious, unpredictable, wonderful, the real Nora was.\u201d (329)Plenty of snap judgments rendered empty, expectations thwarted, learning more about ourselves and others through the course of our interactions, all this mirrored in the laboratory, which needn't be seen simply as a symbol or metaphor. I loved it.This book deserves a far more extensive review than I have the time to write, but at the very least I can recommend it highly to folks interested in alchemy. I preferred this to Lindsay Clarke\u2019s worthy Whitbread Prize-winning alchemical novel The Chymical Wedding, which came out a year earlier \u2014 more convincing, compelling and, I'll wager, though time will tell more surely, memorable."}, {"userName": "Laura LVD", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40921360-laura-lvd", "userReview": "This is not a novel. Or, this is not just a novel. It is a fictional account of an alchemist and his quest and someone who discovers his writings in the future. But the story of the characters is interlaced with analysis of different aspects of the alchemical works, the Opus, and descriptions of the work itself. This book has to be read in a certain state of mind, and it is no light read. I had to pay a lot of attention to try to grasp the multiple levels of meaning of this book- a task that will take me, i think, several rereadings."}, {"userName": "Tim Pendry", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1016626-tim-pendry", "userReview": "I would call this book a magnificent failure and yet it has many fine qualities, not least genuine learning and some exceptional novelistic writing. So why is it a failure?Harpur (as perhaps only those who read to the very end, and I mean to the very end but no cheating please or there really is no point in starting the book) has a little bit of the Loki in him.That trickster element is, I think, the thing that redeems the work. He certainly 'seems' (who knows) to want to engage the reader with alchemical thought and its Jungian analogue as sincere attempts at self-individuation.Failing to resolve the issues raised by analogical thinking in any way, perhaps because he does not want to and perhaps because he cannot, he then falls into the double trap of obscurity and didacticism in style.That seems harsh but a full half of the book, perhaps more, is made up of material about alchemical theory and practice that you would expect to find on the non-fiction shelves - with foot notes.In producing this material in this way and then offsetting it against not merely one narrative but two, with layers of narrative within the narrative in the 'best' tradition of the 'modern' novel, he creates something that will certainly appeal to some. I find it overly manipulative for my taste. There is something deeply conservative and priestly, almost obscurantist about the tone of this book.However, that 'spiritual' position is constantly being subverted by the evident lies, half-truths and delusions peppered through the fictional element and, as I will argue, nothing can be taken at face value when it comes to the values expressed in the work.Is it all one fiction masquerading as truth, a game worthy of Calvino (who we do not admire)? After all, Calvino famously used the Tarot to similar effect. As a literary game, it is a remarkable achievement. But as a trick played on the lonely reader, it may be cruel. The alchemical element is not merely obscure but holds out the promise of some hidden meaning of spiritual value that cannot be honoured.This is dangled like a fishermen dangles his bait on a rod, only to make spirituality, actually obscurantism, the cloak for a degree of literary manipulation that may help no one.So let us move on to the fiction which is tricksy and a suitable offset to the two embedded interpretations of the alchemical - the traditional and the psychological.The difference is that we expect manipulation in fiction so we can be far more relaxed when it is out in the open by being hidden in a story. Harpur is extremely good at creating credible characters in the Reverend Smith and Eileen, from different generations but interlinked by their role in other unreliable narratives, most notably that of Bradley and Nora.Forget the detail (read the book). He draws us persuasive pictures of two types of over-intellualised, sexually repressed and confused English - the mid-century middle class male and the rising bluestocking of the generation that followed.They are, in fact, archetypes. You would not imediately think so from this tale told of English country life but this is a mildly decadent Ambridge riddled with symbolism, sinking into the water table, with pagan fertility stones on the high hills and sacred woods that aren't.The novel refers back to the long tradition of literary intellectuals observing the ways of the country folk and that contains Hardy and folk horror within it. At times, I was reminded of John Cowper Powys, another writer who mixes magical thinking with close attention to character detail. There is even the violent country mob which so terrifies the urban bourgeoisie and is found as a recurrent image in the horror genre.It is true that when he has his two main characters speak in their non-fiction voice, he manages to de-nature them and nearly turn them into one and the same authorial voice with different angles on alchemy but when they are back 'in the world', the world that they live in appears very real and finely observed indeed.There are significant minor characters - a suicidal artist, a catholic woman of passion trapped in a loveless marriage, Eileen's father who clearly has secret sexual vice and an inability to analyse his own condition.Whether these are avatars of the author I do not know but he builds up a set of archetypes of traditional English twentieth century culture which slyly gives us a full picture of sexual repression, well meaning self-destructive stupidity and finely tuned cultural evasion.The intellectual engagements of the neurotic Smith and Eileen provide a clever (though is it wholly intended?) dissection of a race of people forced to dance in a conformist socially directed ballet that is just 'not enough' for them at heart.Perhaps all peoples in all cultures find in their souls that what is before them is not enough but the literary English middle classes are peculiarly adept at a sort of spiritual mending and making do expressed in their country Anglicanism and Oxbridge academicism.I take the book as an attempt to unpack this culture and this class and its search for meaning (and its lack of courage to be direct about that search, seeking it in acceptable analogical thinking) that may or may not be an unfolding in the author himself - who can possibly know except the author!The book is a significant achievement in destabilising the assumptions of a whole culture and it does so in ways that are not cruel at all unless you take content at face value. If you do, it is cruel.The fictional persons are considered with compassion and there is a desire to love within this book that rises above the trickery. There does not appear to be the cynicism that purely formal literary writers tend to offer us.I will not go much further because this is a book that has to be judged through reading rather than through the sort of intellectualism that acts as a carapace for Eileen who may or may not be as nutty as a fruit cake. Any cruelty only lies in the unfulfilled expectation for the spiritual searcher who expects omething consoling in this novel, the sort of vulnerable searcher to be found in every nook and cranny of the educated middle classes. I think such people need a bit more brutal honesty in their lives and to be shaken out of their cocoon. What they do not need is to be is to be led into a maze. This book and its literary brothers and sisters tend to discomfit a little but leave people in their hole.Perhaps losing yourself in analogical speculation and theory - whether alchemical or Jungian - might get you out of that spiritual hole but I don't think so. In the end, it just gives you a better 'ole. Still a better 'ole may be all that you really want, like moving up the spiritual property ladder.The book's message (for me) is that, in fact, such thinking is likely to be merely palliative, an evasion as likely to end in madness, failure and fantasy as it is to find a workable way to some sort of wholeness by removing the detritus of what our history and culture has left us with. It is a way of coping, not overcoming.Still, it is a stimulating and valuable book, frustrating perhaps because you really do not know what the author intends but perhaps that is the point. You should not really expect any writer of texts to solve your problems for you."}, {"userName": "Chris Lowe", "userReviewDate": "Aug 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5743864-chris-lowe", "userReview": "A brilliantly written and masterful book dealing with complex and little known Alchemical processes and explaining them beautifully. Some of my letter to the author is below:Hello PatrickIn my 60 years I have never written to an author before. I recently finished (if one could ever finish) Mercurius and I am spell bound by it. Apart from my dabblings with Crowley and the Thoth deck I knew little of Alchemy and I admit to still not having a total grasp on all that you wrote; however your characters became so real and the story so engaging that I was drawn to greedily devour every word, as I am sure I will do again and perhaps again.When the Beatles suggested Paul was dead I never believed it; I am not drawn to conspiracy theories and only pretended to believe in the tooth fairy to get the shiny sixpences... (A)lthough this work is described as fiction I suspect that the soul of the book is based on actual events, perhaps embellished, perhaps not. The skilful and caring way in which the characters are drawn, your wonderful use of footnotes in which some of this suggestion of actuality takes place is breathtaking.Congratulations on a wonderful book Patrick...Sorry about the gushing,Chris"}, {"userName": "Sakhi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29693756-sakhi", "userReview": "There are few novels like this. This is the second time I've read it, the first being a few years after its 1990 publication date. I was attracted by themes of alchemy, hidden histories and love, but my mind was not quite ready for the more dense psychological and obscure details about the Art. Perhaps I only managed to finish it due to my teenage search for an adult magic. 20 years later it turned up as a Christmas present (thanks mum!) and I was soon enthralled by it.

It has been out of print for many years and until the release of this brand new edition was as rare as hen's teeth, with some old copies fetching prices of up to USD $600.00. This new edition features a beautiful new cover and has been revised and updated by the author. Know this: I, Mercurius, have set down a full, true and infallible account of the Great Work. But I give you fair warning that unless you seek the true philosophical gold and not the gold of the vulgar; unless your heart is fixed with unbending intent on the true Stone of the Philosophers, unless you are steadfast in your quest, abiding by God s laws in all faith and humility and eschewing all vanity, conceit, falsehood, intemperance, pride, lust and faintheartedness, read no further lest I prove fatal to you. In 1952 a country clergyman called Smith begins his tortuous quest for the Holy Grail of alchemy - the Philosophers' Stone which transmutes base metal to gold and confers immortality. As he pits himself against the bizarre perils of the GreatWork, it becomes clear that his arcane transformations are as much spiritual as chemical. Gradually the shadow of alchemy falls over those around him; a young girl whose sudden pregnancy is a local scandal; Janet, trapped in a barren marriage; and Robert who pursues his own quest for the legendary blue glass of Chartres. Thirty years later, Eileen comes to live in Smith's vicarage. In the medieval cellar she unearths a hidden manuscript and begins to read of secret fire and mysterious prime matter, a green lion and a raven's head, a fatal conjunction of king and queen, a descent into Blackness and putrefaction. As she penetrates farther into the alchemical labyrinth, she is haunted both by her own history and by that of her neighbours, the menacing Mrs Zetterberg and the disfigured Pluto - and, finally, by the enigma of Smith himself. In separate but interwoven accounts, Smith and Eileen strive towards the one thing necessary for the Work's success -the great Secret guarded by the paradoxical Mercurius, who leads them to the zero point where Heaven is wedded to Earth and the miraculous Stone appears at the intersection of time and eternity. By reconstructing a highly sophisticated but almost forgotten world-view, Mercurius restores to us our own spiritual heritage which, rooted in the alchemists' dark retorts, will perhaps flower in the light of the future.", "title": "Mercurius: The Marriage of Heaven and Earth", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1908088.Mercurius", "average": 4.34, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1336667489l/1908088.jpg", "reviews": 11, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/356586.Patrick_Harpur", "name": "Patrick Harpur"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Occult", "Esoterica", "Fantasy", "Psychology"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1908088.Mercurius", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1908089.Mercurius", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8100485-mercurius", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/920181.Daimonic_Reality", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/664216.The_Philosophers_Secret_Fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10613460-the-secret-tradition-of-the-soul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8100486-a-complete-guide-to-the-soul", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3024060-the-serpent-s-circle"]}
