I think that anyone who believes that hasn\u2019t paid enough attention to what we are actually like. That\u2019s one of the big reasons that I\u2019m loving this series. It shows that people suck whether they\u2019re on Earth, Mars, a moon, an asteroid, a spaceship, or exploring an alien construct built by an ancient protomolecule. This third book in the Expanse series picks up shortly after the events of the last one. James Holden and his small crew of misfits continue to earn a living by hiring out the Rocinante as a transport or escort ship around the solar system. The governments of Earth, Mars, and the Belt have all sent ships out towards the mysterious giant ring that the protomolecule cobbled together that is now outside the orbit of Uranus. (Feel free to make your own Uranus jokes.) As you\u2019d expect the three rival powers are spending as much time watching and scheming against each other as they are trying to figure out exactly what the ring is.Holden wants nothing more to do with the protomolecule, especially since he\u2019s having some freaky episodes that are apparently connected to it, so he tries to get them a job that will take them as far away from the ring as the Rocinante can get. Unfortunately, he\u2019s got an enemy named Clarissa who thinks Holden is responsible for her family\u2019s misfortune, and she manipulates events to get him near the ring where she can destroy his reputation and kill him. As usual with this series we\u2019ve got Holden and his crew as the on-going hero characters while some new people are introduced. Clarissa is a key figure, and her desire for revenge, extensive resources, and some illegal implants that give her a limited amount of berserker fury make her a very dangerous figure. Carlos \u2018Bull\u2019 c de Baca is the security chief on the main Outer Planets Alliance ship sent to the ring, but his loyalty to the leader of the OPA means that he\u2019s been secretly given the responsibility of making sure that the ship\u2019s idiot captain doesn\u2019t screw things up. Pastor Anna Volovodov leaves her wife and child behind to go to the ring as part of an Earth delegation made up of religious figures and artists to try and figure out the significance of the ring to humanity from a spiritual standpoint.As I noted before, one of the things I love about this series is how it sets up the idea that even with the terrifying and astounding things that have happened because of the protomolecule that the different factions of people scattered around the solar system still spend most of their time focused on squabbling with each other and looking for an angle to use the alien tech for their own purposes. That remains one of the key drivers to the plot, and it\u2019s all too easy to believe that when confronted with something huge and scary that people would rather fight with each other than think about what it actually means.Another aspect that I enjoy about Expanse is that it at least nods towards real science in that if you\u2019re going to create a story in which spaceships can go fast enough to make travel within our solar system feasible, then that means you\u2019ve got to account for the force of that on the human bodies in those ships. That\u2019s built into these books with special gel couches and drugs having to be used to offset thrusts that cause high g-forces, and those forces get used to catastrophic effect in ways that are horrifyingly clever. When you\u2019ve got people casually referring to how someone got turned into pasta sauce, you know things have gotten ugly.The only off note is in how the book gets pretty black and white with the good guys vs. the bad guys. I\u2019d complained before that the first two books had the heroes facing off against a shadowy conspiracy with no indications from their side what the plan was so it made the threat kind of vague and cartoonish. Here, we know that one big threat comes from Clarissa, and we get plenty on her motivations and her schemes. The other thing endangering everyone is the scared and stupid behavior of small minded people, and that\u2019s also a relatable idea.However, when things go sideways it seems like all the good guys line up on the same side immediately, and there\u2019s no doubt whatsoever that they\u2019re way is the right way even though with the information available the other side isn\u2019t entirely out of line. It would have been nice to get a few more grey areas or some doubts creeping in rather than having almost everyone lining up along exact battle lines and sticking to that for the most part.That was a minor point and didn\u2019t detract much from the overall enjoyment I continue to get out of this ambitious space opera with it\u2019s all too human characters."}, {"userName": "Per Gunnar", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6691401-per-gunnar", "userReview": "I do not think I have read a book series before which have gone from really great to really disappointing in one go like this one just did. There is nothing wrong with the writing itself. It is as good as before. It is the content, the story itself, which is simply disappointing as far as I am concerned.Apart from Holden and his crew all the nice characters from the previous book like Bobby and the likable bitch Avasarala are gone. The new ones introduced are nowhere near those that we lost in terms of interest and often downright annoying. Miller was brought back but he is not really the old Miller, not surprisingly, and more of a tool than an interesting character.I was hoping that we would get more into the mystery of the protomolecule device and of course it plays an important part in the story but more as a piece of background or a prop than the centerpiece that I hoped it would. The events in the book are, at least initially, driven by a crazy and fanatical relative to the bad guy Mao from the previous book and who wants to both kill and discredit Holden for revenge. I was not too crazy about that from the start. Once her plan get going things goes bad rather quickly.As if this revenge business was not bad enough the author drags in a useless as well as volatile and half-crazy captain, appointed for pretty much nothing but political reasons, and a whole bunch of more or less fanatical religious people. The latter was really dragging down the book for me.Unfortunately the religious fanatics play a big role in the events in the latter half of the book and, not surprisingly, they cause things to go from bad to worse. Even the good ones of these priests and clerics is really ruining the book with their constant nonsensical preaching about how there were still some good in person x and person y etc. etc. and how we should try to talk to him instead of using violence. The maniac(s) are on the verge of, possibly, exterminating the human race for Christ sake! Just push the f-ckers out of a bloody airlock and be done with it.I have to say that I am probably not really capable of giving a un-biased, possibly not even a fair, review of this book since I am so disappointed with it, especially given how much I liked the previous ones. It is a well written book. Those of you who liked the previous ones should probably have a go at this one as well. I did not like it but that is because of personal taste more than anything."}, {"userName": "Carol.

It truly was not even close to a 5 star effort. I for one am shocked at the bollocks the authors made of things in this, the third part of The Expanse.Where do I start ?The first two books were truly brilliant, and Caliban's War ended with a dandy of a cliffhanger with the protomolecule in full threat and Miller making his mysterious comeback. With regards to taking advantage of the protomolecule threat, and all of the plot potential, Abbadon's Gate fell flat on it's arse. Holden investigated the protomolecule, but nothing really came of it. It felt like an entirely useless exercise. The entire Clarissa / Melba character was riddled with question marks, contradictions, nothing made much sense about her.There were key points in the story that were \"no way that is happening\" scenes. Like Reverend Anna \"all of a sudden\" showing up on the Roci just as Naomi was about to get murdered by Clarissa. Yes, how convenient that a pastor had jet-packed across from a starship to a corvette just in time to save a woman from a pyschopath. How very believable.And the ending, my God, the ending. It was like Abraham and Franck were wrapping this sucker up as fast as they could, and were running out of time on this one. Did they have a page limit or something ? I'm still not clear how Asheford was taken out in the last fight scene, and or how Clarissa was taken out either. Was it during the final Miller appearance ? And then of course everything gift wraps / fast forwards millions of kilometres OUT of the Ring, not even answering the question IS THE RING NOW GONE, to everyone jetting happily home. I do declare.This book was a shambles.

I've been actively anticipating it for the past few months. I've been hungering after it for the past week or so. So, with all those high expectations, did Abaddon's Gate live up to my hopes?Why, yes. Yes, it did.It had everything I could hope for in a science fiction novel. Great characters: check. Great worldbuilding: check. Awesome journeys through the depths of space into mysterious... things: check. Pulse-pounding, heart-racing, breakneck action: check. Ruminations on morality and the human experience: check.This is the sort of book that makes me enjoy SF: a book that transports me to a fascinating new world and gets me thinking along the way. I'm running out of ways to express how much I enjoyed this book, so here's what I want you to do. Whatever you're doing, stop. Just go pick this book up. Don't bother finishing this review. Just sit your ass down and read. Abandon whatever else you're doing and start reading. You can thank me later."}, {"userName": "Apatt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2457095-apatt", "userReview": "I should keep this short really, I have a feeling that when people see a review of book #3 of a series they have not read they tend to find something better to do with their time and move on. So I guess this review is quite a niche. Ok, that should leave maybe a couple of review readers - hello mum! :)So Abaddon's Gate is volume 3 of the popular space operatic Expanse series. I was not that big a fan of volume 1  Leviathan Wakes, but that all changed after watching the Syfy adaptation and reading volume 2  Caliban's War. If you had told me a year ago that I would be reading volume 3 of this series I would have thought you were a very strange sort of clairvoyant, to be predicting what people will read in a year's time, and opined that your supernatural gift should be more productively employed.After the thrilling conclusion of  Caliban's War our heroes, the motley cr\u00fce of the spaceship Rocinante find themselves to be quite well to do and are having fun drinking vintage wine and gambling with gleeful abandon. If this nice state of affairs was to persist throughout the book the readers would bin it en mass and used bookshops would be flooded with discarded copies. So, predictably, things soon turn pear shaped for our heroes and even humanity as a whole. The Rocinante (from Syfy's adaptation)In the previous book, the inscrutable \u201cprotomolecule\u201d aliens the have crash-landed on Venus and soon create a weird gigantic ring, 1000 km in diameter, and launched into orbit. In the meantime, the Rocinante is on the run from a pursuing ship from Earth, another one from Mars, and yet another one from the OPA (Outer Planet Alliance), for a heinous crime they did not commit. Their only chance is to go through the mysterious Ring, once they are through that, they find that the law of physics has changed, the aliens have imposed a very slow top speed of 600 meters per second for space flight. The absent aliens have left a space station behind. Any object exceeding the maximum speed allowed is pulled into the space station\u2019s orbit to become a sort of useless space flotsam. Soon, some humans visit the space station and start getting trigger-happy when threatened by the station\u2019s security system. This caused the station to not only kill most of the human visitors but also drag all four ships into the station\u2019s orbit and disable their drives.This is another thrilling installment in the Expanse series. It is action-packed with plenty of hair-raising escapades and last stands, and last minute rescues. On the plus side Abaddon's Gate has well-developed, complex characters with believable motivation, and the series world building is top notched. My only complaint is that the novel focuses almost entirely on the human conflicts, at the expense of exploring the alien mystery. I wanted to know more about their technology, biology, culture etc. The fighting among the human factions is exciting stuff but there is nothing new about such conflicts. I would rather be rooting for the good guys against an alien threat than against human fascists. Another little snag is that two awesome characters from  Caliban's War, Chrisjen Avasarala and Bobbie Draper, are entirely absent, and they are very much missed. However, the writing team of \u201cJames S.A. Corey\u201d are great at creating compelling characters so there is some compensation from some colorful new characters. Particularly Pastor Anna who starts off as a rather bland, generic pious Christian type but when she is under pressure to save innocent lives she shows admirable resolve, strength of character and moral fortitude. \u201cShe was beautiful too. Beautiful and terrible and uncompromising in her compassion. It was in her face. It made her hard to look at.\u201dAnother character starts off as an antagonist but has a somewhat unbelievable sudden change of heart. Fortunately, I am a sucker for a nice redemption story and quite enjoyed her character arc, unbelievability notwithstanding. So another entertaining volume of the Expanse series under the bridge then. It falls a bit short of the previous volume\u2019s excellence but more than good enough to keep me committed to the series. I am also excited that by the end of this book the series has reached a pivotal point where the setting is no longer restricted to the \"intersolar\" space and has become interstellar.  Cibola Burn next then!"}, {"userName": "John Carter McKnight", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2410586-john-carter-mcknight", "userReview": "I'm simply gobsmacked. The first two volumes were terrific and really good respectively, but they didn't prepare me for the gut-wrenching brilliance of this volume. This deserves to be ranked as one of the classics of military SF, religious SF and space opera, all at once. The characterization here is stunning: one of the viewpoint characters is the \"main villain,\" and if there were nothing but her internal perspective, this would be some first-rate writing. Add on the trilogy heroes, a lesbian priest discovering there's more to her than small-town ministry, and you get something amazing beyond words.This is a mediation on the role of violence, of political legitimacy, of the nature of grace and forgiveness, handled more deftly than in works advertising that they're Saying Something Important. Very astute readers may catch the Chekhov's Gun when it's presented. I laughed out loud when it went off, as it had slipped right past me, and surfaced again wrapped in layer upon layer of psychological meaning. A brilliant bit of craft and far from the only one in the book.The only nit I'd pick is that one of the \"villains\" lacks the layered moral nuance of even the other secondary and tertiary characters, and verges into cartoonishness: showing this person not being a perfect jackass at every opportunity would've helped.Otherwise? This is what SF is for, telling a rollicking adventure with galactic-scale consequences that's really about humanity's oldest questions about itself."}, {"userName": "Darnell", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/896794-darnell", "userReview": "Wait! Wait! Something doesn't make sense. (Spoilers)If the alien computer system created a \"slow zone\" that changed the laws of physics and created a speed limit, then a Marine lobbed a grenade at an alien security thing which caused the speed limit to instantly change which lead to so horrific casualties in the human fleet because nothing could move faster than a lobbed grenade, then how in the hell is the final third of the book a huge gun battle? Did I miss the part where Miller made bullets exempt from slow zone limitations?Abaddon's Gate was disappointing after the first books gave us so many unexpected surprises and great characters. I missed Bobbie and Avasarala (but thankfully no Prax) and didn't quite warm up to the new folks. Particularly Melba/Clarissa, who was hell-bent on avenging her awful father (which made no sense) then was foiled rather early (and easily because she wasn't outwitted, she just ran out of steam), then wandered around for a long time only to do a total heel-face turn. Also lacking payoff was the protomolecule. In the first book it made zombies, then it became a horrible force on Venus that destroyed starships. Then it flew off and created...a Stargate? A Stargate that leads to a sentient hub that turns Miller into a ghost in Holden's head. No, wait. Miller's an AI avatar for the hub who needs Holden to control the system. Wait, no. Holden wasn't necessary, Miller controls the system all along. Except when he can't. You get my drift, this was half cooked mythology.But don't worry, its not important. Because Abaddon's Gate is less about the protomolecule's transformative effect on humanity and more about the power struggle shenanigans of an undisciplined OPA crew, led by LT Coffey from The Abyss. Fred Johnson all but tells Bull that he's going on the mission because the Behemoth is ran by idiots. So Bull proceeds to play the Captain and XO against each other. The shit hits the fan, Bull incites a coup. In order for us to be okay with the the Captain loses his fucking mind for no go reason! and starts a counter-coup by killing every likable member of his crew. This causes the final third of the book to turn into an ultra violent version of Crimson Tide. It goes on too long, makes little sense and detracts from the mystery of the Stargates. Our heroes have to stop the cartoonishly insane Captain from destroying the Stargate and at the resolution of it all Miller tells Holden the gate wouldn't have been harmed. Well thanks, Miller! Where were you 10 chapters ago?I loved the first two books and the universe created. I would like to see more adventures of the Rocinante. But Abaddon's Gate was an unsatisfying misstep. This series works when action set pieces are born out of sci-fi mysteries. Here was a book about bickering humans ignoring much greater things outside their viewwports. And that's just not fun to read."}, {"userName": "Algernon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4728718-algernon", "userReview": "If humanity were capable of being satisfied, then they'll still be living in trees and eating bugs out of one another's fur. Anna had walked on a moon of Jupiter. She'd look up through a dome-covered sky at the great red spot, close enough to see the swirls and eddies of a storm larger than her home world. She'd tasted water thawed from ice as old as the solar system itself. And it was that human dissatisfaction, that human audacity that had put her there. Book three of the Expanse series offers a reminder that space opera aims at being more than a fun adventure among the stars, that it addresses and defines our humanity by the impulse to explore new frontiers. When the last white blot on the maps of the Earth disappeared, it was the turn of the neighboring planets and later of the whole Galaxy to fire up the imagination of the restless and the daring explorers.A quick reminder of the first two books in the series: it is centered in the Solar System, in the not-too-distant future, proposing a society based still on a mega-corporatist economic system and on military power projection that resulted in three major players on the political scene. The Earth United Nations battles for supremacy with the Inner Planets while the Outer Planets Alliance (OPA) struggles for recognition and independence. An alien artefact / artificial intelligence enters the scene first as a deadly virus producing space zombies, latter as a terraforming agent mysteriously altering the planet Venus. At the start of this third book, the alien has morphed into a BDO (Big Dumb Object) of the kind made popular in the books of Arthur C Clarke or David Niven: a gigant circular structure, purpose unknown, orbiting around Uranus. All three major Solar Powers send ships to investigate the artefact after it is revealed it might be a portal to worlds unknown. (and not quite as dumb as you might expect)The book was a little slower in gaining momentum than the precedent ones, but once it got up to speed it achieved the high quality standard I have come to expect from this Daniel Abraham - Ty Franck collaboration. I'll start with my grumbling, in order to get it out the way and concentrate on the good parts. Because the authors decided at the start that each book should stand on its own feet with a self-contained plot there is only one major POV character carrying over from the previous encounters (Holden) and three new ones to get familiar with (Bull, Melba / Clarissa, Anna). Building them up, presenting their background and putting them in the larger context of the expedition takes care of the first half of the novel. I considered characterization one of the best selling points of the series until now, but frankly I didn't much care for the new actors at the start, and I only partially got involved in their troubles by the end:- Melba is a stereotypical villain who doesn't even manage to stay consistently in character until the end- Ann is a hollier than thou white knight that needed a couple of flaws to make her more palatable- Bull is better as the hard-boiled, cynical policeman ( - I thought you were the law and order here. - I'm aiming for order, mostly .) but he is too much a clone of Detective Miller from the first book, as if the authors were a bit lazy and recycled what they thougth was their best creation.On to the good stuff: - the plot is basically a thriller that combines well action scenes with political machinations, creating good opportunities for heroic behaviour and self-sacrifice and other scenes of intense emotional turmoil- the science part of the novel is a notch above what we have been offered previously, especially when it comes to the effects of gravity and inertia and relativistic speed applied to spaceship mobility. Also good efforts to combine weightlessness with air pressure and to use it in creative ways in combat.- the interaction between the members of the Rocinante crew remains a highlight of the series, probably not surprising since they are the only ones to feature in all the current three books.- interesting debate on the role of religion in the space age, well handled- very strong ending that opens up a host of wildly unpredictable potential developments for the next book in the series, one that would remain on my instant buy list."}, {"userName": "Scott  Hitchcock", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50894754-scott-hitchcock", "userReview": "Book 1: 5*Book 2: 4.5*Book 3: 4.25*Another good book in this series.

Now that I knew that there were at least four sequels and two more in plans, I could barely use my empathy switch to the full capacity, if you know what I mean. It all was too predictable.

It took me however a little while to get used to the new narrators. Once more, we have a new cast of main players, including Bull, Anna and Clarissa. The first two piqued my interest pretty quickly and I enjoyed finding out about their lives, how they ended up in the limelight and what part they were going to have in the plot. Clarissa however was a little harder to connect, but the authors still pulled it off nicely. In fact, they always seem to be able to give us new portrayals that are compelling and often complex. Even the secondary ones stay with you (special mention goes to the lovely Sam). The crew of the Rocinante is also back to the fore and Holden once more finds himself in the middle of it all. The protomolecule has left Venus and 'relocated' to the outer edge of our system in the shape of a ring. It is of course too tempting a conundrum, and all human factions send ships to find out what it is. Politics and manipulations still abound but this time we also have the world of religion joining the fray, and the machiavellian plans of one person bent on revenge.With all the potential dangers around, it is not surprising that ultimately it is humans that are still the greatest threat, especially those with disillusions of grandeur or of beliefs.

It was possible she was hurling her prayers at a cold and unfeeling universe that didn\u2019t hear them, but that wasn\u2019t how it felt. Science had given mankind many gifts, and she valued it. But the one important thing it had taken away was the value of subjective, personal experience. That had been replaced with the idea that only measurable and testable concepts had value.

Learn to open and close the door, it\u2019s a place to hide things. Never grasping what it actually did, and maybe not even having the framework necessary to figure it out. No monkey ever reheated a frozen burrito.\u201d...\"\nWhile all thinking creatures in the Solar System were pondering the meaning of something else thinking in the universe, one young woman has only one thought on her mind - vengeance!!! Vengeance against Captain James Holden and the crew who put her father in prison for ever and ruined her family and position in life. For a while now she has put all of her efforts into creating a whole new persona just so she can pull the worst type of vengeance on this famous and almost revered paragon of virtue. Killing him would not be enough, killing him and his image just might do to satisfy her! The danger to others and the risk she puts many people in is not a deterrent. \n\"...\u201cThere are no souls, Melba thought with a touch of pity. We are bags of meat with a little electricity running through them. No ghosts, no spirits, no souls. The only thing that survives is the story people tell about you.\u201d...\"\nHolden is still Holden and he is one very lucky man, because he has an awesome crew to keep his \"act-before-you-think\" compulsive behaviors somewhat in check. I really think that 90% of the crew problems would disappear if they would all just listen to Naomi!!! She is smart and thinks things through, also she is a woman, so yeah, listen to her, you dumb-assess!!! Holden's earnestness and misguided naivete get on my nerves, but the story was very good despite that:) However, there were some hard chapters to read, not because they were bad, but because they were a graphic representation of what violence and the human habit to shoot first can bring on peoples' lives... \n\"...\u201cViolence is what people do when they run out of good ideas. It's attractive because it's simple, it's direct, it's almost always available as an option. When you can't think of a good rebuttal for your opponent's argument, you can always punch them in the face.\u201d...\"\nThis was an engaging and exciting Science Fiction, a bit light on the science, which is not a bad thing for those who dislike getting bogged-down into the technical and scientific details of older examples of the genre. I would recommend it to all the fans of the genre and even those who are just getting interested in it. Now I wish you all Happy Reading and may you always find what you Need in the pages of a Good Book!!!"}, {"userName": "Hacen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5056329-hacen", "userReview": "Actual Rating: 4.25"}, {"userName": "Kaitlin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin", "userReview": "This series seems to be a series I am really into and it's Sci-fi, which is awesome! I definitely find that I struggle more to find Sci-fi that I can connect with and get interested in, but this series blends the big epic adventure with the nitty gritty of war, people, mistakes and more. I love the fact that this is one of the most diverse series in terms of representation and grey (not just good/bad) characters, and the plots are always fun and crazy too.This particular book follows Melba and Holden and their cosmic showdown ;) Melba is a character who is deeply flawed and filled with anger, rage and betrayal. Not only is she genetically enhanced, she's also wily, cunning and rich which all spells trouble for Holden and his crew.Honestly, I really enjoyed this and it was kind of similar to the others in the series for me as it starts off quite slow but it just builds and builds until you're super into the story and there is action left, right and centre. I definitely liked the way the plot threads all came together and seeing the very real human conflicts pitted against the backdrop of a very scary alien zone was super cool.I'm sure this series has much more in store and it seems like we'll be seeing way more of some of these characters and some of the universe so I can't wait. Definitely looking forward to continuing - 4*s from me :)"}, {"userName": "Janet", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7889174-janet", "userReview": "Arg this book is frustrating. I enjoyed Leviathan Wakes, and was excited to see how the world developed. Caliban's War I thought really delivered on that promise, introducing characters far more interesting then the first book and expanding the world. This book...not so much.There are two glaring issues with this book. The first is Melba. I can't think of another word other than obvious. From the moment she is introduced, it's both incoherent with what was established in the last two books, and it's pretty clear where this story line is heading. The next character being introduced is a pastor? Yeah. So pretty much everything around that was a bummer. The second issue is not really using the proteomolecule. The last book ended with such a great cliffhanger, that I felt had no payoff but to further the plot. You have an awesome alien particle that makes giant rings out of planets and floats them across the galaxy? This book didn't live up to that sort of awesomeness. It's still a fun fast paced novel, and I'm glad to have spent another book with Holden and his crew. I just wished the rest of the book surrounding them had been better."}, {"userName": "Sanaa", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5944522-sanaa", "userReview": "[4 Stars] This one wasn't quite as good as the first in the series. I think the ending really picked up, but the beginning was fairly meh. It's also strange because this book has a large scope, but everything takes place in fairly close quarters. It gave a different kind of feel to the book than the other two, not bad, but it made me feel less connected to the characters, particularly Melba. I really loved Anna and Bull, but I feel like Bull's story was just left hanging if you know what I mean. I also felt like Bull was almost a not-crazy-Miller if you know what I mean. I wanted more. Anna, Anna though. I loved her because she was so different and compassionate and yeah she was great. I also felt that the whole proto-molecule stuff flew over my head initially, and only later in the book did I really get it. May be I was reading too fast. Still, this book is really good and an excellent addition to the series. I like the way this book wrapped things up while still leaving room for so much more."}, {"userName": "Milo (BOK)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6106947-milo-bok", "userReview": "The Full Review: http://thefoundingfields.com/2013/06/....\n\u201cThere are some series that I wish could go on forever, and The Expanse is one that fulfils that category. James SA Corey delivers another stunning entry with Abaddon\u2019s Gate, and therefore Book Four cannot come fast enough.\u201d\n ~The Founding FieldsJames SA Corey is the penname of Daniel Abraham & Ty Frank, for those people who do not already know \u2013 if you\u2019ve been following the series or at least have read the first volume, then you\u2019ll know this by now. Daniel Abraham it seems can turn everything he touches into awesomeness \u2013 I\u2019ve really enjoyed his The Dagger and the Coin epic fantasy series, whilst his urban fantasy Unclean Spirits under the penname of MLN Hanover has made me want to read more of that series, although I have not picked it up in a while, which is something that I really need to get around to.\"For generations, the solar system \u2013 Mars, the Moon, the Asteroid Belt \u2013 was humanity\u2019s great frontier. Until now. The alien artefact working through its program under the clouds of Venus has emerged to build a massive structure outside the orbit of Uranus: a gate that leads into a starless dark.Jim Holden and the crew of the Rocinante are part of a vast flotilla of scientific and military ships going out to examine the artefact. But behind the scenes, a complex plot is unfolding, with the destruction of Holden at its core. As the emissaries of the human race try to find whether the gate is an opportunity or a threat, the greatest danger is the one they brought with them.\"We\u2019re back with the crew of the Rocinante, and it\u2019s very interesting to see how the main cast develop over this instalment, with Jim Holden, Naomi and Amos being the main crew memebers, but there\u2019s also strong showing from other returning characters too. Newcomers, such as Bull, Melba and Anna, also present an interesting, fresh look in the series, and we\u2019re starting to understand for the first time for why this series is called The Expanse. It\u2019s big. There are several characters alongside those already mentioned and the book rarely stays from the POV of most characters for long, which can be jarring for readers who favour one character over the other, but Corey has managed to make each viewpoint enjoyable and there wasn\u2019t a dull one. Another point in favour of the Expanse goes to the Space Opera setting itself, it allows the reader to explore a wide variety of concepts and setting so that we never feel like Abaddon\u2019s Gate is simply just a re-hash of Leviathan Wakes and Caliban\u2019s War, with Corey coming up with new ideas to bring to the table.Middle novels in series can be sometimes of a chore to get through. All too often, they are spent setting up the final act, continuing on from the first, and not much really happens. Not so with Abaddon\u2019s Gate, it\u2019s page-turning action all the way through \u2013 and even this novel brings a certain sense of conclusion to the book, as the series was originally planned as a trilogy before being extended. I haven\u2019t been finishing novels as quickly as I would like to lately, mainly due to exams (which are now out of the way), but Abaddon\u2019s Gate was one novel that I have been waiting for since Caliban\u2019s War and exam the next day or not, I could not resist staying up slightly later than normal to get as much reading done. So, if I did fail my exam \u2013 I blame James SA Corey for crafting such an impressive and mind-blowingly awesome novel.Seriously. This series has to be among the best of the Space Opera at the moment, up there with the likes of Iain M. Banks & Alastair Reynolds. Corey\u2019s novels keep getting better and better. Whilst I\u2019m no expert in politics, everything seems pretty realistic here, with humanity not being presented as a unified force, which is the problem that I have with such things in other media, Independence Day and Halo being two notable examples, it seems as though we\u2019re never going to put aside our differences at any point. Not even for a big massive alien invasion.Another thing that I love about this series is the lack of Hyperspace Travel/Warp Drives etc. This is a series not set 40,000 years into the future like the novels of Black Library, and it\u2019s a little closer to home. Technology is still developing, and there isn\u2019t a massive influx of alien races in Star Wars. Fans will be pleased to know that there\u2019s no change here, and Corey continues so that Abaddon\u2019s Gate is still recognisably part of the same series, although it probably isn\u2019t the best jumping on point for newcomers \u2013 you\u2019re better off just playing catchup. Whilst it may not be the cheapest option, it\u2019ll certainly be the most rewarding one.Fans of the series will not need any convincing to buy this book \u2013 but I\u2019m going to give this book my strongest recommendation anyway, as it currently stands a contender for one of the best novels of 2013 so far. Count me on board for Book #4 for certain.VERDICT: 5/5"}, {"userName": "Mr. Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15984059-mr-matt", "userReview": "The mystery of the protomolecule seems to be finally unraveled at the end of book two. The alien artifact hi-jacked Venus to build a massive ring out beyond Uranus; however, questions remain. What is the purpose of the gate? What does it do? Earth, Mars and the OPA send what remains of their navies along with premier scientists, spiritual leaders and even artists to investigate. With Holden there too trouble starts almost immediately.Clarissa Mao, the daughter of Jules-Pierre Mao and the owner of the now defunct Mao-Kwikowski Mercantile, has a new identity. She has a new identity and manages to get an assignment on one of the star ships heading out to the ring. There, she arranges an intricately complex plot to frame Holden. She wants her revenge. She wants Holden to be discredited and ruined, just like he did to her father. When the plot comes to a head, Holden is forced to flee through the ring and out of the solar system. Determined to bring him to justice, first the OPA and then Earth and Mars follow him. In the gate, Clarissa Mao is still working towards her final revenge. She sneaks on board Holden's ship in an effort to blow it up. And, to make matters worse, there is a mutiny and counter mutiny on the OPA's massive ship, the Behemoth. The once and future captain of the Behemoth, freed from his captivity, is set on a plan to save all of humanity by destroying the gate itself. Inside the gate, the humans find themselves trapped by an odd field that negates the laws of physics as we know them. As the tension mounts between the OPA, the Mars, and the Earth, the oddities get increasingly restrictive. Ships find themselves unable to move. Although no one except for Holden seems to notice, the ring itself appears to be acting to minimize threats. And each perceived threat is met by harsher measures. What will happen if the humans do something drastic - like firing a giant laser into the ring?Clearly, there is a lot going on in this book. Almost too much. It is almost a Rube Goldberg machine of a plot. Clarissa, a young woman in her twenties, builds and executes an amazingly complex plan to destroy Holden. Worse, when it all comes apart, after all the lives that she has cost, she finds herself forgiven by the very people that she set out to destroy. It all comes full circle when the story in some ways becomes a morality tale: the redemption of Clarissa Mao. It's all just a bit much. Awesome, but overly complex.Four and a half stars rounded down to four. Close to going up to five, but I just couldn't do it.

This book introduces a new concept that has the potential to change the whole series and I'm sure this aspect will be explored more in the next installments, the story was as good as you can expect from any of the books in these series , but the introduction of new characthers and explaiin the new concept mentioned above felt like it took a little bit of excitement off the story.

A live feed from the Y Que broadcasts the events.The Roci crew has had a propsperous year; they've made a bunch of ship upgrades including joining Naomi and Holden's rooms and and adding a rail gun. Detective Miller continues to visit Holden, but he doesn't seem to actually hear Holden or talk directly to him--he mostly seems to speak gibberish. He asks Holden for help and says \"they know I find things. They know you help me.\" Naomi knows about it, but Holden hasn't told the others.There's a food shortage for the outer planets/belt, since Ganymede now produces less than 1/4 of its previous food output. Venus is completely dead. Inside the Ring is some sort of anomaly. Bull (Carlos c de Baca) is a former Earth marine, now OPA and XO on the Behemoth, the largest weapons ship in the solar system--formerly the Nauvoo, but commandeered by Fred Johnson during the Eros incident. The Behemoth is a \"retrofitted piece of crap\" that wouldn't hold up in a real fight; it's mainly for show. Just before launch, Bull is re-assigned to chief security officer; Captain Ashford doesn't want a former Earther as 2nd in command of the OPA's flagship. Bull doesn't care for Ashford much.Clarissa Mao--daughter of Jules-Pierre Mao--gets a new identity as Melba Koh and will soon be shipping out on the Cerisier, a civilian maintenance ship going to the Ring. The guy selling her her new identity tries to shake her down and she kills him and his goons; she has implanted glands in her mouth that release chemicals that basically turn her into a ninja--though she crashes majorly afterwards. She plans to humiliate James Holden for destroying her family, then kill him.Europa Pastor Annushka Volovodov has been chosen for the secretary-general's advisory group for the civilian trip to the Ring. She boards the UNN Thomas Prince, a Xerxes-class battleship.If the Nauvoo fires its railgun, the ship will tear apart. Many of its parts were built to spin, since the ship would only have thrust gravity at the start and end of its journey. Bull can't get the budget from the XO, Michio Pa, to fix many of the problems. Samara Rosenberg from Tycho is the chief engineer.Holden takes a job as far away from the Ring as possible, but the employer backs out at the last minute when Holden is served a summons from Mars; they want the Roci back, and it's impounded at Ceres. Monica Stuart from UN Public Broadcasting wants to do a story on the Ring, and asks Holden to take her and her team there; under the Freedom of Journalism Act, she has reasonable use of any hired materials and personnel. Holden believes Miller might be behind all of this.Melba commands a team of 4 technicians on the Cerisier, but she's doing a poor job of faking it. She leaves a bomb on a ship called the Seung Un; she creates a video of Holden saying he's claiming control of the Ring on behalf of the OPA, and has paid someone on Ceres to setup a remote connection on the Roci. She confides in Ren, a member of her team, that she's in over her head with the engineering job, and he says he'll help her out.Behemoth staff have been showing up to work high. Bull (with his deputy Serge), bust a drug dealer and Bull non-chalantly puts him out an airlock. Ashford relieves him of duty, but Bull explains that on a military vessel anyone endangering the ship is to be executed. Ashford waffles and tells him never to do it again. The XO recognizes that Bull did this to show the crew he's more Belter than the captain, and he just made her shit list.Miller keeps telling Holden to check his doors and corners and to clear the room or he's going to wind up dead; Holden's not so sure he's just speaking gibberish any more. Data shows that the Y Que is still moving in a straight line at a constant speed of 600 meters/second.Ren confronts Melba after he gets air filter data from the Seung Un indicating there might be a bomb aboard; she turns into a ninja, breaks his neck, then seals his corpse up in a storage locker in her room.Anna starts holding prayer meetings on the Prince, as many of the crew are distraught about the Ring. She sees a young woman that looks like she needs help; it's Melba, and she's going crazy with remorse after killing Ren. She thinks Anna somehow knows what she did, and tweaks out at her.Melba heads back to the Cerisier and activates the software on the Roci, issuing a trigger code to blow up Seung Un, announcing Holden's responsibility and demands, then powering up weapons and targeting systems.On the Behemoth, probes sent into the Ring have determined there are a number of large objects, possibly ships, on the other side. XO Pa revokes Sam's access privileges for making repairs Bull told her to do; Pa knows this, but is politicking to turn Bull's allies against him.Bull gets the transmission from Holden demanding that the information and resources about the Ring remain free to all people and that he'll kill anyone who tries to stop him. Bull and Pa tell Ashford to shoot down the Roci so Earth doesn't think the OPA is on his side; Ashford reluctantly fires a torpedo, but this causes the whole ship to lose power. The XO lets Sam out of confinement to fix the ship.Holden realizes the lawsuit and the camera crew were a setup for this moment. The Behemoth fires a torpedo at them, but Naomi's countermeasures are all offline. With no other options, they take the Roci into the Ring.Ashford wants to follow the Roci through Ring; Mars vows to destroy them if they even get close to the Ring. Bull suggests to Pa that they overthrow the captain, but she insists they follow the chain of command.Hector \"Hank\" Cortez (spiritual advisor to the UN secretary-general) asks Anna to sign a petition to take the Prince into the Ring; she immediately agrees, seeing it as a way to reunite the fleets and stave off war.Melba is extremely upset that Holden survived her sabotage. When the Cersisier's employers order a number of crew to be dispatched to the Prince to chase after Holden, she volunteers. Before leaving, she removes Ren from her storage locker and stores him in her toolchest. On the Prince, she recognizes Anna's friend Tilly, who used to babysit her.The inside of the Ring is 1 milliom km across, bounded by 1373 rings spaced into a sphere. The only open ring is the one to Earth. In the center is the \"Ring Station\", a metal sphere 5km across; orbitting it are the Y Que and the probes that have been sent through. In the \"Slow Zone\", nothing can go faster than 600 m/s.Amos is replacing a lightbulb in the head when he finds the transmitter that was hacking their system. One of the documentary crew, a blind guy, admits that he got paid to stick it there. His glasses have a sonar optic system that he uses to create a 3D model of the woman who paid him; Holden thinks it's Julie Mao.Naomi puts out a broadcast saying the previous message was a fake; the other ships demand to see Holden, but he's EVA en route to the sphere. Bull tells Naomi that Ashford wants to send in an attack squad, and that he'll take the civilians off her hands.The sphere irises open and lets Holden enter. Inside, Miller explains that he's not actually there in person; he's the \"machine for finding lost things\" and can interface with the sphere's systems.Martian marines in exosuits catch up with Holden. An insect-like alien defense robot attempts to stop them, but they destroy it with a grenade; this teaches the station that even things moving as fast as a baseball pitch are dangerous, and the Slow Zone slows down even more, causing massive casualties on all the ships. More alien things activate and begin ripping the marines to pieces; they fall back.Melba uses the deceleration catastrophe to steal a mech suit and EVA to the Roci. She breaks in through the cargo door and attacks Naomi in engineering. Namoi's shoulder is crushed by the mech, and just as Melba is about to break her neck, Anna tazes her. Anna had recognized Melba in Naomi's broadcast as the girl who freaked out at her and pieced things together when Tilly told her that the image was of Claire Mao. Anna, high on amphetimines (she was injured during decceleration), stole a tazer and an EVA suit and followed Melba. Melba starts to recover, so Naomi and Anna flee; Melba keeps ripping all the doors open with her mech suit. Naomi passes out from blood loss; Anna grabs her and they hide in a locker. Melba begins tearing the locker doors off, but her mech's battery runs out. She uses her glands and starts kicking and ripping the locker door off with her bare hands, but the effects wear off before she can get to them. Anna sedates her and tapes her to a chair.Holden asks Miller to tell the station to help the people on the ships; Miller says it's utilitarian and can't do anything like that. Miller takes him to the central core; he needs Holden to phyiscally touch the interface in order to authorize Miller for remote access to it, since Miller himself is actually just the protomolecule running \"the most complex simulation in the history of [the] solar system\" inside Holden's brain to make it seem like he's there with him (he is nothing more than a \"fancy kind of hand terminal to the creators\").When Holden touches the core, his consciousness ascends and he learns about the creators, who were a galaxy-spanning hive consciousness; he can sense entire solar systems with his mind. He realizes the creators were sending fire through the Rings and blowing up entire star systems to try and quarantine something from coming through. The station has been waiting 2 billion years for the all-clear to open the network back up. Miller says the station is in \"war mode\" but he can take off the lockdown if--then the Martians show up and take Holden away.Bull awakes in the medical bay, paralyzed from the waste down. The doctor insists on putting him in a medical coma, but Bull has too much work to do; the injured people on all the ships won't heal properly in zero-g, so he wants to spin up the Behemoth's drum to create gravity. Sam has to remove the railgun and torpedo tubes first, and when Ashford finds out Bull has orchestrated this, he goes crazy with rage and orders Bull into the coma. Pa and Bull relieve him of duty, making Pa the captain. Bull contacts the Roci and Anna tells him she thinks Melba blew up the Seung Un, and that they need help.Holden is taken to the MCRN Hammurabi where he explains everything that has happened so far. He's put in a holding cell; Miller appears and tells him they all need to shut down their ship's power so he can unspring the lockdown. This will probably open up all the Rings, which could be very bad--but Miller needs to know what happened.Melba is locked up on the Behemoth; she's near catatonic. Ashford is in a cell beside her and promises her amnesty if she helps get him out; she ignores him. She won't respond to Bull, so he sends in Tilly; she confesses that she did it all because Holden \"hurt daddy.\"Anna and the Roci crew are taken to the Behemoth. Tilly asks Anna to speak with Claire; she again confesses everything, but Anna wants to redeem her. Claire says there's no justice in that and doesn't want forgiveness for the terrible things she's done.Bull gets a call from Captain Jakande on the Hammurabi; she won't come to the Behemoth or give up Holden, because the MCRN won't let her surrender. Sam gifts Bull a modified mech suit that lets him walk; he's deeply touched. Bull asks her to turn the comm laser into a weapon so he can give the Martians a reason to surrender; they surrender willingly, and Holden is en route.When Holden arrives, he tells Pa everything, including how to shut off the protomolecule's hold on them. He heads to the medical bay to check on his crew and he's accosted by Anna. She tells him about Claire, then takes him to see his crew, who are all grateful to her for saving their lives. Anna asks them to forgive Clarissa, and Holden reluctantly agrees when Naomi says she forgives her.Clarissa's conscience has returned and she's taken to hating herself instead of Holden. She eavesdrops on Ashford's visitors and realizes they're planning a coup. Hector Cortez (who used to golf with her dad) asks her to join the coup; he feels responsible for many of the deaths, since he was the one who petitioned to come into the Ring. He's joined with Ashford so they can use the comm laser to destroy the gate--locking themselves inside--in order to stop others from following them. He wants Claire to use her abilities to keep Ashford alive. Deciding that all the deaths will be given meaning this way, she agrees.Bull gets a call from Serge warning that Ashford's people are taking over. Bull warns Pa, then calls Sam; she tells him Ashford's guys took engineering and asked her to overclock the laser, so they can destroy the Ring. She tells him to hole up in one of the storage lockers and he does. Serge is killed in a skirmish with Ashford's soldiers.Cortez asks Anna for her help controlling the mob after they close the Ring; she disagrees that that is the solution, and refuses to join him.The Roci crew realizes something is going down; Naomi calls Sam, who tells them to hide and that she'll join them shortly. En route they beat up a couple of insurgents and take their weapons. They rendezvous with Sam and she fills them in, explaining that using the laser will melt that entire side of the ship; Holden tells her that if they attack, the Ring Station might destroy their entire solar system. Sam sends them to find Bull while she sabotages the laser. Bull rounds up his people and they set up base in the admin offices where Radio Free Slow Zone has been broadcasting from. Bull has the journalist Monica and preacher Anna do a broadcast explaining the situation and asking everyone to shut down their reactors so the station will let the ships go.Sam continues to sabotage the laser; Ashford calls her to the bridge and when another egineer disagrees with how long the repairs should take, he shoots Sam. With Sam dead, Naomi is tasked with shutting down the reactor and gassing the bridge; Holden will take the bridge once they're all unconscious; Amos will stay and guard Anna; and Alex will head back to the Roci to secure it.Bull's team retakes engineering. Naomi tries to gas the bridge, but Clarissa disables remote access to it. Ashford sends out a team of 4 soldiers equipped with confiscated Martian power armor. He shut downs the rotating drum section of the Behemoth--leading to another catastrophic inertia change and injuring even more people--and sends the armored soldiers straight through to engineering.Bull, Naomi, et. al. are forced to retreat from engineering when the 4 power-suited soldiers arrive. Naomi managed to dump the core, but not the grid--so Ashfrod can still fire the laser. They escape out an airlock and into an elevator shaft in vacuum. Bull stays behind to cover them; he throws his 2 remaining grenades at the pursuing mech warriors, killing 2 of them and sacrificing himself.In the offices, Amos manages to repell the attack, but his team suffers massive casualties. Anna broadcasts that they're losing the fight and that they need to stop Ashford or Earth will be destroyed. Clarissa calls and says she could open the bridge doors for Holden, but wants Anna to convince her; Anna says to have faith in the people who chose to forgive her in spite of the pain she's caused them, and to stop siding with Ashford, who kills innocents out of convenience. Clarissa opens the doors.Naomi rigs the backup elevator to engage, squashing the 2 remaining marines in mech armor like bugs. The hatch opens (thanks to Claire) and fire is exchanged from both sides. Ashford tries to shoot Claire, but she dropkicks him, then re-rigs the bridge access controls, allowing the grid to be taken offline. The ship shuts down and the lights go out.Holden suddenly finds himself on an alien planet with proto-Miller. With all the ships powered down, Miller managed to shut down the station's defenses, which freed the ships and opened all the Rings. No malevolent force appears and kills them, but Miller warns him that they could still be out there. Even though his creators are gone, Miller can't stop searching for them and tells Holden he \"needs a ride.\"Anna insists that Clarissa gets a fair trial on Luna, and asks Holden to transport her there. When he refuses, she offers to buy the Roci from Mars and give it to him if he'll agree; she calls up Tilly and asks her to foot the bill, and she will. Aboard the Roci, Claire helps Amos fix all the damage she caused, and finds she really enjoys the crew's company.Review: 4.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Brandon", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3214163-brandon", "userReview": "When we last left things, whatever the Protomolecule had been doing on Venus following Eros Station\u2019s crash landing appears to have come to an end. The bad news? Well, it sort of constructed this giant mysterious mechanical ring that drifted off into space and made its way into Uranus\u2019 (heh heh) orbit. No one knows what it is, or what its intentions are, so several ships from Mars, Earth and the OPA (Outer Planets Alliance) have decided to park their ships in front of it and just sort of.. wait for something to happen.As with Caliban\u2019s War, new characters are again introduced into Corey\u2019s ever-expanding universe. We\u2019re introduced to a few newbies on their journeys to The Ring: Bull, an Earther from New Mexico working as head of security on an OPA ship; Anna, a Russian born pastor riding on a ship full of religious dignitaries; and Melba, a mysterious woman harbouring a grudge against Captain James Holden.And speaking of Holden, Mars has begun proceedings to reacquire their property, the former Martian warship now dubbed The Roci. In an effort to escape the Martian Navy, Holden has agreed to transport a documentary news crew to the front lines of The Ring, despite Holden\u2019s reservations - he believes the Protomolecule isn't finished with him yet and worries that by getting too close, he\u2019ll endanger not only himself, but his crew.Abaddon\u2019s Gate is definitely the grittiest, messiest entry in The Expanse series up to this point. The bulk of the action takes place within one ship, a small space compared to the galaxy-spanning action of the first two novels. Close quarters combat causes buckets of blood to spill along with several jaw-dropping developments that kept me on the edge of my seat.When I normally approach long running series, I like to spread out the material to prolong the length of time I spend with the books. However with The Expanse, I can\u2019t pick up the next book fast enough.

I wanted something with huge scope, and while I kept thinking about Iain M. Banks Culture or more to the point, Brin's Uplift War, or even Pohl's Gateway series, I was thoroughly impressed with the Expanse because it kept me grounded in the multiple scales needed to fully appreciate it. Sure, there's series that have galaxy-wide adventure, but how does one truly draw the reader into a true appreciation of it? Answer: have an extremely fully-fleshed solar system and the need for an equation between time and distance. Keep all of the action in that localized space but throw the implications of something so vast and horrible into the mix that it makes everyone feel like ants. These guys have that little literary monster on a leash and they like to let him snap at pedestrians. I love it.The characters are all spectacular and engrossing. I'm not just talking about the standard crew, either, but even the many who fight, love, and die in this fantastic story. The quality of story and writing is amazing.I will be following this series forever, I do believe. :)"}, {"userName": "Justine", "userReviewDate": "Sep 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18656418-justine", "userReview": "Another solid addition to the series.

That's not to say the novel isn't good but it has some flaws which made me think this series might be running out of steam. I hope I'm going to be proven wrong but the only way I can do that is to pick up the next volume.The premise of the novels is humanity has explored the solar system and colonized both Mars as well as the Asteroid Belt. Unfortunately, this hasn't come with prosperity for all mankind. Poverty and conflict remain with humanity as the need for resources has become greater than ever. The conflict between the three factions has been made worse by the existence of the protomolecule, a billion-year-old alien artifact that has opened up new areas of technology as well as science. One of these is a massive celestial gate on the other end of the solar system.A group of priests, priestesses, reverends, and other religious leaders have been assembled on a publicity mission to investigate it. Meanwhile, Clarissa Mao, daughter of Jules-Pierre Mao, plots to frame Captain Holden and the crew of the Rocinate in order to avenge her father. This frame-up job ends up forcing Holden and the crew through the gate to become the first people to see what lies across the universe.The mystery of Abaddon's Gate is an interesting one as we get to see hints of what species created the protomolecule and why. The continued lack of actual aliens in the series is something which is both to its benefit and deterrent. It's really a series about humanity's reactions to alien life versus alien life itself. I don't know if we'll ever solve the mystery of what happened to them but it seems very likely we will and I'm not sure that's a great direction for the series to go. Then again, I compare it to A Song of Ice and Fire. I'm much more interested in the events in King's Landing versus the White Walkers.An interesting element is the novel it is a surprisingly religious novel. The character of Anna is a devoted Eastern Orthodox priest (or so I believe--things can change a lot in Russia in 200 years) who wants to save the soul of Clarissa Mao as well as end the fighting without further bloodshed. She spends a lot of time contemplating God, the universe, destiny, and alien life which is not the sort of thing you usually find in hard science fiction novels.The crew of the Rocinante are decent in this book but nothing really interesting happens with them. Yes, Holden is framed but no one believes it for very long nor is there much tension from the crew. We also lack interactions with Bobbie Draper, which is a shame as I really liked her character. I will say that Holden is starting to grate on me as a character since his naked idealism only works with very cynical characters to contrast him to.I also have to give the author's props for the fact they created the Behemoth--a converted Mormon generation ship which the OPA has turned into a completely useless military vessel. It can't fire any of its weapons due to the fact it's not structurally built for combat but it looks like it is. I will say, though, the book's handling on drug dealing offended me. One of the supposedly heroic characters spaces a man for dealing them and lost all sympathy as a result from me.Indeed, my biggest issue with the book is the character of Bacca. One of the major plots of the book is how he has to seize power from his insane military commander who is grossly underqualified for his position. When, in fact, I think Bacca is a dangerously unstable murderer who mounts a mutiny for flimsy pretexts. When you actively hate one of the main characters and think he should fail, something has gone wrong.In conclusion, Abaddon's Gate was....okay. I hope the next book is better, though.6/10"}, {"userName": "aPriL does feral sometimes ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3409532-april-does-feral-sometimes", "userReview": "The Hebrew term Abaddon (Hebrew: \u05d0\u05b2\u05d1\u05b7\u05d3\u05bc\u05d5\u05b9\u05df\u200e, '\u01cd\u1e07add\u014dn), and its Greek equivalent Apollyon (Greek: \u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd, Apollyon), appear in the Bible as a place of destruction and an angel, respectively. In the Hebrew Bible, abaddon is used with reference to a dwelling place of the dead, often appearing alongside the better-known term \u05e9\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc (sheol). In the New Testament Book of Revelation, an angel called Abaddon is shown as the king of an army of locusts; his name is first transcribed in Greek (Revelation 9:11 \u2014 \"whose name in Hebrew Abaddon\" (\u1f08\u03b2\u03b1\u03b4\u03b4\u1f7c\u03bd)), and then translated (\"which in Greek means the Destroyer\" (\u1f08\u03c0\u03bf\u03bb\u03bb\u03cd\u03c9\u03bd, Apollyon)). The Latin Vulgate, as well as the Douay Rheims Bible, has an additional note (not present in the Greek text), \"in Latin Exterminans\", exterminans being the Latin word for \"destroyer\".-WikipediaWhoa. Is that a portend of something BIG for this book, or what?In my mind there are two candidates for Abaddon: James Holden and Miller. On that enigmatic note, I'll leave this particular thought.ALERT: If you haven't read the previous two books in the 'Expanse' series, stop reading this review at this point. My review is full of spoilers about the two previous books in the series (but not this one).: )In this third book of the Expanse series, the holy fool Holden is once again at the center of a political maelstrom. As usual, he's utterly clueless about why it has to be about him, but he's learned from Miller that he has to take preemptive action. The problem is Miller is dead, having died as a hero in the previous novel, yet he's showing up in a haze of pretty blue motes whenever Holden is going about his business. Oh dear.But it's not Holden who has won my heart in this exciting conclusion to the trilogy of 'Leviathon Wakes', 'Caliban's War' and 'Abaddon's Gate' (NOT, I think, precluding more novels about The Rocinante's crew). In the previous books it was Miller I adored - poor, doomed Miller. Given my instincts for falling for doomed characters, I almost hesitate to confess this time it's Carlos c de Baca, or Bull as he is known to his friends, who I worry and stress over from chapter to chapter. Since he's Chief Security Officer of the OPA's largest spaceship,  The Bohemoth,  on it's way to intercept the ships of Mars and Earth, which are on their way to explore the Ring, a thousand-kilometers wide structure built by an alien artifact outside the orbit of Uranus, linked to a deadly protomolecule with a propensity to change people to goo (nightmare scenarios thoroughly explored in the previous novels), his survivability is in doubt. If he finds himself hooked up with Holden, I don't believe he has a hope of living to the last page.But maybe the authors will let their pragmatic heroes live this time. The madmen are running things as usual: politicians, religious leaders, military. Is it any wonder things go to Hell - or as the author's call it, Abaddon's Gate? Will we finally learn who sent the protomolecule into our solar system? Will Mars, Earth and the Belters ever stop fighting? I hope not.This is a truly fun series, and my one misery since discovering it is I always need to finish the novels in one sitting.
