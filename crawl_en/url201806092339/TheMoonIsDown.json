It\u2019s generally viewed as objectionable, ugly, and immoral. Meet the honorable, dignified exception to that stereotype.John Steinbeck\u2019s 1942 novel, written to support the Allied effort during WWII, is propaganda as pure as freshly fallen snow, as righteous and moral as love for humanity. It is propaganda in affirmation of freedom, self-determination, and the indomitable will of people to persevere and overcome.PLOT SUMMARY:The story begins with a peaceful, democratic village swiftly invaded and occupied by aggressive, fascist army bearing all of the telltales of Nazi Germany. \u201cBy 10:45 it was all over. The town was occupied, the defenders defeated, and the war was finished.\u201d The brilliant irony of the novel\u2019s first words is revealed only later as we learn that \u201cthe war\u201d has barely even begun. We meet the simple, hardworking people of the village, who seem perplexed, but not, initially, embittered by the invaders. We meet the enemy, Colonel Lanser and his officers, none of whom are presented as \u201cmustache-twirling\u201d villains. Just soldiers doing a job. The initial interactions are cordial, almost bizarrely so, and there is a sense that things may not be so bad.Wrong..it is...and Steinbeck deftly, methodically commences to bleed the air of lightheartedness out of the narrative, and reveals the underlying severity of his message.This brings me to the first major kudo I wish to bestow on Steinbeck. His manipulation and control over his material is impressive, and he effectively confounds your expectations through the slowly escalating gravity of the story\u2019s tone. After the initial brutal invasion, including the killing of a group of the town\u2019s soldiers, is glossed over and depicted in a casual, almost humorous fashion, I was thinking that this may be something akin to a black comedy. Not the case, and Steinbeck begins to turn the screws. The invaders need the townspeople to work the coal mine (the town\u2019s coal resources were the reason it was targeted). The town people do not take kindly to being \u201cforced\u201d to work the mines. The invaders insist\u2026Tension\u2026animosity\u2026hatred\u2026violence ensue that I will leave for you to discover. THOUGHTS:The horror of war, the enduring strength of freedom, and the self-defeating process of using humans to impose \u201cinhuman\u201d oppression, these are the messages of Steinbeck's work. I want to talk a little about this latter aspect first, because it\u2019s something you don\u2019t see portrayed enough in stories about occupying forces. Usually, you see the damage that is inflicted on those that have been deprived of their liberty, and Steinbeck certainly does reflect this in the story. However, he also shows the dehumanizing, destructive effect of the occupation on the occupier. As the townspeople become resentful and openly antagonistic, it begins to take a devastating toll on the enemy soldiers, who simply want to go home to their own families and feel like they have been lied to by their superiors. They find they must constantly be on their guard and can never travel alone, which has a serious effect on their morale. \u201cFear crept in on the men in their billets and it made them sad and it crept into their patrols and it made them cruel.\u201d These soldiers, just like their captives, have lost their freedom, and Steinbeck\u2019s portrayal of their desolation powerfully closes the circle on the \u201cthere are truly no winners in a war of aggression\u201d theme. There are only victims. On the other side of the coin, Steinbeck extols the right of people to live free and inner resolve that comes from the yearning to self-determine. His message, delivered throughout the second half of the story, is that the very nature of invasion and occupation give rise to the invaders downfall by reorganizing the previously self-interested and peaceful townsfolk into a cohesive band of freedom fighters. \n Free men cannot start a war, but once it is started, they can fight on in defeat. Herd men, followers of a leader, cannot do that, and so it is always the herd men who win battles and the free men who win wars.\n The armies measures to try and maintain control over the populace backfire, as they must, and the extremes to which the oppressed will go to secure that which was taken only becomes more amplified. \u201cDon't you know you will have to kill all of us or we in time will kill all of you? You destroyed the law when you came in, and a new law took its place.\"Finally, I will begin my wrap up with one of my favorite quotes from the story, in which Steinbeck sums up his view on the futility of war. \nWar is treachery and hatred, the muddling of incompetent generals, the torture and killing and sickness and tiredness, until at last it is over and nothing has changed except for new weariness and new hatreds.\n Steinbeck\u2019s novel is a large story told on a very small stage. He doesn\u2019t mince around with nuances or delicate philosophies. He goes straight at the fundamentals. It will stay with you long after you reach the end. 4.5 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!"}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "Short and bitter sweet, The Moon is Down shows what becomes of docile countryfolk when they are invaded and subjugated.Not sure what to expect from this lesser known work by Steinbeck, my first impression after a few pages was that I was in for a light comedy, a sort of Catch-22 anti-war declaration, apparently with silly citizens and gullible army officers acting out a daffy pre-\"Hogan's Heroes\" farce. But then it turned serious and dark, and actually hopeful. There are small heroes, tiny victories. The struggle is not valiant. There are no action-packed depictions. It is furtive. Victory over their oppressors is implied. But the main point is that those supposedly conquered should struggle against their oppressors. Most will and most will never give up the fight. Aspects of The Moon is Down had a deja vu familiarity about them and then one particular scene jarred my memory and sent me back 30 years or more to a TV version of All Quiet on the Western Front. In it actor Richard Thomas (aka \"John Boy\") plays a German. I think in the early 80s he was trying to get away from his good-guy Waltons persona. Playing a soldier from an antagonistic army pushing himself on a woman from the conquered country would do it. Well anyway, the scene in question is not, to my recollection, from All Quiet..., but rather from this book. I hope Steinbeck got some credit."}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "John Steinbeck published The Moon is Down in 1942. While not directly naming either Norway or Germany, the reader understands that the setting is Norway during the Nazi German occupation, which began in 1940. Written for easy adaptation to the theater, Steinbeck evokes Ibsen with his play-like, scene-focused action. When the novel was published, Nazi German forces occupied much of Europe and North Africa and the Anglo-American and Russian allied forces had yet to check Nazi aggression and expansion. Steinbeck has created a simple, strident and moving declaration of the indomitable will of a people who refuse to give in to tyranny. The character Mayor Orden, a symbol of unassuming yet steadfast resistance and leadership, sums up the theme of the novel when he says: \u201cOur people are invaded, but I don\u2019t think they are conquered\u201d."}, {"userName": "Sawsan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11592808-sawsan", "userReview": "\u0641\u064a \u0645\u063a\u064a\u0628

Balzac, some classics, some indie titles, some surrealism - so when I reached for this unknown-to-me Steinbeck, I had no idea whether I was going to like it or not. But alas, it is Steinbeck. Despite being rather short, this book delivers much food for thought. Looking at the GR database, many readers have labeled this book as propaganda (apparently, it was written as such). Yet, I cannot label it the same way and maintain clean conscience. This little book is so much more than propaganda. In fact, it reminds me a little of my all-time favorite war story - Pins and Needles by Boris Vian. Why? Well, for starters, neither one is about a war. They both use war as a backdrop to a larger drama - the drama of human beings and their inability to coexist together in peace. They both center on the uselessness of war, on the idiocy of following out-of-touch leaders, of the blindness of following orders, and of the struggle to reconcile with the inutility of it all. Where Vian centered on a single soldier as a part of the machine, Steinbeck centers not on the machine itself, but rather on the players (the wheels) that make the machine turn. He focuses equally on the conquerors and the conquered, and their interactions. The details about the location are so minimal that the location itself becomes almost impertinent. And isn't that true in a real war, after all? Wars are not about places; they are about victories and losses. And as Steinbeck points out, the conquerors often win battles, but the conquered win wars, because they are not following a leader or an agenda. They are in it for themselves. Unlike the more contemporary books I read recently, The Moon is Down is written almost entirely as a dialogue between the various parties to the story. And here is where Steinbeck shines - in the dialogue, which advances the story without being boring, overdone, or cliched. We have friends talking, enemies talking, and through their exchanges we not only see the progress of the war itself, but also the progress of the change which is taking place inside the oppressed. This is a wonderful story about two men - one conquered and one conqueror. One elected and one appointed.

An excellent read."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4542979-kim", "userReview": "Well before the United States entered World War II, John Steinbeck became involved in several government intelligence and information agencies because he wanted to fight fascism. By September 1941 Steinbeck decided that he would write a work of fiction using what he had learned from European refugees about the psychological effects of occupation on people living in countries which had come under Nazi control. This novella is the result. Set in a village in an unnamed country, it focuses on the experiences of the locals as they deal with occupation by the armed forces of another unnamed country. The text makes it clear that the occupier is meant to be Germany, and while the occupied land could be a number of European countries, it is very much like Norway. The narrative describes the arrival of the enemy soldiers, the reaction of the villagers to occupation and of the soldiers to the act of occupying, the involvement of a local collaborator and the population's growing determination to resist the enemy and fight for freedom. Even though the work was specifically designed to be a piece of anti-Nazi propaganda, Steinbeck avoided stereotyping the invading soldiers. Instead, he showed them as human beings with differing attitudes to their role, missing home and their families and trying to justify their position to the locals. He was criticised for this. While many critics praised the work, some influential critics accused Steinbeck of being soft on the Nazis and suggested that the novella would demoralise victims of Nazi aggression in occupied Europe. Those particular critics were wrong. After the war, the King of Norway gave Steinbeck a medal in honour of the influence of the work in Norway and it later came to light that although the Nazis banned the book, it was translated, illegally printed and distributed throughout occupied western Europe. And not only in Europe: the book was also circulated in parts of China under Japanese occupation. If anything, by portraying the occupying soldiers as human beings and not as monsters, Steinbeck showed that they could be defeated.The work has the feeling of a parable, almost of a fairy tale. It is heavy on dialogue and relatively light on description. In common with many short works, the characters are lightly sketched in rather than well-developed. As befits a work of propaganda, it is somewhat didactic in tone. Overall, it's fair to say that in terms of literary merit, this is far from Steinbeck's best work. However, the simplicity of the writing had a purpose. As I was reading, it struck me that the work would have been relatively straightforward to translate. To translate a work of literature generally requires background-speaker level fluency in the original language and the language into which the work is to be translated. However, the language in this work is relatively simple and the complexities of metaphor and idiom are avoided. Anyone reasonably competent in English could have translated the work with the assistance of a good dictionary. That Steinbeck could adapt his writing style to such an extent, while still producing elegant prose, is a testament to his skill. Even though this is not Steinbeck's best work, it's still a thought-provoking read. It gets four stars for being a satisfying literary work and an additional star for being an interesting historical artifact."}, {"userName": "Melki", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5293536-melki", "userReview": "By 10:45 it was all over. The town was occupied, the defenders defeated, and the war was finished. Not quite. In Steinbeck's 1942 story of a small unnamed town invaded by an unnamed enemy, the war was far from finished. The book begins with an almost farcical tone - the mayor needs to have his ear hairs trimmed before his meeting with the conquering colonel, the ratfink mole who's been informing on the townsfolk seems surprised that he should not continue to live amongst them, and one of the soldiers is bitten by the mayor's feisty cook. Because of the ease the invading army had in taking the town, the officers assume that the local citizens will fall into line and accept them as their new rulers. The mayor predicts that things will not be that easy. \"The people are confused now. They have lived at peace so long that they do not quite believe in war. They will learn and then they will not be confused anymore.\"Things turn ugly after an incident at the local mine, and the mayor's prediction comes true as the oppressed people begin to exact their revenge. Steinbeck presents a unique look at life during wartime, and humankind's desire to be free."}, {"userName": "Mohammed  Ali", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/48402276-mohammed-ali", "userReview": "\" \u0644\u0642\u062f \u0623\u062a\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0646\u0648\u062f \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0634\u062a\u0627\u0621 \u0642\u0628\u0644 \u0645\u0648\u0639\u062f\u0647 , \u0637\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0642\u0627\u0644 \u0623\u0628\u064a \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u062a\u062c\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0626\u0629 , \u0623\u0648 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062c\u0648\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062f\u064a\u0626\u0629 \u062a\u062c\u0644\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628...\u0644\u0645 \u0623\u0639\u062f \u0623\u0630\u0643\u0631 \u0645\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u064a\u0642\u0648\u0644 \u0644\u0642\u0627\u0621 \u0645\u0639 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0627\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0645\u0631\u064a\u0643\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0647\u0648\u0631 \u062c\u0648\u0646 \u0634\u062a\u0627\u064a\u0646\u0628\u0627\u0643 \u0648 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0635\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0641\u064a \u0645\u063a\u064a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0645\u0631 , \u062d\u064a\u062b \u064a\u0633\u0644\u0637 \u0627\u0644\u0636\u0648\u0621 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0632\u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u062d\u062a\u0644\u0627\u0644 \u0648 \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0632\u0627\u0648\u064a\u0629 \u0645\u062e\u062a\u0644\u0641\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u0639\u0627 \u0645\u0627...\u0628\u0639\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u062a\u0627\u0644 \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0628\u0647\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u062e\u0646\u0629 .\" \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0639\u0628 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062d\u0628 \u0623\u0646 \u064a\u063a\u0632\u0649 \u064a\u0627 \u0633\u064a\u062f\u064a , \u0648 \u0647\u0643\u0630\u0627 \u0644\u0646 \u064a\u0628\u0642\u064a \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u063a\u0627\u0632\u064a , \u0625\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0644 \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0628\u062f\u0624\u0648\u0646 \u062d\u0631\u0628\u0627 , \u0648 \u0644\u0643\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u062d\u064a\u0646 \u062a\u0628\u062f\u0623 \u0633\u064a\u0648\u0627\u0635\u0644\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0647\u0627\u062f \u0648 \u0625\u0646 \u0623\u062d\u0627\u0637\u062a \u0628\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0647\u0632\u064a\u0645\u0629 . \u0625\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0639\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0633 \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a\u0646 \u064a\u062a\u0628\u0639\u0648\u0646 \u0632\u0639\u064a\u0645\u0627 , \u0644\u0627 \u064a\u0642\u062f\u0631\u0648\u0646 \u0639\u0644\u0649 \u0647\u0630\u0627 , \u0648 \u0647\u0643\u0630\u0627 \u062a\u062c\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0637\u0639\u0627\u0646 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u064a \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u062a\u0643\u0633\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0639\u0631\u0643\u0629 , \u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062d\u0631\u0627\u0631 \u062f\u0627\u0626\u0645\u0627 \u0647\u0645 \u0645\u0646 \u064a\u0643\u0633\u0628\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0631\u0628, \u0633\u062a\u062a\u0628\u064a\u0646 \u0623\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0647\u064a \u0645\u0627 \u0623\u0642\u0648\u0644\u0647 \""}, {"userName": "James", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41609617-james", "userReview": "Loved it and very nearly rated it as a 5.

Herd men, followers of a leader, cannot do that, and so it is always the herd men who win battles and the free men who win wars.\nSuch a thing is war where a haze creeps over our minds, a foggy mist of confusion that dilutes the outline of real versus unreal. Then some words are put together on makeshift pieces of paper to form a book that gets circulated stealthily and the strength is delivered. A strength which is unquantifiable and unfathomable as it is a strength of the heart. What can the enemy do to tackle it really? What torture, treachery or massacre could break this resolve? None, because those words in some surreptitious way have provided a freedom to the foggy minds. A freedom which paves an unassailable path towards a single objective of defeating the enemy.I have a very good habit of not reading the reviews before picking up a book and a very bad habit of forgetting the ones that I've read long back. So luckily for me, I didn't know the background of this novel until I read the brilliant Afterword by Donald V. Coers. Imagine my countenance when I came to know that this work by an author who I utterly adore has been labeled as \"Propaganda\" and it turned out to be successfully so. To put it simply: Through an anonymous pseudo plot, Steinbeck has written a simple yet powerful work on the Nazi occupied Norway during the WW-II. Over the period of 1940-1942, Steinbeck had actively volunteered for various government information and intelligence agencies, which brought him in contact with various displaced refugees from recently occupied countries like Norway and Denmark among others. This brought to his notice various underground resistance activities going on in their native lands, thus subsequently leading him to write this piece of fiction which was first published in USA in 1942 after making a few changes and borrowing the title from the beginning of Act 2 of Macbeth. It was released at the time of the attack on Peal Harbor, making it one of the biggest literary controversies of that time. The critics even went on to label Steinbeck as na\u00efvet\u00e9. But by this time, the book had found its way to western Europe as a stealth dagger to give it's people the much needed fuel to carry on the resistance.But, how does a man living thousands of miles away write something so simple yet powerful that most of a continent and even China for that matter, amidst the most cruel war of all time, recognize it as one of the indispensable contributors towards their independence? To which Steinbeck responded: \"I put myself in your place, and thought what I would do.\" OK sir, if you say so.All of that said, this book was different from his other works, the strong muscled The Grapes of Wrath, or the earthly wise Of Mice and Men, or the life encompassing East of Eden. It was a war book alright, but the enemy was so human, the native's emotions so palpable, the atmosphere so dense, and the revenge so deep rooted that it breaks the shackles that binds a propaganda book to the war time, and transcends to the glorious eternity. There were to be found the elements of Wodehousian humor and Dostoevskian tragic psyche too. What more could I ask for? Maybe just my epitaph by his words that would forever refuse to die against the coldest of steel."}, {"userName": "peiman-mir5 rezakhani", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2016", "userURL":

considerazioni sulle diverse linee comportamentali seguite dai vari paesi interessati allo scontro, La Luna \u00e8 tramontata \u00e8 una lucida analisi della differenza fondamentale tra il libero arbitrio, tra la pretesa alla scelta di un popolo libero (\"noi abbiamo tante teste quanta gente siamo e in momenti di necessit\u00e0 i capi sbucano fuori tra noi come funghi\" pag. 113) che pu\u00f2 decidere di continuare a combattere e resistere anche nella sconfitta, e l'uomo-gregge, seguace di un unico capo, che non pu\u00f2 farlo perch\u00e9 non autorizzato a muoversi in autonomia. L'uomo-gregge \u00e8 a suo agio quando si sente cos\u00ec apostrofato: \"devi ricevere ordini ed eseguirli. La maggior parte degli ordini sar\u00e0 spiacevole, ma questo non \u00e8 affar tuo.\" (pag.106). E questo pu\u00f2 portare uomini che pur dicono al proprio avversario \"solo per un po', non possiamo parlare tra noi come amici\" e \"sono solo fino a esserne ammalato\" (pag. 79), all'eliminazione di milioni di persone non durante - seppur cruente - azioni belliche in campo, ma in seguito ad un ordine derivato da un freddo calcolo a tavolino per pura sete di supremazia. La Luna \u00e8 tramontata \u00e8 un inno all'individualit\u00e0 della scelta, la comunanza tra uomini non \u00e8 creata dalla consapevolezza di appartenere ad un solo squadrone ma dalla dignit\u00e0 che conferisce la scelta di agire secondo principi di giustizia, anche a costo della propria vita. Le vite del sindaco Orden, del medico Winter, del giovane Alex non saranno cos\u00ec sprecate per un astratto principio, ma varranno come esempio per incitare altri a non chinare il capo, in modo che l'invasione non diventi mai conquista, ma si fermi solo ad un fragile dominio esercitato con la forza."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54697-matt", "userReview": "I read this in one night when I flopped drunk on my friend's girlfriend's couch after a night around the bars. It's so timely as to be telepathic.One character literally remarks, regarding the town his troops are occupying, how he is puzzled that there were no flowers or candy thrown at the soldiers who \"liberated\" them, as everyone had promised they would.I mean, Come On, how can that not blow your mind, just a little bit?It was written as Allied propaganda during WW2 explicity at the request of the government, with Steinbeck's full compliance.It was contraband in Italy, where one could be put to death for transmitting it. it was printed on tissue paper to be smuggled through fascist occupation and the courageous souls who took it upon themselves to get it out to the Allied soldiers narrowly missed death more than once.This is what Literature's all about- for me. Writing (and reading!) like your life depended on it. And it's immensely gratifying to know that for some, it actually did.It's not necessarily a literary masterpiece, but its of sufficient quality to be valuable as a piece of art than as a simple historical artifact.It's even sympathetic to the Nazi characters! They are portrayed as human beings, not monsters, since that would be ironically to play into the fascist game after all- didn't the Nazis, for example, attempt to claim that they were superhuman?An overtly propagandistic novel which actually addresses the humanity of the enemy (and that's quite an enemy we're talking about here) is a mightly impressive and respectable feat, says I.I'm just glad I read it. What it represents, on several levels, is gratifying and positive that this very minor book should never be forgotten."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "I went through most of my life not knowing that The Moon is Down even existed. I haven't been the most fervent fan of John Steinbeck, so that could be the explanation, but in all the classes I've been in, in all the discussions of Steinbeck's work or dicussions of stories of WWII, I've never heard of this book. When I stumbled upon it in my local used book shop I couldn't help wondering why it was new to me. I figured it must just be a terrible book, unworthy of attention, a rare Steinbeck failure, but I went ahead and bought it anyway (it was only a buck and a quarter). Then it sat on my shelf for a couple of years.I dragged it along with me to the Caribbean (where we're staying for 2014-2015), determined to give it a crack on the beach sometime. That time was over the Christmas break, and within about twenty pages I was trying to figure out the real reason for my ignorance of this book because it isn't a failure on the part of Steinbeck. The Moon is Down is sparing, as are all of Steinbeck's novellas, and there is a beauty in his chosen simplicity. The cast of scantily drawn characters seems to be a deliberate part of that simplicity. It is as though Steinbeck wants us to find ourselves in any or all of the men and women who inhabit this little world of Conquerors and (Un-)Conquered, Vanquished and (Un-)Vanquished, so he spares us too much detail that could get in the way of our ability to relate. And herein may lie the reason why The Moon is Down has been pushed to the fringes of Steinbeck's work, because the characters (at least two thirds of them) that Steinbeck wants us to relate to are Nazis inhabiting a town in the midst of WWII. We all know the discomfort that comes with being able to empathize with or relate to Nazi characters, but that discomfort can only be intensified by the fact that Steinbeck himself never gives his occupiers the name Nazi. The only place the word Nazi appears on my book, in fact, is on the back cover. I imagine anyone reading this book when it was released, or even folks who might read the book now without a back cover-spoiler, would be angered when they realized that the Nazis of Steinbeck's novella are not so different from they themselves or from their troops that might this very second be occupying another place somewhere in the world.

At the time Steinbeck came under some criticism for portraying the Germans (the conquerors were not actually identified as German in the book itself) too sympathetically, in contrast to the more virulent and crude propaganda that tried to demonize them. After the war, the work was more universally praised when it became apparent that it had greatly encouraged the resistance in Nazi-occupied countries. The novella reads much like a parable and exhibits Steinbeck's skill in characterization and psychological sensitivity. That it is meant as a work of propaganda cannot be disguised, but I think it stands as a substantive piece of literature in its own right. The work raises at least two important questions: What is the nature of propaganda itself, how can it be defined, is it a particular genre or is its categorization as propaganda determined by its intent?, these being interesting and pertinent issues for consideration; the second question in some way strikes closer to home, involving the extent to which this small tale can be transposed to the current world, specifically to the situation in, eg, Iraq, where coalition forces (if there is much of a coalition remaining) are seen by many as occupiers."}, {"userName": "Mai Laakso", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49155830-mai-laakso", "userReview": "T\u00e4m\u00e4 klassikkokirja ilmestyi Yhdysvalloissa vuonna 1942.

This is totally out of Steinbeck's typical wheelhouse of the working class in California during the 1930s. This book was used as propaganda in the Second World War and the Nazis threatened to (and probably did) kill people who were found with copies of this book. It was copied in secret and garnered some criticism for making the invaders \"human.\"I found this book fascinating. It's set up as a cautionary tale to conquerers (which are obviously the Nazis) that if you push a mild and meek people, they could have the fire switched on in them. It has the typical Steinbeck style of a colorful cast of ordinary characters who are faced with extraordinary circumstances. Humanizing the conquerors was an interesting choice and made this a human story, not just a war story. I ended up lining quotes that spoke to me about the nature of mankind. The build-up to the end raised it a half star but the ambiguous ending kept this book from a solid 4-star rating for me. I would recommend it if you are a Steinbeck fan and want to read something different than his more famous works.

The town is important because it is a port that serves a large coal mine. Colonel Lanser, the head of the invading battalion, along with his staff establishes his HQ in the house of the democratically elected and popular Mayor Orden.As the reality of occupation sinks in and the weather turns bleak, with the snows beginning earlier than usual, the \"simple, peaceful people\" of the town are angry and confused. Colonel Lanser, a veteran of many wars, tries to operate under a veil of civility and law, but in his heart he knows that \"there are no peaceful people\" amongst those whose freedom has been taken away by force. The veil is soon torn apart when Alexander Morden, an erstwhile alderman and \"a free man,\" is ordered to work in the mine. He strikes out at Captain Loft with a pick axe, but Captain Bentick steps into its path and dies of it. After a summary trial, Morden is executed by a firing squad. This incident catalyzes the people of the town and they settle into \"a slow, silent, waiting revenge.\" Sections of the railroad linking the port with the mine get damaged regularly, the machinery breaks down often, and the dynamo of the electricity generators gets short circuited. Whenever a soldier relaxes his guard, drinks or goes out with a woman, he is killed. Mayor Orden stands by his people, and tries to explain to Col. Lanser that his goal \u2013 \"to break man\u2019s spirit permanently\" \u2013 is impossible.The cold weather and the constant fear weighs heavy on the occupying force, many of whom wish the war to end so that they can return home. They realize the futility of the war and that \"the flies have conquered the flypaper.\" Some members of the resistance escape to England and ask the English for explosives so that the townspeople can intensify their efforts. English planes parachute-drop small packages containing dynamite sticks and chocolates all around the town. In a state of panic, the army takes the Mayor and his friend Dr. Winter, the town doctor and historian, hostage and lets it be known that any action from resistance will lead to their execution. Mayor Orden knows that nothing can stop his people and that his death is imminent. He tells his wife that while he can be killed, the idea of Mayor (and freedom and democracy) is beyond the reach of any army. Before his execution, Mayor Orden reminds Dr. Winter of the dialogues of Socrates in the Apology, a part he played in the high school play, and tells him to make sure that the debt is repaid to the army, i.e., that the resistance is continued.", "title": "The Moon Is Down", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12722.The_Moon_Is_Down", "average": 3.88, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1327961310l/12722.jpg", "reviews": 1170, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/585.John_Steinbeck", "name": "John Steinbeck"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Classics", "Historical", "War", "Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12722.The_Moon_Is_Down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17609255-the-moon-is-down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25862783", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1306200._", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28671942", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6397027-the-moon-is-down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4829976-the-moon-is-down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17191042", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22294464-the-moon-is-down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9700420-la-luna-tramontata", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1231183.The_Moon_is_Down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30780705-ay-batarken", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10838604-the-moon-is-down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/763808.The_Moon_Is_Down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17732398-routakuun-aika", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13541493", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2440393.The_Moon_Is_Down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33644788-ay-batt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12460863-la-luna-tramontata", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12183136-the-moon-is-down", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/890.Of_Mice_and_Men", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4406.East_of_Eden", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18114322-the-grapes-of-wrath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5308.The_Pearl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4799.Cannery_Row"]}
