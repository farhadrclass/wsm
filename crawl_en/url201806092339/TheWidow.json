This is...fine, but not particularly outstanding as thriller, as character study, or as dissection of a marriage; really, it feels like it just doesn't have much to say. It doesn't take long for readers to know one of the primary narrators is seriously unhinged, but even that POV didn't provide much interest--and it should have. (You could have lost the frequency of some of those other POVs without much impact, too.) It's also remarkable how lacking in tension this felt, and how facile the emotions and plot machinations. And given how serious the crimes were, the writing style and glossing over of certain scenarios or lack of detail often felt like a cop-out. There's something about the slightly arch, knowing tone that rubs me the wrong way for this story, too. I don't mind and have enjoyed humorous or facetious treatment in other crime novels, but when you're dealing with a child who's in serious danger, much of my tolerance for that sort of thing goes out the window. (TAMPA and I HUNT KILLERS being among the rare exceptions to that statement.) Were you not supposed to care about the victims at all? Was this supposed to feel distant/occasionally humorous? On the one hand, it does work in the plot's withholding-key-information/half-unreliable narrator thing. But on the other hand, it's kind of sad I can't tell. I dunno. This one's gotten a lot of rave reviews thus far and is apparently poised to be a runaway hit. Go ahead on without me, book.

Cause I will provide snacks at all the meetings and get cutsie t-shirts made on my own damn dime.The book jacket for The Widow by Fiona Barton would have you believe that you are about to read a psychological thriller all about the widow of a man accused and found guilty (in the court of public opinion at least) of kidnapping and murdering a two year old girl who's remains have never been found. She's spent her life covering for him and supporting him but he's dead now and she doesn't have to do that anymore. Reporters and news agencies are desperate to score an interview with her and the police are still sniffing around but she knows the score. She knows they all want the truth and she knows they'll pay to get it and she's such a master of manipulation that she can make them believe anything.The book jacket says that's what this is about. But the book jacket is a LIE!This book is about a dishrag of a woman who married a horrible man who's probably a child murdering pedophile. She continues to be a dishrag after he is dead. She's mousy and introverted and has to be told to eat or she'd starve to death. Its about her telling incredibly boring stories about how horrible he was. Its about some reporter trying to get her to tell her story and some cop who shows up repeatedly to get her to tell him where the body is. It is also boring, boring, boring.I'd say the biggest problem is there is absolutely no mystery here. You are told whats going on, you already know who did it, and then you get to the end where what you already knew is verified by the characters and (if you are me) you put the book down and stare at it quizzically for a minute thinking \"heh?\"Look I'm not saying that every mystery has to have a twist ending but don't sucker me into thinking I'm going to read a book about a woman who's such a master manipulator that she's managed to con a pedophile into marrying her so she can use him as a scapegoat, or a book about a quick witted narcissist who's playing every single person she encounters who think they can get her to do anything when you're really writing some kind of lame character study.This was honestly a huge waste of time. Its not badly written but there is also absolutely no story. The \"plot\" is just typical Lifetime Movie tropisms about husband's with secrets (that we already know) and the sad sacks that marry them because they were put under the guy's amazing speeelllll."}, {"userName": "Deanna ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15662887-deanna", "userReview": "3.5 StarsI've now listened to a quite a few audio-books and I'm starting to enjoy them more and more. There have been one or two that I didn't care for, but that may have been the same if I had read the book. I was intrigued when I read the description for this book. However, of course it had to be touted as the next GONE GIRL or GIRL ON A TRAIN (I really hope they stop doing that). I guess I should just be happy that the title didn't have the word GIRL in it. I thought it sounded pretty interesting. \"an electrifying thriller that will take you into the dark spaces that exist between a husband and a wife\"I wouldn't say that I was electrified but I enjoyed this audio. I was very impressed by the multiple narrators, they were all very easy on the ears. I also liked how it was clear who was speaking and what date it was. This was really helpful as the story alternates back and forth from 2006 to 2010. Told from the viewpoints of The Widow (Jean), The Detective, The Reporter, The Husband (Glenn), and The Mother. So although there were many different characters, I found it easy to keep track of whose point of view it was, even with the time shift. The majority of the story is told from Jean/Jeanie Taylor's (The Widow) point of view. Jean's husband Glenn was just killed in a freak bus accident. We find out that prior to the accident Glenn was accused of kidnapping a two-year-old child, named Bella. Jeannie has stood by Glenn. She may have been a bit concerned about his online actions that she calls \"his nonsense\" but he can't possibly have committed such a heinous crime because as Jeannie says \"Glenn loves children\". \u201cThe simple lies are the hardest, funnily enough. The big ones seem to just fall off the tongue\"Overall, this was an enjoyable psychological suspense novel. I really enjoyed hearing the story from all the different perspectives.

I SO wanted to love this one. The one everyone's going to be talking about apparently. Well yes, that's actually entirely possible - it is a novel of the type very much in the public eye at the moment, domestic noir, unreliable narrator, girls, sisters, daughters, wives or whatever and secrets.Fiona Barton writes extremely well in places, I have no problem whatsoever with that, knows how to pull you into a story yes, pootles around the reveals yes - The Widow has a high readability factor in many ways. If it wasn't for the fact that I'd read this book twice a month on average this year I might even be raving about it. Might. And it's definitely not a bad book in that sense - I'm sure it will gain a lot of fans, and within it's market is bound to do well. But then...I came out of it feeling fairly bored by the whole affair ultimately. I could have read the first and last chapters (in fact I probably didn't need to read the last one to be honest I had that ending down around page 4)and filled in the rest for myself whilst doing something else. Which isn't to say I didn't enjoy reading it because I did - It just didn't feel like an actual requirement to finding out what The Widow knew. And for me....The Widow herself was inordinately whiny and annoying. On top of that the police were stupid. I mean STUPID. Not \"oops we missed this it happens sometimes\" errors but completely and utterly stupid. If I were a policeman reading this book I'd be grinding my teeth and throwing shoes at people. I find it highly unlikely actually that an investigation of this nature would have so many glaring holes in it - to the point of wondering if perhaps the investigative team in this story had actually been replaced after a page or two by the three stooges and you'd just missed that part.The one thing I will say is that Fiona Barton does bring a deep authenticity to the subject she knows - that of Journalism. That's not to say the Press were not also a bit annoying but only in their normal must have the story press fashion and in fact the \"Reporter\" elements of the narrative were the ones I enjoyed the most. Kate was one of the few characters who was not either stupid or annoying. Kate and Eileen - the detectives wife who gets about 4 sentences in the entire novel and yet somehow manages to have more savvy and common sense than the rest of the cast put together - were people I could get behind.The trouble is that I am overloaded with these types of novels perhaps. My problems with The Widow are similar to the problems a lot of readers had with The Girl on a Train and Disclaimer (two books that actually I loved so there's your reading mantra, we all see things differently) And it's nothing new. Its not even improved in my opinion. It just is what it is - a reasonable readable example of its thing - it didn't blow me away with a killer ending like The Sisters, it didn't do anything particularly insightful really, and there was kind of an emotional disconnect when it came to the thing that SHOULD have really gotten to me - the fact that a child was missing.Bella. She was kind of secondary to the whole thing. Even the lead detective's angst about being unable to find her and his obsession with the case fell flat for me because I've seen it all before, and he was kind of one dimensional.Burnt Paper Sky - a novel that deals with a lot of similar themes (The press, the internet, looking at it from a specific point of view in that case the Mother of the missing child rather than the widow of the accused) has done all this but better. With a real depth of emotion and a real feel for the subject material. In this readers opinion, The Widow, whilst it does have the edge on the Press point of view and has some fascinating engagement there - has done this genre by numbers and given us another book that has the same basic story as too many others that have been released in the last two years. Therefore unless it has something particularly special (and it CAN still be done believe me) it is not going to get my heart pumping.The Gone Girl Wagon trail. It's a long and winding one it seems. 2* and a very subjective review.

Despite the flaws, I think there are promising signs. The writing was assured and each character voice had its own positives, even if the people were quite unremarkable. I'm certainly not convinced I'd like the police in this novel to investigate my disappearance. I'd give them 2/10 for intelligence and effort. The plot came from a very interesting concept and, as a hook, really made me think the book was going to offer something surprising. Barton's note at the beginning was intriguing- who are those people that stand behind the men/women who are branded a 'monster' for their crimes? Now that's a question I want answered. After reading, I still do. However, it didn't quite live up to its promise. I was excited that, three quarters through, I still wasn't completely sure who the killer was or who was/wasn't telling the truth/what else people were hiding. This was because I wasn't accepting anything at face value and was waiting for the moment of surprise. Which wasn't there. Maybe if I hadn't been banking on that twist, I might have been less disappointed, but in the end, the book was just ok. When stacked against some of the other psychological thrillers out there, it doesn't really cut it.

No doubt the packing, publicity and (yet again) comparison to Gone Girl\u2014I mean, how many Gone Girls can there be! (But I guess we do keep falling for it, so it works)\u2014have helped to propel it onto the NYT. It\u2019s often a bit like watching a toddler on a tricycle when you buy one of those novels, you know. It\u2019s like, can the work ride on its own right out of the gate, or will it be wobbly on the training wheels that the publisher and public expectations have placed on it, needing them as props? Will it fall over altogether? I\u2019m happy to say that this one held its own!The Widow had an excellent start that immediately grabbed me. It was consistent in its format, if not always fluid in the reading of it, and had an element of creepiness to it that warranted its label \u201cpsychological\u201d thriller when used. Some may not like \u201ccreepy\u201d or the way that it was offered here, but I LOVE it because it\u2019s so much harder to pull off than \u201cscary\u201d or \u201cgross.\u201d \u201cCreepy\u201d toys with the mind in its subtlety. Honestly, I felt chills and echoes from \u201cThe Yellow Wallpaper,\u201d one of my all-time favorite short stories, so this one had me from the start, and it was up to Barton to keep me hooked all the way through. She did. Control is a major theme in this one, and I loved that because it takes control of the author\u2019s hand to be able to portray that in the way intended and in all of the different ways that it came up here. Here you have a ditsy housewife\u2014who maybe isn\u2019t so ditsy\u2014who\u2019s controlled by her husband (to an alarming and almost sinister extent), by the reporter and the media, by everyone in her world, really. Until. And it\u2019s that until that shapes the novel in a lot of ways. The Widow is not a novel where the crime is revealed up front, thankfully. In fact, for the majority of the novel, you\u2019re not really sure of what happened, and in what sequence and why. That\u2019s the \u201cthrill\u201d of it; it allowed for a wonderful building of subtle tension. There are splashes of humor and pondering from Jean\u2019s thoughts that often border on disturbing when not surprisingly clear and aware. I even liked that the chapters skipped around, never in chronological order. It made the read a little more \u201cthrilling,\u201d not know which voice or occurrence would happen next, until the end when it got a bit jumbled for me for some reason. Navi followers know that I\u2019m a stickler for voice and dialogue, and The Widow had that in its own right. It\u2019s not that the voices were particularly unique to each other, though Jean and Glen\u2019s were, but that they were all so deeply embedded in a place (London) that the novel had a true concept of setting. I picked this one up not sure of what expectations to have, this being a debut and all, and that\u2019s a delicious thing in itself: being able to go into something clean of prejudice or bias. The Widow had resonance. It offered those shards of thought, of dialogue, of wit that ring so true that they\u2019re undeniable and, to some, possibly even a little off-putting. This was a great debut from Barton, and her experience in journalism came through. She offered insight into the world of breaking news media with a naturalness that can only come from a creature in their own element. You can always tell a fish out of water when they write about things they\u2019re really not familiar with, and this novel did not have that issue. I thoroughly enjoyed this work and would read another from her. This novel is not a fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants thrill ride; hint, that\u2019s why they put the word \u201cpsychological\u201d in there. I will say that I wouldn\u2019t mind a bit more closure on this one, though; that\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about that.

Giving it 4 stars versus 3 though, so that says something.First, there is the ever annoying references to Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train. I really wish publishers would stop doing this. Yes, it piques my interest, but I find myself looking for the correlation and it's typically lacking like in this case. This is a good read, but really not comparable to those two.Second, I didn't like one single character in the whole story. Not even the hard working detective who's soul got sucked away by this case. Third, I found the jumping around between chapters to be confusing. Each chapter was dated, and often would jump from present time to the past. I had to go back to the start of each chapter many times to confirm which time frame it was in.But...there was a lot of good in this book that I did like, for example: -It certainly kept me guessing! I changed my mind about who was involved several times. -I liked the way the author played with my emotions. First I was sympathetic, then I was frustrated, then angry, etc. -While I didn't like any of the characters, I have to say the author certainly made them memorable with unique quirks and flaws. -I'm waffling on the ending...at first I thought it was brilliant, now I'm wanting more closure.I think it's a worthy read and I do recommend-the author has a unique voice, and I will be looking for more of her work.ARC provided by Netgalley-many thanks!"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32799998-erin", "userReview": "The Widow is not a book filled with twists & turns so I wouldn't consider it a thriller.

So I\u2019ve already written a review recently about the bumper crop of child abduction themed books I\u2019ve read in the last year. And here\u2019s another one. I swear that I didn\u2019t know that The Widow focused on another disappearing child. I probably should have read the blurb more carefully, but the title in fairness does not suggest child abduction. Anyways, as I point out in my review of What She Knew, I\u2019ve quite enjoyed some of these books although I swear it\u2019s not a theme I seek out. But that means that The Widow was up against some pretty stiff competition. The Widow was okay, but I must admit that I found it a tad dull \u2013 especially compared to What She Knew or What Was Mine \u2013 and creepy in not a particularly good way. The Widow is told primarily from Jean Taylor\u2019s point of view. Her husband Glenn has recently been run over by a bus, and the narrative recounts the events leading up to the accident. From early on, we find out that Glenn has been accused of abducting 2 year old Bella. The story jumps around in time from Bella\u2019s abduction to Glen\u2019s death, slowly revealing what happened and Jean\u2019s perspective on the whole thing. Occasionally, we also see things through the eyes of an eager journalist and a frustrated police officer. As I said, I found it kind of flat \u2013 the reveal at the end felt more like a fizzle than a dramatic finish. And it was all a bit \"get under your skin\" creepy \u2013 I didn\u2019t feel much sympathy toward Jean although I suspect that I was meant to. On the plus side, there is no explicit violence. True fans of the suspense genre might enjoy this one more than I did \u2013 I\u2019m just a fickle dabbler.

We eventually learn what truly happened using a plot development told in shifting time frames and the five character narratives of The Widow, The Detective, The Reporter, The Husband, and The Mother. What stood out for me was the tug of war that Glen\u2019s deeds caused Jeanie. Could she believe Glen that he was not responsible for Bella\u2019s disappearance? Could she continue to stand by him knowing that he might have done just that? The Widow is not fast paced but a good psychological study and surprised me in the end, satisfying this reader. Penguin Random House\u2019s multi-cast production of The Widow is expertly narrated by Hannah Curtis as The Widow, Nicolas Guy Smith as The Detective, Mandy Williams as The Reporter, reading the three main roles.

Jean, ever the dutiful wife, stands by her man despite the things she discovers about him along the way.After Glen's death, everyone wants to talk to 'the widow', sure she knows more than she let on, hopeful that she will reveal all now that Glen is not there to control her.This is a beautifully written debut book and I look forward to reading more from Fiona Barton.Thank you to NetGalley and Random House UK, Transworld Publishers, Bantam Press for providing an ARC of this book in exchange for an honest unbiased review."}, {"userName": "\u2665 Jx PinkLady Reviews \u2665 ", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16496589-jx-pinklady-reviews", "userReview": "3.5 - 4 StarsThe widow is a fast paced thriller that opens with the female protagonist telling the reader her husband has just died in front of her eyes. A husband who was suspected of committing a deplorable crime some years ago. As the story unfolds showcasing the past and present, the reader learns more about more about the relationship between husband and wife, the crime he was accused of and the actions of Jean Taylor and her character. Despite the rapid page-turning aspect of this novel, I can't say I always enjoyed the story arc because of the often sheer ugliness of the subject matter. A friend of mine referred to it as distasteful and she has a definite point as there are times it felt uncomfortable to the max, however, there's no doubt that I was addicted to discovering the absolute truth of the crime. Did he do it? Did she know? The Widow was read by my local book club and there was a definite mix of those who were not entirely enamoured with the story and those who very much enjoyed. There\u2019s an element that I felt was easily worked out from the beginning but this kind of added to my reading experience.

It is the story of Jean Taylor whose husband Glen is the suspect of a horrific crime. We have all seen women like Jean on the news, standing beside their husbands on the court steps, looking supportive, being their rocks. But, what is going on inside their minds? Do they really believe their husbands\u2019 cries of innocence or are they covering up for them, or indeed are they the masterminds behind the crime? It seemed like a pleasant change from the normal scenarios for crime/psychological thriller type reads.The story starts off very strongly and I enjoyed it at first but to be honest it fizzles out pretty quickly. It is told from multiple viewpoints, including that of a detective Bob Sparkes and a newspaper reporter Kate. Jean, as a character, in all fairness isn\u2019t strong enough to carry the story on her own. She comes across as very nondescript, dull and boring. I could picture her dressed in beige. I also had great trouble in believing that she was only 39 years old, she seemed to act and talk like someone much older. I think that could partly be blamed on her name as well. I don\u2019t many Jeans but those I do know are a lot older, it isn\u2019t a name you would normally associate with someone of her age. She doesn\u2019t do a lot for most of the read, and not much happens to her, most of the action seems to go on around her.After a while the story does start to drag a bit, especially with the overlap in some of the different viewpoints. There is a surprise towards the end but in all fairness it didn\u2019t really come as that much of a surprise because I had figured it out pretty much straightaway.

The inspiration for this debut novel stemmed from all the people on the edge of high profile crimes: the wives, the parents, the children of the perpetrators. Ms. Barton recognized that these individuals are often just as affected by events, but all the focus is elsewhere. She often wondered what they knew and what they should have known. So she gained further inspiration from documented criminal cases as well as her own imagination and wrote a story about the widow of a man found guilty of a horrible crime. The story is told through the perspectives of five different characters and the time frames fluctuate from present to past and back again. In The Widow, Ms. Barton wrote about a parent's worst nightmare and the investigation that ensues. She wrote about the alleged perpetrator and the submissive little wife that stayed by his side. She wrote about the behavior and tactics used in journalism to score the coveted story. But ultimately, she wrote about power dynamics in relationships, whether it's between a husband and wife or a journalist and subject. Is the dominant personality really the one in charge? When all is said and done, who actually holds the power? The Widow is layered with complex characters who may end up surprising you. This was a good book and I enjoyed it a great deal. Check it out! My favorite quote:\"He looks like the bloke next door. But then monsters rarely look the part. You hope you'll be able to see the evil shining out of them - it would make police work a damn sight easier. But evil was a slippery substance, glimpsed only occasionally and all the more horrifying for that.\""}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Once I finished this book, I had to let it settle in my mind for a little while. Now that I\u2018ve had time to reflect on it all, I believe the plot is well written and very crafty. It\u2019s a stinging rebuke, an accurate illustration of society and its underbelly, but is also a clever mystery. The characterizations are so vivid, they are hard to accept at times, and no, you probably won\u2019t care for most of the characters, except perhaps the detectives working the case, although they too have their foibles. So, in conclusion, I would strongly urge those fans of suspense and psychological thrillers, to approach this book with an open mind, and allow it to stand on its own merits, which it is quite capable of doing without further comparisons.This review is the copyrighted property of Night Owl Reviews.

When the ensuing investigation leads to a seemingly unlikely suspect, everyone involved is put on display in the search for the truth and the missing child. And to say much of it is unflattering is an understatement, especially after the primary suspect is killed in a bizarre accident.The story is told in alternating points of view from the lead detective, a key reporter, the mother and the wife of the suspect (there are a couple of others who only have one scene). It's also presented using flashbacks, a device I normally enjoy but here it was confusing, primarily because of the multiple points of view and it didn't follow a coherent path. In spite of this, I found the story interesting and many of the characters equally disagreeable and compelling. The role of the media in these circumstances is also an important part of the plot, leaving the reader to decide the merits of what they do. The narration was very well done and I found the use of multiple performers essential, especially given the alternating points of view and flashbacks. Each performer seemed to perfectly capture his/her character and helped me digest the story more easily. I think my experience would have been less enjoyable if I'd read the book. This was an interesting and disturbing story, not just because of the subject matter but the disappointing behaviors of most of those involved. It cuts too closely to reality. 3.5 stars(I received an ARC from the publisher in exchange for an honest review)"}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36555254-robin", "userReview": "I wish booksellers and reviewers would stop comparing each and every thriller with a slight twist of plot to Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train. I've read both and this book doesn't resemble either of them, remotely.It's a debut book for Fiona Barton. Interesting that she chose to focus on the wife (and then widow) of the accused child kidnapper and perhaps killer. The point of view flipped between the widow, the cop, the journalist, the mother of the missing girl, and the widow's husband. Still not sure if this head-hopping really works, since the whole idea of the book was seeing it from the widow's point of view (and the other characters were wooden and one-dimensional).The book is only okay for me. It was easy to follow, a fast paced read. But the characters were kind of flat. I was propelled along only by the morbid curiosity of what was going to pop out of the box at the end rather than caring about any of the players.

The premise for the story is great, but I don't want to say too much more or I may give parts of the plot away.

I didn't realize that this is the authors debut book. Ignorance is bliss....Until I started reading it and got messages like..\"You are going to enjoy this Sue\"and\"Its an amazing read\"When I hear that, I think....hhmmmm I hope so.But if its from some reviewers who I know is 'spot on' then it makes all the difference and I got some of those, so I thought.....yes!I have to honestly say that I am gobsmacked this is Fiona Barton's debut book. It has class, it has all the elements of a brilliant thriller, its paced well, the characters are 'real' you can actually reach out and touch them.I don't know what I can say about this story that hasn't already been said without giving the plot away, but I will try.At first, Jean came across to me as a weak flimsy wife. A woman who had no control over her life and she did everything her husband told her.Her husband Glen is found to be a porn addict. He excuses himself and goes off to another room in the house a lot. He likes cyber sex and woman dressed as young children.A child goes missing. Taken.Is Glen the person who took her? Is Glens sexual addiction, kinky and worrying taken him onto paths leading to bigger crimes?Did Jean know?Jean believed in her husband, she stood by him, its unbelievable he would do \"such a thing\".When Jeanie finds out...Glen explains \"Its not real Jeanie, its fantasy, these are women in their 30s dressing up as children\"They said so in court so it has to be true right?Jean is not convinced at first \"They do this for men who want to do this to children\" Its sick right?Jean thinks maybe its a man's 'way', its just a 'man thing'But Bella the little girl is still missing.Jeanie had a secret obsession. She wanted a baby but couldn't have one because of Glen.Glens way of dealing with any problems in life is...draw a line in it and never to speak of it again.But Jeanie has an obsession...This being Fiona Barton's first book is amazing, this is certainly someone I will be following. I have connected with her on Facebook and Twitter.

Even though this is a debut, (shocking), this is not Barton\u2019s first rodeo. Have you read her bio? Impressive.While readers seem to be flocking to psychological suspense and suburban noirs---2016 brings a mix of the hottest new genre, following the sensational Gone Girl and The Girl on the Train.  Barton  masters the craft with her haunting creation.  (I actually liked it better than the aforementioned).  Filled with complex and intimate glimpses into the lives ruled by obsession, crisis, and fear; where mood and characters drive the novel\u2014Thought-provoking; creating a dark, chilling, disturbing and unsettling tone. Meet Jean Taylor,  The Widow. She is the heart of the story. A complex woman of many faces. As the novel opens, it is 2010.  Jean is hiding out from reporters, as she has done for years. She has managed to stay clear; however, this time there is a different \"vulture\" calling, with her own agenda. Kate Waters, a tenacious reporter from the Daily Post. She is crafty and works herself smoothly inside the door, for her kill.Why the interest in Jean?Kate wants the story. A trained observer. She can taste the story. The story of Jean\u2019s life with her killer husband, Glen. The real truth about Glen. Bella, the baby girl. He died the previous week, knocked down by a bus just outside Sainsbury. Accident, pushed, or suicide?Is Jean really sad about Glen dying? Or, did she just dream of him dying? (with a devious smile). A grieving widow, or a happy one behind her veil?Jean and Glen  met when she was only seventeen years old. She, an apprentice at a hairdresser in Greenwich. Glen worked at a bank. He was a bit older. Good-looking. He was protective, neat, and romantic. She was messy. They were married when she was nineteen. What does Jean really know about Glen? What does he know about her? The intimate lives of a marriage. A husband and wife. No children. Addictions. For better or worse; a marriage vow. Meet the cast:  Dawn: A single young mother with a two- year- old daughter, Bella. Abducted from her own back yard.Bob: The detective who is obsessed with finding the little girl. Desperate to prove Glen\u2019s guilt. Glen: The manipulative monster. A liar. A pedophile? A murderer? What is he really doing at night behind closed doors in front of the computer? His secrets. Accused of a brutal crime. Is he guilty or innocent? After getting laid (fired) off at the bank he was a delivery driver. A van. He wanted to start his own business. The unraveling. Guilty, not guilty?Jean: She does what Glen says. Glen is her husband. Is she naive? She loves her husband. He could not do terrible things. Is she too, one of Glen\u2019s victims? Under his control? Does she believe his lies, or is she as twisted as her husband? Does she have her own agenda? An obsession and desire for a baby. She is weak, clever, and manipulative. She plays two parts. Why would a woman stay with a man who looks at child abuse on their computer? What is the hold?Kate: A strong personality. (loved her) She wants more than anything to be the one to get the truth. She can taste it. Social media, journalism, and cop procedures play a big role in the novel-- ideal for further discussions. Let the games begin.  Flashing back and from 2006 to 2010, readers learn about the abduction. This event sets everything in motion. What happened to Baby Bella? There is much to explore in the four- year period. Unprofessional behavior, inappropriate, termination. The end of their dreams. None of this was Glen\u2019s fault. After all Jean (Jeanie) was his world, he leads her to believe. An investigation. Now, with him dead, they only have Jean to lead them to the truth. Where is Bella? Does Jean know what Glen did with Bella? An intriguing puzzle.  Jean is in control. Whether fake or real. Barton\u2019s crafty skills are reflective throughout this ongoing nightmare. An abduction which only took minutes. Even though Jean dominates, readers learn perspectives from the important players. Atmospheric.  Doubt. There\u2019s a dark, growing sense of foreboding; however, the compelling pace stems not so much from the actual action, but from the intensity of the mood. Disturbing, Creepy, and Unsettling. THE WIDOW plays with your mind\u2026leaving the reader wondering about the authenticity of the character. Barton takes you inside their complex minds. This is where I see a difference of opinions within the reviews posted. The novel plays with the readers\u2019 mind. Internal psychological monsters are at play, versus external ones. Intensity. The obsession. The changing of the character from beginning to the end captures you. The \"reveal\" is the changing of your perspective of the characters from the beginning of the book to the end. Inward, versus outward. Tortured relationships. Obsessions. Emphasizing the psychology of its characters and their unstable emotional states. While reading, you will experience an array of emotion from doubt, fear, disgust, and in the end a satisfying twist.Psychological suspense crosses suburban noir.  Where characters are wounded and flawed, yearning for something they can\u2019t define. A toxic marriage, greed, envy, discontent, fear. Off-balance, driven to crime by mental and emotional forces they\u2019re unable to control\u2014how many are in your own neighborhood? Obsessed, paranoid, desperate to find happiness, and clinging to their sense of security. A scary thought. An excellent choice for book clubs or further discussions.  An author to follow!

For me personally, it didn't live up to its promise. To start with, I didn't find it thrilling. It was more of a slow burner, and I had no difficulties putting it down at any time. I love thrillers that have a few surprises and maybe an unexpected final twist or at least something that makes me think 'oh that was clever'. I kept waiting and telling myself to read on because surely there would be something that wasn't as it seemed, but unfortunately there were no great twists, no final breathtaking reveals, it all played out exactly as one could have predicted from fairly early on. The character of the widow was dull. I pictured her as an ancient lady dressed in a light brown housedress with a tight perm, but she was supposed to be late thirties/early forties. The police were simply utterly incompetent in their investigation. The young, single mother of the abducted child was clich\u00e9d. The reporter was unlikable but at least had some spark. The media aspect was actually the most interesting part of this.
