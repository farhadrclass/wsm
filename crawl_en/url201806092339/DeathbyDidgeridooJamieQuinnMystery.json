I enjoyed reading this book, but it is a very short read to introduce you to the main characters, setting and background -- definitely worth the read to give you a taste for what's to come in the series.\nStory\nWhen Jamie's cousin Adam, a 22 year old with Asperger's Syndrome, is accused of killing his music teacher with a didgeridoo (a musical instrument), his mother Peg calls Jamie for help. Jamie's own mother passed away which is why Jamie feels more closely connected to her aunt and cousin as some of her only remaining family; however, Jamie is a family law practitioner, not a criminal lawyer. She uses her sharp wit, intelligence and connections to determine the potential real suspects and finds herself embroiled in a mystery of a music band where a number of members and their fan groupies may have been responsible. In the end, Jamie saves the day with help from her bestie Grace (a criminal lawyer) and PI Duke, who is also a former client of hers when he had his own womanizing ways!\nStrengths\nThe story is narrated in first person which gives the author valuable liberties with Jamie's personality. Jamie can easily tell you what she's seeing and thinking while also giving her opinion and stepping out of the story to make you laugh. There are a number of funny lines that quickly give you a sense of Jamie's personality making you wish you had a friend just like her -- especially when many are at her own expense. It's just the right balance of humor/fun without causing any intrusion into the overall story. I enjoy cozies that can go that extra step but still keep everything moving along.Having a lawyer as the protagonist (especially when the story is written by a lawyer) also helps with storyline potential -- think of all the murders, court room dramas and legal proceedings you as a reader will get to experience. The author does a good job at not using too much legal-speak to make the read cumbersome which helps keep the story flowing along.The murder, in traditional cozy format, happens off screen. There is very little focus on the description other than knowing about the blood and the weapon. For the most part, I think this is a good approach, as the reader has a lot to go on with his/her own imagination. I also like the ingenuity with the murder weapon as I think this may be the first time it's ever been used in a book (reviewers note -- I surprisingly have \nnot\n read every book in the universe so I cannot be absolutely certain on this!). \nSuggestions\nIt was too short and quick. I read this on my iPad Kindle program on a plane trip from Atlanta to NY and finished it in less than two hours (it's about 100 pages). The story is good and has a definite murder setup, multiple cast of suspects and a few side stories -- it's a direct path to solving the whodunit with a few red herrings along the way. I would have liked to see some additional details surrounding the different band members so that I could try to figure out which one may have been the culprit. It sometimes felt a little bit like it went too quickly to finding the actual killer, especially when a second victim shows up and the story is quicky solved. But I believe since this was a debut novel, it was done to get interest in the characters and setting and will expand more in future books.\nFinal Thoughts\nThis debut was a good example of humor in a cozy and will delight readers who like a strong female lead character with the right group of friends in the legal and police fields to help her solve the cases. This particular story had many different characters who could have been the killer and you clearly know from the beginning it couldn't be the one suspect the police blamed. I'm looking forward to seeing a longer and more complex story in the next two books in the series. I've already downloaded them and will probably switch back and forth between a few series over the next couple of weeks. Nice debut work!"}, {"userName": "Evgeny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9340136-evgeny", "userReview": "Jamie Quinn is a thirty-something lawyer specializing in divorce cases. She is completely broken after the death of her mother and spends her time staying at home. As a side note: I really wish I had a life where I could afford to stay at home instead of going to work when I feel like it. A phone call from her aunt finally makes her to take some action. Her nephew is accused of a murder of a former rock star. The nephew has Asperger\u2019s Syndrome. The victim had lots of enemies. Jamie has no clue about criminal defense. It is any wonder she takes the case? First things first: what the heck is didgeridoo? It is a murder weapon used as a club. If you have any doubts whether it can be used as such, take a look at the following:I liked Jamie Quinn as a character. While she is shown at the bad time of her life she still has a healthy sense of irony and some humor which sets the tone for the whole story. The character works for a plot novella and I hope it will improve in further stories of the series. There were some other good characters which did not get much screen time due to the length of the book. The writing style is decent and serviceable in this case. The whole book is a short but easy read with the total rating of 3.5 stars rounded up for the reason that it does a good job as a series' pilot."}, {"userName": "PattyMacDotComma", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1128612-pattymacdotcomma", "userReview": "3.5\u2605\u201cThanks, Duke!

I wouldn't mind a bit.\u2019This is bright and breezy, the first of a series. Jamie is an attractive young lawyer in Hollywood \u2013 no not star-studded California, but a Florida town - and to help her find out more about a case, she\u2019s hired Duke, a bit of a rough and ready private investigator with a colourful history. Adam is her cousin, accused of murdering his music teacher by bashing him with a didgeridoo. Jamie needs help.Jamie and Adam\u2019s mother, her Aunt Peg, haven\u2019t been close the past year since Jamie\u2019s mother (Peg\u2019s sister) died, and both have retreated into their grief. But Adam is a 22-year-old with Asperger\u2019s Syndrome, and he needs special help with this predicament. Easily stressed, he\u2019s shut down, covered with blood at the scene of the murder.Worse, the didge was his own, that he\u2019d taken to his music teacher to show what he\u2019d learned. (A didgeridoo is an Australian Aboriginal instrument, a long, slender, hollowed-out \u201clog\u201d into which the player blows a continuous breath, kind of like a bagpipe \u2013 but not.)This is something of a light-hearted romp, with some touching reminiscing about Jamie\u2019s family and a lot of semi-flirty banter between Jamie and Duke, who fancies himself something of a professional charmer. The conversation I quoted is typical of the dialogue.It\u2019s only a short novella, and I enjoyed meeting Jamie Quinn, Duke, and Grace, Jamie\u2019s best friend and a fellow lawyer on whom she relies for criminal law advice.Thanks to the author for a copy for review.

It also means that we are coming to the end of the book challenge for goodreads and I\u2019m barely on track this year. So what is a girl to do? Well she finds some stories that might be a little shorter and she can fit in easily between all her other life obligations.Enter Death by Didgeridoo a short story mystery available in audio format (since that is how I read about \u00bd my books) that will take under three hours to listen to. Jamie Quinn is a woman suffering from light depression after the death of her mother. She is taking some time off work to really look at her life and decide if she is doing what she really wants to do with it or if it is time for a direction change. That is when she gets the call that her Nephew who suffers from Asperger\u2019s Syndrome has been arrested on murder charges. Well Jamie is the family lawyer so she has to go help even if her family doesn\u2019t realize that just because she is a lawyer doesn\u2019t mean that she is a criminal attorney. But the least she can do is try and help out her sweet nephew and try to clear up a misunderstanding.This short story has a few fun characters. Most notable is Duke the slightly shade PI who hasn\u2019t found a woman he didn\u2019t want to flirt with. Jamie herself is pretty likable as she pulls herself out of a depression and isolation to help investigate who could have perpetrated the murder. Since this is just a short story you aren\u2019t going to get really in depth characters or super plot twists. There just isn\u2019t time for all that. What you will get is a pretty good who-dun-it with quite a few suspects to chose from and a quick resolution.Rating Note: Since this is a short story it gets a few passes on thing I would look for in a longer Mystery. I just want it clear that this is more like an episode on a t.v. series more than what you would find in a movie and rated accordingly."}, {"userName": "Vicki", "userReviewDate": "Feb 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8085705-vicki", "userReview": "I think I have finally found an attorney that has my sense of humor, inability to sleep, and a confusing home life.Her name is Jamie Quinn.

I am separating the first out from the three-novel compilation so I can review it, _Death by Didgeridoo_. Following are my prior notes, along with comments after reading the first book.* * * * *On Chapter 8 already. This is great! I had a good feeling about this book. It is written by an attorney, and as a former legal assistant, I know that lawyers are often good writers since so much of the work is composition. It is set in Hollywood, Florida, one of my favorite places. The murder weapon is a didgeridoo, an instrument one seldom sees or hears. I once heard one played at sunset in Sedona, Arizona!* * * * * I finished the first novel 1/4/17, and enjoyed it so much. I give it a four-star rating. It was a bit disconcerting that after the end of it, there was no title page nor introduction for the second novel, just a \"Chapter 1\" heading. Nevertheless, the characters were very likeable, particularly the main one, Jamie Quinn, and the story was fast-paced and entertaining. Some favorite quotes:\"People say it takes only ten minutes to get used to a luxury, but a lifetime to get over losing it.\"\"I [took some time to] gather my thoughts. . . Now, six months later, I am still trying to gather them, but it's no use. They are shadow puppets, gray wisps flitting through my brain, and they refuse to be caught.\"\"Because I don't sleep much, I wander the house at night like the ghost of Hamlet's father (also named Hamlet, of course), but I am much quieter about it.\"\"Since I have no choice, I'll just throw it out there and hope you don't think less of me, or make assumptions about my honesty or integrity. The truth is. . . I'm a lawyer. There, I said it. I hope that hasn't changed your opinion of me.\"\"This sounds like a made-for-TV movie.\" *Actually, this book would make a GREAT made-for-TV movie, with quirky characters and an usual murder weapon!*My thanks to the author for this introduction to her work. I am most pleased and will continue to read her books!"}, {"userName": "Luffy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy", "userReview": "Although it rarely happened that I'd come to read novellas, I've never really read any book of the same length and with similar dynamics as Death by Didgeridoo. The first thing that hit me is the brave decision by the author to make the heroine of her cozy mystery an orphan. That is a rarity. The identity of Jamie's father itself is a mystery that may or may not be solved in the next book of the series. The author wrote her book well. By that I mean 'compatible with me as a reader'. I've been betrayed by my limitation as a reader, rejecting books with promise. No such problem here. Another positive about the book here is the way in took over my mind. During the few times my attention wavered, a mental image of the subject at hand would crop up in my brain and I would focus again on the mystery. It's a reaction that rarely happens with me. This reaction immersed me in the book and made me reluctant to take a break from reading the entire book in one sitting. There are one or two advantages of writing such a relatively short book. The first is that the writer is never guilty of being long winded. This makes for some interesting side effects. E.g this book contains the most lifelike and realistic announcement of the death of a character. I'm talking about the character who dies in a car 'accident'. When I read about it, it's visceral quality hit me hard. There was not the usual artifice involved in revealing that death, and I appreciate that kind of subtlety. It immediately reminded me of learning the death of a favorite singer, who died suddenly and almost anonymously. A second advantage of a shortish story is the timing of knowing about the murderer. You can reveal the identity halfway through the book and still have that crucial momentum and build up that leads to a satisfying finale. I enjoyed reading Death by Didgeridoo and I'm thinking of reading the sequel. A well deserved 4 stars!"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/672625-susan", "userReview": "DEATH BY DIDGERIDOO is exactly what a \u201cCozy Mystery\u201d should be, crazy characters with lots of quirkiness, a little bit of humor, a little romance with no violence or very little anyway.

Duke is a hoot and I couldn't stop smiling at the silly lines he threw at Jamie! It was an enjoyable book to read. Jamie Quinn, her relatives and friends are a fun group of \u201cCozy Mystery\u201d characters and very real and believable. The murder weapon itself is odd, a Didgeridoo? What the heck is that anyway? It is an Australian wind instrument, the perfect weapon for the overall theme in this book. This story is a nice light mystery.

There is a lot of potential in this story, and selfishly I would like to read more about some of these characters.

Poor Adam thinks he actually did it so his therapist tries hypotism and that seems to work for making him feel like it wasn't his fault.In the meantime, Jamie gets Duke, a not-so-on-the-up-and-up P.I. to do some investigating for her surrounding the music teacher, Spike's, death. Spike also happens to be a rock star with several people who may have wanted to kill him. I loved how the ending and catching the perp was set up like a sting instead of having the sleuth in a lot of danger of being killed herself. I think it was a really awesome storyline of how someone with Asperger autism experiences the world. I don't personally know anyone like that but just from the writing, I can see that the author either does know someone or has done extensive research on the subject. It was just kind of cool that something that isn't usually talked about became part of a mystery.And good old Duke! I just loved that character, what a hoot! He definitely added a lot of great comedy relief to a serious case. I really like this author's writing style and will be reading and reviewing the other two in the boxed set of 1-3. I received this book as a gift and am giving an honest review of it because I really enjoyed it."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3321786-mary", "userReview": "This is a short book that is the introduction to the series. Jamie Quinn is a divorce attorney who is reeling from the death of her mother. When her aunt begs her to represent her autistic son who is a murder suspect, Jamie reluctantly takes on a case that is out of her area of expertise. She enlists the help of her friend, Grace, and a shady P.I., Duke, to help clear her cousin and find the real killer. (Oh, yes, Jamie also has a cat). The mystery wrapped up very quickly and I was surprised at the short length of this book, but it serves as a good introduction to a cast of interesting characters and lays the groundwork for the rest of the series. Jamie Quinn is a compelling young heroine who is intelligent, but knows her limitations, and is not shy about asking for help. I expect she has quite a story of her own that will play out in subsequent volumes."}, {"userName": "Els", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3645710-els", "userReview": "I do love cozy mysteries, because the murders are solved by people like you and me. But there are different kinds. Some are written in that typical style that, although the subject is serious, makes you smile. Others are more serious and not as much fun to read.This book has taken a firm place in the first category, which I certainly prefer. It had a playful vibe. The writing style was very fluent which made me finish the book in no time. Every word has its purpose in the story. There is the right amount of details.The main character remains a bit vague but what is really clear from the beginning, is that she has a heart of gold. I am sure we will get to know her in the next books.Combine the beautiful style with a lovely main character, a lack of boring details and funny bits and you end up with a little jewel.I'm off now to read the second part of the series.Thank you, Barbara! I am looking forward to some more reading pleasure."}, {"userName": "Liz", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20988058-liz", "userReview": "I found myself really really liking this book.

One morning, her aunt leaves a frantic message; her young cousin Adam, who has Asperger's Syndrome, has been arrested for murder after finding his music teacher, Spike, murdered with a didgeridoo. Although not a criminal lawyer, Jamie's family ties run deep and she dives in to save her fragile cousin from being jailed for a murder he didn't commit.Death by Didgeridoo is novella length; at only 111 pages, it's difficult to sketch out a character completely, but I thought there was real depth to the characters. I'm an insomniac, so it was easy to relate to Jamie's frustration at not being able to sleep, and it was all too easy to empathize with the loss of her mother. I like that she is self-aware enough to be able to make jokes about her grief and lack of sleep, but she deals with it with humor without becoming negative. The character of Adam, who suffers from Asperger's Syndrome, was handled realistically and sensitively, and Duke, the kinda-shady overly-flirty PI made a good sidekick for Jamie. The plot moved along quickly for such a short book, without sacrificing quality. I really liked when the public defender recommended hiring a private investigator, I thought it was a natural way to get the main character involved in the investigation. I'd have to say the only issue I had with the book is a pretty common gripe I have about mysteries; the victim is never in the book. Although I understand that in a novella length book, it would be difficult to shoehorn in a few scenes showing what a miserable a-hole the victim was, but without having \"met\" him, I didn't connect with his murder. Actually, now that I think about it, both victims were only mentioned in the book, but were not really a part of it. A minor issue, and as I said, very common but it would be nice to get a feel for the victims to give their murders more of an impact.Overall a great start to a new series, and recommended for any cozy mystery lover. Note: The author provided a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. (She somehow knew I was a big fan of didgeridoos. It was fate)"}, {"userName": "Star", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/304219-star", "userReview": "Jamie Quinn, a family law attorney, has already had a rough year after losing her mother to cancer. When she receives a frantic voicemail from her Aunt Peg saying her cousin Adam has been arrested, she heads down first thing to the police station. Adam suffers from Asperger syndrome, non-violent and musically inclined, but he feels guilty about something. Jamie finds out Adam is accused of murdering his music teacher Spike. Fortunately for Adam, Spike is not a well liked man and there was many a celebration when the news of his passing makes the rounds. Now Jamie needs all the help she can get to prove Adam\u2019s innocence since the district attorney is determined to see Adam go to prison for a long time. DEATH BY DIDGERIDOO is a short novel, the first of the Jamie Quinn mystery series. The book has solid writing and the author has the talent to go far as a fiction writer, but the characters will need to develop more in future books to keep readers\u2019 interest in this series. I enjoyed the mystery, but it seemed a bit \u2018easy\u2019 for Jamie and her friends to figure out the truth. DEATH BY DIDGERIDOO will appeal to readers who prefer \u2018softer\u2019 mysteries and will whet appetites for the next Jamie Quinn mystery."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33014845-jonathan", "userReview": "*I was contacted and asked by the author to write this review. All thoughts and opinions stated in this review are entirely my own.*Most Indie books are hit and moss for me. There\u2019s some simply amazing ones, and there\u2019s some horrible ones; they\u2019re just like every other type of book. However, this book was one of those hits. It was slightly rushed, but for it\u2019s length there was nothing that could be done about it.The characters were great. I loved Jamie and especially Duke. He was hilarious! I also loved Adam. In most cozy books 95% of the people are the same old same old. The MC has red, unseemly hair, her mom is overbearing, her dad is slightly detached, and her siblings seem to be so much more put together than the MC. However, I absolutely love it when authors deviate from that mold, like the author did in this book.The mystery was well put together, there was no real reveal and it seems slightly rushed, however this book was short and in many shorter books the mystery feels rushed. Honestly, I don\u2019t think there was anything the author could have done to prevent that.Overall a solid first book.
