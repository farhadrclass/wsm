{"ratings": 3410, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Nov 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "3 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum http://bibliosanctum.com/2016/01/03/y...2015 was a great year for YA fiction, with lots of new ideas and debut authors breaking onto the scene. When S. Harrison\u2019s Infinity Lost popped up on my radar late in the fall, I thought it sounded like an interesting book to check out.The story takes place in the near future, following the life of a girl named Infinity \u201cFinn\u201d Blackstone. Her father, CEO of Blackstone Technologies, is one of the richest and most powerful men in the world, but while his company\u2019s world-changing services and products are nearly ubiquitous, Richard Blackstone himself remains a highly reclusive figure. Not even Finn has ever met him. Raised by her father\u2019s staff, all she knows about the man is what others have told her and what she sees on the news.Finn is seventeen when she and her classmates from boarding school are taken on a field trip to visit the Blackstone headquarters. Elated, Finn believes this could finally be her chance to meet her father and confront him with all her questions. Lately, she has been having strange dreams, even though a part of her knows they are more than that. The visions feel like memories, but how can that be when she cannot remember actually experiencing them herself? Finn is determined to find some answers, and she believes Richard Blackstone is the key.Beyond that, I really can\u2019t say more; suffice to say, the plot takes a surprising number of turns and ends up in a place I never saw coming, and if I give away anything else I would be hovering dangerously close to spoiler territory. What I can say is that Infinity Lost was a really quick read due to its relatively modest page count, which along with being jam-packed with action and tight storytelling made this one a really fast-pace and entertaining read. I also thoroughly enjoyed the future setting which featured some innovative tech, some of which were pretty farfetched but nonetheless very cool. The book also stood out to me because of its departure from certain YA norms, such as downplaying any romance (at least in this first book) though quite honestly, the plot moves along so quickly that there\u2019s hardly any room for unnecessary drama.That said, while a lot of things in Infinity Lost worked for me, there were a few issues that tripped me up as well. First, you should know that technically, the \u201creal story\u201d doesn\u2019t start until late in the novel, because the first half contains almost nothing but random and sometimes confusing flashbacks. Finn has these dream-memories, and the time jumps can get very jarring and tiresome after a while. Second, I\u2019m a bit disappointed that we didn\u2019t get to see more of the wider world, though this is mainly due to the limitations of looking through Finn\u2019s eyes in the first-person. She\u2019s being kept in the dark, and so by extension, we are as well.Third\u2014though this is not a problem for me personally, I still figured I should mention it\u2014reading this book was a little like watching a movie that starts off PG-13, but then ends with a full-blown R rating. The final chapters are a veritable bloodbath, with heads popping off, bodies being blown into red mist, etc. all brutally described in vivid and graphic detail. I\u2019ve read a lot worse of course, but I was still shocked at the lack of warning; the beginning held absolutely no clue that this book would end in such over-the-top, indiscriminate violence. If that kind of content turns you off, I would approach this with caution.But my biggest issue was the cliffhanger. In this day and age of seemingly nothing but YA trilogies and series, I grudgingly accept the need for them, but at the very least I think each book should still contain the resolution to its main conflict. I don\u2019t like it when a book ends abruptly in the middle of a scene; it\u2019s clumsy and awkward and I end up with more questions than answers, which is not a good feeling. Unfortunately, this was the case here. There were too many loose ends, and the book did not in any way feel complete.Even in the face of all these issues though, I liked the book well enough that I would be open to continuing the series, if nothing else to find out what happens to Finn. Infinity Lost felt very much like a long intro, and I feel confident that the meat of the story will be in the sequel Infinity Rises, out January 5, 2016."}, {"userName": "Joy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22660848-joy", "userReview": "Infinity is REALLY lost!

Things get suuuper bloody toward the end, which makes this a book I would actually cringe to give a teenager but a fine read for us old fogies that still read YA. Lots of readers complained about the split timeline/flashback narrative, but I think it was actually a strength of the book. At no time did I have any trouble following the action, nor did I ever get confused as to which timeline I was currently reading. The biggest weakness, IMO, was the worldbuilding. The opening is a clunky infodump with a premise that is too weak even for YA readers. I would have forgiven that eventually, except then the author repeated most of that info again later in two more repetitive infodumps that didn't add anything further to the weak foundation. Worse, not a lot of work was put into describing the universe as a whole. It wasn't even until three quarters through the book that I even determined what continent we were in. Just because the protagonist leads a relatively sheltered life doesn't mean she would be ignorant of basic facts about the world around her. Moreover, half the fun of dystopian fiction is determining how the fictional universe went off the rails--and what that says about the real world. With so little work put into showing the reader this fairly basic building block of the genre, I feel a smidge cheated. Where's my scathing social commentary masquerading as a silly sci-fi shoot em up?I waffled between three and four stars. I finally rounded up because I thought it was being unfairly skewered in reviews. I think a lot of people, myself included, got this book free from an Amazon promotion. The problem with giving away a book free to such a wide audience, though, is that people end up reading it who never, ever should have. So if you don't like YA, sci-fi, M. Night Shyamalan-style plot twists, or gratuitous violence, this book is not for you."}, {"userName": "Chelle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25329088-chelle", "userReview": "This book had so much potential but fell painfully flat. It was boring. It was predictable. Worst of all, it was full of really cheesy stereotypes. The bitchy blonde popular girl. The two bumbling idiot jocks. The quiet genius computer hacker.

Also, in a world where people have their perfectly-functioning organs replaced with super-efficient bionic ones at the age of 30, why are there still girls having asthma attacks? I can't figure that one out. Some of the writing was actually cringe-worthy. What self-respecting, high-ranking military colonel would ever say something like \"What a crock. We'll find you, mister computer hacker.\" Really? No, really. Don't even get me started on the completely gratuitous violence. It seems as if the author is being overly disgusting just for the sake of being disgusting.

The CEO of Blackstone technologies--kind of Facebook/Apple/Google/Raytheon all in one. Infinity has apparently NEVER met her father has been raised by a kind but gruff former soldier/bodyguard and a cruel nanny. Infinity seems strangely OK with this (which is a little odd to accept as an opening premise but whatever). Things start to go sideways when we hear snippets of conversations about the danger Infinity poses to the world. As time goes on, Infinity learns more about herself and why so many people seem to fear her. It's not a BAD plot, per se. But the story jumps around WAY too much. We get climactic battle scenes early in the book with a teenaged Infinity followed by a high school field trip and then back to being a precocious six year old. While there's ostensibly a \"reason\" behind these jump-arounds (many are presented as vivid dreams), it's quite difficult to track which is the actual present POV timeline and what knowledge THAT iteration of the character actually posseses.It's also a very short book so the plot elements come at you fast and often without a lot of buildup or explanation.

I woke up, didn't even get out of bed, chose a book from one of the many unread ones living in my kindle, and read the whole thing that day. Granted, it's not a terribly long book, but it's not often I do that anymore. In this book, most everything is made and owned by one company. They make the best phone, computers, search engine, etc. The main character is the daughter of the reclusive man who owns and invented everything. For the first years of her life, she was home schooled and locked away on his estate, but now she goes to a boarding school where no one knows who she is, except her roomie/best friend, who happens to be the daughter of the other company. One day, the best students get to go on a field trip and be the first school to see inside the company's factory complex, which is akin to a tour by Willy Wonka. Only the thing is, this girl doesn't even know her dad. He's always hired other people to take care of her. And throughout, we flash back and forth from her childhood to now, and it seems almost like they're too different people.

Such as:\u2013 What is Finn? Genetically- or technologically-modified human? Android? Clone?\u2013 For what purpose was she created/modified?\u2013 Is her father really her father or just her creator? Is he human? Does he even really exist?\u2013 Is she ever going to meet him? Why has she never met him yet?\u2013 Why does the crazy lady want her dead?\u2013 Is her childhood friend really dead?The big problem here is that none of these questions are answered, not even the one about the villain\u2019s motivation. I know that, as the first book in a series, it\u2019s not necessary that this book answer all the questions it raises, but it really should provide some answers.The plot of this book doesn\u2019t feel like a complete story. In fact, I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s not. Here\u2019s my own summation of what happens in this book: Finn finds out her class field trip has been changed at the last minute to go to her father\u2019s company rather than wherever it was going before. It\u2019s strongly hinted that this is because of interference from her hacker best friend. They go on the field trip. They see a bunch of \u201ccool\u201d stuff (really, it\u2019s pretty over-the-top). All hell breaks loose and lots of people die, but Finn mostly just watches all that happen on a video screen from a room in another part of the facility. She has a brief fight scene with the villain. Cliffhanger non-ending. Interspersed through the first half or so of the book are Finn\u2019s dreams/memories showing some stuff from her life growing up.It starts out strangely, with Finn floating in nothingness which morphs into a dream, but it\u2019s really a memory. These memory-dreams keep coming back through the whole story, revealing her backstory to us (and to her, as she was previously unaware of many of the things she experiences in these memories). One problem with this is that it means Finn is constantly falling asleep, getting knocked out, fainting or otherwise becoming unconscious. Which makes her seem a bit narcoleptic. I mean, think about reading a book about a narcoleptic character, where the narcolepsy isn\u2019t really a major part of the plot. It\u2019s kind of weird. Also, aside from naturally falling asleep, it seems like that kind of thing happening that frequently could not be healthy for one\u2019s brain.Anyway, the memory scenes are actually some of the more exciting parts of the book. For a very large portion of the story, the present day stuff is kinda dull. The entire present day plot is pretty much that her school class takes a field trip to a technology company and it all goes horribly wrong. To me, that\u2019s just not enough plot for an entire novel. The constant interruption of the present day plot by the memories was a bit jarring and kind of prevented me from investing fully in the plot.One specific thing that didn\u2019t make sense, plot-wise, was that the field trip was evidently the result of Finn\u2019s friend Bit hacking the Blackstone system. Considering the tour guide later says that he was surprised to see the tour on his schedule, that it was only the fourth tour ever given, and that it was the first for students, I have a really hard time believing the tour guide would not check this oddity with his superiors. And, if they were going to give a tour, considering the top-secret nature of the facilities, I\u2019d expect them to want to know the identities of everyone attending prior to their arrival. And in doing so, I\u2019d expect them to know that one of the students (Bit) is the daughter of the owner of Blackstone\u2019s biggest competitor and therefore, recording devices or not, would be extremely unlikely to show her (at least) their secrets. So \u2026 yeah, basically I found the whole setup of what goes on in the present day part to be unbelievable.Tone-wise, most of the book goes along like a pretty typical YA sci-fi. There\u2019s a normal girl with a best friend doing a fairly normal thing (field trip). As it goes on, we find out that there\u2019s more to her past than it seemed, and she is just now becoming aware that some weird stuff is going on with her. There\u2019s some romantic interest, but not a huge amount. Then, bam, all of a sudden it\u2019s a gory horror flick with people running and screaming and getting splattered by gunfire and skulls being sliced off.The book feels very short, mostly because of the split attention and the paltry plot of the present day parts of the book. When the book ends, it really feels like it should be the end of act one of the book. So I think, if the next two books end up the same way, it will probably turn out that this story would have been better off edited down a bit and released as one long book rather than three short ones.Oh, yes, one other thing. Even though I like Finn and I think she has good potential as a protagonist, the fact is that (aside from the memory scenes) she really doesn\u2019t ever do anything to drive the story forward. Well, maybe once, when she freaks out and tries to get the heck out of there and falls and knocks herself out and then gets marched into field trip detention. Which \u2026 doesn\u2019t actually move the plot forward at all. Pretty much, stuff happens to her and she freaks out (as one probably would), but she never really makes decisions or takes action. This will probably change in later books, I assume, but in this one she just didn\u2019t really do much.So, my opinion is that the book was not very well plotted or paced. It annoyed me that it ends on a cliffhanger without any kind of resolution or any questions answered. And I feel a little cheated that the book I was expecting, about a girl who is going to meet her father for the first time to get answers about what\u2019s happening to her, is not the book I got. The whole \u201cher father\u2019s the richest, most powerful man in the world, and she\u2019s never met him\u201d thing is really a tiny, tiny part of this book, and there\u2019s no payoff (she never meets him, and there\u2019s never any indication that he\u2019s even there when they\u2019re on their field trip to his company).And yet, I do still want to know the answers to those questions. Maybe I\u2019ll read the next books, but they\u2019re not an absolute necessity for me.

If there was more of a plot, I think I would have enjoyed the story yet, even after reading it, I'm not even too sure what her father exactly does alongside what society they were in.It was a real shame."}, {"userName": "Christine Bishop", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55735209-christine-bishop", "userReview": "Loved This Book!The book is told from Finn POV and jumps from present to past. She has strange dreams about her past. A past that she doesn't exactly remember the way she dreams it. She is the daughter of the owner of Blackstone technology, but she's only met her father one time in the middle of the night. She's been raised by nannies, guards, cooks, and maids. But everything amd everyone in her life are not how they seem. I loved reading this book. I read it straight through in one day and I'm about to start on Infinity Rises."}, {"userName": "David Allison", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45912506-david-allison", "userReview": "This book, and I use the term rather loosely, is roughly 20% plot, and 80% filler. From the scene where a group of men effectively molest an 8 year old girl, to the attempt to illustrate a teenage girls lustful desires towards a boy (hint: it's ALL about the abs!); this collection of random words thrown together in a semi-coherent order is amongst one of the worst things I've ever read, and I've read Supernatural Wincest fan fiction on Tumblr. However, it only cost \u00a31 hence the 2nd star."}, {"userName": "Carly Kirk", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13567923-carly-kirk", "userReview": "Oh my holy cow! Talk about an amazing book! This is just an awesome wild ride! At the beginning I wasn't sure I'd like it because it really felt like the Finn was overlooking quite a bit of what was going on around her (and within her) but those feelings quickly gave way to the exceptional story being told. And once things heat up action wise they really heat up. I can't wait to dive into the 2nd book!"}, {"userName": "Katie Berryman", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31905244-katie-berryman", "userReview": "Really good read. It was interesting the entire time and kept my attention. I very frequently looked at my kindle longingly wanting to just stop what I was doing to continue to read the book. I was a bit startled at the abrupt ending, but because the book flowed so well and was such an easy read, I will definitely be continuing on into the next book in the series."}, {"userName": "Brittney Garrison", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34057537-brittney-garrison", "userReview": "I really wanted to enjoy this book, but that didn't go quite as planned. Also, I'd like to mention that in the first few chapters six-year-old Finn is molested by a roomful of men. This scene made me highly uncomfortable, and I wanted to warn others that this could be a trigger.
