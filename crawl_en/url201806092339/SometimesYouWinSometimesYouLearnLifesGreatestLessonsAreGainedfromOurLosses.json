I was dealing with a difficult work situation and getting very angry and reading this book helped put it all into perspective. Life isnt easy but it can be better and more fulfilling if you look at negatives as a way to learn and grow. It is all about perspective and looking forwards to self improvement. From the opening beautiful into by the late John Wooden through the amazingly inspirational quotes sprinkled throughout, John C. Maxwell does a wonderful job of laying out the case for learning and growing through failures and disappointments. I really loved how the book was set-up with each section being specific to one of his eleven elements that make up people who learn from mistakes:1. Humility - The Spirit of Learning2. Reality - The Foundation of Learning3. Responsibility - The First Step of Learning4. Improvement - The Focus of Learning5. Hope - The Motivation of Learning6. Teachability - The Pathway of Learning7. Adversity - The Catalyst of Learning8. Problems - The Opportunities of Learning9. Bad Experiences - The Perspective for Learning10. Change - The Price of Learning11. Maturity - The Value of LearningOne of the most important takeaways is the need for personal accountability which is a trait that is sorely lacking from American society. I truly feel like I have a better handle on how to tackle change, problems and failures thanks to this book, and I know that I will be re-reading this often. I also plan on purchasing at least one copy for the office as well as for my coworkers, this is an important book especially during turbulent times. http://anovelnosh.com/book-review-som..."}, {"userName": "Laura Thompson", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29945462-laura-thompson", "userReview": "While there were some great nuggets in this book, there is nothing new or original.

At times I was like hey did this dude sit down at my last training for work and takes notes cause the stuff he was presenting in this book is super similar. Add to that that he relies a lot on quotes from others (who often say his point better than he does) and it's like right all of this has been said before. Not to give him no credit at times the information is presented in an interesting way. And there are some useful things in here. But overall this is nothing new. He tells a lot of stories which really up the page count. And didn't always feel necessary.Further, this dude glorifies adversity and yet seems super disconnected from what others experience. He points out that some folks would say that \"it's more difficult for people who are underprivileged, facing adversity, or suffering pain\", but he doesn't think so. And you are like, but it would be more difficult. I used to work 70 hours a week. Commuting 1.5 hours to work. I had no time to even think. I was tired all the time and it would have been super difficult to meet his guidelines for being teachable. It's shows his privilege in him assuming that folks have time for this stuff. He talks a big game about adversity, but his examples of his struggles just don't click. You spent 20k to have a passport delivered to you? Cool thats about what I make in a year. You lost a million dollars in a bad decision you made and you couldn't really afford to lose so much money and had to sell some of your investments? I've never had a million dollars to invest. I won't say losing your mother isn't a struggle, but you had her for 62 years of your life. You are an adult and thats a lot of love you got to receive. And it is part of life that parents die. I just see a lot of privilege, a lot of wealth and a disconnect from the lives that others lead in this book. He brings up depression in passing, but doesn't really address how a depressed person might be able to utilize his advice (just that they lack energy because they have no hope). Overall, he came off as someone who isn't presenting anything really new, he rehashed his own ideas multiple times throughout the book and he seems disconnected from others experiences. It just wasn't what I had hoped to read."}, {"userName": "Taiba Physics", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45257947-taiba-physics", "userReview": "It's one of the best books I've ever read.
