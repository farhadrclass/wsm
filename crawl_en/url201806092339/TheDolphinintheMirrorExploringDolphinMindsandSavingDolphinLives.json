The book is really not bad for a popular science title. It's a survey of biologist Diana Reiss's thirty years of research into the spectacularly inquisitive minds of bottlenose dolphins. She let's go emotionally here in a way that she can't in her scientific papers, and the anecdotes are fascinating. I especially liked the brief history of dolphin-human interactions from antiquity to the present day. Brief astonishing online videos augment the text. The prose is unexceptional but it's the conservation argument the world desperately needs to hear: STOP THE SEASONAL BOTTLENOSE DOLPHIN SLAUGHTERS AT TAIJI AND FUTO JAPAN.

When a dolphin looks in a mirror, does it know it is looking at itself? Dolphin expert Diana Reiss says yes, and her colleagues agree. Reiss has spent 30 years studying dolphins and getting to know them as intimately as one can hope to know a marine mammal species. Central to her research were experiments to determine if a dolphin could recognize itself as itself in a mirror, rather than thinking it is seeing another dolphin. Mirror self-recognition is considered a sign of extremely high intelligence, and was previously believed possible only in humans and higher primates such as chimpanzees. Dolphins have now been added to that elite category. Once a dolphin figures out that the image in the mirror is himself, he will explore his body, gazing into his own eyes, checking out his teeth, and displaying various body parts for self-inspection. If a researcher makes a mark on a dolphin's body, the dolphin will quickly swim to the mirror and orient himself so as to look at the mark. This \"mark test\" was first used on primates and is considered the definitive proof of mirror self-recognition. The self-recognition findings are the pinnacle of Reiss's work, but there's much more to the book. She discusses dolphin myths in various cultures and the centuries-long history of man's fascination with dolphins. She also outlines some of her other dolphin intelligence studies, including an underwater keyboard dolphins could use to select a specific toy or other reward. The stories of dolphin antics during the various experiments were my favorite parts of the book. The author is careful not to ascribe human traits to these animals, but it seems to me they have quite a sense of humor. They're also prone to behaviors strongly resembling empathy and service. Near the end of the book, Reiss slips out of her role as scientist and into that of activist. She describes the brutal slaughter techniques used on dolphins in Taiji, Japan. These practices were the subject of the 2009 film \"The Cove,\" which won an Academy Award for Best Documentary Film. These dolphins are the victims of several methods of slow, painful death, including something resembling a torture rack. The Japanese government has refused to ban these inhumane practices, but Diana Reiss is not giving up.Reiss writes with a style that is easy for anyone to understand. She maintains scientific integrity while avoiding pretentiousness or oversimplification. The organizational structure of the book seems a little odd at times, but it's not a major drawback. The stories of the antics and exploits of the dolphins Reiss worked with over the years made me laugh out loud, and sometimes laugh and cry at the same time. I would have liked to see even more of these stories, and perhaps a little less of the history of research done on species other than dolphins."}, {"userName": "Alan", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4131838-alan", "userReview": "As much as I wanted to like this book it didn't click for me. If you are interested in questions like what it means to be self-aware or related questions then you should enjoy this book. In it Reiss spends too many pages detailing how she did different experiments designed to discover if dolphins are self-aware. Reiss then spends too many more pages reflecting on her conclusions and on her emotional bonds to her subjects. I imagine that it would be virtually impossible not to develop emotional and deeply sentimental connections with dolphins if you worked with them every day. The risk of having those kinds of emotional connections and trying to do objective, empirical research, however, is that it becomes increasingly difficult to minimize bias in that kind of setting. You see, if you love dolphins and you have a pre-existing bias that they are intelligent, there is a very real risk that when they do something it will be interpreted as intelligence. Am I saying that dolphins are not intelligent? No. What I'm saying is that what Reiss did was extremely difficult...to manage to separate bias and observation enough to do some good science. Reiss also gets into the topic of marine mammal protection, not using conservation as the argument, but that humans have a moral obligation to protect other species that show evidence of self-awareness and intelligence. That's an interesting idea, but, sadly, that argument has not yet shown an ability to sway nations like Japan that continue to harvest wild dolphins for marine mammal parks, shows, etc., and also butcher the rest for sale as food. For more on this particular situation you should watch the documentary, The Cove. The heavy dose of sentimentality and writing that is not really engaging (for me) leads me to award 3 stars for this book."}, {"userName": "Brittany", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/92397-brittany", "userReview": "I started reading this book in the gift shop at the National Aquarium in Baltimore (where Reiss works with the dolphins) and was so enthralled that I requested it from the library as soon as I got home.The book starts out with the story of Reiss and others helping rescue a humpback whale that had swum far too far up San Francisco's river system. It was a compelling story, but there was a characterization of a government employee that was so villainous he all but twirled his mustaches. I'm sure he was unhelpful and difficult, but I find it hard to believe he was as flatly evil as she presents him; he comes off like the bad guy in a Disney movie. This made me cautious about the rest of the book. I had higher hopes for this book than I did for Silent Thunder: In the Presence of Elephants. However, for the most part those concerns were unfounded. Either that, or they were just completely outshone by the dolphin stories. After the first few chapters, Reiss steps to the background and lets the dolphins themselves shine through. The dolphin stories were dazzling. Reiss tells the story of the steps she took into exploring and quantifying dolphin cognition. Her papers, and the stories that make it into the newspaper, are engaging enough. But what was truly astonishing were the stories that didn't make it into the academic papers because they were anecdotal and singular. Those are very good reasons not to attempt to include them in public papers, but they're breathtaking and well worth reading. This is one of those books where you keep interrupting your friends to read them the amazing paragraph you just read. The story of the science is almost as fascinating as the story of the dolphins themselves, as Reiss has fought for her studies to be recognized as the solid science they are, and not as wishful thinking. She gives a very clear-eyed look at why this is, and offers some insights into the origin of the problem (a lot of it she attributes to the more enthusiastic excesses of John C. Lilly) and how we must solve it. I knew Reiss was involved in the National Aquarium and had worked with dolphins at the New York Aquarium. I did not realize she was a driving force between the documentary The Cove. Her efforts to stop the slaughter at Taiji are a heartrending peek into the world of international conservation efforts.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in animal cognition, or anyone who just loves cool animal stories.

I will admit that this book started a bit slow with all of the myths and personal experiences thrown in, but once she got to her work with the dolphins in question, I was riveted by her reporting and interaction with her mentor creatures and the results/findings stemming thereof.Slow start aside, this book is pivotal in terms of learning not only about dolphins and their evolution, but our own. This cannot be stated enough. Just because this book is non-fiction shouldn\u2019t put that off. The way Reiss writes makes even the most stern scientific fact inviting in a near-fictional way, and makes her adventures with her dolphins a surreal, almost magical life experience. It didn\u2019t read like non-fiction at all.What makes this even easier for even the most ignorant reader to understand is her multiple footnotes that made things even clearer if she felt that her language/jargon would cause even the slightest bit of doubt. While I know enough to understand basic biology-related papers, it really helped when she put in these footnotes. Not many scientists presenting their research in a book to the public that\u2019s not in their field do this, and this impressed me all the more. I applaud her for making her work accessible to people of all walks of life.Even if you\u2019re into whale hunting and are against films like \u201cthe Cove\u201d, this really needs reading (all the more). Dolphins, according to Reiss\u2019 research, have not only a sense of individual self, but also have a sense of who isn\u2019t a dolphin when interacting with others. I\u2019m definitely not one of those militant PETA-types when it comes to animal rights, but I also know when an animal can feel and think on a level that might remotely be human. I urge everyone to give this book a try and be surprised by some of the most beautiful (and endangered) creatures on earth. It\u2019ll make you wonder who\u2019s the superior species once you\u2019re done. One of the best of 2011 in the non-fiction catagory, for sure.(crossposted to shelfari, librarything, and witchoftheatregoing.wordpress.com)"}, {"userName": "Colin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1086357-colin", "userReview": "I was a little nervous that this would turn out to be touchy-feely rather than a look at the minds of dolphins but it turned out ok. The goal of the book is to introduce readers to the complexities of these intelligent creatures, and it does that fairly well. In that respect this book is fairly focused on Dr. Reiss' research. It does not really go much into behavior, neuroscience biology etc., instead sticking to language and theory of mind. She does a good job of that and while I'd love to know more about the other aspects of dolphins, this was a nice introduction and review of what Reiss and other researchers have found out about their minds (note - not their brains). In the end, the book turns strongly to advocacy for dolphin conservation and consideration. It's no real surprise as she is open enough with her feelings from the get go to clue anyone in. This section could put off some readers even if they agree with the message - evangelism is often just plain tiresome - but the story she tells is actually interesting and informative.The book is occasionally an annoying read as Reiss' voice is a bit to self aware, with constant qualifications of what she can say as a scientist, what she feels on a personal level and often distracting descriptions of actions (such as describing how at one point she was so happy she pumped her fist in the air - which she then admits is a young person's action) or even quotes from old conversations. While the occasional foray into such details can help elevate a story by letting the reader enter into the thoughts and experiences of the writer in a comfortably intimate way, in this book, they tended to pull me out of the flow rather than pull me deeper in.Reiss has dedicated her life to understanding dolphins and her love for them shines through. While the writing can be annoying, this is a good book for anyone interested in dolphins, intelligence and the self-awareness of other species."}, {"userName": "M.L.

Throughout the book Diana Reiss lovingly describes, with a strong commitment to scientific endeavour, her research in dolphin behaviour. There are several instances that should make all of us look upon these animals with wonder and respect and give in to that gut-feeling that we are not so unique after all. I felt, however, that the author's support of the captivity industry (aquaria and popular scientific institutions) was a little in contrast with her activism against the Taiji slaughter. I wouldn't go as far as accusing the author of some form of cognitive dissonance but, I've wondered throughout the book how could she believe that the creatures she worked were fundamentally at peace with their own state of being, as captive souls in de-natured settings.

As a biologist, I had a great interest in reading The Dolphin in the Mirror.

This time, I decided to read about dolphins. I'm quite glad that I did, as I learned though this book that they are at least equal to, and possibly smarter than, chimps in intelligence.Diana Reiss certainly has the credentials to write a book about dolphin intelligence. She is a professor of psychology at Hunter University as well as a professor in the graduate program of Biopsychology and Behavioral Neuroscience of the City University of New York. Her work has focused on understanding cognition and communication in dolphins. She also served as the scientific advisor for the excellent documentary about dolphin drive hunts in Japan, The Cove. This novel chronicles her work with dolphins and speaks out against the cruelty going on in Taiji, where thousands of dolphins are inhumanely slaughtered each year. I learned a lot of things about dolphins that I didn't know before. The anecdotes about dolphins coming to the rescue of humans in trouble at sea were very interesting, as were the stories of unique behaviors Reiss witnessed during her work at various aquariums. I found myself smiling a laughing several times as I read about the dolphins' playful antics. The most interesting part of the novel, in my opinion, was the story of how Reiss performed a mirror recognition test with dolphins (this is where the title \"Dolphin the Mirror\" comes from). If an animal can recognize their own image in a mirror, it shows a high degree of intelligence. Most animals see their image in a mirror and think that it's another animal. Very few species have the brains to recognize that the image they are looking at is a reflection of themselves. Humans can pass this test of course. So can chimps, gorillas and elephants. Reiss eventually is able to prove that dolphins recognize themselves too, although she had many difficulties in proving it. It's hard for people to see just how smart dolphins are because their bodies are so different from ours. It was interesting to read about the struggles Reiss had to go through to prove dolphins do recognize themselves.There were some aspects of this book that I wasn't a fan of. There was a lot of existential musings present throughout the book. There are a few entire chapters devoted to pondering lofty questions about man's place in the universe in relation to other animals. During these sections I just wanted to hurry up and get back to the dolphin stuff again. The chapters were either hit or miss with me. I was more interested in learning about dolphins than philosophy. I understand that Reiss wanted to present a worldview that showed man sharing the world with other animals and being considerate of the different intelligences present in the animal kingdom, but I think that her scientific facts about dolphins spoke louder than her repetitive psychological ponderings.All in all, this was an interesting read. It opened my eyes to the intelligence of dolphins and made me interesting in learning more.

Heartbreaking to read how, in order to be taken seriously by the scientific community (though she didn't frame it this way), she repeatedly has to ignore honest attempts to communicate from her test subjects. For example, she creates a touch screen for the dolphins, giving them the option of asking for a rub, toy or fish. When the dolphins ask for fish too often, they remove it from the board. Her test subject tries to use a blank spot on the board to try to elicit fish production, to no avail. Her test subject then finds a bit of fish in the pool, brings it to her, makes eye contact, and she has to ignore this obvious request. For science. Not part of the study, you see. GAH! If you meet a blue man on Mars and want to converse with him, in no way would you consider his successful parroting of statements you wished him to say or actions you wished him to perform as evidence of language acquisition or consciousness. No, for those, you'd need actual dialogue. And our science doesn't allow for that---even by the wonderful, sensitive Diana Reiss. GAH! Fascinating to read about Lou Herman's studies with visual image and sonar pattern pairing. If a dolphin can find a 3 inch sphere at a distance of 400 meters with its sonar, I can see how hard it is to try to devise experiments to try to dialogue with our crappy sonar, but I am more convinced than ever that it is necessary to try.

I did have my husband read it through first to make sure that there weren't too many emotional stories about dolphin mistreatment. If you are sensitive to these types of animal stories, I recommend that you skip the chapter titled the Cove as I did.

I would give it five stars if it was just a touch better written, but I guess you can't ask for a brilliant research biologist and gripping author all in one (I'm neither)."}, {"userName": "Dana", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/310429-dana", "userReview": "3.5 stars***This was a very accessible science book. The author tells how she ended up studying animal consciousness. It is consciousness even more than intelligence and she makes great and easily understood arguments for why this is. Her use of language and storytelling is very compelling and you feel like you are there with her as she makes each discovery. The last two chapters have a very different feel. I understand why they are there and what she is trying to do, but somehow it ends up being discordant with the rest of the book."}, {"userName": "Keygan", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25321426-keygan", "userReview": "Amazing. Beautifully written and inspiring. A perfect mix of fact, anecdote, and emotional appeal which makes a powerful case for dolphin cognitive capability and also to end dolphin drive hunts. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes animals, nature, science, and especially dolphins. There were also some lovely philosophical musings on our own place in the world and our connection to nature, animals, and other intelligent beings."}, {"userName": "Anastasia", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/412789-anastasia", "userReview": "I mostly enjoyed this book. The author provided a rare (for me) look at the latest scientific knowledge and gut reactions about the intelligence of dolphins. What I didn't enjoy were the almost unrelenting sexist language (and this from an author who seemed to have a feminist awareness) and the random organization of the chapters. It made me want to read a similar type of book about gorillas and elephants (any suggestions?)."}], "description": "A memoir by the world\u2019s leading dolphin and whale expert, revealing the extraordinary richness of these animals\u2019 intelligence and exposing our terrible mistreatment of the smartest creatures in the sea.For centuries, humans and dolphins have enjoyed a special relationship, evident not just in mythology and folklore but in many documented encounters. Some past cultures even worshipped dolphins and condemned anyone who killed or wounded of them. Yet in recent decades, a paradox: on the one hand, we have discovered extraordinary depths of dolphin intelligence and their emotional lives, to the point of glimpsing their self-consciousness\u2014on the other hand, in Japan, dolphins are slaughtered indiscriminately, and several nations keep them in cruel conditions.Diana Reiss is one of the world\u2019s leading experts on dolphin intelligence who has helped lead the revolution in dolphin understanding for three decades. In addition, as an activist, she is a leading rescuer who helped inspire and served as an adviser for The Cove, and who continues to campaign against the annual Japanese slaughters. Here, she combines her science and activism to show us just how smart dolphins really are, and why we must stop mistreating them. Readers will be astonished at dolphins\u2019 sonar capabilities; at their sophisticated, lifelong playfulness; at their emotional intelligence; and at their ability to bond with other species, including humans and even dogs! Her beloved companion dolphins, each with distinct personalities, create their own toys, type commands on a keyboard, tease and scold her playfully, and express their affection and delight. In Reiss\u2019s most famous experiments, she used a mirror to prove that dolphins are self-aware, and even self-conscious. The Dolphin in the Mirror is both a scientific revelation and a emotional eye-opener, revealing one of the greatest intelligences on Earth.", "title": "The Dolphin in the Mirror: Exploring Dolphin Minds and Saving Dolphin Lives", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10874668-the-dolphin-in-the-mirror", "average": 4.09, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1302711727l/10874668.jpg", "reviews": 38, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/1165437.Diana_Reiss", "name": "Diana Reiss"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Animals", "Science", "Environment", "Science"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10874668-the-dolphin-in-the-mirror", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13429652-the-dolphin-in-the-mirror", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12679159-the-dolphin-in-the-mirror", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2647720-the-secrets-of-the-dolphins", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13593701-in-the-herd", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205082-everything-is-horrible-and-wonderful", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
