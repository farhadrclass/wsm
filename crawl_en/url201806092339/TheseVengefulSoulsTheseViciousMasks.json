I really wish this hadn\u2019t been just a run away vs. revenge plot, and I really wish we hadn\u2019t thrown in a million new characters who took away from getting to know some of the original cast better. And I really really wish there had been more romance and tension between Sebastian and Evelyn. There were such great humorous and heartwarming scenes between the two in the previous books and I feel that there were only maybe two short ones in this finale.However, there were several moments that had me laughing out loud.

Even though I wasn't as pleased with this novel, this is still one of my most favorite series. It does everything brilliantly from fantastic characters, witty and ridiculously entertaining writing, and more. I think this book just suffered a bit from a couple of different things, but it still brought so many smiles to my face and still something I couldn't put down.The first thing that always gets me about these novels is the writing. I don't know how Shanker and Zekas do it, but they do it so seamlessly and brilliantly. It's fun, witty, and so easy to read. You're never confused, you're always entertained, and there's never anything in the novel that doesn't need to be in there. I will forever be reading anything by these two authors - whether it's them being their dynamic duo selves or them going solo. They actually make me laugh out loud, which is so very rare to do.Mr. Kent was just absolutely brilliant in this novel as well. He will forever go down as one of my favorite characters ever. He's right up there with my absolute love, Carswell Thorne. He is honestly everything that Oscar Wilde would ever want with a character, and CAN SOMEONE JUST GIVE HIM HIS OWN BOOK SO I CAN CRY AND FANGIRL OVER HIM FOR ETERNITY? pleaseeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee. I felt some of the other characters were a bit contrasting for me in this one. Evelyn has been one of my favorite heroines that I've ever read, but I felt like she was so consumed in this novel about revenge and murder that I lost a lot of the characteristics that I loved about her. She seemed so unlike the girl that I had read about in the prior two books, and she acted so rash and impulsively that I just sat there going, GIRL, CHILL. I felt she redeemed herself in quite a few instances, but I just felt a bit of a disconnect from her in this one. I felt the same issue with Mr. Braddock as well.The cast of characters continued to grow in this one, and while I loved a lot of them, I felt like since the cast was SO large, a lot of the deeper characterization got a bit lost. I mean, I knew who a lot of them were and really enjoyed them, I felt that I just felt swarmed by cool characters and I was just really overwhelmed by them. However, I really liked the more in-depth characterization we got with Catherine and A-Person-That-Can't-Be-Named-For-Spoilers, and I absolutely adored the romance that was brought between them. I also really enjoyed that person a lot more than I did in the prior book. Shanker and Zekas can create a fantastic side character, though, and there are so many people that I absolutely loved like the addition of Mr. Adeoti and the Tuffins, and Miss Chen, Emily, and Laura were fantastic as well.I also felt a bit confused about Goode's motivations. Like, I know he was bad and we had to stop him, but I was confused about why he was doing what he was doing. I just felt a bit lost, and I just wanted more from this villain. The plot was interesting as well for the most part. I was totally enraptured in some parts, but some times, I was a bit unclear what was going on. I mean, they were kind of just sitting around and going in circles. It thought there were just things happening, and I couldn't figure out what was the big end game besides murder?? The ending didn't feel as concrete as I wished it would be. I was pleased mostly with it, but I guess I wanted something a bit more from it. To be honest, there wasn't too much romance in this one besides the official ending of the love triangle, and I was surprisingly okay with it. There was a lot of characterization and wrapping things up that they were handling that romance wasn't really a factor. I was pleased with the choice that was made because I did think it made the most sense and did feel organic; however, my heart did feel a bit jipped with the one side of the love triangle - which I knew was going to happen anyway since I loved both of the love interests dearly. Overall, I think it was a good ending to a fantastic series, but I just wanted a bit more from it. There were a few issues it, but it was still the fun and witty writing, characters, and plot twists that made me love this series in the first place. I honestly am so sad that this series is ending, because I just desperately want more from these characters, writing, and the plot. CAN THERE BE A SPIN-OFF SERIES PRETTY PLEASE WITH MR KENT JUST DOING MR KENT THINGS????? OR THE NEW GENERATION OF POWERED PEOPLE? PLEASE. I AM CRYING OVER HERE. Such a fantastic series, but three crowns and a Belle rating for this one!"}, {"userName": "Rachel Strolle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43164358-rachel-strolle", "userReview": "This is like the first book in a few weeks where I haven't put it down at all and just continuously read until the end.

The characters are smart and sweet and flawed and relatable. The plot is engaging and timely. The relationships are real and heart-wrenching. As a conclusion to the trilogy, These Vengeful Souls is right on the money. Shanker and Zekas tie up most loose ends while teasing out some new threads so that the characters can live on in your heart. Evelyn is such a compelling heroine, both courageous and selfish, and I loved watching her grapple with her flaws in this book. The supporting cast is just as compelling, with all the brooding from Braddock and all the wit from Kent that you've come to expect and love. The budding romance between Catherine and Rose is also so unbearably sweet, my heart could barely take it. Get ready for a twisting, turning ride full of squees and sighs and book-flinging and maybe some tears.

For starters, this book stays extremely true to its title in which it is really all about revenge. And trust us, while we do appreciate a good revenge plan (except for in real life, we would advise turning the other cheek), this scheme hardly qualifies as a \u201cplan\u201d. Most of the plot involves the characters arguing over whether they should get revenge on Mr. Goode, or if they should just run away. Obviously, since there wouldn\u2019t be a book if they just ran away, it took much too long for them to officially decide to stay and fight. Furthermore, once this decision was made, there was not much effort put into formulating a solid plan. Instead, the characters acted rashly and without thinking (classic YA), which led them into very unnecessary problems.One of the things we loved most about the previous books was the amazing cast of characters, and we were hoping so much for the last book to really wrap up each characters\u2019 story! However, this book kinda got carried away and threw in a million new characters who took away from getting to know some of the original cast better. And with so many new names and powers to remember, it made it extremely difficult to follow along with what was happening at times. Honestly, we are still pretty confused about all the events that took place in the story. There were so many plot holes and odd rules in the magic system that it was tough to picture exactly what was going on.Finally, this book lacked the romance we all so anticipated between Evelyn and Sebastian! There were such great humorous and heartwarming scenes between the two in the two in the previous books, and there were only maybe two short, rushed ones in this finale. Other than these few brief moments, it was also unclear as to exactly what their relationship was. Are they officially together? Are they just really close friends who sometimes kiss?? We need to know if this ship is sinking or not!!Whew! The Band-Aid is off! If you survived this far, here\u2019s the good news: there were some SUPER FUNNY moments spread throughout the book. Bless Evelyn\u2019s sassy stubbornness, Braddock\u2019s ever-broodingness, and Miss Chen\u2019s uncensored bluntness. However, the real star of the story was Mr. Kent! His incredibly witty retorts and clever use of his truth-telling power had us laughing out loud for hours! If you are unsure whether you want to finish the series, we would honestly recommend reading the final book just for him! All we want is for their to be a spin-off series focused on the many adventures of Mr. Kent and his brilliant life theories (still waiting to hear that Grand Ankle Theory). Dear Mr. Kent\u2026Overall, we just expected more. Although we love, love, loved the first two books and still hold them close to our hearts, we just did not have the same level of passion and affection for this one.

As he used his and Sebastian\u2019s powers to kill everyone at the ball, Goode permanently, destroyed their world and any hope for them to return to the life they once knew. But revenge comes with a high price. Evelyn will have to choose between putting her friends in danger, run from the city or just give up. When Goode turns the populace against them, can she find a way out without anyone else she cares for? A great sequel to These Ruthless Deeds and a great finale to the trilogy. After the shocking events of the previous instalment, I was very curious to know what would happen in this amazing world. I loved every chapter and I felt a little depressed when it was over so quickly. The plot is captivating, addictive and builds up perfectly. The development happens at a fast pace and throughout the story; the feeling of connection with the characters grows. At the same time, the thirst to see justice done and for the villain to pay for his crimes grows to the point it\u2019s impossible to let go of the book. The world is built to the minimal detail without being overly descriptive. The authors Tarun Shanker and Kelly Zekas continue to surprise me, how much they can bring to life with words and how much colour and depth they give this reality and their characters. The depth of everything is breathtaking. The reader is taken on a ride on a roller-coaster of emotions as the main characters live through the devastating events at the ball. Sebastien, the main male character, struggles to process what happened and to realise that his powers are responsible for all the death he witnessed. I truly left for him. The way Shanker and Zekas describe his turmoil is heart-breaking and truly brings the character out of the book. He is pushed to the ultimate limit when everything turns against him. Even if the killing wasn\u2019t completely his fault, I felt like his sanity was being tested and I must admit that I feared for it in certain chapters. Evelyn, the main female lead, turns her pain into anger and aims to catch the person that lead to that moment. She is ready to take him on and while other characters recommend caution, she just wants to face him and has a chance to end it all, to ease her pain and the pain everyone she loves. Her fury, passion, determination are impossible not make a difference in the reader. She is a true heroine with flaws but also with a depth that made me want to know her in person. In addition, the depth the authors describes their thoughts and feelings is admirable and brilliant. I could feel their emotions throughout the novel and almost stand with them through their trials. Captain Goode is a horrible character that manages to always make narrow escapes. It\u2019s very annoying to read about it. He\u2019s a tyrant with a dangerous gift that he uses intelligently. It makes it really hard to catch up to him or guess his next move. I think he\u2019s a great villain, a good story could never be as good without a bad guy/woman play on the same level or even higher than the good guys. Even so, I kept rutting for Evelyn and her revenge. The authors did a great work in building up the \u201chatred\u201d for Captain Goove. It definitely added spice and adrenaline to the story. A few new characters are introduced, each one with a unique ability and they all fit into the story, they made the difference. No loose ends, no loose characters. Perfect for me. A great ending to this amazing fantasy series. I have to get my hands on the paperback versions for sure. I highly recommend this collection to all the fans a different type of fantasy in a steampunk world and a badass female character!I want to the thank Xpresso Book Tours and the authors for accepting me as part of the book tour of These Vengeful Souls."}, {"userName": "Carolyn ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52816383-carolyn", "userReview": "Evelyn really got on my nerves."}, {"userName": "Samantha Glass", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8523296-samantha-glass", "userReview": "Well done!
