But that\u2019s how book club selections roll. It\u2019s a bit too chick lit for me. Toy is a single mom of a five year old daughter, living on The Isle of Palms. She\u2019s part of a loggerhead turtle rescue team and also works for the Charleston Aquarium. In typical chick lit fashion, you\u2019re quickly introduced to several good looking single men. I enjoyed learning about loggerhead turtles. In fact, I would have been happier if the book had delved more into the reason the turtles were suffering. The book does a good job focusing on the trials of a single woman, both young and old, without family to fall back on and the struggles with finances that can impose. I liked that the book focused on how friends can fill the role of family and how the friends were there for each other. But I really didn\u2019t feel that any of the characters were well developed. They all seemed to be created solely to fill a role. Older, single woman - check. Recently divorced woman - check. Married forties woman unable to stay pregnant - check. You get the idea\u2026Reading this book is like driving on a straight road. You can see what\u2019s coming up ahead a mile in advance. This is a decent read, just not overly exciting."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5210022-julie", "userReview": "Swimming Lessons by Mary Alice Monroe is a 2007 Mira publication. As we begin this second book in the \u201cBeach House\u201d series, we find five years have gone by, that Cara and Brett have married and are trying to start a family, which has been a very slow and painful process. Toy is living in the beach house with her young daughter \u2018Little Lovie\u2019, and has a great job working at the South Carolina Aquarium. Emmi has now divorced, but is taking it very, very hard, acting very impulsively as though she is trying to recapture her youth, and Cara is very concerned. Flo is still very much a part of their lives, too. But, they are all very surprised by a special visitor- a sick sea turtle- who arrives just as the turtle season begins. The \u2018Big Girl\u2019 turtle will need a lot of special care, which gives Toy a chance to shine in her career, but she also makes a new friend, who could become a lot more. \u2018Swim with a friend, never alone. Confidence is good- but too much can lead to danger.\u2019However, trouble comes at the most unexpected times, and threatens to turn everything on its ear, as dangerous connections reappear, threatening strong relationships and killing new ones in its wake. Once more it takes a group of strong women to gather around each other with support, love and friendship to weather the storm. Mary Alice Monroe is such a terrific writer. Her characters are so realistic, I sometimes find myself wanting to reach through the pages and comfort them or give them a good talking to. I also love how she manages to incorporate aquatic life into her stories, teaching readers about specific animals, while making them as much a character in the story as the humans. In this installment, some our favorite people lose their hard earned stability and find themselves making poor choices and paying hard consequences. There are misunderstandings and honest mistakes, along the way, in this amazing journey, especially for Toy. \u2018Dive in! Enjoy the feel of the water washing over you. Let go. You are swimming now!This is another very solid story featuring the characters we came to know and love in \u2018The Beach House\u2019. I am very much looking forward to reading \u2018Beach House Memories\u2019 and the latest book, \u2018Beach House for Rent\u2019. Just for fun: I found this in the book section of the NYT this morning.

You felt like you could be there with them. This is the sequel to Beach House which at the time I read Beach House didn't realize there was a sequel. This book brings closure to the characters in Beach House. It's about family, family, friendship, good times, and sad times. And as a bonus you learn about nature and the low country. I think what really draws you to her books is the peacefullness of the ocean, the beach and most of all the Loggerhead turtles. It's the circle of life with a little romance thrown into the mix!"}, {"userName": "Christine", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5447805-christine", "userReview": "I love this book, it continued on with the stories of Toy, Little Lovie, Cara and Flo, the famous turtle savers, they all come full circle and show what true love and true friendship really is..."}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1390765-diane", "userReview": "Swimming Lessons, by Mary Alice Monroe seemed to be the perfect audio book to ease into summer with. I generally love most books set on the shores of lovely South Carolina, and when I read that this one included a story about the cycle of life of the Loggerhead turtles of the Isle of Palms, it had a special meaning to me.Several years ago while on vacation, we were fortunate enough to be able to see these magnificent creatures lay their eggs along the shore. It was fascinating even though the area was later roped off as to not frighten the turtles away.In this story, we meet the Turtle Lady, Toy Spooner. She is a single mother who fled with her young daughter, Lovie, from an abusive relationship. She finds work at an aquarium, and it is here that before long we begin to see sparks between Toy and her boss Ethan. Some of the sea turtles in this story are sick and some weigh over 200 lbs. Toy is convinced to apply for a grant at the aquarium so that a turtle hospital can be set up to help these sick creatures heal.But this story has a bit more to it than just Toy, Lovie and sparks flying with Ethan. Lovie\u2019s father comes back into the picture complicating matters, all while several of Toy\u2019s friends are dealing with their own personal issues.Swimming Lessons is a light sort of read, in the style of Dorthea Benton Frank, or Anne Rivers Siddons. The ending was satisfying in that as the turtles begin to heal and prepare to go back out to sea, Toy, too, a once wounded woman also begins to heal.I did not realize that this story was in fact a sequel to an earlier book, The Beach House, which I never read. I don\u2019t feel it was necessary to have read that book to appreciate this story. If you are looking for a light summer read to add to your list, give this one a try."}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6743324-susan", "userReview": "Sequel to the beach house, continuing from one character's point of view. Immediately read this after the Beach House. Wonderful book, you really want to root for the main character's success, love interest and career as biologist. What a success story for a young female character who had an abusive boyfriend in book I and was estranged from her irresponsible parents. Loved this book and looking to read many more of Monroe's books. This is about the power of female friendships and the turns life can take. Buy The Beach House and this one together because it will leave you wanting for more, I would like to see a third book with these lovable characters."}, {"userName": "C-shaw", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2663695-c-shaw", "userReview": "Loaned to me by a friend who is on a mission to read all of Mary Alice Monroe's books.

Toy Sooner and her daughter, Little Lovie are living in Primrose Cottage on the beach where Miss Lovie fiercely cared for and tended to her Loggerhead Turtles. Every year, the turtle ladies, watched for the migration of the mama turtles coming ashore to nest and lay their golf-ball sized eggs. Since Miss Lovie's death, Toy has gone on to college, graduated, and secured a life for her and her daughter. She works as an aquarist at the Aquarium. She hasn't seen her deadbeat boyfriend since he left her on the steps of a shelter after giving birth to Little Lovie. Toy has found comfort, safety and love with the women of this town and they have become her family. Cara (Miss Lovie's daughter), along with her husband, Brett rent out the beach house to her. Flo, the elderly next door neighbor is a godsend and reliable babysitter, and Emmi has a heart of gold. Toy is not ready to love again, but unexpectedly finds a soul mate in Ethan Legare. Slowly, they build a loving and seemingly unbreakable relationship, when out of the blue, Little Lovie's biological father shows up on Toy's doorstep. Her world is turned upside down. Just as the loggerhead turtles must find their way in darkness and uncertainly, but with an instinct for preservation, Toy, too, summons up courage and fortitude to build a loving and comfortable home for herself, Little Lovie and incredibly, the patient and sensible Ethan."}, {"userName": "Elle", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3139044-elle", "userReview": "This is a continuation of Mary Alice Monroe's story 'The Beach House'. I read 'Beach House Memories' and then 'Swimming Lessons' only because I wanted to read the prequel to 'The Beach House' before continuing on with the story. That said, if you haven't read the other two books, reading 'Swimming Lessons' could be read as a stand-alone book.This book is the story of Toy Sooner. It is five years after she had her baby, Little Lovie. Toy has now finished college and works at the South Carolina Aquarium. She begins a rehabilitation program for sick sea turtles and works closely with her boss Ethan to get a grant to begin a turtle hospital at the aquarium. There are a few twists and turns in this story line (which I won't give away here), but they kind of felt rushed to me for some reason. I liked this story a lot, it's just that at one point too many things started to happen and then were tied up quickly toward the end. This book also continues on with the characters Cara, Brett, Flo and Emmi. An enjoyable read with more learning about the loggerhead sea turtles.

This book is about Toy Sooner, the pregnant teenager of Book 1. She is without Daryl and it's 5 years later. Due to Lovie's guidance and acceptance of Toy into her family and home, Toy has really made a good life for herself and her daughter. She got a college degree and lives in the Beach House. I wondered if I would love this book as much as the first, yes I do. Thanks in no small part to the loggerhead turtles and the Beach House. Toy starts a turtle hospital at the aquarium where she has been working for years. This happens when she rescues a special mamma turtle, \"Big Girl\". The last book didn't have a specific turtle star, but this one is an interesting character here. Cara is married to Bret, who is a very likeable character. Lovie's Beach house is still prominent in the story, though Lovie is gone.... Look for her to be prominent in the next book of the series: Beach House Memories. This book is mostly about Toy, with Daryl breezing in for a few chapters. If you read Book 1, you won't trust her old boyfriend, Daryl, also her daughter's father, and his snakey ways. You also will question his behavior - very grown up here... Is this possible in a character who has spent 5 years in California, traveling with a band??? Especially after his disappearing act in Book 1? And what about the new boyfriend and also Toy's boss, Ethan??? I sure enjoyed him in the book and really rooted for Toy to end up with him.... Who will Toy choose?Bret and Cara are so adorable but have troubles of their own trying to get pregnant as she is so old... Her pregnancy struggles were once mine and the multiple miscarriages, yep, I've been there and know that heartache, both physical and emotional... They are a great couple and great as family for Toy and Little Lovie, her daughter. Love that name for Toy's daughter because I really loved Cara's mom, Lovie , in the first book.Light reading, predictable at times, but no less enjoyable, BEACH READ."}], "description": "It's been five years since the original turtle lady, old Miss Lovie Rutledge, passed away, but her legacy lives on with some special women, especially Toy and her daughter, young Little Lovie.Toy Sooner kept her graveside vow to her beloved mentor.
