Who I love to hate.Again like the first book, Love and the Zombie Apocalypse I could NOT put this down! Sleep? Food? Who needs that when you have zombies!. Read this in one sitting, just a few hours. Ended too soon! Ugh! And that cliffhanger? Shook my kindle so hardsilently yelling Nnoo!! ( because it was 1am) I need more!!The authors writing style draws me in. I feel like I'm killing zombies alongside Rachel, freaking out with Lindsey, laughing with Nicky,And getting romantic with Cage........but wait is that a love triangle starting up with Adam?Chelsea Luna Bellinger you rock! This may have only been the second book I've read of yours, but you have yet to disappoint.If your other books are as great as these I doubt I will ever be."}, {"userName": "Melissapalmer404", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7812505-melissapalmer404", "userReview": "Book #36 Read in 2014Death and the Zombie Apocalypse by Chelsea Bellingeri (YA)This is the second in a great young adult trilogy. This book picks up right where the first book left off...Rachel is trying to rescue Cage from the zombie that have overrun the college dorm. This book is once again non-stop action...with a little humor and romance thrown in. Rachel, Cage and their friends are trying to make it to Detroit to one of the military \"safe zones\" but of course that is easier said than done. I read this book in just over two hours....I cannot wait for book three (published sometime this year).

But then I just continued, and also read the third book. 3.5 hours later since the time I went to bed, and I had both finished. :PThis book immediately starts off where the last one left us, and I just adored that. You can just continue reading like it is one book split in two. Rachel is searching for Cage, and Cage is searching for a way out and also to be reunited with Rachel. It was quite a harrowing few chapters. I am not sure what scares me more, adult zombies, or little kids. I think I pick the little kids as scariest. For so many reasons. We pick up a new character along the way, and I have to say I did like the little guy a lot. He was strong, swift, stealthy, and he was dedicated to help out. Not a lot of little kids would have done the same, so I was very happy to see this character get added. And they are off to a safe zone, or at least they hope so. On the way they go to Adam's family, and well, I have to say I liked Manny (though not so much later on), but Jorge was just terrible. I knew from the start what would happen, and I was kind of surprised that Manny didn't see it. Cage's reaction was a bit wow, sure, I can imagine why he did it, but it felt a bit overkill. I wasn't all that happy with what Jorge did. It is just not something I would like to see in my books.Like with the previous book, don't get too attached to characters. I won't spoil anything of course, but wow. :( :( The safe zone and what happened there? I wasn't that surprised by that outcome, it is something we see often in zombie books. Still I was sad for our characters, they deserve a moment of peace, quiet, and safety.I have to say I am getting a bit tired of everyone and their mother falling for Rachel. :| It just got hilariously stupid. Suddenly x would be falling for Rachel. Then y would be falling for Rachel. All the while Cage got jealous. The ending? What happened there? NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOEESSSS *cries her eyes out*. That is all I will say. As for my favourite character, it definitely switched to Nicky. I already liked him in the previous book, but I like his banter and outlook on everything even more now. Plus I love how sweet he is towards Lindsay. Lindsay wasn't someone I liked at the beginning, and in the previous book I disliked her even more. But in this book I slowly started to see a different girl in her. A girl that just wants love and happiness. But all in all I did enjoy this book a lot. There was a lot that went on, quite a few scary moments, zombies zombies and more zombies, sadness, and some romance.Review first posted at https://twirlingbookprincess.com"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21819471-stephanie", "userReview": "A great continuation of the story started in the first book.

(Zombies and cute, right?), the trouble is the underwhelming language used throughout; ala: after school special triteness. The idea and the characters are decent overall, but some lines used in every book, too often, make my head hurt with how much better the book could have been if the author took the time to establish better language. E.G.: \"Her clothes looked like she had spent a week fighting zombies.\" So it's a fair reading, decent scope, but the language is jolty, and at times, so are the characters; it makes what could be an excellent story a bit subpar."}, {"userName": "Abbie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10194401-abbie", "userReview": "Actual rating - 3.5"}, {"userName": "Phylwil", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5059836-phylwil", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book from a Goodreads giveaway. This is the 2nd book in a planned trilogy, so I read the first book before this one. It is advisable to start with the first book, as this book begins, with little explanation, where the first one ended.Both books are very simply written, with teenaged protaganists, for a young adult audience. They do not, however, fail to deliver the horrifying, fast-moving action that one would expect from a zombie tale, and there is no reluctance to kill a sympathetic character. For those who are interested primarily in the romantic connections made between various characters, there is some of that as well.Despite the face that I am not the intended audience, I enjoyed this book and would suggest it for any teenager looking for a little zombie escapism."}, {"userName": "Heather", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27608829-heather", "userReview": "All I can say is OMG....didn't see that death coming.
