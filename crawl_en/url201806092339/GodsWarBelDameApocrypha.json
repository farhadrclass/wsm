It wasn\u2019t until much later that I understood most of the fantasy settings I read were based on a highly sanitized Western medieval framework (Do I hear George Costanza in the background saying, \u201cnot that there\u2019s anything wrong with that\u201c?) I\u2019ve found that those familiar types of settings and stories no longer hold my interest to the same degree. I live in a world that is broader, more complicated, and more importantly, has even more stories to offer that reflect different cultures and perspectives. The most satisfying stories have echoed that philosophy, stretching genre conventions, drawing upon a wider range of cultural traditions and bridging genres. God\u2019s War has earned a place on my shortlist of fantasy books that are able to successfully breathe fresh air into the fantasy genre. Nyxnissa is a bel dame (echoing the \u201cBelle Dame sans Merci\u201c) who has made her living as an assassin for the government of Nasheen, hunting down the men who have deserted posts at the war front. She\u2019s fallen on hard times, however, and also works as a bounty hunter bringing in thieves or those dealing in illegal gene trading. Lately she\u2019s doing a bit of that black market gene transporting as well. After serving a prison sentence, she gives up the independent work and recruits a crew. When Nyx is called to the palace by the Queen, she and her team are given a job they can\u2019t refuse: hunting down an alien woman who has disappeared, likely into the enemy territory of Chenja. Rhys is a magician and immigrant from Chenja, where women wear the veil and men are head of household. When Nyx is recruiting for her team, Rhys agrees to work with her.The plotting says \u2018heist,\u2019 but the setting says \u201cMiddle East in space.\u201d It seems this world began centuries ago when it was settled by colonists from another world. Their world is at the edge of the space routes and as they\u2019ve elected not to modernize their spaceport, off-world visitors are rare, leaving the colonists isolated. For over a century, Nasheen and Chenja have been at war. Although very different culturally, they share a similar religious foundation: all consider themselves \u201cPeople of the Book\u201d (being ill-versed in world religions, I only thought of People of the Book, not of the more germane \u201cmonotheistic Abrahamic religions\u201c). (This is one book I would have benefited by reading on Kindle with Wikipedia at hand). Nyx\u2019 disenchantment with her own religion and Rhys\u2019 dedication to his provide an interesting contrast and social commentary. Social and religious divisions are further complicated by a marginalized class of people who have carry shapeshifting genetics. She didn\u2019t much like the stink and crowd of cities, but you could lose yourself in a city a lot more easily than you could out in farming communities like Mushirah. She had run to the desert and the cities for anonymity. And to die for God.None of that had worked out very well.Nasheen is a matriarchal government and culture; men are sent off to war and only allowed home if they reach forty. Sexuality is open and lesbian relationships are normalized, although male homosexuality is still somewhat hidden. I was half-expecting the Women\u2019s Studies 1o1 version of matriarchy, but instead Hurley is far more nuanced. Male or female; everyone has mixed motives; varied upbringings and ethics\u2013or lack thereof\u2013drive them towards their decisions. As is often noted, everyone is fighting the war in their own way. The preponderance of bugs in the magicians\u2019 quarters made his blood sing, as if he was attuned to a bit of everything, able to touch and manipulate pieces of the world. He felt more alive here than he had anywhere else in his life, among those who spent their days coming up with new and interesting ways to kill his people.Then there are the bugs, a world-building aspect that takes the story to a whole new level of uniqueness. Some people\u2013\u2018magicians\u2019\u2013have the ability to manipulate the bugs and their energy. Some of the technology is hybrid-organic, and the bugs play a role in powering vehicles, lighting rooms and in healing. Magicians are the only men granted an exception to serving at the war front.It\u2019s a complicated set-up with a non-English foundations and Hurley doesn\u2019t handhold. I thought it flowed reasonably well given the range of components, but it was the kind of wind that pushes you a little harder, making for an exhilarating sail. The first forty pages are virtually an independent short story; the development of the larger plot comes later, with roots in the prologue. The story \u2018works\u2019 in the China Mi\u00e9ville sense (and I\u2019m thinking of Embassytown here), so take that for what it\u2019s worth; people who don\u2019t read much in sci-fi or fantasy may wish for more explanation and those who have little tolerance for gender dynamics might find themselves irritated. I thought the relatively straightforward plot balanced the complicated setting and ethical issues nicely. It was engrossing, interesting, and occasionally melancholic. Nyx is truly a belle dame sans merci\u2013 she has a very bloody, culturally sanctioned job, but her lack of compassion also extends to herself. It reminded me of the torturer Glokta in Abercrombie\u2019s The First Law series, or the lead in Best Served Cold. It provides an avenue for compassionate development of a deeply flawed human.Without doubt, God\u2019s War deserves its Nebula nomination\u2013as well as the Arthur C. Clarke and British Sci-Fi Association nominations. That said, I\u2019m not sure everyone would enjoy it. But if you are looking for complicated, unusual fantasy with a fast-moving plot, give this a try. I\u2019ll certainly be moving on to the next in the series,InfidelFour and a half bloody stars"}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3095901-karen", "userReview": "I picked this up after reading the first few sentences online:\"Nyx sold her womb somewhere between Punjai and Faleen, on the edge of the desert.Drunk, but no longer bleeding, she pushed into a smoky cantina just after dark and ordered a pinch of morphine and a whiskey chaser. She bet all of her money on a boxer named Jaks, and lost it two rounds later when Jaks hit the floor like an antique harem girl.\"That is a kick-ass entry to a story, if you ask me. Hang on, this is a long review.This is...science fiction adventure noir, maybe? It's a world of (mostly) post-apocalyptic Muslims of varying degrees of recognizability, in which most technology is driven by insects. Yes. Also, the two major nations of the planet have been at war forever, and partly as a result of this women have come to dominate society. Men get drafted as boys and sent to the front--and women volunteer to fight, too. But on the home front, at least in the country where we spend the most time, women are soldiers and politicians and businesspeople and pretty much everything else. They're also brutal to each other--the main pastime seems to be boxing, and just about every woman we meet has some violent tendencies or history. This isn't a pacifist Hertopia kind of world.That's one of the things I loved about this book--its bold creation of a world where women dominate, and where women are socially, physically, and in all other ways tough and capable. Setting aside the fact that this is a world where magicians use bug technology to repair amputations and mortal injuries, the women in this world are bad-ass. Or maybe they're just people. It's a sad statement that it's so unusual to read about women in roles that men would usually fill, kicking asses and getting their asses kicked--but it is unusual. And Hurley does a great job of making her women real.I appreciated so many things about this book--that the dominant religious ideology was Muslim rather than Christian, that the main characters are almost all non-white, that our antihero Nyx isn't a stick figure, and that she doesn't stay pretty. There's a phenomenon in novels and movies that feature \"strong\" or \"kick-ass\" women (cf. Tomb Raider, Charlie's Angels, Kill Bill, Underworld, et al)--let's call it the \"reasonable facsimile\" phenomenon. It's when authors or directors decide they're going to capitalize on a trend provide a strong female role model--and they do so by casting a skinny white girl in a tank top, and telling her to look brooding. Usually the reasonable facsimile doesn't have a realistic or profound story arc, or much character development (if she's a secondary character she may be defined solely by a skill, like rock climbing), or much to do besides fake-fight guys who would kick her ass in real life, because she has wrists like twigs and has clearly come from the Fighting School of Pilates. Seriously, watching Michelle Rodriguez decline from her tough, meaty role in Girlfight to the dumb bullshit action stuff she does now...that's the reasonable facsimile tragedy, right there.But anyway. I loved that this book doesn't dredge up the reasonable facsimile. Nyx, as a protagonist, is thorny and crude and rebarbative, she's physically large and strong, she carries weight both literally and figuratively. She has a full, complete character arc, a history, and (presumably) a future--since this is the first book in a trilogy. I admit I didn't follow all the political intrigue in this one, but that's me--I tend to read lightly over that stuff, and dwell more in the scenes. And it's possible that some of that explanation got a little convoluted, in an effort to propel us to the ending. I can forgive that, because the world of the book is so original and well-imagined, and because I liked the characters that live in it. The second book, Infidel, just came out in October. A third is in the works. I have a feeling I'll be reading 'em."}, {"userName": "ambyr", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2670408-ambyr", "userReview": "Orson Scott Card talks a lot in his How to Write Science Fiction and Fantasy about exposition, and about how science fiction and fantasy readers react to it with different expectations than non-genre readers. Roughly summarized, his point is that if you open a story with, \"She mounted her graazchak,\" an experienced genre reader will think, \"Huh. Okay, there's a creature called a graazchak and it can be ridden. I'll keep that in mind, and keep an eye out for more information about what it looks like and what it does.\" Someone who mostly reads literary fiction, on the other hand, is likely to react, \"A graazchak? What the hell is a graazchak? Does the author expect me to know?\" and grind to a halt.I am definitely an experienced genre reader, and I actively seek out that sense of \"I don't know what's going on, but I'm sure I'll piece it together given time.\" God's War provides it, over and over again, from its politics to its bug-based tech to its characters' backstories. In places, though, the exposition is a little too rough even for me. Sometimes it's small things, like the interchangeable use of \"sister\" for both Nyx's sister-by-birth and the other bel dames in the opening chapter. If they'd consistently been, oh, I don't know, \"gene sisters\" and \"blood sisters,\" I would have noted the terms, assumed they'd be defined later, and forged onward. Instead, I found myself flipping backward, trying to work out whether there were two different categories at all. Other times it's bigger things, like the timeskip after the opening chapters, which left me feeling lost and unanchored in time; lacking any clearly defined markers, I couldn't see how Nyx and Rhys's timelines were supposed to align.But I figured it out eventually, and once the story got going, the exposition got smoother. (Though there were a few places where it erred in the other direction with info dumps--Taite's backstory comes to mind here.) That let me spend more time admiring the uniqueness of the world and, more than anything, the characters. And I fell in love. Nyx, Rhys, Taite, Khos, Inaya--they are all horribly broken and horribly flawed, and I can't look away. I love that their flaws are not sexy flaws--no \"too quick to anger in the face of injustice\" or \"a dark and brooding loner\" here--and that the narrative never flinches from them, from Nyx's lack of intelligence (too many blows to the head from boxing?) and Rhys's cowardice and everything else.I love this for not being the story of how they all set aside their differences and work together, but instead how their differences tear them apart and keep tearing. I love this for telling the story of star-crossed lovers--Nyx and Rhys--kept apart not by external forces but by their own internal beliefs, which they have no interest in moving beyond. I love this for being different, for being new, for never taking me where I expected.Also the bugs are pretty nifty, and I say this as someone who shrieks and screams for back-up when she sees a spider on the kitchen floor."}, {"userName": "Jokoloyo", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1902630-jokoloyo", "userReview": "I am excited with feminism in SF or Fantasy stories, because I can expect a really different way of life/thinking, not just fictitious world with people who has same way/thinking as ours.Reading this novel gave me that. It gave more exciting to me with Middle-East like world building with its well-known social politic conflicts. Oh, I love the setting.And the main protagonist is one bad ass person. She even seems extremely bad ass due to our standard of way of thinking (e.g. she coldly sold her own womb).I can't give 5 star because the the story itself is not exactly match my taste. It seems unfair if I gave 5 star to first books of Malazan and First Law, but not this debut novel. My reasons are: The story and characters are too dark and a bit tedious for my taste. It does not have enough humor or heart warming dialogues. The quote on back cover from SFX mentioned this book as \"fast pace thriller\", but for me the story is a bit slow.If you fine with pure dark fantasy, go find this novel. There is not enough explanation of the magic system of this book, but it is common nowadays in a first book of a trilogy. Let's hope the second book has more magic system explanations.

No gods are involved in the telling of the tale, just a bunch of people who believe in Allah and Jehova in a far future world that seems awfully like the Gaza Strip, only filled with Magicians who control bugs by their will and shapeshifters (Shifters). Traditional military hardware is available everywhere you look, too, and most of our focus is firmly on a hard-as-nails normal female.We get to see her in her youth as a part of an official assassination squad, the betrayal and her downfall, and her poverty and life as part of a small squad of bounty-hunters.I had some issue with this. The writing was rather sparse when it came to fleshing out each of the characters and it took me a long time to care who each of them were, other than Nyx, of course. And then there were long sequences in the text where I was flooded with names and names and names and very little hook to keep my interest. At that point, my hopes rested entirely on the brilliant and complex world that was being laid out before me. It was absolutely enormous and complex and well-thought out. My only concerns were with the characters.And then I had my first transformation. I didn't have a problem with the boxing, and the small squad scenes were so-so, but when Nyx and I got to spend some time alone, the text came alive. I shuddered and thanked all the stars in heaven. The novel went from burdensome to snappy.My next transformation came when the rest of the characters finally started coming to life through their choices and actions, and it took just a little bit too much time to get there, but it did, and for that, I am eternally grateful. The climax was especially personal and rich in both action and characters, and at this point, I am now a fanboy.Worldbuilding kicked this off, but eventually, the characters carried the day. I'm not going to have any issues picking up and devouring the next books, unless I have to start from scratch. :) Who knows? It's not like I've done any research on this series.

It would be too obvious to call this gritty, so I'll go the extra mile and explain that I kept asking questions of the world building like okay, seriously, you've been massacring your populations for a hundred years at the front, and yet both societies are still built around sending bodies out to fight? Bodies from where? And then Hurley told me where the new population growth comes from in a nearly casual aside, and I went . . . oh, swallowed hard, and moved on. This is a bloody, awful world, vividly drawn, and pretty close to fascinating. Unfortunately, the character work was done with a much heavier hand, and I found myself impatient with a lot of it. Also with the gender politics \u2013 this is one of those worlds where women are far more likely to survive than men, so you have most of the problems of the patriarchy but in reverse, plus a few extra. That aspect, like much of the work regarding the religious conflict itself, felt like pieces of machinery put carefully together and then not connected up to anything else. I don't know, I wanted more out of it than I got.Basically, it's a debut, and it interested and annoyed me in shifting proportions. I felt much more cheerful about it when I realized that I don't really want to read the next two books in this trilogy.

I was actually hooked by the 2nd in the series for this and another one (Infidel and Yarn), and found the first for both series so that I could eventually read those 2nd ones.Well, that was a pointless paragraph.This is a mess of a world. Echoes of Dune and Mad Max. It's the far future and we're shown a planet that had been inhabited by various groups of followers of a never-named religion, although it's obvious which one from the brief (brief like skivvies, not brief like too short) tidbits and descriptions of the cultures. But rather than being united by their belief, they are suspicious of each other if not outright hostile. There's been biological evolution. One of the nations has twisted itself about such that women have become dominant.This book follows a woman scarred and actually still bleeding (figuratively) from a war that has been going on long enough that its cause has been forgotten (or rather, I'd forgotten it in the course of reading...don't remember, oops). We see her further downfall, skip ahead to years later where she's in a rut but with a loyal team, and then the destruction of the team. We learn that her brittleness covered pain, although only at the very end. There's no mass killing-off of main characters, a la GRRM, but there is breaking, inside and out.The writing has this fleshy oomph to it, enough that I was able to stick to it over the weeks I needed to read it in small, limited bites.

Yes, this is my first complaint because I had hoped for more, far more detail. If you've followed me for a while, you may know that The Stars Are Legion by Kameron Hurley is one of my favorite books of all time because a) it's an all-lesbian space opera with a villain romance and b) it has creepy biopunk horror descriptions and I love them.There was so much potential for biopunk horror descriptions here, but it didn't go in that direction most of the time and I'm sad. Not enough insect limbs. People replace organs regularly but no one has tried to grow antennae. Not good. Be weirder.(I also read this while I was recovering from surgery and this book starts with the main character being perfectly functional right after the removal of one of her body parts, her womb. I feel personally attacked.)This book is set in Nasheen, a violent matriarchy, and Chenja, a patriarchal, very religious society - and they are at war for... reasons. Vague reasons. There are also shapeshifters and various countries disagree on shapeshifter ethics. Everything is set in a very vaguely-middle-eastern world.The worldbuilding felt like someone was playing the throw-ideas-at-the-page-and-see-what-sticks game, because there were so many things going on at the same time and none of them made sense together. It's not that I didn't like them, it's that they didn't always feel developed nor thematically coherent.Now, let's talk about the religious themes. I loved that the main character of a book focused on religion and holy war was a bisexual atheist, and I loved how the setup of the societies allowed the author to play with gender roles. Ruthless women and religious, physically weak men aren't a common combination. Female characters aren't usually allowed to be the way Nyx is, morally gray and violent and aggressive and still not villains. This book also showed many different kinds of strength in different female characters.On the other hand, for a book about a holy war, very little is said about the actual religion. Some characters pray, some don't, some believe and some hate others for not believing, but what do they actually believe in? All I know is that the religion is vaguely inspired from Islam, it borrows some characteristics like clothing (hijabs are mentioned) but is not Islam.This feels like lazy writing, if not appropriation.I liked the characters - a diverse squad! a main character with dyslexia in SFF! - but I don't know if I want to read a whole trilogy from their point of view since I didn't care about the world."}, {"userName": "Terence", "userReviewDate": "Jun 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1019174-terence", "userReview": "[Nyx can\u2019t forgive herself for failing to save her brothers and for a mistake that killed her squad during her time at the front; Rhys can\u2019t forgive himself for fleeing from service at the front.

Take God\u2019s War, the first novel by Kameron Hurley, an author whose blog I\u2019ve been reading with interest. The book had a long journey getting published (which you can read about on said blog) and has now, finally, reached the shelves thanks to the awesome folks at Night Shade Books. I was excited to get my hands on this book, because it\u2019s in a sub-genre (or maybe more accurately, the cross-section of a few sub-genres) I love, has a number of features I usually appreciate in books, and seems completely and in every way like a book that I should love unconditionally... but despite enjoying and admiring much of it, God\u2019s War didn\u2019t completely deliver on my expectations.Living on the planet Umayma isn\u2019t easy. The world is extremely inhospitable, and even relatively short exposure to outside conditions quickly leading to cancers and various other unpleasant consequences. In addition, war has been raging for years, mainly between the countries of Nasheen and Chenja over religious differences. Chemical and biological weapons are used as a matter of course. It just really isn\u2019t a fun place to live, folks. In Nasheen, women are effectively in charge because virtually every semi-adult male has been shipped off to the war front. One of the most powerful groups in this country is the government-funded assassins known as \u201cbel dames,\u201d which on the surface may sound like French for \u201cbeautiful ladies\u201d but actually has other other meaningful connotations, if you care to dig a little deeper. One of these bel dames is the novel\u2019s protagonist Nyxnissa (or \u201cNyx\u201d for short), but right from the start it is clear that Nyx isn\u2019t exactly playing by the bel dames\u2019 rules. Before long, Nyx is an independent mercenary who gets involved in a plot that will affect the future of the entire planet... and who will have some of her former colleagues out for her blood.Starting this review with a description of the planet rather than the characters seems natural, because world-building is one of the real strengths of God\u2019s War. Kameron Hurley does an amazing job creating a very realistic dystopian setting. In addition, her prose is consistently sharp and descriptive, so even when you\u2019re not 100% sure what\u2019s going on, it\u2019s always a pleasure to read. Take, for example, the novel\u2019s first paragraphs:Nyx sold her womb somewhere between Punjai and Faleen, on the edge of the desert.Drunk, but no longer bleeding, she pushed into a smoking cantina just after dark and ordered a pinch of morphine and a whiskey chaser. She bet all of her money on a boxer named Jaks, and lost it two rounds later when Jaks hit the floor like an antique harem girl.Nyx lost every coin, a wad of opium, and the wine she\u2019d gotten from the butchers as a bonus for her womb. But she did get Jaks into bed, and \u2014 loser or not \u2014 in the desert after dark, that was something.This type of dark, atmospheric, cutting prose can be found throughout God\u2019s War. What\u2019s even more impressive: as you read on, you\u2019ll find that there\u2019s actually a ton of information hidden in those first few sentences.One of the most intriguing world-building elements is the novel\u2019s magic system \u2014 if that\u2019s what it is, because even though the practitioners (who are able to control the bugs that are used for fuel, food and other things) are referred to as \u201cmagicians,\u201d their power could just as well be one of those \u201csufficiently advanced technologies\u201d that\u2019s indistinguishable from magic, or (maybe more likely) a genetic mutation of some sort, if a fleeting reference to magicians using pheromones to control the bugs is an indicator. A second type of maybe-magic-maybe-not is used by the \u201cshifters,\u201d humans that are able to change into animals. Finally, there also appears to be a network of gates connecting the magicians\u2019 \u201cgyms\u201d in various cities. How it all works is never explained in detail, but all of it is extremely exotic and fascinating \u2014 and that\u2019s not even mentioning the mysterious \u201cbakkie\u201d vehicles (fueled by, of course, bugs) and the fact that both organs and blood seem to be a tradable commodity on Umayma. Amazingly, there are enough unique and intriguing world-building ideas in God\u2019s War to fill more than one novel.However, for such an innovative concept, there\u2019s very little exposition to be found in God\u2019s War. Almost nothing is spelled out for the reader, so there\u2019s a serious learning curve while you try to find your bearings. I ended up going back and re-reading the first 4 chapters (which comprise \u201cPart 1\u201d of the novel and are really a very long prologue setting up the main intrigue in Part 2), just to make sure I hadn\u2019t missed some key point that would connect the dots before moving on to the rest of the novel. Of course, lots of science fiction and fantasy introduces unfamiliar elements. Anyone who reads enough speculative fiction eventually develops what Jo Walton calls an SFF reading skillset and knows to keep reading, because usually things will become more clear as the story develops, but in this case I somehow found myself more disoriented than normally would be the case. Easing a reader into a brand new fictional universe is an art; as much as I admire God\u2019s War, it\u2019s definitely not as accessible as it could have been. Regardless, I\u2019d rather read a choppy book filled with strikingly original ideas than a smooth book without any innovation.When I said Umayma isn\u2019t a fun place to live, that\u2019s really just the tip of the iceberg because this novel is dark, dark, dark. Yes, the planet is a violent, poisoned, war-ravaged place, but that\u2019s not all: the novel features an amazing amount of violence, some explicit torture scenes, lots of drug use, and generally a stunning amount of sheer human misery. Just the descriptions of the world\u2019s effects on people are enough to make your skin crawl:He had stayed as far from the contagion clouds as possible, but when he stumbled through Chenja and into the nearest Nasheenian border town, he was hacking up his lungs in bloody clumps and his skin burned and bubbled like tar.Even as someone who loves dystopian fiction, this book is such a relentless assault of darkness and unpleasantness that it eventually started to get to me. Then again, if \u201cany reaction is better than no reaction\u201d is true, God\u2019s War is successful at least in that its gritty, grisly environment did affect me strongly.The novel\u2019s characters are introduced in much the same way as its fictional universe: without much exposition. They\u2019re tight-lipped and hard to figure (not to mention mostly unlikeable), so it takes a while for them to grow on you. The two main characters, Nyx and Rhys (a Chenjan with some magic skills who ends up in Nyx\u2019s crew) eventually evolve into real people: Nyx, the brash and independent main focus of the story should please any reader who enjoys a kick-ass female protagonist, and Rhys, who is more soft-spoken and gentle, almost seems out of place in this book (it would be great to learn more about his life in Chenja before the start of God\u2019s War in future novels). Unfortunately, most of the side-characters (including the members of Nyx\u2019s mercenary crew, her main rival Taite, and especially the other bel dames) remain relatively two-dimensional. Combine this with the constant, grinding darkness, and by the end of the novel I was so numb that the story's explosive climax just didn't hit me as hard as it should have.So, there you have it: an aggressively dark, highly original SF-fantasy novel with tight, cutting prose and some of the most inventive world-building I\u2019ve seen in a while (trust me, there\u2019s much, much more going on than I\u2019ve described in this review). Some aspects of this debut novel are simply great, others don\u2019t work, but in the end, if you like your SFF dark and edgy, you simply have to give God\u2019s War a try. Kameron Hurley is a promising new author with a distinctive voice and a terrific (not to say terrifying) imagination. There\u2019s not a shred of doubt in my mind that, as she continues to write and evolve, we\u2019ll be treated to some amazing novels by her in the future. Even if this first novel didn\u2019t click 100% for me, I\u2019ll be first in line to read whatever she produces next.This review was also published at www.fantasyliterature.com on 1/12/2011.)"}, {"userName": "Bastard", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4034296-bastard", "userReview": "http://bastardbooks.blogspot.com/2012...\nGod's War\n by Kameron Hurley was a top read of mine last year, and my favorite novel from a debut author with a tough competition. Been meaning to write something about it for some time now, but was struggling with what I wanted to say given that it's been a year since I read it. Details are currently a bit fuzzy. Just found out that the novel has been nominated for a Nebula for Best Novel in 2011, so seems like a good time as any to say a few things about it. It's the first book in the \nBel Dame Apocrypha\n series, in what I understand may be a trilogy from which two novels are already released.Nyx is a former Bel Dame, a government\u00a0sanctioned\u00a0assassin among other duties, surviving amidst a war. She's now a bounty hunter, leading a group of specialized misfits, who has been tasked by the Queen to bring the head of an individual who holds the secrets to a weapon that will change the balance of the war. In a violent and cruel world, filled with bug magic and technology, Nyx has an uphill battle in her hands while former allies and current enemies try to kill her in a game which Nyx is not aware she's a pawn in.Months before it was released, I was sold in pre-ordering a copy with the cool cover and a short description that included something about cutting heads. Later on I read Mad Hatter's review, in which he labels the books as a bugpunk and I knew I had to read it as soon as I got my hands on it. Needless to say that I wasn't disappointed.\nGod's War\n is not an easy book to read. Though there's some complexity to the plot, it seems evident to me that the author doesn't have much interest in spoon feeding the reader. The experience through the novel was one of playing catch-up. I personally liked this aspect of it, but I can see some readers get frustrated or have trouble getting into the rhythm of things.\u00a0In addition to that, the book has plenty of crazy violent and disturbing scenes. Awesome, right?I recall being asked a few months ago who was my favorite female character in fantasy, and the clear choice was Nyx. Well, a tie really with Kate Daniels, but in any case Nyx is just great. She's a walking contradiction and tough as they come. I really don't know what to make of her, she's allover the place. One thing you can count on though is that she'll be hard to kill and kick some ass in the process. But I still don't know what to make of her. Is she patriotic? A rebel? Loyal? Untrustworthy? Selfish? Compassionate? Dependable? Crazy? Well, we know she's a bit nuts, but other than that you can make arguments for and against any label you try to apply to her, which makes her a very interesting character to me.Nyx aside, the biggest strength of \nGod's War\n is the interesting and unique world building. The society we focus on is Islam\u00a0influenced, but with a reversal of gender roles in various ways. It's\u00a0matriarchal\u00a0and males are sent off to the\u00a0front-lines\u00a0of the war, where chances are they won't return. A cool dynamic which was handled quite well without centering on gender differences, but on circumstances which has led them to their current situation where the male population is decreasing at a rapid pace and females hold the power of the governing bodies. There are other countries in this world that have their own distinct circumstances, but our action was mainly focused on the civilization depicted above.I made mention of the the book being described as a bugpunk. Insect manipulation plays a big role in this world. They're used in their technological advances, for medical procedures, as weapons, transportation, among other uses. Those who manipulate them are called magicians. There's just a good combination of unique and weird elements with an interesting society which breaks away from what may be deemed comfortable and usual.Topics wise there's a lot going on here, though I think the main ones have to do with power, sacrifice, and lack of communication, and the cost that comes with them. Loyalty is a constant dilemma particularly when it faces off against distrust and self-interest. Of course, religion plays a big part in here in both the shaping of civilization as well inner struggles from some characters. War and violence have their claws in just about every aspect of this society, it's not a pretty world and there's a constant struggle between what's necessary and excessive;\u00a0regularly\u00a0placed on a balance of individual vs. the benefit of the many. Plenty more to be found here, bravery vs. cowardice for one.I thought the collection of characters were great. Maybe a few were underused and not developed as much as I would've liked to see, but just a consequence of the novel really focusing on the POV of its two main characters, Nyx and the magician Rhys. But cool characters all around, and certainly multidimensional and they all serve their role in the events quite well.I can't recommend \nGod's War\n enough. Plenty to like here particularly if you're patient and not frustrate yourself when the events and narrative get a bit hard to follow. It's fresh and it should satisfy those that constantly complain that they keep reading more of the same. Above all for me, this is simply a kickass, fast moving, action packed novel with tough people going at each other, scheming and cutting heads. A very strong debut for Kameron Hurley, and congratulations on her Nebula nomination. Already read the sequel, \nInfidel\n, which was another great installment to the series. Anticipating eagerly the next one. Give them a try."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9822645-jon", "userReview": "A good, but flawed first novel, God\u2019s War has enough innovative and imaginative touches throughout it to make the author someone I\u2019ll read more of. Gritty and noirish, the book takes place in the far future on the harsh, colonized world of Umayma. The world is largely a desert planet and the two main countries, Chenja and Nasheen, have been embroiled in a Holy War for several centuries. The main character of the novel, Nyx, is violent, hard drinking, and not above being on the wrong side of the law. As an ex-soldier and an ex-government assassin turned bounty hunter, Nyx has the checkered past and moral ambiguity of the classic anti-hero. Nyx also has a well-developed sex drive and beds a number of willing women throughout the novel. Oh, and by the way, Nyx is female.In the novel, while females can volunteer to serve in the military, Nasheenian males are drafted and sent to the front once they become teenagers. They can come home when (and if) they live long enough to reach 40. Hurley extrapolates what effect perpetual war would have on a culture and has created a matriarchal society where males are in short supply on the home front. This, however, isn\u2019t a feminist Utopia, the women are just as violent and the female dominated government and other institutions are just as corrupt as ones run by males. I\u2019m sure the argument can be made against trying to emulate the worse qualities of men, but in the novel, Rosie the Riveter is a bad ass who\u2019ll beat you to a bloody pulp if you look at her the wrong way.Some of the highlights are:The Setting \u2013 the world building here is impressive. Umayma is a contaminated and ravaged world after centuries of warfare and Hurley adds a touch of innovation by making Umayma a world colonized by Muslims. Part of the conflict that gave rise to the war comes from the culture clash of the more pious Chenjans and the more progressive culture of the Nasheenians, but Hurley doesn\u2019t demonize either side for their stance. An important secondary character is Rhys, a Chenjan expatriate on Nyx\u2019s team, a pious and devout Muslim who is drawn sympathetically by Hurley.The Atmosphere \u2013 the book is noirish with many dark and macabre touches throughout it. For example, the repatriation of casualties becomes just another tactical move:\u201che stared out at the neatly numbered bags of the Chenjan dead, the ones the Nasheenians had taken from the field and planted with viruses to be trucked back into Chenja. These bodies would be stacked up and mixed in with the rest of Chenjan bodies pulled out of the field that day and then delivered back to Chenja, carrying tailored viruses and nests of bugs primed to burst after they reached a populated area\u201d.The world of Umayma is bleak and war torn, with the quiet shattered frequently with the sound of sirens announcing in-coming chemical and biological weapons and the countryside littered with the detritus of conflict:\u201cThe desert stayed flat and white all day. Rhys saw more evidence of recent fighting as they drove - spent bursts and abandoned artillery, black-scarred rents in the desert, pools of dead bugs. He saw a heap of burning corpses in the distance. He knew there were corpses because the giant scavengers were circling, despite the smoke: couple of sand cats, black swarms that must have been palm-sized carrion beetles, and some of the rarer flying scavenger beetles with hooked jaws, the kind that grew to over a meter long and had been known to devour children in their beds.\"The Tech \u2013 this is one of the book\u2019s strengths. Hurley has envisioned a world based upon bioorganic technology. Tailored bugs are used for food, energy, communication, weapons, etc, and Hurley does an amazing job developing this concept and creating a realistic society that would rely on this technology. If bugs make you squeamish, then the \u201cick\u201d factor will be high in more than a few scenesThe Flaws:The plot \u2013 if a book were a car and the plot the instrument that powers it, then this book is a Lamborghini with a 4 cylinder, \u201977 Pinto engine under the hood. The plot, or what little there is of one, doesn\u2019t kick in until about \u00bd through the book and it\u2019s fairly weak. There\u2019s also enough plot holes to drive a truck through. For example, the Chenjans are described as being racially distinct from the Nasheenians with black skin instead of the lighter skin the Nasheenians have, yet Nyx and several of her Nasheenian adversaries are able to wander around Chenja at one point without anybody becoming alarmed. I kept waiting for the Chenja internal security forces to swoop in and arrest everybody, but it never happened. It\u2019s comparable to a group of Americans wandering around Japan during WWII or Hanoi during the Vietnam war with nobody reacting to it. The weak plot is a shame since so much attention was given to other aspects of the story, but this is the first book in a trilogy, so maybe the following books can find a decent story to tell.Still, I\u2019d recommend the book to anyone who has read and liked any of Richard Morgan\u2019s Takeshi Kovacs novels. While the sex scenes aren\u2019t as explicit as those in Morgan\u2019s novels, the violence is. It was nominated for a couple of sci-fi awards and has enough good qualities to make it worth reading."}, {"userName": "Ranting Dragon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4367400-ranting-dragon", "userReview": "http://www.rantingdragon.com/gods-war...Kameron Hurley\u2019s stellar debut novel follows the bloody life of Nyxnissa, commonly called Nyx, a bel dame (government-funded bounty hunter) trying to survive in a world consumed by a holy war that\u2019s been raging for centuries. When she\u2019s relieved of her duties for doing black work of her own to earn extra cash for herself, she has to adapt and find a new way of living.To survive, Nyx has created a team of independent bounty-hunters that are willing to take any bounty that allows them to survive another day. Suddenly, she\u2019s summoned into the Queen\u2019s presence to accept a note that could retire her team from the business altogether. Charged with hunting down a missing alien who may be the key to solving the war in her country\u2019s favor, she risks her life, as well as the lives of her team, to capture the alien. In the process Nyx and her team are entangled in a spiral of chaos and political intrigue fueled by hatred and distrust.Strong CharactersJames \u2013 God\u2019s War accomplished what very few fantasy novels are able to do\u2014create believable and in-depth characters. Each character got his or her own story, and in each of those stories the reader is brought closer to what makes that character his or her own person. Truly, this is something that astounded me more than anything else in this novel, and it\u2019s something that deserves a great amount of applause. In the end, there were characters that I felt closer to than others, but they all had their strengths and weaknesses, and that\u2019s what made them such a pleasure to read.Caitrin \u2013 The characters were definitely one of the main strengths of the novel. Nyxnissa, our heroine, is not a character that is immediately likable or relatable. Though you may finish the novel disliking her, Nyx is a real character. She is complex; she isn\u2019t afraid to be anything but herself, she does what she wants when she wants, and she is willing to do whatever is necessary to accomplish her goals. Her character arc over the course of the novel is subtle but the changes in her character are always a result of her own will, never of circumstance or other people. Nyxnissa wasn\u2019t my favorite character but she was the most well-fleshed out character and the perfect heroine for the story.Masterful Cultural ParallelsJames \u2013 I was amazed with how well Kameron Hurley incorporated cultural parallels with our own world without turning the novel into her own political statement. The problems facing the planet of Umayma are similar to our own. Homosexuality is grudgingly accepted but still culturally despised, similar to how it\u2019s dealt with in many parts of our world. As well, Hurley\u2019s ability to transform the war into a character of its own is phenomenal. You can feel the war\u2019s oppressive hands clamping down on everyone in this novel, and shivers went down my spine as I realized the effects that war can have on people.Caitrin \u2013 The political connotations weren\u2019t as obvious for me as the religious parallels were. The history of the people who landed on Umayma has been lost in the sands of time as the different nations that populate the world were created thousands of years before the novel begins. In my mind, though, I could easily see this as a far-flung future where different followers of God escaped Earth and settled the world. The nations of Chenja and Nasheen had an Islamic feel, while Ras Tiegans and the aliens seemed to follow an evolution of Christianity. I\u2019d love to learn more about the beliefs of Mhoria and Tirhan. Religion is hugely important to all aspects of the novel as it pervades and influences everything. I loved creating theories as I read and learned more about the cultures of the countries of Umayma.Amazing World-BuildingJames \u2013 The world that God\u2019s War is set in is one vastly different from our own, yet still relatable on quite a few levels. There\u2019s a definite Islamic feel to the world, the two sects being divided into two countries\u2014Nasheen and Chenja\u2014and surrounding those two cultures are previously established civilizations that have been forced to deal with the intrusion of these new people on their homeland. I felt like every single culture was fleshed out beautifully, and because of that, the world was plausible and could be sustained for generations.Caitrin \u2013 Hurley definitely gives the impression that she knows every minute detail of Umayma and it gives the whole universe of the novel a rich and deep feel. She doesn\u2019t pull you out of the story by explaining things that the character would already know. This is a strength but it is also a weakness. You are thrown immediately into the world without a lifeline. I found myself scrambling to understand things like: What exactly is a burnous? Was a bakkie a bug, a vehicle or some weird mixture of both? Were the sisters chasing Nyx actually related to her? Maybe a dictionary in the back would have helped me. Once you get into the swing of things though, you are fully immersed in the story and world of Umayma and it\u2019s a fantastic read.Not a Page TurnerJames \u2013 This book was not a page-turner, and that was unfortunate. The world was written beautifully, and the story was definitely interesting, but I felt like there just wasn\u2019t enough suspense in this novel. There was no reason why I couldn\u2019t just stop at the end of a chapter to set it down for later.Caitrin \u2013 I agree that while the book is very well written, until the last third of the book, I could easily put it down and pick it up later. The ending for me, though, was stellar. The action and stakes ramped up and I spent three hours finishing the book because I couldn\u2019t put it down. I never felt cheated by how things turned out. Events didn\u2019t unfold like I thought they would and I was surprised by how emotional I became when a character died. I had to put the book down for a few seconds to fully absorb it. Nyx is never spared a bad experience because she is the heroine, and her story and the overall plot had a complete end. The story could have very well ended there, with the lives of the characters continuing on without the reader ever learning more. I was satisfied by the ending but I wanted more; I wanted to see what else happened in the lives of the characters. I was very happy to learn that two more novels are going to be published. Some of the threads of the story that weren\u2019t wrapped up into a neat bow will get resolution! I can\u2019t wait until December!Why should you read this book?While this isn\u2019t your standard fantasy novel, if you don\u2019t mind a sci-fi twist to your reading, then there is absolutely no reason why you shouldn\u2019t pick up this book. If you\u2019re looking for an interesting, fresh story that marries fantasy and science-fiction in an original way, then this is the book for you. This beautifully crafted novel is truly a work of art\u2014bloody, brutal, bug-filled art."}, {"userName": "Justin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1652081-justin", "userReview": "http://staffersmusings.blogspot.com/2...I salute\u00a0Night Shade Books. \u00a0Starting with Paolo Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl two years ago, they've been been pumping out quality debuts. \u00a0This year alone Night Shade released an incredible portfolio of new authors that have been consistently well received (you can visit a nice chunk of them at\u00a0http://night-bazaar.com/). \u00a0God's War from Kameron Hurley is very much in this tradition albeit in a novel that ignores genre tradition with impunity.God's War is a second world fantasy novel written in a technologically advanced society. \u00a0On her twitter feed last (@nkjemisin) week Hugo Nominated Author N.K. Jemisin asked about whether technology predisposed classification as science fiction in lieu of fantasy. \u00a0If I was making an argument that technology and fantasy aren't mutually exclusive, Hurley's novel would be the example I hold up. \u00a0She introduces lots of technology - firearms, cars, spacecraft, wireless communication, among others. \u00a0The twist is, nearly all of this technology functions through a \"mystical\" connection between gifted humans (called... wait for it... magicians!) who utilize insects as a power source.Hurley's plot centers around a woman named Nyxnissa and her unlucky team of bounty hunters headlined by the not so talented magician, Rhys. \u00a0Set in a world where competing religious factions (both of which \"feel\" a lot like Islam) have been at war for generations, all men are required to serve at the front. \u00a0Those that refuse become fair game for teams like Nyx's to be hunted down, killed, and turned in for monetary reward. \u00a0When the queens calls Nyx's number for a very particular bounty she and her team drop everything to get back on top.What makes God's War such an accomplishment has little to do with its plot. \u00a0In fact, the early going of the narrative is rather disjointed with blanks that could use filling. \u00a0Things are never real clear as to why Nyx's team is so loyal to her and the relationships between Nyx and the various arms of the government lack an equal amount of lucidity. \u00a0What rescues the novel and makes it such a great read are wonderfully drawn characters and original unexpected world building.To the first point, Hurley's primary characters are the aforementioned Nyx and Rhys. \u00a0Her plot flows around these two as they struggle to survive, their relationship to the war-torn world around them, and ultimately their relationship to each other. \u00a0Nyx is about as hard boiled a female as I've ever seen - somewhat\u00a0reminiscent\u00a0of Joe Abercrombie's Monza from Best Served Cold. \u00a0Unlike Abercrombie's version of the tough female, Nyx comes off authentic; less a force of nature, and more irrecoverably broken by the life she's led. \u00a0Somehow she retains humanity and a modicum of vulnerability that strikes the perfect tone in her interactions with Rhys who functions as the literary foil to Nyx. \u00a0Where she is all hard edges, Rhys is softer and more vulnerable hiding the hard edges from view. \u00a0It makes for a poignant juxtaposition that excels from beginning to end.The world Nyx and Rhys inhabit is just as poignant. \u00a0Couched in real world terms God's War provides a look not so dissimilar from what might go on in the Middle East if everyone gave up the hope of peace. \u00a0While both sides of the war worship the same God and read from the same book, their interpretations are night and day. Nyx's side has become matriarchal, sacrificing the entire male population as fodder on the front lines. The other remains patriarchal with a continued practice of marginalizing women despite the massive exportation of men to the front.Umayma, the planet on which this all takes place, is an anathema to human life as the war itself. \u00a0Cancer is rampant among those lacking the means to prevent it and ethnic minorities are discarded. \u00a0But for a very brief scene in the middle pages,\u00a0God's War\u00a0never takes us to war itself. \u00a0The novel's focus is instead on the war at home - how it impacts those who come back broken and those who were never allowed to go. \u00a0Interestingly, this is not a sentimental book that beats the drum about the pointlessness of war. \u00a0Hurley sets the stage, moves her beautiful characters across it, and leaves the reader to draw their own conclusions.While there are certainly some narrative hiccups indicative of its status as a debut novel, God's War is a clever reinterpretation of the war novel. \u00a0Hurley takes on issues of gender roles, violence, and religion and does it all with a deft hand. \u00a0I sincerely hope it receives some well deserved attention come award season and I strongly suggest my readers check this one out.The sequel to God's War is coming out next month, titled Infidel. \u00a0I already have my hands on it so expect a review in a week or two."}, {"userName": "Kaitlin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19126246-kaitlin", "userReview": "This book was the first one I picked up as part of the 2015 Booktubeathon and I have to say it's well worth reading. This is a debut book by Kameron Hurley and whilst I haven't ever read anything by Hurley before now I had heard a lot about the originality and uniqueness of her ideas and concepts. Having now read her debut (which is the first in a series and one that I want to continue with) I can certainly say that Hurley does have a great way of coming up with original ideas that I had never seen done before.This book focuses on a character called Nyx (what a cool name, may I just say) who is a Bel Dame and her team of Mercenaries. A Bel Dame is basically an elite assassin in this world, but this world is anything but normal. On the world of the Bel Dames there's a war raging between two nations. It's a war which is called the God's War and thus religion (and particularly Islamic beliefs) seem to take centre stage and be very prominent worries and concerns for may of our characters. We follow Nyx as she and her team are forced to find a missing individual, but along the way we find out a lot about their pasts, their secrets, their beliefs and their (absurd) world. It's an adventure, a battle and a never ending war. It's certainly exciting!The elements I found most interesting in this book were the world-building elements. Hurley has managed to create an alien world which runs off of Bug-powered technology and features magicians, assassins, gender-divisions and interesting characters. All of these elements are pretty balanced when you do get into the story (after about the first 50pgs) but it's certainly a bit of an experience to get used to it. I found myself believing in the world more the further through I went because Hurley, although very imaginative with the world-building, has it all worked out so well it feels convincing. I also liked that we had some focus on boxing (something Hurley is apparently interested in and has a past with) and magicians (something I love in fantasy). It's never truly clear quite whether there is 'magic' in the conventional sense within this story or whether it's more genetic engineering so this is certainly a blurring the lines of Sci-fi and Fantasy. I highly enjoyed the Bug-magic-craziness throughout though!On the whole I would say that this is probably not a book everyone will like because it takes a while to get to grips with it all and feel fully immersed but it is a fast-paced and highly original read. I would recommend it if what I've described appeals to you, and I gave this a solid 4* rating. I will certainly be looking out for the next few books in the series some time soon :)"}, {"userName": "Ian", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2741551-ian", "userReview": "[doomed romances, that make them behave more like high school students than life-hardened bounty hunters (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "I never expected to like this book. Never, ever.I stay far away from war-themed books. Even desert war in a post-apocalyptic landscape. Oh wait, post-apocalyptic? No, war negates it.Then this was nominated for a Nebula, and I only had three nominees for best novel left to read. Then I realized at some point last year, I downloaded it on my Nook app, probably free or some sale. So I didn't even need to find it; I owned it. No more excuses. I was impressed. It was something different! It takes this world where bugs take the place of things that electricity and batteries used to do, and then some. Lights. Security. Cameras. Medicine. Vaccination. Tracking. Explosive terrorist virus bugs. Wow, there are just bugs everywhere. They are described as crawling and dripping and being more pervasive (and possibly genetically/nuclearly altered) than you could ever fathom. In that sense this is not a book for the squeamish.I loved the kick-ass main character of Nyx. The same-sex relationships and gender role reversals were refreshing and worked really well, within a somewhat familiar context of different interpretations of civil and religious customs and law. Then there is magic. And... bug work. It is hard to explain, but handled well. I might even be tempted to read the next book.Do I think it will win the Nebula award? No! I think it is too specialized and different. But I'd love to see that happen to turn the award on its ear.A few samples:(setting)\"He saw old contagion sensors sticking up from the desert, half buried, some of them with the red lights at their bulbous tips still blinking. There were fewer old cities in the Chenjan Khairian wasteland, where the first world had been created and abandoned.\"(these are not normal bugs!)\"The desert stayed flat and white all day. Rhys saw more evidence of recent fighting as they drove - spent bursts and abandoned artillery, black-scarred rents in the desert, pools of dead bugs. He saw a heap of burning corpses in the distance. He knew there were corpses because the giant scavengers were circling, despite the smoke: couple of sand cats, black swarms that must have been palm-sized carrion beetles, and some of the rarer flying scavenger beetles with hooked jaws, the kind that grew to over a meter long and had been known to devour children in their beds.\"*shudder*(kickass)\"'You didn't make me,' Nyx gasped. 'I made myself.'\""}, {"userName": "Joel", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8809317-joel", "userReview": "I went into this book with very, very high hopes - Kameron has gained a pretty great reputation as a \"very dark\" writer, and while I read this description as an urban fantasy, I still had pretty high expectations. I will say that I don't qualify it as an \"urban fantasy\" as I generally count urban fantasy as being 'fantasy occurring in modern day earth', which this story is not. I will also say that the subject matter of the story is very dark, and that the characters and dialogue fit the dark mold for sure.That said, it didn't do as much for me as I'd hoped.Nyx is a hardened assassin in a world where winning fights and being tough is a necessity, and is put into a position where she is essentially forced to take on an assassin job from the queen - one that she basically needs to take to clear herself from past problems. However, as she goes about the mission, she finds a lot about how the world works, about the inner workings of the politics of her world, and about herself and her companions.I will agree that God's War is dark - the subject matter is morbid at best, and downright dark at worst. Dialogue is gritty and edgy. At the end, however, I felt like it was forced - the cussing and sexuality all felt a bit arbitrary, like the entire world was written just as an excuse to be edgy and sexual. I appreciate dark, 'realistic' worlds - ala Abercrombie, Lawrence, etc. I don't, however, feel the need to cuss and have sex at every turn, which seems to be a general theme in Hurley's worlds. Every chapter brings edge in the form of profanity and sex, rather than in a feeling of 'reality' or hrashness. Overall, the positives are there; the world is unique, and with some great worldbuilding. I actually liked Hurley's prose - it was smooth, professional and polished, and really made me want to enjoy this world more than I do. I just could not get into it at all, no matter how hard I tried. I wanted to like it, but in the end, I just found myself disinterested and not remotely enthralled with continuing the series."}, {"userName": "Joseph", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5004971-joseph", "userReview": "To start with, we have a great opening line: \"Nyx sold her womb somewhere between Punjai and Faleen, on the edge of the desert.\"Nyx is a former bel dame -- kind of a state-sponsored assassin -- now eking out a living (barely) as a freelance bounty hunter. The world is a backwater -- an inhospitable, relatively low-tech desert world (at least, we seem to spend most of our time in desert areas) where what technology they have seems to be based on the harnessing of (genetically modified?) insects -- one of Nyx's team members, Rhys, is actually a magician, which in this case means someone who can use his own pheromones to control the insects. There's a war that's been going on for as long as anyone can remember, that's half wrecked the planet and that keeps chewing up and spitting out the population of the belligerent countries.Things get off to a bit of a slow start, but once the main story kicked in, about 25% of the way into the book, I had trouble putting it down.This is not a particularly cheery or light-hearted book -- the story (like Nyx herself) is harsh, occasionally brutal, but not without flashes of humor or of heart. The world is fascinating -- with a distinctly Middle Eastern flavor, but heavily dominated by females (since most of the males are being sent off to the war as soon as they turn of age); and the bug tech is intriguing.Will definitely be continuing on to the second & third books in the trilogy."}, {"userName": " Danielle The Book Huntress (Back to the Books)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 21, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1570669-danielle-the-book-huntress-back-to-the-books", "userReview": "Dark, disturbing, brutal, fascinating.

Maybe starting with her first book wasn't the best approach ...The writing is just fine, and the characterization and world-building are excellent. I suspect others more affected have commented on the cultural appropriation issues, which made me a little uncomfortable. Mostly, though, I just found the whole thing too violent, in the way contemporary TV shows intend to be violent--long, loving emphasis on blood, pain, and the moral imperative to do gruesome things in the service of some kind of long-term, hazy moral good. And finally, the book has a rather unlikely central \"romance\" (or at least wannabe romance) which is almost certainly going to drive the later books in the series. I had to drag myself through lots of this one--I finished it because of the characterization, and the really good feminist underpinnings. I don't like feeling \"phew\" when I finish a book, and that's where this one left me. I hope to try Hurley again some time, with later work in a different milieu."}, {"userName": "Regina", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3104032-regina", "userReview": "This is not a full review as I read this books months ago, it is sort of a remembering. I just learned it is a nominee for the 2011 Nebula Awards, so I thought the book deserved some write up. This book and the world written about in this book is unlike anything else I have ever read. The world building was fantastic and so unique. Magic and technology run on bugs. Control of bugs gives individuals more power. The society is devoid of men because they are at war; fighting has been going on for centuries. As the result of war society of both countries fighting has been devistated socially and environmentally. Each country at war has reacted differently. One is oppresive to women and the other country, due to the lack of men, is oppressive to men. But that is a simplistic description of the social dynamics in this book, it is much more complex. What is clear in this story is that war is devistating and the violence in people's lives destroys their humanity. The setting is in a desert like location reminscent of the middle east, but it appears to be a planet settled centuries ago. The story told is a dark, brutal story. There is not much light in it. There is no love, no romance, there is loyalty among team members -- but the team members themselves are brutal and cruel people. I have purchased her next book in this series and do plan to read it.If you can handle dark and brutal (and I mean brutal) stories and enjoy complex world building, then you likely would enjoy this story. It is not for those who are squeamish about bugs, violence or if same-sex sexual relationships bother you."}, {"userName": "Aleksandra", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40511295-aleksandra", "userReview": "God's War is the first book in science-fiction fantasy series, set in spectacular and complex world at war. This is multi-layered and dark story, with unlikable non-heroes, violence, deaths and dying hopes to change the world, or rather prevent the world from stumbling into pits of hell.The world-building is without doubt the best thing about this novel. I have never read a book set in a world like that. The events take place on the planet Umayma in vaguely post-Earth time. Nasheen and Chenja have been at war so long they don't remember why it's started. They call it God's war because they believe they are doing it for God (spoiler alert, it's all about power and control). Both countries has islam-inspired religion. There are muezzins, mullahs, women wearing veils & hijabs, five prayers per day etc. However, these countries have interpreted the religion very drastically over the years. They consider Kibat the main book of God, however political and social situation in their countries couldn't be more different.Nasheen is a monarchy and matriarchal society with queen as the head of the country. Fascinating that, they send boys and men at war, men can't be allowed to come back until the serve at the front, while all the positions of power are held by women. I find it very interesting that men have traditionally to our society \"warrior\" roles but they are mostly reduced to numbers of dead and dying on the front. The reproduction system is highly organized, all women have some kind of vaccines to prevent unplanned pregnancies, the special group of \"breeders\" is responsible for keeping up the population level. In Nasheen women/women relationships are seen normal due to general lack of male populace in the country, however men/men relationships are illegal and punished by death.Chenja is democracy with elected mullahs to govern the country (I would call the system oligarchy because only the few people can be elected). Chenjan are more pious than Nasheenians. Chenjans are very strictly with their \"submission to God\". It's a patriarchal society, women are seen as property and means to enlarge the population. Men can have multiple wives, women aren't allowed to talk with men who aren't relative. Men are fighting on the front, but due to tradition the eldest son is to remain in the family to become the next family leader.Apart from Chenja and Nasheen there are other countries. Mhoria with deeply segregated society by sex, Ras Tieg filled with prejudice and violence against shifters, Tirhan which we know little about. In the war between Nasheen and Chenja these countries don't take sides but they sell weapons and god's know what else.I find it crucial that neither of the countries are fallen into evil state or good state patterns. All of them have their ups and downs, nothing in this story is black or white. I love this realistic take.I don't usually go into such lengthy descriptions of the world-building and I haven't mention even the half of it. The dynamics in the society caused by this unusual roles and islam-based religion system make the book a truly remarkable read.(The story mostly takes place in Nasheen so we get to discover it more than any other states). Moreover, Nasheenians and Chenjans are poc, Nasheenians are brown and Chenjans are black, other nations aren't white either, except Mhorians, I believe. Isn't it refreshing to read a book with non-western-inspired setting?The intricate world-building is enriched by fantastical and sci-fi elements. The technology is insect-based, they made fuels from bugs, they make communication devices, organic fabrics and weaponry from bugs and people who have affinity to control insects are called magicians. Also there are shifters, people who able to shift into animals or birds. The society has evolved medicine, for example, it's possible to grow and attach fingers or say kidney if you happen to lose your own. This development leads to gene pirates, who buy bio-materials to do god's know what. It's just the first book, we don't know a whole lot.Oh and there are human aliens from space who fight their own God's war.I adore the complexity of this world, but it's a very brutal and grim and godless place, beware of that when you go into this book.In this lovely world we follow the crew of bounty hunters, located in Nasheen. The leader and the main character of the novel is Nyx, thirty-two year old, bisexual bounty hunter, she's ex-vet, she's not against numbing the pain with alcohol, drugs and sex with various individuals. The other main character is Rhys, refugee from Chenja, intelligent polyglot black man in his twenties, mediocre magician and a very pious man. Nyx and Rhys are completely different, she's atheist, he's devoted believer, they don't see eye to eye on anything but somehow they are pulled together. Nyx's other crew members are Taite from Ras Tieg, queer man in his twenties who has a pregnant sister, shifter Khos from Mhoria and Anneke. I honestly don't know much about Anneke, she has been in prison multiple times and she hoards weapons.The main plot is focused on their search for a runaway alien. As you can imagine things didn't go well for them or their quest, this is a very brutal world and a rather dark story.Despite having the best of times reading and discussing what I've read, I have several criticisms.The plot hasn't actually started until 30-40% into the book, at parts the story has been convoluted and unbalanced with either too much happening or too little. The resolution of the story left me wanting more and it all happened to fast for my taste. While I do see the potential for sequels, this novel as it is, does not require a sequel, I hoped there would be more obvious ground material for the next book, but of course I'm reading the sequels, it's out of question.The other thing that bothered me is transophobic language. Phrases like \"both genders\" have been frequent. I find it bewildering that in the book, which addresses gender roles and discusses gender at such length, does not address transgender individuals or non-binary individuals. The author talks about homophobia, racism, prejudices and danger of unbalanced society, but nothing has been said about trans folks in the said society, no main or secondary or any trans character. And the language of equating gender and sex is saddening.All in all, God's War is fantastic sci-fi fantasy novels, that talks about religion, race, war, this is a book with unlikable and morally dubious cast of characters and unforgettable world that I want to come back to and discover more of it.Content warning: violence, gore, death, abuse, torture, homophobia, racism, sexual assault, institutional violence"}], "description": "Nyx had already been to hell.
