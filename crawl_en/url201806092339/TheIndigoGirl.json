There are several things that I really liked about this book. While this is a fictionalized account of the life of Eliza Lucas, it not only appears to be well researched, but excerpts of letters written by Eliza Lucas are interspersed throughout. Eliza Lucas was a determined, smart and tough woman who was in many ways, a woman ahead of her times. How heartening to know that in spite of the societal demands of the times, that there were women who were bold enough to do things considered to be only in the realm of men. She is remembered for bringing to SC the indigo crop that changed its economy.The author in her notes tells which characters are based on real people and which are imagined. I always love to hear what the creative spark was that prompts an author to write a particular story. In this case, Natasha Rosenfeldt Boyd was attending an indigo exhibit in South Carolina and overheard a conversation between the gallery owner and one of Eliza's descendants. \"I caught snippets of a story that would light a fire in me. It was a story about a sixteen-year-old girl who ran her father's plantations in her father's name. \"This girl,\" the unknown person said next to me, unaware of my eavesdropping, \" made a deal with her slaves : she would teach them to read, and in return they would teach her the secrets of making indigo.\" And thus the spark for this novel and the story of this young woman whose story is inspiring and relevant even today.

Living in South Carolina in the 18th Century, she must oversee the running of the Lucas family plantations including three tracts of land. Each plantation is run by a manager who oversees slaves as they work to plant and harvest crops in order to turn a profit. Eliza's father, nicknamed Big Lucas, has returned to Antigua, the family's original domicile, in order to advance his military career. Debt has accrued in his military venture and only successful crop production will keep the family afloat in South Carolina..Eliza is no stranger to the running of the family enterprise. She has routinely assisted Big Lucas in recording family transactions. She is not the child of choice for this operation, however, her two brothers are away at school. The plan is for Eliza to keep the business solvent until her elder brother George can assume the reins. Eliza does not believe in convention, she believes in individual freedom. Women should not be chattel to be married off to unburden the family. Eliza will not settle for being a figurehead for the plantation...but...how will she be successful? Two of her plantations are heavily mortgaged to support her father's military aspirations.Eliza is determined to grow indigo. Indigo is a weed that has been grown with limited success in Antigua. Perhaps it can grow in South Carolina soil. She enlists the help of neighbor and botanist Mr. Deveaux and family friend, lawyer Charles Pinckney, as well as trusted slaves Quash, Togo, and Sawney. Indigo is difficult to produce. Success is unlikely. Frost can destroy indigo seeds. Indigo stalks must be cut at the exact hour of their potency and before they flower. She is embarking upon an uphill battle.Eliza Lucas is a teenager ahead of her time. While her mother worries about making a good match for her daughter, Eliza wants a husband who will treat her as an equal. She believes in compassion. Her slaves live in cabins free from draft, a dwelling has been built to serve as a schoolhouse and she has taught Quash and others to read. Her kindness has won her respect. There are those, however, who do not want Eliza to succeed and will thwart her efforts on a continual basis.\"The Indigo Girl\" by Natasha Boyd is a remarkable historical account of a girl's determination to introduce indigo as a staple crop in South Carolina.

Always the same since I was a child. Sometimes threatening. Sometimes euphoric. Breathing in deeply, I fancied the day held the weight of destiny.\u201d\nThus begins Natasha Boyd\u2019s \nThe Indigo Girl.\nThis is a story of conspiracy and deception, love and romance, ambition and sacrifice, secret alliances and betrayal, of intimidation and trust. Trust given and trust earned. A story of free men and slaves, of a young women who dared to insist on her right to choose to marry, or not, who dared to assert herself as a woman as competent as the men who tried to intimidate her. A woman who dared to choose her path in life in Colonial-era South Carolina. Eliza Lucas was a woman who dared to be kind to her childhood friend from Antigua; a friend who returns to her life as a slave owned by the man her father has sent to teach her the ways of growing indigo and turning it into dye.This would be a wonderful historical, fictional, story, a story that would inspire many, but what makes this an exceptionally moving and inspirational story is that Eliza Lucas lived and breathed, was a real woman who became known as the woman who changed agriculture in South Carolina. The Indigo Girl.In the South Carolina of old, young sixteen-year-old Eliza Lucas is left in charge of her family\u2019s plantations, her father has left in order to further enhance his position with the military, and has returned to Antigua, leaving Eliza, her mother and her younger sister there. It hasn\u2019t been that long since he brought his wife and daughter to this plot of land seventeen miles outside of Charles Town, six by water originally purchased by her father\u2019s father. Her two brothers are attending school in England, but in a few years, her brother George will be able to take over for her.Eliza has had a formal education in a finishing school in England when she was younger, but she was encouraged from a young age to seek out more knowledge, to read, to follow her inquisitive nature. One of her interests was botany.She has plans, which include a grove of oak trees with an eye to future ships needing the wood, but she is drawn to the indigo plant. She remembers the clothing she saw back in Antigua, and when she sees two women wearing skirts of that same rich blue when in town, she decides to look into growing indigo. A plant notoriously difficult to grow in South Carolina, subject to many failures in growing and many more failures in the process of being turned into dye.Based on an immense amount of research including many historical documents and Eliza Lucas\u2019 own letters\u2014excerpts of some are included in this story\u2014this is the story of a woman who was so highly regarded that, upon her death, George Washington requested to serve as a pallbearer at her funeral.

The year was 1730 when there were both Indian and slave uprisings. Her father returns to Antigua and has great military ambitions also wishing to become the governor of Antigua. He mortgages these plantations, unbeknownst to Eliza, because he is in need of money. Eliza, a strong willed brilliant daughter, resolves to make the plantation she and her family reside on, a success. The way she decides to do so is in the production of indigo. Her mother wishes for her to fail so that the family can return to England so she offers little to no support and actually thwarts Eliza's efforts.Eliza, a botanist at heart, is helped by a neighbor botanist, a gentlemen lawyer, and her slaves who knew the secret of indigo extraction. They strive to make a go of it. Eliza is the epitome of courage and determination. She will get what she wants and entices the slaves to share their indigo secrets by promising to teach them how to read, something that was against the law. She forms hidden attachments to her slaves, spurns those who are against her, and sacrifices everything to make this dream of hers come true. Along the way Eliza is met with many adversities but through the support of a man who she will eventually marry and her slaves who she treats with fairness and concern, she succeeds. Her indomitable spirit at such a young age makes her a woman of that fosters admiration, strength, and resilience.This novel is based on letters from Eliza and other historical documents. Through Eliza, her eventual husband, and the slaves, she is able to lay the foundation for the indigo industry that will eventually become one of the largest exports from South Carolina. It was quite an incredible book to read and enjoy as this little known figure in history came alive in this novel. Incredibly interesting is that no one really has heard of her exploits as she played a major role in the route that US history eventually took. Mentioned in the author's notes was that President George Washington was a pall bearer at her funeral. Eliza was a independent woman hundreds of years before that came into vogue. Her achievements, given that it was 1730's and was a woman need to be both admired and made know so that all women know that no matter what constraints that are placed upon them, having the will and the determination to succeed they will eventually do just that."}, {"userName": "Irene Sim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31914348-irene-sim", "userReview": "[I can justify their friendship, but I think her romantic fantasies about Ben and her stalker-ish - jealous behavior was a little farfetched for the time and place.

Have you ever read a book out of your normal comfort zone? Like one that isn't remotely what you would normally read but you ended up LOVING IT all the same???\n\n\u275dIt was so unlike me, but yet, it was me. Something was unfurling within me from behind the fear of societal expectations. Something true and deep. A part of my soul I'd always known was there but never acknowledged. I knew I'd never completely stop playing the role assigned to me in this life, but I would never ever let it compromise me.\u275e\n\n'The Indigo Girl' by Author Natasha Boyd was PHENOMENAL! There was so much passion within the pages of this book that my heart ached! ACHED!This is not a typical romance, so don't go into this book expecting that. But 'The Indigo Girl' was filled with passion; passion for life, for love and humanity. It was a story filled with guarded intimacy, and forbidden love, a story that reminds you what it is to be human! And this piece of fiction is BASED ON A TRUE STORY!!! It was incredibly inspiring.Based on true life, 'The Indigo Girl' tells the story of Eliza Pickney. At 16, her father leaves her in charge of his plantations in the Carolinas. Her two brothers (the rightful heirs at that time) were away at school in England. So when her father had to return to Antigua, it was just Eliza, her mother, and younger sister. The family needed a Hail Mary to survive while her father was gone. They could not sustain all of the plantations they owned and her father's commission. It was up to 16-year-old Eliza to find a way to financially sustain her family.Indigo.One day while touring one of her families plantations, Eliza sees clothing on the women that reminds her of the Indigo her beloved Ben used to make. Having grown to love horticulture, she wondered if she could grow Indigo, there, in South Carolina. And if she could, would this be what saved her family?Not having seen her friend in many years, Eliza petitions her father to send Ben to teach her how to grow Indigo. Her father denies her request. Both for Eliza's reputation and the safety of her friend. Ben is the first friend Eliza made as a young girl and grew to be her best friend. He was also a slave. So Eliza presses on, she studies and asks questions. She befriends people and slaves who have experience growing seeds similar to Indigo as well as those who have knowledge of Indigo.Eliza was put in a precarious position. On the one hand, her father left her in charge of plantations and slaves. Her father wanted her to save the family of financial ruin or at the very least, keep the family afloat until her brother came of age and could take over in her father's place.On the other, her mother was dead set on marrying her off. Women weren't celebrated for their knowledge, this was a time when women didn't have power or a voice. Her mother didn't understand Eliza's exuberance, her independence, nor her strong sense of self. Eliza wanted to work. She was strong willed and had opinions. As a 16-year-old female, men were more interested in patting her on the head or dismissing her entirely than they were with accepting that she might be intelligent enough to make good decisions. Her value and worth were only what she could bring to a marriage and how she could provide for her husband.\n\n\u275dThis was perhaps my only chance to show my father I was destined for more than being some man's wife. Perhaps one day. But not yet. What was wrong with being a spinster anyway?\u275e\n\nI so admire Eliza Pickney. She had a strong sense of right and wrong. Her fortitude was admirable. She was strong before her time. Had she been born today, she would have been celebrated for her ideas and her intelligence.This story evoked a myriad of emotions in me. I cried from sadness and I cried from anger. But I also gained a sense of appreciation for how far our gender has come!I first read this author when she penned 'Eversea', and the follow-up book, 'Forever, Jack'. I liked those well enough. But 'The Indigo Girl' was a superb! I am so happy that Natasha Boyd felt compelled to tell the story of such an amazing woman. While parts may be fiction, it is clear that Ms. Boyd did her research.Phenomenal! Exquisite! Passionate!

I will keep this fairly short but also aim to explain my thoughts and feelings. This is not romance, I would consider this straight historical fiction which might confuse other Natasha Boyd fans as she is known for successful contemporary romance. This wasn\u2019t a problem for me per se, but there were two different strands of suggestion of romance and both of these storylines lacked depth and execution for my taste.The story of a strong young woman coming of age with huge responsibility was an interesting concept and I wanted to be engaged but a slow start made investment difficult. I felt more pulled in at 25% and I found Eliza\u2019s botanical endeavours initially interesting but eventually less so in the long run. The stories of the slaves were my favourite thing about this book. On the whole, I wanted more excitement in terms of storyline and a little more in character development.Whilst this book wasn\u2019t eventually what I expected or wanted, I\u2019m sure some will enjoy this tale, the setting and colours it conjures.

It made me want to find out even more about Eliza's life. I'm so fascinated by her right now.I absolutely loved Eliza. And they way the author wrote her. Eliza was ahead of her time and I just loved her courage and ambition and how in the end she never did give up on making indigo dye, even though people kept telling her she wouldn't be able to and even sabotaged her.

We seem to want to tug on these journeys until their story unravels. Indigo Girl is a mostly true story. Eliza, our lead gal, was a women of not even 17 living in the American colonies in mid-1700s. The primary purpose of the story appears to be about Eliza but I actually think (based on the afterword); that this is really a story about indigo production and how to get by in the mid-1700s. The perseverance and no quit attitude portrayed by Eliza in The Indigo Girls is something I think anyone can admire and wish for; regardless of time period or gender.As it's the mid-1700s on a plantation in what would later become South Carolina; inevitably much of the book is about slavery. Eliza was a very progressive woman for her time and truly loved her slaves like family. This caused her a lot of heartache but also meant she fought hard for her slaves and treated them well. At one point I did get tired of how 'special' Eliza was that she saw her slaves as real people instead of, well, slaves. I suppose that is because to us, today, it seems so obvious that everyone should be seen and treated equally. This was the largest annoyance I had in Indigo Girl is that it got a bit repetitive about Eliza's special bond with the slaves. However, without a doubt Eliza's love for anyone with a good heart is what makes this a poignant and sometimes sad story. Especially the elements of it that are definitely true. Natasha Boyd makes a point at the end of letting the reader know what characters were fiction and which were real people. In a historical book built on truth I always appreciate this. There's also a bibliography if you want to read more about Eliza. I love that most of the letters are quoted direct from Eliza's real life letters. I would highly recommend The Indigo Girl for anyone that loves historical stories; but also to those with a keen interest in some of the building blocks of the future that people in the USA laboured so hard to create.

Moreover, I also loved how this story is an example that innovation and forward thinking can sometimes come from the least expected of sources, and that one should never give up trying to better one's lot and the lot of others in your life.\u00a0 Please note that for those that are familiar with my reviews, this is not a traditional historical romance.\u00a0 It is historical fiction based on an interpretation of true events.\u00a0 That said, there are romance elements and a HEA which is sure to satisfy the romance enthusiast while at the same time being an intriguing and top-rate historical fiction that is based in part on true events.Eliza Lucas, the eldest child of an owner of several plantations in South Carolina is only 16 years old when her father returns to Antigua, leaving her in charge of the heavily mortgaged properties. As a result, Eliza is in quite a quandary. If Eliza is successful in making the plantations profitable, they will undoubtedly be handed over to her brother once he comes from England, as women did not inherit property in her day and age. If she is unsuccessful, there will be nothing left of the home she has come to love. Moreover, Eliza struggles with the cultural issues of the day. Believing that slaves should be freed, even as she struggles with tending her lands with the slaves that live on her plantations. Fortunately, for them all, Eliza gets an idea from her time in Antigua, and given the popularity of the indigo dye, to try and plant indigo in South Carolina. They even go so far as to hire a consultant. Unfortunately, for Eliza there are many apparent and hidden obstacles in the way to her achieving her dream of learning how to adapt the indigo crops so that they can grow in South Carolina. Even as she encounters obstacle after obstacle with the help of a childhood friend (a slave who is apprenticed to the indigo crop consultant) and a family lawyer friend, she never gives up even when success appears dismal.Ultimately, however, can a 16 year-old girl triumph in the face of all of this adversity?The pleasing narration by Saskia Maarleveld is simply icing on the cake of a memorable, touching story. Having previously listened to and enjoyed Ms. Maarleveld, I knew I was in for a treat. Ms. Maarleveld was perfect for this role as she is able to produce both genuine American and British accents, which was necessary for this story with characters of both heritages. Ms. Maarleveld is also able to deepen her voice sufficiently to produce believable male characters. This has the added advantage that it makes it easy to differentiate the characters that are speaking. Ms. Maarleveld even is able to make the characters sound younger or older depending on the individual characteristics penned by Ms. Boyd. In fact, just from Ms. Maarleveld's voice, I could tell who the villains of the story were. The narration is simply fantastic, bringing the story to life which allowed me to sit back and further enjoy this great story.All in all, if you enjoy historical fiction, and have any interest in the American colonial era, particularly the plantations of the South, then I highly recommend that you listen to The Indigo Girl. This is also a must-listen for any historical romance lovers who appreciate a strong heroine with an indomitable spirit.Source: Review copy provided for review purposes."}, {"userName": "Aura", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9936091-aura", "userReview": "Eliza Lucas is a 16 year old who is left in charge of a slave owning plantation while her father goes off to Antigua to tend to other matters.

Knowing that this young girl had the gumption to push forward with her beliefs and who in the end is a big part of history made this story even more powerful because who doesn't love reading about a strong woman who stands up for what she believes in. <3"}, {"userName": "Andi (A Literal Hottie)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3614628-andi-a-literal-hottie", "userReview": "Indigo Girl is based on the true story of Eliza Lucas, the author even included excerpts from her letters in the 1730s adding a wonderfully authentic touch. The novel starts off slowly but before you have time to notice you are engulfed in the story and you'll find yourself captivated by something as random as the production of indigo.

Days I have thought about this determined girl who dreamed so big and had her hopes dashed so brutally, but still, somehow, prevailing in the end. But perhaps it is the way in which the author told this remarkable story that had me spellbound.  The Negroes were singing. Light danced over the dark, inky ocean, and I blinked my eyes awake. No ocean. Just the faint blue of a breaking day casting over the walls of my bedchamber. A dream still clung damp to my bones. Always the same since I was a child. Sometimes threatening, sometimes euphoric. Breathing in deeply, I fancied the day held the weight of destiny.  Eliza Lucas was only sixteen when her father left her to oversee their plantations to pursue his military ambitions in the year 1739, and in a new world no less, a place she had not grown up. Such responsibility for someone her age and her gender. But this is precisely why her story was so fascinating to me. There were so many obstacles standing in her way, so many prejudices. But this could have easily have been a dry to the bone telling like so many stories we endured sitting in our history classes. But that is not what we got here. No. We got a deeply emotional story filled with love and heart and betrayal and loss and hope and regret. It's all here. And while it's not a romance it is a love story. An agape kind of love - that stretches out and touches everyone she encounters. Well, minus the villains in this story, and yes there are villains as there are in real life. People whom seek to destroy others for their own gains. Her own mother I count among them. But I'd rather talk about Eliza and her ability to punch through societal norms with a closed fist and a smile. There was one scene in particular that I laughed out loud, punched the air, and wished for a fictional time machine so I could be standing there to give Eliza the 'high five' she so deserved. My goodness, I girl crushed on her for days after that scene. If you want to read about a woman who took on the world, who did so with polite grace, an easy smile, charm and wit... if you want to read about a woman who had heart, compassion, love for the human spirit, and used it to make not only her life better, but the slaves lives better as well, than you need to read this book. If you are like me...searching for inspiration in a world that seems so lacking of it, then I think you'll have the same deep appreciation for this story. To the author...thank you for introducing me to Eliza. I am richer for having met her."}, {"userName": "Jess", "userReviewDate": "Dec 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6928164-jess", "userReview": "I wanted to love this book, but it was just ok. The history of Eliza Lucas Pinckney is so fascinating, but this author chose to spend a whole lot of time on her imagined inner romantic thoughts about the men in her life instead of focusing on her accomplishments. The invented character of Benoit and Eliza's fantasies about him - just unnecessary. Disappointing."}, {"userName": "Cathy", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7510544-cathy", "userReview": "Find all my book reviews plus author interviews, book extracts and guest posts, on my blog: https://whatcathyreadnext.wordpress.com/In her afterword, the author explains how a snippet of conversation overheard whilst visiting an exhibition about indigo became the inspiration for The Indigo Girl. I was reminded of a quote I read recently by Bernie McGill, author of The Watch House: \u2018As a fiction writer, I am always looking for the gaps between recorded events, the spaces in between\u2019. In this case, the author has taken the true story of Eliza Lucas and using historical documents, including Eliza\u2019s own letters, filled the spaces in between to produce a fascinating book about life in 18th century America. The book includes excerpts from Eliza\u2019s letters at relevant points in the narrative.In case this is making it sound like The Indigo Girl is a dry treatise on the process of producing indigo dye, I can reassure potential readers that it\u2019s much more than this. It\u2019s also an enthralling story full of action, intrigue \u2013 even a hint of romance \u2013 with an engaging central character. In The Indigo Girl, Eliza emerges as a much more lively individual than the rather formal style of her actual letters would suggest. However, the letters give a hint of the determination and independence of spirit exhibited by the Eliza of the novel.Given charge of running the family estate in South Carolina when her father is forced to return to their holdings in Antigua, Eliza sets out to transform the family\u2019s fortunes by growing indigo, fuelled by her interest in botany. The only trouble is the cultivation of indigo and its transformation into high quality dye seems akin to a mystical process, the knowledge of which is held only by some of the slaves on the plantation: \u2018The secret has been passed down through generations, perhaps even from ancient times.\u2019 Gaining access to this knowledge brings Eliza into conflict with one of her father\u2019s overseers because of his cruel treatment of the estate\u2019s slaves. And her involvement in running the estate is looked at askance by Eliza\u2019s mother, who is worried that it will ruin Eliza\u2019s marriage prospects by going against the norms of polite society. Much to her mother\u2019s horror, Eliza is more interested in the accounts and researching cultivation techniques than in tea drinking and embroidery.In her heart, Eliza knows that she has only been placed in charge because both her brothers are at school in England. Her appointment is one of necessity not a sign of female emancipation. However, she clings to the vain hope that if she can make a success of it she can escape the inevitability of marriage.\u2018Three crop seasons to get it right. If I didn\u2019t succeed by then, marriage was my only option. A marriage not to save the family or our land \u2013 a wealthy man could buy himself a more biddable wife than I \u2013 but marriage so my family would not have to support me any longer.\u2019 After several unsuccessful attempts to grow indigo, Eliza eventually persuades her father to hire a consultant. However, this sets off a chain of events that will ultimately end in tragedy for some, their just desserts for others and happiness for the people who matter.I knew nothing about the growing of indigo or the production of indigo dye and its economic and political importance before reading this book so I found this aspect of the book particularly fascinating. As a keen gardener, I could also appreciate the challenges of experimenting with different sowing times, growing conditions and aftercare in an effort to achieve success.I now know that the export of indigo dye from South Carolina laid the foundation for the wealth of many Southern families meaning Eliza\u2019s accomplishments influenced the course of US history. Indeed, the author notes that, when Eliza died in 1793, President George Washington served as a pallbearer at her funeral. I\u2019m so glad the author was able to celebrate the achievements of this remarkable woman and, at the same time, craft such an enjoyable novel. If it were needed, this reminds me why I enjoy reading historical fiction so much: entertainment and education in one lovely package.I received an advance reader copy courtesy of NetGalley and publishers, Blackstone, in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Amy Coury", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20061639-amy-coury", "userReview": "I don't usually read Historical books, but I found this very interesting and very well written.

I love that Eliza was a real person, a teen who lived on her father's plantation, and in his military absence, not only ran the plantation, but started the planting of indigo seeds and with help from her black friends, figured out exactly how to make the seeds thrive and how to process them into rich dyes. This was in the 1740's, and no girl was held in esteem who was as driven and ingenious as Eliza was...she was an embarrassment to her mother, and talked about by her neighbors in the Charleston area. There are many sub-stories here, and all of them are intriguing. The book prodded me to look further into the history of Eliza and indigo production .... I wasn't disappointed."}, {"userName": "Colleen Turner", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3339335-colleen-turner", "userReview": "One of my favorite aspects of book blogging is coming into contact with other delightful bloggers and readers, as well as the wonderful people who work within the publishing world at large. When I saw the cover of The Indigo Girl I knew I had to showcase it for one of my Thursday Cover Crush posts. After that, one of my favorite bloggers - Amy at Passages to the Past and Historical Fiction Virtual Book Tours - hooked me up with Lauren Maturo - a Senior Publicist at Blackstone Publishing - who offered to send me a copy of the book to review! I was so excited to read this story about a true woman from history that I knew nothing about, and I'm so glad I did because she was truly a young woman before her time. As you can read from the synopsis, Eliza Lucas was put in a tremendously difficult situation and one that no one seemed to think she could really handle without assistance from others. In Natasha Boyd's hands, however, we get to meet a young woman with an unbelievable amount of determination and bravery, one that refused to let anyone tell her what she could/couldn't or should/shouldn't do. I can't imagine having the fortitude to tackle such a monumental task by myself ever, let alone at her age and in the time period in which she lived, but she did it and she did it without compromising who she was, which was a woman who was incredibly intelligent and resourceful and quite able to handle herself while also keeping her kindness and fairness with everyone she dealt with. She refused to just be married off to the highest bidder and fought tirelessly to make her family's plantations not only sustainable but thriving. If the true Eliza was even half as admirable as this one then her story really needs to be told more often.  I will admit that the overall story did lag somewhat for me in the middle. The attention given to the actual growing of the plants and what it took to create the indigo dye - which was a very complicated process and one that not many people knew about - just wasn't as interesting to me as I would have hoped. This aspect has nothing to do with the writing style and is more about the fact that planting and harvesting just aren't that fascinating to me, but it did affect my enjoyment of these sections of the story nonetheless. There was also a lot of repetitiveness when it came to Eliza's complicated feelings towards both a childhood friend and a new friend and there were times where it felt like those storylines could have been sped up somewhat or at least not discussed as much when there wasn't any new advancements in the situations to move the storylines along. With the above being said, what this young woman accomplished was remarkable and I'm very glad I learned her story. I really appreciate that the author's writing felt very authentic given the time period and that she didn't overdramatize the romantic storyline that develops slowly and sweetly. The author also included a nice author's note at the end of the book - which I always love and appreciate - giving the reader a little more information about the true Eliza and her more famous sons. I absolutely loved the excerpts of Eliza's letters that were also interspersed throughout the narrative. I'm still amazed that Eliza's story hasn't been told more in our American history and I really hope this changes. I'm also excited to see what Natasha Boyd might write next as I enjoyed how she brought Eliza's story to life."}, {"userName": "Good Book Fairy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1629141-good-book-fairy", "userReview": "The Indigo Girl is a beautifully rendered tale of Eliza Lucas and her journey to create indigo in the states. Her obstinacy, drive, courage and brains made her a woman to root for. It\u2019s books like these that I\u2019m beyond grateful for; they tell the little known story of fascinating American history. The importance of ink, as our country grew, was crucial.The author, Natasha Boyd, knows how to spin a story. She\u2019s written several contemporary romance series that have brought her much success. This book is his first foray into Historical Fiction and I\u2019m hoping it\u2019s not her last. Her background in romance was evident as she expertly wove flirtation and connection into the novel. The historical detail was on point, yet never felt like I was reading a Wikipedia page. Even the attention to dialect and terminology of the time period was spot on. I just loved this book.With scares from Indians, slave uprisings and not knowing whom to trust, watching this sixteen-year-old girl navigate the plantations and overcome those who want to bring her down is quite inspiring. Eliza was a champion for the slaves and treated them with respect. Bringing this story to life is definitely a proud moment for women in history.

The story of a 16 year-old young woman being left to manage her father\u2019s holdings in South Carolina as he goes off to pursue his expensive military career in the mid-1700s is an absolutely tantalizing idea. Between Eliza\u2019a father\u2019s obviously ruinous business practices and the expenses of his military commissions, this child would need the business acumen of Warren Buffet, the diplomatic skill of Senator George Mitchell (Retired) and the authority granted to any white male. Needless to say, Eliza is a natural at the first, a quick study on the second, and unlikely to become a male.When you give a young lady wrestling with the immorality of slavery and racism, and some personal experience with a friend her father could sell, there\u2019s going to be an issue. Add in a mother, embarrassed and resentful that Eliza\u2019s father imbues her with so much authority over the estate and you get a very human family drama. That this brilliant woman was dissed because she was female, and young is depressing \u2014 that women, and people of color, still face these struggles is even more so. The narrator offers a wonderful interpretation of the character: smart and mature beyond her years \u2014 but still a teen \u2014 dumped with a ton of responsibility but without the authority of a man in a man\u2019s world. She gives the character a lot of nuance: cultured and educated, a little prissy, innocent and then angry as her innocence is stripped away by betrayal and slavery\u2019s worst secrets. I found the narration delivered a girl\u2019s voice, confused by her attraction her father\u2019s former slave, and to her friend\u2019s husband.The writing feels a little precious, and weighed down with detail. Though billed as \u201cadult\u201d it is fine for anyone who\u2019s begun dating. Though non-consensual sex between a slave and an overseer is implied, there\u2019s no sexual romance. It brings up this topic and offers a way to discuss it that doesn\u2019t judge the woman.Much is implied about the mysterious nature of indigo extraction but it is not well explained.But, unsurprisingly, I felt there wasn\u2019t a lot of information in the historical record for the author; the efforts of one young woman, no matter how unconventional, are unlikely to be recorded or honored in official records. But it is obvious that the writer understands the importance of a new, and incredibly valuable, crop. There are a lot of issues involved in this novel: women\u2019s rights, slavery, rape and parental responsibility to children. You might be surprised by how the differences and similarities between then and now are described. But, even then people of conscience existed and they wrestled with these moral dilemmas even if they could do nothing to change them."}], "description": "An incredible story of dangerous and hidden friendships, ambition, betrayal, and sacrifice.The year is 1739. Eliza Lucas is sixteen years old when her father leaves her in charge of their family's three plantations in rural South Carolina and then proceeds to bleed the estates dry in pursuit of his military ambitions. Tensions with the British, and with the Spanish in Florida, just a short way down the coast, are rising, and slaves are starting to become restless. Her mother wants nothing more than for their South Carolina endeavor to fail so they can go back to England. Soon her family is in danger of losing everything.Upon hearing how much the French pay for indigo dye, Eliza believes it's the key to their salvation. But everyone tells her it's impossible, and no one will share the secret to making it. Thwarted at nearly every turn, even by her own family, Eliza finds that her only allies are an aging horticulturalist, an older and married gentleman lawyer, and a slave with whom she strikes a dangerous deal: teach her the intricate thousand-year-old secret process of making indigo dye and in return -- against the laws of the day -- she will teach the slaves to read.So begins an incredible story of love, dangerous and hidden friendships, ambition, betrayal, and sacrifice.Based on historical documents, including Eliza's letters, this is a historical fiction account of how a teenage girl produced indigo dye, which became one of the largest exports out of South Carolina, an export that laid the foundation for the incredible wealth of several Southern families who still live on today. Although largely overlooked by historians, the accomplishments of Eliza Lucas influenced the course of US history. When she passed away in 1793, President George Washington served as a pallbearer at her funeral.This book is set between 1739 and 1744, with romance, intrigue, forbidden friendships, and political and financial threats weaving together to form the story of a remarkable young woman whose actions were before their time: the story of the indigo girl.", "title": "The Indigo Girl", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34412073-the-indigo-girl", "average": 4.22, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1493814273l/34412073.jpg", "reviews": 272, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7046321.Natasha_Boyd", "name": "Natasha Boyd"}], "type": ["Historical", "Historical", "Fiction", "American", "Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34412073-the-indigo-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35050975-the-indigo-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35826698-the-indigo-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34412076-the-indigo-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17793815-eversea", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18077900-forever-jack", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24700453-deep-blue-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23942869-all-that-jazz", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38320631-accidental-tryst"]}
