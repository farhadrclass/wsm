I won't waste your time enumerating all the plot holes.The second story I thought was really unrealistic but oddly humorous in a way. A woman falls for a man that has leeringly called her \"beautiful\" because no other man has referred to her by that term. He falls for her when he is half-conscious, listening to her singing in hopes of calming him as he is sewn by Dr. Beaumont. Okay.Then this drunken, licentious reprobate converts to Christianity after reading parts of a Bible ,with no struggle at all of giving up his old ways... I found the story humorous rather than anything.In the third story I don't know what made Francie fall in love with Thomas. She is an artist and he is a prig with no creativity or imagination. Too bad she was so sheltered growing up.The final story is nothing to write home about, though I think Allison behaved in ways that did not make sense. Two stars for the (unintended) humor in the second story and the detail in geography and businesses in the final story which made me miss Mackinac Island."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/648105-shannon", "userReview": "I generally read Christian fiction, not for the religion, but because I know they're clean. This one was a bit heavy-handed with the religious themes. The stories were all decent, though some of the ways they tied the stories together seemed a little contrived. What I really liked was the view of Mackinac Island and its history."}, {"userName": "Paula Shreckhise", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47984664-paula-shreckhise", "userReview": "I love anything to do with Mackinaw Island.
