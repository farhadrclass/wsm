That\u2019s the way I feel about A Blade of Grass by South African/Canadian author Lewis Desoto, which was longlisted for the Booker in 2004. It\u2019s a story of an inter-racial friendship set on the contested South African frontier in the 1970s during the apartheid era. I found it to be a remarkable debut novel that was engaging from the very beginning yet managed to raise complex issues about entitlement to land; about power and gender; and about the destructive effects of fear of The Other.So you can imagine my surprise when I discovered from some outraged comments at GoodReads that some readers are very cross about this book. For some, there is too much lyrical description, for others too much symbolism. One who thought that  DeSoto also has absolutely no place in writing from a female perspective  took issue with the way that the peace and harmony of the relationship between two female protagonists, one Black, one White, is disrupted by jealousy over a man. Someone else is peeved about the stereotyping of entrenched racist Afrikaaners; ambivalent, hopeful Britishers; and resentful, disenfranchised Africans. (There was also a reader who thought it was set during the Boer War. The less said about that the better, eh?) The novel copped a very negative review at 'Culture Wars' too.I don\u2019t think that I read this novel uncritically, so I was relieved to see not only some positive views amongst the others at GR, but also this one from Quill and Quire. I felt that this novel rendered the complexities of living in a racist society with the respect it deserves. The two central characters, Mar\u00eft and Tembi, are creatures of the society in which they grew up and their identities are forged by the black/white divide. Even when they transcend this divide, as Desoto renders it, they inevitably retain some habits of thought and behaviour, and in moments of crisis they revert to old habits even if intellectually and emotionally they reject them. This seems entirely realistic to me.To read the rest of my review please visit http://anzlitlovers.com/2015/01/25/a-..."}, {"userName": "Jo-Ann Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5938336-jo-ann-murphy", "userReview": "This was a violent long walk to nowhere. It had possibilities but they remain unrealized. Marit was weak and long suffering who never grew into her power. Tembi had strength but did not use it wisely. the relationship between the two was not fully developed and not as complex as it should have been. None of the male characters had redeeming qualities. It did not live up to the promises on the book jacket. I don't feel I learned anything from reading it and don't think much will stick with me. It took a long time to engage me in the story. However, when it did we just seemed to move from tragedy to tragedywithout the joy that could have made it a richer story. It certainly was not an uplifting read, in my opinion. It seems there could have been a whole lot more to this story in this setting during this era."}, {"userName": "Jackie", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1388707-jackie", "userReview": "The most literary book I have read in some time--it is a work of real craftsmanship. Lovely imagery, gorgeous use of language--this author could be studied as easily as any in our canon. The story is set on a small farm in South Africa during apartheid. The main characters are a young white woman named Marit, the owner of the farm, and a young black woman named Tembi. After a tragic occurrence, the two become friends and partners in running the farm. The book explores their sincere affection for one another, along with thier distrust. It also describes the violence and desolation of the period. The story is overwhelmingly sad, but very beautiful."}, {"userName": "Niki", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2656452-niki", "userReview": "Wow. This book is incredible. I won't give out any spoilers, but this story is about two women - one European, one native South African - whose lives intersect and become connected .. during the last throes of the rule of apartheid. Their relationship is not straight-forward, but complicated, and the author explores each women's prejudices and fears in a manner that feels very honest and realistic. While these women need each other, love each other and depend on each other for their very survival, nonetheless their fears constantly threaten to break their relationship apart and shatter any hope that they will survive the many struggles that arise.The story moves very quickly and is full of exciting drama, but it never feels melodramatic or false. The writing style is simple and straight-forward in terms of vocabulary, and yet touching and personal.Can't say enough good things about it.

I read up on its reviews and wasn't too impressed. Apparently the critics weren't fans.I read all 389 pages in 24 hours. It was incredible and I could not put it down. Not perfect, but incredible. Having grown up in Africa (although not South Africa), the race relations aspect in this book fascinated me because I've never seen it put so well into words. The story was a great balance of depth without pointlessness and action without making your head spin.

It was a very descriptive story about apartheid and had wonderful descriptive scenes of South Africa. I found the story to be gripping and I had a lot of respect for the strength of the two women characters. I would have given it a 5 but I found some of the writing to be repetitive like I wanted to hand the author a Thesaurus. Words were often repeated several times in a few sentences.

For that reason I rated the book 2 instead of 3. Even at the end, I couldn't muster the enthusiasm to rate the book any higher. If you wish to read about S.

It is set in South Africa sometime in the 1970s on a farm owned by a young couple, Ben and Marit (British and Boer). Another central character in the book is Tembi, an African girl that eventually ends up as the \"meid\" in Ben and Marit's house. Throughout the novel, you are put in situations as a reader where your instinctive feelings that may arise while reading this book may come in conflict with what you thought your feelings were (or would/should be) on the situation as a non-racist and good person. The book does this by taking Marit and Tembi and placing them into very similar situations. The question is, do your feelings and reactions change when it is Marit versus Tembi in any given situation? For instance, a theme throughout the book is who rightly owns this land in South Africa. Is it the farmers that have bought the land, perhaps even family owned for generations? Is it the workers that actually toil so that the farm can produce? Is it the African people that have been removed from the land and placed instead in unhospitable land where nothing grows (forcing them to work in the mines, away from their families)? Are the animals really the only rightful owners of the land? So, when you read the book and the white characters, Ben and Marit, own the land, do you feel all is right with the world, and cheer for them and their success on the farm? Do you instead hope that the understandably bitter, angry and sneaky African that manages the farm ends up with it? When at one point, Tembi the maid temporarily becomes the mistress of the house and Marit is locked out and sent to live in the staff huts, are you happy about this or bothered by it? When the war starts and white soliders show up, are you less scared for Marit and Tembi than when the black soldiers later show up? Do you have a feeling of relief for Marit when the white soldiers show up and a feeling of relief for Tembi when the black ones arrive? Does the color of a soldier's skin make any difference in the amount of havoc they will bring to females alone on a farm, whether black or white?I appreciated A Blade of Grass: A Novel for the debate that it brought about in my own mind. There is a way you think you would behave had you been a part of history in South Africa. Then there are the feelings that come up while reading this book that make you wonder if you are being honest with yourself in imagining how upright and moral you would actually react to the situation if you were in it during that time and place. If you were a child born into a Boer or English family, would you really be able to understand this land is not yours and behave accordingly?This isn't a book I would tell you to go out and get. However, if you find yourself in a used bookstore and it catches your eye, I would say pick it up and buy it, just like I did. It's worth a read. I must warn you, the dialogue is horrible in some parts -- not at all what I would imagine someone would really say in given situations!"}, {"userName": "Pamela Pickering", "userReviewDate": "Mar 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/837540-pamela-pickering", "userReview": "I think the book's synopsis leads the reader to believe there is a little more \"action\" in the book than there really is. However don't let that deter you. The story is mainly one of a relationship between two women of two cultures. They are both dealing with the loss of a loved one and begin to work together to accomplish a shared goal. Not knowing much about South Africa (especially in the 1970's)I really appreciated the cultural and sociological aspects of this novel. The writing flows easily. I have loaned it to five women and all have made statements such as \"I couldn't tear myslef away from it\". We all agreed that we did not care for the ending but also agreed that it probably could not have ended any other way (again, don't let this deter you from reading it).

DeSoto writes in a strangely passionless tone of voice. The frequent Afrikaans phrases are at times so wrong that they hardly make sense (of course, that would only bother a person who speaks the language). Would it have been so hard to find somebody to edit?It also annoyed me that the author didn't bother to check his facts, for instance the way in which a cicada makes its noise and how a baboon would attack a person.

Desoto uses language like a painter uses colour. Sparingly in some places, vibrantly in others, resulting in an image that shows us more than people, more than a place. Desoto creates beauty and violence, home and isolation, hope and despair, love and hatred, loyalty and abandonment, freedom and imprisonment. This story is set during the apartheid years of South Africa's history, and I admire the way Desoto avoids stereotypical depictions of both whites and blacks.

Unfortunately, it is not a happy ending. While conciliation may have been possible between the women and maybe mutual benefit occurring for the two the world around them conspires to prevent this from happening. While most of the violence is perpetuated by males, I noticed that most of the Boer women weren't portrayed any more accommodating the the men. I prefer stories of fixable situations.

In A Blade of Grass, Lewis DeSoto took a place and a time, a complicated, beautiful place at a complicated, horrible time and threw it repeatedly in the reader's face. And for all of that (and there is a lot of that), it is primarily a story of a tenuous friendship between two women who should have never become friends, except that they were both lonely and alone. Tembi grew up in the place her people had always lived, until the man came and told them they would all have to go somewhere else. And when they had been moved, they found the land they had been moved to, a land they had no connection to, could not support them. And so they left; first the men, to work in the mines and then the women, to work as domestic servants. Tembi goes with her mother to live on a farm, where her mother takes care of the house. Tembi, now a young woman, works in the dairy and while she doesn't feel a part of the life of the Kral, she is happy to be with her mother. And then her mother is killed. Tembi is asked to work in the house, but she's not sure she can work for the woman there.Marit has married an Englishman who wants to be a farmer. They find a farm on good land that they can afford because it is near the border and there has been some unrest, but Ben is both optimistic and determined and he is willing to work hard. Marit's a bit unmoored in this strange place inhabited by stolid Boers and the silent Blacks working for them, but she is willing to support her husband with his dream; it's what she's been raised to do. And then her husband is killed and she is adrift, with only the housekeeper to speak to. There is an immediacy and a force to DeSoto's writing. The reader is never given a specific time or place to hang the story on, but his descriptions are vivid and kept close by the use of the present tense throughout. This has the effect of making the events in the story carry far more weight as there is no sense of an \"afterwards\". Both Tembi and Marit were complex characters, which was important in this book of great wrongs and disasters."}, {"userName": "Virginia", "userReviewDate": "Apr 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40206514-virginia", "userReview": "The main character was stupid, annoying, frustrating and totally unrealistic.

Overly descriptive, vague and empty-feeling, and characters living in their heads instead of in the real world. I should have taken my cue from the first chapter, which is ridiculously grandiose in its description, and left the book there. But no, I felt I hadn't been fair enough to it, so on I read, until this afternoon, when I decided that if I preferred staring mindlessly off into space on the bus instead of reading, the book probably had to go.This book uses a maddening present tense to tell the story of M\u00e4rit Laurens, wife of gentleman farmer Ben Laurens, and their life on the farm near the South African border with an unnamed country. It's supposed to be about apartheid and violence and tragedy, but the 98 pages I read mostly involved thoughts, musings and ruminations, with the occasional internal monologue to liven things up. Plot-wise, M\u00e4rit is supposed to be drawn to her maid, Tembi, after Tembi's mother and M\u00e4rit's husband both die, and they are supposed to be involved in a struggle for survival. Unfortunately, I don't care much about M\u00e4rit -- her thoughts are kind of boring -- and knowing that Ben is supposed to die really hinders my ability to appreciate his character, since I'm just sitting there waiting for the axe to drop.I say the present tense is \"maddening\" because it makes me feel like the events are just kind of floating there outside of the regular time-space continuum. I prefer good solid past tense. And the characters were really not that interesting, with the exception of Ben, who seemed to be the only one who did anything meaningful (although to be fair, Tembi does more than M\u00e4rit). That could be because men had greater freedom in this society, white men in particular, but if the book is focusing on the women I expect them to be able to do more than sit around and pout and suddenly turn embarrassingly horny with no real explanation.

Turns out it's about South Africa during the Boer War. It really is a poignant story, of an independent woman and life on a farm--two themes that generally attract me. And I like historical fiction. But something about South Africa just doesn't appeal to me too much. So in all the relationships among people I just could not be hooked because the background distracted me more than the one hot love scene did.There were several things that I did appreciate--Tembi's garden, the two women's ways of finding solace in each other, Marit's transformation. But most of all I appreciated the uncomfortable position I found myself in, and all the thinking-about-it that came from that, when revolutionary soldiers come to the farm to claim it for themselves. After all, the idea of the land belonging to the people who work it appeals to me (thanks, Emiliano Zapata), but Marit and her husband had paid for it!

The incredibly hardworking Dutch Boer settlers who first began to farm that area have serious roots in that land as of course, do the natives. The revolutionaries (Russian trained Mandela comes to mind) succeeded in upending the status quo there in the 60's, but then found that running and managing productive farms is not a walk in the park and some of these countries went bankrupt. The persistence of the white farmers in that part of the world has long fascinated me. (The book \"Don't Let's go to the Dogs Tonight\" is a memoir about a farming family that has to move because of the wars.)

At first I thought the women were unsympathetic, but no, they're just badly written. As a woman, I found the actions and decisions of the two central characters and their relationship to be completely unrealistic and actually offensive. Really, everything's going well until a man shows up and suddenly these women lose their shit? How cliche. For a book that seems to be about these two women and the unlikely bond that is forged, DeSoto has no problem breaking it down so easily. And then the book loses focus. Is it a war story now? Survival tale? So then we get to this ending. Oh, it's all come full circle, Tembi is planting the seeds again, starting over, hope blooms. No!

One thing after another goes wrong in the farm, making it a string of mishaps, the relationship between Tembi and Marit is not elaborated enough, there no discussions on the races and the tension between them and the end of the novel is very slow coming.

The mistress of the house, Marit, is young, recently orphaned, easily intimidated, and unaccustomed to rural life. With no close neighbors or friends, Marit feels isolated in the house while her husband works in the fields all day. Marit's displacement is soon echoed in the character of Tembi, the daughter of Marit's household maid, who assumes her mother's responsibilities in the farmhouse after she is hit by a car.An encroaching civil war soon threatens the tranquility of the farm, and before long a plague of violence descends. Abandoned by the other farm workers, the care of the farm is now left to Marit and Tembi, who begin this new struggle for survival as equals, but whose unity is put to a devastating test.DeSoto paints an unforgettable portrait of South Africa with tensions, both political and sexual, simmering underneath. Recalling J. M. Coetzee's Disgrace in his portrayal of Apartheid, DeSoto explodes onto the literary scene with a first novel of tremendous power and literary skill. His description of a terrifying world gone awry holds at its center a deep understanding of the patience of the land, and the enduring hope for renewal.", "title": "A Blade of Grass", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209901.A_Blade_of_Grass", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1435875182l/209901.jpg", "reviews": 123, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/122891.Lewis_DeSoto", "name": "Lewis DeSoto"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Cultural", "Historical", "Southern Africa", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/209901.A_Blade_of_Grass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10827986-a-blade-of-grass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/876257.A_Blade_Of_Grass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/876234.Blade_Of_Grass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17305000-the-restoration-artist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3007006-emily-carr", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27303132-empire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385794.Pe_Tukmiyat_Pe_Tukmiyat", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/385791.Lewis_De_Soto", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
