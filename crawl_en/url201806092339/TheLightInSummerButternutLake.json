Billy and Luke always had a good relationship until recently. After her father died, Luke has no male role model as Luke\u2019s father was out of the picture before Luke was ever born. Since he disappeared soon after he and Billy got together, he never even knew Billy was pregnant. Sometimes she feels guilty that Luke knows nothing about his father, Wesley, except his name and that moved to Alaska. But why disturb things now? It could cause too many problems. And then there is the new guy in town, Cal Cooper who appears to be interested in Billy but has problems of his own to sort out.This was an easy read and is apparently part of a series set in Butternut Lake. Though I had not read the others it did not matter. I enjoyed this book although in many ways I found the changing relationship between Billy and her son, more interesting than that with Cal. And I have to admit to getting annoyed with the name Pop-Pop by which Billy\u2019s father and Luke\u2019s grandfather was referred to. For some reason it grated every time I read it. But that is a minor quibble. He was a man of great wisdom. I liked this advice he gave Billy about dealing with regrets and the choices life hands you that often leads you on a different path. \u2019I learned then that you should work hard, have dreams, and set goals, but don\u2019t let the things you didn\u2019t do prevent you from being grateful for the things right in front of your eyes.\u2019 That line really spoke to me.This is an enjoyable read, filled with interesting characters and a great setting. Billy is a librarian and I loved the way she pointed others to books they might like and her own reading passion which focused on Jane Austin novels. It was a cute touch. I will now look up some of the other books in this series."}, {"userName": "Carrie Schmidt (Reading is My SuperPower)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6084197-carrie-schmidt-reading-is-my-superpower", "userReview": "Let me say upfront: Y\u2019all are going to love the heroine, Billy. For starters, she is a librarian and a true book lover. The kind who sniffs books and has reread all Jane Austen\u2019s novels until her copies fell apart. The kind that associates people with the books they check out. The kind who knows the fear of being somewhere without a book.Another reason I love Billy is the fact that she carries on conversations with her sweet dog Murphy, both internally and aloud. Her dialogues with Murphy are spot on in that McNear gives Murphy such personality through these conversations. Even though, of course, he never says a word. But anyone who\u2019s been owned by a dog knows that he doesn\u2019t have to speak to convey how he feels.I really enjoy Mary McNear\u2019s writing style. It\u2019s light and breezy, witty and warm, but there\u2019s depth between the lines. The characters are people you would want as friends (even the somewhat quirky library patrons), and the setting of Butternut Lake makes me want to book a vacation. And I\u2019m saying that as someone who doesn\u2019t do camping or lakeside anything. McNear\u2019s stories set here have made me fall in love with a place I would never willingly visit in real life. And isn\u2019t that the beauty of fiction? To be safely adventurous, to enjoy a lake without the heat or mosquitoes, to be a librarian without having to go back to school. To fall in love all over again. To make new friends while keeping the old.Bottom Line: When Billy\u2019s story (and her son Luke\u2019s) intersect with Cal\u2019s own story, there may not be any neatly resolved storylines in their fictional lives but for readers there is a contented satisfaction. Grief, disillusionment, parenting woes, and relationship navigating \u2013 all are presented with authenticity, emotion, and heart. The romance is swoonilicious, yes, but it\u2019s really just icing on the cake. The Light in Summer works well as a standalone, but it will make you want to go back and read the first four books to discover the stories of the other characters mentioned.Reviewer\u2019s Note: Readers may want to be aware that there is some profanity in this book as well as implications of intimate scenes (closed door) and some heavy-duty making out.(I voluntarily reviewed a complimentary copy of this book)see my full review at Reading Is My SuperPower"}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7001837-marlene", "userReview": "Originally published at Reading RealityI love the Butternut Lake series. I really, really do. But, and it\u2019s a very big but, in spite of the heroine being a librarian, I did not love this particular entry in the series.The Butternut Lake series so far have all been contemporary small-town romances with more than a smidgen of what is dreadfully labelled Women\u2019s Fiction. I hate that term but it has become a handy catch-all descriptor for stories that include a slice of women\u2019s lives and often their strong friendships and other relationships.I\u2019ve also referred to Butternut Lake as \u201cSecond Chance Lake\u201d because so many of the romances feature second chances at love, sometimes even with the original love-interest.The series is stand-alone-ish. Each entry is complete, and the reader usually doesn\u2019t have to know much about what came before to become familiar with the town and its residents. The Light in Summer may be the exception to that rule. The hero in this book is the brother of the heroine in the first book, Up at Butternut Lake.But as much as I have enjoyed this series, this one did not work for me. While in most of the books there has been a lot going on in the life of the protagonists, the stories have usually given equal weight to whatever those other crises might be and the romance.For this reader, the romance between Cal and Billy (very short for Wilhelmina) takes a far back seat to all of Billy\u2019s quite justifiable angst over the behavior of her son Luke, who seems to be entering adolescence with a vengeance. Billy is right to worry. Luke is hanging out with the wrong crowd, getting into serious trouble, lying to her and letting his grades slip. His attitude has also dived into the toilet, but the problem isn\u2019t the attitude so much as all the bad things and people that the attitude is leading him towards.The recent death of Billy\u2019s father, the only father-figure that Luke has ever had, has thrown them all into a tailspin. And Billy is caught in the age-old dilemma of how much she needs to be a parent vs. how much she wants to be a friend and confidant.But all of Luke\u2019s issues, and Billy\u2019s issues with Luke, completely overwhelm the story. The romance gets such short shrift that we really don\u2019t see it develop. We don\u2019t have enough interactions between Cal and Billy to buy into their chemistry.Escape Rating C: I\u2019ll admit that I\u2019m probably in a minority on this, but the focus on Billy\u2019s problems as a parent, as real as they are, just don\u2019t hold my attention. There\u2019s a lot of teenage angst in this story, and if that was what I was looking for, I\u2019d have found it. But it is not something that I look for, and certainly didn\u2019t expect to find it in this book or this series.I\u2019m still looking forward to more in this series, but for this reader, The Light in Summer didn\u2019t have nearly enough romantic heat. Your reading mileage may vary. But if you are looking for an entry in this series that does a much better blend of family drama with romance and small-town feels, go back to The Space Between Sisters, which was terrific. More like that, please!"}, {"userName": "Ionia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16434239-ionia", "userReview": "I thought this was a good book. I particularly liked the descriptions of the relationship between the main character and her son. The author did an excellent job of representing the awkward relationship between a mother and her teenage son. As for the romance, I thought it was perfect. It wasn't so far fetched that it was impossible to believe. The characters not only seemed realistic, but had real word problems to deal with outside of their emerging relationship with one another. This novel has the perfect amount of sensuality without pushing the line into disgusting territory. I loved the way the author handled the attraction between her characters and I found myself rooting for both of them. I love it when you can read a book and feel good about all of the characters. I liked everyone in this book equally and even now, after it has been a while since I finished it, i still think of them as if they were real people. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys beautiful scenery, family and good friends. I loved it. The Jane Austen references made it even better.

I loved my visit there and will have to go back and read the rest of the series now.This is the story of Billy and her son Luke. Billy was an eighteen year old when she found herself pregnant after her first sexual encounter. She raised Luke with the help of her parents, grandma and PopPop, and now Luke is thirteen and having issues. PopPop died a year earlier and he is struggling with his emotions. He has started to associate with some troublesome teens and get himself in hot water. Billy does not know what to do, she feels like a jailer, constantly punishing him. As the summer rolls along, their relationship takes some turns as Billy struggles with the idea of contacting Luke's father, he really wants to meet him. Of course this book is a family drama as well as a romance and Billy meets Cal. She has not dated much and is unsure of what to do. This is a love at first sight situation, but they do not act on it right away. There is a build up to their relationship that, even though quick, it is tender and has some bumps along the road. I enjoyed the three main characters in this story. They were real, their struggles were real. Billy is a wonderful mom, who despite this, her son has some problems. At times he might seem selfish, but he is only 13 and that is the way 13 year olds are. Cal is also struggling with his life. He is not sure what is next, what direction to take or where to live. Despite all that, he is funny, easy going and caring. Of course being an avid reader, I loved that Billy is a librarian, and a good one at that. There are several books mentioned in this story, many classics, that I will check out. They are integrated into the story nicely. The secondary characters add much to the story, even though they are not in it for long periods of time. Overall a wonderful summer read. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good family drama as well as some romance and happy endings.

Be ready for a read that features a small 'Butternut Lake town living at its best with angst teenager, and many family dysfunctions' I found this novel definitely a read for all women who know that they must always be able to face the past before you will be able to move in a forward direction. The characters [Billy, Luke, Murphy [the dog], and Cal to name a few are all well developed, portrayed and even could be very believable giving this story one that will keep the reader turning the pages. Billy [the mom] will have her hands full as she is dealing with her troubled son after the death of her father. Now her son [Luke] who is wanting to know about his father and that will definitely present some extra worry for her to have to deal with. Even though this was a rather predictable read it still was a good read.

A single mother, she's had the support of her parents, who helped her provide a loving home for her son. For the past several years, she and Luke have lived a few hours away in Butternut, but they made regular visits to St. Paul. With the death of her father a year ago, though, Billy lost an important sounding board, and, perhaps more importantly, Luke lost his father figure.Luke has always been a good kid, but lately he's begun to worry Billy. Concerned that he's involved with some unsavory people, she tries to sequester him. The person she would go to for help, though, is not with her any longer, and Billy feels his loss.Enter Cal Cooper, a native of Butternut who has returned from Seattle, his marriage having fallen apart. He and Billy have an immediate attraction, but she's concerned. With her problems with Luke, and with his increasing curiosity about his father, does she have room in her life for a boyfriend?Mary McNear treats you to the perspectives of Billy, Cal, and Luke, showing you what each thinks and feels. The most heartbreaking is Luke, whose struggles to find his way without the anchor his grandfather provided will make you care deeply for him. You may not always like how he behaves, but you certainly can understand why he does so.Billy is lovable, as is Cal, and you will cheer on their romance. All the while, lurking in the background, is the man from Billy's past, Luke's father. You understand her reticence to contact him, and you feel her fears. You also feel Cal's openness to love, and you are so hopeful for him.This is a sweet love story, and you will enjoy it. Fans of McNear's Butternut Lake series will enjoy reconnecting with characters you've met before.

Billie is the librarian, but also a mother of a teenage boy who just suffered a lost and don't know how to deal with that grief. His answer's to lash out at his mother, and seek the father he never knew. As this mother and son try to handle this change in familial dynamics, readers get a sense of what complications life can throw at you. A story that takes you page after page, The Light in Summer has a lightness to it in a small town setting that just makes it an easy read, despite touching on some heavy topics like grief and parenting. The characters are interesting, yet there is a certain disconnect which I believe have more to do with it being a part of the series.

Since it was fifth in a series, I decided to read the first four books in case of cross-over storylines or characters.

She has been the town librarian for a few years and is the single mother of a 13-year old boy who is experiencing some issues.

Her books are very well written and her characters are always well developed! I always feel like I know them! I truly enjoyed this book!

You can tell she has teenagers as the problems faced by both Billy and Luke are totally believable! Cal, the town's new handsome and successful architect has his own struggles, we soon learn. By masterfully weaving all three people together, McNear produces yet another novel that I couldn't put down."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41499697-sandra", "userReview": "I have been reading the Butternut Lake Series by Mary McNear. I really enjoyed The Light in Summer. It gives us more detail about a previous barely mentioned character. I like the way the author brings in real life situation and how they can sometimes be messy.

Great beach read with interesting characters and a great, current storyline. Plus references to Jane Austen, Seattle, Minneapolis. No spoilers here, but I picked this up at our library on their \"new\" shelves taking a chance and it was well worth it! Romance without any of the racy stuff, and every emotion from teenage angst to marital deceit."}, {"userName": "Tiffany Borne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12097083-tiffany-borne", "userReview": "I received this book from a Goodreads First Reads Giveaway, so I have not read any of the other books in the series. However it was no problem getting to know the characters or setting of the book, it can easily be read as a stand alone. I loved all the characters, and felt connected to the characters. I was interested to see what would happen next between the characters."}, {"userName": "annemarie_bookaholic", "userReviewDate": "Aug 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9471806-annemarie-bookaholic", "userReview": "Hmm what can I say about this book but wow I loved it. Loved learning about Billy, the librarian, and how she became a single mother. The chemistry with the characters in this book made it flow so gracefully...although the ending just happened....it stopped and left me wanting more..I hope there will be another Butternut Lake story"}, {"userName": "Colleen", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/883765-colleen", "userReview": "I won this book free from a GoodReads Give-away. I found this a fun book to read. Basically single mom Billy meets Cal and falls in love. Billy is dealing with a troubled son who is wanting to know who his father is. The father was a one night stand and may want nothing to do with him. A fun read and a little predictable.
