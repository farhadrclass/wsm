Thanks, goodreads.Alfred Kubin, \u201cThe Other Side\u201d (excerpt), 1908 (translation, Austria) Set somewhere on Earth in the fictional city of Pearl, this story featured an interesting juxtaposition of a straight-forward, almost newsprint-esque voice addressing the successive plagues of sleeping sickness, animal infestation, and non-organic decomposition that overtake the city, culminating in the protagonist\u2019s appeal to the lord (?) god (?) leader (?) of the city for some sort of explanation for the misery all around him. The sense of entropy and fantastical meta-recognition on display here brought to mind Viriconium pretty strongly. I liked this enough that I plan on searching out the complete novel. 4.5/5F. Marion Crawford, \u201cThe Screaming Skull,\u201d 1908  This was a very enjoyable ghost story about an old man living in a haunted house he inherited from his cousin after said cousin murdered his wife and then passed away. There was nothing really surprising or, ahem, weird in this one, and I\u2019m not entirely sure why it was included (particularly after the Vandermeers made the point in their introduction that only a few ghost stories were weird enough to include?). I did enjoy the way it was presented: the narration is the protagonist\u2019s half of a conversation with a visiting friend, whose responses are answered but never quoted directly. This story introduces the theme that several others touch on in this anthology: the acceptance or understanding of the un-/super-natural, as the narrator\u2019s refusal to accept this occurrences as proof of a murder lead inexorably to... well, you know. 4/5Algernon Blackwood, \u201cThe Willows,\u201d 1907 An intensely atmospheric story about two men on a camping trip in a swamp on the Danube who stumble onto some sort of nexus of interdimensional horrors. The focus is on the intersection of the natural world and supernatural forces and the inexplicable awe-inspiring weirdness of each, with a narrator who spends a lot of time ruminating on the effect of such on the human mind. Slow and longer than it needed to be, but the mood is pitch perfect and the build to the climax is truly creepy. 5/5Saki, \u201cSredni Vashtar,\u201d 1910 The boy Conradin lives with his cousin Mrs. De Ropp, who takes a certain enjoyment out of making him miserable. Conradin\u2019s only enjoyments in life are toast and the two pets he keeps hidden in a shed in the garden: a chicken and a ferret. He\u2019s scared of the ferret, though, and becomes more and more worshipful and fixated on this creature that he begins to view as his very own protective deity. This ferrety god of violence and suffering\u2019s name? SREDNI VASHTAR! Most interesting was the fact that the weird aspect of this story was quite possibly an entirely rational and ordinary event. 3/5M.R. James, \u201cCasting the Runes,\u201d 1911 Ok so this is a story about a guy who is SO MAD about negative reviews of his books and rejections of his conference proposals that he curses people with his dark nefarious arts. Ho hum. Again the theme pops up of the inability or refusal of the human mind to come to terms with such eldritch occurrences, although not so explicitly dwelt upon as it was in \u201cThe Willows.\u201d 2.5/5Lord Dunsany, \u201cHow Nuth Would Have Practiced his Art Upon the Gnoles,\u201d 1912 Nuth the burglar is the best burglar of all the burglars, but his bumbling apprentice is not up to snuff, so of course the two embark on a scheme to Robin Hood some giant emeralds from the gnoles, who appear to be fairies/elves/menacing little folk of the forest (and not hyena-esque gnolls, although the gnoles do appear to be their namesake). This was a good setup and I thought it was going in a different direction based on some of the narrator\u2019s comments on the antagonism between the propertied classes and Nuth\u2019s reappropriations, but it turns out that this is a very short story (as are the following two) and I was somewhat disappointed. It did have a great final line, though. 3/5Gustav Meyrink, \u201cThe Man in the Bottle,\u201d 1912 (translation, Austria) A decadent-ish (as in the literary tradition) story of a decadent (as in the lifestyle) masquerade ball - combination that I could not care much less about. I imagine most of the titles and names were supposed to mean something to me, but they didn\u2019t, and this one overall felt rather short and inconsequential. The first miss of the collection. 1/5Georg Heym, \u201cThe Dissection,\u201d 1913 (new translation by Gio Clairval, Germany) Another very short one, correctly identified by the Vandermeers in their introduction as more of a prose poem than a story, which contrasts the replaying of the happiest memory (ies?) of a cadaver with the messy end of his remains at the hands of a team of doctors. Much creepier and more atmospheric than anything else since \u201cThe Willows.\u201d 3/5Hanns Heinz Ewers, \u201cThe Spider,\u201d 1915 (translation, Germany) Oh hey women are like spiders who ensnare and then kill their mates, get it? zzzz 2/5Rabindranath Tagore, \u201cThe Hungry Stones,\u201d 1916 (India) This was fine but unlike, say, \u201cThe Willows\u201d which has stuck in my head in a big way, I don\u2019t think it will have any kind of lasting impact. In this first piece in the book by a non-Westerner the titular stones are the building materials making up an ancient palace built by a Persian Shah, now used as a residence by a humble collector of wool duties. The house, though, misses the former days of excess, and begins manifesting itself in the dreams of the narrator. It\u2019s better than that summary makes it sound, although it has an awkward framing narration (as do so many of these older stories!) and ends kind of mid-stream. Also, an off-putting number of references to the dainty feet of fair maidens...? 3/5Luigi Ugolini, \u201cThe Vegetable Man,\u201d 1917 (new translation by Anna and Brendan Connell, Italy; first-ever translation into English) You will never guess what the protagonist of this story finds himself turning into after an encounter with a mythical plant deep in the heart of the Amazon. A few creepy moments but overall another kind of inconsequential short piece. Minor annoyance: a Brazilian addressing a countryman in Spanish. 2.5/5A. Merritt, \u201cThe People of the Pit,\u201d 1918 Ok, back on track. I think it says a lot that this story, which is written in the most laughably awful pulpy way, was my favorite entry in a while. Again, a framing story: two guys hiking find a horrifically mangled third guy crawling through the snow. In his lucid moments, guy #3 recounts his trip down into THE PIT, a pre-deluvian hell on Earth of extra-dimensional slug monsters and bodiless terrific entities and haunted ruins and what have you. It just so happens that I think I can identify my three favorite aspects of weird stories: \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01. hell on Earth \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a02. extra-dimensional monsters, slug-esque or otherwise \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a03. haunted ruins Excellent work, Mr. Merritt. 4.5/5Ryunosuke Akutagawa, \u201cThe Hell Screen,\u201d 1918 (new translation, Japan) In which an artist whose name I forget is tasked by a lord who hates him (and whose name I also forget) to paint a portrait of Hell. The Weird aspects of the story come into play through dreams and the artist\u2019s attempts to stage real-life visions of Hell in order to paint them - nothing actually supernatural here. There\u2019s also a subplot about the lord's inappropriate interest in the artist\u2019s daughter, who seemed at first to be shaping into an interesting character, but then that went nowhere and she was reduced to a sadly typical agent-less hostage. 3/5Francis Stevens (Gertrude Barrows Bennett), \u201cUnseen?\u2014?Unfeared,\u201d 1919 The first story written by a woman - but a woman using a male pen name and featuring only men. A man and his buddy have a drink, discuss the misfortunes of a local scientist type who is commonly understood to have practiced witchcraft, and part ways. The narrator then quickly begins feeling ill and stumbles into a showroom where a crazy man shows him the crawling horrors suffusing the world invisible to the naked eye. Then it turns out that the crazy man was the scientist in question at the beginning, and also the drinking buddy had accidentally poisoned the narrator and so maybe (or maybe not) the whole thing was just a series of hallucinations...? This was a bad story. 1/5Franz Kafka, \u201cIn the Penal Colony,\u201d 1919 (translation, German/Czech) Another entirely natural and yet undeniably weird story about a visiting dignitary and the horrific torture machine at the heart of the titular colony. I\u2019m sure Foucauldian/biopolitics people have a field day with this punitive-inscribing-upon-the-body business, but I\u2019m not going to hold that against Kafka - this was a great story about the inhumanity of modernity, even if all I could picture the whole time was Count Tyrone Rugen. 5/5Stefan Grabinski, \u201cThe White Weyrak,\u201d 1921 (translation, Poland) Heroic chimney sweepers battle some sort of gremlin-y thing. Unmemorable. 2/5H.F. Arnold, \u201cThe Night Wire,\u201d 1926 Something goes bump in the night at a newspaper wire office when reports about an evil mist start pouring in from a town that appears not to exist. Creepy and inexplicable, I just wish this one was longer. 4/5H.P. Lovecraft, \u201cThe Dunwich Horror,\u201d 1929 A bit of an odd choice for the inevitable Lovecraft entry, because while this does have some sort of unspeakable twisted horror coalescing in a decaying backwater New England town, it also has a redoubtable hero who defeats said horror and emerges unscathed. Who wants an optimistic Lovecraft story? And yet - a great one-story primer on the mythos and the Necronomicon, so I don\u2019t know what other single story I would have preferred to see here instead, although I think \u201cThe Whisperer in Darkness\u201d is the one that has most stuck with me. 3.5/5Margaret Irwin, \u201cThe Book,\u201d 1930 The VanderMeers\u2019 introduction to this one made the point that this was one of the few ghost stories weird enough to be included in the volume. I\u2019m not so sure that I would call this a ghost story in the first place, but if you do, then I would say like 75% of the stories (so far anyway) fit the same criteria <12/10/11: just realized I already made this point regarding the second story in the anthology. oops). \u201cThe Book\u201d is about a book of Satanic rites that a bumbling white collar-type finds in a mysterious (haunted?) bookshelf that he has inherited, and the text of which changes to guide his business ventures, only to slowly reveal its more sinister side. No surprising developments here, but still very enjoyably creepy. 4/5Jean Ray, \u201cThe Mainz Psalter,\u201d 1930 (translation, Belgium) Jean Ray, \u201cThe Shadowy Street,\u201d 1931 (translation, Belgium) No real reason was given for the inclusion of two Ray stories back to back, but I\u2019m not going to complain because these were both absolutely fantastic (both senses of the word) and his stuff is very difficult to come by these days, I have now found. The former is a horrific story of seafaring and the latter is a horrific urban study, but both are surreal puzzles that seem not to have answers but which revolve around alternate dimensions and predatory invisible creatures and growing dread and terror and helplessness. Moreover many of old stories in the volume so far have relied on kind of awkward framing narratives, but Ray uses that technique to great effect. Also, I think \"The Shadowy Street\" is the first story in the collection to include an actual active woman character. I've sort of waffled back and forth regarding spoilers for the stories collected here but watching these unfold was too much fun to ruin for anyone - find and read these. 5/5Clark Ashton Smith, \u201cGenius Loci,\u201d 1933A haunted swamp story, notable only for its exploration of the seductive effect of the weird on the human mind. 2.5/5Hagiwara Sakutaro, \u201cThe Town of Cats,\u201d 1935 (translation, Japan)A prose poem about the weirdness of familiar locations when approached from a different direction. Meandering, overly introspective, and ultimately uninteresting. 2/5 Hugh Walpole, \u201cThe Tarn,\u201d 1936The second entry about a vengeful author, but this was much better than \"Casting the Runes.\" Our protagonist (it would be helpful for these reviews if I could ever remember character names but that is not something my brain is capable of, apparently) is a solitary, bitter man being visited by a much more successful author whose debut emerged at the same time as the protagonist's - unfairly, our man feels, killing off any interest in his book. Word of this dislike reaches the antagonist, who can't bear anyone to think ill of him, so he traipses out to intrude and tromp about on the protagonist's precious solitude by a remote tarn. Weird and horrific hijinks ensue - this is a great example of a seemingly mundane story slowly and inexorably becoming a weird one. 4/5Bruno Schulz, \u201cSanatorium at the Sign of the Hourglass,\u201d 1937 (translation, Poland)So I (tried to) read _Street of Crocodiles_ relatively recently and did not enjoy it at all - I found it kind of vacuous and meandering and entirely unengaging. This, on the other hand, I absolutely loved: a man visits his ailing father in a sanatorium where time has been tampered with in order to cheat death. The father may or may not be the only patient there, the son may or may not be losing his mind, nothing is as it seems, and then to top everything else off an army invades. Another excerpt that has me interested in finding and reading the entire work. 5/5Robert Barbour Johnson, \u201cFar Below,\u201d 1939Another purely pulpy work, which are proving less common than I would have expected. There are THINGS living in the deepest subway tunnels under NYC, and so the government attempts to contain them by focusing the powers of science and modernity. This doesn't exactly work out - but it doesn't exactly not work out either. 3/5Fritz Leiber, \u201cSmoke Ghost,\u201d 1941Following \"Far Below\" quite well thematically, why wouldn't modern ghosts be made up of exhaust and trash and factory soot and machinery? This I imagine was a historically important piece for the modernization of the haunting story, but the actual narrative here isn't particularly interesting and the climax/ending kind of betrays the setup anyway. 3/5Leonora Carrington, \u201cWhite Rabbits,\u201d 1941Better-written (much, much better-written) than the preceding story, but kind of similarly vignette-ish and image-based. Leprous zombies and carnivorous rabbits. 3/5Donald Wollheim, \u201cMimic,\u201d 1942To be honest, I had to look this one up to remind myself what it was about because I was drawing a complete blank - which tells you something about this piece, less a story than a quickly-jotted idea to the effect of \"many other species have some sort of rival or predator that mimics them, why not humans?\" 2.5/5Ray Bradbury, \u201cThe Crowd,\u201d 1943Ok I spoke too soon about the lack of pulp in here, I suppose. Crowds at car crashes gather quickly... a little TOO quickly, if you ask our protagonist here. 2.5/5William Sansom, \u201cThe Long Sheet,\u201d 1944Life, if you think about it, is like being trapped in a steel tunnel, with a wet sheet that you have to laboriously twist until dry in order to earn your freedom, only guards from above constantly shower you and the sheet with steam. 3.5/5Jorge Luis Borges, \u201cThe Aleph,\u201d 1945 (translation, Argentina)This has never been one of favorite Borges stories and I'm pretty bummed that it's the one that made the cut. I think a lot of that has to do with the interminable discussion of poetry in the first half? Really just about anything else would have been a better choice, although for my money \"The Garden of Forking Paths\" is unbeatable (also if you had asked me to guess which would be included here I probably would have said \"Tlon, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius,\" which does after all share with \"The Aleph\" the conceit that Borges-the-character is trying to root out some sort of weirdness, but what do I know). 3/5Olympe Bhely-Quenum, \u201cA Child in the Bush of Ghosts,\u201d 1949 (Benin)Kind of an inverted companion piece to the Lieber story, here instead of weird-as-symbol-of-the-modern we have weird-as-natural (natural-as-weird?), wherein a boy overcomes his fear of death by means of exposure to the spirit world. This had a folktale-ish vibe to it, and based on the shared-with-Tutuola idea of the \"Bush of Ghosts,\" I am going to go right ahead and assume that's what this story was based on. 4/5Shirley Jackson, \u201cThe Summer People,\u201d 1950I had confused this title with \"A Visit; or the Lovely House\" when I was about to read this one, and while that story would have fit the bill also, you can't really go wrong with Jackson. This story has such a perfect arc of creeping dread and slowly-intruding weirdness - it occurs to me that intrusion, either of the weird into reality or the rational into the irrational, is a central concern for all of this volume's selections. 5/5Margaret St. Clair, \u201cThe Man Who Sold Rope to the Gnoles,\u201d 1951A riff on the earlier gnoles story with a rope salesman instead of a burglar - a perfectly 1950s update, particularly when he is reading his salesman's manual for pointers on how to approach the client. Somehow manages to be simultaneously goofy and creepy/unsettling, the former of which is not so much my thing but I will admit that this was a lark. 3.5/5Robert Bloch, \u201cThe Hungry House,\u201d 1951Another haunted house story. Maybe that intro where they said there weren't many ghost stories was from an earlier draft of the collection? Typical setup: a young couple purchases (or rents? the story is kind of inconsistent on this) a house which has been vacant for a while, weird things happen, the backstory is filled in, typical haunted housery continues. An excellent build-up that faltered with the reveal and ensuing carnage - although reflections really are quite creepy, aren't they? 3.5/5Augusto Monterroso, \u201cMister Taylor,\u201d 1952 (new translation by Larry Nolen, Guatemala)There's an interesting dichotomy here between weird-for-the-sake-of-weird stories and stories where the weirdness is a more blatant thematic stand-in... for, say, American imperialism in Latin America, as reiminaged into the commodification of shrunken heads. Bananas or coca cola as shrunken heads - that's pretty weird, huh? 3/5... and I'm out of characters. To be continued in the comments, I guess."}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1345580-jim", "userReview": "I would rank this at the same exalted level as Manguel's excellent BLACK WATER anthologies - not just another horror anthology, but a true tribute to weird literature throughout the world. By turns tender and terrifying, straight-faced and satirical, graceful and grotesque, awe-inspiring and devastating, the stories in this wide-ranging volume are capable of producing one dizzying revelation after another, as they explore the height, depth and breadth of the unfettered human imagination."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/554401-mark", "userReview": "This is the most comprehensive and eclectic story collection of the sub-genre to date. Many will comment on this book\u2019s size. It is over a thousand pages of fairly small text, usually in two columns per page (Weird Tales style), 750 000 words of weirdness from writers in over eighteen different countries. There are stories that are known, stories that are much less known and some stories translated into English for the first time. A huge collection of stories and a variety of authors from all over the world, Ann and Jeff here not only try to show what they consider to be a collection of the best representations of the subgenre (if we can call it that) in the last one-hundred years but also try to show readers what weird fiction is, what are its origins and how it has developed. An ambitious target, but one which has been supremely realised. Of the old favourites, many will recognise: F. Marion Crawford, \u201cThe Screaming Skull,\u201d (1908) , Algernon Blackwood, \u201cThe Willows,\u201d (1907) , Saki, \u201cSredni Vashtar,\u201d (1910 ), M.R. James, \u201cCasting the Runes,\u201d (1911), H.P. Lovecraft, \u201cThe Dunwich Horror,\u201d (1929), Clark Ashton Smith, \u201cGenius Loci,\u201d (1933), Fritz Leiber, \u201cSmoke Ghost,\u201d (1941), Ray Bradbury, \u201cThe Crowd,\u201d (1943), Shirley Jackson, \u201cThe Summer People,\u201d (1950), Jerome Bixby, \u201cIt\u2019s a Good Life,\u201d (1953), Daphne Du Maurier, \u201cDon\u2019t Look Now,\u201d (1971), George R.R. Martin, \u201cSandkings,\u201d (1979), Stephen King, \u201cThe Man in the Black Suit,\u201d (1994) and China Mieville, \u201cDetails,\u201d (2002). All are good tales and as good as you could expect, as are stories by F. Paul Wilson, Clive Barker, Caitlin Kiernan, Lisa Tuttle, Garry Kilworth and many others.Where this collection really scores is that there is a lot here even the experienced expert will find new. Many of the tales have been translated from other languages, especially for this edition, and so were new to me. Authors I have heard of (Belgium\u2019s Jean Rey, for example) I was now reading for the first time. There\u2019s Kafka and Borges here, but new to me were France\u2019s Michel Bernanos, Spain\u2019s Merce Rodreda, Italy\u2019s Dino Buzzati and Japan\u2019s Ryunosuke Akyutagawa. What this confirmed to me was that there is an amazing world of the Fantastic beyond the English prose. The Weird, being in chronological order, also gives us glimpses into the latest \u2018new\u2019 weird writers: or should that be \u2018new, new weird\u2019, as the \u2018New Weird\u2019 grouping, if it ever existed, seems to date from the later1980\u2019s to early 1990\u2019s. Clearly names to look for in the future are Laird Barron, Steve Duffy and Reza Negarestani, many of whom I hadn\u2019t encountered until this volume. The final \u2018Afterweird\u2019 by China Mieville is as brain-stretching as I\u2019d expect.I haven\u2019t even tried to review the tales in depth here. I was pleased to read some old favourites but was more pleased to read stories I\u2019d never heard of before. Consequently there was a joy in just not knowing where a story was going to lead. There is enough here for everyone. It is awesomely weird. There are stories of drama, of fantastic mythology, of creepiness and unease, of tales in the past and ones that might just be happening now.Even in such a major-sized tome there are omissions, some because of space, some because the editors couldn\u2019t get the permissions. (I\u2019ll mention Thomas Disch, JG Ballard and Arthur Machen, for example.) But these are minor quibbles, considering what is covered. This is essential for anyone with a remote interest in what readers see in weird fiction. It covers the width, breadth and depth of what readers might see as the sub-genre, as well as no doubt some other dimensions usually beyond the traditional three. It has taken me nearly two months to read this, but it has been an amazing read. This is a book to wallow in, to delve into, to pick stories from at random. It is a book once read, readers will keep coming back to, and have since finishing it the first time.As is the book\u2019s remit would suggest, not every story will be well liked, not every tale will be understood. It will cause debate, and I suspect will be high on \u2018the best of\u2019 lists at the end of the year. I think already it is one of mine."}, {"userName": "Sofia Samatar", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2467435-sofia-samatar", "userReview": "I cannot even.

As far as a humongous collection of weird tales, it just don't get better than this, folks. Seriously. Even considering the 1152 double-columned pages, its heft (not at all comfortable for reading in bed) and the couple of months it took me to get through this weighty tome, it was all worth it. While every anthology has a few stories that a reader's not going to like, overall this one is a 5/5 star collection, worth every moment it took to read and certainly worth every penny I spent on it. That was last year, when you could actually still buy one new -- now if you want the hardcover edition, it's in the hands of secondhand sellers. Luckily there are now both paperback editions and one for the e-reader. It's monumental, it's epic and well, it's the ultimate weird collection!!China Mi\u00e9ville writes in the book's \"afterweird\" that \"In this book is a Weird Canon. It is not exactly yours -- how could it be? We don't fray the world quite the same, and different things watch each of us...Weird travels with us, each reader a Typhoid Mary in every library.\" He's so right. My cup of tea in terms of the weird may not be someone else's, but in this book, there's a wide enough of a variety that will show you, when all is said and done, just which waters of the weird you'd like to continue to navigate. For me, there are only a handful that weren't really up my alley -- mainly (but not limited to) the ones with more of a \"weird science\" edge. One of my favorite books of 2013, I recommend it to anyone who loves weird fiction or even better, to anyone who's read a few examples of the craft and wants to know where to turn next. It is, in a word, excellent. If you want to see my brief descriptions on each story in table of contents order, just click  here.

Edited by Ann and Jeff VanderMeer, Master and Mistress of Weird, The Weird is 1126 pages long and should really be considered a textbook of weird fiction. It contains 110 carefully chosen stories spanning more than 100 years of weird fiction. Here\u2019s what you can expect to find in this massive volume:A \u201cForweird\u201d by Michael Moorcock gives us a brief history of the weird tale, discusses how it has defied publishers\u2019 attempts to categorize it into neatly-bordered genres, and gives examples of writers who are revered by modern readers but whose weird fiction caused them to be marginalized during their lifetimes. Moorcock also attempts to explain why we like weird fiction and relates the affinity for strange tales, at one time or other, to the popularity of psychoanalysis, the development of easily-consumed mass communication, and the desire to rock the literary boat once in a while when genres become staid. Or, Moorcock suggests, perhaps we just occasionally like to be disturbed.Next, Ann and Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s introduction begins to define \u201cWeird\u201d by reminding us of H.P. Lovecraft\u2019s 1927 definition: \u201csomething more than secret murder, bloody bones, or a sheeted form clanking chains.\u201d The VanderMeers suggest that weird stories are dark and make us uneasy, but can at the same time be beautiful. They also discusses the influences of surrealism, Decadent Literature, New Wave and Gothic and then offers a detailed history and evolution of the weird tale with recommended authors and stories (most of which are included in this volume).Then come the stories \u2014 110 of them arranged chronologically starting with stories from 1907 and 1908 from Alfred Kubin, F. Marion Crawford, and Algernon Blackwood and ending in 2010 with a story by K.J. Bishop. In between are stories by men and women from all over the world including Lord Dunsany, Abraham Merritt, Franz Kafka, H.P. Lovecraft, Clark Ashton Smith, Fritz Leiber, Ray Bradbury, Jorge Luis Borges, Shirley Jackson, Robert Bloch, Mervyn Peake, Daphne du Maurier, James Triptree Jr., George R.R. Martin, M.

Each story is introduced with a paragraph explaining the author\u2019s credentials, awards, and influence in the field.Last comes an \u201cAfterweird\u201d by China Mi\u00e9ville which is just weird enough to deserve a place in this anthology. Mi\u00e9ville, not surprisingly, discusses the etymology of the word \u201cWEIRD\u201d and, as he recaps some of the unsettling things we\u2019ve encountered in this compendium, wonders how useful etymology is when defining something as \u201cweird.\u201d Instead, he suggests that weird is personal, state-dependent, and \u201cWe know it when we feel it.\u201d Lastly, Mi\u00e9ville proposes that \u201cweird\u201d is contagious, infecting your brain and the stories you read from now on.The Weird: A Compendium of Strange and Dark Stories is not meant to be read front to back all at once, but is rather more like a manual or primer in the scholarly field of Weird Fiction. I read many of the stories (most of them were stories I had not previously read) and familiarized myself with a few authors I\u2019d never heard of before. I look forward to reading all of these weird tales eventually and I\u2019m glad to have this text on my shelf. The Weird: A Compendium of Strange and Dark Stories deserves a place on every speculative fiction lover\u2019s bookshelf.

Food TV program (if not, basically some idiot attempts to eat an 40oz steak or 3ft pizza or something\u2026) but I've just finished reading The Weird, a vast (100+ stories, 750000 words) anthology of weird fiction put together by Jeff and Ann VanderMeer.\u201cThe publishers believe this is the largest volume of weird fiction ever housed between the covers of one book\u201d the blurb says, as if there\u2019s any doubt\u2026Just the physical size of the book is somewhat imposing, especially when you see the double-columns of small type inside. I've been reading this on and off since January, and part of the reason it has taken so long is that its pretty much impossible to read this book (in its non-ebook version) on public transport or in bed. It\u2019s just too heavy and unwieldy.But unlike those huge steaks (I imagine) The Weird doesn't let quantity get in the way of quality. Given the sheer number of selections there\u2019s no way people will love every one, but there\u2019s not a story here that\u2019s anything less that interesting to the horror fiction aficionado. I don\u2019t think any anthology before this one has stories spanning such a range before, whether in time (the oldest story is from 1908; the newest 2010); geography (stories from twenty countries across the globe, some in translation for the first time); or genre (traditional horror rubs shoulders with science-fiction, literary fiction, fantasy and even humour).Some of the stories I had read before \u2013 and it\u2019s always a pleasure to read The Willows or The Hospice again. But many others were brand new to me; of those that I've not read before these were my favourites:Hanns Heinz Ewers, \u201cThe Spider,\u201dH.F. Arnold, \u201cThe Night Wire,\u201dClark Ashton Smith, \u201cGenius Loci,\u201dRobert Barbour Johnson, \u201cFar Below,\u201dWilliam Sansom, \u201cThe Long Sheet,\u201dRobert Bloch, \u201cThe Hungry House,\u201dJerome Bixby, \u201cIt\u2019s a Good Life,\u201dCharles Beaumont, \u201cThe Howling Man,\u201dMervyn Peake, \u201cSame Time, Same Place,\u201dGahan Wilson, \u201cThe Sea Was Wet As Wet Could Be,\u201dDennis Etchison, \u201cIt Only Comes Out at Night,\u201dJames Tiptree Jr. (Alice Sheldon), \u201cThe Psychologist Who Wouldn\u2019t Do Awful Things to Rats,\u201dGeorge R.R. Martin, \u201cSandkings,\u201dWilliam Gibson/John Shirley, \u201cThe Belonging Kind,\u201dJoanna Russ, \u201cThe Little Dirty Girl,\u201dF. Paul Wilson, \u201cSoft,\u201dGarry Kilworth, \u201cHogfoot Right and Bird-hands,\u201dLucius Shepard, \u201cShades,\u201dJoyce Carol Oates, \u201cFamily,\u201dKaren Joy Fowler, \u201cThe Dark,\u201dLisa Tuttle, \u201cReplacements,\u201dWilliam Browning Spenser, \u201cThe Ocean and All Its Devices,\u201dCraig Padawer, \u201cThe Meat Garden,\u201dChina Mieville, \u201cDetails,\u201dBrian Evenson, \u201cThe Brotherhood of Mutilation,\u201dMargo Lanagan, \u201cSinging My Sister Down,\u201dSteve Duffy, \u201cIn the Lion\u2019s Den,\u201dK.J. Bishop, \u201cSaving the Gleeful Horse,\u201dBut that\u2019s not to belittle the quality of the others.In my opinion The Weird sets a new standard for an anthology of \u2018weird fiction\u2019 \u2013 as well as the stories themselves, the Introductions and Afterwords are thought-provoking, and as if the book itself wasn't enough there\u2019s a whole website called The Weird Fiction review with articles, interviews and fiction by many of the authors.In short, if you\u2019re a horror fiction fan with a taste for the weirder, more articulate or surreal side of the genre, this is pretty much a must-read."}, {"userName": "Paula Cappa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12942555-paula-cappa", "userReview": "What's missing in this horror compendium? See if you can guess. If you are a horror short story lover as I am, this is the anthology to have on your shelf. That is, if you have the space as this volume is bigger and heavier than Stephen King's colossal Under the Dome, and quite boxy to read on your lap (I used a pillow to offset the weight). What I liked about this compendium is the range of time it covers for horror stories. Not only the master horror writers like Blackwood, Lovecraft, MR James but some not so well known like Jean Ray, Luigi Ugolini, Bruno Schulz. The Vandermeers have stories here from 1908 to 2010 with over 100 authors in the genre. Since there's so many here that are worthy of comment, I'll quickly sight the Jean Ray stories from the 1930s as stories you should not miss (and can't read anywhere online). F.Marion Crawford's The Screaming Skull will still entertain you even though it was written in 1908. Claude Seignolle's The Ghoulbird, and The Hungry House by Robert Bloch are a couple of my oldie favorites. For more contemporary authors Michael Chabon, Caitlin R. Kiernan, Kelly Link, Thomas Ligotti, Joyce Carole Oates, Daphne du Maurier.I couldn't help notice that not a single one of Mary Shelley's short stories was included in this compendium, and she wrote about 18 shorts. Nor will you find Anne Rice's \"Master of Rampling Gate.\" which is, I think, her only short story to date but with over 20 novels in this genre. No Gertrude Barrows Bennett's fiction, who is said to have invented dark fantasy (wrote 8 short stories) and influenced Lovecraft. Maybe there are copyright issues going on, but a compendium (a body of knowledge) without Shelley and Rice? A little bit of a hole here, I think. Still, The Weird is an ambitious and valuable source."}, {"userName": "Julie Davis", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2125014-julie-davis", "userReview": "It's October. Of course I'm reading something like this.Much to my own surprise I have developed a real love of weird fiction over the last few years. (I blame the H.P. Lovecraft Literary Podcast.)This collection contains short stories and novellas in chronological order, from around the world. I'd already read the earliest, classic stories included but was really pleased at the selections. (Ahem - so the VanderMeers had the good taste to agree with MY taste. Yes, I realize the judgment call there, but we've gotta draw those lines somewhere, right?)I'm really looking forward to seeing what I discover here, especially in exploring the weird tales from other cultures.UPDATEI'm marking this as finished, though I haven't actually finished it ... but I am so weirded out by reading nothing but weird fiction that I'm going to be the subject of a Lovecraft story if I don't switch to something else.

Such is the case here.However, I discovered that my ebook version is missing the story \"The Colomber\" by Dino Buzzati. I informed amazon, and they replied that they are working with the publisher on the problem, and they will not be selling the ebook until the problem is solved.This book is a collection of weird stories that were published in over the past 100 years , written by authors world-wide. Weird fiction is an amorphous category; it is not just supernatural horror, but but can be science fiction, fantasy, literary surrealism , and absurdism. I'll venture a theory about this stuff: it is about the encounter of a menacing supra- or ir-real. The previously mentioned story \"The Colomber\", which is a fine story, is about a sailor stalked by a sea creature invisible to everybody except to the said sailor. In \"The Night Wire\" (1926) by H.F. Arnold, the narrator who is a news reporter recounts how his fellow reporter got wire dispatches of a fog enveloping a city, shrieks and cries coming from the fog, and lights swirling around the fog. Now this story is a find! Plot driven, entertaining, and well written, this story approaches my ideal for short fiction. This volume also contains the story \"The Aleph\" by Jorge Luis Borges. Though I don't think this story really fits here. The Aleph is something that I would actually like to encounter. Borges \"The Zahir\" might be a better choice. \"Axolotl\" (1956) by Julio Cortazar is here, but I think a better story of his is \"House Taken Over.\" Other fine stories in this volume by Kafka, Shirley Jackson, Jean Ray, Ramsay Campbell, Harlan Ellison, Thomas Ligotti, H.P.

It's like a thousand pages long, but each page has at least two of a normal books amount of words on it. So this is really like a two thousand page book. It's going to take awhile to get through. Some of the stories in this collection are actually novellas, and some of them are available on their own. When they are I'm going to review them on their own and just link to them. That way I'll save space in this review, and get to inflate the number of books I've read and reviews I've written. Win, win, win. Alfred Kubin - The Other Side (3 stars)An excerpt from a novel. All but one of the people of a city fall asleep and when they wake up animals have begun to populate the town. Sounds like a great set up for a novel, right? I'm curious to read the rest of this, although Mariel described it as so boring that she could see the nerves on the back of her eyes so maybe I won't be trying to full novel anytime soon. Kubin ran in some of the same circles as Kafka and there are similarities, especially in say the tiger scene. Or maybe it was all the rage in Eastern Europe at the time to have tigers stalking around inside of government buildings and churches.F. Marion Crawford - Screaming Skull (2 stars)http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...Algernon Blackwood - The Willows (3 stars)http://www.goodreads.com/review/show/...Saki - Sredni Vashtar (4 stars)The shortest of the stories so far in the collection and the most satisfying. Any story that features a polecat-ferret being worshipped as a god is good with me. Plus there is no unspeakable horrors or overly psychological melodrama in this one. M. R. James - Casting the Runes(4 stars)The story is fairly typical for the genre, but I could be just projecting from the benefit of reading this a hundred and one years after it was first published. I'm fairly sure that the basic structure was used in at least one of Joss Whedon's TV shows. What was more interesting than the story was some of the story-telling techniques used, which are also fairly common today but have a post-modern / meta-fiction thing sort of going on. I was happy with this story.Lord Dunsany - How Nuth Would Have Practised His Art Upon the Gnoles (3 stars)Not that I've read many O. Henry stories, but this is kind of what I'd expect him to write if he was going to write about a thief robbing emeralds from some of scary Fae in Ireland. If I were an English teacher I'd probably want to use this story to discuss the role of a narrator in a short-story, I'm not though, and I'm trying to keep these mini-reviews short, so I'll just make mention that the narrator is a peculiar choice for this story and the question of reliability can be brought up.Gustav Meyrink - The Man in the Bottle(2 stars)I think me and Gustav just don't get along. I think that a film adaptation of this story could be awesome, but as a story it left me really cold. George Heym - The Dissection(3 Stars)A short story / poem about a body being dissected by doctors. There are some great gruesome images but I didn't quite see the point in turning it to a 'story' instead of keeping it as a poem. Georg Heym - The Spider(4 Stars)I'd never read of Heym before, apparently he flirted with the Nazi's for a while in their initial rise to power and then broke ties with them over the Jewish Question and their opinions on homosexuals. The Nazi's banned his books as a result and ruined him. Posterity then continued to ruin him by forever equating him with his brief affair with Hitler and company. I enjoyed this story even though it sort of runs the same trail as some of the earlier stories in this book that I didn't care for so much. The rational scientific man gets caught up with super-natural forces that he wants to have a physical explanation for but eventually realizes that they are beyond anything he can explain. This story makes me think that I like the premises of this type of story but it's the writing style that is keeping me from really enjoying some of these writers. This was a good one. Rabindranath Tagore - The Hungry Stones(2 Stars)Luigi Ugolini - The Vegetable Man(3 Stars)A. Merritt - The People of the Pit(3 Stars)Ryunosuke Akutagawa - The Hell Screen(4 Stars)Francis Stevens - Unseen-Unfeared(3 Stars)Franz Kafka - In the Penal Colony(5 Stars)Stefan Grabinski - The White Wyrak(4 Stars)After a four month 'rest', I forgot to review and rate some books. Oh, well. Maybe I'll go back and four stories I forgot to rate, and maybe even review these other stories I got distracted from writing about.Jean Ray - The Shadowy Street(2.5 Stars)Blah, I wasn't too impressed by this one. It had some of the same features of other stories, the structure of the narrative being told as a 'found manuscript', some of the stylistic flourishes of the 'old school' horror writers. I'm thinking that this book is going to get better for me soon as we move into the 1930's and soon leave behind the 19th century influences. What is scarier than this story? The four military people singing \"God Bless America\" during the seventh inning stretch of the fourth game of the 2012 World Series.

It's by far the biggest anthology I've ever encountered and I'm not ashamed to say that it took me a number of years to finally get through the thing. The collection is themed chronologically, beginning with many established classics of the genre before moving into new and unexplored territory.Kubin's THE OTHER SIDE opens this collection, but I'm not a huge fan of novel excerpts as I find the lack of context a bit disconcerting. F. Marion Crawford's THE SCREAMING SKULL is a much better bet, a classic ghost story inspired by a real-life haunting. Algernon Blackwood's THE WILLOWS is a mini-masterpiece in cosmic horror, one I found almost Lovecraftian, although of course Blackwood wrote it before Lovecraft came to fame. SREDNI VASHTAR is an oddball little story about a ferret by Saki, and never quite what you'd expect. M.R. James' CASTING THE RUNES is totally unlike the rest of his fiction, a fast-paced thriller with some truly sinister villains.Lord Dunsany's HOW NUTH WOULD HAVE PRACTISED HIS ART UPON THE GNOLES is another bizarre one, not really horror but certainly full of imagination. Gustav Meyrink's THE MAN IN THE BOTTLE has a fairy tale atmosphere and does the job well enough, but Georg Heym's THE DISSECTION doesn't really go anywhere that interesting. Thankfully, Hans Heinz Ewers' THE SPIDER is an old favourite of mine, a meticulously-crafted effort that never fails to provoke a chill. THE HUNGRY STONES by Rabindranath Tagore is a traditional haunted house fable with a touch of eastern exoticism, while THE VEGETABLE MAN by Luigi Ugolini has one of my favourite themes in horror fiction \u2013 the killer plant!A. Merritt's THE PEOPLE OF THE PIT is another proto-Lovecraft effort, and quite exceptional, a tale of the weird wilderness that really works. Then there's Ryonusuke Akutagawa's THE HELL SCREEN, a long-acknowledged classic of its type, a near-perfect Japanese ghost story that's magnificently grotesque. Francis Stevens is an unknown writer these days, but her UNSEEN \u2013 UNFEARED has something uniquely ghastly about it. Then there's Franz Kafka's IN THE PENAL COLONY, which offers a different kind of horror: cold, clinical, political. Stefan Grabinski's THE WHITE WYRAK offers a slice of Polish folklore that's effectively chilly, while H.F. Arnold's THE NIGHT WIRE is an excellent piece of pulp horror and a forerunner to Herbert's THE FOG and King's THE MIST. Next up is THE DUNWICH HORROR, by Lovecraft of course, and this tale's inclusion needs little explanation; it's still a masterpiece even if you've read it before.THE BOOK, by Margaret Irwin, is a differently-paced ghost story and sure to alarm any collector of weird fiction. Jean Ray's THE MAINZ PSALTER is a masterful story of weirdness at sea, full of imagination and surreal moments. THE SHADOWY STREET, by the same author, is a vampire story and very nearly as excellent. Then there's GENIUS LOCI, by the great Clark Ashton Smith, which explores how an outdoor location could be haunted by something unseen and uncanny; it's magnificently disturbing. Hagiwara Sakutaro's THE TOWN OF CATS is disappointingly mundane by comparison. Hugh Walpole's THE TARN is much like GENIUS LOCI, albeit colder and more cerebral, while Bruno Schulz's SANATORIUM UNDER THE SIGN OF THE HOURGLASS I found insufferably abstract. Still, Robert Barbour Johnson's FAR BELOW is another masterpiece, bringing to mind such filmed delights as DEATH LINE and C.H.U.D.Fritz Leiber makes the most of an industrial backdrop for his SMOKE GHOST, a solid spin on traditional subjects. Leonora Carrington's WHITE RABBITS is more bizarre, anecdotal in fact. MIMIC, by Donald A. Wollheim, was memorably made into a film by Guillermo del Toro back in the day, and in print it's just as oddball. Meanwhile, Ray Bradbury's THE CROWD is an expert account of social alienation. William Sansom's THE LONG SHEET is a terrifying look at the world of crime and punishment, while THE ALEPH by Jorge Luis Borges is hard to read but completely alien and imaginative. A CHILD IN THE BUSH OF GHOSTS is by Beninese writer Olympe Bhely-Quenum and totally bizarre and unsettling; I found it worked a treat. Shirley Jackson's THE SUMMER PEOPLE works well for being so restrained and subtle when it comes to the horrors. Margaret St. Clair's THE MAN WHO SOLD ROPE TO THE GNOLES is one of those snappy twist-in-the-tale efforts, while Robert Bloch's THE HUNGRY HOUSE is a tremendously sinister spin on the traditional haunted house story.THE COMPLETE GENTLEMAN, by Amos Tutuola, has some good ghastly content, but the writing style feels a bit limited. 'IT'S A GOOD LIFE' sees Jerome Bixby tackling small town horror in a way that Stephen King would, and it's a nicely-constructed piece of writing with some unforeseen twists. Head-hunting is explored in MISTER TAYLOR by Augusto Monterroso in a political fashion, but Julio Cortazar's AXOLOTL fails to make a cute creature in any way frightening. William Sansom's A WOMAN SELDOM FOUND is mildly racy and short and to the point. Charles Beaumont's THE HOWLING MAN feels a bit mundane but everything is turned on its head with a good twist at the end. SAME TIME, SAME PLACE sees Meryn Peake delivering a romantic story with a weird twist. Dino Buzzati THE COLOMBER is a fully atmospheric story of seafaring and mystery that works a treat, while Michel Bernanos' THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN is even better, starting out as a sea story before moving into an otherworldly adventure yarn.THE SALAMANDER by Merce Rodoreda has some good ideas but little in the way of satisfactory plot development. Claude Seignolle's THE GHOULBIRD is even briefer, but lovers of zoology will enjoy it. Gahan Wilson's THE SEA WAS AS WET AS WET COULD BE takes ALICE THROUGH THE LOOKING GLASS as its starting point for a story of the drunken and the unpleasant. Then, of course, there's Daphne du Maurier's DON'T LOOK NOW, which is very nearly as good as the classic Nic Roeg film that they made from it. THE HOSPICE is a famed 'strange story' from Robert Aickman that also works a treat, while Dennis Etchison's IT ONLY COMES OUT AT NIGHT is a slice of American pulp that pays off nicely.At this point in the anthology I found a big drop in quality as I discovered that I'm not really a fan of modernist, abstract stylings so many of the following stories left me cold. James Tiptree Jr.'s THE PSYCHOLOGIST WHO WOULDN'T DO AWFUL THINGS TO RATS is a nasty, cold and mechanical effort. THE BEAK DOCTOR, by Eric Basso, is as repulsive as it is boring, while Jamaica Kincaid's MY MOTHER is a simple flight of fancy with a few effective passages. Next up are no less than four five star stories in a row. George R.R. Martin's SANDKINGS I remember seeing adapted for THE OUTER LIMITS, but this is even better than the filmed version; sheer excellence. Bob Leman's WINDOW starts out as an ordinary time travel tale before turning into something hair-raisingly horrible. Ramsey Campbell's THE BROOD is an expert study of urban decay, both subtle and profound, while Michael Shea's THE AUTOPSY is unique, unusual, and brilliant.William Gibson's THE BELONGING KIND is pure science fiction with some oddball elements. M. John Harrison's EGNARO is a surprisingly literate exploration of social decay and psychological madness; another one that hits home, hard. Joanna Russ' THE LITTLE DIRTY GIRL is overwritten by self-conscious by comparison. THE NEW RAYS is also by Harrison, not quite as vivid as EGNARO but still worth a look. Premendra Mitra's THE DISCOVERY OF TELENAPOTA is wistful but abstract, and not to my taste. SOFT is by F. Paul Wilson and as memorably ghastly as anything the author has written (except perhaps BUCKETS). Octavia E. Butler's BROODCHILD has a good premise but the dialogue and descriptions don't really mix. IN THE HILLS, THE CITIES sees Clive Barker on top imaginative form for a story which shouldn't really work but somehow does. Leena Krohn's TAINARON: MAIL FROM ANOTHER CITY is a weird novella from a Finnish author, but long-winded and bogged down by endless mundane descriptive passages.Garry Kilworth's HOGFOOT RIGHT AND BIRD-HANDS is brief, ghastly, and vindictive. Lucius Shepherd's SHADES is a limited ghost story that nonetheless explores well the psychological effects of trauma in the Vietnam War. Harlan Ellison's THE FUNCTION OF DREAM SLEEP is an ice-cold story reminiscent of David Cronenberg at his most clinical. Ben Okri's WORLDS THAT FLOURISH has a protagonist disassociated and at the menace of an alien society, and works nicely. Not so THE BOY IN THE TREE, a story by Elizabeth Hand that has potential but which was too obtuse for me to properly enjoy. FAMILY sees Joyce Carol Oates looking at a truly grotesque family, but the stand-out in this section is Poppy Z. Brite's HIS MOUTH WILL TASTE OF WORMWOOD, which I read before but still impresses on a second reading: hugely gothic, full of rich description, like an Anne Rice novel but better. Michal Ajvaz's THE END OF THE GARDEN is unreadable by comparison.Karen Joy Fowler's THE DARK ties together disparate elements in an unexpectedly effective little effort, but Kathe Koja's ANGELS IN LOVE is too obsessed by sex and fails to create an interesting story to go with it. As for the Murakami story, I found THE ICE MAN to be a big fuss about nothing; I'm not sure what the point of it all was. Lisa Tuttle's REPLACEMENTS is much better, an exploration of alienation written in a subtle way. Marc Laidlaw's THE DIANE ARBUS SUICIDE PORTFOLIO has some grace and artistry in an otherwise nasty little story, while Steven Utley's THE COUNTRY DOCTOR is stand-out good, queasy stuff indeed. Martin Simpson's LAST RITES AND RESURRECTIONS feels like a weak re-tread of Stephen King's PET SEMATARY, but William Browning Spencer's THE OCEAN AND ALL ITS DEVICES is pleasingly old-fashioned and Lovecraftian in scope. Jeffrey Ford's THE DELICATE seems to have been written at speed and made up as the author went along.THE MAN IN THE BLACK SUIT is the inevitable Stephen King story, not perhaps one of his best, although it does have a very good depiction of childhood that the author is always good at. As for Angela Carter's THE SNOW PAVILION, I couldn't get on with it at all. Craig Padawer's THE MEAT GARDEN is a clever story of a war between man and plant, but nothing more than a series of endless descriptive passages. Stepan Chapman's THE STIFF AND THE STILE takes a children's song and turns it grotesque, but is a bit obvious for my liking. However, Tanith Lee's YELLOW AND RED is an enjoyably old-fashioned haunted house story that mixes a couple of old tropes to good effect. It's much better than Kelly Link's THE SPECIALIST'S HAT, which is certainly weird but all but unreadable too. A REDRESS FOR ANDROMEDA sees Caitlin R. Kiernan in Lovecraftian territory again, but things become a little too abstract at the climax for me. THE GOD OF DARK LAUGHTER, by Michael Chabon, is once more a Lovecraftian story, full of unanswered questions and grisly mystery; very good it is too.China Mieville's DETAILS has a simple story but effective execution, although the mystery is slight. THE GENIUS OF ASSASSINS, by Michael Cisco, is horribly written and overlong to boot. Neil Gaiman's FEEDERS AND EATERS is a straightforward vampire story of the kind you'd find in an old Pan Book of Horror. Jeff VanderMeer, the editor of this book, contributes THE CAGE, which has a decent subject matter but poor execution. Jeffrey Ford's THE BEAUTIFUL GELREESH is very silly and unreadable too. Thomas Ligotti does better with THE TOWN MANAGER, a politically-themed story of social decay; it's not the best from him, but for a story at the end of this anthology it stands out. Brian Evenson's THE BROTHERHOOD OF MUTILATION is a murder mystery with a ghastly setting that also packs a punch. Even better is THE WHITE HANDS by Mark Samuels, a supremely old-fashioned story of gothic dread, steeped in the best traditions of Poe, Lovecraft, and their ilk. Daniel Abraham's FLAT DIANE is pure nonsense, unfortunately, while Margo Lanagan's SINGING MY SISTER DOWN is brief and to the point. T.M. Wright's THE PEOPLE ON THE ISLAND has some ghastly imagery but little plot to it, while Laird Barron's THE FOREST is saddled with unlikeable characters and a pretentious writing style.THE HIDE, by Liz Williams, has an effectively desolate locale that the birdwatchers among us will enjoy. Reza Negarestani's DUST ENFORCER isn't a story at all, but rather some details about a Middle Eastern desert demon. THE FAMILIARS, by Micaela Morrisette, is a tale of a mother, a boy, and the imaginary creature that lives with them, but written in the present tense which always puts me off a bit. THE LION'S DEN is by Steve Duffy and has some bizarre stuff taking place at a zoo; it's properly disquieting. Stephen Graham Jones's LITTLE LAMBS is a story of madness which is too abstract and overwritten for me. Finally, K.J. Bishop's SAVING THE GLEEFUL HORSE is another one that I could make no headway with."}, {"userName": "Adam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1879990-adam", "userReview": "Having already decided not to review each story individually, I'm not sure what the best tack for discussing this collection is, so I'm just gonna hit a few random points. I can't comment on how good the curation is, because of the same ignorance of the genre that made it worth reading in the first place. I found it quite valuable in filling that gap; I still don't have a very solid idea of the overall state of the genre at any given time, but I'm much more familiar with the general arc of its development. Some general points of note:- The book spans about a century of publishing, and before around the 40s-50s, it seems like nobody in the genre knew how to write enjoyable fiction. The first third is a slog of overlong, unsatisfying, unimaginative, and dry stories, broken up only by a couple standouts (Saki and Kafka). Things get better from there but I'd still say the majority of stories are not great until like the 90s. - Even recently a lot of these stories are just too . . . stylistically ambitious, to put it nicely. . . to be really satisfying to me. They go beyond narrative ambiguity to an obfuscatory prose or nigh-on random sensibility that interferes with storytelling and doesn't give all that much in return. The peak of this by far is Negarestani; I was hoping to see what kind of work he'd do in short fiction but his entry is just an excerpt from Cyclonopedia, which stinks. Cisco, Kiernan, and Wright suffer from the same problem to varying extents, though. Most of the rest are just plain old mediocre, which is a bit surprising given the volume of stories they were drawing from in more recent decades (the Angela Carter entry seems uncharacteristically bad, for instance, and Jeff VanderMeer's bit fell totally flat to me even though I love his writing in Area X). Guess that's a matter of taste, though. - Lovecraft gets all the popular attention as the progenitor of The Weird but this collection, intentionally or not, makes his Grand, Fantastical weird a footnote to a genre more often defined by subtle uncanniness, a thing of tone and style as much as cosmic scale. This means that the Lovecraft school of Weird barely makes an appearance, and it's not clear how much that distorts the picture of the genre's development in general; presumably there are other anthologies that fill out that stream more directly. Jean Ray, Bernanos, Browing Spencer, and Kiernan are the only authors who really feel Lovecraftian per se in this collection.- The collection has a fair number of interesting international writers in the early-middle section especially, but the last couple decades feel surprisingly sparse on that front; only 5 international stories after 1990 and two of those are from Australia. I was disappointed because the earlier intl authors are more interesting than Euro-american writers from the same period but suffer from some of the same quality flaws and presumably there are writers out there now doing contemporary-quality work in those traditions.- I think I had already intuited this a bit, but this collection makes it very clear that where the morally (and narratively) ambiguous, ecologically-minded dark fantasy stuff I'm interested in writing is an aberration in fantasy, it's a core thread in Weird fiction. There's more than a dozen stories here that are little more than case studies on the ecology and habits of some creature, from Heinz Ewers' The Spider and Ugolini's Vegetable Man to The White Weyrak to Martin's Sandkings, and on to Jeffrey Ford's Gelreesh. Wollheim's Mimic lays out a whole ecology of such creatures, which Campbell's The Brood and to lesser extent, The Belonging Kind, iterate on. There's also a tradition of something analogous to the Mushishi premise, where the protagonist is an investigator and the weird phenomenon builds through their process (in Chabon's God of Dark Laughter, Karen Joy Fowler's The Dark, and Utley's The Country Doctor, for instance). - Similarly, nature comes up as a source of inspiration and flavor a fair bit, maybe not necessarily more than in fantasy but perhaps less superficially? There are a number of stories (several of those already mentioned, but also Williams' The Hide and Kiernan's Redress for Andromeda) that use natural history as part of their protagonist's lens on the world. Others turn to nature for more explicit imagery. The Willows and Ashton Smith's Genius Loci both make an unassuming natural scene the vehicle and almost the whole identity of its creepy phenomena. Leena Krohn's Tainaron is an extensive exploration of insect ecology concepts as weird premises, though it isn't very satisfying--a disappointment but at least my niche is still wide open. There's also a few stories that use parasitism. The Gelreesh is arguably a parasitoid as much as a predator, and Shea's The Autopsy is a competent, if straightforward, treatment of the boring old non-host-specific alien mind control parasite. Octavia Butler's Bloodchild is the first story I've seen that uses a human parasitoid as the premise for a complex society, and while it has its flaws, it's got some great body horror stuff and I was pleased to see some proof that the premise has legs. - It's hard to judge authors from single stories but I didn't come out of this super hot on many new authors. I should probably hit up more short stories/etc from Shirley Jackson, GRRM, Joanna Russ, Octavia Butler, Michael Shea, Joyce Carol Oates, Clive Barker, and Jeffrey Ford. Other than their entries, some of my favorite stories were Micaela Morrissette's The Familiars, Evenson's Brotherhood of Mutilation, Padawer's The Meat Garden, Ligotti's The Town Manager (rather surprising given my past experiences with Ligotti), Link's The Specialist's Hat, Browning Spencer's The Ocean and all its Devices, and Saki's Sredni Vashtar. - This is an inevitable problem, but it's a shame some of the best recent writers didn't make it in here; John Langan surely ought to be included, and probably Tanzer and Ballingrud too. And maybe SGJ could have had a better entry (not that Little Lambs is bad). Barron's entry is definitely not my favorite of his work, but apparently that's just me so idk. But once you open that door there's a ton of recent weird stories I like better than lots of these so it's hard to know what's taste and editing for \"influence\" at some point.- The cover art is ugly and a far more blunt statement on the nature of the Weird (Gothic+Tentacles) than the book suggests in its introductory materials or the story selection itself."}, {"userName": "Res", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56479-res", "userReview": "I didn't realize this was the canonical collection.

And this is easily one of the best horror anthologies I've ever read. It's both entertaining and informative to see how the \"weird tale\" has changed over time, it seems to me we are living in the best time for weird fiction in probably half a century.It's true not everything here is a masterpiece, I didn't care for many of the non-western weird stories which seemed to go nowhere, nor for the far more bizarre stories which appear occasionally. But these are typically short. But the Vandermeer's aren't afraid to include several novellas that are in the 20k+ word range. Many of these stories challenge the reader but I always looked forward to diving into whatever was next, and was consistently rewarded.I'm only reviewing the best I put a \"+\" beside those that I consider the most exceptional here.The Screaming Skull - F. Marion Crawford - Read this story years ago, very atmospheric, fireside type tale. A man tells how he is haunted by a skull which seems to move by itself, returns when thrown away, and has a wickedly malefic temprament.The Willows - Algernon Blackwood - Lovecraft considered it the best \"weird tale\" ever written, certainly it does subtly, yet effectively get at a very outre-ness. Two men stranded on a small island in the Danube River find themselves dogged by an unseen, alien force.The Spider - Hanns Heinz Ewers - VERY good weird tale, certainly it\u2019s \u201cweird\u201d in every sense of the word, but also scary, smart and despite it\u2019s rather difficult to accept concept, it\u2019s still believable. After three men hang themselves in an Parisian apartment, a doctor, trying to make a name for himself decides to stay there. At first nothing happens, but he becomes infatuated with a woman across the street who begins to have a psychic control over his will. The Vegetable Man - Luigi Ugolini - This was a good little tale, creepy in some of it's details. A botanist tells how he discovers a rare species of plant in the jungle which has seemingly infected him with plant cells which are replacing his own. In the Penal Colony - Franz Kafka - I've read this one several times, so didn't re-read it here. It's a masterpiece of bizarre Kafka strangeness and social commentary. A group of men gather around a brutal torture machine which is made to punish those who don't even know their crime, but causes a religious epiphany in their final moments.The White Wyrak - Stefan Grabinski - This was a really creepy story, scary imagery, very nice. One of the best very short stories in this collection. A group of chimneysweeps become concerned when some of their comrades go missing after cleaning a chimney in an old, closed brewery.The Night Wire - H. F. Arnold - This is a classic, a very weird story with an odd concept, but has a really good creepiness that I found quite effective. Two night wire operators start getting news of a small town where the people are being pursued and killed by a black fog which originated in a graveyard. The Dunwich Horror - H. P. Lovecraft - Oh come on, who hasn't read this one a couple times already? In a small village an old wizard has a son who grows at an amazing rate and delves deeply into the occult.+The Mainz Psalter - Jean Ray - This one totally blew me away and I'd like to read more by this author. This was a very imaginative, scary, and WEIRD story for sure. This reminds me of other such weird sea stories by Hodgson for example, but this one was surprisingly good for being lesser-known. A crew find themselves transported into another, menacing dimension after they agree to work for a strange schoolmaster. Sanatorium Under the Sign of the Hourglass - Bruno Schulz - VERY weird story, I see where Ligotti gets influence here. This stuff has great mood and atmosphere, incredibly dream-like and surreal. The end felt a bit random, but I liked this one a lot. A man moves into the sanatorium where his father has been put up, in a town where time has been turned back, and they are running on useless, \"worn out\" time, it's grey and dark, people sleep constantly. Far Below - Robert Barbour Johnson - This was a really good one, I thoroughly enjoyed it, it's pretty scary, although most of the horror is hinted at, and the implications of what little info we're given is what really makes the story so memorable. A man working in the New York subway system describes a cannibalistic primitive race of mankind who has burrowed there.Smoke Ghost - Fritz Leiber - This is another classic, a story cited by Ramsey Campbell as being a big inspiration to him. It's a very imaginative, unsettling story that brings the ghost story into a 20th century, urban setting. A man becomes haunted after seeing a dirty sack creep closer to him each day across a dingy series of rooftops. Soon the thing creeps out into the open, but for what purpose? It's a Good Life - Jerome Bixby - I really liked this one, it was definitely eerie, a sort of dystopian story, where there's an all-powerful figure and people cannot even think what they want. Simple concept, but horrible implications. One of the better sci-fi type stories in the collection. Everyone fears little Anthony who can read minds, and do whatever he wants to people with it.Axolotl - Julio Cortazar - Another extremely short, but very original story. A man becomes obsessed with watching axolotl's in an aquarium zoo, believing they are a higher evolved life than we imagine. +Don't Look Now - Daphne du Mauier - This is a masterpiece of suspense. It's got an extremely creepy feel to it, and was one of the biggest \"page-turners.\" Although I've seen the film version of this story, it didn't ruin it for me, this story has a very nice sense of paranoia and dread all of it's own. A couple vacationing in Venice after the death of their young daughter meet two old women who claim to have seen her spirit, and tell them to leave Venice to avert tragedy.The Hospice - Robert Aickman - I wouldn't consider this Aickman's best story, but it's a good example of the unsettling style of a very unappreciated writer. A man becomes stranded and takes refuge in a place called The Hospice where people act strange, there\u2019s no telephone and they don\u2019t seem to want him to leave. It Only Comes Out at Night - Dennis Etchison - This is one of the more \"standard horror stories\" in this collection I suppose. It's a very scary story, a mood of unease settles in quickly, and I could sorta tell where it was going, but I was hoping I was wrong! A man and wife traveling across a desert stop in at a very strange rest area.The Psychologist Who Wouldn\u2019t Do Terrible Things to Rats - James Tiptree - This was a good story, the first half didn't do a lot for me, but the second half was just excellent, and it's got a great theme overall. The horror here comes from what the man discovers, but also from the efficient, clockwork modern world and it's willingness to be brutal to animals, and people. A man working in a lab tries to avoid doing painful experiments on his rats, but finds his reputation at risk. The Beak Doctor - Eric Basso - OK, warning, this was by far the most challenging piece in the book, and it will not be for all tastes. But I found it rewarding overall. This is a muted, avant-garde piece; moody, pure atmosphere. It requires patience but does create a real sense of disorientation. I was bored for some stretches, then some semblance of plot, or conversation would bring us out of the dream-like state of it to the surface for a time. Very different stuff. A doctor wanders through the foggy streets of a city which is plagued by a sleeping sickness. Few people are still awake, and those who are attempt to continue with their lives. Sandkings - George R.R. Martin - This is a masterpiece of sci-fi with some creepy crawly horror, interesting beginning to end and well-written, just a good, fun story. A man acquires some insect-like creatures called Sandkings which build small castles inside a terrarium and feed an ugly \"maw\" which lives below the sand. But soon the things get out, start to grow bigger and have an insatiable hunger. +Window - Bob Leman - Wow, this is perhaps the story that scared me the most here, it's one of the most frightening and surprising stories I've read in a while. It starts out feeling predictable, but then it just takes a totally horrifying turn I didn't see coming at all. Very impressive. A scientist working with telekinesis is swallowed up during his experiments and a Victorian mansion with a family inside is left behind in place of his laboratory. A group of men try to understand this window into another world.The Brood - Ramsey Campbell - I've read this one twice before, so I didn't re-read it here. But OH MY GOD, this is a creepy, crawly, SCARY story. It\u2019s powerful, atmospheric, and this is definitely the story I would have chosen by Campbell. A man notes a crazy, sinister old woman who wanders the street in front of his apartment and seems to be collecting animals and taking them into her dilapidated old house across the street. +The Autopsy - Michael Shea - This is a science fiction-horror masterpiece, very powerful, smart, well-told and as gory as anything I've ever read. I really loved the set up here, lots of weird elements that I had no idea how they would come together, but in the end they did and far better than I would have predicted. After a man enters a mine with a bomb, killing several men, the mortician performing the autopsy discovers he was under the influence of an alien force.The Little Dirty Girl - Joanna Russ - This was an excellent story, and very much in the strange/weird Aickman variety. The end can be interpreted in a couple ways, I took it down a more disturbing path. A woman encounters a dirty little girl who she starts to feed and take care of, and becomes conscious that the girl must be a ghost, but a very material one. The Function of Dream Sleep - Harlan Ellison - I almost didn't include this in my selection of the BEST here, but this is a very emotional story, actually quite deeply touching for being also quite horrific at times. A man who has experienced the death of many close friends feels this is tied with a vision he has of waking up to find a huge mouth in his side. The Boy in the Tree - Elizabeth Hand - Good story, but it took me some time to figure out what the heck was going on, we don't get a really full picture until at least half through. In a research lab where wires are hooked up to people's heads who have few emotions, they are able to erase or take on other people's traumatic memories. But one of these memories has a supernatural power which is too much even for the rather numb narrator. Family - Joyce Carol Oates - This was a brutal, hard, amoral, dystopian story. Perhaps a commentary on the transitory nature of the American family today? A commentary on urbanization and how we have become unmoored from the past. Perhaps just a commentary on how nasty humans are generally -- or are they just trying to survive in a horrible reality? A family tries to survive as the outside world disintegrates, they get a new father, new siblings, and forget the old ones even existed. The Dark - Karen Joy Fowler - This is another great story, eerie, unsettling and paranoid. I liked how the end was left a bit open-ended although we know everything, there's enough mystery to still wonder about. After a boy goes missing in the woods, an epidemic specialist suspects there's a connection between his disappearance and the sudden appearance of plague in the area. +The Country Doctor - Steven Utley - It's always nice to find a story that surprises me, and this one really went off in a direction I wasn't expecting at all. I thought about this one for days. The characterization and storytelling generally are very involving. An old graveyard being excavated in a town about to be underwater from the building of a dam uncovers a very weird, creepy history. +The Snow Pavilion - Angela Carter - This was one of my absolute favorites here, I'm prepared to say this is a full-on masterpiece of atmospheric weird fiction. There's such a delicious sense of dread here and mounting suspense. It feels very much influenced by Aickman. A playboy philanderer get stranded in a strange, snowbound mansion full of dolls, and weird, unseen inhabitants. Yellow and Red - Tanith Lee - The editors think it's like M. R. James' \"Casting the Runes\" -- I think it's FAR closer to his story \"The Mezzotint.\" I don't think this is among the VERY best in this collection, but I really love this type of story, excellent atmosphere, setting. A man inherits an old gloomy house from his uncle which has caused those who lived there to waste away -- after spilling a drink on some old photographs he discovers why. The Specialists Hat - Kelly Link - Another one I hesitated to include here because this is a very strange story with weird elements I'm not sure came together, but I still really enjoyed the tone and atmosphere/setting, definitely has a good Gothic feel. Two twins living in a mansion with a dark past with their father get a babysitter who is, oddly enough, very well-acquainted with the house.The God of Dark Laughter - Michael Chabon - Another one I hesitated to include here, would have liked a bit more punch at the end. It's still a great story, nice sense of place here, creepy details. Not sure if the influence is Lovecraft, Ligotti or both. The DA of a small town discovers that a clown horrible murdered in the woods may have been murdered by a mysterious cult. Details - China Mi\u00e9ville - This was great, very creative and original concept which wouldn't work under the right conditions, but here it has a definite effectiveness. A boy is sent by his mother to see a Mrs Miller who he talks to through a door. She has opened a sort of window of perception, and is seeing patterns of horrors in the things of everyday life. The Cage - Jeff VanderMeer - This one almost gets a \"+\" I really liked it; wonderful idea, great setting. But most of all I loved the rainy, moldy mood of it. After mankind is besieged by a fungus-apocalypse, an antique dealer takes a risk in acquiring a strange old cage from a house recently taken over by the fungus. The Brotherhood of Mutilation - Brian Evenson - I like everything I've read by Evenson so far, this is no exception. It's funny, pulpy and told in a purely matter-of-fact way which makes it even more bizarre and Kafka-esque in it's absurd bureaucratic craziness. A man who had his hand cut off, and cauterized the wound himself is brought to a compound where a cult of men celebrate the removal of body parts, and where he is told to investigate a murder.Flat Diane - Daniel Abraham - This was an incredibly well-written, touching, page-turning story. Very original idea that comes across convincingly too. A single father traces around his daughter and sends the outline to relatives they can't afford to visit. What happens to the drawing seems to have an influence on the girl -- then the drawing falls into some very sinister hands.The Forest - Laird Barron - I think Barron has written some better work since this book was published, but this is certainly is a good one, and quite original. It has the usual hard edge of a Barron story while feeling a bit more fatalistic perhaps. An actor takes some time off to see an old friend, a hermit scientist who is trying to establish contact with a consciousness, not above the earth, but within it. The Portal - J. Robert Lennon - I really liked this one, very short but incredibly well told. It actually made me laugh, but it's got some creepy parts as well and I thought about it for days afterward. I like the rather mundane tone in which such things are explained in. I also think it's got a subtle moral about the disillusionment which can happen when one has everything they want. A father tells how, after buying an old house, the family discovers a portal in the backyard which sends them to increasingly disturbing places."}, {"userName": "Jon Hewelt", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35089031-jon-hewelt", "userReview": "Finished!After months of reading, I've finally finished this behemoth of a book! Which is not to suggest that it was a slog of read, nor that your experience with it should take so long. The Weird is an anthology, a collection of \"weird\" stories from past to present. A compendium, one that a reader can pick up, turn to a random page, and sit with for an hour or two.I, however, wanted to read the whole thing, front to back, in order, because I consider myself a fan of the \"weird\". From a young age I loved stories with supernatural elements, quirky characters and environs, unorthodox and nonlinear methods of storytelling. I loved stories that questioned reality, expanded the boundaries of our understanding of the known universe. But I never considered my knowledge of the \"weird\" to extend beneath the surface. I've read such well-knowns as Poe and Lovecraft and Kafka and King and Butler and Du Maurier and Bradbury and others, but I never felt like I adequately took the time to sit down and immerse myself in the \"weird\", get to know the obscurer authors and really familiarize myself with the genre.Hence The Weird. I found it (or, I suppose, it found me) and I knew, right from the start, that it would serve as an excellent primer to a genre I've loved for so long. And now, having tackled the massive thing, I can happily report that The Weird met and exceeded my expectations, hundredfold. What is \"weird\" fiction? I write it in quotes because, even after having read 1100 pages of it, I still can't describe it with certainty and if China Mievelle's \"after-weird\" gives any indication, neither can the authors and editors within this book. It's relatively safe to say that \"weird\" stories fall within the Horror genre, but not always. A lot of times \"weird\" stories contain supernatural elements. As is the case with Lovecraft, this supernatural presence takes the form of cosmic horror and explores madness and the limitations of the human mind. In other cases, as with Kafka, the \"weird\" comes from the terrifying and murderous banality of bureaucracy: evil-doing as a 9 to 5 job. \"Weird\" stories are labeled as such largely because of their content, but a \"weird\" stories can also be defined thusly by their style. Evocative prose, poetry can turn an ordinary narrative into an extraordinary one.Ultimately, I like what Mievelle has to say about \"weird\" stories: they are wyrms, wyrms that infect you and affect your perception of everything else you read. And that is true, at least for me. I like reading other genres, but in the past I've read such masterful accounts of the \"weird\" that I hold these other genres to a higher standard, of form at least if not of content. A story doesn't need tentacles to be good, but it could stand a few wriggling appendages if its writing is lacking.I consider The Weird an excellent collection of \"weird\" stories because it has such a wide variety of \"weird\" flavors, some you'll like and others that you won't. Me? I gravitate towards more colorful \"weird\" stories, like the works of Gahan Wilson and Clive Barker. Others might prefer something more classical, more austere. The point, ultimately, is that there ain't a stinker in the bunch. Editors Jeff (also contributor) and Ann VanderMeer prove an extensive knowledge of the \"weird\" story in their selection process, choosing not only all different kinds of \"weird\" but choosing authors from all around the world. This is an incredibly multicultural collection, and one of the best parts of reading The Weird is getting to see how difference countries manifest the \"weird\" in different ways.The Weird is also organized chronologically, and pretty evenly spread out across the decades, so that one gets to see the development of the \"weird\" not only over different countries but also over different time periods. I liked the stuff from the 60s and 70s, in particular, but as I say, there ain't a bad \"weird\" banana in the bunch. Whether you choose, like me, to delve deep and read The Weird from cover to cover, or casually pick it up for a particular author or time period, ye shan't be disappointed. The Weird is massive, mostly all-encompassing, and endlessly enjoyable. I plan on going back, at some point, and making a list of all the authors I enjoyed the most, just to dig even deeper. I must confess, The Weird has infected me.

Let's see how it goes.I'm reading The Willows by Blackwood right now and it is really good.\"The solitude of that Danube camping-place, can I ever forget it? The feeling of being utterly alone on an empty planet! My thoughts ran incessantly upon cities and the haunts of men. I would have given my soul, as the saying is, for the 'feel' of those Bavarian villages we had passed through by the score; for the normal, human commonplaces; peasants drinking beer, tables beneath the trees, hot sunshine, and a ruined castle on the rocks behind the red-roofed church.\"\"Neither of us moved to replenish the stock, and the darkness consequently came up very close to our faces.\"\"..on the frontier of another world, an alien world, a world tenanted by willows only and the souls of willows.\"The Dissection, by Georg Heym, contained this:\"And while the thumping of hammers resounded on his skull, a dream, a remnant of love awoke in him, like a torch shining in his personal night.Outside the tall window stretched a wide sky filled with small white clouds that swam like small white gods in the light of that silent afternoon. And swallows darted high across the blue, feathers quivering in the warm sun of July.\"\"The decay pulled apart the mouth of the dead man. He seemed to smile. He dreamed of beatific stars, of a fragrant summer evening. His rotting lips trembled as though under a brief kiss.'How I love you. I have loved you so much. Should I say how I love you? As you strolled across poppy fields, a flower of flames yourself, you swallowed the entire evening. And the dress that billowed around your ankles was a wave of fire in the setting sun. But you bowed your head in the light, hair still burning, inflamed by my kisses.'So you went down there, turning to look back at me as you walked away. And the lantern swayed in your hand like the glow of a rose lasting in the twilight long after you were gone.'I\u2019ll see you again tomorrow. Here, under the window of the chapel, here, where the light of the candles falls about you, making your hair a golden forest, and daffodils nestle around your ankles, tenderly, like tender kisses.'I will see you again every evening in the hour of dusk. We will never part. How I love you! Should I tell you how I love you?'And the dead man quivered in happiness on his white death table, while the iron chisels in the hands of the doctors broke open the bones of his temple.\" \"Genius Loci,\" Clark Ashton Smith\"Of the nightmarish days that followed, I shall offer only a summary. It would be impossible to convey the eventless, fantasmal horror in which we dwelt and moved.\"\"The Autopsy\" by Michael Shea\"The doctor proceeded to the internal exam with a vague eagerness for Willet's fragmentation, for the disarticulation of that sadness in his natural form.\"\"Tears of fury filled the doctor's eyes. Clenching his one fist at the starry engine of creation that he could not see, he ground his teeth and whispered in the hot breath of strangled weeping:'Take t back, this dirty little shred of life! I throw it off gladly like the filth it is.'\"\"Tainaron: Mail from Another City,\" by Leena Krohn\"...hope quivers and the spirit of spring gusts around them as freshly as if nothing had ever yet been lost forever.\"\"Farewell once more; my head is heavy and I believe a thunderstorm is brewing. I ponder the reasons why you do not reply, and there are many. Are you dead? Have you moved? The city where you lived has perhaps disappeared from the face of the earth? And can I trust the mail of Tainaron; who knows on what back-garden compost-heap my letters are languishing? Or you stand on your doormat turning my letter over in your hands; turning it over and then putting it aside unopened, on top of the pile of newspapers and advertisements that grows and grows in the dusty corner.\"\"And then there are the nights, they are definitely too big. They have grown larger and larger since the princess left, and the princess left thirty years ago, in her prime. You will not believe how small they were when she was still here. This small!\"\"'Yes, stay here forever,' Longhorn said, but his voice darkened to such a depth that I forgot the Mimic and turned toward him in astonishment.\"\"It was evening once, and I was a child, out in the street.\"\"I asked what had been most difficult in his life, and the bag answered: 'The fact that everything recurs and must always return and that the same questions are asked again and again.'\"June 15, 2014--It only took me a year to get through this. But here I am, on the other side! This was overall a great collection, and introduced me to new authors and a genre I really ended up liking--the weird. As China Mieville ends the Afterweird: \"These texts, dead and/or not, burrow, and we cannot predict everything they will infect or eat their path through. But certainly your brain, and they will eat the books you read from today on, too. That is how the weird recruits. This is a worm farm. These stories are worms.\""}], "description": "From Lovecraft to Borges to Gaiman, a century of intrepid literary experimentation has created a corpus of dark and strange stories that transcend all known genre boundaries.
