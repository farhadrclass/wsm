A CHRISTMAS PROMISE by Sarah M. Eden 5 stars I always look forward to Eden's works in these anthologies with their charming stories of love and A Christmas Promise is no different. With a lost Sean Kirkpatrick whose on his way to his new employment and finding love unexpectedly in Maeve Butler who helps him find his way in more then one way. This was just another excellent example of Eden's works with beautiful characters all around and a few surprises along the way. \"..But the trait that most defines us is the heart of a poet, and it shows most in quiet moments like that one, when a hopeful sort of love is born.\" TWELVE MONTHS by Heather B. Moore 3. 5 stars The power of healing that loves brings to a young woman Cora, when her cheating husband suddenly dies leaving his best friend Lucien Baxter to help pick of the pieces. Didn't care for the husband cheating to be so pronounce but it was sweet to see the Cora and Lucien falling in love slowly.A FEZZIWIG CHRISTMAS by Lu Ann Staheli 4 stars  It was wonderful to see a well known Christmas character like Ebenezer Scrooge as his younger self and helping his best friend win the hand of his lady love. A TASTE OF HOME by Annette Lyon 4.5 stars Claire Jennings is on her way home along with her old childhood nemesis William Rhodes. But when news reaches her that she can't go home, she sees a different Will who tries to make her Christmas a memorable one to help with her homesickness and loneliness.  Another sweet story with beautiful descriptions of a bygone Utah. MY MODERN GIRL by Becca Wilhite 3 stars Margie is making her way in the world and living her dream of living in the city.

Especially because these novellas were written by some of my favorite authors. But I found this anthology to be slower than most and some of the stories were almost too slow for me. All were well-written so I'm sure that was just a personal preference...Fairy Christmas by Lucinda Brant - 3.5 stars; 1767 EnglandMiss Katherine Aldershot, aka Kitty, is all alone in the world, but is fortunate to have been taken in by the wealthy and powerful Earl of Salt Hendon and his wife. She has had her eye on Mr. Tom Allenby, the brother of the Earl's wife, and thinks he is interested in her but he is a successful businessman and she is pretty sure that he might be too good for her. Her new assignment is to entertain the Russian noble who has come to visit the Earl, Prince Timur-Alexei Nikolai Mordvinov, who is old enough to be her grandfather. The Prince helps Kitty see that there is a lot she isn't seeing.A Christmas Promise by Sarah Eden - 3 stars; Late 1820'sSean Kirkpatrick is handsome, quick-witted, and not easily offended. He is also lost on his way to Kilkenny. Maeve Butler is lovely, quick-witted, and clever. And she happens to know the way to Kilkenny. Getting lost helped Sean find the greatest treasure.Twelve Months by Heather Moore - 4 stars; 1907 EnglandLucien Baxter has a law practice in London, but when his best friend Will Griffiths summons him to his deathbed, he goes. His best friend also has a last request: that Lucien marry his lovely widow. Cora is beautiful, intelligent, and devoted - and unlucky in love. Her first fiance was killed in battle and her husband is now dying when they have been married for less than a year. Can she open her heart again to the faithful and loyal Lucien?A Fezziwig Christmas by LuAnn Brobst Staheli - 3.5 stars; 1790 LondonDick Wilkins is the best friend and co-worker of Ebenezer Scrooge (when he is young and before he is so Scrooge-y), and they both work for Mr. Fezziwig who has some beautiful daughters. Ebenezer is almost engaged to the oldest daughter and Dick is hoping for some Christmas magic to help him win the heart of the second daughter, Pricilla.A Taste of Home by Annette Lyon - 4.5 stars; 1913 UtahClaire Jennings has been working in San Francisco, and can hardly wait to get home to her family in Utah for Christmas. Her excitement is the only thing making the travel with Will Rhodes tolerable. Will has been her tormenter since she was a young girl. But when they get to Utah she finds out that her family is quarantined and she won't be able to see them after all. The only reason Will came home for Christmas was for the opportunity to be with Claire. So he stays in town with her for Christmas and works hard to show her that he is no longer that young boy who teased her, and that he is capable of making her very happy!My Modern Girl by Becca Wilhite - 4.5 stars; 1924 New YorkMargie is a modern girl on her way to New York. She has a job on the sales floor of Macy's and can hardly wait to get there! Modern girls don't go weak-kneed when kissing boys they've known their whole lives. Especially when that boy is a coal worker. And so she begs Henry not to proclaim his undying love, and tells him he can write. His parting words to her are \"I'll make you proud.\" In New York Margie learns a lot about herself and others. I loved Henry! I loved how he never tried to change Margie and embraced every part of her - even the \"modern girl\" part of her! Instead of trying to change her, he worked to change things about himself.Content: Very clean, no swearingSource: Review Copy (opinions are 100% my own)"}, {"userName": "Katie W", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/988087-katie-w", "userReview": "FAIRY CHRISTMAS I thought this was a sweet story that took place in the late 1700s. Kitty is an orphan and has every reason to be bitter about life, yet she isn't. She is so sweet and tries to ease the lives of those around her to make up for their generosity towards her. She would love for nothing more than to win Tom's affections, yet wouldn't dream of ruining his reputation and career, which goes to show how selfless she is. Tom is such a shy and bashful man, yet he is very kind. I loved the foreign prince--he was a fun character to have around. Clean!A CHRISTMAS PROMISE Maeve is such a fiery girl and before he knows it, Sean is whooped! Sean needs this new job, but gets stuck and lost and has to rely on Maeve to help him out. I loved that banter that ensues. Fun characters with a spin on a story that isn't your typical holiday romance. Clean!TWELVE MONTHS Don't we all have a friend who is the more dramatic and dominate of the friendship? That's exactly the case in Lucien and Will's unlikely friendship. They are so opposite and for some reason, Lucien feels a strong pull of loyalty toward covering for Will's casual mistakes. When Will dies suddenly, Lucien promises to care for his new wife and unborn baby. Cora has been devastated by death not once, but twice, and doesn't want to marry again, yet Lucien has a way of worming his way into her heart. Lucien is such a kind and patient man and Cora is as sweet as can be. I love the piano battles. Clean!A FEZZIWIG CHRISTMAS I don't believe I've ever read a story about the life of Ebenezer Scrooge before he became...scroogy. This was a fun story with his friend, Dick, in the forefront, trying to win the attention of the lovely sister of Ebenezer's girl. It's not as easy as he thinks, since Pricilla is being pursued by many and he's not as outgoing as he'd like to be. I love how meek and down-to-earth Dick is. Clean!A TASTE OF HOME I love a romance about two people who grew up together, but never have a mutual attraction until later. Maybe that's because my husband and I grew up together, yet didn't have a relationship until college. :) William was the kind of boy who tormented Claire, but how else is he supposed to capture her attention? Now that they both work in CA, William is escorting Claire home for the holidays. And he's nothing like the boy she once knew. I love how sweet and thoughtful William is. He truly has Claire in mind, as he strives to make this a Christmas to remember. Claire is as sweet and pretty as ever and isn't one to hold a grudge. Very sweet story! Clean!MY MODERN GIRL I haven't read many stories that take place in the 1920s, but this one did and was a lot of fun! It was fun to picture what life was like in NYC during this time. I loved the imagery, descriptions, and storyline. I also loved the way Margie set out to become modern, but learned some important lessons along the way. Henry is a rock-solid man who works hard and doesn't care for what society thinks, yet he doesn't take Margie's feelings lightly. He's very supportive. This one was a great story to end the book. Clean!Each story was tender and really helped the spirit of the holidays come to life. This whole collection moved a little slower than some of the others, but the pace was perfect for a nice, holiday read. Read it all in one sitting or savor a story a day. Either way, it'll be a fun adventure. *I received a copy in exchange for an honest review*"}, {"userName": "Aimee (Getting Your Read On)", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1934633-aimee-getting-your-read-on", "userReview": "I have been reading a lot of books this week that are set around Christmas.

Each author has her own style and I enjoyed each one. All the characters were likeable and they really helped me get in the Christmas spirit. The language was clean and the romances were sweet, not steamy.A Fairy Christmas by Lucinda Brant is set in England in 1767. After becoming orphaned, Kitty is goes to live with a distant relative. She falls in love with a young man but after catching a brief glimpse of a letter from her best friend on the back of a young boys drawing, she believes everyone in the household thinks she would be bad for him. The story kept my interest and I loved the banter between some of the characters.A Christmas Promise by Sarah M. Eden is a story told by an old man in the late 1820\u2019s and is set in Ireland. Ms. Eden painted such a picture I almost felt as if I were in Ireland. Sean Kirkpatrick is a stable hand with a new job a far distance from his home in County Mayo. In trying to follow a map to his new job, he feels he is hopelessly lost and turns in at a lane with a large hay barn at the end. His horse drawn cart becomes mired in the mud and Sean must ask for help getting \u201cunstuck\u201d and directions to Kilkenny Castle. Mauve Butler gets her brothers to help Sean but once the cart is freed, they insist he must stay the night. When Mauve leads Sean to Kilkenny Castle the next day and it is only a 15 minute walk away, sparks fly and the rest is a delightful story.Twelve Months by Heather B Moore is set in the early 1900s and is the story of Lucien. He gets a call that his best friend, Will is dying. He takes a train to his friend who dies shortly after he arrives. Wills\u2019 death bed wish is that Lucien will marry Cora, Will\u2019s pregnant wife, and take good care of her. Lucien stands by Cora during the funeral and as a solicitor, helps clear up all Wills\u2019 financial matters. When he asks Cora to marry him, she refuses. Will was unfaithful to her and she doesn\u2019t want to burden Lucien with a child not his own. A sweet ending makes this a good story.A Fezziwig Christmas by Lu Ann Brobst Staheli takes a spin back to the early days of Ebenezer Scrooge as a young courting man. His best friend, Dick Wilkins and fellow apprentice falls for the middle daughter of their boss. A Christmas work party is the setting for much of the book during which Dick tries to win the girl.A Taste of Home by Annette Lyons is a sweet tale. Claire Jennings travels by train from California to Utah, going home for Christmas. Her childhood tormentor, Will Rhodes accompanies her at her father\u2019s request as her protector. When they arrive at the train station in Salt Lake and Claire\u2019s father is not there, Will investigates and finds out that Claire\u2019s little brother has the measles and the family is in quarantine. Since Claire is unable to go home, Will agrees to stay in Salt Lake City and tries to make it so Claire is not so homesick.My Modern Girl by Becca Wilhite takes place in the early 1900\u2019s. Margie travels to NYC to work at Macy\u2019s leaving the \u201cboring\u201d life and her lifelong friend Henry in Western Pennsylvania. She thinks the big city and being a modern girl will make all her dreams come true. As Christmas approaches, she grows up and realizes that the \u201ccity\u201d isn\u2019t as glamorous as she thought and she misses her family and especially Henry."}, {"userName": "Tressa (Wishful Endings)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2253384-tressa-wishful-endings", "userReview": "I love reading short romantic Christmas stories. They're sweet. They're fun. I can finish one in a single sitting and at the end they leave a smile on my face. These stories are no different.FAIRY CHRISTMAS by Lucinda Brant - 4 starsThis was a sweet story that involved two romances. I found both to be sweet. I also liked the contrast between a younger and older couple falling in love and how the differences in their behavior. No one is ever too old to fall in love.A CHRISTMAS PROMISE by Sarah M. Eden - 4 starsThis story was pretty much love at first sight. What I liked is that it was sincere and humorous. I also loved the feel of family with Maeve and her brothers. Another good story.TWELVE MONTHS by Heather B. Moore - 3.5 starsThis was an interesting story. Basically the couple who should have probably been married in the first place are thrown together when her husband and his best friend passes away from an illness. There were some sweet moments.A FEZZIWIG CHRISTMAS by Lu Ann Staheli - 3 starsThis felt like a retelling of Scrooge/A Christmas Carol, but about a younger and much happier Ebenezer and his co-worker and friend Dick. There were two romances in this one as well. It was a cute story, but not my favorite of the set.A TASTE OF HOME by Annette Lyon - 5 starsThis was my favorite story from the set. I pretty much loved it from the first page to the last. I really liked the the two main characters had known each other their whole lives. Their history felt a little like Anne and Gilbert from Anne of Green Gables, especially with Will teasing Claire when they were younger because he had a crush on her and was trying to garner her attention. When they are thrown together again years later, that adoration is still there and Claire begins to notice Will in a different way. It was a sweet and heartfelt story, showing that Christmas can be found in more than just traditions, or places, or things, but in the people we love.MY MODERN GIRL by Becca Wilhite - 4 starsThis story cracked me up. Margie was so focused on becoming part of her peers in the new flapper era that she lost sight of who she was and what she had in Henry. Oh, dear Henry. That guy was too good for her, but she made up for it in the end. I especially loved the symbolism of the glass hearts. Reminded me a little of the movie Sweet Home Alabama.Overall Silver Bells was a sweet set of romantic Christmas stories. They each gave me a sweet happily-ever-after ending and reminded me that Christmas can be full of so much love.Content: There was some innuendo and references to infidelity, but I would consider this clean.Source: From a review site, which did not affect my review in any way."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15729211-linda", "userReview": "A Timeless Romance Anthology: Silver Bells,These short stories are a quick and easy read.

Her thoughts where real but with a surprise twist. Loved her aunt and the secret she held. Now I know what a Yule Log is!!A Christmas Promise Late 1820's by Sarah Eden; \u201cOld Tom\u201d tells a love story set in Ireland. Sean gets lost on a cold and rainy night and that\u2019s where the unknown romance begins. Maeve\u2019s brothers are the typical brother\u2019s with their teasing.

As the story unfolds after Will\u2019s death, Lucien learns of his friend\u2019s marriage through the eyes of Cora his widow. Will Lucien be able to carry out his friend\u2019s last wish?A Fezziwig Christmas 1790 by LuAnn Brobst Staheli; Dick is falling for the beautiful young lady Pricilla Fezziwig his bosses daughter.

Will tries to make it a Merry Christmas for her and show her the sights of Salt Lake.My Modern Girl 1924 by Becca Wilhite; I really loved this story. I\u2019ve always wondered what the 20\u2019s were like. I found this story humorous because of how \u201cmodern\u201d she wanted to be.

I loved it! I was charmed by the first novella, Lucinda Brant\u2019s FAIRY CHRISTMAS. I enjoyed the warmth of the relationship between Kitty and Tom and also the sweet surprise of love between the elderly couple. I really enjoyed the second novella, A CHRISTMAS PROMISE by Sarah M. Eden. A fun little story about an Irish lass and the man that stumbled onto her property and into her heart. The next novella was Heather B. Moore\u2019s enchanting novella, TWELVE MONTHS. I loved the loyalty and dedication with which Lucien watches over his best friend's widow and unborn child and the sweet story of how they fall in love. I wasn't as enamored with the fourth novella, Lu Ann Staheli\u2019s A FEZZIWIG CHRISTMAS. It wasn't a bad story or writing, I just wasn't interested in a story about a young Ebeneezer Scrooge and his friend Dick. The fifth novella was a sweet story. A TASTE OF HOME by Annette Lyon. Claire Jennings finds out there's more to her childhood nemesis, William Rhodes, than she thought. As they spend the holiday together he proves he's now a grown man willing to do anything to prove his love. The sixth novella was sweet but also not a favorite. MY MODERN GIRL by Becca Wilhite.

I like that I don't have to gamble or do exhaustive combing through reviews hoping someone adds sensuality level information in their review. So I have enjoyed the many Triple Treat Romances box set series that have come out, each with three full length novels of bestselling clean secular romance authors, and the Timeless Romance Anthology collection series sets, each with six clean romance novellas, which the work here being reviewed is one of themThis novella collection is all new Christmas historical fiction set from the 1700's to the 1920's.Fairy Christmas by Lucinda Brant, England 1767:This was a novella that brought back the characters of the author's Salt Hedon Series which are Georgian era historical romance suspense. Through the vehicle of a guest of the Earl of Salt Hedon, Russian Prince Timur-Alexei Nikolai Mordvinov whom has been commanded by Russian Empress Catherine the Great to learn and record all he can about the tradition, culture, fashion, society, and goods of England, we learn a lot about Georgian era Christmas traditions. I finally know what the big deal and all the seriousness about the Yule log is about. This novella had a romantic major plot and a romantic sub-plot that I enjoyed being led astray about both conclusions, even though you knew there was going to be a HEA and they both would be resolved fast, because it was a novella.A Christmas Promise by Sarah M. Eden, Ireland late 1820's:I was looking forward to reading this as I am a big Sarah Eden fan. I have only read her earlier written works that became no longer available till they were republished under new titles. The ones where the heroes or heroines have realistic physical, psychological, or sociological adversities and sometimes a tragic back story as barriers to their romantic HEA. I had never read any of her \u201clight and humorous\u201d historical fiction that most Sarah Eden fans have read, so I didn\u2019t know what to expect? Turns out I like light and humorous Sarah too. This was so refreshing as this was an Irish love tale narrated by an traditional story teller named \u201cOld Tom\u201d. Ireland and the Irish people seem to be severely neglected in popular historical romance and the format of an Irish tale is perfect for a short story or novella. I am a serious British Georgian-Regency era fiction aficionado, but I also additionally found this tale refreshing, because Sean and Maeve\u2019s courtship was morally proper, but was NOT bound by stifling rules of British courtship. So there was laughter, fun, saying what you really mean , and choosing for love. The characterizations were great. I loved the hero and heroine!Twelve Months by Heather B. Moore,England 1907:Mercy! The romance in this was splendiferous heart squeezing breathlessly BEAUTIFUL!!! Lucien is such a magnifique extraordinary romantic hero. His courtship of Cora just makes me sigh and do soft girly squeals of delight in remembrance of. One example of many, it has been over a week since I have read this, and his musical compositions he played on the pianoforte to Cora are still playing in my head as real music, instead of just words on a page describing stories and emotions he composed into music and played for her. Yes *sigh*! A Fezzwig Christmas by Lu Ann Brobst Staheli, England 1790: I always enjoyed the evening of Mr. Fezzwig\u2019s Christmas party in the \u201cChristmas Carol\u201d by Charles Dickens, which the Ghost of Christmas Past had Ebenezer Scrooge revisit. I always wished as a reader we could have stayed longer in that scene with the younger Ebenezer in love with the daughter of his mentor. Yet I know the story between the two of them could not revisited with them as the main characters, when it would have the reader foreknowledge hanging over it that Ebenezer, like a Greek hero fighting a prophecy from the Oracle of Delphi actually makes the prophecy come true, and ends up losing Belle anyways, by shattering her heart to pieces by his change into the miserly beast. I forgot about his friend Dick the other accounting apprentice and through his courtship of Belle\u2019s sister Cillia we get an expanded revisit. Though Belle and Ebenezer were only side characters in this romance novella I enjoyed how romantically passionate and intelligent they were. This novella was wonderfully written over all, and I was pleased to revisit this expansion of the classic and look forward to reading more from this award winning author.A Taste of Home by Annette Lyon, U.S.A. 1913: This was another really swoony sigh worthy romantic one like  Twelve Months. Will the heroine had nightmarishly tormented the heroine Claire with pranks all through their childhood together. Will has always loved with all his heart \u201cThe Claire Jennings\u201d and negative attention to him was better than no attention. For Claire, Christmas equals family and family traditions. So when to Claire\u2019s horror after traveling all the way back home to Utah from California (with Will as an escort), she finds news that her entire family is under quarantine and she can\u2019t spend Christmas with them, she is in distressed to ceaseless tears of sadness. Will convinces her to stay in the city for the holidays and proceeds to be an example of a man who will selfishly do anything even to great sacrifice to make the woman he loves happy. This one put me into the Christmas Spirit the most and I blame for giving me a massive craving for toffee.My Modern Girl by Becca Wilhite, U.S.A. 1924:This is the same country only a decade later from the prior novella, but what a difference a decade makes. It is now the Roaring 20\u2019s, the Jazz Age, and the \u201cDawning of the Modern Woman\u201d (Era of the Flapper Girl). There is a post WWII youth social independence movement from the prior set of societal values and sexual conduct. The heroine Margie in my mind reminded me in so many ways of the character Jenna Rink in the movie 13 Going on 30. They both want to emulate the fun, flirty, and fashionable modern lifestyles of their favorite magazine. For Margie it is Harper\u2019s magazine, as it was Poise magazine for Jenna. Both young women leave behind faithful honorable childhood male friends who are in love with them, for a worldly profligate lifestyle that they feel these men embarrassingly don\u2019t fit in to. After the initial \u201cpride\u201d of achieving the lifestyle it is \u201cmixed with shame\u201d for their actions and how they have degenerated. They also both realize that sometimes getting what you want is not always what it is cracked up to be. They also both realize that sometimes what you leave behind is what you really want.Sensuality content: Kisses only on all. Modern Girl has a flapper girl \"petting party\" which is not what you think. When I researched it they were \"snogging\", \"cuddling\", \"hugging\", and \"kissing\" only parties. Modern Girl also has extremely mild double entendre flirting constantly about snogging (again hugging and kissing).Source: Review copy for my 100% honest opinion."}, {"userName": "Laura ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5042612-laura", "userReview": "This is a compilation of 6 short stories all set around the Christmas season. A couple of these stories are by my favorite authors, while the rest are new to me. I really enjoyed reading them. It made me wish for snow-almost! Two are regency period, 2 are set in the 1800's & 2 are early 1900's. If you are looking for fun & easy Christmas mood setting reads I highly recommend this anthology. The language is clean & the romance is sweet!Lucinda Brant\u2019s novella, FAIRY CHRISTMAS, is about Kitty. She is orphaned and forced to live on others\u2019 charity. Offered a home under the generous roof of her relatives, Kitty wants for nothing--except the love of a good man. The story revolves around her misunderstanding of a letter she starts to read. The supporting characters are wonderful. The interaction between an old aunt and a delightfully eccentric prince, it was a fun read! Of course it ends in a wonderful little happily ever after for both Kitty and her aunt!Sarah Eden\u2019s novella A CHRISTMAS PROMISE, is a story told by Old Tom that centers around Sean Kirkpatrick. He is trying to get to his new place of employment in order to start as the new stablehand. Unfortunately he winds up in a muddy field, stuck, lost, and running out of time. He\u2019s about to lose the job before he can get there! When Maeve Butler arrives on the scene, Sean isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019s intent on rescuing him or bent on torturing him with her fiery wit. I LOVED the banter between Sean and Maeve. I wasn't in love with the narration by Old Tom, but after a few pages was thoroughly engrossed in the story.In Heather B. Moore\u2019s TWELVE MONTHS, Lucien's best friend, Will, dies unexpectedly, leaving behind his new bride and unborn child the week before Christmas. Will\u2019s last request is that Lucien watches over Cora, not just as a benefactor, but as a husband. When Lucien does his duty and proposes to Cora, he\u2019s turned down flat. But over the course of the next few days, Lucien discovers that marrying Cora wouldn\u2019t be any sort of duty after all, but a matter of following his heart. I read this entire novella in one sitting. I enjoyed watching Cora's personality blossom as the story continued. Lu Ann Staheli\u2019s novella, A FEZZIWIG CHRISTMAS, is centered around Ebenezer Scrooge & his friend Dick Wilkins. As apprentices in the counting house together, they have been looking forward to the annual Fezziwig Christmas dance for weeks. Ebenezer is practically engaged to Annabelle Fezziwig, and Dick hopes to start courting her younger sister, Pricilla. Ebenezer advises Dick that he has to win Pricilla\u2019s heart, as well as her mother\u2019s favor. Losing his heart has suddenly become very complicated. This was probably my least favorite of the novellas. While it was a sweet little read, it just seemed more flat than the rest. (Maybe just because I love A Christmas Carol so much!)In A TASTE OF HOME, by Annette Lyon, Claire Jennings, is on her way to spend Christmas with her family. As she rides the train with William Rhodes, who grew up across the street, memories of Christmases past flood her mind. He may be twenty-one now, but she can\u2019t forget his torturous teasing from their school years. At the rail station, Claire discovers that her home is under quarantine because her little brother has measles. She's stuck in town, away from her family, on her favorite holiday. William stays behind with her, and as Christmas Day approaches and her homesickness deepens, she discovers that perhaps he has changed in more ways than one. I was surprised by how much I enjoyed this story. Historical fiction set in the early 1900's isn't normally my preferred reading. This story, however, was great. I loved the little flashbacks and history that Claire and Will shared. It read very much like Anne and Gilbert's childhood & relationship.Becca Wilhite\u2019s novella, MY MODERN GIRL, follows Margie, who lands her dream job as a clerk at Macy\u2019s department store in New York City. Leaving behind her family was almost as hard as leaving Henry. As the Christmas season approaches, Margie realizes that being a \u201cmodern girl\u201d might not be all she had dreamed of and Henry might have more to offer than she ever imagined. I was the most skeptical of this story. Margaret gave me the impression of a little girl trying to prove that she was all grown up & knew more than everybody else. She did grow through the story--a very big improvement! Henry was a great hero--everything she should have wanted before she left home!"}, {"userName": "Heidi", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3904308-heidi", "userReview": "FAIRY CHRISTMAS. I thoroughly enjoyed this story. Kitty and Allenby were sweet characters, but the part that surprised me the most was the other romance that took place in the story. I was focused on Kitty and her attempt to get Mr. Allenby to propose that I didn't realize that the other romance was happening although there are hints that point in that direction. This is the kind of short story that I enjoy, with enough conflict to create a plot, but the emphasis is on the characters.A CHRISTMAS PROMISE. The details in this story about Ireland and the Irish I found quite amusing. I found myself laughing out loud at several points in the story. I also loved Sean and Maeve as they met and fell in love. The part where Sean gets stuck in the mud and meets Maeve and her large Irish wolfhounds entertained me very much. But the ending I found especially pleasing as it showcases the strength of a solid relationship that goes beyond just being in love, but true trust and commitment.TWELVE MONTHS: Cory and Lucien both won me over immediately. Sweet Cory who lost both her fiance and now her husband, who also had to live with knowing her husband was unfaithful to her and is reluctant to believe in a good love again. Lucien, whose best friend was Cory's husband, is used to covering for Will but to marry his wife? He's uncertain at first until he starts to get to know her and realizes how great she is and how much he likes her. I especially enjoyed the musical parts where they played for each other.A FEZZIWIG CHRISTMAS. This is an interesting take on Ebenezer Scrooge story with the main character actually being his friend, Dick Wilkins. Cilla is an interesting character as well as she looks forward to receiving suitors. And Dick being already smitten was cute as he tried to figure out the best way to approach her. The dance where Dick first becomes Cilla's rescuer is sweet as she seeks to avoid someone she discovers to her dismay is boring as all get out. It was kind of sad reading about Ebenezer proposing to Belle knowing what would happen later, but all in all a sweet story.A TASTE OF HOME. The fun thing about this story was the way Claire started to see Will in a new way. After Will tormented her throughout her childhood she was reluctant to travel home to Utah with him, but it was better than traveling alone. When she discovers that she can't go home because her little brother has the measles she is devastated. Will decides this is his opportunity to show Claire how much he likes her by helping her face a lonely Christmas. I love the selfless gesture that Will makes to help a disappointed Claire enjoy Christmas.MY MODERN GIRL. I think this one was my favorite of the six stories. I fell for Henry almost immediately. His willingness to let Margie go since that's what she wanted won me over as did his determination to prove to her his worthiness. And then as Margie slowly realized that while she loved certain things about the city, there were things about home she missed, including Henry. But the way Henry came through for her at the end really made me sigh happily. This is what a short story romance should be.Overall a wonderful set of short stories that I thoroughly enjoyed."}, {"userName": "DiQu91", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21837935-diqu91", "userReview": "Christmas is a time of miracles and a time of love. And when Six amazing authors join together, it becomes the perfect treat for the readers. These authors bring their short and romantic historical stories in \u201cA Timeless Romance Anthology- Silver Bells\u201d.  A Fairy Christmas (Lucinda Brant): England,1767. This story was a little slow for me, but overall had a very sweet and happy effect. I liked how Kitty is a hopeful person and her love for Tom Allenby is very sweet. They are smart and don\u2019t rush things like many new-age couples and wait to understand each other first. A Christmas Promise (Sarah M. Eden): Late 1820\u2019s- This is one of my favorite story. I liked that Maeve, a sister of two annoying brothers, is an independent women with an air of authority and Sean and Maeve are perfect for each other, especially when they confess their love on Christmas. This story shows that how one mistake and a one wrong turn can completely change your life, especially when that change is good.  Twelve Months (Heather B. Moore): England, 1907-This was a beautiful story with the proof that miracles happen. After having bad luck twice in a love, Cora is not planning to fall in love again. But when her late husband\u2019s best-friend Lucien cares for her and (for her husband\u2019s last wish) proposes her, she was not expecting the love and a happy ending in her life. It\u2019s a charming story that starts with being friends/companions and ending with the marriage. A Fezziwig Christmas (LuAnn Brobst Staheli): London, 1790-For me, this book was a little frustrating. I liked the story but the heroine, Pricilla was a little slow to understand the love of Dick for her. I like how Dick even when being poor kept the hope that Pricilla will love him back until he got her and her parents\u2019 permission to court her. Finally the end was happy and perfect. A Taste of Home (Annette Lyon): 1913-This is the sweetest story of two childhood enemies becoming lovers when they get older. Due to some reasons, Claire and Will can\u2019t go home and decide to spend the Christmas together. The efforts of Will to make Claire happy are very cute and make you wish you had someone like him, who would care for you and your wishes and make the Christmas day special. My Modern Girl (Becca Wilhite): 1924-A beautiful story of a girl Margie, who is trying to fit in the modern city away from her family and friends, and her journey to the realization that she is in love with a man she left behind in her home town. The cute way they stay in touch with letters and how Henry is the perfect guy, she dreamt about. The sweet Christmas story including silver bulbs with heart shaped hooks. Over all, it is a perfect Christmas package, with the best writers and amazing and enchanting stories to have on the Christmas Eve."}, {"userName": "Kara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3157038-kara", "userReview": "I am normally not a fan of short stories because I don't feel satisfied. The story is either too short for me to feel any real connection to the characters or I love the story so much that I am sad it wasn't a full length book so I could get to know them even better. But this anthology had some pleasant surprises for me. Here is a breakdown of my thoughts for each story.FAIRY CHRISTMAS- This one I struggled with a little. It focused a lot on the older couple in the story. I was a little frustrated because I felt like we didn't get a very good look at Kitty's story, the heroine. 3 starsA CHRISTMAS PROMISE- I really liked this story. I love Sarah Eden and her writing style and this story didn't disappoint. Even though it was short, I felt like the story was developed enough that the blooming romance was believable. And I loved the bantering in this story. Sean and Maeve were great characters. Just loved them. 5 starsTWELVE MONTHS- This is one of those stories that left me wanting more. I could very much see this being a full length book. I loved the tenderness between Lucien and Cora. Cora was so strong and sweet. Such a sad start to her story. And I loved watching Lucien as he shifted his thinking from always cleaning up after his best friend to realizing that his friend was wrong. And I loved the ending of the story, with the letters. So sweet. I loved everything about this story and only wished it was longer. 5 starsA FEZZIWIG CHRISTMAS- I struggled with this story a lot. It took me the longest to get through because I just didn't care about the main character. Cilla seemed so immature to me. She went from wanting the attentions of two dozen men to suddenly realizing that what she really wanted was Dick. More like Dick was the only one who she could stand to be around and so that translated into a match made in heaven. Not a fan. 2.5 starsA TASTE OF HOME- I really liked this one. I loved that there was a backstory to Will and Claire's relationship. I thought that really made it believable and sweet. I love all that Will did for her to show Claire he'd changed from when they were kids. He was so thoughtful. I also liked that Claire was hesitant and needed a little proof that he was different. I used to live in Salt Lake and it was fun to be able to see in my mind where they were as they walked down the streets. Sweet story. 5 starsMy Modern Girl- This was an okay story, but I didn't love it. Margie seemed to be selfish. Henry worked so hard to be who he thought Margie wanted. I was just bugged that because Henry didn't fit the modern man image he was deemed not good enough. Even when he surprised her with a gift all she could look at was the dirty fingerprint under the tape. It was only when Henry fit her desire for him to be an artist that he was seen as enough. 3 stars"}, {"userName": "Lizz Martensen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8071214-lizz-martensen", "userReview": "This collection is fun and a great way to get into the Christmas spirit! As I've been listening to Christmas music for weeks already, this was the perfect book to continue my holiday mood :) I've ranked my favorite short stories as follows:1. A Taste of Home - I love Claire's excitement at going home and the detail that is spent on her Christmas memories. I love Will's hesitation that isn't fully explained at the beginning. They are both their own person and the story develops over a short period of time, but, unlike most romances, it is almost believable. This book could do with a stronger editing though, unless Will really did dip Claire's \"brains\" in white paint ... 2. A Christmas Promise - This book reminds me so much of the Christmas song, \"Christmas Day\" by Dido. However, unlike the song there is quite the happy ending in store for these characters. Starting out with a narrator was a little awkward, but it reminded me of \"The Princess Bride\" in a good way. Sean is a hardworking, sweet guy whose ego gets the better of him and luckily, Maeve was there to save him. 3. My Modern Girl - This one just made me laugh. How many times have we gone out of our way to have fancy French chocolates and when we got them, thought that Hershey's bars were even better? That is the moral of this story, sometimes what's right in front of you really is the best thing. I loved seeing Macy's and the Thanksgiving Day parade from an \"insider's\" perspective and this book felt a little like the movie, \"Sweet Home Alabama\" which was really a good thing (I love that movie).4. A Fairy Christmas - This was really the only story that didn't feel rushed in the collection. Time was spent on character development and the storyline. I think much of that has to do with the fact that this story takes place during a single evening. Sweet and classic.5. A Fezziwig Christmas - What is up with that last name? Aside from being hung up on the terribleness of the name, I couldn't really get into this story. Too much happened with too many characters in too few pages. I couldn't remember who I wanted to get the girl and who I didn't. My only overall hesitation, as with most short stories, is that they felt so rushed. Four out of the five stories felt like too much happened in a few pages. I find this to be the case with most short romances, but they are still a challenge to fully enjoy."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2458817-karen", "userReview": "Overall, these were good stories that I enjoyed reading.

Each story was well written and I loved the story lines. The first story A Fairy Christmas was a page turner and I was able to connect with the character. It is a tear jerker. I loved the idea of a Fairy Christmas and the ending was wonderful also. This Author really outdid herself. The story of The Christmas Promise was romantic and I laughed throughout it at Sean as he kept finding his self in a fix and I liked how he could laugh at his self. I also liked how Mauve was always so witty. I liked how Sean really tried to keep his Christmas promise and how at the end that you found out how Old Tom came to tell the story. This Story was a real page turner also. The Story Twelve Months was really good it was a tear jerker. It is sad but I like how Lucien never gave up. A real page turner. I was able to feel for Cora. A Fizziwig Christmas was a wonderful read and I loved how it portrayed Ebenezer Scrooge and a young man in love. I also loved how Dick was a not sure of his self but glad that all turned out well with him also. It also had me laughing throughout the story. This story was also well written. The story of A Taste of Home was a real tear jerker it was sad that Claire was stuck not being able to go home for Christmas and I also laughed at some of the antics that Will had done to her. Sometimes little boys just doesn't now how to act with boys but was glad the Claire was able to look over it all in the end. Will went out and beyond to bring Christmas to Claire and that is what most girls hope to have for a man. This story will melt your heart. My Modern Girl was a good read. Margie was looking for something different and here Henry was in love with her and she just couldn't see it. He is what it means for a man to love a women as he went and showed Margie that he could be the kind of man she was wanting. Each and every story was well written as I have said and if you are into reading a stories where the man goes out and beyond to please a woman then you need to read this book as you will find it here in one book. I cried, laughed, got angry at times as I was reading. It is well worth your money.

I enjoyed all of the stories but three of them really stood out. Fairy Christmas by Lucinda Brant is the first story in the anthology. It took me awhile to get into it because there were a lot of characters and I had a hard time keeping track of everyone. I also wanted it to be longer so that I could see more of the relationship with Kitty and Tom.A Christmas Promise by Sarah Eden was set in Ireland and I enjoyed the witty conversations between Maeve and Sean. I also liked the chaperone Rufus. :-)Twelve Months by Heather Moore was about Lucien Baxter who has his best friend Will die. Will made Lucien promise to marry his widow Cora. Cora turns him down but they get to know each other during the Christmas season. Lucien's loyalty to his friend helps Cora learn to trust him and I loved seeing their relationship blossom.Fezziwig Christmas by LuAnn Brobst Staheli was probably my least favorite out of all of them. It was about Ebenezer Scrooge and his friend Dick as they courted Fezziwig's daughters. A Taste of Home by Annette Lyon was my favorite story. Claire Jennings is traveling home to Utah for Christmas with her childhood tormentor Will Rhodes. However, when she gets there she learns her family is in quarantine and she can't see them. Will suggests they stay in town together and works hard to make it memorable for her and prove his love for her. It reminded me of Anne and Gilbert's relationship which is probably why I enjoyed it so much.My Modern Girl by Becca Wilhite was also one of my favorites. Margie thinks that she needs to become a modern girl so she leaves her old-fashioned boyfriend Henry behind to move to New York and become a saleslady at Macy's.

I had trouble following who the characters were. It almost felt like there should have been a prior story outlining the characters and their circumstances or something.However, the next novella (A Christmas Promise by Sarah Eden) was so sweet! I wanted it to continue with the next chapter in the characters lives! I loved the characters and cheered for them to find happiness amidst their struggles.Twelve Months by Heather B.
