Savannah is a completely different type of book. The main character is a young girl, which makes the book feel like it is geared toward the teenage crowd. Descriptions are not very detailed and all of the action that takes place is void of any feeling of excitement. I was expecting something similar to Charleston with its complex families and detailed descriptions of places and events. My main purpose for reading this book was the hope that I would learn a little more about a city I enjoy visiting. Obviously, I was unable to get a better view of the city of Savannah and I got little worth out of the book in general."}, {"userName": "Peggy ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33865609-peggy", "userReview": "John Jakes is one of my favorite authors but this book didn't do it for me.

After reading fifty pages or so of Savannah I thought, \"This is not the John Jakes I remember.\" In addition to the \"historical novel\" label you could also add his previous novels to your \"thriller\" list. It started rather slowly, in my opinion, and never did develop into a \"thriller;\" it served up action but is not a thriller. The protagonists include a relatively young widow and mother, her daughter, and their friends who are, for the most part, women but it falls short of the \"chick lit\" label. It is a \"slice of life\" story about how the residents of Savannah deal with the Union occupation of their city.

This quaint little (by Jakes' standards) Christmas story, if you can call any book set during Sherman's March to the Sea \"quaint\", Is a somewhat quiet interlude lasting from the newly established Thanksgiving, 1964, through a couple of weeks into the new year. Yes, there is looting and destruction by both Yankees and Rebs, but Savannah plays the perfect host, welcoming their enemies hoping to avoid the burning experienced by the neighboring city of Atlanta. Here we meet General William T Sherman, an unusual type of soldier, slovenly in appearance but determined to end this war once and for all.Yet, Sherman is not the main event. This is the story of twelve year old Harriet and her widowed mother, Sara Lester, who are forced to leave behind their rice farm and move into Savannah when the fields are flooded by the rebs to help slow the advance of Sherman's army. Moving in with her best friend, Mrs Vastley Rohrschamp (who both fears and secretly welcomes the idea of being somehow defiled by the enemy), the three women try to get by as best they can in times of uncertainty and poverty. Hattie, a headstrong, reckless young lady, is the main focus as she wages her own battle against the Yankees, even going so far as to kick General Sherman in the shins. His reaction surprises her, and afterwards she feels comfortable enough to ask him for assistance when the need arises. Still, Hattie admits they can never be friends since her heart belongs to Dixie and she cannot forgive the deaths of her father and others who were killed in the war. There's some violence, some love, some evil doers, and some kindhearted gentlemen looking out for the three companions. As I said, a sweet little wartime Christmas story.This one was perfect for listening, with an abridged audiobook read by Dylan Baker. Oh, and the subtitle \"A Gift for Mr Lincoln\" refers to the telegram Sherman wired to President Lincoln on December 22nd with the message, \u201cI beg to present you, as a Christmas gift, the city of Savannah, with 150 heavy guns and plenty of ammunition, and also about 25,000 bales of cotton.\u201dThree stars."}, {"userName": "Kim Boulware", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4825393-kim-boulware", "userReview": "[ Winks a kind union spoiler saves a slave from drowning in ebenezer creek.Me vee home off is invaded.

I also enjoyed, but to a lesser extent, Charleston, which did a decent job of marrying historical fact with fiction. Having finished Savannah, I found it entertaining enough to finish but not good enough to recommend to anyone other than the most die-hard Jakes fans or young readers ranging from, perhaps, 10-14 years of age.Basically, I would classify Savannah as a \"John Jakes-Lite\" book. This is because I found it to be \"lite\" in several areas I look for in a good book. Specifically, I found its plot to be overly simplistic and his most simplistic to-date; and his characters to be one-dimensional, clich\u00e9d and only serviceable, at best. Further, while the book had moments of tension, it lacked sufficient action and suspense, and what it did provide was predictable.

Since this book is historical fiction, I believe that the purpose of this book is to also inform. If you don't know a lot about history then this could also inform you. You have to be careful what you take as fact, because this is still fiction.  The theme of this book I believe is that in times of great sorrow and sadness there can still be happiness. This theme can be shown throughout the book especially in the plot of the book which evolves from sorrow to a more positive attitude. This can also be shown as that \"There is hope in times of sorrow.\"  I feel that this book is written in two styles. I believe that this book is written in a descriptive and a narrative style. This is in a descriptive style because this is written as \"an explanation of a particular time, place, or event to make the reader feel like they're experiencing it first hand.\" This is also written in a narrative style because it is \"a telling of a story through a series of events that describes what happened, in chronological order.\" For example on page 130 of the hard cover book the page says on the top \"Pulaski House, 9:15 p.m.\" or on page 165 when it says \" Camp of the 81st Indiana, 5 p.m.\" These quotes show that this is written in a descriptive. Those quotes also show some narrative style because it is showing how the story is shown that time is going on. The story is progressing throughout time and describes in large amounts of detail what is happening. This quote shows just how much detail is put into this story (pg 154) \"Stephen left the Pulaski House thirty minutes later buzzy-headed state of inebriation.\" This story progresses through the story and expands on what we know about each character showing the narrative side of the story. I really like this book. This is one of my favorite books except for the fact that it is still technically fiction. This book would have 5 stars otherwise. I like books that have a lot of detail in them so I can visualize what is going on in the book. This book definitely has a lot of detail (pg 154) \"Stephen left the Pulaski House thirty minutes later buzzy-headed state of inebriation.\" This shows a lot of detail is put into this story. I also like many stories that stick with the same characters the whole way through the story. \"Hattie showed her fist\" (pg 4) and \"Hattie sat up straighter\" (pg 265) show that Jakes stayed with characters the whole way through the story and didn't get rid of them. The part I like most about the book was the story line that it followed to get to the end. Again I did not like that much that this story was fiction because I am not one to like a book not being all fact. For whom this book is targeted for and the people that will probably read it I would not change a thing about this book. This is like some books that I have read but it is also so different because of how John Jakes writes which makes this book so amazing."}, {"userName": "Tamhack", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2212378-tamhack", "userReview": "This is the story of Sherman's occupation of Georgia from the occupants view point. It was a good thing that Sherman played a part in ending the Civil War but he was black and white about it. This black and white attitude of Sherman's carried on into his career with the Indians--he felt that all the Indians were to be on the reservations, end the story, period.So with Sherman's attitude and move forwardness no matter what the cost, the people of Savannah did have many fears, misgivings about Sherman being there and what was going to happen next. This book tries to change the people of Savannah views and our view of Sherman. In this small town, it tries to reconcile the North and the South.For example: Winks one of the Union soldiers rescued a migrant Negro, Zip, and now Zip has attached himself to Winks for saving his life. This is what Winks has to say:\"Wink's exasperation with Zip was nearly limitless. Why had he allowed this fellow to attach himself, leech like, and follow him everywhere? He despised Negroes for what they'd done to his family, though he had a certain reluctant liking for Zip personally; it had sort of crept up on him after Ebenezer Creek, while he was, so to speak, busy elsewhere.Was it possible to like the person and dislike the race? Winks wasn't sufficiently educated to answer the question. His head hurt when he tried. His head hurt now.\" 131171--In this part of the book, the opinion was expressed that even though Sherman's methods were harsh, many people included Lincoln were relieved that he was successful: \"I recalled President's Lincoln's dark moods after long years with incompetent generals who brought our side little success...\"I like the afterword at the end explaining what was fact and fiction; how the novel came about and where some of the characters went on with their lives.317-\" William Tecumseh Sherman lived a long life as a Union hero and notable public figure. Isaiah Fleeg calls Sherman a bigot. Scholars generally regard this view as correct, though he was not unlike millions of others of his time. He expressed liking for blacks generally; he loathed slavery and slave owners, but he didn't believe the black men capable of bearing arms as front-line troops, even though, as mentioned in the story, they had already proved themselves, notably in the attack on Battery Wagner during the siege of Charleston in July 1863.\"\"He was an effective leader, more interested in results than display. By nature or inspiration, he was also a military genius. When he struck out from Atlanta in the autumn of 1864, at age forty-four, he conceived and led a march that is considered a sort of masterpiece in the art of war.\""}, {"userName": "Benjamin Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Nov 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4209082-benjamin-thomas", "userReview": "John Jakes is another one of \"my\" authors, or an author that I will pretty much purchase and read anything they publish. Over the years, these authors have changed somewhat, particularly if there is a downard trend in quality. \"Savannah: or A Gift for Mr Lincoln\" ranks on the lower end of Mr Jakes' work but still there is enough enjoyment here to keep him on my list. His last three books have suffered some so he's pushing it a little but his age would dictate there aren't too many novels left in him anyway.This particular novel is one of his shorter ones and is a fairly light read. He takes a tiny part of General Sherman's famous \"March to the Sea\" campaign near the end of the Civil War, namely that of the days and weeks surrounding the taking of Savannah during late December 1864. Sherman, to this day, is often a hated man in the South due to this campaign which they see as unneccesarily harsh to the farmers and other non-combatants of the region. But Sherman intended to break the back of the South and make them plea for peace and end the war sooner. Not all that unlike another controversial decision almost a century later with the dropping of atom bombs on Japan.The story here though is not about warfare or tactics or political decisions. Rather, it brings it all down to the personal level, as we follow the story of how ordinary people in Savannah deal with what is happening around them. It's a fairly basic story and the characters represent a cross section of society at that time. One of the main characters is a twelve year old girl and as a result, the novel almost reads as a young adult novel. Certainly there is no swearing or sex in this book. General Sherman does put in a couple of appearances and comes across more as an understanding grandfather than the root of all evil. This, ultimately, is a book about Christmas and the spirit of that time of the year so understanding the other person's point of view is easier, or at least people do tend to work harder at it. I will say that I continue to be inspired by the historical accuracy of Mr Jakes' work. He always manages to sprinkle in quite a few historical tidbits and that makes his books fun to read."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Apr 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1355442-steve", "userReview": "Mailing it in\u2026Jakes is totally mailing it in. \u2026and frankly just grabbing at extra money.

We just visited Savannah for a quick 24 hrs., enjoying a trolley tour and a nice evening on the Riverfront. That was enough to convince me to return some day, to explore the many public squares and historic buildings. Although like most Southern Cities, Savannah suffered damage during the Civil War, but nothing like the utter destruction of Atlanta. When General William T.Sherman finished his march through Georgia in Savannah, he must have been tired of the scorched earth. He famously offered the city to President Lincoln as a \"Christmas Present.\" That Savannah Christmas of 1864 is the background and soul of Jakes' novel. The author admits to his desire to write a warm-hearted Christmas story. As a result, it lacks the grit and edge that one might otherwise expect - and that I usually enjoy -- in a war story. In fact, it comes across pretty lame, or simple as a children's book. The not-that-simple plot involves an adolescent Hattie and her widowed mother as the advance of Sherman's army prompts them to leave their struggling rice plantation for safety in the city. When Savannah is taken by the Northern troops, the rest of the story plays out - what I'd call minor dramas: Hattie's mean relative the \"Judge\" is maneuvering to confiscate their property; scavenging union soldiers covet their piano and Hattie's pet pig; a dashing union officer rescues them and wants to woo Hattie's mother; Hattie's wounded soldier \"boyfriend\" helps her make Christmas presents for poor little black kids; an evil carpetbagger kidnaps their loyal black servant in a war-profiteering scheme; Hattie gets mad and kicks General Sherman in the shin; the General provides Christmas dinner for the whole family; etc., etc.Oh, well, it's a Christmas story."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124058-sandy", "userReview": "This book was interesting and a quick read, but I lost much of my interest in the book when the author repeatedly implied that one of the main characters (an overweight woman with apparently no male suitors) was secretly hoping to the possibility of \"outrages\" being committed upon her by the Union soldiers.
