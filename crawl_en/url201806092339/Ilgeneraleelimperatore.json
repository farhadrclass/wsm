Now, I jump into this work of fiction and finds that author James Webb, in this novel about General MacArthur, delves into the politics that prevented certain high-ranking Japanese officials from being prosecuted for war crimes after the so-called \"rape of Nanking\" (Manchuria) and the \"rape of Manilla.\" The actual officers in charge of these events were not charged with war crimes, but instead there were various scapegoats offered in their place. Along the way, Webb introduces us to insiders in MacArthur's military regime as he assumed the enormous task of rebuilding Japan and attempting to bring it into the 20th century. Webb shows us some of the reasons that the general protects the Japanese emperor and his closest advisors\\family members in order-- primarily to encourage the adoption of a new more democratic constitution, the abolition of \"secret police\" and to introduce sweeping reforms.Our eyewitness to this is Captain Jay Marsh, a Japanese interpreter, who at first seems to almost worship the great general, but gradually becomes disillusioned with the political machinations he observes and the grave injustices of the war crimes trials, etc. Webb writes a fantastic and in-depth novel about the end and aftermath of the Pacific War..."}, {"userName": "Carlito Virina", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5894780-carlito-virina", "userReview": "Written by US senator James Webb, The Emperor's General tells a more entertaining, engaging and thought-provoking story than the Tommy Lee Jones/Matthew Fox movie about 1945 Japan \"The Emperor.\" Makes you wish it happened the way James Webb wrote it."}, {"userName": "abi gaskins", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4354880-abi-gaskins", "userReview": "My most favorite book ever!

Jim Webb is a great novel. More on that, but first a few words about the Senator.Jim Webb was on the podium, debating for the Democratic nomination for President a couple month's ago with Hillary, Bernie and the other guy. I was hoping that all of the aspects of his amazing biography would override his obvious reluctance to submit himself to the US presidential process. He grew up in a military family, went to the Navel Academy and lost a disputed boxing decision to a much bigger Ollie North for his class championship. Then he went to Vietnam as a Marine officer, and won a Silver Star, and other medals, including two purple hearts. He got a Law degree from Georgetown, was Reagan's assistant Secretary of the Navy, was an award winning journalist, wrote highly praised novels, turned Democrat and beat the once Republican Presidential hopeful George Allen for the Virginia Senate. There is even more, look him up. I imagined him as the perfect populist candidate. He didn't need to copy Bernie's policy direction of course, but he did need to focus on his 'Democratic' credentials, which if you look at his voting record in the Senate is real. But, we are in a weird political times, and perhaps that trumps accomplishment and character. The last thing he said on the podium, before dropping out of the race was to imply how he had personally killed a Vietcong soldier in battle. That wasn't going to sway Hillary and Bernie's voters, who should have been his target audience. But it highlights his other problem which is his consistent history of flipping off the powerful. One example \u2013 when he was in the Senate, President Bush Jr. asked him about his son, who was serving in Iraq. Webb told Bush in a very pointed way that that was between him and his son. All of that, all of his many accomplishments, pale in comparison to his talent to tell a story. The Emperor's General is the best novel I have read in years. On the surface, it is a history novel about Gen MacArthur and the last couple years of WW2 and six months into the occupation of Japan. It deals primarily with one of the almost unknown chapters of the war, the trial, conviction and execution of Japanese General Yamanshita for war crimes in the Philippines. It is told through the eyes of a young American Army Captain, Jay Marsh, who through a series of plausible and well crafted incidents, become a fly on the wall of MacArthur's deliberations and eventually becomes a player in the high level diplomatic game between MacArthur and the Japanese Emperor.Marsh narrates and his story over-shadows the 'big story' without skipping any of the subtle details of MacArthur's maneuvers. It is great history, explaining the larger significance of the Japanese occupation, while putting you on the ground, coming ashore with MacArthur as he validates his \u201cI shall return\u201d promise to the Philippines, as well as in Yokohama and Tokyo after the surrender. The discriptions and the context that Webb presents will astonish you and give you a feel for the entire panorama of the time and place. But that is not why the Emperor's General is a truly great book. Marsh is forced to leave the arms of a beautiful, trusting woman to enter into the highest levels of the Japanese Geisha world. He loves both women. This powerful and tender love story is understated and tactile and seems so true. Jay is forced into unfaithfulness, by his duty, an unfaithfulness most men would consider the highlight of their romantic life. Jay accepts the assignment, in fact makes the most of his sexual opportunity, all the while knowing it was destroying his one hope for happiness. It is unapologetically a man's story. Men don't get many novels that explain the torments of the heart, particularly in a way that weaves it into the thrill of world-shaking ambition. Webb \u2013 a smart, tough guy, who in real life told a feckless President to kiss off \u2013 will break your heart with this novel. The historical gossip, the depiction of the real human side of near-mythical personalities \u2013 (like Emperor Hirohito) \u2013 all of that is delicious reading, but it all stands down in the presence of a great and painful love story.Webb is a great writer, and ultimately that is a higher calling than politics."}, {"userName": "Charlie Canning", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16514518-charlie-canning", "userReview": "A highly readable, immensely entertaining work of historical fictionWhile Author James Webb doesn't attempt to tell the whole story of the \"War in the Pacific\" in The Emperor's General, he does cover a considerable part of it. After a short prologue, the novel begins with General Douglas MacArthur and the Allied landing at Leyte in 1944. The first part of the book is set in the Philippines and chronicles the history of the war there from Corregidor and Bataan in 1942 to the re-taking of Manila in 1945. The story is told from the point of view of Captain Jay Marsh, a junior officer and Japanese interpreter on MacArthur's staff. Marsh meets a beautiful Filipina named Divina Clara (as in \"Maria Clara\", the prototypical Filipina beauty of Spanish blood and feminine grace) and their love affair becomes the subplot of the historical narrative.The two main characters, however, are the \"Emperor's generals\"; Douglas MacArthur and Yamashita Tomoyuki. So intertwined are their careers and their fates that the title of the book is wonderfully ambiguous. Who, after all, was \"the Emperor's general?\" Was it Douglas MacArthur, the victorious American general who swept into Tokyo to become the supreme commander of the Allied occupation? Although ostensibly an enemy of Japan, MacArthur had as much to do with the preservation of the emperor system as any man. Was he \"the Emperor's general?\" Or was it Yamashita Tomoyuki, \"the Tiger of Malaya,\" who time and time again, outsmarted and outmaneuvered superior forces in first Singapore and then the Philippines? Was he Emperor Hirohito's general?Sadly, both MacArthur and, if we can believe the novel's rhetoric, the Imperial Japanese Government felt threatened by Yamashita's quiet dignity and popular appeal: \"... the possible impact of Tomoyuki Yamashita's return to Japan, where he might state his case before the same international tribunal that General Tojo and the others would face in a few months, was more than the supreme commander or the emperor, either one, could bear. Dead or alive, the stoic, patient Yamashita would survive that forum as a national hero, one whose vision, dignity, and exploits might overshadow every other figure in the Pacific war.\"Yamashita's \"trial\" by a military tribunal and subsequent hanging in the Philippines was by most accounts, a mockery and a sham: \"It was December 6. MacArthur, with his penchant for anniversaries, had arranged for the verdict to be read to the world during a live, fifteen-minute radio address on Pearl Harbor Day. That night the twelve American, British, and Australian journalists who had covered every moment of the trial were polled by the International News Service in a secret ballot. Asked if the evidence presented at the trial warranted Yamashita's conviction, all twelve voted Yamashita innocent.\"By all estimates, Douglas MacArthur was one of the principal architects of modern Japan. What makes The Emperor's General so interesting is that the novel suggests that things might have been done differently both by MacArthur and the leaders of Japan."}, {"userName": "Frederick Bingham", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7252906-frederick-bingham", "userReview": "The main character of this story is Captain Jay Marsh. He is a low-level aide to General Douglas MacArthur at the end of World War II. The story picks up with MacArthur's re-invasion of the Philippines, moves through the end of the war and into the occupation of Japan. While in the Philippines, Marsh falls in love with a Filipino woman. He is required to leave her when MacArthur moves to Tokyo to oversee the occupation of Japan.While in Tokyo, Marsh befriends one of the Emperor's top aides, Lord Privy Seal Kido. Marsh speaks fluent japanese, and moves easily in high circles in the japanese government. He takes on the role of back channel negotiator between MacArthur and the Imperial government. He also starts up an affair with a geisha provided by Kido.The other part of the story is the war crimes trial of General Yamashita in Manila. Yamashita was the Japanese general in charge of the army in the Philippines while it was being occupied by Japan. Many atrocities were committed during this time period and Yamashita was blamed for them. The book takes the position that Yamashita was not responsible for the bad behavior, and the whole trial was a cover-up for the leadership provided by the Emperor and his close relatives. One of Marsh's duties was to attend and report to MacArthur on the war crimes trial held in Manila.The author of this book is a newly-elected Senator from Virginia. The book cogently describes the history of the period and the moral ambiguity facing people in this situation. It gives one hope that such a person as the author could now be in power at the highest levels of government."}, {"userName": "Harold Kasselman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16965781-harold-kasselman", "userReview": "I was floored by how fascinating this book was. It provided me with great insight into the Japanese culture: especially how it related to the efforts to end the war and build a peaceful Japan. The author's knowledge of the back scene negotiations with the Emperor via the Privy Seal and MacArthur were captivating and enthralling. I felt as if I were in the innermost circle of MacArthur's profound decision making about how to end the war without mortally wounding Japanese pride. The book confirmed for me that the Supreme Commander saved thousands of American lives(and Japanese) by his realpolitik approach to the big picture rather than executing the former Emperor Hirohito and the royal family. You will be fascinated by the \"belly talk\" negotiations that led to the final solution and the ultimate sacrifice of Japanese General Yamashita to mollify the allies. On another level, there is a heartbreaking love story between Captain Jay Marsh the protagonist and his Filipino lover that is quite moving and haunting. For me, this is 10 stars. I salute you James Webb."}, {"userName": "BBJWEIHE", "userReviewDate": "Oct 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26004259-bbjweihe", "userReview": "Superb novel about a very unique place and time. This book relives the Post VJ period from 1945 onward, as the United States, led by General Douglas MacArthur, leads the post WWII recovery of Imperial Japan. The story is told through the eyes of a young military officer, who serves as General MacArthur's aide/executive officer. The young officer, who also speaks Japanese, influences the policy and events of this period because of his language skills, position of responsibility and extraordinary level of trust endowed by MacArthur himself.

From there, the book seemed to be about how one guy ruined two women's lives with his selfish desires. If that was the author's intent, he did it flawlessly.

He had witnessed the bloody horror left behind by the retreating Japanese army during World War II's final days. And he had abandoned his beautiful Filipina fianc\u00e9e to see his duty through.But not even Marsh could guess the terrible personal price he would have to pay for his loyalty. He would follow General Douglas MacArthur to Tokyo itself. There he would become the brilliant, egocentric general's confidant, translator, surrogate son--and spy.Marsh would play a dangerous game of deliberate deceit and brutal injustice in the shadow world of postwar Japan's royal palaces and geisha houses, and recognize that the defeated emperor and his wily aides were exploiting MacArthur's ruthless ambition to become the American Caesar. The Emperor's General is a dramatic human story of the loss of innocence and the seduction of power, about the conflict between honor, duty, and love, all set against an extraordinary historical backdrop.From the Paperback edition.", "title": "Il generale e l'imperatore", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22052272-il-generale-e-l-imperatore", "average": 4.18, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1399536135l/22052272.jpg", "reviews": 32, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/115559.James_Webb", "name": "James Webb"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Historical", "War", "War"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22052272-il-generale-e-l-imperatore", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/377546.The_Emperor_s_General", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1613306.The_Emperor_s_General", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8465836-the-emperor-s-general", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2574055-the-emperor-s-general", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/198289.Fields_of_Fire", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/223428.Born_Fighting", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/344351.A_Sense_of_Honor", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/319245.Lost_Soldiers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2884304-a-time-to-fight"]}
