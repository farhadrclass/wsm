Only the mighty can bear defeat.\u201d ---- Adolf HitlerSteve Martini, an American best-selling author, pens an exciting yet thrilling new book from his Paul Madriani series, Blood Flag and it is the fourteenth book in the series. This series is centered around a quite renowned Californian attorney, Paul Madriani, flanked by his partner, Harry Hinds and each book in the series unfolds an electrifying chapter and adventure and mystery in Paul's life. Similarly, in Blood Flag too, Paul comes face-to-face yet with a new case and a new challenge to win over until this challenge turns life-threatening and deadly, killing off people, Paul cares about.Synopsis: Defending a client accused of killing her father, attorney Paul Madriani is drawn into a treacherous conspiracy dating to World War II in this enthralling installment in the New York Times bestselling series.Paul Madriani and Harry Hinds have a new client: Emma Brauer, a woman accused in the \u201cmercy killing\u201d of her aged father, Robert Brauer. Insisting she\u2019s innocent, Emma tells Paul about a package sent to her father shortly before he entered the hospital. Bequeathed to him by a member of his unit from World War II, the box contains a key and a slip of paper. Emma fears that this package is connected to her father\u2019s death.When Paul\u2019s young assistant Sofia is murdered Madriani is blindsided by the realization that Emma\u2019s fears are well-grounded.Digging into Robert\u2019s military history, Madriani discovers that other members of the Army unit Robert served with have recently died\u2014under similarly suspicious circumstances. When he finds that the box sent to Brauer relates to a mysterious talisman that went missing at the end of the war\u2014a feared Nazi relic known as the \u201cBlood Flag\u201d\u2014Madriani and Hinds realize they are in for the fight of their lives.With Emma\u2019s life on the line and their own safety in jeopardy, Madriani must uncover the truth before the evil of the Blood Flag is allowed to spin a new web. Paul finds his new client, Emma, an aged woman, amidst the scandal of \"mercy killing\" of her already dying father. And Paul realizes that there is more to it, than just the accusation of \"mercy killing\", but before he could dig more about the confusing revelation made by Emma, Sofia, Paul's assistant-cum-friend, is found dead near Emma's house, where she went to take care of Emma's pet dog. Paul is baffled with the news and before he can recover, he jumps into the investigation to find out what led to the death of Sofia. And also to figure out on whether the murder of Emma's father is somehow connected to Sofia's, before the the body count stops decreasing. The path is not an easy one, as his investigation opens the secret door to Hitler's rule in Germany, where there are dark secrets that not many are aware of. Can Paul and Harry figure out what caused the deaths of handful of innocent souls?This is the first book that I ever read by Steve Martini and I must confess that right now, I'm looking for Steve's previous books on Amazon as the series simply hooked me and I couldn't get enough of Paul and his \"cool and sharp\" demeanor. The story is fantastic and has lots of information about Hitler that can enlighten lots of minds. It seems the author has not only research well but has also portrayed the lesser known facts quite strikingly. The author's writing style glittered with an unique sense of panache which is unmatchable with many popular crime fiction writers. The narrative is engaging to the very core and will keep the readers hooked into the depths of this very story till the end. The pacing is really fast and the story freely flows with unexpected twists and sudden development that will leave even the seasoned crime-fiction readers as puzzled. The mystery is concocted by the author remarkably as he first builds up his mystery laced with enough suspense, misdirection and tension for his readers, and then peeling those layers of suspense one-by-one, hence each and every page will demand reader's attention to stay focused and keep anticipating.The author has not only portrayed the mystery with suspense, but has also painted with lots of actions and frightening moments that will make the readers feel it through their skin.The characters are simply fantastic and the author did a great job in featuring the dynamic set of cast for this book. The primary character, Paul has an unbeatable flair found quite a handful of heroes. His sharp mind and his concern towards his own people will make him stand out in the rest.l The author succeeds in making his readers feel connected with Paul as his character his justified with a backstory. The supporting cast is a myriad of realistic characters among whom some are depicted with their insecurities and some with their scheming mindset.Overall, this is a captivating story that will keep the readers turning the pages of this book till the very end. Verdict:  Crime fiction readers do not miss out this series, particularly this book from the intriguing series. Courtesy:  Thanks to the author, Steve Martini's publicist for giving me the opportunity to read and review this book."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17042835-tim", "userReview": "Stories that glorify Hitler and Nazis sicken and repulse me. 0 of 10 stars"}, {"userName": "Will Hare", "userReviewDate": "May 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/50904075-will-hare", "userReview": "This is actually a two-and-a-half-stars review. I've always loved Martini's writing, but I think he's lost his way. Granted, he seems to be headed in the right direction, but, for me, it's not enough.The issue here is I think he wants to write about espionage and government conspiracy, but he's using the wrong vehicle. Paul Madriani is a well-established character, and his job is a lawyer who gets innocent clients off, most times with wonderful reversals and twists. Better than Grisham in his prime (now light-years better).But to use Paul as a conduit for international intrigue is... it's just wrong, in my opinion. And it's crystal-clear why in this book. He starts with a murder case, which leads to another murder, and it seems like he's going to go up against the prosecutors sooner rather than later....Then it takes a turn when the murders are connected to something, an artifact of sorts, that involves Isreal, Germany, the FBI, and more. You can probably guess what kind of artifact it is based on the countries. Heck, the cover of the book will tell you.Martini spends way too much time trying to figure out the other mystery (yes, it is connected to the two murders, but...), and so we never see the inside of a courtroom, never see plea bargains, never see \"someone didn't tell us the whole story\" scenes. I know those can get old. But Martini made a career out of them. And if he's going to use his best character, then he should use that character in stories where he and his cohorts fit.My advice to Martini would be to either drop the spy intrigue from Madriani, or ditch Madriani to tell the espionage/spy/historical books you've been writing. I'll read his next book, for sure, because he's a great writer. But my disappointment grows with each passing book."}, {"userName": "Scottsdale Public Library", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4332892-scottsdale-public-library", "userReview": "I just finished \"Blood Flag\" by Steve Martini. The story is about Paul Madriani, an attorney in California. He and his partner, Harry Hinds, get a new client, Emma Brauer, who is arrested for the mercy killing of her father.

But \"Blood Flag\" was a big disappointment. Not sure if it was written tongue-in-cheek, but it certainly was a preposterous plot and was also poorly executed. It was as if Martini was thinking to himself, \"How can I make this book even more ridiculous?\" The Paul Madriani series characters were interesting and somewhat endearing, as usual. But the storyline unfolds in a wobbly sort of way; it just doesn't flow. My main beef, though, is how outlandish the plot became. It begins innocently enough with Madriani representing an older woman arrested for the mercy killing of her elderly father, Robert Brauer. Turns out her father and two fellow WW II soldiers helped liberate Munich and helped themselves to Nazi souvenirs. Rumors abound about the existence of the \"blood flag\", a Nazi flag saturated in the blood of a Nazi killed during an early attempt by Hitler to take over the German government. The flag draws interest from collectors as well as white supremacist groups, the Israelis, and even Muslim terrorist groups. Madriani and his team are swept up in unraveling the clues and trying to find Brauer's real killer, with treachery at every turn. For me, \"Blood Flag\" was just a little too much. Martini should stick with his successful crime and courtroom dramas."}, {"userName": "Rita Berk", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51909577-rita-berk", "userReview": "Lawyer Paul Madriani gets caught up in a case involving a Nazi war relic, the \"Blood Flag\" of the title.

I saw it listed on Audible\u2019s suggest reading list and decided to buy it. I have always enjoyed Steve Martini\u2019s writing.Paul and his partner Harry Hinds have a new client, Emma Brauer. Emma is accused of murdering her father, Robert Brauer, for his money. Paul has his new legal assistant Sofia check into a package left at Robert Brauer\u2019s home just before he was murdered. Paul is notified by the police that Sofia\u2019s body has been found murdered near Robert Brauer\u2019s home. Paul discovers that Robert Brauer was stationed in Munich at the end of WWII and his team was searching for a \u201cblood flag\u201d which was a Nazi flag used by Hitler. He also discovers all members of the unit are dead by mysterious means.The book is well written and researched. The characters are interesting as is the plot, which twists and turns every which way. I remember the Martini books I read in the past were mostly courtroom dramas. This book is primarily an international thriller. I did find it interesting because of the World War II connection.

This, like its more recent predecessors, does not involve courtroom action, which made Martini great but instead international action and intrigue. I wish Martini would get back to the courtroom. However, this is a good book. Paul has a client who is accused of killing her elderly father-a mercy killing since he is sick. The father was a World War II vet who was in Munich when Hitler was brought down. It is believed that he and a couple of buddies have a Nazi flag that was soaked in the blood of a Hitler fanatic which Hitler waved at rallies to fire up his people. The two buddies died mysteriously prior to Emma's father being killed. Where is the flag? Who wants it? What is it worth? What will people do it get the flag?I enjoy the witty back and forth between characters in Martini books. I can picture Paul's partner Harry. Harry is dating a local judge at the time which spices things up a little. Another fun read but not as good as his courtroom dramas.

The action in the Madriani series is sparse but intense, and this is among the better entries in the series. Mr. Madriani is most comfortable in describing facts and exposition in the third person, and does this with the economy of a legal brief at times which can feel a bit dry. Motives in his stories are normally those of greed or revenge powered by greed, and there is an unreality to the banter between the recurring characters as regards their professional motives. I recommend it if the afternoon is rainy."}, {"userName": "Lagniappe", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/65351294-lagniappe", "userReview": "I've read previous Steve Martini books and always enjoyed them - but this one just didn't capture my imagination.
