A female main character, social issues, historical fiction - yup - it's tailor-made for a bunch o' gals to sit around and discuss whilst sipping wine. And, it is actually this month's selection for my real-life book club.I was all set to hate this book's guts.But . . . I loved it.Do not, I repeat DO NOT read the Goodreads description of this book. It's gives away something I did not want to know, and you won't want to either. All you need to know is that this is about a Quaker family in Pennsylvania who help escaped slaves traveling the underground railroad. Does it really deserve five stars? Probably not. The writing is serviceable, but not fantastic. Some parts of the plot require quite a suspension of disbelief, and others may want to make you roll your eyes. And yet, taken as a whole, I think it works. Lastly, it meets my personal criteria for a five-star read - 1. yes, I would read it again, and 2. it made me cry. Maybe it's just the hormones, but I sniffed more than Trump at a debate over this exchange:\n\"It's beautiful, you know,\" I told him.\"What is?\"\"Life. Beautiful in its beginning. Beautiful in its ending. Beautiful because it goes on. Because when you think its over, it has just begun. One life ends and another begins, and we are all a part of it. None immune to its sufferings; none excluded from its joys. It's all there for the taking.\nOh, you Quakers . . . you spout wisdom, make me cry, AND give me nutritious oatmeal. Is there nothing you can't do?"}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "Redfield Farm by Judith Redline Coopey- A novel of The Underground Railroad.This is a well written and easy to read Novel set in the time of slavery and the Underground Railroad. I have to admit I was ignorant about the The Underground Railroad and enjoyed reading and learning about this time in history.This is an interesting story very simply told. The story is set in the mid 1800s and the main characters The Redfield family are Quaker and live in a solidly Quaker community. This family are non-violent yet brother and sister Jesse and Ann will go to any lengths to help fugitive slaves escape. I enjoyed the insight into Quaker life and how they put their own lives at risk in their involvement in gaining freedon for slaves. I really enjoyed this novel as it had enough historical facts to keep me interested."}, {"userName": "Mary Mascari", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5620249-mary-mascari", "userReview": "Not a bad book, really. More of a series of vignettes around one character than a unified novel. Interesting setting and a likable main character, but it never really grabbed me. I only finished it because I was waiting for new books to arrive in the mail.I'm not sure if too much happened in the book, or not enough. She just skimmed through huge events in a few paragraphs, and nothing really bad happened. I mean, people died and got injured, but it was always kind of OK. I don't buy that she would have slept with Josiah so casually, and laughed out loud when the man she married showed up just as her sister suggested she find a husband. Since everything turned out OK very quickly, there wasn't a lot of suspense."}, {"userName": "Carole", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7630646-carole", "userReview": "I loved this book so much, I didn't want it to end.

Why didn't I read it sooner?? Through the voice of Ann Redfield, Judith Coopey tells us what life was like for Quakers during the Civil War. Quakers who helped the Underground Railroad. Ann Redfield is a curious girl who grows into a strong woman. Though she falters once (I won't spoil the story), her faith and values guide her through life. I must admit, though, I found myself asking repeatedly, \"Do women like Ann actually exist? Women who are in such command of themselves, so sure of their faith, and who are strong enough to endure so much??\" I sure hope so. As for Coopey's writing style, she has a way of using Ann's voice to introduce us to other characters and events as if we were there ourselves. She includes interesting details about Quaker life, the Underground Railroad, and life in the mid-19th century, but she does it without wasting words. She also provides closure at the end of the book, which is something I value greatly when I'm hooked on a story. I'm not a fan of wondering about what happened to the characters I've come to love. In my opinion, Coopey is a truly talented writer. I'm actually downloading her other two books now, Waterproof: A Novel of the Johnstown Flood and Looking for Jane. I will save them for a time when I can savor every word."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4412133-jill", "userReview": "I haven't read a book this well written and powerful since The Help last year. I got this book for 99 cents on an Amazon daily deal and I'm so glad I chose it. I loved the story of Ann and her brother Jesse and their work on the underground railroad. The book was well researched and very informative about the years leading up to the civil war. This author had the ability to create suspense from seemingly nothing. Every time one of the siblings went on a \"delivery\" of slaves attempting freedom, I was on the edge of my seat hoping for a safe return. The suspense was never forced, but seemed to flow naturally from the page. I'm impressed. I don't know if this is the only book by this author, but I intended to find and read more by Judith Redline Coopey.

So I was excited to read it. However, the writing felt amateurish to me. The characters didn't grab me. And it always grates on me when an author describes someone as \"skipping\" down a lane. Really, who skips (except a young girl, and even then, very rarely). So I gave up. When you've got a Jane Smiley novel from the library, and it's just begging you to open it and read it before it has to go back to the library, then it's okay to give up on a book that just isn't quite making it. Right?"}, {"userName": "Mindy", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4348576-mindy", "userReview": "This is a book that is written simply and beautifully.

Thankfully, I came upon \"Looking for Jane\" first, if reversed I would never have read another book by this author.The main character \"Ann\" did not add up. Here we have a very mature young woman with strong convictions of her faith, respect of family and home responsibilities. She is hurt emotionally by a man who she presumes to marry but he marries another. Here's my problem with this story... shortly after this news and totally out of her character with no regard for her own self respect, strong convictions to her Quaker faith or her family she has a quick fling in the small hideaway upstairs with a man who they are hiding in order to help him escape to Canada!!! I really found that hard to believe according to the strong character painted of her by this author! Supposedly she was a VIRGIN yet she is able to gather her clothes and look presentable in a moments notice when they hear people entering the house...another hard to believe scene. This man they are hiding had confided to her he was married and in love with another woman yet was more than happy to accommodate her pathetic misery and pride by servicing her needs. Somehow according to this book, she respects that behavior in him after just getting dumped...this did not add up either. Of course she became pregnant from the fling and later takes a journey to find the man and his wife and gives the baby to them. His wife so understanding of his former infidelity gladly takes the baby in and raises him. The book was so unrealistic nothing added up. Possibly it could have been believable had they painted Ann as rebellious and needy for men in youth but after learning from her mistakes turns into a fine mature woman."}, {"userName": "Jeri", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4916971-jeri", "userReview": "Moving story about a Quaker family in Pennsylvania who becomes very involved in the Underground Railroad before and during the Civil War. But the story doesn't start or end there - gives insights into the Quaker life during the period, the strength of one woman, Ann Redfield, who keeps her family - and extended family - together during many many difficult times. Her devotion to her older brother involves her in the Railroad, which leads her to an innocent tryst with one of their rescues, which leads to his freedom in Canada and her pregnancy - can you imagine having a child under those circumstances? She's a pretty phenomenal woman, and this is just one of many of the trials put before her and her family -- good historical read about what the Quakers did to help the slaves during the period and also a good read about a special, strong woman. Almost 4 stars but not quite."}, {"userName": "Bria", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5937768-bria", "userReview": "This is more than a story of the underground railroad. It is the story of a lifetime in a Quaker family and a beautifully woven story, at that. It follows the life of the main character, Ann Redfield, in first person through her own and familial adventures, toil, terror, joy, love and laughter. I could tell that the historical setting of this book was researched meticulously and was not surprised at all to learn in the About the Author at the end that the author is a native of Pennsylvania and a student of her state's history.

However, I didn't like it enough for a 3 star rating. All throughout the book I kept asking what is this book really about? It seemed to be about the Underground Railroad at first. And then about being a Quaker, then moved to an interracial relationship but then it changed to being black in a white world, and then rounded out with being about the civil war. And that's where the book lost some stars for me. Ultimately I decided it was a book about life and how life goes on regardless of these huge events that shape the world around us.

The story is told by, and follows the life of the main character Ann Redfield from her earliest memories to just prior to her death, as an aging woman. Dealing with far more than just the underground railroad it is a story about the Quaker community, which to be honest, really sounded wonderful during this time period, before modernization began to challenge their communities. Some what \"Steinbeckish\" as it deals with the trials of basic life and everyday tradgedies rather than any single momentus event, it pulls the reader into Ann's life. The underground railroad provides for moments of tradgedy as well as moments of uplifting rewards.

We follow the Redfield family, as told from Ann Redfield's point of view. Ann and her family become a part of the Underground Railroad moving slaves to freedom. Along the way, we follow the comings and goings of Ann's ever-changing and growing family; the joys and the heartaches, their love of their family, community and Friends, enduring the betrayal of others, the dangers of being conductors, and the ravages of war. I appreciated Ann's down-to-earth ways, her ability to love, to give all, to be human, and to be forgiving. It's a page turner of a novel and reminds me a lot of \"These is My Words\".

The story was interesting to see how lives were impacted by the underground railroad during the civil war - not just the fleeing slaves, but also the people helping them. Since this book focused specifically on Quaker families helping the escaping slaves it was a little different than others I have read about this era. It was interesting to see how the Quaker beliefs and faith gave people the impetus to help others. The book follows Ann amd her brother Jesse as they grow from their teens into old age.

Ann's devotion to her older brother runs deep, so when he gets involved in the Underground Railroad, Ann asks no questions. She joins him in the struggle. Together they lie, sneak, masquerade and defy their way past would-be enforcers of the hated Fugitive Slave Law. Their dedication to the cause leads to complicated relationships with their fellow Quakers, pro-slavery neighbors and with the fugitives themselves. When Jesse returns from a run with a deadly fever, accompanied by a fugitive, Josiah, who is also sick and close to death, Ann nurses them both back to health. But precious time is lost, and Josiah, too weak for travel, stays the winter at Redfield Farm. Ann becomes his teacher, friend and confidant. When grave disappointment shakes her to her roots, Ann turns to Josiah for comfort, and comfort leads to intimacy. The result, both poignant and inspiring, is life-long devotion to each other and to their cause. Redfield Farm is a tale of compassion, dedication and love, steeped in the details of another time, but resonant with implications for today's world. The author brings a deep understanding of the details of the Underground Railroad which lend authenticity and truth to this tale of a life well-lived and a love well-founded.", "title": "Redfield Farm: A Novel of the Underground Railroad", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11758797-redfield-farm", "average": 4.03, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328345487l/11758797.jpg", "reviews": 299, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3527023.Judith_Redline_Coopey", "name": "Judith Redline Coopey"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Historical", "Military History"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11758797-redfield-farm", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8167307-redfield-farm", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17340573-looking-for-jane", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13550873-waterproof", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23597527-the-furnace", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27403308-brothers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32882045-full-circle", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
