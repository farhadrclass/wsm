The range, from cannibalistic pirates to old pieces of the various armies trying to establish order ring true, and Buroker keeps the tone entertaining and the pacing moving along at a fast clip, which I appreciate. It could so easily bog the story as the point is hammered about personal freedom versus state-imposed order. We're getting various views on it through the characters trying to navigate this changed, and not so great world, rather than the narrative voice ponderously lecturing us on paradigms of state.In this book, we get insight into the earlier lives of several characters, which I also appreciated, one of the high-points being a conversation between Alisa and Alejandro, whose position is at best anomalous.We also get to meet some of the mysterious Starseers, which made for a eyes-glued-to-the-page arc, with some nifty characters emerging, in specific Yumi's eldest half-sister, who I hope shows up again.I can hardly wait for the next installment."}, {"userName": "Dan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26578360-dan", "userReview": "Another enjoyable installment in this light SciFi series."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1242515-hannah", "userReview": "I\u2019m happy to report that Starseers was a massive improvement from Honor\u2019s Flight, because I wasn\u2019t sure what to think after the mixed bag that was the previous book. We finally get to know more about the mysterious Starseers and become better acquainted with Yumi Moon, not to mention there\u2019s some (very much welcome) plot progress as Alisa finds the first real clues she\u2019s had as to her daughter\u2019s whereabouts. After the second book, where nothing much happened at all except for a convoluted series of spaceship battles, it was a vast relief when Alisa\u2019s crew finally located the mysterious Starseer temple \u2013 not only because the plot could finally move along, but because the Starseers were by far the most interesting and complex group introduced in the series thus far. Move aside, Empire and Alliance! For all that they were shady and suspicious, with motivations that Alisa could not understand and did not trust, I found myself wishing that the protagonists could have spent more time at the Starseer temple. There was an intriguing cast of potential allies and enemies there, particularly Yumi\u2019s mother, Ji-yoon, and her sisters Young-hee and Soon-hee. I was rather tickled at the confirmation of Yumi\u2019s Korean background, and I love that Buroker sidestepped the clich\u00e9 \u201cevil half-sisters\u201d trope. Young-hee was a remarkably good sport with a great sense of humour, and I hope she\u2019ll be back in later books. Although we\u2019ve barely seen much of him for now, Abelardus promises to be a very interesting character, too.On the plot and relationship front, I personally am not overly concerned about the overarching plot of Alisa\u2019s missing daughter; it is obvious by now that it is mostly an excuse (for now) to drag her halfway across the galaxy during the search, and won\u2019t come into the forefront until the end. But nevertheless, it is nice to see some progress made, and for Alisa to be reminded that it is her priority. It continues to bother me that Alisa seems to have a one-track mind when it comes to Leonidas; she ultimately always prioritizes him, even if it means fighting against her own side and endangering the general wellbeing of her crew, her ship and her future with her daughter. It\u2019s not Leonidas\u2019 fault that Alisa acts like a love-struck teenage girl (despite being a 30-something widow with a daughter), but I do hope his feelings catch up with hers soon; there are some encouraging signs from Leonidas that he cares for her in this book, but they\u2019re still few and far between. It\u2019s certainly not making it easy for me to get behind this romance when it mostly involves Alisa embarrassing herself with her behaviour. They\u2019d be in danger and she\u2019d make cracks about offering him intimate massages \u2013 it makes me cringe so badly. Alisa is truly badass when she\u2019s piloting a craft through tight spots and fighting off enemies with flashy manoeuvres, though, so as long as we get more space battles and Starseers in the next book and less romance or Alliance/Empire politics, I\u2019m going to be a happy little reader."}, {"userName": "Liviu", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1229019-liviu", "userReview": "the weakest installment in the series as the action devolves into self-parody on many occasions, especially on the Starseers base and the events there and around; the dialogue is still mostly entertaining (though even there there is some repetitiveness that starts becoming noticeable); on the plus side, a few new characters are interesting and one of Yumi's younger (Starseer step)sisters is actually the best new secondary character of the novels so far, while the plot thickens and the general story-line advances; still fairly interested in the series, but I hope the \"jumping the shark\" action sequences and the impermeable plot armor of the main characters will be less noticeable in volume 4"}, {"userName": "Mandapanda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3673972-mandapanda", "userReview": "As well as the edge-of-your-seat fight action, the growing attraction between Alisa and Leonidas, and the fascinating forward movement in the overall plot, this book was really FUNNY!

I am not certain whether I liked this more or less than previous instalments...it's strange, as while I was reading it, I thought maybe it was slightly slower and a bit frustrating with the situation they were in, but actually thinking back on it, I liked all the elements we found out in this one...so I think a 4 stars again.In this instalment we find out a lot more about the Starseers, maybe getting a bit too close to them in fact! There's a lot more fighting and accusations, captures and escapes - I am beginning to wonder how on earth the ship and the crew are still in one piece and still standing after all the scrapes they get in! They don't even seem to get much of a breather in between each bout of excitement!There's a little bit of development in the 'romance' aspect, although I use that term loosely - it's more friendship and trust developing at the moment...although Alisa does seem to be having some rather more-than-friends thoughts in this one! And we meet some interesting characters, some nice, some rather less so...Anyway, one thing I wanted to mention was that I like the way that each episode is nicely wrapped up each time, so that although there is clearly a wider story arc that's continuing, it doesn't leave you on a complete cliffhanger. Instead each book comes to a decent conclusion and the team are then off to the next part of their adventure. Although authors sometimes use more obvious cliffhangers to draw you into the next book, I sometimes find this annoying/off-putting and stop reading, so I much prefer it this way and it's one of the reasons I've found I can keep reading them one after another.Right - carrying straight on with the next one now..."}, {"userName": "Jane", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5701325-jane", "userReview": "Actual rating 3.5 stars.What exactly happened here?

The perfect recipe for a book that I might love.There's something going on between Alisa and Leonidas and I'm rooting for it like crazy!

The Starseers have a reputation that spawns fear in the hearts of just about everyone. It's a good thing that constant peril has led to a bit of trust between the crew, as this isn't going to be any easier than searching the last place to which they were led. As we've journeyed through the Fallen Empire series to this point, I've come to love the characters. Alisa, captain of the Star Nomad, isn't just any young woman \u2013 she's a fighter pilot left in charge of her mother's cargo ship, taking on passengers to make ends meet. Creating a cohesive unit of the people in her charge wasn't something she thought she could do, but here they are. Her Chief of Security, Tommy Beck, is a wannabe chef, and Dr. Alejandro Dominguez is just a mysterious man with a mysterious orb. The attraction between Alisa and the resident cyborg hottie, Leonidas, is heating up, and I think none of us can wait to see how that pans out. The character I perhaps love the most is Mica \u2013 engineer and resident smarty-pants \u2013 reminds me of a friend, and I find I live for her quips. I loved book 2 even more than book 1 \u2026 and I truly think that Starseers (book 3) has topped them as far as storyline goes. Lindsay keeps this group moving, which means we get to watch the mayhem in a variety of locales \u2013 from the library, to space, to the hidden home of the enigmatic Starseers. A lot more light has been shed on the characters, including Dr. Dominguez and his orb. I can't wait to see if Alisa catches up with her daughter soon."}, {"userName": "Hallie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1145657-hallie", "userReview": "I'm just guessing that what I'm about to gripe over begins in this book, given the title, and honestly don't have time to look and check. It does happen quite early in the series, and it keeps happening right until the end, and it's awful. As I said in the brief comments on the first book, this reads at times like a more 'adult' version of the Emperor's Edge series. There's the banter of that series often more sexual in nature, but sometimes it fails badly, and sometimes it's just phoned in with Alisa 'wriggling her eyebrows' so often you had to wonder if she had eyebrow-specific lice. The thing that really got to me, though, was one of the starseers taken on board with them, who uses his psychic powers to get Alisa to kiss him (that's some nasty abuse right there), intention full-on sex, and then KEEPS ON listening in to her thoughts, and sending her suggestive thoughts, which is supposed to be part of the banter. Several books after this starts, another starseer tells Alisa that it's considered terribly rude for an adult starseer to invade anyone's mind uninvited, yet he does so repeatedly, and she protests in a not-terribly serious way, though she is upset by it. This should SO not be part of your bantery wit! For the record, I got 27 uses of the word 'eyebrows' in Fallen Empire alone, which possibly explains why I found the wriggling thereof so aggravating after a while."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/251943-kelly", "userReview": "This series is deeply addictive. From Alisa's irreverent humor to the danger the Star Nomad keeps finding itself in, I'm hooked. Also, I'm deliciously anticipating the oft-mentioned massage Alisa keeps teasing Leonidas with. THOSE TWO.Alisa's faith in the Alliance has taken a beating since we met her in book 1. Things aren't looking up for her in that regard with this book. She's been abandoned, lied to, and ... I don't know, other stuff. She's seeing the cracks in their armor now and what she's finding doesn't seem nearly as honorable as the cyborg who once fought against everything she stood for.Speaking of Leonidas, we got to see a little more of the person who's lurking under his stony facade. He's slowly starting to share pieces of himself and the more we're told, the more I like him.I felt for Yumi. I like Mica's commitment to finding the downside to every situation. I'm not loving on Dominguez, but I'm holding out that he'll grow on me. Eventually. Or he'll betray everything Alisa holds dear and she'll do something drastic.

Cannot believe that I DNF a Lindsay Buroker book!I couldn't stand Alisa at all. I don't understand her attraction to Leonidas, he was just boring. None of the other characters were that interesting and some were downright annoying like Alejandro.

The dialogue was witty, there were great action scenes, a little more suspenseful drama (it's hard when your main character is damn near immortal to put him in jams where he might actually be at mortal risk), and some movement of the main plot lines. There were still long sections where characters never showed their face (for example, if you like Beck, he's barely in this book at all), but that's because these aren't really full-length books that give you a chance to get back to all of the characters, but more like novellas that focus on one little aspect of the story.
