TO BE CONTINUED MOMENTARILYokay. so anyway,our hero gets chosen as one of the vampires to hunt the hepers in the next frenzy. naturally. because he is so good at passing. and there are a few hepers living in a dome, and they are the next victims of this hunt. but they don't know it. all they know is they live in a dome that retracts in the daylight and they an go out and hunt and do whatever things they need to do. they can read, they are articulate, they know how to use weapons. and so why do they stay in the dome? do they think they are pets? i know they say they cannot get far enough awa from the dome in the daylight hours to escape, but that sounds a little suspect to me. also suspect is our boy's reaction to them. he is surprised that they are as socially advanced as they are, but he shows them no loyalty; he still sees them as \"other.\" so who is he, really? not vampire, not heper - he is just... nothing.and considering it took him five times of mentioning the lake and how thirsty he was \"but noooo the vampires cannot see me driiiink.\" before he combined those two thoughts and realized \"oh, i can drink the WATER from the LAKE!! maybe he would be better off becoming a vampire. dummy.i don' know - that whole \"hepers in a dome\" thing was weird, to me. like it was some kind of museum of natural history exhibit. they knew who ther captors were, they knew they were in danger - they knew the dome could be retracted at any time and they could be eaten, but they get a note from their ememies and they just go traipsing off into the wilderness, no questions asked? dumb.but this book wasn't the worst. there were some good scenes, and the last line aone was enough to keep me interested in where this will go.this probably needs major editing - i amon an unfamiliar computer in an unfamiliar town and everything is strange..... maybe i will revise when i get home. until then... endure..."}, {"userName": "Giselle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4800103-giselle", "userReview": "Definitely creative, but awfully bizarre to the point of being cheesy, The Hunt is perfect if you're looking for a mindless read with an interesting concept. However, if you sit for a minute and think about it, this whole plot has no justification. Why? Because there's absolutely nothing that makes me root for the humans. Why stay human? Why not simply become a vampire, and live your life amongst everyone else, free of burden. Sure you crave blood and you can't go out in the sunlight, but how does that remotely compare to being imprisoned in a human body with a constant fear of being eaten alive? Especially when the constraints are extreme and in no way convincing that any human could get away with it for as long as our protagonist did. -No smiling/laughing-No sweating-No coughing-No clearing your throat-Making sure you have no body hair at all, ever-No slouching-Having to eat raw meat-No shivering-No widening of the eyes - or any other reaction - when surprised-Having to clip your nails daily-Needing to goop up your skin to not smell human -And more, lots more.Wow! How can someone honestly be this robotic for years? Going to school every day with these people without ever showing any of these signs? Moreover, why would you want to? Living as a vampire doesn't seem bad at all. They live satisfactory lives; they're educated, they have friends, parties - a normal life, really, with the only disadvantages being the sun and craving blood (and ok, they drool a lot). I didn't buy it. This is the main reason why I couldn't enjoy this book. Everything the protagonist went through, every fear of being found out, every obstacle thrown at him, I simply didn't care as there is no convincing argument for staying human. This, to me, was a huge plot hole that I just couldn't let go throughout the whole book. It also brought on world building questions: how hard would it be to get turned without being eaten entirely? How could he make that happen? And if he can't, how did the others get turned? Were they born? Can vampires procreate (with elbow sex)? So many questions! These may have helped me understand why he's not one of them. Maybe it's not even possible; nothing is clear.I get that vampire lore has gotten to a point where you have to get very creative to make it original. But there is a line between imaginative and just plain silly. Quirks in this lore, especially armpit/elbow sex, went too far. These are way too weird to be taken seriously. The dialogue is also awkward at times with cheesy expressions. What I did like, though, was the ominous vibe from start to finish. I constantly felt like something was amiss. The gory scenes are also pretty awesome (aka: highly disgusting). And despite having a lot of similarities with the Hunger Games, in the end the plot easily stands out in its originality. The Hepers: Us, mere humans. They're all rounded up and put into a dome to get them ready for the Hunt. I found this really interesting and quite a bit frightening. Sadly though, this hunt takes a very long time to begin giving the book a fairly slow pace until the very end. I found myself simply wanting to get it over with. I wish that time would have been spent expanding the world building instead of wandering around figuring out how to stay hidden. A bigger understanding of their world, especially their knowledge of the past, would have been great way to get a better grasp on this book. In particular, why they believe Hepers are uneducated, uncivilized savages who can't speak, and are basically completely unevolved. This is especially hard when one thinking this is, in actuality, a Heper himself.Honestly, I wanted to love this. I was sure I was going to. I love dystopians and the premise is incredibly enticing, so I'm truly disappointed that it wasn't as good as I expected. I'm the type of reader who needs to be convinced. Realism is always a huge aspect for me and sadly this one had me staggering more than once. This made not only the reasoning for the plot, but the characters themselves, fall flat. I could easily see a lot of readers enjoy the alarming nature of the story; underneath it all it is interesting so don't let this discourage you if you were looking forward to it, hopefully you can have a better experience than I did.--For more of my reviews, visit my blog at Xpresso Reads"}, {"userName": "Natalie Monroe", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6688207-natalie-monroe", "userReview": "\"He's testing me. Sizing me up.\"\nFunny. That's what I was going to say about The Hunt.I don't think I've ever encountered a book that felt like such a waste of space as this one. It's mindless, meaningless stuffing. And you know what? I was enjoying it in the beginning. The writing was decent; the main character was male, a welcome change in the usual sea of female protagonists; and the concept was relatively creative: a human living among vampires as one of them. I tore through the first 18% like it was Pop Rox, thinking how ingenious the world-building was (vampires scratch their wrists in place of laughing), and how clever the MC Gene is (he purposefully vomited in a pool to distract the vampires from noticing his goosebumps).But somewhere down the line, my brain kicked in and I realized what The Hunt really is: a cliche, kiddie pool version of a dystopian.The Immortal Rules would kick its ass.The world-building is non-existent. Vampires came to power in The Immortal Rules because of a disease that turned most of humankind into vampiric zombies. The real vampires, to protect their food source, locked humans up in fortified cities in exchange for the real vampires' protection. In The Hunt, vampires rule the earth and humans are near extinct\u2014just because. There's no plausible explanation for how it got this way. And the vampires here are really stupid too. Just the scent of a herper (that's what they call humans) send them into a drooling, zombie-like feeding frenzy. How on earth did our ancestors not wipe them out using a bait-and-sunlight trap? They may be quicker, but we got brains, man.Gene is a Gary-Stu. He's not only exceptionally intelligent:\n\"Ah, yes, that yours was a stupendous and prodigious intelligence not fully tapped.\"\nHe's hot, has a sad past (his family became vampires), and has loads of girls chasing after him, even though he never so much as smiles at them. \n\"He might be a bit on the shy, quiet side,\" Ashley June continues, \"but even that's a plus: it's a quietness that's compelling and attractive. Girls love it.\"\nJeez, Gene. You sure you didn't cross genes with Bella Swan on the way to the post-apocalyptic vampire future?The plot is incredibly convenient. Buttons, safety procedures, and verbal blueprints are conveniently provided for the love interest, Ashley June and she, of course, conveniently shares her secrets with Mr. Gary Stu. There's a map inside the library where Gene is conveniently moved to because the sleeping quarters for the Herper Hunt contestants are full. A sunbeam conveniently falls on a book containing said map that directs Gene to a place I like to call Herper Wonderland, where you can drink spring water and eat well-done steaks for the rest of your human lives. It's Frozen all over again. How could the Scientist, previous owner of the library, be sure no one would move his notes? How could he be sure that a herper would somehow stumble into this room and find said map? Why does Herper Wonderland exist anyway? Use some blood and a big rock and squish those nest-stealing vampires into oblivion! What are you waiting for? The author get-go?The lovely romantic interest, Ashley June, is Teresa from The Maze Runner through and through. Gorgeous and without an ounce of personality. The book seems to fear that we'll forget how beautiful Ashley June is, so every ten pages or so, we get this:\n\"Her slender arms flow gracefully out if her gown, the gleam of silvery light along her arm like the reflection of moonlight along a river. She gathers her hair from the back and with expert sweep of one hand brushes it over her shoulder, exposing the sinuous nape of her neck.\"\nThe only thing missing from this scene is the pungent smell of blue cheese.To top it off, there's a Mysterious Person who warns Gene that Ashley June is Not All She Appears To Be. Oh, the intrigue! Oh, the subtlety! You might as well stab a red bedsheet on that page to remind readers that this is a Very Important Clue.Sadly, this Very Important Clue does not come to fruition in this installment and will possibly function as a tension point for Gene and Ashley June's relationship in the sequel. This will provide Gene an opportunity to bond with Sissy, the other corner of the predictable love triangle. Fortunately, I will not be sticking around to witness their inevitable relationship drama. Ciao, Gene."}, {"userName": "Aly (Fantasy4eva)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1491042-aly-fantasy4eva", "userReview": "I'm struggling as to whether I should give this a 2.5 or a 3. I know. What a horrible rating for a book I'm sure you expected a lot more from.It started off decent enough. The middle was quite shaky. But the last 50 pages or so just went more and more downhill.When you get down to it (to be blunt). It's a case of one dimensional characters and not that much of a well-written book. It was entertaining at points. But something would always pop up that would let me down. World building wasn't on point and nor did I feel that it was nearly explained as it should have been. We know the basics. But that's it. I didn't find it believable and I also did not feel like I was being attempted at being convinced. When the characters aren't doing it for you, you at least need to believe in the premise (especially in this genre). I found neither with this book.Our protagonist is a boy who tends to act modest, but behind that little facade of his, he truly thinks he is the shit. When it's not the most popular girl in school: Ashley June fawning over him, every other girl is. Of course it's hardly his fault that he's so good looking, charming, intelligent and brilliant. I mean, he tries so very hard to hide his brilliance, so very hard in fact that everyone sees him as the loner, good looking guy who holds back when it comes to work.I mean he tries to hide it so much that it shocks him when he realises that people have somehow noticed his amazing intelligence! *gasps* However could such a thing have happened. *cricket*You have this Heper (human) who is surrounded by these Vampire peepz. Humans are apparently now extinct. Or close to extinct anyway. When it is announced that there will be one last Hunt where the winner Hunters will be set loose to capture, kill and eat the Hepers. Everyone in the whole Institute can't wait. No seriously, they really can't. As soon as they hear the name Hepers, and god forbid, see the FACES ON SCREEN, they start to shake their heads, drool splashing everywhere, mesmerised and very, very hungry.It's not an easy life living among the predators. Every day he shoves in those fake fangs, applies ointment and hand-sanitisers all over his body( to take away all body odour so that they don't smell him), eat raw meat and follow all their rituals to basically blend in. It's very, very tough when he can't smile, laugh, run or eat the food that he enjoys. He doesn't even remember his own name, bless him. It's pretty much hell to keep up this facade every day for the rest of your life. In fact, I don't know how he manages to for as long as he does, and truthfully, I think it's pulling itself a bit of a stretch there. No way would any human be able to pull off and blend in as long as he does, no way.Oh, these are no hot vamps, guys. First off all, just ew. They sleep hanging upside-down on ceilings (like freaking bats), drool all the facking time. And I'm serious. In every page, someone is drooling(and let me tell you, it is bloody annoying). When they're not drooling you have out protagonist doing this weird mating ritual shit where he's knocking elbows with a certain someone (I mean come on, elbows, is this supposed to be sexy) when it's not the elbows, it's freaking armpits. Oh please, I thought I would die from all the cringing and elbow/armpit mating.But get this. He thinks that the Heper are savages. Pathetic, uneducated etc, etc. But somehow, he is superior. Even though you are also a Heper you facking idiot! I get that he's been brought up to blend in, to follow their rules. But his father never barred him from the truth. He was always very clear about who they were. So I don't care what his excuse is. His tendency to be utterly arrogant in comments like these pissed me off. Not to mention, when it comes down to it, he is a bit of a coward, not very interesting, oh, and a douche. I also didn't find him very interesting. Booooooooo.Also, I think Gene has a thing with arms. Maybe he finds them kinky or something. And then at one point there was this song. I read the lyrics and I think they were supposed to be pretty and beautiful, but they were kind of lame. Of course then I felt guilty for thinking they were lame. But, you know, they just really were. Lame that is.I did have higher hopes for it. I thought it would be a lot better. Instead I got a very Hunger Games -esque novel, without the awesomeness :( If I try to look at this book character wise, it still fails quite bad. I did not connect with even one, simply because there was not enough depth to them. The only character that intrigued me a bit was Ashley. And we all know what happened with that one. Eh.Did I mention the cheesy bits. Oh boy does it get cheesy. So the 'hot chick' who is in love with our protag, is in a group called 'The Desirables'. Yes guys, I kid you not. *blinks* Towards the end this cheesiness goes on to this whole other level. So much so that I had a huge urge to look away because I was so embarrassed for this poor book. It was all quite traumatising.When it wasn't the un-sexy times, it was the knocking of not very sexy elbows and armpits *winces*. Then there was hissing, scratching their elbows when they found something funny (I know, WTF'?) or the drooling that had the tendency to slobber all over our protags head, OR it was the cheesy dialogue. *flails*Too much freaking weirdness in one book. Fair enough, it's refreshing to see these different habits of these vamps, I just wish they were habits that weren't so silly. Oh,oh! I remember something! The author had a habit of repeating dialogue- which really did not make me love it more. It's all so negative. *sighs* I know. It was OK the the beginning, though. Just went downhill I'm afraid :/"}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "More questions than answers.So the concept is that Gene is a human living in a world taken over by these creatures...I'm not sure if they're vampires or some other monsters, but they act somewhat like vampires. They sleep hanging upside down (how the hell do the hidden humans fake that? That's never entirely explained), they eat flesh, not just drink blood, they don't have body hair, they don't show emotions except to scratch the inside of their wrist when they find something amusing, they don't sweat...etc.Poor Gene is trying to survive as a lone human in a world filled with monsters. In order to do this, he has to shave daily, use deodorant religiously in order NOT to stink (not an easy task, being a teenage boy and not stinking to high heavens) or sweat (again, teenage boy), try not to blink with so much emotion (an exaggeration, but not so much).Really, it's easier to just go on the freaking run. It's like the equivalent of being a black police officer going undercover in a KKK commune. IT'S A BAD IDEA.The monsters in this world are caricatures. I get the image of Count Dracula in a kitschy black & white film going \"I VAAAAAAAAANT TO SUUUUUUUUUUUCK YOUR BLOOOOOOOD.\" They start slavering and drooling at any hint of an impending meal of delicious humans (known as hepers)...they literally start drooling. Not very scary.Then there's the background. What background? How did the world come to be as it was? How did the vampire/monster hierarchy with the head master come about? How did Gene and his family manage to survive or even get to the vampire city...what about his grandparents? And the heper dome/farm?

We know from earlier in the book he's bitten and turns into a vampire himself, but commits suicide by running into the sun. We also know that the 'official' history is that humans and vampires evolved separately, vampires believing that they're more evolved and humans just a source of food. But, we also know from Gene's father's death humans can be turned into vampires, so I'm thinking the 'official' history is just a sham, maybe a large portion of the current vampire population came from vampires who were once human, until vampire numbers reached a critical mass, they took over the city, and with the dwindling human population they just started eating the rest. Now, I'm convinced the Director doesn't know anything else, but the Ruler must. It's suggested he's keeping more human prisoners in pens beneath his palace (for himself, there aren't enough left for the Hunt, even though he needs it to maintain his popularity), and even a generation back humans were more sophisticated than the few now, Sissy's father taught her how to read and write and Gene's father kept a huge amount of myths and stuff in his journal, so the Ruler has to know something else. His suspicious behavior indicates as much. Finally, Gene's father, who has a secret map that vampires cannot read, wasn't instantly killed and eaten when vampires discovered he's human, but instead turned, which clearly takes a great deal of self control on the vampire's part. All this suggests there's a population of human refugees somewhere that the Ruler wants to get to so he can stage more hunts, and he's using Gene to find it after his father fails.

I couldn\u2019t help but draw comparisons with THE IMMORTAL RULES and this month\u2019s DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN. I haven\u2019t read DARKNESS BEFORE DAWN yet, but this book\u2019s quality of writing was leaps and bounds better than THE IMMORTAL RULES. It\u2019s literary without being over the top, as can be an issue sometimes, especially in young adult fiction.This book is really bizarre. If you\u2019re not a bizarre, hang up the phone right now because this book will not be for you. Check out Giselle from Xpresso Reads\u2019 review for her take from the viewpoint of the \u201cthis book was too bizarre\u201d person. But if you like bizarre, hang with me. Gene is a very interesting narrator. This guy lost his family at a young age and was forced to adapt to survive \u2013 no sweating, no laughing, no squinting, etc. The story is told in first person present tense from his point of view, and although he\u2019s not the easiest character to connect with, his narration whips the story forward at a very nice pace.The cast of side characters that are fleshed out and named are very small. In fact, it\u2019s pretty much limited to the love interest Ashley June and the young Hepers they\u2019re chosen to hunt. Names are apparently not big in Weird Vampire Critter lore, as is mentioned by Gene at one point in the story. Even the kids are not fully explored, besides leader Sissy and requisite skeptic Epap. The other hunters and denizens of the Institute aren\u2019t named or analyzed other than appearances and skills. I wish we had known more, especially once twist one becomes apparent.But I should probably skip to the chase. There was one big problem I had with this story that automatically took off a point from my final rating. The world building, or as I would like to call it, \u201cWhat the frell?\u201d, was pretty much non-existent when it came to matters of explanations and world set up. Yes, we know what the world is in their present, but how did it come to be? Horse-drawn carriages, vampires, cheetahs\u2026 If Fukuda had taken the time to explain the world, how it came to be, how all the humans died and vampires evolved over several thousand years to become the dominant species, it would have worked better. And the explanations about humans being more closely related to fish was strange.But apparently you can be turned into a vampire? I think I might have misread that part.Oh, and my other problem? Ashley June. Her obsession with Gene was really, really creepy at times. I mean, at one point we learn that she stood outside his house and stared at the door waiting for him. Um\u2026 No, thank you.I forgot about the elbow sex. ELBOW SEX. You shove your elbow into an armpit and it\u2019s the ultimate orgasm. That was just really, really creepy. Juxtaposed with extremely graphic scenes about gooey flesh, sunburns, hepers being hunted and killed\u2026 I did mention this book will not be for everyone, right?Ultimately, this book has one major flaw that spoiled my massive enjoyment. Another twenty pages to actually explain what the hell this world was about would have done this book WONDERS and it would have been five glowing stars dancing the salsa with Karl Urban in space. But instead, it fell a little short of that \u2013 more like a Channing Tatum in a seedy male strip club.VERDICT: Belayed by its rather nonsensical and lacking world building, THE HUNT was well written, unique, and action-packed. But that world building\u2026 Eeeeeep."}, {"userName": "hayden", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2995566-hayden", "userReview": "There was only one word on my mind when I closed the back cover of The Hunt: wow!The gobsmacking cover drew me in, and Fukuda's carefully chosen words kept me held close. Fukuda really knows how to make a book page-turning. Every word Fukuda writes is important and engrossing; not once is there an infodump, which makes for an action-packed and gripping read. I read this book in three hours bcause it was just so tense and wonderful. The concept of The Hunt is intriguing: humans have been replaced by a new generation of creatures that crave human blood, yet are surprisingly not vampire-like, and our protagonist is a regular human. Said regular humans are called hepers. Our main character, Gene, has to monitor his every move so he doesn't end up being eaten by the Human 2.0's.The novel also presents many themes, which include family, friendship, and staying true to yourself. Fukuda manages to include these themes without sounding preachy, and he does it well. Including these things in a novel makes it feel more realistic, and I felt like I was right there next to Gene as he was experiencing everything. I will admit that I thought The Hunt was a Hunger Games knockoff at first. And for a few pages, it seemed like it. The concept: going into a big arena to fight off as many as you can and be the winner? Dystopian society? As soon as I made the comparison, I lost all hope for the book. Just another author capitalizing off the success of the dystopian genre. As I began the novel, though, I was captivated, and I lost all suspicions I had once had. I realized soon enough that there was one key difference from The Hunger Games: the initiation. In Hunger Games, it lasted a very meager number of pages. In The Hunt, there is a much longer period of time where the Hunters are initiated. At this point, I was able to stop worrying about its copycat nature and just enjoy it.The Hunt also features a little bit of romance -- between Gene and a certain unnamed non-Heper girl. I won't give anything away, but one of the things Gene's dad told him before he disappeared was to never fall in love with one of the non-Hepers. Let's just kick back and wait to see how deep Gene falls into trouble...Speaking of Gene, Fukuda characterizes very well. The backstory he provides for each of the characters makes them feel like family to the reader. It is very special. You don't see that a lot in YA; most characters are just there to follow the plot and provide entertainment in other YA. I can almost hear the conversation:\n\"Why do you love me, Edward?\"\n\"Because Stephenie Meyer told me to. Oh, and also, spoiler alert: you'll eventually become a vampire.\"\n\"Oh YAY! I love you, too!\"\nThis is not the case in The Hunt. Each character is fleshed out thoroughly, emotional, non-cardboard-like in nature. I appreciate that.If you're looking for a kick-arse, addictive and genuinely real novel, try The Hunt. Andrew Fukuda is a debut author not to be missed."}, {"userName": "Donna {Book Passion for Life}", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3024878-donna-book-passion-for-life", "userReview": "I\u2019m honestly not sure where to start with this review, because The Hunt was one of those books that once I started, I couldn't stop reading, but overall I really didn\u2019t enjoy it. While the book is suppose to be on par with The Hunger Games, I would have to disagree. The storyline does have similar traits but the only thing I felt the author did the same, was create the same back story without that wow factor The Hunger Games leaves you with. Fukuda has definitely created something very unique with the vampire\u2019s, which is something fresh, new and well \u2013 very freaky. But for the most part I was really creeped out by them. They have unique and weird habits that really left me a bit disturbed. They scratch their wrists instead of laughing, have drool constantly dripping from their mouths, and have armpit/elbow sex (which I can\u2019t even figure out how that works? LOL) and that\u2019s only a few things that made me cringe. But while you\u2019re probably thinking these things really aren\u2019t that bad, for me they are because there the first of many other problems I have with this book. The second thing is I felt the story wasn\u2019t explained enough. You\u2019re thrown into Gene\u2019s life and watch how he has to struggle being apart of this world and pretending to be a vampire but there isn\u2019t a why. Why would he want to pretend and constantly watch his back? Why would he want to become friends with them? And why would he have feelings for one of them that could, at anytime, rip his throat out? It didn\u2019t make sense to me. I really didn\u2019t connect with Gene. This is because the story is told from his point of view and I never really connect with male characters as much as females, and while I thought Gene is a good character to look up to, I just don\u2019t understand his reasoning for the things he does. If that was me, I would have given up a long, long time ago, but that\u2019s not it \u2013 there are other questions popping up from the story like, how do the vampires procreate? How do the vampires not notice that Gene is human, if they have intense supernatural senses? I could go on and on because I felt like there were too many flaws in the plot and I really couldn\u2019t overlook them. Maybe I'm over thinking the story to much but there were just to many loose ends for me to enjoy this book.Overall, The Hunt didn\u2019t wow me, but I can see why so many people liked it so even though it\u2019s not for me, give this book a try and see what you think for yourself."}, {"userName": "Kristy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2705039-kristy", "userReview": "Wow, this was such an interesting idea. Such a cool concept. Let me give you an inside look:So in this world, humans or hepers are the minority. They are basically extinct. The world consists of these vampire-ish creatures.They are not your typical Vampire diaries/Twilight vamps. They are not romantic. In order for you, as a human to survive as our main character Gene does, you must blend in. You must look and smell like a vampire. This means, shaving all your hair, never showing an emotion on your face, never getting goosebumps, wearing fake fangs, deodorizing yourself, etc. This is crucial to survival. Standing out in the wrong way is death. In this sick world, the rulers have decided it's time for a hunt, they will choose at random (probably not) individuals to participate in this. These \"lucky\" ones will get to hunt down the last of the remaining Hepers. It's sort of a last man standing ordeal. It's everyone out for themselves, bloodlust at it's most intense and time to attack.Gene is chosen and so is another girl from his school, Ashley. He drools over her, but knows he cannot have her. He wants things to be different. But, he is alone. Will he survive? How can he hide his essence amoung all these vamps (or whatever they are)? Can he escape? 3 starsWarning; this book is weird, just flat out weird. If you can tolerate the scratching elbows and hissing in the beginning I would say give it a good go. This one is not going to be for everyone, most definitely not for those not into dystopian and not for those who are going to nit-pick every detail. If you can let yourself escape into this world, it's actually quite good... but I can't guarantee that you will be able to...(maybe that made sense)Also, that ending!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wow, I am hooked. Now, I really want to know what happens next, but I will say I could see myself getting bored with this cat and mouse game if something insane doesn't happen next!Crystal, my BBP... so far our \"bad books\" haven't been to horrible. I'm glad I read this one. It's going to stay with me ;)Edit: after completing this series, I would like to ward anyone off from getting any further into this hot mess! Geeze.

I liked it's originality, the eerie setting, graphic-paint-a-horrific-picture wring style and the humans that standout in a world I would not want to live in.Fresh and Intriguing from start to finish, this is one book that really surprised me and I'm glad I took a chance on it.

Gene is many things: A survivor, an expert at deception, but most of all a freak. Instead of fangs, he has unsharpened incisors. While the sun makes 'people' melt and disintegrate, Gene can withstand ceaseless daylight. Instead of a healthy diet of blood and raw meat, Gene needs water and fruit to survive. Gene is a freak. A heper. A human. And if people knew what he was, he would be something else entirely: dead in seconds.For seventeen years Gene has evaded detection by following the rules: don\u2019t blink, don't sneeze, don\u2019t cough, laugh or smile, and he's done well. But then The Ruler announces something extraordinary: a Heper Hunt, the first in ten years. Chosen by lottery to be one of the 'lucky' hunters\u2014one the last to ever taste extremely endangered heper flesh\u2014Gene must use all his tricks to survive. Cut off from proper food, water and deodorant, the other hunters are beginning to smell something... Well, not fishy. Something far, far more delicious...My Thoughts:Fukuda\u2019s \u2018People\u2019\u2014for people is what they are in this world, and you will not see them referred to otherwise\u2014are not quite vampires. More like the unholy love child of a vampire/zombie/human union: they think, they reason, they can, in fact, reproduce, and live normal, healthy lives. They are, in many ways, just like you and me, but they crave human flesh with unbridled hunger. They possess no control, and they have no internal struggle or moral quandaries to romanticise. These people would like nothing less than to tear your arms from your sockets and slurp your brain up like soup. Yet they are not so different. They have families, schools, parties and children. Teens have boyfriends and girlfriends. Friends share jokes. It\u2019s amongst these \u2018people\u2019 that we find Gene, and start to question what, exactly, \u2018human\u2019 means.Gene is a fascinating character study, a walking, talking, dichotomy\u2014a lesson in Doublethink. He lives by careful rules: don't be caught out by the monsters, remember who you are\u2014human\u2014different from the monsters, better, all while, in some dark, secret place, longing to be a 'real' person, himself.Gene\u2019s humanity is an interesting thing. More than desire, longing, desperation, one thing has been deeply ingrained into the fibre of his very being: survive. At any cost\u2014any length\u2014survive. This need to survive can manifest itself in very ugly ways. If a human is willing to sacrifice anything and anyone for his own survival, what does that say about his humanity? Has he lost what it means to be human, or is it that need to survive, that tenacity and determination to cling to life despite the most desperate of circumstance, what makes him\u2014and us\u2014human, instead?So The Hunt poses an interesting question: what is \u2018human\u2019? People mercilessly hunt hepers. They are cold, calculating, cruel; but is this any different from shark and seal, or lion and antelope? Is it different from humans and the billions of cattle, chickens, and sheep slaughtered each year to feed \u2018humans\u2019? So Fukuda asks us this: are People as bad as they sound, or just the top of the food chain? Is Gene himself any better? He leaves it to the reader to decide, and therein lies his brilliance. Fukuda's characters\u2014even his heroes and heroines\u2014are not always likeable, or easy to connect with, but it seems to be the point. They are flawed, at times ugly, but always interesting.A steady, calculated creepiness and menace hang over The Hunt, and every page is coloured with a heavy sense of desperation. There are bigger games at play, and while the players have yet to reveal themselves, it becomes very clear Gene is a pawn. But this is where the comparisons to Chess or Checkers must stop. The Hunt is not a book of black and white, or perhaps even varying shades of grey. It\u2019s a thick, muddy quagmire filled with hidden traps and dangers.When Fukuda writes action, he holds nothing back. In contrast to Gene's carefully practiced facade, and the lingering sense of dread and foreboding that shrouds every word of The Hunt, every moment of flight, every fight, every suspicious glance ratchets up the tension and flies along at breakneck pace. Sharp and vivid, Fukuda writes with an emotive brilliance. The kind that will leave your throat parched and aching with Gene\u2019s thirst, longing for rest, and scratching your wrist in laughter\u2014oh, wait... you don\u2019t have a funny bone there, either?The Verdict:Dark, tense and brilliant, Fukuda\u2019s debut is not to be missed. Flawlessly combining chilling creepiness with nail biting tension and action, The Hunt is The Hunger Games, with the focus on the game\u2014the mind game that is: The manoeuvering, the politics, the conspiracy, unravelling alliances and secrets. While not quite as action-packed as the name might suggest, The Hunt moves at electrifying pace, and will deliver thrills and chills to boys and girls (grown up ones, too) alike.Originally posted at saz101 \u00bb"}, {"userName": "Patricia Crowther", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31420367-patricia-crowther", "userReview": "3.5* - it was weird at times but there was also something quite addictive about it too."}, {"userName": "Danny", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3254909-danny", "userReview": "Review first posted at Bewitched Bookworms\nLet me preface by telling you that I started this book with no real expectations. The synopsis sounded intriguing enough, the cover looks great and I thought I was up for a great read. I had no idea what I was getting into and I ended up having one of the most amazing and thrilling rides with this book\u2026 Be aware! It\u2019s getting\u2026 Dark!Hello Cruel and Horrible World (..of which I do not wish to be part of \u2026 )*shivers* Humans are nearly extinct. Our world is ruled by some blood and flesh-eating monsters for which we are a delicacy. Ieek! They are a mix of Zombies and Vampires, which I found was a very unique mix! There isn\u2019t much that is human about them anymore which makes it even harder for the reader to comprehend this new world. But at the same time, it was utterly darkly thrilling and fascinating\u2026 They have different gestures and habits, which seems extremely foreign and alien for us! Sometimes even to the point of disgusting. But, this you have to explore yourself while reading, just \u2026 be warned!Although there are nearly no humans anymore, those that survived have to hide between those monsters. They have to make them all believe they are one of them and if you slip once\u2026 well, you are the next lunch!Gene! Yes, we get a Boy\u2019s POV and he\u2019s awesome!Gene is one of those humans that hide between these monsters and his father trained him well. He knows exactly how to survive and how to not attract attention! He\u2019s smart, but he tries to hide his intellect at school. He\u2019s a loner, but what other choice does he has among kids who would love nothing more than to eat him! Gene has a smart and great voice and I loved to listen and follow his journey of survival. His needs to be even smarter and sharper when he drew one of the lucky numbers that got him invited to join The Hunt \u2013 which is .. a hunt for humans! Suddenly everything is at stake!Gene was in constant struggle to survive and to hide. At the same time, he had to be careful not to lose his humanity since he is utterly alone among those beings\u2026 After he lost his father he had no one to remind him what he truly is!Twisted, Dark, Thrilling and Disturbingly Fascinating!This story was a ride like nothing else I\u2019ve read before. It was so dark and I was constantly on edge and afraid for Gene to be discovered. And although I was disgusted by these monsters, at the same time there was no way to put this book down, no way for me not to know how this story goes on. There wasn\u2019t a dull moment in this book, there wasn\u2019t a moment where you could let you guard down, the plot was constantly and mercilessly moving forward! There was one moment in the middle where I was ready for a break, where the plot slowed down a little, but the author was incredible smart and threw in a twist that made me gasp and forgotten was the pause I intended to have\u2026 Actually, there were a lot of surprises I didn\u2019t see coming which made the story just more gripping for me! I love to be surprised in a good, but also in a bad way!The was a little romance in the book, but it didn\u2019t dominate the story and it didn\u2019t dictate Gene\u2019s actions completely. He stayed true to himself and his survival instinct always won the battle! It felt real and honest!Bottom LineThe Hunt by Andrew Fukuda is utterly disturbing, dark, twisted and gross, but incredibly fascinating at the same time. Gene was a smart and sharp hero I loved to follow, he\u2019s one of those perfect examples why Boy POV\u2019s rock! The ending was incredible with a cliffhanger that will leave you hanging and wanting more - right now! If you are up for a thrilling ride then go and get The Hunt!"}, {"userName": "Addie", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4735719-addie", "userReview": "If I\u2019m already hating the main character by page 4, there\u2019s obviously a problem. I honestly can\u2019t believe how many 4 and 5 star reviews this book has gotten. Really, guys? Really?I\u2019m honestly not sure what to say about this book. Writing negative reviews is always difficult. Effusing about something you loved? Easy like Sunday morning. Slamming a debut author\u2019s laborious efforts of creation? It hurts my soul a little. I\u2019ll start off with things I liked about The Hunt. Fukuda makes an attempt to be original in his vampiric creations - and they\u2019re actually really gross, the way vampires (to my mind) ought to be. The writing is capable. The book is mercifully short.Unfortunately, I liked very little else about the book. Fukuda \u201cmakes an attempt\u201d at originality - that\u2019s what I wrote, because while he attempted it, I\u2019m not sure he succeeded. His vampires scratch their wrists in lieu of laughter, and rub their elbows and armpits together instead of making out. I\u2019m not a scientist, but I happen to know that behaviours like laughter and kissing have an actual biological purpose - group bonding, etc. There is NO conceivable reason why your wrists should itch when something\u2019s funny, or why your armpit should be an erogenous zone. None. It came across as a poorly-cobbled-together attempt to seem \u201cdifferent\u201d without putting any thought into why. It was all so\u2026 ridiculous.The main character, Gene, can only be described as insufferable. By the end of the first chapter, he\u2019s assured us that he\u2019s the smartest, most attractive person alive - multiple times. He actually says something to the effect that \u201cit sucks to be sooo hot, because so many women will be all over me, and that\u2019ll make it hard to keep my cover as a human.\u201d Shoot me. Arrogance is a viable personality trait - but only when the author actually recognizes that a character is arrogant. Gene is amazingly arrogant, but Fukuda seems to think he\u2019s just telling it like it is. No. Sorry. Your character\u2019s a huge jerk. And, as his horrible choices prove over and over and over until you want to kill yourself, definitely Too Stupid To Live.The plot, while not quite as poorly constructed as the world, seems like a huge stretch. It\u2019s essentially a set-up for Fukuda to stage some Hunger Games style competition, but with vampires. And for most of the book, nothing happens. A major plot twist regarding Ashley June, who is Gary Stu\u2019s main love interest, was visible from about a league away. And it\u2026 fell flat. I have to actually care about the character if I\u2019m going to care about the plot and I just\u2026 didn\u2019t. The writing? Literally painful. Boomerang isn\u2019t a verb - if I\u2019d been taking notes, I\u2019d have a million more examples of things like that. The slang was forced. And pulsing with the pulse of blood? Or a falling icicle of black ice? Icicles are ice. Pulses pulse. Shoot me, somebody, please. It was so awful at points that, most of the time, I couldn\u2019t even bring myself to care.I could probably go on, but I\u2019ve decided not to. A lot of other reviewers have given this four- and five-star ratings - and people have different tastes. You know. However, my personal opinion is that this book is a serious pass. I want a refund on my time.Rating: 1/5 starsThanks due to the publisher and to Netgalley for providing a digital copy of the book."}, {"userName": "Rebecca McNutt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36977686-rebecca-mcnutt", "userReview": "The Hunt surprised me; usually I'm really not a big fan of vampire books, but this one doesn't focus much on vampires.

The recruitment of participants was a lottery game and guess who won ?Ofcourse our dear hero , Gene .Now not only is he going to be hunting a heper but will be trying to save his own heper butt .So like it goes Always ...You go to a game , you try to save yourself and find love in the most hopeless place .So now let's get down to how i found the book .Gene was a very annoying character . i mean annoying beyond imagination . okay i get it ! he lives among the vampires and finds THEM civilised even with their drooling and lots of blood trickling down their chin when they eat while he finds hepers savages . then he complains of how crappy his life and how much he just adores vamps and wants to be like them and how he likes this Vampire chick , Ashley June and how in the whole world he does everything to save himself by applying ointments , shaving of body hair , joining the vampire spitting fest AND......wait for it ....scratching wrists .( i'll get back on the scratching thing real soon .)the thing is , Mr. Gene if you love vampires so much why don't you just change ?i mean you could get all down and dirty with Ashley June by grinding elbows into each others armpits and fall in love and then do the twilight-thing and just make her change you ? i mean obviously you should because you already eat meat .and he calls himself brilliant . *snorts*leaving him , there is not one character in the book to which i could actually learn something from . like what's the deal dude ? how come Vamps wipe humans off ? a little bit more detail and it would've been perfecto .then the scratching wrists .You find something funny , you scratch . trying Sarcasm , you scratch . are a bit pissed , you scratch . seriously ?! aren't you vampires supposed to have LONG Nails which really make your skin go this ugly shade of red when you keep on scratching ?!and top it all you guys spit like you're marking territory like dogs ! ( tsk .. tsk ...very CIVILIZED of them )Sooo...you guys like playing with Arms and drool in your private moments ? i mean of course you can't kiss ! you have fangs to deal with . and so yes the possible best alternative are grinding elbows into each others armpits . obviously , you must be very clean .then coming to the mid-section and where you meet these other participants ..So basically they are vampire-robots .no name . designations like H-6 and D-4 and etc .typically brainless and yes again , they drool .all the while i was waiting for some action which didn't really happen .( and if you call gross things 'action' . sorry bud , you're a bit confused)i think i'm starting to miss the sparkling couple of twilight . o.OA LOT .then it came down to what the hunt is about . HEPERS . the one's you're supposed to hunt .i think they are the only characters i loved along with Ashley June who turns out to be surprisingly awesome .now follows the end . i will agree that signs of adrenaline were definitely starting to show . i was a bit bored if i might be honest ...because what are you supposed to do when you see the same kind of people , doing the exact same thing in every freaking dystopia ! i will ban dystopia for life if authors don't find something original -.-then bumped in the cliffhanger .I kinda LOVED it .maybe because of all the old-school things when something lightening came up i was kind of surprised and finally satisfied . (a bit)Though yes , this book remains a total letdown ."}, {"userName": "Isamlq", "userReviewDate": "Feb 29, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4016030-isamlq", "userReview": "[ I don\u2019t know but Ashley June as just another heper, was too darned easy!

Andrew Fukuda has definitely given us a vampire version hunger game with these blood-sucking, flesh-eating vampires. The Hunt is eerie, weird (good weird) and one of the creepiest novels I have ever read. Fukuda has created an unusually weird way of kissing and laughing when it comes to these vampires, it definitely freaks me out. The Hunt is an awesome novel and Fukuda has packed it to the max with action, and I love action. Gene is another reason I love The Hunt. Gene is a beautiful character, I love that The Hunt is told from a guy's POV seeing Gene's feelings really made this story for me. As you can see from all the \"loves\" in this review, I really enjoyed The Hunt. Andrew Fukuda has written an awesome, creepy story, and these vampires will definitely not have you gushing over them.Gene is a human pretending to be a vampire in this vampire world, and he's done a good job at keeping himself alive until he's chosen to be one of the few vampires for The Heper Hunt, it becomes almost impossible for him to hide his human identity and not become the main dinner course. This heper hunt has it upside. For the first time since his family died, Gene will meet humans (Hepers) that haven't lived among vampires. Gene will see humans aren't the stupid animals that he been taught his whole life that are just raised to be food for vampires. Gene will finally get closer to the girl he has been crushing on since middle school, but never would take Ashley June up on any of her advances for fear that she would find out he's human and become her lunch. Fukuda surprised me with Ashley\u2019s character, but I'm still not sure I have figured her out. There are still some things that hasn\u2019t been answered, and I will have wait until the next book to see if I'm right. Ah, love the mystery!The Hunt is a freakishly awesome, action-packed novel with these fiendish vampires. It definitely rid me of the image of the Twilight vampires. I recommend The Hunt as a must read."}, {"userName": "Claire", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/165172-claire", "userReview": "Ok, I give this book credit for its interesting premise -- humans extinct/turned into farm commodities, vampire society ascendant, remaining humans attempting to pass in vampire society -- and the degree to which the vampires are alien, complete with odd physical tics and social norms. However, and maybe I'm overthinking things, but it's hard not to be pulled out of the book world by a few logistical issues, such as,1. If vampires' main erogenous organs are their elbows and armpits, how do they make little vampire babies? Cause there's a vampire kindergarten class, so there has to be an aging process, ergo birth, ergo... can someone just explain to me how this works, please?2. If vampires do not drink water to the point where Gene is dying of dehydration a few days into this weird vampire Hunger Games thing that Fukuda has set up, why is it that vampires pee? Yes, there is a vampires peeing in a urinal scene in this book. I did not come up with this question in a vacuum.3. If vampires don't have hair on their face or arms, why do they have hair on their heads?4. If vampires can track humans miles in the wilderness by BO alone, how exactly is Gene not discovered within the 1st 24 hours of his forced move to a place without his super secret scent-masking kit, a place where he can't even shower? I know he keeps misdirecting and complaining about the windows letting in the human scent from the humans imprisoned next door, but even if his fellow hunters don't catch on, you'd think the people who've lived in this compound next to the humans for years would figure out that something new is going on.5. Um, did I mention the armpit/elbow sex?6. And in conclusion, wtf?If you're into vampire stuff, this adds some genuinely new ideas to the genre. But if you are not a fan of the vampire craze, go ahead and miss this. Unless you like weird. Cause this definitely delivers the weird."}, {"userName": "Djezelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4155459-djezelle", "userReview":

Heroes of Olympus series, I needed to take a break from reading. And I did. For two whole days. But I was getting restless and itching for more books, so I took a couple of my friends' suggestions and picked up The Hunt, which has been sitting in my shelf for a while. I realize now that this wasn't the kind of book that I was looking to read in that moment. After reading the HoO series, I needed a calmer, more easy read- a sort of palate cleanser after a rich meal, if you will. And I did NOT get that with the Hunt. The Hunt is one of the most tense, exciting, nail-biting reads that I have discovered this year. There is really not a moment of relief- it is one of those books where you have to be on guard at all times. The plot is great- continuous action and suspense, and twists at every corner. The suspense and the thrill of every page makes you want to keep reading, and makes the book very hard to put down. Gene, our main character, is a human among vampires, and has to take every precaution possible to remain undetected. He figures out that this is near impossible. I started this book at around 9:30 AM, and, with a few breaks in between, finished at around 2:00PM. I'm not a fast reader at all, so this is saying something. (It also helps that this book is less than 300 pages long.) Anyway, this book had me from the start and never let me go. The characters for the most part were done well, although I don't think it was the book's major strength. The main character, Gene, is a 17 year old guy (who admits he's good looking, which I was a little iffy about) and he's very relatable. (Side note- relatable isn't a word on Goodreads?!) Even with the terrible cover depicting his (supposed) face, I was able to picture him easily- think Colin Ford with a bit of a tan. I thought he was very well developed for the most part- loving, smart, quick on his feet, and strong. The only problem I had with him was that he visited the humans inside the Dome, saw how innocent and mistreated they were, and yet still was totally ok with killing them for himself. Well, himself and his girlfriend, Ashley June. Ashley June was an enigma- throughout the novel I wasn't sure what to think of her. I liked her at the beginning, then decided I hated her, and then I liked her again. The only reason this happened was because there were a lot of questions surrounding who she was, and what her motives were. This was done very well by Fukuda. I thought her relationship with Gene was sweet, but it happened a little too quickly for my liking. What transpired with her at the end, however, was very touching. Sissy is a very strong tough character, and there was one time during the book when I shipped Sissy and Gene. (This was during my hate phase with Ashley June) That feeling disappeared, as I developed a liking to Gene + Ashley June , but the complicated thing is that Sissy and Gene are the two who happen to be together (physically, not emotionally) at the end of the book. It will be interesting to see how this affects whatever Gene has with Ashley June. I thought the writing was good in that the writer did a good job describing Gene's thoughts and feelings. It was very realistic and very raw. I thought the writing was sometimes a bit over-formal for a 17 year old narrator, and used words that, well, 17 year olds don't use. The setting was very cool- I try to stay away from vampires but this book was well done. I found the contrast between regular vampires and hepers (humans) very interesting. The *let's eat the humans!!!* scenes were done very well- detailed, vivid, and disgusting. Which is what it's all about. Overall, The Hunt was a very enjoyable book that was very exciting, thrilling, and suspenseful. People looking for a tense and scary read should be sure to check this one out. The Hunt is strongly recommended for fans of dystopia, vampires, and horror. I will be looking for the next book as soon as I can."}, {"userName": "Josu Grilli", "userReviewDate": "Aug 07, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4322616-josu-grilli", "userReview": "Se merece un cinco por originalidad y estilo, por carisma en los personajes y por cientos de cosas m\u00e1s, pero hay algo m\u00ednimo que evita que le ponga esa nota.
