Why were there such good reviews of this book? Why did a trio of amazing Anns (Ann Patchett, Jayne Anne Phillips, Bobbie Ann Mason) give it such glowing blurbs? This is the story of Mary Byrd Thornton, a wife and mother of two, and the week she has in 1996. She interacts with her gay best friend, she contemplates an affair, she goes to a funeral, she trash talks with her neighbors, she goes on a road trip in a semi. And she does it all in a totally down-homey Southern folksiness. Had this been the description of the book, I would not have read it. Instead reviews and publicity bill the book as the story of what happened to Mary Byrd's stepbrother, who was molested and murdered about thirty years earlier, much as the author's young brother was. I had envisioned some sort of gripping family story combined with a mystery. I was wrong, but mostly I was wrong because publishers wanted me to believe that's what it was. It worked, but they haven't left me a happy reader. I am by no means opposed to novels where there are no long-ago murders and where there are no killers to be brought to justice (most novels, in other words), but the combination of how this was sold and the fact that the murder actually plays a relatively small role -- but a weird role nevertheless -- just did not work for me. Also: there is no way that child predators were stalking young boys and sending child pornography via the internet -- in 1987 (as the novel claims). I did not even have EMAIL till 1993."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/113324-robin", "userReview": "Disclaimer: I won this in a first reads giveaway.Well, this book was not for me.The writing was ok mostly, with bouts of goodness. The dialogue was usually annoying or unrealistic (do people in Mississippi talk like this book? I doubt it). At first, I thought the plot was going to be the driving force, but the book quickly took a left turn into character development. I disliked basically all of the characters in the book, which didn't help.Weirdly the big plot climax was very anticlimactic and not much discussion or meaning was added to it. The only meaning attached to the plot/characters was wrapped into the final few scenes in a clumsy way.But the most annoying thing for me was the seeming respect given to characters which were blatantly racist or sexist or homophobic (or all three). If you're going to force me to read about fictional bigots I expect there to be a point to what I'm reading, either you turn those people into satires, or you point out how dumb that is, or something. But just to be like \"oh, isn't this racist sexist moron truck driver so romantically southern!\" um no he's not. Irritating. Its not that I object to realistic depictions of racism/sexism, but when the characters in the book are like admiring someone for \"being themselves\" because they're racist/sexist, I object to that.

I\u2019m laughing and having a good time with some of the other reviewers: some of us didn\u2019t know quite what to expect. The book\u2019s description speaks of an old child molestation and murder case: something dark that needs to be solved. But\u2026then. We hear how Kroger\u2019s has better produce; an Acid Reflux Pillow sells for $59.99. We hear about the family: everything about how they keep their rooms to the secrets they keep. We hear about the neighbors, and the people down the block, and the people across town. It\u2019s lovely.So yes, this book is not for everyone. There are several characters involved here. Each of them are unique and whacky; each of them totally believable. The quality of writing from Lisa Howarth (of Square Books, Oxford, MS fame) ties it all together wonderfully. One after another: metaphors, analogies, and even some hyperbole. It\u2019s all personable, fun, and\u2014again\u2014lovely.I think you get the picture. This is a tribute to who we are. Whether the community is a small town in the Midwest (such as where I grew up), a group of book bloggers and reviewers, friends on Facebook, co-workers\u2014anything\u2014there\u2019s always something going on and something to get into. We all bring something special to the table. In the end, the big issues may not get solved, but we\u2019ve got plenty else to consume our time and talents with.So, don\u2019t read this for the mystery or thrills. Just come on down and visit for a while. You\u2019ll enjoy the zany individual stories and interconnectedness of it all.

It has a beginning of sorts, but then the entire book is taken up by asides and stream in consciousness of various characters. Nothing moves the \"plot\" forward; in fact, there really isn't a real plot, only two short passages where the main character receives a telephone call in the beginning and has a family meeting near the end. I am amazed that some people said that meandering around without moving the plot (such as it is) forward is the hallmark of a great southern novel; I have loved many southern novels and none are as annoyingly devoid of plot as this one. I agree with Maureen's review, although she generously gave it two stars: \"The plot meanders around, showing glimpses of her family life, a bit of her extracurricular activities, a little glance at race, but never pulls together into a storyline for me.

Maybe it\u2019s my fondness for quirky, wonderfully flawed, and loveable characters that are thick in Southern Fiction, as is in this novel. The protagonist, Mary Bird, aka M\u2019Bird, is a loving mother, understanding wife, and devoted friend. She\u2019s from Italian decent, and her black housekeeper, Evagreen, has issues with her because she\u2019s not \u201cwhite\u201d enough. Mary Bird\u2019s best friend is a gay man, and she\u2019s deeply devoted to the town homeless Veteran (who happens to be black). She indiscriminately flirts with the town smarmy single guy. And she LOVES Southern history. Lisa Howorth uses \u201cmarginal types\u201d in this novel to provide entertainment and to show how important those characters are in small southern towns.It\u2019s a witty novel, that boarders on irreverent. There\u2019s a discussion in the novel about which states are \u201cauthentic southern states.\u201d I learned that Mississippi is, of course(the novel takes place there), but Virginia is a Yankee state. Mary Bird takes a ride with a trucker to visit her Mother, and that trip it a hoot.What makes this novel so great, is that while it can be facetious at times, the main story line is very serious. Mary Bird\u2019s brother was sexually abused and murdered thirty years ago. The crime was never solved. A cold case detective looks into it, and the family finds that there was some major bungling in handling the case. This event is deeply moving and heartbreaking. Howorth can write with compassion. The reader feels the grief of the family and the complicated emotions involved with family trauma. The housekeeper, Evagreen, has a complicated trauma in her family as well. This book is rich with southern history. It\u2019s entertaining and fun. Yet, there are dark and complicated themes that people from all walks of life can identify with. It\u2019s a great work."}, {"userName": "Karla Eaton", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17926213-karla-eaton", "userReview": "While I realize the beauty of this author's writing, this is not my cup of tea.Firstly, I cannot stand the woman who is the main focus - Mary Byrd. She is exactly the kind of person I avoid - an unmade bed who makes no attempt to get her S**& in order. She even takes pride in her woebegone ways - leaving the cat with \"amazon butt\" because she doesn't grab it and clean its fur, being irrationally terrified of flying so instead she hitches a ride with a chicken farmer from Mississippi to Richmond, Virginia, dallying with an extra-marital affair and making excused for her ridiculous behavior - yuck.Secondly, this novel aggrandizes the boozy, aristocratic south. It embraces the landed-gentry, frat boy culture which nauseates me. While these people can drop a vocabulary word as if they are sophisticated and educated - Mary Byrd's husband is even an art dealer who is wooing a drunken and rude photographer - they embrace that \" don't know and don't care\" kind of culture. Mary Byrd befriends every woebegone bedraggled mutt of a human because she is one herself.The story line is interesting because it shows the commonality between cultures - her black maid who is far more competent than she is -- and why does she need a maid to help with the house and kids when she doesn't work is beyond me - has the same tragedies - love and loss. In her misery - far more severe and recent - she can still find time to show an intense kindness and empathy with Mary Byrd, but Mary Byrd can't get herself together even to the end of the novel to reciprocate in kind. I just cannot get over the narcissism and excuse making of the main character to really like the writer's tale, even though I appreciate the central story and the effort she makes to show the timelessness of man's plight which transcends date stamp, gender, race, and income."}, {"userName": "Felicity Gibson", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21292589-felicity-gibson", "userReview": "Flying Shoes by Lisa Howarth.Lisa Howarth\u2019s \u2018Flying Shoes\u2019 is a work of fiction. It is based on the still unsolved case of her stepbrother. This is not a crime novel; it is a story of a particular time and place in the South. Everything is inextricably entwined. It is like knitting pattern with many strands of wool, a pattern which does not present itself to the reader easily.The book has a flamboyant cast and a real sense of history. The heart of the story is a shocking and true story. The protagonist talks to the reader in a voice about family and her own memories from a wounded past. The story never delivers in a straightforward pattern. It weaves and makes its way through secondary characters until suddenly we realise the pattern we were knitting all along.

(To be fair, I was too: after seeing the A- Entertainment Weekly paragraph-long review, skimpy on details, I came directly to Goodreads, scanned the blurb (which mentioned a child murder and Mississippi) and I was reeled in) (only to find, upon reading the book, the murder was really a backdrop to a larger, if not more compelling, story Ms. Howorth wished to convey.)That story (which is, apparently, in part fictional autobiography) starts with Mary Byrd, a Mississippi wife and mom (and Virginia transplant) who gets a call from a detective from Richmond to let her know the unsolved murder case of her step-brother, molested and killed over thirty years prior, was going to be reopened and her presence was needed up in Virginia to solve the case. Much to the frustration of many readers, Ms. Howorth, instead of focusing on the murder, has Mary Byrd, in a laconic, slow-sipping-sweet-tea kinda way, recounting the ups and downs, the triumphs, mistakes and regrets of her life. I enjoyed her writing, though I, too, was a little frustrated the farther she got away from the central plot point (the murder of her step-brother). Ms. Howorth's snarky (and, curiously, darned funny) delivery, in presenting Mary Byrd's (Howorth's) present-day (well, 1996 anyway) family and friends was hard to reconcile with the seriousness of that ever-lurking murder (of 1966) in the background. I appreciate the difficulty Ms. Howorth must've had in presenting this story (even if fictionalized). I hope it was able to provide some catharsis, and allow her to fully shine in a fiction-writing career (instead of tap-dancing around what amounts to awkward fictional autobiography)."}, {"userName": "Lolly K Dandeneau", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1412404-lolly-k-dandeneau", "userReview": "Oxford, Mississippi resident Mary Byrd Thornton receives a phone call from a detective that the 30 year old cold case investigation into her then very young half-brother Stevie is being re-opened. She has suffered guilt for many years that she was somehow connected to his murder and while she wants to see justice served, there is hesitation in returning to the painful past that the family has tried to move beyond. The story doesn't revolve solely around Stevie's murder. The reader is given a very large group of characters, and a second murder story as Mary's housekeeper's daughter is accused of killing Angie's abusive husband. There is insight into the plantation past and current racial issues. From the beginning the reader understands there is a set way for people to act in the exchanges between Mary and her housekeeper. While it's a serious story, Mary as a character is cynical and lends the novel much laughter. Every character in this novel is lively and interesting.

Other issues and colorful characters take up more than half of this book before she is able to leave.My thoughts after reading this book...Mary Byrd Thornton has much going on in her life. Two naughty puppies, three cats...two inside and one feral...a lawn and garden to take care of...two recalcitrant children, Evagreen...a stubborn slightly neurotic housekeeper whose daughter just shot her husband, a gay best friend, a husband who may or may not have secrets, a sort of survivalist weird book writing \"friend\" who lives with his auntie and grandmother and who feels better after he shoots something, and a various assortment of local sort of folksy odd Mississippi characters...and for me...not an appealing one in the batch. And...I might add...in fact I will add...Evagreen...the housekeeper...purposefully hides things from Mary Byrd or breaks her things when she cleans...how awful...I didn't like her or Mary Byrd or Mary Byrd's mother...sigh!It took forever for Mary Byrd to leave town because she is afraid to fly and a bit of a pill popper.

I thought that it was going to be about what happened to Stevie thirty years ago and it was and then it wasn't. There were too many cringe worthy moments in this book for me...dog poop and head lice and learning what a FUPA is...I had to google it...and other icky stuff...but that is me...it seemed as though every time I would almost get into this book...dog poop would come up again...and seriously...these are my issues but I was just not excited about this book.

Anything Ann Patchett has been waiting for, put me on that list. I start to get a craving for (so-called) southern fiction in early summer (by mid July I'm all into the Scandinavians -- give me all the ice and snow escapism. One of my most memorable reading experiences remains Smilia's Sense of Snow in August). Anyway, that brings me to the first point -- this isn't like, southern fiction, smack you over the head with Tara and mint juleps. Mary Byrd is one of the most real, likable and utterly unclassifiable characters I have come across. I love Ernest's description of her dark side. I fell for her when she's digging for a Xanax in her jeans pocket in the opening scene. It just so easy to identify with her inner monologue and her decisions. That sounds lame. See, I love her so much I can't even put it into words. As to reading experience, I was sucked in immediately (and disappointed when my eye doctor came to call me). That's how into it I was. That said, it was mostly my love for Mary Byrd that kept me reading -- the novel has no real narrative structure in the traditional sense, and definitely not the more specific \"dark family mystery\" plot that the marketing leads us to expect. The detective's revelations were the most page-turny for me, and I found the novel dragged a bit after that section, but that's also me not liking happy endings. Or resolutions. The other characters are super lovable, in a complicated way, and well drawn. They will people your brain. There's some striking images and passages and plays with language throughout (I particularly liked Ernest's reflections on the Rolling Stones, and Teever's thoughts on family). The most seemingly bizarre connections I wrote in the margins are London Fields and Clockwork Orange, which I think reflects the skill of the writing in parts as well as the ability, at it's best, to tap into that universal subconscious of good fiction.

Like many readers, I pick up a book, consider the title and cover image, glance over the blurbs and dive in eagerly. Most books are clearly represented, but this novel is not easily surmised by any of the typical attributes. Yes, I know, don't judge a book by its cover. Flying Shoes is presented as a mystery. When the character of Mary Byrd Thornton receives a phone call in her Mississippi home concerning a 30-year-old cold case of her murdered stepbrother, it sets the story in motion. The path it takes, however, is not one that is expected. In fact, the story becomes less and less about the mystery and more about the thoughts of the protagonist as she muddles through her middle-age life - demanding children, lukewarm marriage, aging mother.Set in the South, the novel is full of colorful and intriguing characters. The minor characters are not fully developed but it is easy to imagine their lives. Howorth ties the characters together in unexpected ways, from a truck driver who gives Mary a ride during a dangerous winter storm to a housekeeper who deals with a family tragedy of her own and evokes an empathetic response from Mary. With all the bits and pieces given about the characters, I found myself wanting to know more but, like the mystery that unfolds slowly, there is plenty of room for imagination. That, of course, is not a detriment to the story, but I enjoy characters who I come to know and miss when the last page is read. The novel, based on the author's experience of the loss of her stepbrother, is worth reading but be sure to approach the book with an open mind. It is a bit like flying shoes.

This takes Mary Byrd back to the time, place, and family in Virginia where she grew up, and where this happened. She has always had a certain degree of guilt about her younger brother's death, and it has colored her personality and life for nearly as long as she can remember. There is a detective who is working on cold cases, and wants to update the family on details.I found this part of the book really interesting, and thought the author did a good job of evoking people, places, and emotions about this time.

An event like this changes every person in a family in some way, and also changes a community, particularly at a time when people were not necessarily as aware of child predators as they are now.I can't say that I really liked Mary Byrd. She was interesting, but not that appealing to me. I liked the book overall, and kept reading to the end, but found it odd and frankly frustrating when chapters would be about tangential characters. I guess it was supposed to lend flavor of time and place to the story, but I think they could have been left out, or at least shortened, and the main story would have held up just fine."}, {"userName": "Kendra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11547182-kendra", "userReview": "Mary Byrd Thornton receives an unwelcome phone call in the midst of her messy, busy life in Mississippi, telling her that the police in her home town of Richmond, VA believe they have new information about the molestation and murder of her 9 year old step-brother that happened over twenty years earlier. She must put things in order for the trip back to Richmond to try to deal with this dreaded issue ~ see that her children are taken to school, that her husband & kids have food in the house, and figure out how she's going to get to Richmond (she's scared to death of flying). Without \"telling\" us, the author shows us how chaotic Mary Byrd's life is, how she struggles with order, and how much of it is the result of what happened so many years before. At times, I wondered about the relevancy of all Mary Byrd's internal dialogue, her obsession with \"things\", and the way she seemed to be sort of skating on the edge of disaster, but it is all part of the picture of Mary Byrd. In the end, I'm so glad that all those parts I wondered about were in the book. I felt that I knew her, and understood her chaos. I thought this was a very well-written and engaging book."}, {"userName": "Ellen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19931168-ellen", "userReview": "I felt mostly like I was sitting on the porch with Lisa having lemonade and catching up on all the doings around town. Yes at the heart of this novel there is an old unsolved murder. But there are always old stories and secrets in every family and all over every town. The old sadnesses get carried along with us to the beauty shop or the post office and it is in this quotidian way that our real lives get sorted and new memories get made.I met Lisa when I was a guest on her bookstore's Thacker Mountain Radio show last fall. She told me about this book and the long journey she'd been on while she wrote it. But she did not do it justice. Flying Shoes is a juicy little southern character novel. It meanders in a crooked line and takes you to all the best spots in town!"}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2250822-richard", "userReview": "I am a sucker for first novels, imagining there are millions of them around in drawers, closets, cupboards etc. that will never be published. A friend of mine wrote two like Left Behind that were never accepted by a book publisher.Although I swear I will never read another novel set in the deep southern United States, I went ahead with this one because it is a first novel.I cannot understand how it got printed by a legitimate publisher. The characters are all worthless chasing the next party, pill or sexual encounter. All the lives, except for the poor black folks have no meaning. There is tragedy enough for many more families than are effected.I would encourage you to skip this one in spite of the compelling title."}, {"userName": "Hopsnbarley", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6319877-hopsnbarley", "userReview": "This is a tough book to review. The character development was engaging and each of the stories about the characters was interesting. The problem was with the book as a whole. It felt like all of the stories should be building up to something where everything converged, presumably surrounding the long ago unsolved murder, but this never happened. There were well written character stories that stayed independent from the others and so at the end of the day the novel seemed to lack purpose. As a first novel for this author, definitely there are sparks of really enjoyable writing. I would try something by this author again but not sure I would recommend this particular read."}, {"userName": "Beth Farley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4725111-beth-farley", "userReview": "So different from what I was expecting. This book is not plot driven at all. It pretty much just follows this woman, who mostly just has men friends, (her husband is barely even a character in the book), around for a few days, in which several fairly dramatic events take place. But then it switches viewpoints several times too. And the title had very little to do with anything in the book, also. And yet, there were thoughts of the characters and events in it that were very relatable to me."}, {"userName": "Nancy McFarlane", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3130731-nancy-mcfarlane", "userReview": "Lisa Howorth deftly weaves together a beautiful story of the South, family, relationships, racial issues and unresolved guilt. She takes seemingly unrelated strands of stories of people who are important in Mary Byrd\u2019s life and intertwines them until you understand how the unsolved murder of Mary Byrd\u2019s young brother 30 years ago and the guilt she has carried around since then have made her the cynical, needy, self-destructive, funny, and very likable character she is today."}, {"userName": "April", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5992160-april", "userReview": "This book isn't really about anything, but Lisa Holworth can write.It's strange that the summary makes it seem like the story revolves around the murder, but at least half of the book is spent in the point of view of other characters who have nothing to do with that story. Their lives do not tie in to the murder. Their only connection to the 'plot' is that they know Mary Byrd.If you read this book as short stories about life in Mississippi, you'll be a lot more satisfied."}], "description": "Mary Byrd Thornton could understand how a reporter couldn't resist the story: a nine-year-old boy sexually molested and killed on Mother's Day, 1966. A suspect to whom nothing would stick. A neighborhood riddled with secrets. No one, especially the bungling or complicit authorities, had been able to solve the crime. Now, thirty years later, the reporter's call will reel a reluctant Mary Byrd from Mississippi back to Virginia where she must confront her family\u2014and, once again, the murder's irremovable stain of tragedy.Lisa Howorth's remarkable Flying Shoes is a work of fiction, but the murder is based on the still-unsolved case of her stepbrother, a front page story in the Washington Post. And yet this is not a crime novel; it is an honest and luminous story of a particular time and place in the South, where even calamitous weather can be a character, everyone has a story, and all are inextricably entwined. With a flamboyant cast, splendid dark humor, a potent sense of history, and a shocking true story at its heart, Flying Shoes is a rich and candid novel from a fresh new voice about family and memory and one woman's flight from a wounded past.", "title": "Flying Shoes", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18594421-flying-shoes", "average": 2.73, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1398198611l/18594421.jpg", "reviews": 180, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/843164.Lisa_Howorth", "name": "Lisa Howorth"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "American", "Mystery", "Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18594421-flying-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21479325-flying-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/793261.Yellow_Dogs_Hushpuppies_and_Bluetick_Hounds", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23500128-flying-shoes-esampler", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1847111.South", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3019143-the-southern-i-q-quiz-book", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31160055-the-last-cherry-blossom", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26583370-life-and-other-near-death-experiences", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20552595-how-i-became-a-famous-novelist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
