The problem with doing a new treatment of such a classic tale is that you will have the purists up in arms, but I thought the story had a lot to recommend it. I found Alyss a believable character and who wouldn't like Hatter Madigan? I want his backpack."}, {"userName": "emily", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/104806-emily", "userReview": "So, I'd heard of this book before, and when I saw it in the bin marked \"free\" at my old library, I kind of thought I might put it in my middle school classroom for students to read. Then I realized: what might I be giving my students? So I read it.I cannot think of enough negative things to say about this book.First, I have to admit something: I've never even read any of Lewis Carroll's books. Not a one. So I'm no Alice purist. But Mr. Beddor is just straight-up mean-spirited. If you're going to write a metafiction (which is perhaps putting lipstick on the Looking Glass Wars pig), you certainly owe a certain reverence, or even just a bit of politeness, to the source material. Casting Lewis Carroll himself in the book as a bumbling, nervous idiot is just poor form.Dayenu, that would have been enough.Let's get to the meat. Character naming. King Nolan? This is only slightly a tougher name than Lord Poodlepants. Princess Alyss? I have an  article Mr. Beddor should read, but let's just leave it that Alyss will probably not become a neurosurgeon. And so on. There were moments of charming creativity there (I'll admit, calling the elite card soldiers \"the Cut\" was cute), but really.Dayenu.I have an ARC, so I will hope the writing and grammar improve. But things ultimately got so bad that I started bookmarking pages specifically with the purpose of listing them here. \". . . and out of the vacuous dark stepped a girl.\" Vacuous does not mean what he thinks it does. \". . . with the play of the suns on their caps and the multihued shadows they cast on the valley floor, the Alyssians were greeted.\" The subject of the beginning part of this sentence? Mushrooms. Not delightful headgear being worn by our heroes. But, sadly, the misplaced modifiers kill us dead. Heartbreaking.Dayenu.The dialogue! This is the sort of book in which we get full quotation marks for stupid things, like a character's \"yeah\" of assent. Also, is it just me, or do you fall totally out of the story when the author bothers to include things like \"whoa\" and \"duh\" on a regular basis? Maybe I'm too picky. Also, there's this really bizarre scene with the assassin \"the Cat\" going all Travis Bickle on a bunch of trees. Full on \"I don't see anyone else here, so you must have been talking to me.\" How are we, as the readers, supposed to respond to this? Are we supposed to think a (bioengineered? animatronic? I have no damn idea?) cat in an alternate dimension is the inspiration for Taxi Driver? (Remember, this book takes place in (the equivalent of) the 1850s-1860s.) Are we supposed to think he's witty in quoting a kind of played out line of dialogue he has no way of knowing? This takes place maybe 70 or 80 pages into a 300+ page book and it stands out to me now. I have no idea where Mr. Beddor was going with this, but he's the creative mind who produced \"There's Something about Mary,\" so we know he's up on pop culture.Dayenu.We meet Hatter Madigan, who has nothing at all to do with the Mad Hatter except a similar name and the ownership of a top hat. I'm of the impression that we're supposed to think he's terrifically cool, given his being real quiet and being good at fighting. After all, pop culture is full of this kind of stuff -- we love quiet dudes who are tough. The problem is this: he has no actual personality. We see him brood by a fire once. We see him chuck around his hat a lot. We get no dialogue (or monologue) explaining anything about why he's supposed to be interesting. (I also have the sense he may be supposed to be a little something for the ladies, but once again, this is my reading of a book that makes no damn sense, and hell if I can figure out why or how, unless we're just supposed to remember that quiet, tough guys generally = James Dean or Dirty Harry.)Dayenu.The worst thing Mr. Beddor could think of about Jack of Diamonds was to give him a big butt? Seriously? The man is clearly a creep and everyone is dumb enough to trust him, against all odds and against any normal human behavior. Are all the characters idiots? Are they supposed to be fooled by his giant hiney? (PS: How do you SPELL the word pronounced \"hiney?\" Because I thought it would be funny here but can't quite type it.)Dayenu.Last one, I swear. And this is totally leaving out the big villain Redd, who deserves to be left out for sucking so badly. But. \"Wondertropolis?\" This sounds like some sort of lame facebook-based game where you'd click on things in exchange for points. From the second I read it, I WANTED Wondertropolis to fall. (When I was growing up, I lived near a day camp called \"Camp Wonderfun.\" I felt the same way about that.) And the Wonderlanders in Wondertropolis? Did Mr. Beddor never say these names aloud? They're freaking tongue twisters. I hate Wondertropolis so bad. And it's a magical land fueled by imagination! With a \"Heart Crystal\" (which you would totally click on in the Wondertropolis facebook game). And the characters have magical powers of imagination. This is lame when it's hawked by Figment at Epcot, and he's cute and has all of Disney behind him. But when you have two characters battling it out with their all-powerful imaginations? You're getting into territory best left unentered.Anyway. I hated this book. A lot. It's not going into my classroom, ever."}, {"userName": "Greg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42508-greg", "userReview": "[But the real problem being if you are like almost every living person and have seen at least the original Star Wars trilogy, then you have a pretty good idea where this book is going at a certain point, and I'd bet good money about what is going to happen in future books because of the Lucas trajectory the story seems set on, I could be wrong though.

To the rest of you, enjoy.That said, let me say that I loved this book. I read Alice (Wonderland and Looking Glass) this past semester for a children's lit class so it was cool to approach this book with those stories so recently re-impressed on my mind. However, you definitely don't NEED those books close at hand to enjoy this book. In fact, as many Carroll lovers vehemently point out, this book is very different from the original Alice books. But then, if you want to get down to it, Beddor and the publisher make that quite clear...this is NOT the Alice you know. \nLewis Carroll got it all wrong\n.That's not to say you won't find it interesting to have some Alice/Carroll knowledge hanging around. Beddor does a good job of showing us tidbits of \"true\" history in this story. He weaves in bits of Alice's and Carroll's history throughout the story. But it's not essential that you know what is \"fact\" and what is \"fiction\" in order to enjoy this.So, approach this book like you would any good adventure-fantasy book and prepare to be amazed. While his concepts are not entirely unique, Beddor does a great way of weaving them together in new and intriguing ways to weave together a great story. Some of the characters familiar to you from the earlier Alice books will be present, but they will take on exciting and interesting new roles. The world of Wonderland is a complex place will interesting rules and methods not present in Carroll's Wonderland.The thrust of the plot is a political power struggle and the war that results. Even then, the politics are fairly lightweight and don't detract from the other main plot. The other main plot is one that remains strangely true to the original Alice...the heart of that plot being Alyss' struggle for personal identity. Alyss is tossed into our non-wonderful world and finds herself mocked and misunderstood for her vivid imagination and wild stories about Wonderland. After a long time of struggling, her despair gets the better of her and she denies her previous self. (possible spoiler) When she gets back to Wonderland, she has to struggle with that identity of her past and rekindle her belief and sense of wonder in order to help win the war.The characters were great. The introspection with Alyss, particularly as we approach and climax at the final battle, is exquisitely drawn out. Hatter is a bit stoic for my taste, but believable. And I wanted a little more out of Dodge at the end of the book.My two main criticisms with the book are: time and dialog.TIMETime passes VERY quickly and sporadically in this book. Sometimes spanning years in a couple of sentences and other times very drawn out (there's actually a sort of suspension of time as Alyss attempts a certain test, but I won't spoil that by explaining it). Most of the time, this worked well. But there were quite a few times where I found myself disoriented and trying to figure out 'when' I was. This was particularly the case during the main chapters following Alyss' life in 'our world.' She enters our world at age 7. I had a hard time distinguishing how long she actually spent on the (spoilers?) streets with the orphans, how long in the orphanage, how long with the Liddell's before meeting Dodgson, how long..., how long..., etc. Time whipped by.While I admit that the \"real world\" wasn't the crux of the story, I would like to have seen the architecture of the timeline stabilized a bit more. It was also problematic to try and gauge distances by time as Alyss and her company trekked across the landscape of Wonderland under Redd's ever attentive eye and her Seekers. My thinking was that some of these journeys should have taken days...or weeks. And yet we're not given any indication as to duration which left it feeling like hours or minutes. This is especially true for me as the group makes their final trek to mount the final assault against Redd. Based on the descriptions of the landscape, I expected this to take a day or more. However, the reactions of Redd and her group made it feel like it was a quick trip...couple that with the way Alyss and company actually approach, and it gets even shorter.So time was off-putting to me.DIALOGThe dialog was generally really very, very good. Lines felt sincere and true to the characters. The tone and voice was consistent and sounded good.My main difficulty was in lack of speaker acknowledgment at times. There were occasions where a line or two of dialog appears suddenly without any \"Alyss said\" or \"Hatter grunted\" or any of that. Usually you could figure it out by context, but I found myself having to reread some lines to be sure.The most common were in the handful of exclamations that were more sound than dialog -- \"Aah\", for example. It's a great effect that jolts the reader into the sense of shock or pain of the character, but without an identifier, it distracted from the moment if I had to try and deduce which character just got slammed or whatever.The other problem was that the words and phrases sometimes sounded too modern for the time. I can write some of this away by the explanation of the relation between Wonderland and our world. It seems that (as evidenced by the inventions sent through the heart crystal), our world is somewhat behind Wonderland and relies on Wonderland for its innovation and progress. If that's the case, then this could be presented as an explanation (albeit rickety) for the modern tone of some of the speech.____________________________________Still. All in all, I loved this and look forward to the next book in the series.****4 out of 5 stars."}, {"userName": "\u2665BookGeek\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2254001-bookgeek", "userReview": "Why does she love this book you ask? Let me count the ways...First before I start, I don't want to hear any of your crap about this book. I've read it five time and counting, I know... just wanted to make that clear ok?Reasons why I'm reading this book again:-The way Beddor handles the story is creative.I don't want to hear that \"Alice is the WHOLE WORLD HOW CAN HE DESTROY A SUPERB CLASSIC!!!\" Now, I do love Alice in Wonderland dearly. I do think is a great classic. And I don't hate it like Mr. Beddor does. But for God's SAKE people! It's a remake of the story! And it's an original, believable story. I mean, Redd (based on the Queen of Hearts) is SUPPOSED to be an EVIL QUEEN right?-The characters are AH-MAZING!Don't want to hear crap about that either. I've heard from several reviews that his characters are one dimensional, uninteresting unoriginal characters. And I'll agree to that to some extent. But I still love their freshness, the jump off the page characters, you know where every single one of the characters come from too which is nice. (By the way Dodge haters,if I was in Dodge's place, I would go and battle the Cat.)Frank Beddor gives these fairy tale characters a life. That's all a character asks for.-The writing is really goodAgain, no crap. The book is not about writing. It's about PLOT. In this book, writing helps the characters and plot move. It isn't supposed to make you go \"WOW!\" You know, some books aren't made to have superb, amazing high quality writing. But this is pretty decent writing already. So shut up about that.-It stays faithful to the original book.No guys, LGW DOSEN'T dumb down Alice. Beddor just takes a different turn. Can you accept that for once? The characters already show it, and the London part shows it. Just read those parts again and tell me if I'm a stupid moron and I don't get it. The message of this book is: \"Carroll got it wrong\" not: \"Alice is such a stupid little book! Let's see my take on it because I want to be greedy! YAY!\" I reread Alice after I read this, I looked at it with whole new eyes without thinking less of it. If you guys think I'm an idiotic moron who dosen't have a life, comment here. But please do realize that I do respect hater's opinion, I'm just sick of all the complaints and the \"THIS AUTHOR MUST DIE!\" on One-Star reviews. OK!

I almost never start on an author's writing style but in this case, it was a significant factor in how I viewed the book. The style described too much in the wrong cases, not enough with the right ones. There was also a lot of telling rather than showing. The short, almost inconsiderate descriptions of the character's feelings made it seem false. I couldn't get a grasp on the characters at all.This was an absolutely brilliant idea. If it had been executed differently, this could have risen to Harry Potter status--or at least, it would have had the potential to. The idea was fresh, new and incredible. It just...never took off the ground for me. I found myself skipping pages and I would still know exactly what was going on.Writing aside, nothing anchored me to the characters. Even if you hate a character, that means that there was enough given that you're CAPABLE of hating them. It means that they were put through situations and were complete and total idiots and did a million things wrong and you hate their guts for it. But at least you have the proof. When you can't even cast an opinion on a character...oooh, well, that just goes to show that you weren't shown much. But Dodge and Alyss had such incredible potential! I just wish they were shown better. I could have really come to love them as characters. Same goes for the antagonist. Redd was downright creepy at first, but she quickly lost credibility.The dialog required much-needed help. It was mostly in the dialog that I lost the characters. Even with the sometimes skimpy writing, dialog can pick up the slack. Not in this case, though. I wrote a review for this now because I'm 95% certain that I won't be picking it up again. If I ever have children, I would try it out on them because it's more of a read out loud kind of book. But for readers who have a preference for more complex, lyrical writing that must be read inwardly, I don't recommend this book to you.I gave it a B- because I respect the idea so much. It wouldn't feel right to bring it lower than \"B\" status. Perhaps if Frank Beddor writes another series, I would take a chance on it.

She's more interested in getting out of the palace with her friend from the royal guard, Dodge Andrews, and getting into a bit of trouble.But when her ostricized aunt Redd storms the castle and engages her mother, Genevieve, in a battle of imaginations, Alyss must run for her life. She escapes the castle through her mother's private looking glass, which dumps her in the forest that borders the Pool of Tears. Along with Hatter Madigan, the dark, silent captain of the Queen's bodyguards, Alyss jumps into the Pool of Tears and is carried to a land far away, where she meets a young and uninspired writer who thinks that her stories of Wonderland are quite extraordinary.I feel like I should expound on Hatter Madigan, as he totally made this book for me.Hatter Madigan wears a long black trenchcoat, with a rucksack on his back, silver wristbands, and a high top hat that he never takes off, unless absolutely necessary. He is quick, acrobatic, quiet, and wields the throwing knives that protrude from his hat with chilling accuracy.I honestly giggled when I saw his illustration.And I'm afraid to read the sequel (Seeing Redd) because I don't want to finish so quickly that I have to wait ridiculous amounts of time for the third in the trilogy.I suppose I'll just have to take that risk."}, {"userName": "Ren the Unclean", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/243750-ren-the-unclean", "userReview": "This book has a really interesting premise and a cool take on a classic story. The characters are very interesting, especially Hatter Madigan, General Doppelganger, and Bibwit Harte.My main problem with this book is that Beddor does not do a very good job of writing the story. It is sort of as though he is writing it like a person who is very impressed with the story they are telling you, rather than telling you a story that is impressive on its own. This is sort of strange, since the subject matter and characters basically hold their own, without the sometimes ridiculous embellisments of the author.Some of the dialogue in the story is also sort of grating, especially most of the stuff Redd says, though this may be because the dialogue in Alice in Wonderland is somewhat over the top. Also, the semi-post-apocalyptic setting that gets set up during Redd's reign seems really out of place and sort of forces the story into the 1984 mold in a somewhat unnatural way. Rather than being dystopian, where these types of themes work really well, the world is just obviously oppressive. I am sort of obsessed with dystopian societies, so I am probably judging this too harshly.Overall, I would reccommend this book, if only because it is a good story that introduces an interesting take on Alice in Wonderland. If you really liked AiW, then definitely read this book."}, {"userName": "TL ", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4342402-tl", "userReview": "This was alot of fun and an interesting spin on Wonderland.

This story revolves around Alys (princess of Wonderland) who escapes to Earth to avoid being murdered by her Aunt Redd and the Cat assassin. Hatter M. is a special bodyguard who travels to Earth as well to protect Alys but is separated from her. His famous weapon is his hat (which I would love to own in real life!), which can become a spinning, deadly blade. Back in Wonderland there is also Dodge, who was the son of a royal guardsmen and is now a mercenary fighting the evil Redd. And the Alyssian army also rebels against the new, false queen. There are several other characters that are based off the original story but Beddor has added his own twists to them. The book is filled with fun little quips that make the reader smile. The story is easy to read, and moves at a good pace (mostly at least). My only concern was that the characters were not easy to feel and get into at times.

easily compose a rant about how this book sucks so hard that light has a hard time escaping its gravity well, but instead of just bashing let's take an objective look at why this book is so very very bad.The Looking Glass Wars is a triumph of artistic design and marketing. The concept is immediately simple and intriguing. Wonderland is real. Alice Liddell was a princess on the run and Lewis Carroll mangled the truth. Alyss grows up and goes back to save a ruined Wonderland. The cover art is amazing, and the book is filled with things that fantasy lovers adore like maps and timelines. There is a website where you can play games related to the book, or buy a CD of atmospheric music to listen to while you read. There is even a comic book series about one of the secondary characters. How cool, right?Unfortunately the actual book is a mess. I can't grasp why there are so many positive reviews of this book, and it seems that many of the people who like it say that the people who don't just couldn't handle the manipulation of the original story. Listen, I've got no problem with that. I think the concept is loaded with potential. It is just a bad book. And I can't even say, \"But that's just my opinion.\" It is clearly very poorly written. I mean the author has characters say \"Noooooo!\" Who does that? Four times, when confronted with bad situations, characters in this novel actually shout \"Nooooooo!\" On film it would play as a bad joke, but in literature it is just inexcusable.Almost nothing is sufficiently described. There are lots of talking and fighting chessmen in the book, but we're never told exactly what that means. Are they anthropomorphic rooks and bishops with arms and legs, or people that wear armor in the shapes of those pieces, or robots like Redd's card soldiers? We are never told, and they play a big part in the narrative. And orb generators. I still don't know what an orb generator does. They wield it like some type of gun, and I would imagine that it generates orbs, but apparently it just shoots orb generators. Like a bad guy can come in holding an orb generator and fire it and then it says that the good guys then had to dodge all of the orb generators flying around. I guess that means what they really are is orb generator generators, if what they really generate is orb generators. Great job, you wacky author you.And let's talk about Redd and Alyss' imagination powers. Apparently they can imagine anything and it happens. Like Green Lantern, but better. So can they imagine money or jewels? If so why do they need workers in the mines? Alyss can't imagine a fire into being, but she can imagine a solid metal lid that floats down to put out the fire. What? If they can simply imagine food into existence, why are people going hungry? Why can you not imagine someone dead, but you can stab them to death with imaginary knives? It is implied that if Alyss' imagination was strong enough, she could imagine a whole army of soldiers. Then why do they have flesh and blood soldiers, and why do they have to build robot soldiers? If they can imagine guinea pigs and worms into existence, then these characters have the godlike ability to create life from nothing but these ideas are never expanded on or dealt with. Just thrown in to get the story to the next chase scene. Which there are a lot of.Who is this book written for? The violence and expensive spin-off materials ($75 for a Looking Glass Wars themed art book!) would imply adult readers, but the juvenile sense of humor would indicate otherwise. For example one character has a fat butt, and the book just goes on and on about this like I'm supposed to be giggling ever time it is mentioned. He gets stuck in a chair and other characters have to tug him out. Hilarious, right? I share with you an exchange between prophetic caterpillars while they're getting high off their hookahs:\"I'm having the weirdest sense of deja vu right now,\" said the green caterpillar. \"Duh!\" said the yellow caterpillar. \"Do you think, just maybe, that's because you predicted this?\" \"Oh, yeah.\" The caterpillar council tittered.I'm wrapping this up, because if you actually found that funny then there's not much I can do to change your mind. SOUND EFFECTS! Who does sound effects in literature? I mean come on! Here are some of my favorites:Kabooooooorrrchk!Thimp thimp thimp! Thimp thimp thimp!Kraaaaawbooosh!Zzzomp!Clangk! Skrich-onk!And from the big climactic battle:Krrrrrkkkchsss! Hissszzzzl! Krrrch! Zzzzssszz!I'm not making this up. I wish I was.

And that is just what this book is. To help you decide if this book is for you, ask yourself the following:Do you love Alice in Wonderland?

(Duh)Do you love strong heroines who aren't all \"woe is me?\" (Who doesn't?)Are you into fantasy? (Naturally)Do you like it when a book makes you want to curl up in the fetal position and bawl your eyes out? (I know ya do)Do you adore hot, kick-ass dudes that actually treat girls with respect? (If you say no to this one, then you have issues, child)Do awesome descriptions of gorgeous, magical, unique settings make you want to do a happy dance?

It is a well-constructed retelling, that places Alice as the Queen of Hearts' daughter and consequently the next-in-line for Wonderland's throne. When the evil Red Queen, Queen Genevieve's sister, attacks the palace with her army of card soldiers, Alice - or Alyss - is sent via the Pool of Tears tunnel to a parallel world - ours, but during the life-time of Lewis Carroll, by the Queen's faithful bodyguard Hatter Madigan (you know him), to keep her safe until things have calmed down. Is is kind of fun recognizing the elements of the well-known story and noticing how cleverly they are twisted. But nonetheless I feel inexplicably bored. Why I cannot say. A second sore spot is Alyss age and her behavior during the first chapters. Yes, even I dreamed of certain boys in kindergarden, and yes, I know, princesses start thinking about marriages and political alliances quite early, but that dancing-almost-kissing scene between seven year old Alyss and her ten year old devoted commoner friend Dodge of the royal guard and their respective hidden feelings for each other was depicted far too mature and lovey-dovey in an unrealistic sort of way to me. Add ten years each and it's alright. My opinion is that if an author cannot even partly remember what it was like to be seven should avoid shoving the spotlight on a character of that particular age.So, I decided to let the book drop at page 80. This is not meant as an discouragement to pick it up and try. Heads-off-screaming Queen Redd is fun and the Diamond Prince's deflated bottom a nice thing to visualize.Tina, please assign another book to me. I am ready to switch."}, {"userName": "Janeen-san ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1566203-janeen-san", "userReview": "Book: The Looking Glass Wars (The Looking Glass Wars, #1) Author: Frank BeddorAwesomeness level: 5/5Began: November 9, 2009Finished: November 14, 2009It was a long time ago when I saw Seeing Redd, Frank Beddor's second book in The Looking Glass Wars trilogy, at Barnes & Noble. Back then, I didn't care about it, I didn't know that I'd finish The Looking Glass Wars at 3:22 in the morning, not willing to sleep until I knew how the first book ended. I didn't know I'd squeal with excitment when Hatter Madigan or any other characters supporting White Imagination were mentioned.In short, I didn't know how amazing this book would be.Alyss Heart is seven years old when the fantastic story begins, and separated from her parents when her murderous aunt Redd attacks the Heart Palace, wanting the crown for herself. Alyss and her bodygaurd, Hatter Madigan, escape on the Queen's orders to the Pool of Tears. Where does it lead? No one knows, for the simple reason that no one's ever returned.Where does it lead?The Pool of Tears leads to a very strange world--Our own.Alyss and Hatter are separated, Alyss turns up in Victorian London, Hatter in Paris. Hatter spends 13 years searching the world for her, detirmined to find her so they can return to Wonderland and battle Redd for her rightful place as the Queen of Hearts.Alyss, meanwhile, is told her stories of Wonderland are rubbish, but she knows better...Right?Will Hatter and Alyss find each other, and can she succed in battling her evil aunt Redd?"}, {"userName": "earthy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/657422-earthy", "userReview": "Another victim of the great concept, crummy execution flop.Beddor gives us flimsy, uninteresting characters on a backdrop he's obviously fleshed out in his own mind to the point of an obsessive teenaged boy writing Epic Fantasy (*cough*), and he's so concerned that you envision his world exactly as he does that he spends sentence after dull, plodding sentence describing battles and contraptions in minute detail. Folks, if you're that concerned with the precise visualization of your world, you're not writing a novel; you're writing a comic (which, incidentally, Beddor later did).We've actually seen this concept before (i.e., Alice in Wonderland Gone Horribly Wrong)--it's called American McGee's Alice, and it's a delightful, if violent, computer game which manages to have much more compelling Alice and Cheshire Cat characters than this rocky mess of a novel does.Beddor obviously has a great imagination in so far as locations and mechanial devices are concerned, and his artwork shows some real promise, but his narrative form leaves much to be desired. I'm willing to bet some of these problems could be avoided if he were better at matching the appropriate story to the appropriate medium.

I was doing so well, reading books that weren't always perfect, and yet I always found something in them I could enjoy. And then my roommate recommended this book to me, and I found myself taking it. It seemed interesting: a completely new take on Alice In Wonderland, one in which Alice does not stumble blindly down a rabbit hole, but in which she is a princess of Wonderland, brought to Earth as a means of protection when her family is murdered by her evil Aunt Redd.It could have been amazing. But was it?No.This was not a bad book. And yet, after finishing it, I couldn't name one thing about it in which I enjoyed. While the premise may have been intriguing, the execution was not handled well.The author tried to create something completely new, while also trying to keep the main characters that were so beloved in Alice in Wonderland. Unfortunately, he did not succeed. Most of the ways he twisted these characters made me raise my eyebrows, like the White Rabbit being a man with rather large ears named Bibwit Harte and Alice being named Alyss. I couldn't understand the author's decision to change the spelling of her name, other than it being a \"clever ploy\" to get the reader's attention. All of these changes seemed pointless and did not work for me.The pacing itself was off, and I couldn't quite get a grip on the story. The novel itself spans at least fourteen years, from Alyss as a young girl at age 7, and continuing on until she was over the age of twenty. This is a very broad span of time for a novel to cover, and the author did not manage it well. It seemed choppy, with parts seeming to skim by without the reader having enough time to grasp the events that happened.The storyline tried to be something different, and it was. But it just did not intrigue me. I found myself skimming pages, waiting for it to be over. I found a lot of the dialogue stinted, lacking a sense of realism that really hurt my enjoyment of the novel.The only thing that caught my attention was the use of imagination as a sort of \"superpower.\" Imagination in this novel was a tangible thing, in which the user could create anything they willed. Although intriguing, it wasn't explained enough, and it also seemed like a means for the main characters to do whatever they wanted with little to no challenge. Alyss loses her imagination when she leaves Wonderland, and yet she seems to get it back almost immediately after returning, and is soon more powerful than anyone else, despite only practicing a few limited times.Overall, there was so much potential, but it just wasn't executed well.

Maybe even as low as a 3.5.The Looking Glass Wars is an alternate history retelling of Lewis Carroll\u2019s Alice\u2019s Adventures in Wonderland/Through the Looking Glass books. Beddor reimagines the children\u2019s classic as non-fiction: Alyss Hart, a Wonderlander, comes to Earth in a time of crisis (her evil aunt Redd has attacked Wonderland in her quest to become the Queen of Hearts), and she finds herself in a far different reality. On Earth, she is just a young girl with no allies and a fading Imagination. When she is adopted by the Liddell family, and comes across the young deacon Charles Dodgson (aka Lewis Carroll) she thinks she has found a sympathetic soul. She tells him her story -- which he then publishes in the drastically altered tale that we know. Disheartened, Alyss (now Alice) tries to adjust to life on Earth and forget about Wonderland. But all is not right in Wonderland, and the two worlds Alyss knows are about to collide.For much of this book, I was fairly indifferent. It came highly recommended by a number of friends, and I am completely smitten with the Alice story and will read/watch* anything having to do with the insanely fabulous world Carroll created. So I really wanted to love this, and at times I did. But for much of the book (probably the first \u00bd or so), I just didn\u2019t. I felt Beddor struggled to find the tone he wanted; it waffled back and forth between an imitation of Carroll\u2019s light, irreverent style, and a more current, action-drama feel. Also, with attention divided between the two worlds, Wonderland and Earth, it never felt like either got the attention it deserved, and I never got to really live in either and experience it, which was disappointing. But there were moments when I got what I wanted, when the worlds became real and the action was compelling, and the tension was high and I was in it. I just wanted that to be more consistent.Eventually, the book did find a middle path and start to come together, and I will say that I saw enough in it to like that I will certainly keep reading, and do not really regret spending the money on it. I am not saying this is not a good book, just that I wanted more, and didn\u2019t quite get it.On a side note, the card soldiers (idea and illustrations) was absolutely brilliant.*And would you believe I missed Alice on SyFy? Remembered it was on when Ep 2 was nearly over. Really, desperately irritated with myself on that one. Esp. as the Mad Hatter in it is simply delicious. Must track it down and watch.!!!SPOILERY!!!I felt that some of the choices Beddor made were just kind of iffy and it sometimes made the story less believable, or at least questionable. Perhaps the biggest was his choice of the starting age for Alyss, combined with the love interest in Dodge. In the beginning of the story, Alyss is celebrating her 7th birthday. Dodge, her best friend and future guard, is three years older. Now, for those ages, I can believe that there may be some infatuation on the part of each child, and I can even believe that they are devoted to each other in their child\u2019s way. I\u2019m okay with it when you set them up as future love interests -- I don\u2019t mind seeing early where this is going, and knowing who to root for. But I don\u2019t buy it when you try to set them up as already in love and acting like star-crossed lovers. It\u2019s too weighty for their ages, and it just seems a little silly at best, and a little creepy at worst. Their interaction was amateurish, which I guess it at the heart of my complaints with the book in general.The second choice that bothered me was how easily things happened. As someone who works in film, I would have expected Beddor to be a little more concerned with the journey and the struggles that develop a story and add tension. I would feel tension building and I would think something was going to be thrilling and crucial, and instead it would end too quickly. As a result of the idea of Imagination that Beddor set up, things came to easily and ruined the tension level.I am looking forward to reading book 2: Seeing Redd, and I have high hopes that with experience, Beddor will improve and do the story credit; he\u2019s a good storyteller, just not necessarily as good a writer -- yet.Bonus materials and what not on the blog."}, {"userName": "Yomna hosny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9096571-yomna-hosny", "userReview": "This is one of those book that people either love with the fiery vengeance of a thousand suns or loathe so completely they wish eternal doom and damnation onto everyone who so much as hints that they liked it.I gave it a firm five stars so.. :DOriginal review can be found here: http://theliteraryinsomniac.tumblr.co...Anyways.. allow me to explain myself. Ahem.This book uses actual historical events to create parallel, similar events in the story. elements from the second world war, The american civil war and several other key moments in history are incorporated. I hadn\u2019t realized that at first. but when I read the timeline at the end of the book, I was really blown away by the depth of detail that went into this.This book, aside from being a beautifully designed book with 8 pages of full color, glossy inserts of art showing gorgeous renditions of the main characters, several dividers and margin art on every page, is a \u201cbig\u201d story. it covers a significant portion of a country\u2019s history in leaps and bounds. events happen and you get to see their far off consequences a few pages later. And it manages to keep that pace throughout the entire book.This might be an Alice in wonderland re-imagining but it\u2019s wholly unique. It combines fantasy and magic with futuristic, science-y technology for an incredibly entertaining effect. but at its heart, it\u2019s a story about the triumph of good over evil and loyalty and a coming of age story and a story about lost love and how people who change never really become the same ever again.Alyss Heart is the future queen of wonderland. A child, still when her mother, Queesn genevive is killed and overthrown by REDD, genevive\u2019s sister.The main conflict between the two sisters is Redd\u2019s use of her magical, imaginative abilities in the service of evil, selfish whims and Genevive, being the \u201cgood guy\u201d becoming favored by her parents so much that Redd is denied the right to the throne to which she is rightfully entitled by right of succession. (she\u2019s the eldest of the two sisters)Ensue revenge and plotting, war and plunder. In the middle of all that is little seven year old Alyss who gets cut off from her home and forced to suppress her roots in the human world. Only finding comfort when a man approaches her to tell her story in a book. a book that he changes, twists and defiles so much that is a gross bastardization of the true story that Alyss told. The man even spells her name wrong.

Alyss is princess and heir to the throne of Wonderland. However, her evil aunt, Redd, stages a coup and overthrows her mother, Queen Genevieve. Alyss escapes through the Pool of Tears and lands in London, where eventually she meets Reverand Charles Dodgson--the one person on earth who seems to believe her tale of Wonderland. He offers to write a book about it, but to her horror, it's not a biography of the treacheries of Aunt Redd, but a children's fable. So Alice is faced with some hard choices: accept that she is now part of the human world and forget Wonderland and her right to the throne or fight to remember and bring White Imagination back to its glory days.When I read the summary of the plot, I was immediately intrigued. I love it when authors take classic stories and give it a good twist (i.e.,  Gregory Maquire's  Wicked). And from the onset of the book, you are brought into a new world of wonder and amazement turned upside down (seemingly appropriate considering the origins of this story). The story weaves between the human world (London 1860s) and Wonderland. I loved the insertion of various historical figures. Charles Dodgson's (aka Lewis Carroll) real life muse was Alice Liddell--Alyss' adopted name. There really was a Prince Leopold whom it was rumored considered Alice Liddell as a wife. Alice Liddell did indeed have a son, named after him, and whom Prince Leopold was the godfather. He, in turn, had a daughter named Alice.I liked the play on the various characters. Hatter Madigan is the Queen's bodyguard. The Catepillers are the oracles and keepers of the Looking Glass Maze, which only the rightful heir to the throne can attempt. Soldiers are cards (2s and 3s lower ranking, Knights and Rooks higher up the chain). The ranking families are the House of Hearts, Spades, Diamonds, and Clubs--although the House of Hearts are the true rulers. Prince \"Jack\" of Diamonds is considered a potential husband Princess Alyss. The \"Cat\" is a terrifying assasin. Bibwitt Harte is the wise old master who trains and teaches every Queen about the history and duties of her station. He is an albino and has long floppy ears. The only thing missing is a pocket watch.**SPOILERS**I have few complaints with the story. I found it engaging and fun. However, the author tended to skip around parts that I felt could have used more time in exploring. Things hinted at sometimes were never really resolved (although, this being the first in a series, perhaps he was holding those cards close and planning on \"playing\" them later). The war against Redd was laughably short for the build up that was given. I understand that this is meant for the tween ages so such lack in continuity and choppy writing can be forgiven (though, I do hope that his writing grows better with each new addition).I thought this was a great conception and decent execution. It's no Harry Potter, but few are. This, though, makes one believe in the joy of fantasy nonetheless."}], "description": "Alyss of Wonderland?When Alyss Heart, heir to the Wonderland throne, must flee through the Pool of Tears to escape the murderous aunt Redd, she finds herself lost and alone in Victorian London.
