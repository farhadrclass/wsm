Maybe they just read the book jacket. I would have liked to read the book described there. But in reality it's just empty. It repeats things over and over - the trite expressions that Zoe said, the fact that \"Krissy loves her Daddy\". And oh yeah, Zoe was murdered. Got to mention that again every other page, or the reader might forget. It's just lazy writing. Instead of constructing characters with depth, Oates just repeats the bare facts and mantra-like thoughts of the characters. I understand that repetition can be powerful if thoughtfully executed, but here it just seems like padding to get the book up past 400 pages. I felt like these characters had the potential to be interesting, but I just didn't get anything out of this book. There were no surprises - just a cliched drunken father, doting daughter, rough, misunderstood macho boy. I thought it might get better when we switched to Aaron's point of view, but I honestly couldn't tell the difference between his stream of consciousness rambling and Krissy's. I tried reading a page at random to see if I could guess who's \"voice\" it was in, but it all sounded the same to me. I know that Oates has a reputation for being a good writer, but that doesn't mean that every book she cranks out is automatically brilliant. To everyone who started the book but couldn't bring themselves to finish it, go ahead and read chapter five and the last paragraph. That should pretty much do you for."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60977-jennifer", "userReview": "This is hard for me to admit, because I am a huge JCO fan (I think the world of her), but I just couldn't get into Little Bird of Heaven. Loved the setting. Loved much of the description and use of language. Loved the set-up--a murder, an affair, her father accused of killing his mistress, the familial upheaval that ensues--but it didn't grab me. Everything just felt so slow and drawn out. I wanted less intricate detail and more juice.(I wonder if it's just me and my short attention span combined with a nagging pickiness that is to blame, and not the novel itself, and maybe if I pick it back up in a few months, I'll love it?) On a random side note, it did remind me that as a girl/teenager, I swore to myself that, unlike my parents, when I was an adult making my own decisions, I would drive a cool car. And do I? No! (Mostly because when we bought the car, practicality won over style, and I wasn't the only one making the decision.) Anyway, it reminded me of my inability to understand why my mom drove such a dowdy car, and at some point in the not so distant future, I need to make good on my promise.But back to JCO's Little Bird: For now, two stars, but with the caveat that I only read about 70 pages, and I plan to give it another chance in six months.P.S. Goodreads, if you're reading this. I suggest you add a fourth \"put aside\" option to the current three choices: \"read,\" \"currently reading,\" or \"to read.\" I created a shelf for all the books I decide to put aside, so I can see what I actually finish and what I wasn't able to read through to the end."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/900147-laura", "userReview": "This is the story of two American families - the Crullers and the Diehls, living in Sparta, New York.

It has all her signatures - -the stylization of her writing, the focus on family narrative as destiny, and the mixture of pain and love. The stylized writing in this book is more pronounced than in some of her others. She repeats some things multiple times for emphasis and for varied affect. Initially, this bothered me but as the book progressed, I was so caught up in the narrative that nothing could deter me from wanting to turn to the next page.As in her other books, love is closely mixed with pain, sexual and emotional longing, cruelty and betrayal. The family narrative is examined as destiny. She explores the theme of wanting to rewrite our narratives with the hope that this time it can turn out differently. The characters are drawn to people and events that remind them of their pasts, painful as they were. However, they hope that by reliving the past, they can change the outcome. Oates asks the reader, `Can we really change our destinies?' She acknowledges the fact that life is ever-changing but people are caught up in the current of family destinies.This novel is about the murder of a young woman named Zoe Kruller. She is a singer in a local band, mother of Aaron and estranged wife of Delray. There are two persons of interest, suspects in this murder - - Delray Kruller, Zoe's estranged husband, and Eddie Diehl, Zoe's lover. Eddie is the father of Krista and he has been having an affair with Zoe for quite some time. Once the murder occurs he is shunned by his wife and made to leave their home.The story is told in two parts, from two viewpoints. The first half of the book is told from the vantage point of Krista Diehl, Eddie's daughter. She is close to her father and loves him unconditionally. She believes with all her heart that he could not have murdered Zoe. She believes that Delray Kruller is the murderer. Krista becomes obsessed with Aaron Kruller though at the time of the murder she is in grade school and he is a middle school student, about four years Krista's senior. She believes she loves him and begins to shadow him, appearing at places he is known to go.Aaron's story is the second half of this novel. He is the one who finds the murdered Zoe and this breaks a part of him. He is aware of Krista but has no idea why she is appearing at places he frequents. He believes that Eddie Diehl, Krista's father, murdered his mother. Aaron and Krista come from different sides of the track. Aaron is part Seneca Indian and there is a lot of prejudice against his people in their small town of Sparta, N.Y. There is one scene where Aaron finds himself Krista's savior and the profundity of love, cruelty and pain is described in a poignant and almost revolting manner.Oates does a wonderful job of describing the pain that children endure when they grow up in addicted families. Both Eddie Diehl, Zoe and Delray Kruller are alcoholics and drug addicts and their children live with shame, secrecy and silence as they harbor a loyalty to their parents - - no one must know what goes on inside the home. At the same time, they become what is known as `parental children', children who parent the adults. As Aaron says \"He'd been an adult for as long as he could remember, before even Zoe had died. Only vaguely could Krull recall a boy - - a little boy named `Aaron' - - on the far side of Zoe's death as in a shadowy corner of the house on Quarry Road\". (p.357) . Not only do Aaron and Krista lose their childhoods to the ravages of addiction, Aaron feels that this has become his legacy.\"Headed to hell after her. Drinking beer till his head buzzed and his gutwas bloated like something dead and swollen in the water thinking howit was so, Zoe had plunged into hell and was pulling them after her likedirty water swirling down a drain. The kind of family situation, youcould call it an inheritance, you'd naturally need to get high and stayhigh as long as you could.\" (p. 364)This is a powerful book, not a light read. It is a book about despair, pain, longing, betrayal, addiction and cruelty. It is a book about life on the edges of the precipice where the characters are holding on by the mere strength of their fingertips. It is a book with brilliant insight and a riveting narrative."}, {"userName": "notgettingenough ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2658311-notgettingenough", "userReview": "This book has done the unforgivable.

Estranged from her husband, she had been living in squalid semi-prostitution, and the feeling among the shabby-genteel townspeople, who are a little too close to Zoe's milieu for empathy or compassion, is that she somehow got what she deserved. The police investigating the crime are certain she died at the hands of her lover or her ex-husband. When the investigation stalls over lack of evidence, however, the murder remains unsolved, effectively casting the families of those involved into an endless purgatory of suspicion.The fallout from the unhappy woman's demise falls largely on the shoulders of Aaron, her anomic son, and Krista Diehl, the daughter of the local roustabout with whom Zoe was having an affair. Both children believe that the other's father is responsible for the murder, setting up crosscurrents of sin and stain that reverberate throughout the narrative, which jumps back and forth across the passage of two decades in the lives of these death-haunted characters.This is a powerful novel. Oates's feel for the rhythms of hardscrabble life and its sour mix of alcoholism, suicide, drug abuse, adultery and murder is as keen as ever. In Sparta she has created a fictional universe to stand beside Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County or Cheever's Shady Hill. Her descriptions of the geography of urban decay -- the rusted bridges, tangled back alleys and trash-strewn lots -- are as vivid as any naturalist's portrayal of more felicitous scenes. Her unsentimental language makes a high-lonesome kind of poetry out of otherwise sordid and unremarkable circumstance.ad_iconThis is not to say that \"Little Bird of Heaven\" is without flaws; its pacing is, shall we say, stately, and at times the author lingers over descriptive passages that could have been dispatched more crisply. A book that starts out as a standard police procedural but fizzles into uncertainty and stasis may be realistic, but it will frustrate readers with more conventional expectations.By now, however, most readers probably have settled ideas about Oates anyway, and \"Little Bird of Heaven\" is unlikely to change any minds. Despite her long and prestigious career, in certain circles she suffers from the perception that her superheated realism is not sufficiently literary or experimental. There are three reasons for this canard:The first is the staggering volume of Oates's output. While some of her work can feel either rushed or recycled, it is worth noting that James, Thackeray, Dickens and Trollope, to name a few, produced an equivalent amount of fiction. But critics, especially male ones, are in love with the idea of the author as heroic artiste, a reclusive mystic whose triumphal verbal artifacts are the product of a decade or more of tortured cogitation. This is a purely 20th-century invention. The idea that writing is a craft, that it is work and, like baking or washing dishes or painting houses, can be done daily and well, is anathema to the hoary \"great man\" theory of literature.The second reason for the disdain Oates sometimes provokes is that she eschews postmodernism gamesmanship, and it is difficult to think of a writer less burdened with irony -- the kudzu vine of contemporary fiction. Fashion aside, novels like \"Little Bird of Heaven,\" with its mixture of the Gothic and the fatalistic, mark Oates as our closest contemporary analogue to Hawthorne: lyrical, moral, unforgiving.And finally, there's the poverty, economic and intellectual, of Oates's subjects. Like everyone else, literary critics enjoy reading about characters who resemble themselves, but Oates's narratives are markedly free of eccentric academics, hipster smart-alecks and entry-level publishing ingenues. For Raymond Carver or Cormac McCarthy to write scenes with unshaven characters drinking from the bottle in boardinghouse rooms with stained and faded floral wallpaper registers as noble and bitter and true. To do so as a woman, as a spiritual descendant of Austen and Woolf and Wharton, however, looks to the inflexible-minded as slightly out of focus, as though she were slumming or trying to be something she's not. But Oates's refusal to write soggy family sagas or dating-life confessionals is its own form of toughness. What else would you expect her to do? She's the original Girl From the North Country.

Little Bird of Heaven, unfortunately, is one of the latter. A disappointment, as when Oates centers her tales in upstate New York, she usually evokes both setting and character effectively. This novel fails particularly in creating sympathetic and convincing characters. Oates device of repetition which normally works well, is intrusive here. The magic she oft-times operates in immersing the reader in the story, is absent.

Blonde was my first book by her and it was such an eye-opener for me. Her writing totally blew me away - and still does to this day. Her books are never easy, they are never nice and pleasant but they are important and interesting - and oh so well-written. She does this things with italics, telling us things her characters don't know, letting us know what the characters think when they look back etc.This is not her best book - but it's still very good. This is a book about a murder. A woman in town is strangled in her bed - the general opinion is that it's either by her husband or her lover. No one is able to prove that either man did it so the whole town just suspects one or the other - or both. These two men are actually really similar. Both are men who are used to getting what they wanted, laying down the law - and putting people in their places if anybody dares speaking up against them. Both men have kids.And these kids are the protagonists in this book. The woman's lover has a daughter and the husband has a son - who is also the son of the murdered woman. The books are split into three parts. The first part deals with the girl. We follow her from she's a young girl till she's a young woman. How it is to grow up under this suspicion, how her mother and father are divorced and how much she suffers from this. She loves her father - her drunken bullying father - even though she's scared of him. Oates details this so well.The second part is about the boy. He is a big boy, part Indian. He's the one who finds his mother lying killed in her bed. He's the one who has to live with the entire town suspecting that his father did it. He's the one who covered for his father and told police that he was home that night.Both kids have rather similar lives. They go through much of the same stuff and they know of each other, and later get to know each other under rather unfortunate circumstances.These separate but intertwining stories take up most of the book. We see how devastating the suspicion is for both children, how their and their families lives are ripped apart because of this - even though neither man is convicted.Then for the third part, the two go together to see an old acquaintance. A woman who might be able to shed some light on what happened all those many years before.Oates does what she does so well. She tells most of the events in the book in the first few pages but then she tells it again and again, each time with a little more depth, a little more detail - or from another point of view so we with each new retelling get a better understanding of what really happened - and who did it. The book jumps back and forth between the now and the then, with the added bonus of the characters' gained knowledge over the years.You have to be a really great reader to keep your readers captive when you basically reveal all in the first few pages - and she is. I would have been okay with never knowing who did it because the rest of the book and the writing was that good - even though I've read better by Oates. But of course, when you write at least a new novel each year, sometimes the books only get four stars."}, {"userName": "Mochizuki", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2435459-mochizuki", "userReview": "Little bird of heaven is a definitely a mystery type of book. This book takes place in Sparta, a fictional town in upstate New York. The novel is based off of the unsolved murderer of Zoe Kruller, a bluegrass singer with a reputation for sleeping around. After she was strangled in bed, the police repeatedly detained and interrogated her estranged husband, Delray Kruller, and her married lover, Eddy Diehl. The two men are names \"prime suspects\" in the local paper, but are never taken to trial. But Eddy Diehl's son, Aaron insisted that his father was with him the night of the murderer, making this Diehl's alibi. But the book isn't primarily about the murdered, it is between Eddy's daughter, Krista, and Delray and Zoe's son, Aaron, both try to make sense of what really happened and trying to prove each of their fathers innocence. Throughout the book, Krista is persistent on her father's innocence but sooner than later she starts remembering things and putting pieces together that make her realize that her father could have possibly committed this crime. She starts remembering times she came home early from school and found her father and his mistress alone. But Krista loves her father too much to admit anything bad about him. She is blinded by him and his charisma. At one point in the book her father goes to Krista's high school interrupting her basketball practice and steals her away in his car. At first of course Krista is just na\u00efve about it and thinks nothing of it, but then he points a shotgun at her. On the other side there is Aaron, who is a heartbreaking character. When his mother left his father she left him too. He's big and angry and dark. He had the bad luck to find his mother's strangled corpse, her skull pounded. When Zoe's killer is finally revealed, the truth is useless. As a turning point in a mystery, it falls flat. But for Aaron and Krista, who have been waiting so long to know whether their fathers were murderers, it matters deeply. In the final chapters there is a completely new Krista. She is now a paralegal working on behalf of incarcerated men, trying to establish their innocence. Like her father, her clients are killers by reputation, strong and tough but poor and inarticulate. In some ways, what happened to Krista's dad still defines her. But she has also left town, made something of the tragedy. Her voice has matured as well, grown more controlled, less na\u00efve. When she reunites with Aaron, while their physical pull is as intense as ever, she recognizes \"something impersonal, anonymous\" and predatory in the way he touches her, and knows she should get out while she can. I liked this book, but at the same time I didn't. I thought it was a little too much. There is a very disturbing scene about Aaron saving Krista from being raped but then he sexually assaults her himself. Which was a little weird? But overall it was a book filled with mysteries and excitement. For example her father definitely did not come off as a murder in the beginning of the book, at least to me he didn't and then he ended up kidnapping his own daughter at one point. So the major change in characters was good I liked that."}, {"userName": "Laurel-Rain", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1402123-laurel-rain", "userReview": "In Joyce Carol Oates's latest novel, \"Little Bird of Heaven: A Novel,\" the brutal slaying of Zoe Kruller, a young wife and mother, forms the central core to the story, with two major suspects: her estranged husband, Delray Kruller, and her long-time lover, Eddy Diehl.Diehl's daughter Krista and Kruller's son Aaron become obsessed with each other, as, over the years, nobody is charged with the slaying, the murder goes unsolved, and each young person believes the other's father is guilty.\"Told in halves in the very different voices of Krista and Aaron,\" this tale shines a light on intense sexual love, the anguish of loss, and tenderness that is barely distinguishable from cruelty.We meet the characters who play key roles in the underworld of drugs and crime, while glimpsing the vulnerabilities of each.In the end, the secret of who actually killed Zoe Kruller is revealed, but it is almost anticlimactic. By then, so much misery has consumed and ruined the lives of some of the major players, leaving them empty and washed up. After years apart, when Krista and Aaron finally meet again for the big reveal, they are going through the motions.

She describes the look and feel of the highways, housing and bleak winter of Sparta, NY, perhaps a typical upstate small town. More importantly, she writes of the people who live there and the lives they make.Here she tackles the aftermath of a heinous murder. She writes of its effect on the families of two men whom society has judged as guilty. These families had troubles before their big \"trouble\" began. Both families were severed by drugs and adultery. One family had the added burden of violence and family and societal views of inter-cultural marriage.There are secrets in small towns. Some are open and others buried way down. There are informal power structures in small towns and there are some people who live above the law. This book describes the wreckage caused by the self preservation of people inside and outside the system.I have to admit, were this not JCO, I would not have stayed with it. Somewhere before page 158 I started to wonder if I really cared about this story. It was a relief when in Chapter 17 a new element is introduced and the story really begins.There are parts I'd have preferred were pruned. The basketball games, or Krista's phone call and French fries in the bar with Dad, or the much later the episode with Claude Loomis are examples of parts that would have been better had they been shorter. The ice cream cone with the weevils in it just did not make sense (where would a proper ice cream bar, as this one seemed to be, have easily available weevils?).

The book shifts from each suspects family and the implications that came from this murder. Although this sounds like a great plot, it isn't. The book was sooooo slow, and by the time I decided maybe I should just give up, I was already on page 100 and figured I should finish it out. Krista acted like such a baby- no 15 year old acts like that with their father, and Aaron was so sexually perverted that it made the book seem not only slow but unrealistic. Not to mention who the murdered actually turns out to be, which I won't spoil for you here (A.) saw it coming, and B.)disappointing)!The only thing this story had going for it was the suspense of who the killer was, which you don't find out until 10 pages before the book ends.

This is a very raw and brutal portrayal of a memorable cast of characters who want to escape the small town despair that hangs over their heads like a chemical haze of toxic gloom. It's almost Shakespearean as the saga unwinds in dark twists and turns. Krista is just a young teen when her dad is accused of murdering the one bright light of Sparta-the charismatic and attractive Zoe Kruller. The fact that he's having an affair with her makes him a prime suspect. This is partly Krista's story of what it's like to be a devoted daughter torn to pieces by her father's descent from family man and good guy to a suspect that's shunned no matter where he turns. The other suspect is Zoe's estranged husband, Delray, who is known for having a temper. Their son, Aaron, plummets into a very dark world as his story parallels Krista's.

It's lovely to know this writer has at least one work of significance, but it does steal the thunder for the story enclosed between the covers.Little Bird of Heaven is the recollection of two families torn apart when a murder happens. One on hand you have Aaron, the son of the murdered woman and a suspected father, on the other you have Krista, the daughter of the main suspect and Aaron's mother's lover.Krista is telling us her story for the most part, maintaining a believe in her father's innocence and a fascination for the murdered woman and her family.Aaron tells us something too, albeit more dark and scary than Krista's memories. He seems to be split into two separate individuals, Aaron and Krull and when he discovers his mothers body, it's mainly Krull talking, which is a mean and vindictive part of his character.Their lives barely touch, mainly in the end when they have to resolve the mystery of Aaron's mother's death.It's slow paced, packed with frantic conversations and heated guilty thoughts. Not much is being resolved in this murder mystery, the overall feeling being lacking in information and certainty. It's dramatic how both the lives of Krista and Aaron take a turn after the murder, both seemingly descending into an abyss of confusion, anger and betrayal.Krista being saved by her father from a dreadful live, whereas Aaron has to try and crawl out of the muck himself.I'm not sure I liked it, I mainly thought Aaron had killed his mother, in a rage, not remembering he did so, but in the end it was neatly enclosed that someone not even mentioned in the novel killed her and both fathers of Aaron and Krista are innocent.The last part, the part of Aaron and Krista together, seems a bit much. It lacks credibility, even the choice of employment of Krista is far fetched, thinking she'd be a little hardened by then. Eventually she does show to be a independent woman, realizing when she's got to walk away, which is a surprise. It's not a novel I'll be remembering for long."}, {"userName": "Krista", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729639-krista", "userReview": "[ The floozy roommate, Jacky, makes a deathbed confession that she knew all along that Zoe had been killed by the owner of the club where she and Zoe worked.

What struck me, as I finished this novel, is what similar worlds Joyce Carol Oates and Stephen King write about. I'm sure some people will be shocked that I wrote that because Oates is a much more literary writer than King, but, when you consider the subject matter that they write about (deeply troubled souls who often meet with grim fates and/or lead tortured existances), there is a surprising amount of common ground.This novel examines the effects on the next generation of having a father who is wrongfully accused of murder. The theme of being wrongfully accused is also picked up again in Krista (the female protagonist's) choice of career in adulthood. (She defends the wrongfully accused.) The story reeks of injustice and missed opportunities. Even the end of the story provides a less than happy ending for both characters, but one that is strangely satisfying to the reader because it is realistic.The novel is intriguing and complex; and the writing is lyrical and multi-layered. Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Mariano Hortal", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377752-mariano-hortal", "userReview": "\"Ave del para\u00edso\" de la gran escritora norteamericana Joyce Carol Oates. Y me encanta empezar con ella porque no paro de recomendarla, no hag\u00e1is caso a los intentos de la editorial actual que la publica de hacernos ver que es un libro romantic\u00f3n a lo \"noraroberts\" o cosillas al estilo... no tiene nada que ver. La muerte de una chica en un pueblo peque\u00f1o de Estados Unidos es el pretexto que la escritora utiliza para mostrarnos al mismo tiempo una cr\u00edtica a la sociedad, la justicia y la incapacidad de olvidar adem\u00e1s hace evolucionar a unos personajes que tienen que seguir un camino de expiaci\u00f3n en sus vidas por las consecuencias de dicha muerte. Es un relato g\u00f3tico, bello, a\u00fan con la violencia y el sexo en muchas ocasiones expl\u00edcito. Finalmente conmovedor, tierno y l\u00edrico y con un estilazo propio de ella. Una joya m\u00e1s de una de las m\u00e1s grandes actuales."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Dec 02, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2453991-becky", "userReview": "So I picked this book up from the library since it was a new book - I'd read one other book by Joyce Carol Oates and liked it, so I figured this would run in about the same vein.I got through about 3 chapters before I was so bored and uninterested that I knew reading the whole thing would be a waste of my time. The first three chapters seem a blend of stream-of-consciousness thinking and memories of the main character, that rather than working together to create a mental picture of the character just seem like broken mirror pieces; you're trying to make them fit but they just don't make sense.Wouldn't recommend this one, although maybe it gets better...I just didn't want to chance it."}, {"userName": "Judyarzt", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5359007-judyarzt", "userReview": "Not as good as most of Joyce Carol Oates's other books. Set in upstate NY with a host of shady characters, two of whom are implicated in the murder of a sordid, but sad drug-addicted woman's murder. The novel focuses more so on the daughter and son of the two men who are suspected by the police of committing the murder. Although the book is not as good as I would have liked, I read it in two days; Oates has a way of drawing the reader into the characters' lives as well as the plot and details of the murder investigation. If you're a Oates' fan, you might enjoy the book, and you will also find familiar themes in it. If you are looking for another good Oates' book, this might not be it, though."}, {"userName": "Sunny Shore", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1124341-sunny-shore", "userReview": "This book was slow, but well written and all came together, woven expertly by JCO. In the end, I liked it a lot and it was very satisfying, looking back at the whole book, written in flashbacks. Eddie Diehl, family man, is handsome and worshipped by his daughter, Krista. He also has a married girlfriend, Zoe, on the side and she is eventually murdered. The story focuses on Krista and Aaron, Zoe's son. There is a lot of repetition but it is easy to immerse yourself in JCO's intense writing. I am a big fan of Oates and I would say this was on the second tier of favorite books, first tier including The Falls and Blonde.

As books in general go, it's a fine effort, but Oates has done much better work. The biggest problem I had with the book was that the first two sections move too slowly at times; we learn more about the daily events of the two main characters' lives than we would need to know to understand them well. Section 3 is brilliant, however, and the ending is just what I'd hoped for: it is beautifully written and brings fulfillment and closure. A fairly good 442 pages that, in my opinion, would have been wonderful if edited to 300 pages or so."}, {"userName": "Estibaliz79", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5020972-estibaliz79", "userReview": "M\u00e1s de una vez he le\u00eddo por ah\u00ed que Joyce Carol Oates es una de esas eternas candidatas al Premio Nobel. \u00bfA qu\u00e9 est\u00e1n esperando?

Set in the mythical small city of Sparta, New York, this searing, vividly rendered exploration of the mysterious conjunction of erotic romance and tragic violence in late-twentieth-century America returns to the emotional and geographical terrain of acclaimed author Joyce Carol Oates's previous bestsellers We Were the Mulvaneys and The Gravedigger's Daughter.   When a young wife and mother named Zoe Kruller is found brutally murdered, the Sparta police target two primary suspects, her estranged husband, Delray Kruller, and her longtime lover, Eddy Diehl. In turn, the Krullers' son, Aaron, and Eddy Diehl's daughter, Krista, become obsessed with each other, each believing the other's father is guilty.   Told in halves in the very different voices of Krista and Aaron, Little Bird of Heaven is a classic Oates novel in which the lyricism of intense sexual love is intertwined with the anguish of loss, and tenderness is barely distinguishable from cruelty. By the novel's end, the fated lovers, meeting again as adults, are at last ready to exorcise the ghosts of the past and come to terms with their legacy of guilt, misplaced love, and redemptive yearning.", "title": "Little Bird of Heaven", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6304165-little-bird-of-heaven", "average": 3.33, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1517575538l/6304165.jpg", "reviews": 372, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3524.Joyce_Carol_Oates", "name": "Joyce Carol Oates"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6304165-little-bird-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11181544-uccellino-del-paradiso", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7771727-little-bird-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13404428-ave-del-para-so", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8263022-little-bird-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10726131-little-bird-of-heaven", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5204.We_Were_the_Mulvaneys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15967.The_Falls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15972.The_Gravedigger_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15975.Blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/156222.Foxfire"]}
