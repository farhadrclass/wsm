This book wasn't what you thought it was. This book has always not been what you thought it would be.I felt like there were two books in White Tears, but the final, can't stop reading for anything 50 pages force the halves into sides A and B of the record, completing each other, forming a whole, forcing me to appreciate more of what had come before. Early parts are occasionally irritating but gave me enough interest as we come to know Seth and Carter and Carter's sister Leonie, get background on their backgrounds, are introduced to their passions and the personal demons that follow each of them are hinted it. Seth and Carter have graduated from a liberal arts college: Seth is our narrator, a somewhat spineless, introverted guy with a prior psychotic break in high school, and he marvels at and is made important by his friendship with rich Carter Wallace who seemingly has the world on a string and anything and everything available to him, but who is ashamed of his wealth and privilege (though not above using both carelessly and thoughtlessly) and is endlessly searching for something that will help him feel, connect, be a more authentic version of himself. Their shared love for the world of sound bind them, and then Carter's obsession with blues and preserving and recreating that music fuses Seth to him more firmly.Then something dramatic occurs - no spoilers here, better to go in a bit unprepared and green - and Kunzru shifts the ground beneath the reader's feet. It's hard to say and probably will change depending on the reader, but you'll find either the book goes off the rails, or the book finally gets onto the track it needed to be on. For me, it seemingly takes a horrifying acid trip that blurs and transcends the boundaries of time and ends up shrouded in darkness. It's disquieting, uncomfortable, violent, surreal. And it reaches its most critical, important moments in those final pages that tie what came before together, the past we can't escape and can't form to our will, no matter if we long to escape it or are obsessed with it as a more authentic, real time. While the early parts of the novel indeed invoke and discuss, American white privilege, there's an absence of black voices or authority or agency. At first I thought this was a miss on Kunzru's part, and was beginning to grow tired of the ignorance and tacit ownership Seth and Carter assume. But it turns out that erasure of the black perspective was a deliberate choice, and it comes back with a (literal and figurative) vengeance in the second half, a stinging indictment of past transgressions and present structure that perpetuates white appropriation of black culture, white exploitation of black bodies: once as slaves, then as sharecroppers and work release for petty misdemeanors, now feeding the coffers of private prisons and white wardens and owners, black bodies fueling the engine of a broken criminal justice system. And we, watching Seth, let Kunzru take us from the early perspective:\nWe really did feel that our love of the music bought us something, some right to blackness, but by the time we got to New York, we'd learned not to talk about it. We didn't want to be mistaken for the kind of suburban white boys who post pictures of themselves holding malt liquor bottles and throwing gang signs.\nTo later:\nOn your record deck, you played the sound of the middle passage, the blackest sound. You wanted the suffering you didn't have, the authority you thought it would bring. It scared you, but you thought of the swagger it would put in your walk, the admiring glances of your friends. Then came the terror when real darkness first seeped through the walls of your bedroom, the walls designed to keep you safe and dreaming. And finally your rising sense of shame when you admitted to yourself that you were relieved the walls were there. The shame of knowing that you would do nothing, that you would allow it all to carry on.\nKunzru's writing is quite fine, very readable even in the acid trip half of the book, with for me quite a few revelatory phrases and ideas, and some great descriptive elements. But it's that unsettling feeling and atmosphere that shook me and will stay with me. His writing explicitly and implicitly invokes the crossroads, the fine dividing line, between life and death, between sanity and madness, between existence and erasure, the various devils that serve us and take hold of us and master us. It's hard for me to rate this book: I ran through myriad reactions. But a few hours after finishing it, I am still unsettled, still disquieted, still satisfied by the weaving of the narrative and the force of the message about black erasure in our past and present. It may weigh on my mind in the most disturbing way possible for awhile. So I'll go with 4 stars. It's definitely not a book for everyone, it's for sure flawed and sometimes difficult to read but I could not put it down and it ultimately crawled under my skin.-received an ARC on edelweiss, thanks to Knopf"}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Mar 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "3.5 Seth, our narrator is somewhat of a misfit, many are surprised when Carter, the son of a wealthy family, picks him to be his mate, best friend. They share a love of music, and both are avid collectors, though this collecting will soon turn into obsession when Seth, who takes to the streets to record street noises, records part of an old, unheard of song from a black man playing a chess match. Sparking a switch in Carter's brain, he starts searching for lost, blues music recorded from blacks, know by number, recorded on old 78's, and not easy to find. A difficult book to review, it is innovative, imaginative and sometimes frustrating. It starts out innocuously enough, friendship, music, collecting but half way through morphs into something different, stranger shall we say. The past becomes the present, or the present becomes the past as we are taken back to the Jim Crow South. Has all this happened before? There are deaths that propel the novel forward. There is a musician from years before, now dead, but feels the need to be heard. So things become muddled, everything mixing together but all surrounded by the music, the records, the blues. The black culture and their music being approbated by whites, a warning, a telling, a showing. The treatment of blacks in the old South, the obsession of collectors, a friendship between two different young men and a strange twist of fate, are all enfolded within this story.Not for everyone, a challenging read but an interesting one.

The main narrator has a glib and superficial way of describing events, where the very dark currents of the novel are camouflaged for a time, only slipping into view intermittently. The foreshadowing is so subtle that it can be mistaken for misdirection, but it was the perfect way to disarm me in the beginning, and to prevent me from accurately predicting what was in store for me.Music doesn't behave as it should in the novel. This thematic leitmotif--of music not quite behaving as it should--grows more insistent as the book progresses. Music can be soul-felt and soul-revealing, a cry from the past that connects with the present in sometimes-uncanny ways; but the power of music to connect this way, across time, is perverted by the main characters, who are more interested in collecting original 78's than they are in understanding the music or appreciating the artists who created it.The last pages of the novel are heartbreaking and unexpected. Somehow this UK author of Kashmiri and British ancestry has written a scathing indictment of racism in America, approaching the topic in such an oblique way in the beginning that I was not prepared for the message when it came, and was not able to equivocate or hide from it."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56035852-katie", "userReview": "Some books accumulate merit points as they progress; others have a habit of losing them. I'm afraid this fell into the latter category for me. It's set up really well. The narrator is a nerdy guy who goes around recording ambient noise. No one likes him. Until Carter, a cool rich boy, takes a shine to him. Carter doesn't have much time for the digital age. He collects old r&b records, the older and more obscure the better. Carter carries all the ancestral guilt for the base means by which his family has built its colossal fortune. One day the nerdy guy records some street singer singing a blues song neither of them recognise. They upload it onto the internet and resurrect a vengeful ghost. I was really enjoying this. I liked its esoteric quality and I was intrigued by the mystery it sets up. But when he introduces the twist the writing got a little too melodramatic and pretentious for my liking. The author has a bash at evoking a split personality in the manner of Fight Club and American Psycho but for me never pulled it off. I liked it when it occupied a small canvas; the minute it went out into a bigger world I often found myself rolling my eyes."}, {"userName": "J.

There\u2019s a lot going on in White Tears . . . maybe too much.The story starts off well. Two young white men meet in college and make a strong, but unlikely, connection through their shared love of music. Seth, from whose perspective the story is mostly told, is the low income antisocial kid who proves to be great at making equipment and recording with it, but little else. Carter, a charming and handsome trust-fund kid, fancies himself a connoisseur focusing on African American music, the older the better. With Seth\u2019s studio talents hitched to Carter\u2019s money and music tastes, the pair embarks on a journey to create sonic art in New York City.Seth spends his time walking around NYC with a hidden microphone/recorder, capturing busker performances and sampling the sounds of the street. Carter indulges in record collecting, searching out B-sides and rarities that the pair can mix into their productions. As they immerse themselves more in the music world, Seth becomes more focused, and Carter becomes more obsessed. They make a mock-up of an old blues song and credit it to a mystery musician that Carter invents named Charlie Shaw. Then they put the tune on the Internet and watch it disseminate, fooling every listener into thinking their song is a long lost gem from the South. For all the positive attention they receive, some bad hoodoo starts coming their way as well.An old record collector claims Charlie Shaw is real and that the pair has unearthed a great danger. When they contact the elderly man and investigate his claims, tragedy soon strikes and a dark downward spiral into America\u2019s music history begins, one where abuse and theft ran rampant and the rightful futures of genius black artists were denied by racial barriers and widespread bigotry. White Tears is definitely a book of two halves. The first half is enjoyable; great character building for the two mains, plus an exploration of the themes of wealth, privilege, class systems, and cultural appropriation.However, midway through the novel changes gears and the second half suddenly becomes a vehicle for a paranormal-esque thriller/horror tale of revenge that hasn\u2019t been primed properly by the first half. As a result it often doesn\u2019t work very well. There is a shifting of perspectives as well as a shifting of time and place to try and achieve an unsettling back-story that parallels parts of the main story. Instead of tumultuous and disjointed, it comes off confusing and incomprehensive.Within this pinball mechanism of a plot, the novel ricochets toward an end most readers won\u2019t see coming, but that has more to do with increasing incoherence and sudden revelations that come very late in the game. Our suspension of belief is sorely tested by weak plotting and messy mechanics. Furthermore, on the surface it might seem that Kunzru has done his homework, but it becomes apparent that he has never been immersed in music to the degree that he should be writing so in depth about it. People in the music business will sense and spot faults in this novel; the weak grasp of audio engineering, incessant name-dropping, and what amounts to a scratching of the surfaces of studio, music, and production work. There are some interesting ideas, such as radio pioneer Guglielmo Marconi's theory that sound never actually dies (instead continuing on indefinitely, becoming forever quieter and drowned out by newer sounds), but it isn\u2019t enough to keep the idea behind Charlie Shaw\u2019s revenge afloat.There\u2019s no denying that Kunzru can write. His prose has great flow, and the pace of his storytelling has a compelling urgency. Dialogue is mostly on the strong side, and he tackles some tough questions (and even harder answers). But the delivery of his message is heavy-handed and often poorly executed.That being said, this book will receive much positive attention due to the author's pedigree and for taking on the tender subject matter of American cultural appropriation and racism, but that fact remains that this novel staggered under the weight of its own ambitions, and the narrative suffered from its own intentional confusion. When all is said and done, White Tears is a great book to get into . . . but not such a good one to get out of."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36555254-robin", "userReview": "The song that never ends\nA disorienting, uncomfortable, fascinating story that looks like one thing on the surface, but veers off into unexpected places. What begins with a couple of young white guys who are passionate about music from the past, turns into a ghostly tale of scorching revenge.Carter and Seth, living lives of privilege afforded by Carter's wealthy family, start the nightmare when they upload a recording of an unknown blues singer to the internet. They name the singer \"Charlie Shaw\" - a made up name because they don't know who the singer is, as his song appeared surreptitiously on a recording Seth made, though he has no memory of hearing the singing at the time. It attracts attention from online blues aficionados as well as a mysterious collector; it possesses Carter who can think of nothing else. The wheel starts turning in a malevolent direction with deathly results.We go back in time to the 1950's to hear the story of another record collector who is punished severely for his role with Shaw. We return to the present story which is getting more and more strange and involves Carter's sister Leonie. Time is starting to lose its shape. Characters begin to feel the oddest, most intense form of deja vu - often having the feeling that \"I was always walking down this road\" or \"I was always ordering eggs at this diner\", the feeling that this moment is permanent, unalterable, and does not disappear with the ticking hands of the clock.Guglielmo Marconi, the inventor of radio, believed that sound waves never completely die away, that they persist, fainter and fainter, masked by the day-to-day noise of the world. Marconi thought that if he could only invent a microphone powerful enough, he would be able to listen to the sound of ancient times.The idea that sound never stops is captivating - Charlie Shaw's song certainly seemed to bleed through the years. If only there were such a microphone that Marconi described, perhaps the characters in this book would stop to listen to the history of the music they collected, and would learn something.Unfortunately, that's not how the lesson is learned. And it is a bouquet of tough lessons, about racism, about cultural appropriation in regards to black music, about injustices that go back generations. As Seth keeps protesting, \"It wasn't me! It wasn't my fault! It wasn't me who did this to you!\" But Hari Kunzru shows that history belongs to all of us, and some wounds aren't simply healed by time."}, {"userName": "Rosh", "userReviewDate": "Nov 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/67389060-rosh", "userReview": "I can't decide if this book deserves one star or five, so I went for three. It's not a perfect novel, which isn't to say it isn't great. It reads like water while being complicated on the verge of convoluted. Hari Kunzro has written something extremely complex and thoroughly readable, but something is missing. My biggest issue with the novel is pacing. The beginning of the book is much more generous than the end-the extreme change that the book goes through in the last 50 pages is extremely intense. The main character Seth is meant to get lost for the reader, but his loss is so total you miss the character and cannot connect with him at all. It delves into race relations in the United States but it fails to make any revelations. Black suffering is still ornamental, as much as Kunzro tries to give it a real life and texture. There could have been a solid book here in a quieter mode about the passion young people feel for music and the journey that takes. I thought this was going to be that book but I was wrong."}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2228181-jill", "userReview": "What is the connection between the listener and the musician? Does it matter that one of you is alive and one is dead? And which is which?In this brilliant new novel, Hari Kunzru explores these questions. The narrator, Seth, is a dweeby young man who is obsessed with recording sounds during his walks in New York City. One day he happens across an old chess player who is singing a haunting blues song that he can't get out of his mind. He brings the song to Carter, his bestie who comes from an obscenely rich family and has his own obsession with old blues 78s from the 1930s. Together, they \"authenticize\" the song, making it sound like it's the real deal from the birth of the blues, and \"put it out there\", driving collectors mad.In fact, they even name the blues singer: Charlie Shaw.But did Charlie Shaw ever really exist? And if so, why is his ghost so unsettled and what unfinished business does he have? The novel veers from a paen to the blues to the mystery and ghost genres, as time becomes fluid and everything that's happening already happened. As the novel becomes more hallucinatory, the theme of cultural appropriation becomes clearer. One question says, \"The anmes were traded by collectors, but no one seemed to know a thing about them. They were like ghosts at the edges of American consciousness...Things were hidden. Things got lost. Musicians got lost.\"In an important way, the novel is about boundaries: the fluid boundary of time, the boundaries between musician and listener, the so-called living and the so-called dead, white and black, and the Side A and Side B of life (Side A is for the talented; Side B is just a joke for those who understand nothing). For a while, I admired the book enormously, but during the last 50 pages, the admiration turned into real love."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Mar 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "Before writing this review, I HAD to read what others had said to know if it was just me. This feeling of total disconnection and confusion. As so many reviewers have noted, the first half of the book had me; the complexity of relationships with both family and friends; the history of music and what it can mean to people in their search for self; just who is allowed/able to appreciate a specific style or period of art, in this case blues music of the 20s/30s by a (lovingly?) obsessive, rich, white collector; privilege and its lack; attitudes towards and the experience of mental health issues.Then there's a dramatic, defining incident. All of a sudden the tone and content of the book turns. And for me, was lost. It's bizarre and otherworldly, jittery and dark. It felt like the thrashings of a trapped, damaged mind. Other people have seen something in this section that I could not. Yet what is very clear is the talent of Kunzru in his ability to evoke the strange and labyrinthine paths of the mind. I'm not sure whether I disliked the second half of the book because it clashed so much with the first, because it left me with unresolved questions, or because it was so unsettling. All of the above, i'm sure, but I leave it feeling unsure and I don't like it.ARC via Netgalley"}, {"userName": "Jenny (Reading Envy)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68030-jenny-reading-envy", "userReview": "[There is another shift that I'm putting behind a spoiler tag because I didn't see it coming in anything I'd read, and it took a long time to understand.

I started WHITE TEARS knowing Kunzru from some of his previous works and expecting a smart book on race in America.

I don't really separate my genre fiction from literary fiction, and this was yet another excellent book that does both.

It starts simply, but then slowly like the frog in the proverbial boiling water, you find your in some shapeshifting, ghostly fantasy novel and your not entirely sure whats going on. But you don't mind as it is flinging little truth bombs at you and your thinking how did Kunzru pull this highwire act off ?. This is absolutely a novel I could turn around and read over again just to see how he constructed it. It is so easy to glance over those little odd time-slipping moments, just some weird deja vu stuff very cunningly placed while your mostly interested in other aspects. These moments gradually build up into something that you realise was there all along but the implications when the end comes are startling. I am deliberately being vague about plot and character because the joy in reading this for me mostly came from not knowing where this was heading.It is possible I loved this book so intently because I was predisposed to the music. Currently wrestling with the guitar on a daily basis, I appreciated that this novel could also double as a primer in the history of the early blues. I spent so much time listening to Willie Johnson's Future Blues and other old recordings referenced in this novel. You can absolutely hear the influence this Delta blues style has had on modern music and it is a testament to Kunzru skill as a writer that he makes all this old music come alive as well as to use it as a hook to pose questions on cultural appropriation (I delved down an interesting rabbit hole here with The Rolling Stones and Robert Wilkins song Prodical Son which is worth mulling over ) and the dark history that influences the blues style. Making the time to track down some of these songs adds an extra layer of haunting melancholy to the reading experience.White Tears in my opinion absolutely should be discussed with some of the other big-hitting novels of 2017 namely Sing, Unburied, Sing  and Lincoln in the Bardo - all with a similar \"ghostly'' element to them.

The blues got there, it is generally acknowledged, via the adapted rhythms and methods of West African natives enslaved in the American South. One of the blues' most customary components came from the group work songs of the plantation slaves who used the African practice of \"call and response,\" which bluesmen have most often transformed into a conversation between the singer and his guitar. It is no coincidence that the Mississippi delta region so rich in fertile soil for large plantations is the birthplace of a veritable Blues Who's Who, including Muddy Waters, B.B. King, Bo Diddley, Robert Johnson and Howlin' Wolf.In White Tears, novelist Hari Kunzru cleverly and ambitiously bares the wounds from which the blues bled, journeying from Manhattan to the Mississippi delta and from the present to the late 1950s and again to the late 1920s. With sinister strains threaded throughout, his novel scrutinizes white exploitation of black culture, the forced labor of black convicts through convict leasing to white farms (which some call \"slavery by another name\"), and related issues of race, class, poverty and musical authenticity.The novel begins in Manhattan with Seth and Carter, best college buddies rooming together after bonding over a mutual love of black music. Seth recalls how \"Carter taught me to worship--it's not too strong a word--what he worshipped. He listened exclusively to black music because ... it was more intense and authentic than anything made by white people.\" According to Carter's sister, he \"feels guilty for being a rich boy. That's why his heroes are always poor or black.\"As it happens, Carter lives off a trust funded by his family which owns a conglomerate of construction, energy and private prison businesses. So, when the pair decides to open a recording studio, Carter has little problem bankrolling it, with Seth, a sound engineering whiz, managing the business. The talents of these \"audio craftsmen, artisans of analog\" have thrust them to the mat of success with a contract to record a successful white hip hop artist.Seth often adds a variety of sounds to his audio bank by strolling about Manhattan with his parabolic mic and recorder. One afternoon upon playing back the sounds he recorded of nothing in particular near chess players in Washington Square, Seth is shocked to hear a haunting voice singing a blues song:Believe I buy me a graveyard of my ownBelieve I buy me a graveyard of my ownPut my enemies all down in the groundPut me under a man they call Captain JackPut me under a man they call Captain JackWrote his name all down my backCarter pounces upon hearing the recording, and they stay \"up until six in the morning, cleaning up the recording and deciphering the words....\" Carter cooks up a guitar track over which to lay the mystifying voice and asks Seth to \"Make it dirty. Drown it in hiss. I want it to sound like a record that's been sitting under someone's porch for fifty years.\" Carter fakes a \"scuffed and faded\" recording label for a 1928 recording of what he labels \"Charlie Shaw's Graveyard Blues,\" a \"rarity\" that he uploads to the internet. The collector trolls instantly trill. One going by the name \"JumpJim\" drills them about the song and pushes to know what is on side B, saying he has not heard Charlie Shaw's voice since 1959.A suspicious hit and run leaves Carter comatose a third of the way into the novel and the buddy-centric thriller seems, in hindsight, like a bluesy vamp to the main numbers. The story takes an ominous turn into the territory of noir mystery when Seth seeks out the collector to learn about his 1959 trip to Mississippi with an unscrupulous older collector who plucked Charlie Shaw's only recording from Shaw's voodoo-ish sister and of the ominous events leading to that man's shrieking end ablaze among his collection of authentic blues recordings. Seth convinces Carter's sister to accompany him on a trek to the Mississippi delta to sleuth a possible link between the real Charlie Shaw, the counterfeit recording and the hit and run. This nightmare-like journey to the soul of the blues thrums with tension and a droning dread that calamity lurks around the corner. As they approach the delta, the menace intensifies and time starts to tilt.In the novel's final, spectral phase, the past and present merge into a sort of discordant call and response. Time ultimately comes undone. Without giving too much away, readers learn of Captain Jack and how Charlie Shaw never made any more records when all he wanted was \"to pass something on ... to reach forward, to obey the urge of life.\" Seth becomes alienated by circumstance and is shunned by Carter's family. The story pounds with the profane nature of a payback tinged with aspects of the supernatural and voodoo, and the novel ends with a shockingly unforgettable judder.White Tears is a bold, formidable novel that is not for everyone. Yet, the venturesome reader will be rewarded as Kunzru explores the corrupted nature of \"blaxploitation\"; dredges the sordid past of the music from which \"all ... American music derives its most distinctive characteristics\" (James Weldon Johnson); pays tribute to the music's legacy infusing much of our culture today; and, vilifies the vinyl hipsters and their obsession over authenticity in the blues while they disregard the pain integral to the end product."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "[(Besides which, surely a subtler approach would have had far greater impact?

The narrative at some points starts to veer uncontrollably between different times and places. Even identities become blurred, with several characters bleeding into each other (literally and figuratively). At one point, a particular character is no longer sure what color he is.Seth (his name is no accident, I think; Seth was the third son of Adam and Eve, born after they lost Abel) is the narrator and main character. Although at various points he suffers from episodes that could be construed as psychotic, he is a generally honest and reliable narrator.Seth befriends wealthy hipster Carter Wallace in college. They later move to New York and go into the music production business together. Seth also has an unrequited passion for Carter's beautiful artist sister, Leonie. All of these characters are white, which gives the reader a hint about the meaning of the title, which isn't fully revealed until the novel's end.Seth records ambient sound on his travels around the city. One day he plays Carter a recording of a black guy singing a few strange and unexplainable lines after winning an outdoor chess match in Washington Square Park.Carter becomes obsessed with this rough soundtrack, and here the trouble starts.Neither Seth nor the reader have any idea what they are getting themselves into when they start the book.Things quickly devolve into a dark, disturbing, and frightening narrative of nightmarish woe.A major subplot that weaves in and out of the main story involves Chester Bly, an obsessive white collector of old blue records and his much younger coworker, nicknamed Jumpjim. By the time Seth meets Jim and hears his cautionary tale Jim is a very old man.A central theme, of course, is race in America, but the book is about much more.Another theme is old blues recordings, and if you love the blues (think Blind Lemon Jefferson, or Leadbelly for example), this book will be right up your alley. The book elucidates the way white people love and steal black music without any benefit to the black musicians who made the music.I could certainly identify with Seth's feeling of invisibility. He feels that because he is neither rich nor powerful nor handsome, people just ignore him. This is an accurate perception. But..there are lots of other clues that Seth misses, perhaps because his own harrowing tale...and his white privilege...blind him to some extent.I won't say much more to avoid spoilers, except that by the work's end the meaning of the strange song of the chess player is revealed.Highly recommended. It's creepy and scary and brilliantly and lyrically written. Not for the faint of heart though.In fact, I'm surprised this novel and its author aren't better known. Maybe it's the disurbing nature of the book and its themes that have limited its audience. I kind of stumbled on it myself. This is Booker prizeworthy material.P.S.

What I did take from this book is to be wary of novels about rich folks. Rich folks can be boring and treacherous - a deadly combination.And if I ever see another book where the photograph of the author shows him or her striking a pretentious hipster pose, give it a wide, wide berth.I guess those are two worthwhile lessons. That shows me that I can even learn something from a book that I hated.I believe that one intent of this novel was to speak about racism in America.

It's brilliantly-executed on the level of narrative and symbolism. An incredibly layered story about slavery and the prison industrial complex, about black people as property and possessions for the white owners, and draws a line down to record collecting and the music industry in terms of who owns black music. Cultural appropriation as the \"liberal\" form of ownership. And thus this injustice, embedded in the very core of America, can only be addressed to white capitalists via a different kind of \"possession\". It left me reeling; the message was powerful.In thinking about how this book is structured, the question of responsibility in art comes up. To be precise, the ethics of writing a story about the legacy of slavery and black people's suffering when you haven't endured it or are not descended from people who have. Structuring the narrative this way strikes me as a responsible choice on Kunzru's part because the focus, and thus the blame, is rightly on the oppressors, on the people who profit from slavery and prisons. But the depiction of American whiteness in this book is not monolithic; class is a factor in how Seth, the white narrator, is used and abused and discarded.This review doesn't do the book justice.

When Seth captures snippets of a song while travelling the city doing field recordings Carter matches it against a guitar riff recorded elsewhere and they fit perfectly together. The two fuzz it up and pawn it off as a long forgotten blues artist. They fabricate the name of Charlie Shaw and call the frankensteined track Graveyard Blues. When someone reaches out saying they haven't heard Charlie Shaw since 1959 things get a little crazy. What starts off as a biting satire on cultural appropriation turns into a blues ghost story that becomes full-on Korean revenge drama.

I was stunned by his imagination, his complicated world view, and his crackling prose. I have not yet read his earlier novels but I will. As soon as I could get a copy of his new novel from the library, I read it in three sittings.In White Tears, he sets up an unlikely friendship between Carter, a mentally disturbed trust fund kid, and Seth, a withdrawn socially awkward dude who is obsessed with sound. Seth tells this haunted tale and opens with: \"That summer I would ride my bike over the bridge, lock it up in front of one of the bars on Orchard Street and drift through the city on foot, recording. People and places. Sidewalk smokers, lovers' quarrels, drug deals. I wanted to store the world and play it back just as I'd found it, without change or addition.\" (My husband is a recording engineer. I was instantly hooked.)Seth believes that \"every sound wave has a physiological effect, every vibration.\" One day he records a chess hustler in Washington Square singing a line from a blues song. \"Believe I'll buy me a graveyard of my own.\"The connection between Carter and Seth is music. Carter collects old blues records. The two of them listen to them for hours. After college, using Carter's inherited wealth, the two open a recording studio with Carter as businessman and procurer of clients and Seth as audio engineer.Within a few chapters the story takes a weird turn and then just goes into a widening gyre of weirdness. Something very horrific happens to Carter. Seth and Carter's equally deranged sister Leonie, depart for the South on a quest to find the old blues guy who originally recorded \"Believe I'll Buy Me a Graveyard.\" Seth's belief about sound waves and physiological effects leads him into being haunted by that old blues guy.Meanwhile Hari Kunzru leads his readers into a history and meditation on greed, exploitation, race, and the wages of sin. I finished the novel in a quandary. Who owns creativity? How is it that creative types are so often submerged by others who cannot create but can only live off of creatives?Charlie Shaw, the creator of the graveyard song, was a black man. As James Baldwin said, \"It is only in his music...that the Negro in America has been able to tell his story.\" I truly hope Hari Kunzru does not read this review because I even wondered if he, as an author, had exploited black musicians in order to write his novel. I am sure it was not his intention, but how many black musicians had to die to create White Tears?But maybe, just maybe, every sound wave does have a physiological effect, so that a creative named Hari Kunzu, a mixed British/Kasmiri Hindu, could channel the vibrations of a 1920s black blues artist from Mississippi."}, {"userName": "George Jr.", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4825756-george-jr", "userReview": "This is a terrible book. The received stature of the author makes that a surprise, but it is terrible nonetheless.Nothing against the ambition, which boils down to the question of authenticity, what it is and the dangers of pursuing it to the utmost level of purity. The vehicle is old-time American music, from poor Southern musicians, mostly black and mostly blues players, recorded in the 1920s on labels like Paramount. The characters who carry this are Seth (the protagonist) and Carter, buddies from college who use Carter's family money to start a recording studio. They in turn are paralleled by the story of an older record collector and the obsession of one of his colleagues. Both pairs are connected through what is essentially an imaginary song from a pseudonymous musician, Charlie Shaw.Kunzru is woefully unprepared to execute this task. The self-conscious quality of his research is painfully embarrassing throughout: the author picked up details of audio engineering, musicians' names, song titles, and serial numbers, without ever picking up any understanding of the subject. He seems to have never heard the music in question, or it seems to have never penetrated his understanding\u2014he comes off as the collectors themselves, obsessed with the completeness and quality of the physical object and not much interested in the art it contains. Seth and Carter somehow find themselves caring only about old acoustic recordings without ever seeming to find anything in the music that matters to them as human beings (that Kunzru name checks some well-known music writers who are features of the upper middle-class white bourgeoisie and can't hear African-American music past Beyonce is a tell).This all turns into an overwrought poitboiler of sex and murder, with a heaping condescension of the young white man finding, through violence and tragedy, the authentic feeling of being a young black man deep in the Jim Crow South. This is a terrible kind of slumming, Kunzru arguing that Seth has achieved this experience through writing that is nothing more than gazing at (and never putting the needle down on) the shellac grooves on a 78 side. The prose itself has the earnest, focussed, affectlessness that is everywhere now, spawned from countless MFA programs, and that is professionally smooth, bland, and that allows the author to disavow any specific meaning. That is dishonest, and the foundation of this deeply dishonest book."}, {"userName": "jo", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/210397-jo", "userReview": "this is the first book i read -- but surely there must be others, right? please tell me there are others -- that tackles squarely, that is to say front and center, the theme of whiteness in america (C.E. Morgan's The Sport of Kings does so too, but it taints the effort, in my opinion, by devoting almost half the book to a story told from a black man's point of view, which has always been dicey when done by a white author -- see William Styron's Confessions of Nat Turner-- but seems particularly tone deaf now that we are all awakening, or woking up, hopefully). and let me get out of the way that hari kunzru is neither white, black, nor american, having been born in england to an indian father and a white mother, and having lived in the states, with apparently a number of misgivings, for only 10 years. white people have always caused and continue to cause untold misery and often decimation to non-white people, and non-white people have tried to tell us -- the well-meaning us, the decent white folks who wouldn't hurt a fly -- what other us were doing in our name, and we have always done what we could, from sheer acts of heroism to serious political commitment, to gestures of protest and compensation. since a lot of the effort of letting us know has happened in the written form, there are countless books written by non-white people about non-whiteness, including a mammoth chunk of books by american black people about american blackness, and i'm not entirely sure we, even those of us who believe very deeply in equality, make a point of reading them. we of course would benefit much from them, both in terms of literary delight and in terms of learning. and then there are some books written by white people about non-whiteness, including books written by american whites about blackness, and those are a bit disturbing and a bit wrong and for the most part misguided, cuz, dear white people, why do you write about blackness instead of writing about whiteness? white is a race too you know?but since white is perceived, or non-perceived, by most of us as the default of humanity -- meaning, there are people and they are assumed to be white and if they are not you point it out -- very few white people know how to write about whiteness as a race. in fact, if my personal experience of reading is anything to go by (and i sure hope it isn't!), no one does!hari kunzru jumped bravely into this breach and let me dispel immediately any notion that his book is boring and didactic cuz it most certainly is not. it's a riveting ghost story about music, love, wealth, music, music, and the troubled, unreciprocated love of white people for black culture. in an illuminating interview with CBC kunzru explicitly says that this book is a tribute to, and maybe an offspring of, BLM (if you don't know what this stands for please google it and read some of what comes up, cuz if you don't know what BLM is you will not understand this book, including its title). as i read this riveting, painful and woundrous book i kept thinking, wow kunzru is really magic to have written a book that in some ways is a thesis (the thesis being, white people tread all over blackness without noticing it, and then take ALL THE CREDIT for whatever good comes to them from using black work and culture) and make it fun! but then i realized that this thought was a direct product of the fact that this is the first novel i read that puts american whiteness and its shame front and center. cuz, really, isn't every book the carrier of a thesis, if you want to make it such? so this book is, yes, built around a thesis, but most importantly it's built around a story, and the story will keep you on the edge of your seat. it is the story of charlie shaw, an early blues musicians, a guitar maverick, and of a nichey but sizable group of (white, default) record collectors who are on the hunt for his (one?) recording. all sorts of trouble ensues. ghosts show up and enter the body of people, as ghosts sometimes do, and make them do terrible things which are only the things that were done to them. but these people get away with it cuz they are white and not black, and white gets passes all the time, everywhere, daily, and we don't even know it. and the white people in the world cry a lot, from sorrow and a profound sense of injustice, and their tears are white, just like the color of their skin."}, {"userName": "switterbug (Betsey)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2843912-switterbug-betsey", "userReview": "This extraordinary novel takes place in different time periods, and from NYC to the American South, spanning about 80 years that run fluidly together in a dreamscape-terrorscape. Like Gods Without Men, you have to let go of pre-conceived notions of temporal events and just go with the flow. It starts off with a straightforward narrative in contemporary NYC and then, eventually, dissolves into a prism of ghosts that superimpose the past onto the present. As the history of a bigoted South is resurrected, Kunzru\u2019s landscape heralds an inescapable future. Events are juxtaposed and connected in a stream-of-consciousness text that makes more and more sense the further you progress with the story.Carter Wallace is a privileged white trust fund baby, scion of a conglomerate whose sinister tentacles hide some dark business matters. But Carter likes to claim that he disinherited himself from his family. He collects vinyl records of old black blues music, and, as he gets older and more sophisticated about music, focuses on rare pre-war recordings from around 1928-1941. His obsession with black music lay in his belief that it was \u201cmore authentic and intense than anything made by white people.\u201d Seth is a middle-class suburban student who meets Carter at a small liberal arts college. Seth had been producing audio recordings since high school, such as loops of his breathing, the sounds of floorboards creaking, leaves rustling, the hiss and crackle of his surroundings. They team up as connoisseurs of analog sound engineering, and with Carter\u2019s money, they buy esoteric equipment from the pre-digital era and achieve expertise in sound production. Their preoccupation with audio becomes a rapidly growing business, and they are hired out by musicians/bands looking to add production values to their recordings. According to Seth:\u201cI was trying to hear something in particular, a phenomenon I was sure existed: a hidden sound that lay underneath the everyday sounds I could hear without trying.\u201d Carter was seeking the perfect rare record, or song, but Seth sought a more abstract otherness from analog recording, \u201c\u2026a past version of the future, temperamental, unstable, half-alive.\u201dOne day, while recording various sounds, Seth comes home to realize he had inadvertently recorded some blues lyrics sung by one of the chess players in Washington Square, and old black man whose face was obscured to him. The voice was mesmerizing, electrifying, with the ability to make one word into three tones, \u201cthe middle one spiking into a piercing falsetto buzz.\u201d After sharing the recording with Carter, his partner insisted that Seth use his technical talent to clean it up in order to clarify all the lyrics, and then dirty it down to make it sound like it had been buried and forgotten under someone\u2019s porch for half a century. Carter hectored Seth into producing it for the collectors market, and even made up a false name for the singer--Charlie Shaw. But something about the recording was disturbing to Seth, and the finished product sounded like \u201cthe kind of recording that only exists in one poor copy, a thread on which time and memory hang.\"The description I shared above is in the early pages of the book, and sets the stage for a remarkable drama that unfolds ultimately in a surreal latter half, which Kunzru masterfully controls. The opening segues to the thrust of the story, most of which I am leaving out for the reader to discover. Narrated alternately in the first person, the reader is transported to a former time and place that is continuous and connected to all that comes after. The narrative is an alchemy\u2014no, a vivisection, of genres. Literary fiction; murder mystery; racial exploration; and a hint of dystopian, inverted. Have you ever walked into an ancient church or basilica in Rome? I am secular (and so is Kunzru), but it isn\u2019t religion that I feel in these churches; it is the echoes of continuous and collective pain, prejudice, suffering, love, compassion, endurance, guilt, oppression, and humanity. It\u2019s all there between the walls, in the vapor, the perpetual voices long gone, shattered, but still heard. That is what I feel when I read Kunzru--a timeless echo of voices from the past, permeating the future. We are all connected and separate, islands of ourselves but bound infinitely in our memory and consciousness. \u201cSlip, drop it, and that memory lies in pieces.

They create a fake song, putting together two halves of sound, one discovered by Seth who walks the streets of the city recording everything as he goes.

If this sounds melodramatic, I suppose that's because the book might be considered that if it weren't so brilliantly performed.The past and the present slip into each other and the reader is bounced between the two, sometimes between sentences until it's impossible to situate oneself in either time period, difficult even to keep track of where you are.

Kunzru spares no details as he delves into heavy descriptions of the sound editing process and audio engineering. He name-drops. His characters contemplate music theory ad nauseum. It felt unnatural, like the author was ever-present behind the narrative, showcasing his impressive amount of research into the subject matter. The book would have been stronger without it.I also agree completely with other readers who noted that this is a book of two VERY different halves. The first half is much more palatable and enjoyable, even with the addition of the aforementioned info-dumping. This first half explores wealth, privilege and class, developing the two main characters - Seth and Carter - and their fascination obsession with vintage blues music. White Tears is essentially about the very real dangers of cultural appropriation as two twenty-something white hipsters play around in the world of black music. When Seth records a random singer in a park with a beautiful blues-y voice, Carter puts it online and claims it is a long-lost vintage blues recording by the made-up Charlie Shaw. In a strange turn of events, a collector contacts them saying the recording and musician are actually real.This is where the book is strongest. Kunzru shines a light on the extent of Seth and Carter's privilege, firstly emphasizing how Carter's economic prosperity aids him, but then also showing the ways in which Seth gains as a white man capitalizing on a black man's music (whether fictional or not). It takes steps toward exploring the tumultuous history of black music in America but, unfortunately, this is where the book goes, um... completely nuts.The second half of the book reads like a random stream of nonsense. The author quickly switches to a tale that is perhaps supernatural, maybe nonsensical, definitely confusing, and it is extremely jarring. I don\u2019t think I ever quite got back into the book. Is Charlie Shaw real? Is ANYTHING real?! It becomes ever more rambling and incoherent before finally sort of being pulled together in the last fifty-ish pages. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s enough to excuse the amount of time I felt completely disconnected and baffled. White Tears totally lost me on its spiral into bizarroland. It\u2019s almost like the author vomited random words onto the page and the reader is left to decide whether they see something deep in said word vomit, or nothing at all. I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m mostly in the latter camp.Part of me wants to rate this book higher because there were good parts.

White Tears is a ghost story, a terrifying murder mystery, a timely meditation on race, and a love letter to all the forgotten geniuses of American music.", "title": "White Tears", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30780283-white-tears?from_choice=true", "average": 3.69, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1473185233l/30780283.jpg", "reviews": 841, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/66252.Hari_Kunzru", "name": "Hari Kunzru"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Horror", "Literary Fiction", "Music", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30780283-white-tears", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34832436-white-tears", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32736671-white-tears", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32489964-white-tears", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31379291-white-tears", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11076138-gods-without-men", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/114447.The_Impressionist", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/429653.Transmission", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1458234.My_Revolutions", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18052460-memory-palace"]}
