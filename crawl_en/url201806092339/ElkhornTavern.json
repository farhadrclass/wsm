The fact that they lived at all is marked only in tiny, forgotten clusters of scarred headstones scattered among the hickory groves and oak ridges of that land, but their progeny are still there.\"I decided to include the author\u2019s dedication in my review, since after reading this outstanding book I am truly in awe of these unknown women who sacrificed much, including their personal safety and their property, in order to hold onto the bits and pieces they could still call their own. Elkhorn Tavern tells the story of one such fictional family, the Hasfords, who represent a slice of history that was far from familiar to this reader at least. All war fiction is gripping, in my opinion, but Civil War stories in particular are so poignant when we see how neighbors and even relatives were often pitted against one another. This novel is no exception, and Douglas C. Jones\u2019s storytelling abilities are superb. I was engrossed in the story from start to finish.Ora Hasford\u2019s husband, Martin, has gone off to fight with the Confederates. The Hasfords live in the northwest section of Arkansas, just a few miles from the border of Missouri. Martin was not a supporter of slavery, yet he chose to fight for the South. \"He was still steadfast against human bondage, yet he saw a bitter wickedness in outsiders trying to tell anyone how they should run their affairs. Although he would never own a slave himself, neither would he ever think of dictating his views to another man.\" Ora has been left behind to run the farm with the help of her two children, Roman, aged fifteen, and Calpurnia, aged seventeen. Perhaps Martin would have stayed home had he known that his little family would soon be in the midst of a bloody yet little-known battle, The Battle of Pea Ridge, in 1862. Not only that, the Hasfords find themselves threatened by bands of marauders, as the troops leave behind a land devastated and with little protection. Ora and her children are visited by some very unwelcome guests, as well as by one mysterious injured man who is lucky that the Hasfords put compassion and duty before political beliefs. The battle scenes are absorbing and oftentimes as gruesome as one would expect, but without being gratuitous. The characters are expertly developed; Jones breathes life into every single one, even the minor ones. Roman is the \u2018typical\u2019 adolescent, wanting to show his brawn and maturity and angering when he feels his mother and sister don\u2019t value him as the man he believes himself to be. When he sees firsthand the reality of war, he realizes that fighting is not necessarily a privilege and the glory he once believed it to be. Calpurnia is a bright young woman who has always respected her mother, but this respect quickly turns to awe when she notes the real strength behind her mother\u2019s quiet ways. What a competent and upstanding woman we see in Ora Hasford \u2013 and one that you would be well-advised not to torment! I don\u2019t know who could fail to admire her. \"Calpurnia knew she would never again look at her mother without feeling her indomitable will.\" Just the sort of woman you need around in a tight spot. Of course, I can\u2019t forget to mention Tulip Crozier, \"a shrewd old man who knew how to make ends meet and who was sometimes a little strange.\" A penchant for whiskey as well as some other quirks might turn off some folks, but he was a true friend to the Hasfords. And then there\u2019s Spider Epp \u2013 the misfit, the ignored, the despised. He\u2019ll seek his revenge by aligning himself with the wrong crowd. This book was a complete surprise. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Civil War historical fiction, as well as just plain good storytelling. It\u2019s going on my favorites shelf, and it won\u2019t be long before I pick up a copy of Jones\u2019s The Barefoot Brigade which tells Martin Hasford\u2019s story as a soldier for the Confederate army. \"It would never make an epic story, like those great struggles in the east \u2013 Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Shiloh, Cold Harbor. But for these men, coming across the eastern spur of Pea Ridge, it would last forever in memory because they had survived it.\""}, {"userName": "Zoeytron", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12656534-zoeytron", "userReview": "It's a terrible thing when your home is no longer a safe haven. On a small farm in northwest Arkansas, Ora Hasford has her hands full trying to run the farm with only the help of her 15 year old son and her 17 year old daughter. Father is away, fighting in the war. The farm is down to two old horses, a milk cow, some chickens, and an ill-tempered mule who is just as likely to take a chomp out of your backside as not. Still and yet, they have more than most folks. The bloody Battle of Pea Ridge takes a heavy toll on everyone in the area. Remnants from both sides remain all too close. Worse still are the marauding bands of bushwhackers and Jayhawkers, who rob and pillage indiscriminately and burn what they can't carry off with them, leaving fear and misery in their wake. It is a time and place with no order, no authority. Ora Hasford doesn't mince words and she doesn't cotton to those who do. She is as tough as an old hickory stick, and is apt to meet uninvited callers at the door with an ax in hand. She has no compunction about using it to protect her family and what little they have managed to keep. Excellent slice of the time, the hardships endured, and the area where it all took place."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "This is a well-crafted novel of a family in northeast Arkansas caught up in early Civil War turmoil typical of the border state. This means communities close to transient skirmishes and battles between the two armies and, in between, prey to ravages by roving bands of violent human locusts known as jayhawkers and bushwackers. The former being gangs that claimed affinity with the Union and the latter to the Confederacy, but often tended to terrorizing and pillaging any civilian population that got in their way. The story is of a family of subsistence farmers of German immigrant origin, a woman and teenaged son and daughter, and their resilience in dealing with the violence and chaos of the war around them while the father is away in the Confederate Army. I loved the way the characters developed and took heart in their engagement of people in the community to work together with them to ride out this madness. The mother, Ora Hasford, rises to the task of keeping the wolves at bay from the four sets of dangerous people with guns. Roman, fifteen, is so awkward and inarticulate, but his awakening to a role of helping keep the family safe begins to turn around his more self-centered urges to break free of the family to become a man. His older sister, Calpurnia, seventeen, talks circles around him and constantly embarrasses him with her taunting. He can never communicate his caring for her, but she knows it. Various factions passing through rob them of livestock and food, and the threat of rape and murder brings the family together. It\u2019s the \u201cirregular\u201d forces that are the most treacherous, as they enlist people from their community. A particularly nasty kid, a cobbler in the nearby village of Leetown, uses his Union sympathies to act on his hate for Ora and anger over rejected lust for Calpurnia, directing the jayhawkers to oppress them. Suddenly, active war comes to this remote Ozark community. About 10,000 Union forces under Brigadier General Curtis move in from Missouri in March 1862, and set up defenses along Little Sugar Creek and Pea Ridge, with headquarters at the Elkhorn Inn, located on the main road north and a mile away from the Hasford farm. From Fort Sumter and Bull Run in the east to Wilson\u2019s Creek in Missouri, the Confederate\u2019s string of victories made Curtis particularly eager to match General Grant\u2019s success in taking of a couple of key river forts in Tennessee. Major General Van Dorn, overall commander of the Trans-Mississippi District, is equally eager to consolidate the hold on Missouri against by turning back this incursion into Arkansas and potential doorway to Alabama. He brings his army of about 14,000 up the road from Fayetteville under General Sterling Price of Missouri and Benjamin McCulloch of Texas, splitting half off a bypass road around the backside of Pea Ridge. Attack from the north catches Curtis off guard, and they relinquish Elkhorn Tavern. Despite superior numbers, the Confederates gambled speed for limited supplies and the Union forces, backed by superior artillery, eventually force Curtis to retreat, with the butcher\u2019s bill of about 1,300 casualties for the North and 2,000 for the South. As a result, Missouri stayed in the Union and Grant had less worry about a flank attack as her worked down the Mississippi valley toward Vicksburg.The narrative puts you into the battle around the Elkhorn (called either the Battle of Pea Ridge or of Elkhorn Tavern) based on the perspective of Roman and of other civilians at hand who work at the inn and the nearby mill. The Hasford farm is used as part of the line of defense by the Union soldiers. Their cobbler nemesis, out helping guide the Union forces, gives us the perspective on fighting around Pea Ridge. After the exciting portrayal of the battle is over, life has to go on with grave depravations and the ongoing dangers from the irregular marauders. A slave suddenly freed by the evacuation of the inn\u2019s owners and the old man who runs the mill take some initiative to help the Hasford family when they take in of a seriously wounded Union officer. Their mercy and struggle to help him recover makes them a target of both pro-Union and Confederate factions. The growing affection between Calpurnia and this man drives a wedge between Roman, who sees the officer as an enemy, and Ora, who sees him as honorable despite his membership with the invaders from the North. They will all have to work together to meet the dangers coming their way. Extra help comes from surprising people, such as a Cherokee hiding out in the woods nearby after deserting from the Union Army.In the end I got the same great pleasure I reaped from other more well-known books about families in the Civil War, such as \u201cCold Mountain\u201d, \u201cCoal Black horse\u201d, \u201cWoe to Live On\u201d, and \u201cSweetsmoke\u201d. I owe it to Howard for turning me toward this author of some 16 novels of historical fiction, who seems unfairly neglected in readership. This one, published in 1980, has only 111 ratings and 8 reviews. Yes, I could be biased because of particular fondness for the setting, so close to where I grew up in eastern Oklahoma, and because of a special interest in the battle dating from visits to the site on family vacations in my youth. Still, I felt the rendering of a family and community transforming themselves in a tough situation was well-told, emotionally engaging, and historically, and its reading left me with a wise perspective on the best in human nature rising above its worst. A nice animated map of the campaign and battle is hosted here."}, {"userName": "Diane Barnes", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7262060-diane-barnes", "userReview": "My GR friend Howard recommended this book over a year ago, and wrote such a great review that I immediately ordered a used copy from Abebooks. Well, you all know how it works. The book arrived, I put it on my shelves with every intention of getting to it soon, then life events and other books pushed it aside. Then, a few days ago I was looking for something I could count on to be fantastic, not just good. My eyes lit on this one and my thinking was: Howard loved it, it's a Civil War novel by an author new to me, I'll give it a go.Long story short, Howard 's reputation is safe, I have a new author to recommend, and I just finished a fantastic book.Ora Hasford has a farm in Arkansas to keep running, with just her 15 year old son, Roman, and her 17 year old daughter, Calpurnia. Her husband has gone to fight for the Southern cause, not because they have slaves or even believe slavery to be moral, but because he doesn't like the Federal government intruding on people's rights. Arkansas is a border state, so sympathizers on both sides are about even. But it's still a surprise to everyone when the small settlement around Elkhorn Tavern erupts with the Battle of Pea Ridge, leaving death and destruction among the citizens. The Hasford family is right in the middle, with the added distraction of a wounded Yankee officer literally left on their doorstep.This novel was meticulously researched, character development is stellar, every detail is perfect as far as plot, and once again, I'm left overwhelmed when I think of what people dealt with at that time, and the strength and courage they needed to survive.\"He had begun to understand some of the things that were happening and the things that could happen. In a war, he thought, it is hard for a body to mind his own business\".There is another book by Douglas C. Jones, \"The Barefoot Brigade\", which chronicles the father's experiences in the army at the same time his family is trying to get by in this one. I've already ordered it, and will not let it get lost on my shelf this time. This was an excellent Civil War novel that focused on what people caught in the cross hairs of the fighting had to deal with.Thanks again, Howard."}, {"userName": "Howard", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32041201-howard", "userReview": "The characters are unforgettable, the atmosphere wonderfully detailed, the action and suspense skillfully maintained. -- Dee Brown, author of Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee Beginning with this book, Jones launched what would become a series of novels recounting the lives of the fictional Hasford-Pay families. The major theme that runs through them is a sense of family loyalty and solidity, especially during times of stress and social change. And what could be more stressful or cause more social change than the Civil War, especially if a major battle were fought in your very neighborhood?It is 1862 and Martin Hasford is away from his home and family serving in the Confederate army in Virginia and Tennessee (His experiences are recounted in Jones' The Barefoot Brigade). Left at home in the Ozark hills of northwestern Arkansas is his wife Ora who must protect their few animals and possessions, but more important, their two teen-aged children, Calpurnia and Roman.Among her many burdens is the necessity of fending off the depredations of roving bands of Jayhawkers and bushwhackers who are roaming freely around the countryside while indiscriminately stealing for their personal gain.If that isn't enough, the battle of Pea Ridge, also known as the battle of Elkhorn Tavern, erupts on and around the Hasford farm. Even though the family sympathizes with the Confederacy, Ora provides shelter for a young Yankee officer, Alan Eben Pay, who has been seriously wounded. Much to the dismay of Roman, it soon becomes evident that his sister is attracted to Allan and that the feeling is mutual.It is also a coming-of-age story for young Roman, who, as the story progresses, takes on more and more of the responsibilities of the man of the house.Douglas Jones brings two gigantic themes in American literature together -- the raw struggle for survival on the American frontier and the grand martial conflict of the American Civil War -- and he successfully weaves them into one seamless story. -- Jack Trammel, Civil War Book Review"}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "Having read and heard so many positive things about this book from fellow GR members whose taste I trust, I decided to look for a used copy of Elkhorn Tavern online and found a copy in time to synchronize with On the Southern Literary Trail's group reading. And I am so glad I did. Those rave reviews were correct. This portrait of a quiet Arkansas valley and the farmers' lives disrupted or lost to marauding nightriders or to battles between Confederate and Union troops, with their infantry, cavalry and artillery, is powerful and has the ring of reality to it. It also reminds me very much of another Civil War historical fiction that I also admired, The Black Flower: A Novel of the Civil War by Howard Bahr, the first of his trilogy, which was written more from the point of view of the soldiers in battle.Elkhorn Tavern presents the Hasford family as \"salt of the earth\" farmers, people who work hard and live by their work. The father, Martin, has gone to war, fighting for the South, which is where most, though not all, of the sympathies in the area lie. His wife Ora is at home with daughter Calpurnia and son Roman. Much of the story is told from their viewpoints as part of the war was fought in the area around their home. How often do we even consider these families who lived in the places where the Civil War battles were fought. There were families there, lives being lived, not all of whom could just up and move away with no real warning and no resources. (It happens in our world today and international charities try to help!) Instead, these people stayed.Douglas Jones combines evocative prose used to describe the changes in nature over the many months that pass during the course of the novel with descriptions of action in battle and terrible carnage that drained me. He is such a skilled writer. He also knows the small tics and signs that reflect human thoughts and feelings, all those unspoken messages that others might see and he can capture on the page. Along with many other readers, I highly recommend reading Elkhorn Tavern."}, {"userName": "Camie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7399266-camie", "userReview": "Portrait of the Hasford family, Ora whose husband has gone to fight for the Confederate army, and her almost grown children Calpurnia and Roman, who struggle to survive on their Arkansas farm in the midst of the Civil War.

While Martin Hasford was away fighting with the Confederate Army, his wife Ora and their teenage son and daughter were left running the farm. The Battle of Pea Ridge was centered around Elkhorn Tavern, close to the Hasford farm. In addition to the danger from the battle, families had to deal with jayhawkers and bushwhackers stealing food and valuables from their farms and burning their homes.Ora was an admirable, tough woman with a kind heart. She took in an injured Union soldier who was fighting gangrene, and felt that the enemy soldier was a good man. All three Hasfords found the inner strength to do what was needed. The book was a coming-of-age story in some ways as fifteen-year-old Roman had to fill his father's shoes.The author wove many historical and military details into the story.

Because war filters through their lives in Arkansas, not far from Missouri. Ora the farmer wife and her two children are the core of the novel. But there is so much more. Pea Ridge and the battle surrounding Elkhorn Tavern during the early years of the War subject this family to a variety of conditions and people who become embedded in their lives. Their food, their stock, their animals are not the only losses. And Martin is in the East on the Confederate side.The long years of the war did not stop the family needs or economic survival. The characters are developed well. And this is the middle book of a trio which follows this family until the post-war years. It seemed realistic and yet at points a tad bit sentimentalized. It was a war that left no home place in disputed or occupied territory to continue upon the usual. And there were always those who played both sides or preyed upon the homesteads and towns with continual criminal intent. All this quite beyond the horrors of battle and its legacy of dying and maimed men. This gives a sharp lens into the border state situations and characters.

Mr. Hasford is out of the picture, having left to join the Confederate Army - despite his opposition to slavery - when the Civil War comes to town. Ora and her children, Calpurnia and Roman, are left to the homestead and to deal with ruffians and soldiers. The narrative of the novel is fast and interesting in its own right but the questions raised are at the base of my enjoyment. What would you do if war came to town? Would you leave your family to join the cause? What cause would justify that? How would you protect your family if faced with lawlessness or, more than that, the laws of warfare? Could you endure?
