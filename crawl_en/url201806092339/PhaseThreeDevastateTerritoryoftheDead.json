I know this series is broken down into novellas, but seriously it's amazing. I'm completely addicted to this story, I'm craving to know what happens next. I'm not even sure I have the right words to explain how phenomenal this third part was. As the story starts out Tabitha an Jayden are still together an going strong. They want to cling to that happiness an are certainly determined to stick together which leads to a HUGE surprise! Everyone seems onboard the Tabitha an Jayden train, but that's really not the case. More survivors are also found, but their revelations just bring about fear an more questions. Tabitha ends up by herself again for awhile! However, this experience is nothing like her time in town, she just might not make it out alive. As for Kellan, well we finally find out what he is, an holy carp is it a curve ball. I definitely recommend this series. It's incredible. Just give it a chance."}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28090823-tara", "userReview": "My major problem with this book was Tabitha, again. Her character contradicts herself so much that it's severely annoying. I can understand her being gullible about Jayden and falling for that load of crap, since she has never had a boyfriend, but the rest there is no excuse. Tabitha and other characters always go on and on about how she is so mature for her age and not like other shallow stupid girls her age and that she is an old soul. However, she is constantly doing the most idiotic things, and remains so gullible and naive when it doesn't make sense for her character anymore. After the zombie invasion her character should have evolved somewhat and not remained the same naive stupid girl. Oh so you find out Jayden is a lying prick that I always knew him for, so why don't you go out and have a hike with zombies, vampires and military personnel that all want to kill you? Sounds like an amazing idea for a naive, moody, stupid little girl having a drama queen moment. But let's remember you aren't like those stupid girls from high school you are a freaking old soul dammit!Aside from her being a moron 90% of the time and excusing Jayden character all together since I have always disliked him, the book was okay. Nothing too exciting. Not even Kellan's moment in the spotlight. Honestly I was thinking really? This is a joke right? Of all the things that is what he is!? It was a bit anticlimactic and definitely not what I would have chosen, but whatever I still love him best. Oh and side note, where did Destiny disappear to? Not even mentioned at all."}, {"userName": "Koalathebear Koalathebear", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5019132-koalathebear-koalathebear", "userReview": "A good ending for this novella trilogy, and there were some interesting insights into the character of Drake. Being Australia, it's hard for me to see the name of Jayden as being anything but boganish, but even so it was a little bizarre to see him cast in such a caddish light. Interesting insights into Kellen although I was a bit underwhelmed by his big reveal... I did enjoy the writing, though and the trilogy was a very enjoyable way to pass a cold, rainy evening."}, {"userName": "Dena", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6071893-dena", "userReview": "a good continuation This is getting better and better. We finally find out what Kellan is Yay... I have been waiting since he rescued them. I'm a little disappointed with how the drama is going on within the survivors. I get Amanda is jealous but seriously people it's the apocalypse not high school.. I like the way it's going and I will definitely keep with it."}, {"userName": "LadiesMan217", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21219279-ladiesman217", "userReview": "[MERMAN????????

There is nothing to anticipate but death, and the body count just keeps growing. I wonder how long it'll be before I become one of them. You know, just another dead body wandering the streets in my never ending search for new prey. In a world like ours, there is no hope. But in the midst of this darkness that we call life, there is Jayden. With his long, dark hair and heated eyes, he's everything that any girl could ever desire. He wants me, and I want him. But there's a problem. I can't stop thinking about the kiss I experienced with Kellan. He might be older. He might be military tough, with an iron will that never bends, but I can't get him out of my mind. Kellan is the sexiest man I've ever seen, but so is Jayden. If you found yourself caught in the middle of two alpha men, how could you choose? Especially knowing that each day could very well be your last... Excerpt: His body had filled out quite a bit in the last several months. Some of it was just normal, that last little push that nature gives every male as he steps into his twenties. But some of it was from all the physical activity we'd both endured. Surviving a zombie apocalypse required quite a bit more stamina than sitting in the classroom. But over time, our bodies had hardened. We'd both grown stronger. We were survivors in a world where so many hadn't been, but surviving had left its mark on both of us. In that moment, though, life was perfect. Sitting there with Jayden, with the sun warming our bodies, I felt carefree again. The world felt bright and new, and nothing could touch us. We were young, and we were in love. Together, we could handle anything that was thrown at us, especially since we had the support of the precious few that were still with us. Couldn't we? If I'd only known what the future held, I might not have jinxed myself by thinking that way. Then again, I might not have changed a thing. The joy that I found in the innocence of our love was so pure and uncomplicated that many times my thoughts have returned to the magic of that day in the grass. It was an exquisite afternoon, a rarity, in a long line of heartaches and heartbreaks. As the years passed, I would learn to treasure the good times. They were few and far between.
