They live with Saul's mother Esme until they can build their own cabin. They eventually move into the new cabin, and have a daughter they name Birdie, and for a time they are happy. It is, however, a time of war, WWI, and Saul, a logging foreman will have to work away from home on a distant mountain. Saul's younger brother Aaron has long pined for Vine, and even though he has a wife and child of his own now, Saul's leaving gives him the golden opportunity of finding Vine alone. The beauty of he Appalachian mountains, so wonderfully and visually described, can picture the setting in my mind, almost smell the wildflowers. Stunning. The love between Saul and Vine, their little family, can be emotionally felt. The longing Vine has for her own family, missing Saul, trying to cope alone, feeling shown, not just told. This is only the second book I have read by this author, the first an arc of one that has not been published yet, but they both have common themes. Characters that feel forced to do something out of their nature, an act in which they will carry a large portion of guilt. Something that will cause hurt to others peripherally involved as well as to themselves. Secrets kept that will slowly fester, spreading out until they find it possible to forgive themselves, and try to set things right.This author is fantastic, his storylines, the way he tells the story, the details he includes, for me raises his fiction to a higher level. The prejudices of the day, Native Americans, thought to be second class citizens, looked down on. Dislike, hate for the things we fear. Some things change, some don't. He includes many things, important issues, love for family, connection to the land, all in a relatively short novel. I have discovered a new writer to cherish, and will be reading more from this author."}, {"userName": "Chrissie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/632247-chrissie", "userReview": "This book is beautiful. The story is about the marriage of a Cherokee woman and a white Southerner, but that is just the beginning. The husband\u2019s brother falls in love with her too. It is about love relationships between man and wife and deep friendship between women, coming to care for another and doing what is right. What if laws do not protect you, what do you do then? The story happens before and up to the conclusion of the First World War. The setting is Appalachia, the Kentucky hinterland.The Southern writing spoke to me. Beautiful, simple and expressive. The spoken words are not grammatically correct, but neither should they be. The characters came alive for me. Each character\u2019s essence is evoked both through actions and words. The women spoke to me, each in their own way. Each became a separate identity. Character portrayal is a strong element of this book!Religious beliefs and traditions are seen through Southerners\u2019 own eyes. Beautifully drawn but without a hint of proselytism.The plot grabbed me and never let go. It got me thinking. What would I do if I were in that predicament? One reflects upon if one should keep silent or if one should speak out the truth. I loved how the story ended. It is beautiful, but it isn\u2019t corny. It is well drawn and care is taken to make it believable. The narration by Kate Forbes is totally fantastic. You simply cannot adjust speeds on your Iphone to achieve perfect tempo; it is only through a talented narrator who knows when to pause and when to rush ahead that the ideal tempo is attained. Forbes masters this. Her southern dialect is never hard to understand and adds to one\u2019s appreciation of the author\u2019s lines. Gorgeous lines and gorgeous narration. Southern culture drawn with finesse. Quite simply a lovely and engaging story. That this book has won numerous prizes doesn\u2019t surprise me in the least:*Winner of the Kentucky Novel of the Year, 2003*Winner of the Award for Special Achievement from the Fellowship of Southern Writers*Nominee of the Southern Book Critics Circle Prize*Nominee of the Book Sense Book of the Year Longlist I will be picking up more books by Silas House very, very soon."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11255849-cheryl", "userReview": "Sometimes you just want a simple story. You read a book and it's so lyrical and bewitching that you can't seem to put it away. And when you do, the story calls to be picked back up. This was one of those books. Simple, sensuous prose and a strong \"voice.\"In the prologue you get to see the mysterious main character, Vine, who is said to be so beautiful that she puts a spell on the men who look at her: \nA thin smile showed itself across her fine, curved face. Her hair was divided by a perfectly straight, pale brown line down the middle of her head. She did not wear plaits, but let her hair swing behind her. It was so long that the ends of it were white from the dust in the sandy yard\u2026The whites of her eyes were as clear as washed eggshells.\nShe is Cherokee Indian. The voice I speak of is that of Vine's: a pure, simple, melodic tune that comes across in ungrammatical verbiage and peculiar syntax. It is alluring because it is not too often that you see such commitment from a writer to his first-person character perspective. This a tragic love story with a fine ending. It is about the harsh realities of family and community. Two brothers of Irish descent, and one Cherokee woman caught between a web of lies and deceit. A mountain town in Kentucky; a Cherokee Indian community isolated within the town, on what is referred to as RedBud Mountain. A town that considers them a threat. A woman and man from both ends of the town fall in love. Imagine the drama there: a woman who must leave her home and settle in with a community that shuns her kind. Inwardly, she struggles to keep a part of her family and heritage with her: \nI spied a little redbud growing in the shade of the woods. It was just beginning to shed its leaves and I knowed it was the wrong time to dig it up, but I had to have it. I went round to Daddy's shed and got a shovel and a swatch of burlap. I dug up the redbud, careful not to break the main root. I was real easy with it, whispering to it the whole time. I pressed damp dirt against the roots, wrapped it in burlap, then soaked it the round ball in the creek. It was surprising how light it was. It was so full of life, but it was no heavier than a finger. I put it out onto the shed, and little rivers of water run down the boards.\"\nIf I fell in love with \"voice\" in this novel, consider me equally in love with \"place.\" House's descriptions of the mountains are beautiful. Maybe it is because I currently live in a mountain town not too far from where he describes. I've driven around the mountains of Kentucky and North Carolina that he writes about, and I too have been fascinated with the Bristol, Tennessee and Bristol, Virginia lines that he describes. Go to a store across the street and they will tell you that you're in Tennessee. Head across the street again for some coffee and you're now in Virginia. Fascinating. When he mentions birdcall and toads mating and creeks running, and crickets and\u2026oh just the melody of the mountainside, he leaves me entranced because I'm reading exactly what I hear daily and those sounds are coming through the pages at me. I've never been to to the mountain hollers where Vine stays and still, I have enough imagery that I can envision them. Sometimes good stories and lessons emerge through beautiful simplicity.\n I walked out to the tree and put my finger to a leaf, smooth like it was coated with wax. I could feel its veins, wet and round. I had always found comfort in the leaves, in their silence. They were like a parchment that holds words of wisdom. Simply holding them in my hand gave me some of the peace a tree possesses.

There is a superstition that she puts curses on the lumbermen that come near her. Saul, a man with an Irish heritage, falls hard for her. Vine leaves her Cherokee community to become his wife and join his family. When World War I begins, Saul leaves their area for a job cutting pine trees which will be used in the production of turpentine. Vine is left behind to care for their young daughter. Vine is upset because Saul's brother Aaron is stalking her and she feels unsafe. But when she tells Saul about her fears, he will not speak to his brother about it. Vine realizes that Saul's \"great fault\" is that he would always choose his family over her. Eventually a confrontation occurs, and Vine keeps a secret from the rest of the family. Forgiveness of others and herself is an important theme in this story.Vine loved the natural world and she senses the presence of God when the wind rustles through the trees. She misses her Cherokee family from Rosebud Camp so she planted a tiny rosebud tree at her new home. Vine \"talked to the tree every day, willing it to live.\" She describes the leaves, \"They were like parchment that holds words of wisdom. Simply holding them in my hand gave me some of the peace a tree possesses. To be like that--to just be--that's the most noble thing of all.\"The story is also about the prejudice that some of the townspeople have against the Native Americans. Silas House's great-grandmother was Cherokee, and she was an inspiration for this book. The author transports us to the Kentucky mountains a century ago with characters talking in the local dialect, fiddle music, poetry, and everyday events on a farm. There are great descriptions of wash day, a snake bite, a pig roast, a country dance, and a Pentecostal service. This book has a winning combination--beautiful writing and an engaging story--and would be a good selection for book clubs."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie", "userReview": "3.5A reader can usually rely on two strong traditions which stem from the American South: solid storytelling and an authentic use of Voice. This Southern writer, Silas House, is capable of both here. For a younger writer, he has an unusually good grasp of Voice in his protagonist, and he weaves a story that you want to jump in and embrace.Setting is lush here, too. A Parchment of Leaves is reminiscent of both A River Runs Through It and Charles Frazier's gorgeous Cold Mountain. For me, there was the added bonus of a Cherokee leading lady as well.I have two complaints, though, and I hope they don't detract from what is good about this book. This story has \"mainstream appeal,\" which I would describe as. . . good for the writer and good for sales, but less good for me, the snobby reader who'd much rather crack open Cold Mountain and read it again than recommend a lesser novel.Also. . . from an editing perspective. . . this was so incredibly and unnecessarily wordy. The woman's hands never shook, they shook like a willow in a breeze on a cold day in winter in the mountains. A man never sat and thought about the consequences, he sat in the silence with the gold-pink of dawn shining in his face while images of what he had done danced around him like wind blowing through a sycamore tree in the autumn.Most writers are guilty of writing too much, not too little. If I had been his editor, I'd have shaved about 100 pages off of this book. Sparse prose can be beautiful, people!! On that note, I'm wrapping up this review, so I don't carry on the naughty tradition of overwriting."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10773168-josh", "userReview": "I\u2019d been trying to get around to this one for some time. The fact that it was voted as one of the April reads within the group \"On the Southern Literary Trail\" was just the nudge I needed. How poignant that the timing just happened to be the same week that the redbud planted off our back patio was in full bloom (granted the 1/3 acre subdivision plot I occupy certainly isn't within the spirit of the turn of the century Eastern Kentucky in which House describes the redbuds, flowers, creeks, meadows, hog killings, and house raisings). It was a step back in time, but the primary themes are no doubt relevant to our modern world just the same. For some, the author\u2019s gentle approach might not hit the endorphin receptors with enough vigor, but for me, I think he did a masterful job of writing in so many elements so subtlety. You really don\u2019t become aware of how impactful the entire thing is until you have just about finished it all up. Much like Clay's Quilt the story is largely a character story; personally, this one was more captivating. The basic story line is that a Cherokee beauty who had been raised to almost flee from her heritage does just that by marrying a young local boy who had originally been sent to clear the timber from the mountainsides towering above her family's home place. In leaving with her man, she says goodbye to this world, and the struggles of a \"normal life\" ensue. Much more than that would be spoiler.At the heart, it is a story about family, humanity, meanness, kindness, secrets, love, infatuation, personalities, and prejudices. Do bad things happen for reason of curse, chance, or perhaps to provide contrast to the great and good things of life? Forgiveness is powerful, sometimes undeserved but necessary in most cases. People are going to keep being mean to one another, and the trick is to decide whether to let other's poison seep into your pores or allow it to only sicken those who emit it. Vine, the main character sums it up when she states:\"It will come back on you, what you've done,\" I said. \"A person can only do so much wrong before it catches up with him. Someday it will find you out!\"4.5 stars that gets rounded to a 5 because of House's interest in great music (he also blogs on modern folk, indie rock, and Americana music) and by virtue of a great looking book cover."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2665172-carol", "userReview": "I have nothing negative to say about this book. It was truly excellent. I always feel weird about giving five stars, feeling obligated to give *some* kind of constructive criticism. Here? Nothing. I can't find one thing. Believe me, I tried. (I don't give five stars very easily.)So I guess I'll talk about all the things I liked:When it comes to Voice, Silas House is up there with Mark Twain. I could literally hear these characters talking. I now plan to read everything else he has written, based on this one book alone and his amazing talent with capturing character voice.The descriptions were heart-wrenching and beautiful. I loved how House used elements of nature and the scenery to tell the story. The story itself moved so slowly, so effortlessly; it was a little like the seasons changing. You see it happening in front of your eyes but don't realize that it happened until you look back on it. That's the way I feel about this book. It snuck up on me. If you told someone what the book is about, the plot itself, they'd probably shrug and say, \"Doesn't sound all that interesting.\" But somehow, the way House writes it, it's riveting, like you've never read anything even remotely like it in your entire life. So my advice is don't even bother reading the synopsis. By the end, you won't be reading it because of the plot anyway. You just inexplicably won't be able to put it down.Favorite quote: \"I walked out to the tree and put my finger to a leaf, smooth like it was coated with wax. I could feel its veins, wet and round.

Astonishingly good. This is a book I could read again and there aren't many of those. The novel is set in 1917 Crow County, Kentucky. House grew up in Laurel County, Kentucky and says he based the fictional Crow County on the neighboring county of Leslie, where he spent much of his childhood. 'A Parchment of Leaves' is about home, belonging, love, family, betrayal, all loose and wondering around everywhere in the pages of this novel. The protagonist is Vine, a full blood Cherokee girl, who it is said was so beautiful that she bewitched all the men who saw her. \"The truth was this: her beauty had so transfixed their thoughts that they could not keep their minds on the work at hand. They could think of nothing but her eyes - round and black as berries - and her brown arms, propped up on the slats of the paling fence. They saw her strong jawbone curving toward her chin, her blue-black hair flapping behind her like clothes hung out to dry. They were mesmerized by the image they had caught of her, and they carried it up the mountain in such a way that they neglected to watch where they were walking or the angle of their axes or the intensity of the fires they built.\" Then one day, the beautiful Vine meets Saul Sullivan, an Irish logger. Their meeting is dramatic and unforgettable. The details of Vine's and Saul's family are rich. The reader feels as though they know each member of the family, especially Sauls' brother Aaron, and his mother, Esme, who take on roles as important secondary characters. House carries us into the rush of the US towards its materialistic future. We see the townies looks down on the folks from the hollers and see the prejudices as they were then, basic, and raw, unfiltered. Vine is dazzling, and Saul is earthy. Esme is the mother hen that embraces them both, and later, we learn of Esme's secret. Aaron is a boy who grows up to become the wrong kind of man. The reader learns that the meaning of family is always shifting and that sometimes the foundation is pulled out from under that meaning so that it may topple altogether. What a delicate and fine textured story House weaves. Vine moves a redbud tree from her old home place to her new home. She coaxes it to live because she has moved it at the wrong time of year. Vine talks to the tree and pets it. Here's a quote from the novel regarding the redbud tree. \"Then I noticed the new leaves on the redbud tree. The puple buds were being pushed away to make way for the leaves. I walked out to the tree and put my finger to a leaf, smooth like it was coated with wax. I could feel its veins, wet and round. I had always found comfort in the leaves, in their silence. They were like a parchment that hold words of wisdom. Simply holding them in my hand gave me some of the peace a tree possesses. To be like that - to just be - that's the most noble thing of all.\" Vine takes a lot from nature, from her setting, and as we see in this quote, she soaks it up like a sponge. However, it doesn't seem a coincidence that the redbud tree is also known as the Judas tree. Vine never seems separate from nature, but always part of it, and as her story plays out, the backdrop is the constant of the creek, the birds, the things growing in her garden, and her home that springs up from the trees that create it. House has created a lush setting and teemed it with characters that I grew to love."}, {"userName": "Ctgt", "userReviewDate": "Apr 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3787451-ctgt", "userReview": "I walked out to the tree and put my fingers to a leaf, smooth like it was coated with wax.

Vine, a Cherokee girl, is thought by some to be a witch. Men who have gone to the mountain to clear lumber often meet with peculiar accidents after seeing Vine. Saul and his younger brother Aaron decide to venture to the mountain in hopes of earning money only to see Vine and fall under her spell.

I've heard people say that they liked to watch the world come awake. But the world is always awake, sunlight just makes it seeable.In that moment when the light hits the mountain, when the sun cracked through the sky big enough to make a noise if our ears could hear it, I would be aware again of all the things that had been going on throughout the night. Morning just made it easier to hear. Light takes away muteness.I wondered if trees were God. They were like God in many respects: they stood silent, and most people only noticed them when the need arose. Maybe all the secrets to life were written on the surface of leaves, waiting to be translated. If I touched them long enough, I might be given some information that no one else has.and life in general,I had laid awake some nights wondering why other women had men who laid drunk all the time, who took their fists to them. Some women had men who wouldn't work or had another woman in town or whipped their children a little too hard. But here was my husband's great wrongness and I should have seen it sooner. He would always choose his family over me.A wonderful story of love and redemption.I wondered if we were out on the earth only to destroy every beautiful thing, to make chaos.

At the heart of this book is exposure to the way racism has always been fueled by land ownership rights and the way that laws always restricted rights of persons of color while quite obviously favoring White European ancestry. This book exposed me to \"Melungeons\", a census classification of a tight-knit group of people with dark skin, and black hair, that had Turkish/Moorish as well as African, American Indian, and White European heritage.

I wish I had read it instead of listened to it though because I wanted copy so many of the lines. I will probably ask for a copy as a gift so I can underline and mark in it. The writing is beautiful and speaks to my southern soul. Also, it felt like he was in a way writing my families story. I've always wondered how in one generation the intermarriage of a Native American to a white person could loose all connection to their heritage. This book answered this question for me clearly. It happened on both sides of my family- leaving me disconnected from my Creek heritage through my dad and my Cherokee heritage thru my mom in one swift marriage during the time of \"The Removal\" in Alabama. So many indians hid out and still faced persecution and eviction from their lands decades later for other reasons. Often the NA's would purposely shun their heritage in order to \"fit in\" and so \"it would be easier\" for their children just as Vine's dad did for his daughter. There is so much more to this story than the theme of Native American detachment to their culture and ways. But I don't want to spoil it for anyone who hasn't read this wonderful book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is Southern, descended from Native peoples, or loves all things southern. I will hold so many of the words of this book close to my heart.

Silas House has written a tale of a young Cherokee woman, Vine, who marries a young white man in the years just before World War I. The couple live in a small valley ( a \"holler\") tucked up high in the Appalachian Mountains of eastern Kentucky. This novel is made up of a lyrical blend of Appalachian folklore, music, and natural science and ecology, and the story of a tragedy that begins to unfold early on in the book. One senses early on that this cannot end well, and it doesn't in some respects, but it ends right. It was a difficult life that these people had to live in the early-20th century in this part of America, but at the same time Silas House's words brings the natural beauty of this part of Appalachia leaping off of each and every page. You can almost feel and hear the mountain breezes moving through the tall trees, feel the cold water of the creek as Vine washes her freshly-picked blackberries, and see the delicate blossoms of the lady-slippers nestled up against lichen-covered rocks. Folktales, superstitions, dancing, gardening, cabin-building, homeopathic medicine, and even cooking recipes are all seamlessly woven into this beautiful tale.While there are moments of darkness, pain and anguish that are reminiscent of Cormac McCarthy or Thomas Hardy, they are balanced by the deep abiding love that Vine has for her husband, Saul, their little daughter, Birdie, and her family and her few loyal friends, especially the irascible and 'tough-as-nails' midwife, Serena; but it is Vine's faith in goodness of the \"great spirit\" around her in the environment that helps her persevere through tragedy. It is her Cherokee heritage and connection to the land that makes this story work so well. Like the little redbud tree that she brings down from her Cherokee mountaintop home and plants next to the house she now shares with her husband, and over time the little tree grows up and puts down its roots, and so does Vine grow stronger in her ability to shelter, love, and protect her family.Simply put, I loved this novel, and know that I will be reading it again many times over the coming years."}, {"userName": "Marg", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3084107-marg", "userReview": "One of the big advantages of being part of a book club is that you often find yourselves being encouraged to read books that you just normally wouldn't read. This is especially true if that particular book club has quite eclectic tastes. This year alone we have read Fifty Shades of Grey the book that shall not be named, To Kill a Mockingbird, and then this book among others.A Parchment of Leaves is a book that I hadn't heard of before, or even the author! It is historical fiction, but it is firmly set in a particular time and place - the mountains of Kentucky during the early 1900s - one which I haven't read much about at all. Whilst the events in the larger world do have an impact on the lives of the people, they are also relatively self contained within their area. One reason why I found this era so interesting to read about it is that it seems kind of in between, especially in terms of technology. For example, whilst there were some cars and trucks, for most people this was beyond reach and so they still either walked or rode their horses and most chores around the house were still very labour intensive.The book opens with young Saul Sullivan braving the rumours about a Cherokee girl who is so beautiful that men die when they see her and heads to her home, looking for work. He has his younger brother Aaron with him. Whilst he doesn't die as soon as he see Vine, he is slayed emotionally and he knows that she just has to be his wife. This is reiterated when his younger brother is bitten by a snake and Vine and her family save Aaron's life.

His nuance on the wider community culture and interchange is superlative, as well. Vine tells her story. It's simply told, although it is not in any way, IMHO, a simple story. Yet the way the story is told, it always holds her (Vine's) heart and her mind at its core. I love this old-fashioned way of relating family experience too. You don't get to read Saul's or Aaron's inner core- you see them 90% through the eyes of their wife or their Mother. Not that it would have been \"bad\" to give the men more of a voice, but the way this is written is far more realistic. The men are \"guessing\" even on each other's motives or wants and they are almost nearly unexpressed in the verbal to their women folk.

I've never read a book like this before and it is quite different from the fiction I typically read. The author's writing is beautiful and poetic and he really breathes life into the characters and scenery of the novel. This book for me was ultimately about forgiveness and I loved Vine's journey and how she learned to forgive others, but more importantly how she discovered how to forgive herself. I was also impressed with how diverse the cast of characters were. I would highly recommend this book!"}, {"userName": "Lawyer", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3025547-lawyer", "userReview": "Review to follow.

Sounds like \"and then the murders began\" would appropriately follow, right? Unfortunately, Vine isn't a witchy woman; she's just super hot to the point that idiot men can't quit staring at her to do their jobs and they suffer misfortune. Still, I was interested, but the story was super simplistic for my taste.Basically, Vine meets her husband when his brother is bitten by a snake and she heals him. The brother harbors a creepy obsession with her resulting in rape, and Vine kills him and covers it up. Scattered through the text is a significant amount of cultural norms from this time period including the racism towards Native Americans, the allure of opportunity in other geographical regions, and women's rights. Serena, the midwife who smacks her husband in the face with a pan when she finds out he has cheated and divorces him, is obviously my favorite character. I liked Vine mostly (despite her awful grammar), and Esme and Aidia were fine, but Serena was a badass who knew how to take a secret to her grave, even if it wasn't hers to carry.Something that I appreciated about this text were how strong the women were, even when physically frail. They're darker-skinned, hardworking, hearty, and resourceful. Esme's grandfather clock was a symbol that stuck out to me, as the women were the keepers of time while the men were struggling in a time where they were asked to put their \"real lives\" on hold for the war, a job that will pay well, etc. I also found the struggle that the younger women were up against interesting. Though Saul cares deeply for Vine (the only halfway decent guy in the book. I mean, even Vine's father tried to beat her mother...), he won't do anything when she tells him Aaron makes her uncomfortable. Saul acts as if she's egged it on, much like a modern-day female dynamic where women often can't talk to a guy without being accused of leading him on. At least Aaron was depicted as mentally unstable and not an average man.I also found the treatment of race interesting in this book; it was odd because it wasn't very \"in your face.\" People called people of other ethnicities names and made them feel unwelcomed, but that was about it. The reader could see the tension, but there was no explosion. Being from Tennessee, I enjoyed there being a Melungeon character, thought there wasn't much about Aidia except that she grew up poor and relied on men to care for her. I liked what was there from Vine's Cherokee heritage, but was disappointed that her family didn't really discuss it because her father desired to assimilate. Overall, I felt like this book had some holes that couldn't be filled due to House's simplistic narrative.I also read some reviews that stated House wrote from a female perspective well, but I can't say I agree. Though he explored figurative language, Vine's emotions were never conveyed enough for me, especially after she killed her brother-in-law.The language in this book was super flowery in a way I didn't appreciate, but I thought I got clear images of the scenery.I enjoyed that House included different ways of being spiritual in the text, like the Cherokees thinking God is outside, not in a church, and how people tried to reform the outliers in the community. I do, however, wish Vine hadn't been tempted by the preacher she didn't know offering her forgiveness, though. If anything, shouldn't she have tried to purify herself in nature?My biggest disappointment was the ending; I thought it was leading up to something big: \"But here was my husband's great wrongness, and I should have seen it sooner. He would always choose his family over me\" (76). Towards the end, it states that Saul doesn't want to \"[let Vine get away over the mountains like this]\" and I completely thought he was going to kill her. In fact, reading about her seeing God in the leaves at the end made me sure he had killed her, until I found nothing online about it and I realized that he simply hugged her as a sign of forgiveness. Oh. Anyway, it was worlds better than Cold Mountain!"}, {"userName": "Glenna Pritchett", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9932367-glenna-pritchett", "userReview": "This book spoke to me.It spoke to me of love, in all its forms as named by the Greeks: storge, philia, agape, and eros. Of mothers who will do anything for their children, and for other women's children too. Of women who form unbreakable bonds even closer than those of sisters. Of community and the spirit of helping one another. And of the connection between a man and a woman that truly makes them one.It spoke to me in the dialect of my family, the Appalachian way of speaking full of remnants of the Scottish and English people who settled the isolated mountains and valleys. It's almost gone now, erased by education and exposure to radio and television. At times I read out loud because I knew exactly how the dialogue should sound. And I laughed when I read colorful phrases like \"flat as a flitter\" and \"higher than a cat's back\" that I still hear from my octogenarian mother. Then I got a bit teary-eyed because her generation is the last to whom that way of speaking comes naturally. The book comforted me. Life is hard, always has been and always will be, but we get through it with the help of all the connections we make with other people. I loved the cover, the title (which puzzled me at first but then I found the inspiration for it near the end of the book), and Silas House's writing style. I just loved the whole book, period. It has taken a place on the small shelf of books that I will read again and again, because they filled a place in my heart."}, {"userName": "Wendy Ballard", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57011605-wendy-ballard", "userReview": "A Parchment of Leaves is a lyrical, thought-provoking novel. House's description of people and landscapes is breath-taking. Not every person is beautiful in the classical sense and not every landscape is forgiving. But every person and landscape are unforgettable. Set in the 1900s in rural Kentucky, A Parchment of Leaves is the story of Saul's marriage to Vine, a Cherokee woman. Saul and Vine's marriage begins quietly. They live in Saul's mother's home until they build their own home a short distance from his mother's (Esme) home. All is well for a time until Saul must spend months away from Vine to work in another county. He assumes she will be safe with Esme and Saul's brother, Aaron. Aaron develops an obsession with Vine that threatens to tear about the family.The story is told from Vine's POV and you will be immediately drawn in. Her personality is at times childlike and at other times, wise beyond her years. She stoically cares for their child and their home until Saul can finally come home. Her strength in managing Aaron's obsession is one of the most compelling parts of the novel. The strength of the female characters that tends to mark Silas House's writing is in the foreground here. The men's willingness to appreciate this strength marks the novel as extraordinary. In addition to the character definition and superb storyline, House always blends music and literature into his plots and characters' lives - absolutely beautiful."}, {"userName": "Eileen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28117212-eileen", "userReview": "Skilled storytelling in the voice of a strong and keen-sensing Cherokee woman, Vine, as she lives a simple life in the richly earthy surrounding of rural Kentucky in the early 1900's. There she marries Saul, starts a family, and finds herself facing relationship strife with her brother-in-law, Aaron. Vine is a very well-drawn character with whom it is easy to immediately identify even when coming from a significantly different perspective. Her personal and authentic point-of-view is admirably well done and makes this book a standout piece of historical fiction. The nature of her relationship with Aaron was somewhat different than I expected but I think its actual form still contributed to building some tension. I did think the end of the book could have been better executed. It felt a little rushed and less well developed. I had a couple of earlier predictions on how the book may end and think there were some options to make the ending more powerful. I did enjoy discovering this author and look forward to reading another book of his."}, {"userName": "Katie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350937-katie", "userReview": "A beautifully told story, \"A Parchment of Leaves\" takes the reader to the early 1900's in the Appalachian mountains.

Many town members discriminate against her, but those in her close circle, including her mother-in-law, Esme, accept her unconditionally. Particularly disconcerting and ominous is the fixation that Saul's younger brother, Aaron has on her. He selects a wife with an uncanny resemblance to Vine, and in one horrible night, his obsession results in tragedy that changes Vine's life forever.
