Max left Philly man years ago and gave up being a cop. He lives in the shacks of the Everglades and would pretty much prefer not to associate with others. He is a very private man. His high school buddy is a succesful lawyer who has Max freelance as a private investigator. His old girlfriend is on the police department and feels missing girls are not missing but dead. She thinks an ex cop from Philly is responbile and convinces Max to find evidence to arrest him. The plot moves at a quick pace and both stories are told well. Max is investigating a cruise ship company who is threatening their illegal workers after a boiler blows up. You feel for these people who are trying to make a living and are exploited by the rich people. He also is helping out with the missing girls. King keeps his storyline tight and when clues are presented, he doesnt give you a false lead or red herrings but you need to figure it out and decide how to use the infomation to determine what happened to these girls."}, {"userName": "Wyckliffe Howland", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/35558830-wyckliffe-howland", "userReview": "Max Freeman, retired Philly cop in the Fla Everglades - this time investigating an 80 year old crime.

In the first plaguey chapter we are shown in detail the moonlit flight of Cyrus Mayes and his two sons from the Everglades road site (the Tamiani Trail) to what would be their grave site. The private road company proved to be as nefarious as the gators, mosquitoes, and quicksand of Freeman\u2019s beloved Glades.King swiftly fasts forward to the present. Armed with letters from Cyrus, Mark Mayes hires Billy Manchester to find out what happened to his great-grandfather and uncles. Intrigued by the 80 year old missing persons' case, Max agrees to look into the mystery. But the Modern Day Company has reasons to stop Freeman and Manchester: millions of dollars in liability. To solve this case Max he needs the old Glades man, Nate Brown and a lot of luck.Meanwhile, Detective Sherry Richards has a problem of her own \u2013 a female colleague is being abused by her boyfriend: another cop. As Max gets closer to the evil that threatens both him and Manchester, his lady friend becomes obsessed with her friend\u2019s plight.Yes, Freeman still describes himself when he looks into a mirror, lives in that isolated shack with the mismatched armoires; the top bunk is still his eclectic library (novels, history, and travel books), his coffee is still brewed on the propane burner. But Max is more comfortable in his own skin than in the prior two books. He finally tells Sherry about his abusive father and fears what affect that information on her given her need to protect her friend at all costs. The conflicts are delicious and King never slows the pace until the very last word."}, {"userName": "Colin David", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2526360-colin-david", "userReview": "This is the third book in the series, of a Philly Cop, Max Freeman, disabled out of the force, living in the Florida Everglades.

The client has discovered old letters from his ancestor detailing all sorts of injustices and horrors faced by those building the Tamiami Trail through the Everglades, horrors that may have lead to a violent end. From the opening chapter, King brings the Everglades vividly to life on the page \u2013 the atmosphere, setting, and history of an area filled with murky water and murkier deeds. As we follow Freeman on his chase for the truth, themes of corporate greed, family ties, sense of self, and more are all woven into a well-written and gripping tale.

Billy has been asked by a young man, Mark Mayes, to find out what happened to his great-grandfather and two uncles who disappeared while working for a private company building the first highway across the Everglades in 1923. Freeman quickly realizes uncovering the past is not only difficult, but dangerous.*** It\u2019s the characters, dialogue and sense of place that draws me in and keep me there page after page. Max and Billy are great characters with a strong, involving history. The secondary characters are interesting, rich and dimensional. The contrast between the city and the Everglades, as well as the time Freeman\u2019s spends on the water between the two, adds an atmosphere and richness to the story. The plot is a bit weak\u2014I never did quite understand the motive for the killings in the 20\u2019s, but the sense of melancholy and nature versus nurture was compelling.

Similar in style and quality to Michael Connelly and John Sandford. This was the first title of King's that I \"read\" (I listened to the audiobook version read by David Colacci). It is one of his Max Freeman series, though not the first. The story moves between the present time investigation conducted by Freeman and decades earlier deaths that occur in the course of the early 1900s construction of Florida's Tamiami Trail into the Everglades. The central protagonist, Max Freeman, a former Philly policeman, is hired by a young man wanting to learn the circumstances of the mysterious deaths of his grandfather who worked the construction of the Trail. Freeman begins to unravel complex details about the construction project that even present day corporate entities are determined to keep hidden. Characters are well drawn, plot twists abound, and resolution -- at last -- is satisfying and not too far-fetched!

I like Max, now a PI, and his dedication to his clients.Why only 3 stars? The whole thing was just a bit too unrealistic. The characters were supermen/superwomen who were always just one inch from disaster. They never slept, but charged full speed ahead for days at a time. Travel must have been by magic as our hero would go from the depths of the Everglades in a boat to Ft. Lauderdale or Miami in the blink of an eye. Then would continue on elsewhere, meet with people, avoid disaster and return to the middle of the Everglades before dark!!"}, {"userName": "David Bonesteel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2659688-david-bonesteel", "userReview": "Max Freeman, an ex-cop turned PI who is haunted by the violence in his past, investigates an 80-year-old murder case. The result is a pretty formless thriller without any thrills. Author Jonathan King seems to recognize the plodding nature of Max's investigation, because he makes a number of digressions to scenes of violence from his hero's years on the Philadelphia police force and an unrelated sub-plot concerning a policeman who beats his girlfriend. The conclusion of the mystery is unsatisfying and there is scarcely a single scene of true suspense. The prose is direct but unremarkable.

Max is a man who loves beverages and getting to the truth no matter what danger is involved. His friend Billy is perhaps the perfect man. He is so attractive that women accost him in the street. His IQ is off the scale, he dresses beautifully, lives in a great apartment overlooking the sea, is a wonderful cook and what's more he can commit. And to top it off he's a very nice person who'll always go that extra mile to help a friend. The plot is good and fast paced. The descriptions of the Everglades are a highlight for me, a person who lives in a very dry part of Australia. All that water sounds so exotic.

OK, this is still a good book, however it seemed a little lighter than the first two in the series. I have found this with other series as well. Sometimes the writer just fires one off to add another lot to the series and might miss his, or hers, mark a bit. Overall not a bad book at all.
