This book is not for the wannabe or the wuss, but for those who desire to strengthen their ability to serve. Serving is not necessarily an aspiration many seem to share, nor it is a lovey bed of roses--there are thorns and Swindoll even takes a look at the dark side of service. But overall this book, to which there are parts where you may say amen or ouch, takes a close look at what service and what it isn't in light of serving God first and foremost."}, {"userName": "Loveleah", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3463390-loveleah", "userReview": "How to offer yourself selflessly to other people. =)"}, {"userName": "Taylor Guffey", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20892242-taylor-guffey", "userReview": "This was a difficult book to read because it made me realize that I need to change.

Swindolls shows in Improving your Serve what servant leadership is all about and that it\u2019s much more than willingness to do the nasty jobs no one else wants to. Being a true servant is about giving, forgiving, forgetting. It\u2019s about a state of mind, a way of thinking, a change of the heart to truly become like Jesus.And Swindoll makes this point by using Scripture to tell us what God has in mind for us, how He wants us to serve. His key verse is Mark 10:45: \"For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve, and to give His life as a ransom for many.\"For me, the biggest eye-opener was to discover through this book that much of my serving was still aimed at me. I did it to be a good leader, to show that I wasn\u2019t above doing the dishes, or mopping the floor. But in my heart, I did it to prove something, I didn\u2019t do it for God. I served, but I still wanted people to see it in some way and appreciate me for it.For a full review, see: http://www.youthleadersacademy.com/im..."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12797740-david", "userReview": "The Book Improving Your Serve, by Charles R. Swindoll has helped me change my view so much on the world. It has taught me to stop thinking about the Me, Myself and I tactic and focus on serving others. The fact that the author was able to tap into my life so much amazed me. I felt as though Swindoll was speaking right to me. Like he understood everything I saw on a daily basis, as if he had known me forever. I know that because of reading this book I will definitely start changing my outlook and putting others before me. I give this book a 5 out of 5 stars because of the ability to really connect with the reader and ability to draw us to make a change. Overall fantastic book, I would recommend it to everyone!"}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2933782-andrea", "userReview": "I hate to review books I haven't finished (I hate to not finish books in general), but after about 30 pages I couldn't really justify the time it would take to get through the whole book. This book just misses. It's premise is good (being like Christ in serving others), but it's arguments and foundations are lacking. Swindoll talks of happiness, success and satisfaction and I get the impression that he communicates the principles in his book to help people live more fulfilled lives. It reads like an \"unlocking the potential in your life\" kind of book. Like following Christ is just another way (or even the preferred way) to making your life count and being happy while doing it. He seems to anticipate his readers' reluctance to giving it all and writes in a chapter that I skimmed at the end of the book, \"If we are truly faithful to God in every area of life, some of us may very well be called to follow Him to the ends of the earth. Many have done that. He may even ask a few of us to serve in some bold and difficult act of personal sacrifice here at home or abroad. But it's not always that way. In fact, I would say it is not even very often that way. Most of the time the Lord makes somewhat smaller demands on us...but they still require unselfishness.\" How sad that after 200 pages of trying convince people that it's good to serve you need to reassure them that God probably isn't going to actually ask you to do anything too hard or crazy. Don't worry. You can most likely still go about your comfortable lives and just focus on the little things that count for God. I find no biblical support for the idea that \"most of the time the Lord makes somewhat smaller demands of us.\" The author himself quotes Luke 9:23 earlier in the book and argues that following Christ is \"terribly expensive\" and costly. His inconsistent application of the Bible and his own thoughts is evident throughout what I read and skimmed. In his chapter called \"A Case for Unselfishness\" the author writes, \"These verses [1 Peter 5:5-7] address three crucial realms related to true success: authority, attitude, and anxiety. And the best part of all of this: Following God's directives will bring the one benefit not found in the world's empty promises: a deep sense of lasting satisfaction. It's what we could call the forgotten side of success. And I would add that it is the success that will come to those who wish to develop the heart of a servant.\" To get to this kind of success, you must humble yourself to those who are wise, humble yourself \"under God's mighty hand,\" and throw yourself on the mercy and care of God. When we do those things, \"Instead of all those hours pushing and promoting, we'll wind up with more time for friends and family. And the Lord will even grant you some time for yourself, plus a few extra hours to go fishing!\" He continues with a caution that we shouldn't confuse selfishness and good self-esteem. \"Without a strong belief in ourselves, we are easily crippled and wounded in life...as a matter of fact, without a healthy ego, without the confidence that God is in us, on our side, pulling for us, we become fragile, easily bruised, counterproductive people.\" So even in the chapter about not being selfish, the motivation is still about the self (wanting to be fulfilled and even have time for hobbies), and the means is a belief that God is pulling for us. Swindoll just misses the point that true Christ-like servanthood is not the means to a better life in terms of success or fulfillment, but a life for God's glory (and it may not leave us any time for fishing)! Not only does the message still seem to be about how this perspective will change our experience in life (instead of how it will glorify God), but the author seems to be mistaken about in whose power this is achieved. He writes, \"There is a better way. Jesus says, 'Be a servant, give to others!' Now that's a philosophy that anyone can understand. And, without question, it is attainable.\" Later on he writes that, \"Deep down inside most Christians I know there is a deep-seated desire to release instead of keep...to give instead of grab. It's worth whatever it takes to let that start happening.\" What I have read so far gives me the impression that you just have to want to follow Jesus, change your attitudes and follow your Christian impulses and then you will be able to be a good servant and have a better life. It's still all about self. I believe Swindoll had good intentions. He quotes a lot of verses (which is more than I can say for a lot of \"Christian\" books out there) and he devotes entire sections of the chapters to the biblical basis for his perspective, but his application of them just doesn't go deep enough and he doesn't start from the most important principle: we exist for God's glory and and we rely on God to live for it. You just can't get to the right conclusions if you think we can be good Christians in our own power and for the purpose of living more fulfilled lives.His writing reminds me of James Dobson - cultural Christianity with no real unified theology behind it. I have only read one of Dobson's books (The Strong-Willed Child) but I couldn't believe how awful it was - totally lacking in biblical principles (encouraging the exact opposite in many cases). To be fair to Swindoll (unlike Dobson), I believe he was actually trying to be biblical and I believe he really did study the Bible to come to his conclusions (he even hits on some good and accurate principles sometimes), but he still seems to be viewing Christianity through his lens of American \"morality\" culture instead of the a radical, all for God's glory, need God every day, fight against our flesh and his understanding of the Bible seems to lack depth and cohesion. He lacks a unified theology that ties all the verses he quotes together, not as truisms, but as a way to know God and worship him with our lives. Even in giving the author the benefit of the doubt, I couldn't recommend this book because it leaves you with the dangerous understanding that you can have it all: your comfortable American lifestyle and your service for God and others. I would be concerned that it encourages people to be lukewarm (Rev. 3:16) and leaves them with a false confidence in themselves and their service."}, {"userName": "Madelle", "userReviewDate": "Oct 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1191851-madelle", "userReview": "Becaue we are going to Kenya in November to work in mission hospital where our son and daughter in law are serving, Samaritan's Purse sent us this book by prolific writer, Charles Swindoll, to read.

I first read this in a small group study while I was in university. Written in the 1980's but still culturally relevant as we live in a society dominated by self-interest. Good reminders of how Christians are called to be different--live servant lives. Opening chapters are on forgiving and forgetting, which Swindoll considers integral aspects of being servants and then he moves to the Beatitudes from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5-7) as key servant characteristics. The book concludes with a reminder of the call to follow Jesus' example, knowing that being a faithful servant will not be easy or applauded by all who surround us. Most of his chapters are well-grounded in scripture."}, {"userName": "Eric", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27678334-eric", "userReview": "A young friend recommended this one to me, which was somewhat surprising as it was likely written several years before he was born. I told him early on that my antennae went up with the seeming tennis metaphor in the title (it's really not about sport, thankfully). Swindoll has here an excellent message, but I sense that its genesis springs from motivation rooted in the paradigm of greed that he speaks of as being central to the times. Several times I had a thought that this could have been written using half the words, and let me go on to actually be of service. This appears to be the only thing of Swindoll's that I've read, and perhaps I should give another work a chance when I'm not set to pre-judge it based on the title."}, {"userName": "Shawna Yancy", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6179909-shawna-yancy", "userReview": "This book presents a different way of living.
