Putting Jesse in the crosshairs of a past enemy and Shadow missing.Finding herself way out of her league and with the ones she holds most dear at risk, Scarlett has to pull out all the stops.Amazing, action intense, unexpected and with out a doubt a new favorite, Shadow Hunt is one of those reads you just didn\u2019t want to put down.I started this series at book 3, Shadow Hunt as an ARC review requested by the publisher. After finishing Shadow Hunt I instantly went back and purchased book 1, Midnight Curse, and book 2, Blood Gamble because I knew Olson's writing is something that would be added to must read shelf.

The quality and encompassing world that Melissa Olson has built wraps around the reader entirely enveloping a journey of ups, downs, and excitement. These novels are fast paced and keep you up into the night glued to the pages. There\u2019s no explicit sex but plenty of romance woven into the books to even out Scarlett\u2019s life. For those of you who want to jump in feet first from the beginning of this series as a whole, it would be beneficial to start with the Scarlett Bernard novels before joining this second series arc."}, {"userName": "Jeanny", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16737045-jeanny", "userReview": "Pet peeve: baby"}, {"userName": "Shelley", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3081722-shelley", "userReview": "*Source* NetGalley*Genre* Urban Fantasy*Rating* 4.0*Thoughts*Shadow Hunt is the third installment in author Melissa F. Olson's Disrupted Magic trilogy. If you've read Blood Gamble, the second installment in this new trilogy, you know that our protagonist, Scarlett Bernard, got stunning news at the end of that story that has put her in a very difficult and dangerous position. Especially if anyone with a grudge against her finds out. But, what's even more disconcerting, is that a former enemy has returned with a major vendetta against the city, Scarlett, Shadow, and the Old World which consists of Vampires, Witches, and Werewolves.*Full Review @ Gizmos Reviews*http://gizmosreviews.blogspot.com/201..."}, {"userName": "Jeanine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 25, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/708172-jeanine", "userReview": "I loved this newest edition of Scarlett's story.

Olsen was out I knew I had to catch up on the series. I enjoyed reading the start of this series a few years ago but couldn't really remember what had happened, so i reread them, then jumped straight into the spin off series Boundary Magic. Having the whole series fresh in my head really helped me in following the story for Shadow Hunt, especially with the mentions of characters from Boundary Magic.Shadow Hunt begins with possibly the biggest surprise, it as definitly one I didn't see coming, which results in a drive for Scarlett to Colorado to see Lex, and ask a lot of questions. But whilst she is there Shadow is taken, and Scarlett will stop at nothing to find her.I have found myself getting more invested in this series as it goes on, I love Scarlett as a character, she isn't afraid to dive into things without knowing the outcome (although she is a little more reserved in Shadow Hunt) and she isn't afraid to seek out the answers to her questions. I like that Scarlett still has her friends around her who will support and help her as much as possible, even going as far as to look after Shadow and fight to protect her.There were moments in Shadow Hunt that I feared for the worst, for Shadow, for Jesse, and even for Scarlett. There were twists and turns I didn't see coming within the pages of this book, and I liked the different routes that were taken to answer these problems as they arose. The end of Shadow Hunt definitly leaves you wanting more, and I am really interested in seeing where this series can go from here.\nFinal Verdict\nShadow Hunt has to be my most surprising book out of the series so far. Things that arise I really did not see coming and I am super interested in finding out where this leaves Scarlett now."}, {"userName": "Suz", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2281137-suz", "userReview": "Well, that was a couple of unexpected turns of events.

This latest installment to Scarlet Bernard's story is definitely one of the best. It wraps so many things up brilliantly while still leaving you aching for more. The tie-in to the Boundary series was so amazing that I've gone back to re-read that series.

This is book three is the second trilogy and the story just keeps getting better. Molly and Jesse are back and important characters in this story. The big surprise is something that Scarlett never expected. That surprise drives this plot and causes no end of trouble. When Scarlett unexpectedly leaves town an old enemy arrives and starts to take revenge. This is a fast paced story that ends with a new relationship between Scarlett and Jesse. About time is all I can say. This does end the Disrupted Magic trilogy but I hope that we will see more of Scarlett and the world she lives in."}, {"userName": "Melindeeloo", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2766907-melindeeloo", "userReview": "4.5 stars - After a short prolog to introduce the villain, Shadow Hunt picks up pretty much at the point of the Big Bombshell revelation that ended the previous book and Scarlett and Molly scurry off to Lex's neck of the woods to gather more info on Scarlett's situation. She leaves Jesse in charge of Shadow and he gets caught in the crossfire and suddenly Scarlett's whole world is in danger.Boy was Shadow Hunt good. I have to admit that I never thought that I was going to like Scarlett as much as I do. She has really grown over the course of the series - I am not even sure that I liked her that much in the first book of the first series, Dead Spots. And I have grown quite attached to her and the supporting cast. I loved that author Olson used people from both Scarlet's LA and Lex's Boulder part of the world and that she tied somd side threads together for some of the characters. Then there is main story line which was action packed with plenty of peril for Scarlett, Jesse, and the LA Old World - I thought the myth based threat was very interesting. Shadow Hunt kept me turning pages until the end, leaving me satisfied but wanting more. I am not sure but I think the overall story arc may shift back to Lex who has a small but significant part in Shadow Hunt.Scarlett and Let's stories combine into a larger Old World framework.Starting with Scarlett's first seriesLex's booksBack to ScarlettMost of these are available on Kindle Unlimited.

This was my favorite of the Scarlett books. Olson has created an interesting and realistic shared world between the Scarlett and Lex books. She also has two awesome and badass female protagonists. That being said, I am much more fond of Scarlett and she gets quite the adventure here. This is a really great read with enough action and mystery to keep anyone entertained (there is even some romance thrown in if you like that sort of thing). It won't come out for a few more months, but when it does it is definitely worth your time. In the meantime, catch up on the other books in the series."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9697892-angie", "userReview": "**Copy provided through Netgalley for voluntary review.**Lots of forward progression in this book. And some squee-worthy moments. Olson isn't usually focused on the romance aspect but I loved it this time. I also loved Will's storyline at the end. Lots to smile about.

This book, in particular, was absolutely brutal in how bare and vulnerable it left Scarlett without her usual allies, but it was also uplifting to read about Scarlett persevering and changing. She's a fantastic urban fantasy heroine, and a rare one in that she is allowed to grow and change.#ShadowHunt #NetGalley"}, {"userName": "Fangs for the Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5912634-fangs-for-the-fantasy", "userReview": "Nulls are infertile. Everyone knows this. Scarlett certainly knows thisSo being pregnant was\u2026 unexpected to say the least and raised all kinds of implications which she has to learn about quicklyBut the luparii witches have arrived - they want their Barghest back (Scarlett\u2019s cute pet abomination) and more - they plan something big - possibly apocalyptic and Scarlett is the key to stopping it and likely much much more.I think this book represents a rather excellently timed shift. After two books that have established Scarlett\u2019s life, her relationships (fraught and in flux as they are), her friends, her purpose in the city and how she relates to the city\u2019s leadership, this book turns more outwards and even a little grander. While, at the same time, not necessarily pulling the focus from Scarlett or her more regional concernsThe arrival of the Luparii brings not only a sinister threat to the city to be hunted down before they bring carnage. They also represent the greater supernatural community, the wider supernatural politicsThe examination of null physiology, null breeding and how this relates to the witches also adds a much larger scale to the whole world, the nature of magic and the nature of the supernatural. It expands the world from a relatively narrow circle around Scarlett and puts and entirely new spin on it looking at her world and especially her place and importance within it. Again, it doesn\u2019t shift the focus but it does expand it far more with consequently raised stakesI also think it brings some really fascinating stakes to Scarlett herself. She\u2019s always been a good character - capable and strong without being wonder woman, confident without being too reckless (as far as urban fantasy protagonists go - let\u2019s face it this is a genre where everyone has major overdoses of recklessness) and she\u2019s caring without setting herself up as a martyr. She has friends but a lot of them she doesn\u2019t entirely trust especially within the supernatural community, while she also has some excellent, powerful friendships with people like Molly who are clearly in a very different mental category for her than her political allies.But now her very very personal decisions have such a broader context including for the future of all magical races and at a time where global supernatural politics just became very very confused and very subject to change. It is both very personal to her while also having vast implications which promises a whole lot of exciting storylines in the future.I think this works well with the renewed focus on both Scarlett dealing with her pregnancy and her reconnecting with her brother and considering the deep implications of him being involved in her life. While we\u2019re widening the lens we do have this excellent call back to Scarlett;s personal life so the focus of the story doesn\u2019t change entirely.The direct plot itself is a search and destroy - not so much a mystery as a hunt with a hidden enemy with considerable power. There\u2019s not a lot of questions as to motives or who is behind this but a lot of action and hunting and running. There is an unfortunate habit of the hunted protagonist deciding she really needs to wander around alone going on. But generally it\u2019s an exciting well paced plot full of sinister enemies and desperate good guys with a few fascinating twists which is always goodRead More"}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5052917-maggie", "userReview": "I take a point of for cliff hangers.

Yep, Scarlett is pregnant, everyone. Apparently it can happen when two nulls did the horizontal tango ... which happened with Scarlett and Jameson. So Scarlett is trying to find more information and thinking about what this pregnancy means for her, because let's face it, null baby is RARE, and it can be used by those who want to create world domination, so to speak. At the same time, old enemies, the Lupariis return to Los Angeles for revenge, kidnaps Shadow, hurt Jesse, threats Scarlett ... and well, you know, the usual fiasco.I really, REALLY, LOVED this series! I wish Olson writes faster because I want to read this world more than once or twice a year. Alas, I just have to be patient with her release schedule. As usual, \nShadow Hunt\n offers fast pace and engaging storyline. I LOVED how the Old World leaders of Los Angeles working together to fight against the Lupariis. I loved that some characters from Boundary Magic series making cross-over appearances, like Lex and Maven. We also have additional character whom I would love to see in the future, e.g. Owen. The final fight is EPIC, and while it has repercussion to the leadership structure, I think everyone will be all right... for now... One thing for sure, \nShadow Hunt\n for me is HEAPS better than Blood Gamble -- I was frustrated with Scarlett and her love choices back then. I wasn't sure with the pregnancy plot either. But here, well, I guess Olson proves that she has game plan for Scarlett's journey. At the end of this book I was very much content that Scarlett finally settles down with the one that has been there since the beginning. It all makes sense. Both Scarlett and Jesse are not the same person we first met all those years ago in Dead Spots. Both has LIFE happens to them, both has matured up. Scarlett is no longer passive. Jesse is no longer rigid about the Old World. They're strong on their own but even better together. I hope Olson fulfills her promise that Scarlett and Jesse will pop up here and there in Boundary Magic series... and that there'll be another trilogy about them.

If you have not read book two, BLOOD GAMBLE, do not continue to read my review as there will be spoilers for that book included. As we know from the ending of BLOOD GAMBLE, Scarlett brought a little something home with her from Vegas. SHADOW HUNT sends her on the hunt for answers about what the future will hold for her child. I loved watching Scarlett and Lex work together and it was neat seeing their worlds collide. I think those that have been frustrated with Scarlett and her choice of love interests in the past will be happy with the developments of SHADOW HUNT. Scarlett ends up with who I have always wanted her to be with and they're finally on the same page at the same time.The pace in SHADOW HUNT follows the same flow that we have always enjoyed from Melissa Olson.

OlsonReview from Jeannie Zelos book reviewsGenre: general fiction(adult), Sci-fi and Fantasy.I love this series, and the sister series set in the same world. It was that one, featuring Quinn and Lex that brought me the the Old World, and let me to buying more and being lucky enough to have some review ARCs too. I love Scarlett, she's in a tough and dangerous world, has to do things that her heart really isn't in, but which are necessary to protect others. It means she's alone though, having to keep family and human friends at a distance as they can and will be used to get to her. One of her few human friends from the early days is Jesse, and he's a human that's been allowed to know about the Old world because of the way he learned about it via his police job, and because Dasheil, Vampire leader for the city, feels he could be useful. Jesse is retired from the police now, but still very much friends with Scarlett and helps her when she needs assistance. I've always had a soft spot for Jesse, wanted him and Scarlett to be together but through the series its never been the right time for either and they have both been in other relationships, and just remained good, true friends. Its another exciting adventure, bringing into play characters, enemies Scarlett thought had been neutralised \u2013 or at least a truce reached with them. The attack, when it comes, is very unexpected, and once more its Scarlett and Jesse in the thick of things, rescuing those they love, and trying hard to prevent a massive tragedy and loss of life. We meet a few new characters, catch up from some from past stories and Maven, we learn a bit more about her too!
