It was a nice contrast and complement after \nThe Pillars of the Earth\n, as that book was set in a monastery in England and this one in a convent in France, though 500 years later. I have not read Chocolat by Harris, but of course I have seen the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it.This book is quite different\u2014much darker and without a satisfactory ending (in my opinion). I liked the character development of Juliette and the fact that she found peace and comunity at the island convent after her rather troubled past as a gypsy and circus performer. She sought refuge there after she realized she was pregnant, and for awhile she is able to lead a fairly restful life, raising her daughter, tending the herb garden, and teaching Latin to the novices. This all changes when LeMerle, a man from her past, arrives masquerading as a priest with the new strict abbess, with his own evil agenda.One of the most interesting tidbits of the book was that while the sculpture of the patron saint of the convent, Maire-de-la-mer, is said to be the Holy Mother, it is more than likely a mermaid. While another reviewer has pointed out that this church does not in fact exist, it made me think again how the pagan customs of local people were often merged into the Catholic belief system. It was akin to the blood oath at the Scottish marriage in Outlander by Gabaldon, as well as the Celtic practice that married monks were acceptable in Ireland long after such practices were banned elsewhere, as mentioned in Rutherford\u2019s The Princes of Ireland. This blending of the pagan and the holy pervades the book, manifested not just in the sculpture, but also in Juliette\u2019s herbal remedies as well as her surreptitious card readings to divine LeMerle\u2019s purpose at the convent. The mystery/thriller aspect of the book did keep me riveted, and I finished it in a few hours this afternoon by the pool. However, I felt the ending would have been better if Harris had finished after the final scene at the convent. Overall, I would recommend it as escapist summer reading, with a darker overtone."}, {"userName": "Nimue Brown", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6091697-nimue-brown", "userReview": "A gorgeous, compelling story set in mediaeval France, Holy Fools has all the ingredients I love in Joanne Harris\u2019s books. There\u2019s a strong, complex heroine with pagan inclinations, a few villains, a slightly gothic setting, and a lot of less than comfortable reflections on the human condition. Harris has a very warts and all approach to portraying people. She doesn\u2019t tend to do clear lines between the wholly good and the wholly bad, and I love this about her work.One of the themes running through this novel is that way in which people are often complicit in their own oppression. In trying to please the oppressor, and trying to avoid punishment, we give other names to the witch hunter. We accuse someone else to take attention from ourselves. So often what is called for in oppressive scenarios is a banding together to fight off the tyrant. If there\u2019s one tyrant and many people being mistreated, weight of numbers should fix it, but often it doesn\u2019t. Instead, in trying to protect ourselves, we uphold evil systems and support those who abuse us.This is a powerful story, the characters are many and brought to life with consummate skill. I am absolutely convinced that just reading Joanne Harris has the effect of making me a better author. I learn so much from her work, and am constantly aware that I have a lot of learning to do yet."}, {"userName": "Zahra Dashti", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20404423-zahra-dashti", "userReview": "\u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u0644\u0630\u062a \u0628\u062e\u0634\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f \u060c \u06a9\u0634\u0634 \u062e\u0648\u0628\u06cc \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a \u060c \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a \u0647\u0627\u06cc \u062c\u062f\u06cc\u062f \u0648 \u0628\u062f\u06cc\u0639 \u060c \u062a\u063a\u06cc\u06cc\u0631 \u062e\u0644\u0642 \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u06cc \u0634\u062e\u0635\u06cc\u062a \u0627\u0635\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631 \u0645\u0627\u062f\u0631 \u0634\u062f\u0646 \u0648 ....\u06a9\u0645\u06cc \u062c\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0627\u0646\u0647 \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0648\u062f. \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u062c\u0630\u0627\u0628\u06cc\u062a \u062e\u0627\u0635 \u062e\u0648\u062f\u0634 \u0631\u0648 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a \u0627\u0645\u0627 \u0636\u0639\u0641 \u0647\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a \u060c \u0633\u0631\u0639\u062a \u0648\u0642\u0627\u06cc\u0639 \u0628\u0647 \u0646\u0638\u0631\u0645 \u06a9\u0645\u06cc \u0632\u06cc\u0627\u062f \u0628\u0648\u062f \u060c \u0627\u0632 \u0637\u0631\u0641\u06cc \u0645\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0627\u062a\u0641\u0627\u0642\u0627\u062a \u0648 \u062a\u0648\u0636\u06cc\u062d\u0634\u0648\u0646 \u062e\u06cc\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u06cc\u0634 \u0627\u0632 \u0627\u06cc\u0646 \u062a\u0648\u0636\u06cc\u062d \u0644\u0627\u0632\u0645 \u062f\u0627\u0634\u062a. \u0628\u0639\u0636\u06cc \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f\u0634 \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0648\u0644\u06cc \u0628\u0639\u0636\u06cc \u0647\u0627\u0634 \u0631\u0648 \u06a9\u0645 \u062a\u0648\u0636\u06cc\u062d \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u0648 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0642\u0627\u0646\u0639 \u0646\u0645\u06cc \u0634\u062f. \u0627\u0644\u0628\u062a\u0647 \u0686\u0648\u0646 \u06a9\u062a\u0627\u0628 \u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0628\u0648\u062f \u060c \u0634\u0627\u06cc\u062f \u0647\u0645 \u0628\u0639\u0636\u06cc \u0645\u0648\u0627\u0631\u062f \u062a\u0648\u0636\u06cc\u062d \u062f\u0627\u062f\u0647 \u0646\u0634\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0627\u0637\u0631 \u0645\u0645\u06cc\u0632\u06cc \u0648 ...\u062a\u0631\u062c\u0645\u0647 \u0647\u0645 \u062e\u0648\u0628 \u0648 \u0631\u0648\u0627\u0646 \u0628\u0648\u062f.\u062f\u0631 \u06a9\u0644 \u062f\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0627\u0646 \u067e\u0631\u06a9\u0634\u0634 \u0648 \u062c\u0630\u0627\u0628\u06cc \u0628\u0648\u062f ."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5524769-sarah", "userReview": "Although I really enjoy reading Harris\u2019s works, I\u2019m beginning to wonder if she has something against the Catholic church. In the majority of the books I\u2019ve read written by her, someone or something from the Catholic church ends up being the baddie, and the Church itself is inevitably portrayed as corrupted and judgmental. I\u2019m not Catholic, but I\u2019d hope that someone who is as lovely an author as she is could branch out a little in her pool for villains.This book, while still engaging in much magical realism, isn\u2019t quite as engaging as some of her other works. It tells the story of Juliette \u2013 a former wire walker (a type of acrobatic tight-rope walker) who has abandoned her old life in order to take care of her daughter. She has chosen an out-of-the-way monastery by the ocean in order to do this and has reinvented herself as Sister Auguste. When her past comes back to haunt her in the form of a man she once loved, Juliette must use all her wits and courage in order to save her daughter and the nuns she has come to care for.For some reason, I couldn\u2019t precisely enjoy this story as much as any of Harris\u2019s others. Juliette was interesting, and the suspense built throughout the book was extraordinary\u2026but I never felt quite confident in what was going on. It was as if I never felt in step with the characters. They were there on the page for me to get to know, but I wasn\u2019t interested in them. The story was great, and the setting, and the characters, but it just lacked the zip to hold my interest."}, {"userName": "Saleh MoonWalker", "userReviewDate": "Jul 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66648866-saleh-moonwalker", "userReview": "Onvan : Holy Fools - Nevisande : Joanne Harris - ISBN : 60559128 - ISBN13 : 9780060559120 - Dar 368 Safhe - Saal e Chap : 2003"}, {"userName": "Dorottya", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15478679-dorottya", "userReview": "Not at all what I anticipated (from the blurb I have read online, I was expecting it to be more of a theatre based story), but I loved it either way.I loved all the twists and turns in the story, and the fact I could never be sure what to think about each character other than Juliette, our main narrator, because everything that seemed to be true was uncovered to be false... especially behaviours of certain people.What the novel said about sin, behaviours of people who are not void of sins, what we choose to believe in, about motherhood and motherly instincts, jealousy etc. was so deeply rooted in real psychology, thus it hit hard for me because of its genuinity. To be honest, I see certain behavioural patterns portrayed in the book more present in today's era THAN EVER. Getting petty revenge on people who ridicule us. Believing in and giving their trust to the people who are cunning and who can sell themselves (if they are attractive, it does not hurt, right?). Using gullible and/or young and inexperienced people to reach one's goal. Suspecting the \"weird\" people when something is going wrong. People seemingly getting along nicely playing each other out to be near the fire.(not to even talk about how eerily the \"theatre part\" is resonating with the big abuse scandal of Hollywood... you would have thought we have reached a point where actresses are not treated as prostitutes to prominent men...)But I also liked how religious communities in good times were shown. I do think this was drawn from reality, too - how they sometimes act as refuge for those whose lives seem irrepairable.I liked how the villain was villanous and someone who love to hate with this enigmatic evilness in him - but at the same time, he was not an empty shell, and he had the motivation and a background that can explain his behaviour partly... and also, he was not without emotions. I also loved how our main heroine was not perfectly good, but likeable. I don't have children, but I think I can understand her decisions in th light of her wanting to save her daughter, for which goal she is ready to commit sins. And I also think I understood the dynamics of her relatinship with LeMerle. I can imagine that there is that sort of (partly emotional, partly sexual) passion/attraction that is really hard to break even though you know the other person is only going to cause you misery.Plus... yes, the theatre parts were a huge plus for me as someone whose biggest passion in life is theatre... or at least one of the bigger passions.

I loved \"Chocolat\", and I adored \"Five Quarters of the Orange\". \"Holy Fools\", however, seems like it came from a completely different author. The book is acceptable, but not up to Harris' standards. To start, the Mother-Daughter theme that Harris employs so well is deeply underdeveloped here as more of a plot device than anything else. There was a lot of potential here: a nun with a beloved daughter, raising her to be safe from the outside world and yet perhaps a little too sheltered. Unfortunately, the daughter seems a little underdeveloped - neither rebellious and wanting to know the curiosities of the outside world nor a little too content in her cocoon. Instead, the daughter seems only to exist to serve as a kidnap/hostage victim so that our heroine cannot effectively flee or intervene when the madness begins. I could accept the \"daughter as hostage\" plot device, were the main character not so otherwise one-dimensional. The evil mustache-twirling villain has abused her in numerous ways, and yet she seems intently less interested in bearing a grudge and more intent on mooning her way back into his bed. Once there, however, it never seems to occur to our heroine to tie him up and \"persuade\" him to tell her the secret location of her kidnapped daughter; instead, she just focuses on having a nice tumble and heading off cheerily the next morning. The lackluster narrative conflicts deeply with the established character of the narrator - she's been shown to have great survival skills and would manage easily on her own with the child outside the nunnery, so why does it not even occur to her to take a runner? Harris' crisp insight into females isn't just lost on our heroine. All the women in this novel are almost irredeemable idiots. The nuns descend almost instantly into madness under the manipulation of the villain. This isn't presented as religious hysteria; the women seem either intensely stupid or completely eager to join the villain for their own selfish reasons. The subtlety necessary for religious hysteria seems completely absent here, which is astonishing because I believe that if anyone could have pulled it off, Harris could have. Again, what happened here? This isn't a bad novel. It's got enough cliches to shake a stick at, and it's incredibly frustrating at bits, but so are many decent novels. But this *is* a bad novel for Harris. You may enjoy this, if you check it out at a library, but don't expect Harris quality. In the end, I didn't hate it, but I was deeply disappointed.~ Ana Mardoll"}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1956252-nancy", "userReview": "Joanne Harris can spin a tale! I was totally captivated by this magical, medieval story that follows two adversaries who both love and vie with each other. Juliette is a high-wire artist who was raised as a gypsy. She seeks refuge at the Abbey of Sainte Marie-de-la-mer when she becomes pregnant with her baby Fleur. She enjoys the quiet life there, tending her herbs, etc., until she once again comes in contact with the Blackbird, the conniving and cruel, yet charming Guy LeMerle, who shows up disguised as P\u00e8re Colombin de Saint-Amand, confessor to the newly appointed abbess. Juliette and LeMerle have been both lovers and antagonists and their relationship is the central theme of Harris\u2019 story. They are like magnets, the positive and negative aspects of their personalities pulling them together and thrusting them apart as they battle each other while at the same time respecting the other\u2019s moves.Set in 17th century France when internal conflicts beset the Catholic church, the story is both theatrical and intense. Harris keeps the reader\u2019s attention with the developing intrigue between her two main characters. One is never quite sure how LeMerle will manipulate events and if Juliette will continue to be a victim or emerge victorious. She knows LeMerle\u2019s favors always come with a price and the story reaches a turning point when she realizes that pride is all he has.This is the fourth Joanne Harris book I\u2019ve read and I have yet to be disappointed."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26388534-michelle", "userReview": "Magical tale based around one woman's travels and trials in the 17th century.

She is loved and valued by her sisters in faith, as much for her skills with medicinal plants as for her sweet and kindly nature. But Soeur Auguste is hiding a secret. She is not the impoverished widow of her \u2018cover story,\u2019 but Juliette, a one-time gypsy and circus performer, forced by the betrayal of a man she loved to seek refuge in holy orders. For the first five years of Fleur\u2019s life, all goes well, and if Juliette feels at all restless and confined in her new life, the joy she has in her daughter and her friendship with the Abbess and some of the other nuns more than make up for it. But then the old Abbess dies, and her successor is the eleven-year-old daughter of a corrupt and noble family, fanatically bent on reform. Worse still, the new Abbess has brought as her confessor and guiding priest an imposter with an evil agenda of his own. Pere Colombin is none other than Guy LeMerle (the Blackbird) the man who betrayed Juliette five years earlier. To survive in the new order and protect those she cares about, Juliette has no choice but to fight LeMerle in an increasingly dangerous battle of wits that, ultimately, only one of them can survive. The book starts sweetly, if a little slowly, as we alternate between Juliette\u2019s life in the abbey and her recollections of an earlier time on the road. It was no charmed existence: she was orphaned, separated from her adopted family, driven to begging and prostitution to survive, used selfishly by the man she loved and finally abandoned to an almost certain death. And yet, Harris captures the rich, heady essence of 17th century gypsy life in the way that, to my mind, Stef Penney completely failed to do for its 20th century equivalent in The Invisible Ones. Harris paints a wonderful, colourful picture; not a pretty one, by any means, but one completely compelling. What might be disappointing for Harris fans is that the character of Juliette can seem rather too similar to that of Vianne Rocher (Chocolat, The Lollipop Shoes and Peaches for Monsieur Le Cure) and to some extent that of Framboise (Five Quarters of The Orange. There was a sense, in the Juliette-narrated chapters, of going over old ground but the book comes to life gloriously with the entrance of Guy LeMerle, a fascinatingly immoral creation, who values others only in that they can be of use to him or amuse him and who remains irrepressible and unrepentant till the end. The follies of organized religion are themes that Harris refers to frequently in her work, but in no other book is the danger of denying natural human impulses more thoroughly explored than in this. The convent seethes with the stench of repressed sexuality and resonates with the frustrations of lives left unsatisfied. The abbey is like dry kindling in the hot sun. One spark and everything is set to erupt. Harris shows the freefall into disorder perfectly. The simple country nuns soon become confused, attention seeking, spiteful and, ultimately, hysterical under the twin influences of LeMerle\u2019s mischief and the Abbess\u2019s misplaced zeal. We can only watch with dismay. The Holy Fools is probably not the best of Harris\u2019s books, but given that her \u201cworst\u201d would still be streets ahead of the best of most other writers, it\u2019s well worth a read."}, {"userName": "Jeanette", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11869072-jeanette", "userReview": "Well written.

They didn't connect with me as much as they did within the former Harris books I have read. It's still an excellent tale and I'm sure quite possible too.But I do find that there is a rather revisionist slant to sensibilities here that doesn't sit well within the period of the child King Louie. And not only in the depiction of Catholicism itself either. Abbeys and convents, monasteries- all religious orders \"on the road\" as well- were certainly a mixed bag. But the sense of amorality so developed that it is named in Sister by herself? Says a whole more about the author than it does for and about the story line, IMHO.

Juliette shares a lot of characteristics with Vianne; Fleur with Anouk. Juliette's cantrips and her herbs are very reminiscent of Vianne. LeMerle is very like Mose from Sleep, Pale Sister. Etc.

Juliette is appalled to recognize Pere Columbin as La Merle, who had used her and then abandoned her in the hands of witch hunters. She immediately decides to flee, but discovers she has been forestalled; her beloved daughter has disappeared and she knows La Merle has abducted her. With Fleur in La Merle's hands, Juliette is compelled to cooperate in the Blackbird's schemes until she can devise a counter scheme to free herself, her daughter and her fellow nuns. What follows will fascinate and tantalize even the most sophisticated and jaded readers. This book has it all, from gypsy caravans to glittering courts, to the salt marshes of Brittany, we find sensuous sex, revenge both cold and hot, malice, thwarted love, intrigue, arrogance and maternal tenderness. The author is exceptionally skilled at creating atmosphere: the reader can feel the dankness in the dungeons and smell the salt winds from the sea. I have enjoyed previous novels from this author, but this one just swept me away to 1605, to a France so real that I still seem to feel it."}, {"userName": "Kay", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11396094-kay", "userReview": "Why oh why did I keep reading this book? I thought it would get better and I got caught up in the characters. I regret the time spent! It was interesting yes, the time period of 1610 which I know nothing about. And I got taken in by the mysterious Juliette with her secrets hiding out in an out of the way abbey. I found the writing difficult to follow. The main parts divided into 4 characters. BUT sometimes the narration in those parts was not that character so the reader needed to figure out who was who. (ok maybe it is easier if I hadn't been half asleep while reading). I also absolutely hated the ending. Why or why did the Juliette have to be so stupid??? I did like how the author named the book and brought the title into the story. That was well done. I don't think I'll read this author again."}, {"userName": "Karschtl", "userReviewDate": "Nov 24, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/321508-karschtl", "userReview": "This thriller wasn't really thrilling. The only thing that made me keep reading was that I wanted to know if Juliette will be reunited with her daughter Fleur in the end. Although I'm not a mother yet I can understand her loss. In the second part the story condensed and quickened, and therefore became a bit more interesting.I didn't like the very ending, though. Cannot understand Juliettes decision on the last page.I must admit that I don't like historic novles much in general, and it's quite coincidence that now I read two (also read Pompeii) in one month, AND both are by authors named Harris. I liked \"Pompeii\" better, and I even more liked Chocolat by Joanne Harris - probably because of the topic.

There is no father. There's a young mute woman, a woman who is self-righteous in her religion, a man who is a rogue but all the women are attracted to him. Do these characters seem familiar?

Set in a small convent on the French coast during a hot summer in 1610, she steadily builds an atmosphere of madness and intrigue, and ratchets up the tension by steady increments to build towards a powerful climax.What isn't always noticed is how big a part structure plays in this process.
