A must read!"}, {"userName": "Betsy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/221050-betsy", "userReview": "Because I'm a librarian I like to slot books into distinct categories. Alphabet book. Concept book. Emotions book. So on. Other people like it too. That's why I keep a file of different lists of books by topic at my reference desk. There are some books that don't fit into any category, and that's fine. They're cool. They prove that the publishing industry today allows for creativity. Then there's a third category; books that belong to categories where they are the sole occupants. Meet Do You Know Which Ones Will Grow by Susan Shea. If I were going to label its category it would be \"Interactive picture books that set up false pretenses so that kids can knock `em down\". That's a lot of words, but that's okay. I like books that make you work a bit, and the delight of this title is that aside from the great art, it's an original and fun premise. The lift-the-flap meets the concept book.\"If you look around you'll see, / Some things grow like you and me.\" Kids know that they're growing but what else does so? With rhyming text Susan Shea asks kids if one thing grows, will another? For example, \"If a cub grows and becomes a bear can a stool grow and become . . .\" Lift the flap and the stool elongates as the text finishes with \"a chair?\". Time and again living things are paired with inanimate and the readers are asked if they will grow. Finally at the end of the book all is made clear (\"Yes to cows. Yes to snakes. No to plows. No to cakes.\") With great panache the book is an entirely new look at growing things and what it means to be more than just big.We generally associate lift-the-flap books with the very youngest of cogent readers. When I do a toddler storytime, I like to include one lift-the-flap book, partly because there's no replicating the look of sheer surprise on a kid's face when they see a page shift and change. I get a kick out of that. Yet there's nothing saying that the magic of lift-the-flap leaves a kid when they enter preschool and beyond. The act of reading a paper book is an act of continual discovery. With every lift of a page, you have a story progress in time. Lifting a flap is very much the same kind of activity, except in this case you are revealing a truth that is both part and not part of that particular page. In the case of Shea's book, the flaps reveal untruths, in a sense. The flaps sometimes reveal something true, but generally they're showing things that are false.Is this a problem? That's the real concern with the book, I guess. Some parents might worry that the book is teaching their kids that caps grow into hats and all that. Sure, there's a portion at the end where all becomes clear, but by the time you get back there, wouldn't \"the damage be done\"? Not as such. It's important to note, though, that the book isn't telling you that a shovel will become a plow or a watch a clock. Rather they're asking the reader. It's allowing a certain level of interaction between the parents and their children. A kid is asked \"if this, then this?\" And as the parent goes through it with the kid they can correct them themselves. Some people feel that a book for kids has to do all the work for you. Really interesting children's books, however, allow for the child to be more than just a passive consumer. They're actively engaged, particularly when they get to reject something. Why do you think books like Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus do so well? Because at long last the child reader gets to do to a book what is done to them regularly; they get to say \"no\".Then there's this Tom Slaughter fellow. When you read his short biography on the back flap of the book you can see that amongst his many accomplishments \"his prints are in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.\" Makes sense. Looking at the cover of this book it resembles those children's books you see cluttering up the shelves in fancy museum gift shops more than anything else. You wouldn't necessarily think it was going to please anyone much beyond the trendy parental shopper. Yet Slaughter has a style that actually makes anyone and everyone happy. His lift-the-flap reveals are clever, sure, but they're also uniquely colorful. Primary colors are the name of the game in this little outing. One is reminded of fellow children's illustrator Laura Vaccaro Seeger (she of such books as Lemons Are Not Red, which this title resembles to a certain extent), though the cut paper style Slaughter utilizes is very clearly his own. So really, it's the ultimate creation. The title that pleases both adults and kids equally.Functional insofar as any picture book can be said to have a function, Do You Know Which Ones Will Grow? really is one heckuva quality product. Fun and attractive. Consistently interesting with enough interactive qualities to engage even the most lethargic of kids, the pairing of Shea and Slaughter really knock his puppy out of the park. If you're looking for something to engage a clever kid and a bored adult, this may be your best bet. It fires on all cylinders. A keeper.For ages 4-8."}, {"userName": "Elizabeth\u262e ", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/990216-elizabeth", "userReview": "What a clever little book!

There are many pictures on it that are featured later in the story. The story begins by telling the reader that there are items that grow, like humans, and other that stay the same until they crack, rust, or fade. Then readers are asked the question \"do you know which ones will grow\"? As you read through the book you will see many animals and their babies. The book discusses how they start off as a baby and become adults. One example is that a duckling becomes a duck. The other aspect of the book uses objects and compares them to the growing animals, such as a car becoming a truck. Halfway through the book the author answers the question can it grow and the story continues. As previously mentioned the cover of this story is colorful and the same is true for the pages inside. Each page is filled with multiple colors. The pictures are simplistic and it is easy for a young reader to identify the various animals and objects. The most exciting feature of the book are the lift up flaps. Almost every page contains a flap that you can lift up to reveal a bigger picture below. Children will enjoy this feature and will want to take turns lifting the flap. This book using rhyming to make the book more enjoyable and easier to read. You could potentially use the rhyming to teach a lesson or use the book to add on to what has already been taught. The words and pictures work together to create the story.

SheaIllustrator: Tom SlaughterGenre: Lift-The-FlapTheme(s): Animals, Life cycle, Living vs. non livingOpening line/sentence: That Spot! He hasn\u2019t eaten his supper. Where can he be?Brief Book Summary: This story is about the growth and development of animals, living things and non living things. It distinguishes between learning about the difference between the three and then applying that learning to each page and flap. Each page asks a question such as what the cow will grow into and when you open the flap the answer is under it. Professional Recommendation/Review #1 :Kirkus Reviews (April 3, 2011)Shea\u2019s children\u2019s-book debut is a clever, rhymed test of kids\u2019 notions of living and nonliving things that's great for both lap and group sharing. \u201cIf you look around you\u2019ll see, / Some things grow, like you and me\u2026 / Do you know which ones will grow? / Think, then answer yes or no.\u201d What follows is a terrific interplay of rhyming questions and cunningly designed gatefold illustrations: \u201cIf a calf grows and becomes a cow, / can a shovel grow and become\u2026/ a plow?\u201d The left side pictures the cows, while the right-hand page shows a huge shovel and pail. A flip of the fold reveals the corner of the shovel becoming a part of a truck-mounted plow. Other rhymes include duck and truck, bear and chair, cat and hat, goat and coat, towel and owl, snake and cake, pig and rig, fox and clock and kangaroo and you. The final two pages summarize the answers, still keeping the rhythm and rhyme. Slaughter\u2019s illustrations bring pop art to mind: vivid reds, blues, yellows and greens, few details, simple backgrounds and blocks of color. Many of the objects are cut-paper silhouettes against a painted background. Between its allure as an audience-participation read-aloud and its numerous classroom uses (living/nonliving, analogies, rhymes, spelling rules, baby animal names, creative thinking\u2026) clear a space on the shelves for this one, even though it may never be there for long. (Picture book. 4-8) Professional Recommendation/Review #2:Publishers Weekly(March 28, 2011)Slaughter's brightly colored cut-paper shapes and newcomer Shea's verse recall favorites of 50 years ago\u2014a feeling reinforced by this book's matte pages, blocky images, and fun-to-flip gatefolds. \"If a duckling grows/ and becomes a duck,/ can a car grow and become...\" reads the text on facing pages; children will be able to guess what's coming even before the gatefold opens\u2014\"a truck?\" Slaughter (Which Way?) revels in paint-box primaries, pushing reds, greens, yellows, and blues up against each other for maximum visual charge. The gatefolds break in interesting places\u2014halfway down a garment hanging on a hanger, for example, turning a floral sweater into a full-length coat\u2014and contain the occasional die-cut, too. Shea's verses scan consistently and gracefully. \"YES to ducks, bears, and owls./ NO to trucks, chairs, and towels,\" she writes, reinforcing the idea that living things grow but inanimate objects don't. The beauty of the rhymes is that they teach a lesson children already know; children will relish the fun of being sure of all the answers, and they'll love Shea's tongue-in-cheek tone. Ages 4\u2013up. Response to Two Professional Reviews: Both of the reviews describe the importance of using rhyming while also learning which objects are real and which are not. They both explain that the author of the story did a wonderful job in using imaginative images, animals and pictures that flip open in order to allow the children to become engaged and learn. This book seemed to tell a story while at the same time allowing children to learn about the difference between objects that are real and objects that are not. Evaluation of Literary Elements: There is many elements in this story that make it very appealing to read in an elementary school classroom. For such a simple book it contains valuable information that will help children differentiate between objects that are real and objects that are not. By having each page contain different attractive pictures of objects and by using so many different colors children will be drawn to these images and learn at the same time. They will remember the information better because of the rhyming words as well as the lift-a-flap part of the book. Consideration of Instructional Application:This book would be an amazing resource to have in my future classroom. There is so many activities one can do when reading this book with their class. Immediately while reading this book I thought of the idea that after the children completed the story for homework that night they would have to bring in objects that are real and objects that are not as well as explaining the difference. Children will clearly gain valuable information from this book and then be able to apply it by physically bringing in objects."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1103021-beth", "userReview": "This was recommended to me by one of my coworkers (a children's librarian) when I was looking for good books for my five-year-old.

By Susan Shea paintings by Tom Slaughter (Blue Apple Books, 2011) 36p. Concept Book. Summary: This is a book that compares inanimate objects with animate objects. It teaches children the difference between things that will grow and things that will not grow. For example a stool cannot grow, while a duckling grows into a duck. Critique: a. This is a fun and interesting book that helps children learn things that will grow and things that will not grow. It is written in a way that it asks questions to the children. The book has colorful pictures and many of the pages actually fold out. This is a good way to teach what is an inanimate object and what isn\u2019t. b. The pictures throughout the book are good. Every other page throughout the book has a flip out page which will keep children interested in the book. On one page it shows an example of something that will grow while the opposite page shows something that will not grow. After several pages of comparing it then has a page of answers. c. On page 13 and 14 it explains the answers of which objects will and will not grow from the previous pages questions. For example on page 11 is the question \u201cIf an owlet grows and becomes an owl\u201d page 12 (which folds out) says \u201cCan a washcloth grow and become a towel?\u201d Curriculum Connection: This would be a good way to teach younger children the difference in living and nonliving or what inanimate objects are.

Shea\u2019s first novel. The book is illustrated by Tom Slaughter. The book sets out to ask readers which items grow and is tailored for children who know they are growing bigger. The book features items like bear cubs, baseball caps, stools, and fox kits. The text on each page is structured as rhyming text. Children will enjoy answering the questions such as: Does a car grow to become a truck? (Children really like answering questions like this.) Each page also offers a lift the flap that show the item growing bigger. Much like other picture books that offer questions that readers can respond with yes or no, My Lil Guy at age 2 loves to shout Yes or No to these predictable questions. He enjoyed this book and he always enjoys opening lift the flap books. At age 2, I prefer board books for lift the flap books for him. We are pretty much past ripping of pages, but board books are just more durable! The illustrations by Slaughter are bright and color, appealing to preschoolers and toddlers, but also to the art minded parent. The bold shapes and intense colors kind of remind me or Henri Matisse\u2019s paper cut outs. (What do you think?)Matisse's Jazz (1947)This is a book that thinks outside the box. It was unexpected to find a non-fiction book with such captivating illustrations that will also engage little ones. I look forward to more books from this author and illustrator Slaughter.

Throughout the book there are different animals compared to object such as a cub which turns into a bear as it grows, compared to a stool that could not turn into a chair. This story has pictures that open up to become something new, which can really get the students involved and excited. Also, instead of just saying which things will grow and which will not, the book asks the question can this object turn into this. The students are engaged throughout the story and encouraged to use their cognitive skills to figure out what can grow and what cannot.I actually am writing a lesson plan based on a kindergarten science standard of being able to identify living and non-living things. I think that this book would be great to include in my lesson because growing is part of living. I can assess my students by having them answer the questions in the book and then relate the standard of living and non-living to the objects that can grow and the ones that can't. I could also have my students act out a living object and then act out a non-living object in front of the class, or I could just simply ask them to talk to a neighbor and share a living thing (which can grow) and a non-living thing (which cannot grow)."}], "description": "Do you know about Grow's glow?
