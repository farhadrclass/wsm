However, I think gay fiction is a more apt description than gay erotic romance.There were several men revolving around Miguel that made me unsure of just who was going to end up paired together for a good portion of the beginning of the book.Charlie, the one night stand comes and goes quickly and Rob, his new police partner is difficult to like at the best of times. I didn't have to wait long to rule him out as the potential sexual partner. Plus, the picture on the cover paired Miguel and Nicolai. So, I was pretty sure it was going to be Miguel and Nicolai but there was really no sexual chemistry between them for 90% of the book. The only sex and real talk of any kind of coupledom in the book comes in the last 30 pages of the 265 pages of the book and it's kinda unsatisfying. 5 pages out of 265 just seems more like an add in to make it \"erotic\" than anything else. I mean, after such an investment I expected more of a solid payoff. And I really, really didn't like the ending when Nicolai tries to explain to a grieving mother what happened. For all the drama and revelations that Miguel goes through and for having so many missing kids the ending was abrupt and completely not resolved. Not in the manner any police force would accept, including Rob. However, although Rob is around almost as much as Nicolai, we don't see him again in the last 40 pages of the book or so and it seems odd to just end without any closure there. Finally, some of the things that Miguel flashbacks to as a part of his time in the army and the way he allowed a terrible problem to be resolved is disturbing and the mystery of the missing kids has a child molestation scenario. It's an absorbing and well written book with interesting underlying theme that I have not encountered before. I found that portion very fascinating."}, {"userName": "M'rella", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3395287-m-rella", "userReview": "3.5, rounding up to 4.Very well written, but the tags are misleading, even tho there is a mystery, there is a paranormal angle, there is military and flashbacks of combat and the bombing, there is also a romance, but just the beginning of it. All of these bits and pieces, even Nikolai, are in the book for Miguel and Miguel alone.This book is a character study. It's all about Miguel and his spiritual and emotional healing and journey. At the end of the book Miguel evolves, which has a direct impact on his relationship with Nikolai. And that's where the book ends.A huge minus for me was the use of Yiddish. Sure, there is a glossary in the end, but flipping pages back and forth is a nuisance. All the author needed to do was to tell us that Nikolai's speech is peppered with Yiddish proverbs and expressions. I honestly don't know a single person (a non English speaker) who would speak such a weird mixture of English and their native language. Saying something that no one understands is like talking to yourself. It defeats the purpose of a conversation where multiple people are involved, not to mention it's plain rude. A star off for that."}, {"userName": "Ami", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/134600-ami", "userReview": "Lyn Gala is one of my friend\u2019s favorite authors \u2013 unfortunately she also writes in genres that I don\u2019t particularly enjoy, namely sci-fi, sometimes with BDSM content. This is one of the big reasons why, so far, I have only read one published contemporary book of hers. Currently, I am in a phase of trying to read older releases of MM books, and I stumbled onto this one (digging deep to my \u2018unread\u2019 folder in my computer *haha*). Skimming some reviews I saw that this has no BDSM content (yes!) and offered a combination of supernatural, urban fantasy, and mystery. Come to mama!!The story follows Miguel Rassin\u2019s perspective as he is involved in a case of missing kids on Tremont, in a Bronx neighborhood where the people distrust cops and are unwilling to cooperate even a little bit with the police\u2019s attempts to find the kids. In the center of the community, however, is a doctor who is considered as their shaman. Nikolai Adelman might be the strangest person Miguel ever encountered, and he couldn\u2019t understand the fact that Nikolai seems to be befriended and respected by his own Captain. Miguel\u2019s partner, Rob, suspects that Nikolai is pulling a con and that the shaman has something to do with the missing children. Especially when he is starting to sprout nonsensical brou-ha-ha like magic and spirits. However, Miguel couldn\u2019t escape the fact that he seemed to be drawn towards Nikolai.I found the story to be fascinating \u2013 basically due to the interaction and interconnection between Miguel and the rest of the people through Nikolai. Nikolai confuses Miguel but intrigues him at the same time. I wholeheartedly enjoyed the way that Nikolai talked about magic, shamanism, the way of the world \u2026 heck, even when he is trying to analyze Miguel\u2019s emotional pain. He is weird, and he is frustrating, but because of that I found Nikolai amusing. Which is probably the key element for me through the whole story because it is written solely from Miguel\u2019s perspective. But because of that, I walked along the journey with Miguel, and at the same time I could also observed Miguel, as he slowly opened his mind from being a complete skeptic into someone who realizes that there might be something unexplainable in the universe he lives in. For me, that was one hell of a journey.My friend \u2013 who ended up disliking this book \u2013 told me that she didn\u2019t like the way that the people acted around the cops. How they seemed to stall the police investigation. However, for me, I actually found that another entertaining aspect. To be honest, I am not exactly a huge fan of authority. I\u2019m not saying that I want to create riots and anarchy (I\u2019m NOT that rebellious *lol*) but for me, respect is something that must be earned and not simply because of one\u2019s title or role. Because of that, I enjoyed how the people made the detectives work harder to make them cooperate. In that aspect, Miguel is able to at least talk to them because he is willing to hear what Nikolai was saying about the community dynamic, even if he doesn\u2019t necessarily believe in it, which earns their trust.I found the rest of the characters to be engaging as well \u2013 this includes Miguel\u2019s harsh partner, Rob. Miguel calls Rob \u201ca sledgehammer\u201d \u2013 he might not be racist or homophobic, he just hates people (especially those he deems as stupid) in general. Rob doesn\u2019t back away from \u201cverbal evisceration or humiliation\u201d if he feels that it will yield the most results. But at the same time, Miguel also learns that Rob will never stab people in the back. His way of confrontation is honest and in your face. I found Rob to be a uniquely refreshing character.I found the conclusion of the story to be rather sad, though. I understand that it fits with the whole magic and supernatural aspect, but I wish that it could be solved in a different way. I also thought that the ending felt somewhat rushed. I wanted more pages to tidy up things a little bit.By the way, this book lacks in the romance department \u2013 our MCs don\u2019t even share a kiss until about 88% and there is only one sexual content; even that one scene is only brief frottage rather than anal penetration. So consider this a reader\u2019s advisory for those who prefer to have heavy romance and/or smut substance. However, if you\u2019re not particularly adamant about that, and ready to dive into a character-driven storyline with a mix of mystery as well as shamanism/magic/supernatural as well as race/community dynamic, then by all means, give Urban Shaman a try."}, {"userName": "Kassa", "userReviewDate": "May 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2095317-kassa", "userReview": "4.5 starsUrban Shaman is a breath of fresh air in the m/m genre. The story is fabulously unique, immediately engaging, and very interesting despite the heavy mysticism and philosophy leanings. It isn\u2019t really a romance though and it definitely isn\u2019t an erotic romance. There are hints of romance but the story is really about relationships in general in a vivid urban setting. The writing and depth of characterization carries the story from start to finish and there are a few very mild hanging threads at the end. If you\u2019re looking for a great book with well defined characters, a fascinating topic, a dash of mystery, a dash of romance, and a graphic urban setting, hopefully you\u2019ll love this as much as I did. The story starts off with the kidnapping of a young child in NYC. Miguel Rassin is a cop with a bad history in the community and he\u2019s partnered with a hard nosed, take no prisoners detective to investigate the disappearances. With seven children missing, the community is scared and not talking leaving Miguel and his partner frustrated and anxious. The community is watched over by a local shaman, Nikolai Adleman. Nikolai seems totally out of place with his contradictory appearance, confusing way of speaking, and complete belief in magic, but he\u2019s just as determined to find the missing children. When Miguel is ordered to listen to Nikolai instead of dismissing him as insane rambling, Miguel slowly finds that maybe all of Nikolai\u2019s talk of magic and shaman rites is not so crazy. The plot is character driven with the missing children mystery as the vehicle to look at different relationships between people. The resolution to the police case is actually one of the weaker aspects and is resolved in part by police work and in part with mysticism. But the resolution is almost not important by that point and just a way to close up that loose thread. Really the story is a study and look at how people relate to each through the eyes of a total skeptic, Miguel, as he views a complete believer Nikolai. The story follows Miguel\u2019s third person point of view as he sees those around him from his by the book, bull in a china shop partner to the community with drug dealers and poor tenants and finally Nikolai in all his confusing and intriguing glory. Miguel is really wonderful as a cop with a past. He had a traumatic end to his military career and is plagued with endless guilt, shame, and anger at the events that happened around him in Iraq. He\u2019s angry at his own fellow soldiers who took advantage of the people and actually identifies with a young child suicide bomber. He feels a lot of guilt and shame at siding with the child and his feelings are a complicated, intricate mix. He also is dealing with severe negative backlash from a recent shooting incident which he was cleared for but the media won\u2019t let die. Miguel is a total skeptic and frequently wonders if Nikolai is a conman, on drugs, mentally unbalanced, or simply touched in the head. His slow discovery of understanding the man, who he is and why he does what he does forms the real driving force of the story. This understanding is really fascinating and it ties in a wealth of topics. Nikolai is a genuine believer and practitioner of magic. He calls himself the shaman of the tribe, his community. He is also very complicated and wonderfully interesting as he understands the dark side just as well as the light. He doesn\u2019t consider himself a good person but he knows he\u2019s a good shaman. He can help people but often in ways that leave him battered and unpopular. Despite this, his community comes together to help him and protect him. Everyone from the drug dealers to the religious respect Nikolai and his abilities and the story shows Miguel slowly starting to understand why. Their relationship is often tense and uncomfortable when their views clash, yet a mutual respect forms that eventually leads to romance. The issues brought up from mysticism to religion, philosophy, community dynamics, race relations, and more are all incredibly well handled and never seem to preach or teach. Instead it feels more like a glimpse into a community with all its ups and downs, the relationships people have with each other as they revolve around the characters of Nikolai and Miguel. Nikolai is a very intelligent, capable man that makes some surprising choices. I found myself on the same journey as Miguel, since I can\u2019t say I believe in magic, so I really loved watching Nikolai explain \u2013 in his totally confusing, circular way of talking \u2013 why he believes so deeply. All the while Miguel is trying to figure out if Nikolai should be locked up or treated like a treasure. I will say some of these conversations felt repetitive a little long winded, but thankfully there are only a few like that. Unfortunately for all the wonderful things going on in this story, it\u2019s a little weak on the romance aspect. In fact the slow friendship forming between Miguel and Nikolai for the space of the story never feels romantic for the most part until the very end. By this, the last 30 pages of the book get slightly romantic with one brief sex scene. It\u2019s also not a very explicit scene with some minor frottage so those who go into this wanting an erotic romance may be disappointed. I personally didn\u2019t mind and found the story fascinating on a lot of levels, although I would have liked the romance to be clearer earlier. There are also a few minor threads not entirely closed. This is not a paranormal story but a contemporary that talks about magic in the world. It has an incredibly vivid, gritty urban NY setting that leaps off the page. Combined with the wonderful characters, truly intriguing and interesting story, and solid writing delivers a book that stands out as totally unique and really refreshing. It has a lot of complexity that even this long winded review can\u2019t do justice to but it\u2019s not hard to read and actually pages fly by very quickly. The relationship between Nikolai and Miguel and the characters themselves are easily some of the most interesting I\u2019ve read in the genre and would recommend that based on that alone. But it\u2019s still a great story I think readers will like. Considering the publisher, I think most people will assume more erotic romance content than actually there so if you know going into the story it\u2019s a very small part, hopefully no one will be surprised and disappointed."}, {"userName": "Kaje Harper", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5309738-kaje-harper", "userReview": "An interesting pair of MCs come together here. Miguel is a New York City cop, trying to come back from having shot a man who was armed only with a realistic toy gun. He is being hounded by the media, and is dealing with his own guilt for both that incident, and past experiences in the military. Nikolai Adelman is a local shaman, de facto guardian of the poor community in which he lives, whose Jewish and anthropology backgrounds flavor his speech and outlook. The men meet over the case of several missing children in the community. They antagonize each other at first, but gradually come to see that each has strengths that the other lacks. The urban fantasy aspect of the story gradually builds, as Miguel moves further toward a forced belief in things unseen. Solving the case of the missing children will turn out to require both of them working together.I really liked Miguel, and the flavor of his relationship with Nikolai. I had a bit of a harder time getting a handle on Nikolai, as my perception of his age, abilities and personality seemed unstable. It felt almost like he'd taken on a persona that was a camouflage, larger than life, but it remained with him through to the end. The mystery solution was interesting, and not pat, although perhaps a bit abrupt and unsatisfying in the end. I really like Miguel's interactions with his police partner, Rob, learning to see beneath his bulldozer approach to truth and justice. No BDSM in this book, and little sex - it's a slow-building paranormal romance wrapped in a police procedural plot more than a mystery."}, {"userName": "Mandapanda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3673972-mandapanda", "userReview": "Really interesting characters.

Nikolai - the urban shaman - is a complex character with mannerisms that attract but also leave you wishing that you could smack some common sense into him. He is mystical, annoying, confusing, meddling, empathic, courageous, vulnerable, and has conversations that seemingly go off on straying tangents but ultimately reveal the truth. He becomes involved in a missing children's investigation and meets Miguel, one of the detectives handling the case. Miguel is also a complex character. He initially appears as somewhat distant with little emotional invovement in the people around him. As the investigation develops, he is revealed to be a deeply wounded (physically and emotionally) man who has been betrayed in the past by those who should have been supporting him. His interaction with Nikolai starts in confusion and ends in total truth - the journey healing in many ways for both the main characters and for those around them.This really is not an erotic romance but it is almost a mystical romance - for the characters anyway! There is very little sexual tension and indeed, there is only one mild sex scene. It is a crime investigation novel that is partnered with a magical/mystical/paranormal investigation and has romance added almost as an afterthought. At times it moved a little slowly when the emphasis was on Nikolai's nearly indecipherable explanations of shamanism, but the world building and depth of character balanced it for me. Overall I liked this novel but don't read it expecting to read an erotic romance!"}, {"userName": "Trix", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4450624-trix", "userReview": "[I mean some mystic ladies killing children just to keep them out of the hands of a pedophile?

From the \"urban\" point of view, it is gritty and raw-edged, with a believable sense of place. Plot-wise, it is a police procedural, with a rather heartbreaking crime at the core. The \"shaman\" aspect wove the mystical elements into the story in a way that made them integral to the story and not jarring. These elements were introduced gradually and only very gradually accepted by the protagonist, a cop with some very hard edges. The Shaman himself was a compelling character. A Jew turned native mystic with a penchant for expressing himself in Yiddish aphorisms and being terrifyingly trusting in bad circumstances, he is funny, engaging, secretive and likely to drive the protagonist insane all at once. A most unique character. The cop himself has a dark history that slowly unwinds. The relationship unfolds slowly, developing toward, not from, sex, which works both contextually and for the development of the characters.I took away a star because I felt the ending of the book was a bit abrupt and left a lot of strings hanging, even after the central mystery was more or less solved. The slow-growing relationship between the cop and the Shaman was a long way from any closure, as were elements of the stories of both characters and also the relationship between the cop and his hard-nosed, straight, by-the-book partner. Honestly, I would not be at all surprised to see a sequel, or even a series of them, so the loose threads may very well have been intentional, although I felt this particular story could have been brought to a close more neatly. If it proves to be the case that there are sequel(s), I would definitely follow the story to see where those loose threads lead."}, {"userName": "Emmie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4921869-emmie", "userReview": "I wanted to like this book more than I did. And frankly it's all Nikolai's fault. He came off as a caricature and he always felt vaguely false to me. Even the ending, felt unreal. As though he would never have allowed himself to be with Miguel. The yiddish phrases were also taken a bit to far. It felt like at least one a page he had to roll out with one. Also- It seemed odd for him to cling to Jewish culture after having consumed himself with mysticism and mythological folk hero magic. I mean, his story would have felt more real with references to Baba Yaga than with the Oys. He did say he was studying in Russia right? The mythology referenced seemed more like African or Aboriginal (as in the taking of energies from spirits or humans/ in his case an animal during his transition to Shaman) rather than Jewish mysticism. I could easily be wrong on that, but I guess it just didn't feel convincingly portrayed by the author and so it felt forced.

Not only that, but the captain\u2019s friend, a local shaman, is involved. Nikolai Adelman is the only lead anyone has concerning the missing kids, but he\u2019s not talking. At least, not in a language that Rassin or Jackson can understand. In order to solve this case, and with Jackson guarding his back, Rassin allows himself to get sucked into Adelman\u2019s mysticism, and his better understanding of the shaman changes their lives forever.This is technically a Mystery, but rather than being a good old fashioned who-done-it, it\u2019s more of the X-Files sort of mystery. The plot isn\u2019t convoluted, but the spiritual odyssey and transformation of the characters are fascinating. My favorite parts concerned the character development. Rassin really grows as a person, and each character was so unique and interesting and believable. They felt real to me. Their joy was my joy. Their pain was my pain.I\u2019ve mentioned that this was a Gay Urban Paranormal. I didn\u2019t say anything about romance, and I didn\u2019t mention it was explicit. But it is both romantic and slightly explicit, so if you\u2019re into that, no worries. But if you\u2019re not into explicit romances, then I think you\u2019d still enjoy this book. The plot would have remained unchanged if there wasn\u2019t any romantic chemistry between Rassin and Adelman, and the explicit scene isn\u2019t overpowering in any way. I classified it as gay, because while gayness isn\u2019t a super huge part of the novel, there are a few contemporary gay issues explored. Rassin is closeted, but he\u2019s not fooling anyone, and he works on shedding some of his hangups and issues over this throughout the novel.Check it out, and check out some of Gala\u2019s other works too.

When the call comes in about missing child things go from bad to worse, especially when it turns out there isn\u2019t just one missing child but seven. With a partner more likely to push him under the bus than save him from it and a man claiming to be a Shaman pushing all of his buttons, things look like they\u2019re going to get a lot worse for Miguel before they get better.While I\u2019ve loved everything else I\u2019ve read by this author so far, this one is apparently the exception to the rule. The book, from the working of the case to the urban fantasy elements, wasn\u2019t what I was expecting at all and while that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing, it didn\u2019t grab me in any meaningful way either. I found the shamanistic elements unique and interesting but all the Yiddish dialogue, while certainly something I\u2019ve not seen before, was kind of distracting after a while and detracted from the story. (At least for me.) I liked all of the ethnicities featured in the book, quite a bit actually, and I found the various characters to be quite engaging but the case itself seemed to suffer due to the focus on Nikolai and his role as a Shaman. I was really interested in the connection between him and Miguel, especially in his role as a Guardian, but it was disappointing that I never got to see that explored more. The ending of the book also felt a bit incomplete to me; the entire thing was pretty bittersweet and while there is a resolution of sorts, I didn\u2019t finish the book feeling satisfied with what I\u2019d just read. I find myself sorely in need of an epilogue and without it I just feel like something is missing. The writing was great and I loved the creativity that went into the characters and their backgrounds but the draw of the book for me was the case and it just wasn\u2019t represented as well as I would\u2019ve liked. I\u2019ll probably read this one again at some point in the future but I won\u2019t be in any hurry to.http://lovebytesreviews.com/2016/10/1..."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Mar 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3999189-alison", "userReview": "Length: 90,880 wordsPOV: \tThird LimitedKisses:\t5+ Kisses\u2014Loved it. You loved the book and would highly recommend it.\u201cUrban Shaman\u201d is written completely from Miguel\u2019s POV. Miguel has a strong sense of what is right and wrong, and a lack of tact, which often doesn\u2019t endear him to others. After what happened during his last posting in the army, and shooting the civillian, he\u2019s close to burning out. And then a kid goes missing.I fell in love with Miguel very quickly. A wounded warrior in all senses of the term, he\u2019s trying so hard to make a difference, regardless of the fact that the press and public hate him. He agrees to work with Rob, even though the man is more like a \u201csledgehammer\u201d (yes, I\u2019m quoting) and almost always puts witnesses offside, because it seems like the only way he\u2019ll be able to work on the case without press interference. And while they both suspect Nikolai\u2019s a con artist, Miguel is willing to accept the possibility that Nikolai actually cares for the small community he\u2019s adopted.Ms Gala writes wonderfully complex characters, and the crime investigation is both realistic and riveting. Rob Jackson more than just a side character, he adds to the story, and Nikolai is a wonderfully complicated man whose diverse parts add up to an intriguing whole.When I finished \u201cUrban Shaman\u201d, all I could think was \u201cWOW!\u201d I was so stunned I actually sat still for a moment to take stock. I\u2019d give this book more than five kisses if I could, although there is a slight possibility I am biased, since I have read and loved \u201cClaimings, Tails, and Other Alien Artifacts\u201d, \u201cAssimilation, Love, and Other Human Oddities\u201d, \u201cTurrbulence\u201d, \u201cDrift\u201d, and \u201cLong, Lonely Howl\u201d. I must admit, though, that I found The Monsters Below (from the \u201cMaking Contact\u201d anthology), and \u201cDesert World: Allegiences\u201d a bit too depressing (The Monsters Below was well-written and more in the vein of classic sci-fi), so maybe not.I believe any lover of crime or suspense will enjoy this story greatly, regardless of whether they enjoy paranormal or urban fantasy or not. As with most of Ms Gala\u2019s books, this is a story of personal discovery with a gripping plot. Another great story. Thank you, Ms Gala, and please, please keep on writing."}, {"userName": "Julesmarie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6948666-julesmarie", "userReview": "This was just absolutely fascinating. I loved Nikolai and his way of seeing the world. And I loved Miguel and how he evolved as the story went on. I even completely loved Rob, and how much his honesty and uncompromising rationality helped balance and clarify Nikolai's influence on Miguel.I also was fascinated by what this had to say about community, and how we relate with those around us.It was a little too difficult to read (especially the first part, I nearly stopped reading after Miguel first goes to the building, because it was just too real, too gritty, and too depressing) for me to call it entertaining, but it was definitely fascinating. And I'm so glad I finished it. This is one I'll be thinking about for a while to come.\nSome Favorite Quotes:\nHe was actually pretty talented at being wrong.he was an odd collection of unfashionable decades.he couldn't fit himself back into his life in Iowa.For the first time, he could believe the kid had a PhD, because he seemed to have an entire encyclopedia shoved in his brain and it was falling out at once and six years of military training had not prepared him for this kind of attack.\"I was put outside my first community, and I have never fully found a way back in.

I like it when characters don't always fall into bed. Instead, there is something that rings true for me when it takes time for emotions to build and the characters to admit their attraction to themselves and to each other. Love at first sight is fun but ultimately it has been my experience that things don't usually happen like that. Thus, I found this story appealing, because of the character interactions.However, it wasn't just the two main characters that got me. I also really liked Detective Rob Jackson. He was blunt but one of the nice things about blunt straight forward people is that you know where you stand with him. The way he viewed things and the way he interacted with Miguel was a great thread to this book.Overall, 'Urban Shaman' is not just about the main characters but about community. I'm glad that the author included this aspect as it's curtail to the idea of Shamanism in traditional societies. I found it fascinating to read an urban depiction of a more traditional role and the directions that the author chooses to take it. I labeled this book as a romance but in many ways it's as much about finding community and a role within a larger familial grouping as it is about romance. That being said, if you're looking for a book with lots of hot and heavy sex this isn't it. 'Urban Shaman', is a wonderful mix of characterization, story line, building tensions and yes eventual resolutions. :)"}, {"userName": "Drianne", "userReviewDate": "Jul 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4737208-drianne", "userReview": "Hmm. I'm kind of undecided here. There were things I liked a lot, but given that part of this character study (which is really the main plot type) of the MC, an NYPD detective, is about how he shouldn't have to feel guilty about having shot an African-American man who really just wanted to commit suicide-by-cop and was waving around a toy gun and it's not the MC's fault at all... well, I don't think I was ever going to warm up to that. Also, the other character is a \"shaman\" (cultural appropriation ahoy!) who's Jewish. You know he's Jewish because he peppers every other sentence with Yiddish. Dude, he's under 30, not over 70. Also, everyone in the US, including our MC I'm sure, knows the word verklempt thanks to SNL, even if the book has spelled it oddly. Also also, Conservative Judaism is not the same as Orthodox Judaism.The weirdest thing? I couldn't help feeling that somewhere under this book lurks a Sentinel AU. Not the normal kind where random people are Sentinels who have Guides blah blah blah, but an actual AU of the show where Blair is the urban shaman of the title and Jim is Latino and went to Iraq instead of the jungles of Peru. It was kind of distracting. But don't worry, this is pretty!Blair like in the show in everyone's head, not actual!Blair.

He's got a spotty record from the Army, a one-night stand who won't go away, and a flock of reporters trying to crucify him for shooting a civilian waving a toy pistol. Now kids are turning up missing in the Bronx, and he's partnered with by-the-book Detective Rob Jackson, a man with problems of his own. Their first suspect is a local shaman, Nikolai Adelman, who is either the strangest holy man ever or a con working his own angle. Miguel's trying to navigate a baffling case that has more questions than answers, caught between a surprising physical desire for Nikolai and his new partner's suspicions about a shaman who claims supernatural forces are at work. Miguel has always tried to avoid relationships out of guilt and fear, but Nikolai sees the darkness in Miguel's heart--and the fortitude Miguel has hidden deep inside, a strength that will help him solve the case and reclaim his life.", "title": "Urban Shaman", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7859755-urban-shaman", "average": 3.77, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1285251960l/7859755.jpg", "reviews": 52, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3092531.Lyn_Gala", "name": "Lyn Gala"}], "type": ["Romance", "Fantasy", "Mystery", "Fantasy", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7859755-urban-shaman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7938198-urban-shaman", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38617807-claimings-tails-and-other-alien-artifacts", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17279577-fettered", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23110213-assimilation-love-and-other-human-oddities", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18694013-turbulence", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27401647-affiliations-aliens-and-other-profitable-pursuits"]}
