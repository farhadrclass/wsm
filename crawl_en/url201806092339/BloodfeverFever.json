It's still fun to read, even knowing who is what and does what why. It actually shows how well planned this whole series had been.First I want to thank Kat for recommending this series to me. So far it's been exceeding my expectations and I hope it will continue doing so. In this installment MacKayla Lane continues her search for Sinsar Dubh, a powerful Unseelie artifact containing the deadliest Fae magic. She is recovering from the ordeal she experienced at the end of the previous book and at the same time has to face the aftermath of her actions - Inspector O'Daffy is getting very interested in finding out more about the Dark Zone and why Mac is not going back home; Malluce's death is still uncertain; Rocky O'Bannion's brother, Derek, surfaces to poke around in Mac's business; and finally, a mysterious specter keeps following MacKayla around giving her creeps...In my opinion, Bloodfever is even better than Darkfever. The Fae world is getting wider, Moning gets us deeper into the lore which is very exciting. We get to know Mac much better and I like her quite a bit. I like her humor and her upbeat personality, I enjoy seeing her grow and change and learn about her abilities. Death-by-sex Fae Prince V'lane is even more mysterious and his intentions toward Mac are unclear. Same applies to Barrons, who is a total enigma. The Mac/Jericho chemistry is off the charts! I simply LOVE these two. Jericho is slowly but surely climbing up the list of my favorite fictional hunks, but he'd better stop roughing up Mac if he ever wants to get to the top of it, because I don't care for this kind of thing. All in all, a great book. It doesn't have much of a resolution in terms of the main story arc (which is not a problem for me), but the minor story arc is as interesting, intense, dark and edgy. I am planning to get my hands on Faefever very soon."}, {"userName": "Natasha Polis", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19208239-natasha-polis", "userReview": "4.5!!Done!

Immediately, she begins to act like her parents just dropped off the face of the earth, and she starts referring to her sister as her only real family. Her attitude instantly turned ungrateful. Yes, she was just being a drama queen, but I know for a fact that you can love someone who isn't related to you just as much as someone who is. The fact that she is not technically related to them doesn't mean that they are no longer her family. That's really my only gripe about Mac in this book. I still think she kicks ass, just give your parents some credit! She actually had the guts to say \"He was lucky I was even calling him Dad at all!\" Really? At least she recanted it fairly quickly when he shows up all worried about her. After that, she seems mostly back to normal with them again.I'm starting to feel bad for Mac, though. I mean she's been mystically undressed and nearly performing involuntary sex acts in public (who hasn't?), rape-kissed by a drunken Irish man (uh, ditto), hit on by two seemingly normal history nerds (I persist, who hasn't?) and she's also teased inexorably, and now kissed and dry-humped, by the hot man she spends 90% of her time with (who wouldn't want to be?) yet she STILL isn't getting any.I'll warn you now that when i start to think about Jericho, my mind goes into a mixed state of paranoia and reckless abandon. It's no secret how I feel about Barron's name. But the way I feel in general about Jericho Zigor Barrons, or as I like to call him, J-Ziggy, is best summed up with this redonkulously articulate rant: love love loooooove adore gaaaaawd hellaluyah ahgagwhjrhfjfjkd mothreffenyes ahhhhhhhh!! !#%@?!/%#+!)$:\u00a0*confetti popping out of head*Barrons is standoff-ish, confident and snarky, yet endlessly intriguing. He is the kind of guy who can make you feel everything and nothing at the same damn time. Not to mention, he likes to chain up women while they are wearing skimpy bikinis. Cough*jabbathehutt*Cough. Except, I probably wouldn't mind being chained up by him. Barrons, I mean, not Jabba. Obviously.Oh shiz! Why does Barrons have chains readily available in his basement???? For chaining up people as he feeds on them? For chaining up the Seelie? What-the-fa??? Fuuuuuudgin Fudge! He's Unseelie, isn't he?!?! It's a rhetorical question! Dang it! I don't want to know, wait, yeah I do. No. No, I don't.Yeah, I'm going crazy and I tried to warn you. Uh. Now I'm freaked out. Anyway, sooooo, I was thinking about who could pull off playing him in a movie. It would have to be someone very good with the eyes. Jeric-- er, Barrons uses a lot of non-verbal communication, which I find very sexy. So it would have to be someone like Ian Somerhalder AKA 'Smolder'holder. He is really very good with the \"looks\" but I'm not sure he could pull off the really long hair that Barrons has. And he's awfully pale, so not necessarily him. Ideas, anyone? Ah who cares, I just wanted to think about him. *sigh*I also have to give a big \"hell yeah\" to Mac for not caving to the demands of any of the several groups of people vying for her servitude. She refuses to take the easy way out and be ordered around blindly for each one's \"higher\" purpose. Not even with Barrons. Proudly and unbiasedly, she chooses her own higher purpose, and I have to applaud her for that. Like she herself says, she is no one's puppet, which cannot be said for many heroes or heroines in fantasy novels. Normally, someone discovers them, tells them about their abilities, teaches them to harness their powers, and then tells them exactly what to do with them. She does her best to not let that happen and chooses what she thinks is best, not what the others tell her is.The author's knack for introducing small amounts of information at a time, interspersed amongst the action, leads to a captivating experience. Too much information is never given up. We the readers, like Mac, have to earn the privilege of learning more about this strange world. There are no info-dumps in this series. And I appreciate it.In short, I loved it. And Eeeep! There's the next one sitting on my shelf!! This one ends on a bit of a cliffhanger, so I think I have to go now... Can't wait to get back to Barrons. *sigh*My review for the first book, Darkfever. Spoiler FREE.For the third book, Faefever. Spoiler FREE.The fourth book, Dreamfever.

Before Fever Series\u2026.absolutely NO\u2026.and now here I am \u2026.unable to stop reading a genre I have not had much interest\u2026.apart from the Lord of the Rings books (which blew me away!!!). I immediately started reading Bloodfever, the 2nd book of Karen Marie Moning\u2019s Fever Series after turning the last page of the 1st book, Darkfever,which I reviewed, http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11... I am back into the dark world of the Fae,\u2026.. MacKayla Lane has discovered and accepted and come to terms of the gift of being a sidhe seer, with special powers, one of these being the ability to sense the Sinsar Dubh, an ancient book of the blackest magic even seen, which holds the key to the balance of power between the Fae and humans. It\u2019s the only thing that will save humanity from being destroyed by the Fae.I am so totally crazy about Mac. I love her view of her world\u2026she\u2019s lost a bit of that \u201cI\u2019m so into pink\u201d\u2026not totally at this point. She realizes that she will do anything to survive..she will bend the any rules, make alliances with anyone who can help her find her sister\u2019s killer, fulfill Alina\u2019s last request before she died and the answer to what her role is in this power struggle between humans and fae? You can still feel her vulnerability, her insecurities but as she discovers more about herself, the stronger and more determined she becomes. When she says \u201cWhat had changed was me\u201d at the end, I realized how far she has come and how much more she will have to go through before finding all the answers. I loved Mac\u2019s optimism\u2026even when things look dark and scary she still tries to see a bit of \u201csun, pink\u201d ahead of her. She has such an amazing way of analyzing things that are happening in her life\u2026and wow\u2026.it\u2019s like going on a rollercoaster ride. Non-stop action!!!!!!!!!She is still living at Barron\u2019s Books & Baubles..I love this bookstore\u2026I could live there forever, surrounded by books and nothing else\u2026no wait\u2026I would want Jericho Barrons with me there with me!!!!!!! Jericho Z Barrons \u2013 I AM SO TOTALLY INTO HIM!!!!! He\u2019s one of the most exciting heroes\u2019 in a book, EVER\u2026amazing, mysterious, secretive, gorgeous, sexy, stylish, rich, classy\u2026.I could go on and on\u2026but u get the idea \u2026\u2026he\u2019s beyond HOT\u2026he\u2019s the kind of man any woman would be dazzled, fascinated and\u2026enthralled by!!!!!!!! This is not a romance series, has no or very few sex scenes but you can certainly feel the chemistry, the heat, the sizzle between him and Mac..of course both try to fight it and I can\u2019t wait to see what happens between the two. Jericho is very protective over Mac but does he have an ulterior motive? What is he? A seelie, unseelie, druid, fae\u2026how old is this guy\u2026is he immortal \u2026\u2026she can feel something in him that is not totally human. Can she trust him? What does he want from her?And then, there\u2019s V\u2019lane\u2026.I keep thinking\u2026lane, lane\u2026is there any connection or meaning to Mac\u2019s family name Lane???? The Seelie Prince who also wants something from her\u2026but is he really who he says he is???? What does he want from Mac? She knows he is not telling her everything but she decides to forge an alliance with him as well\u2026which drives Jericho crazy of course!!!!! In the growing darkness, V\u2019lane is the one who takes her to the Faery world \u2026..where she spends time in the sun\u2026..loved the scene on the beach in Cancun\u2026really funny\u2026.and when Mac spends time with her sister\u2026that was so poignant.Mac discovers she is not the only sidhe seer and tries to link up with them but their Mistress, Rowena, who Mac first met in Darkfever, is not prepared to have her join the group unless she agrees to obey her..which of course Mac is so just not going to do!!!!!!!! What give up her spear??? Rowena is such a wicked character\u2026I so hate her and hope she comes to a really gruesome ending!!!!!!!! Her characters are so vivid, so real, so believable. Fast story pacing made me at times so breathless like I had was running a marathon!!!!! Dani, the teenage sidhe seer with her sword and \u201cspeed\u201d, Malluce\u2026we discover what happens to this vampire\u2026and what evil he does to Mac\u2026shiver\u2026\u2026the Lord Master, who Mac still believes killer her sister (imo\u2026he didn\u2019t) but he\u2019s definitely dark\u2026.and evil\u2026I mean bringing the evil and ugly unseelie into the human world\u2026. Christian\u2026loved how the author brings in a bit from her Highlander Series\u2026.The more we learn about Mac\u2019s world, the more questions come up. You think you know something\u2026and then\u2026wam\u2026so totally different to what you thought!!!!!!!This is such a compelling series\u2026I just can\u2019t get enough. Non-stop reading\u2026\u2026Can\u2019t wait to start book 3 next. Karen Marie Moning is an incredible writer and I can\u2019t get enough of her stories.I liked the Glossary at the back of the book\u2026explains Mac\u2019s World and also you get to know how to pronounce all those Celtic words!!!!!!!"}, {"userName": "Mo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11856352-mo", "userReview": "4.5 stars.This one starts off where Darkfever finished.

Barrons himself said when he thought she was all useless fluff and nails, she showed some teeth. And Barrons is, in my opinion, one of the best male characters ever written in the genre.. He's enigmatic, he's complex, he's nothing you've ever seen and at the same time he's simple. He's exactly what he shows you. And sometimes, he let himself go and say things like this:\n\"This wasn't what I wanted,\" Barrons was saying. \"This isn't what I would have chosen. You must know that. It's important that you know that.\" \nThere's this moment when I think they've found themselves in common ground. They both have been broken and survived it. I think this is the moment when he sees her. And starts losing the war against himself.\n\"Did you break once?\"\"Yes,\" he said finally. \"Did you kill the bastard?\"\"With my bare hands. After I kill his wife.\" He waved his hand at the door of the cell. \"You lead, Ms. Lane. I've got your back.\"\n* CAVE SCENE. CAVE SCENE *Cave Scene.cave scene.cave scene.cave scene.Finally, I love how Mac just does what it takes in order to survive. She said it herself. There's no black and white. \n\"There are only shades of gray. Black and white are nothing more than lofty ideals in our minds, the standards by which we try to judge things, and map out our place in the world in relevance to them.\"\nSo, she'll eat whatever she has to, she'll hang up with whoever she has to and she will accept whatever the night brings because she's changed too.__________________________First read: October 20134 *freaking solid* stars\nIt's our action that defines us. What we choose. What we resist. What we're willing to die for.\nI think I could describe Bloodfever as intense, fearless, brilliant, addictive, unputdownable and even then you wouldn't know how awesome this book is. The writing is addictive. Karen Marie Moning is a genius. The plot is there, I know it is, there must be... but here's the crazy thing: I have no fucking idea what the hell is going on and I don't feel betrayed at all, actually I'm so into this. I mean, she managed to capture my attention from chapter one and I just couldn't stop reading it. The best part? I'm satisfied. No complains about the lack of answers at all. The characters are incredibly complex and their development is amazing. Mac, once spoiled and annoying, is a total badass, funny, witty, flawed, resolved and so realistic I had to check twice if this was indeed UF material. Barrons is everything I want you'd ever wanted in a man if you liked incredibly strong, frustratingly enigmatic, impossible and dominating men. God, I do have issues... And this:\n\"Yes, I have loved, Ms. Lane, and although it\u2018s none of your business, I have lost. Many things. And no, I am not like any other player in this game and I will never be like V\u2018lane, and I get a hard-on a great deal more often than occasionally.\" He leaned fully against me and I gasped. \"Sometimes it\u2018s over a spoiled little girl, not a woman at all.\u201d \nYes, the emotional and intense Jericho moment when you just know there's no hope for you. I'm fascinated by Fever. \n\u201cThe wisest man is the silent one. Examine his actions. Judge him by them.\u201d \nOh, I'm judging you, Barrons... and I have some crazy theories about what you are, you sexy bastard."}, {"userName": "Georgia \u2665 Team Dex \u2665", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9138738-georgia-team-dex", "userReview": "4 What-the-BLOODY-Hell Stars\"It\u2019s our actions that define us.

Bring on the Barrons!!New thoughts after reread: I was actually thinking that Mac was growing a bit in this story, and I was really proud of her for standing up to the Mob-guy... until she utters this ridiculousness:\n\"Go ahead, O'Bannion, come and get it. I'm fed up with jack-petunias like you.\"\nOriginal review from 2014:So, in Georgia they call the hot lava game \"don't touch the alligator\"? That's just weird! Everyone knows that when you are kids, you pretend the floor is covered in HOT LAVA, and that is why you jump from beds to dressers to couches to tables, etc... There was even an epic episode of Community where Abed and Troy start a giant hot lava game at the school for Troy's last day. It was dean-tastic!But, it figures that Mac would have a stupid name for the game. She can't even swear like a normal person. Idiot!The action in this book does get better than the last and the dark characters are really interesting. I like the complexity of the story, and how it keeps growing as time goes on. Nothing ends too quickly or neatly, which is nice. And, Mac has gotten a tiny bit smarter, more so in the beginning of the book, but she has a long way to go to get to your average person's start point.It seems pretty obvious, though, that Mac is still making way too many stupid assumptions. And, her stubbornness combined with her stupidly false bravado is going to keep getting her almost killed and waiting for Jericho to save her every book."}, {"userName": "Princess under cover", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9604542-princess-under-cover", "userReview": "I am speechless. Where do I begin?It was sort of good, I was even heading toward 4 stars when I started the book, giving me interesting, emotionally connective banter (see my notes) that I was starting to feel glad I continued with Book 2. But right now, unless my reading buddy group dragged me or persuaded me with arguments too powerful to resist, I am NOT getting Book 3 or any other book in the series. Where to begin with the disappointment? I will preface by saying that maybe my expectations about the book/ series is just wrong. And if so, I feel kind of bad about giving a low rating because of my own misaligned expectations. Nevertheless, I paid for the books and read them. So the low rating stands.My review of Book 1 is still how I feel about Book 2. With the following adds:* Events that happen in this series seem to be planned so that the reader can slowly discover the various powers of the various characters, and the ultimate mystery that keeps people going - who is Jericho Barrons? What does he want with the book? What do the other characters want with the book? (but the other characters are secondary.) The most compelling character in this series for me is not the heroine, I honestly couldn't care less for her. The only compelling character is JB. And if I'm in a better mood I might pick up Book 3 just to see where JB is headed. OR, I might just read other people's reviews and save myself the $ and time.* Given above, events in this series don't seem to follow much plot or evolution. They're just devices to pepper in more mystery and pseudo discovery - Oh, Malluce isn't really who we thought. He's just weirder and scarier. And the twenty odd pages of torture was for... what purpose exactly?* There's no real emotional connection between the characters. I said this already for Book 1 and I was hoping things would change in Book 2 and was almost optimistic they would, and then we're back to flatness. There's a pseudo sex scene that is extremely weird and displaced given the situation and did nothing to further the relationship between the two main characters. I am left deeply unsatisfied after reading it.I don't get it. Is this a paranormal thriller? paranormal horror book? certainly not a paranormal romance, nor really all that fantasy like. But maybe I haven't read enough fantasy books to judge.

The second installment, Bloodfever flawlessly retains the addictive nature of the story. The plot is getting edgier, more dramatic and intense. With every page we get immersed deeper into the powerful and deadly world of Fae. I used to think Darkfever was fast paced, but in comparison, Bloodfever is a total rush. Oh, don't get me wrong, in no way is this hurried, but the sheer number of events that take place in such a narrow timeframe is absolutely appalling. Even though we are supplied with plenty of new information, much is left unanswered leaving the reader delirious with anticipation. Action-packed and jammed with suspense, this second book in the Fever series is an insane, wild ride that filled me with doubts and left me craving for more.\u201cIt's a strange new world out there and the rules have changed: It's every princess for herself.\u201d Alongside the plot, the character development is progressing just right. Mac has come a long way in a short time. Accepting her gift as a sidhe-seer, she has grown into a stronger, more mature and determined young woman who can stand her ground. She is learning the ways of this world, getting smarter and coming out of her pink and pastel cocoon. Barrons, on the other hand remains an enigma. Dark and secretive, he still manages to be exasperatingly irresistible. Won't we all love to get more insight on this brooding, dangerous, antagonizing character of all times. Here's hoping in the next book maybe. At least we had a few intense, emotional scenes with Barrons and Mac. Talk about slow burn romance! \"One day you will kiss a man you can\u2019t breathe without, and find breath is of little consequence.\"The Fae Prince, V'lane and his intentions are still a complete mystery to me. Manipulation is in his nature, he does not play fair and is extremely sly. I didn't like him anymore than I did in Darkfever. Let's see what the future holds for him. As for secondary characters, Bloodfever has a fair share of some great ones. I particularly liked Dani. She has sass and exactly the right attitude towards life. I'd like to get to know her better. Same with Ryodan. Rowena, on the other hand seems like a ruthless and cunning person with her own agenda. I wonder what that is! Questions, questions!! And as if we didn't have enough questions, the ending too is a cliffhanger!Karen Marie Moning has done a brilliant job of weaving an intricate, enticing story that is getting better and more convoluted with every installment. On to Faefever now, in hopes of getting some of those answers and uncovering a few mysteries. \"Hope is a critical thing. Without it, we are nothing. Hope shapes the will.

I think I might confuse some of both books together if I try to summarize it for anyone. Suffice it to say that I\u2019m hooked! In Darkfever, Mac was a spoiled, na\u00efve, and innocent young woman out to find her sister, Alina\u2019s murderer. In Bloodfever, Mac has grown up a bit, whether she wanted to or not. She\u2019s still the old-fashioned southern, pink, and sparkle clad woman when she can be, but she\u2019s no longer as innocent as she was. \nMac: \u201cI would wear pink because I knew my future was anything but rosy. I would accessorize myself to the hilt, and I would wear flirty shoes because my world needed more beauty to counter all the ugliness in it. I would wear pink because I hated gray, I didn\u2019t deserve white, and I was sick of black.\u201d\nBloodfever follows Mac in her quest to find the Unseelie book, the Sinsar Dubh, her dying sister\u2019s last wish, with Barrons. She still has no idea what Barrons motives are in finding the ancient and powerful book, but at the moment he\u2019s been the most helpful of all the big players, saving her life a couple of times. She still keeps V\u2019lane in her back pocket, but at arms length because he\u2019s a death-by-sex Fae prince (not a horrible way to go, IMO, but still), and she\u2019s not about to trust him fully. I, like Mac wouldn\u2019t trust Rowena any farther than I could throw that old witch! She\u2019s left her high and dry too many times for my liking! I like the direction Mac and Barron\u2019s relationship is taking, and whether they admit it to each other or themselves, you can tell they\u2019re beginning to matter to one another. Love this quote because it\u2019s so no-nonsense and oh-so-Barrons:\n \u201cWhat are you Barrons?\u201d\u201cThe one who will never let you die, and that\u2019s more, Ms. Lane, than anyone in your life has been able to say to you. More than anyone else can do.\u201d \nThis is like a love letter from Barrons. He may not utter words of endearment to Mac, but you can tell she\u2019s burrowed a way into his heart. I just know it. Mac goes through a lot in this installment. Thankfully it\u2019s not detailed bit by bit, because I can\u2019t take that sort of thing. At the end of Bloodfever there\u2019s a lot of unanswered questions but I was able to pop in the next book, Faefever, right after finishing, so I\u2019m not going to complain! I have to say, when I first started listening to this audio I wasn\u2019t pleased that it was a woman narrating every voice, even Barrons, but now that I\u2019ve been listening to it, I don\u2019t mind. I love the southern voice for Mac, it\u2019s pitch perfect. Faefever is the same narrator, Joyce Bean, and I love it already. I\u2019m curious how the last two are going to sound. There is a switch to a male and female narrator and I\u2019m excited! I\u2019ve heard only good things about the male narrator. Can\u2019t wait! I've been listening to the audio CD's to and from work. Finally, my commute time doesn't seem like such a waste.

This second installment was Much better than the first. It has lots of action and with all the mayhem it gets pretty hard to put down. The mystery, though, is still there picking away at my brain cells. We got no real answers in this one, especially from Barrons. Only more questions. Which ended up being ok because the book is fully loaded and it couldn't possibly all fit in here. Plus the anticipation is kind of fun.Mac is becoming more independent and grown up which is great. I think she kind of has to with this new world she's been thrown in. I like how she herself knows there are \"two\" Macs and she refers to them both. She acknowledges that her Barbie doll side does not mix well with the Unseelie and especially not Barrons. And talking about the devil\u2026 what can I say Barrons? I love you! You are probably the most antagonizing son of a bitch I have ever encountered. There are so many questions about this guy that it's almost a torture. Damn you Karen!There are also new characters added to the storyline - but who cares about them? Moving on..Like any other UF novel, there are a few twists, and most of them just add to the questions already in the air. I didn't see them coming either. Although who/what the spectre was did cross my mind, but even the small stuff all went over my head. It may just be because I was too busy inside the story to ponder anything. But I never figured out what was eating the Rhino-boys, or Malluc\u00e9's power source. Even though we aren't given answers to any of the big mysteries, we do find out little snippets. Just enough to keep us fed and craving for more.I did enjoy the plot quite a bit. I like lots of action, I like mystery and I love a well built world; believe me, this novel delivers. The world building was formed in the first book, but it's deepened and I enjoy the vivid descriptions of everything. It's all very nerve wracking. There is quite a bit of gore but there is also humor thrown in there to balance it out a bit. I especially liked when the Shade flipped Mac off. >.< So all in all the writing is pretty good, I would even say improved from book #1.
