First things first. I had a minor issue with INNKEEPER CHRONICLES #2. Obviously, I still enjoyed the book\u2014very much\u2014but the problem can't go unaddressed, and I feel like I've painted a more negative picture than I intended to. You have been duly disclaimed.I recently had an opportunity to read the opening chapters for an Andrews' work-in-progress. I was told in advance that it was darker than what they usually write, and I mistakenly equated \u201cdarker\u201d with violence. In hindsight, it was a na\u00efve thing to do\u2014the Andrews have never shied away from violence\u2014and now I think SWEEP IN PEACE is similarly darker.For years, myself and many others have been begging the Andrews to write something about the younger generation from their THE EDGE series: Jack, George, Gaston, and Lark/Sophie. They finally have, and I almost wish they hadn't. Now that the excitement of seeing them again has worn off, now that I'm rereading the installment in its entirety, I can see these adult versions of the children who stole my heart more clearly . . . and what I see . . . It\u2019s darrrrrrk.Jack and Gaston are mostly present for comic relief, but George . . . he's as intelligent as ever, but now he's also unscrupulous. Gone is the boy whose life was slowly draining away b/c he couldn't bear to let things die. Instead, he's a master manipulator. He treats those around him as pawns in his long game. The fact that he's obviously pained by the necessity of his actions only makes it worse.Lark . . . She's an adult version of the traumatized child who hung dead animals in her tree so she wouldn't starve when her family ostracized her for being the monster she still believes she is.And it HURTS.*backpedals* *does NOT want Julie and Derek spinoff* *dons sackcloth and rolls around in ashes*But as painful as parts\u2014it's NOT just one big kick in the teeth\u2014of SiP are, it's still pure Andrews' brilliance. At the end of CLEAN SWEEP, Sean left Earth to repay a favor and to experience the universe. Four months have passed, and the Gertrude Hunt is empty except for permanent guest Caldenia:\n\"Dina, I\u2019m bored,\u201d Caldenia announced.Too bad. I guaranteed her safety, not entertainment. \u201cWhat about your game?\u201dHer Grace gave me a shrug. \u201cI\u2019ve beaten it five times on the Deity setting. I\u2019ve reducedParis to ashes because Napoleon annoyed me. I\u2019ve eradicated Gandhi. I\u2019ve crushed George Washington. Empress Wu had potential, so I eliminated her before we even cleared Bronze Age. The Egyptians are my pawns. I dominate the planet. Oddly, I find myself mildly fascinated by Genghis Khan. A shrewd and savage warrior, possessing a certain magnetism. I left him with a single city, and I periodically make ridiculous demands that I know he can\u2019t meet so I can watch him squirm.\"\nOh, yeah. Caldenia is still creepily fantastic. And bored. Which strikes me as highly concerning.Luckily, before she can get into trouble, the inn alerts Dina that a guest has arrived.That guest is George. He is now an arbiter, and he has been given the task of mediating a peace conference between three warring factions. He would like the conference to take place at Gertrude Hunt.Hmm . . . On the one hand, such a large event would sustain the inn for months, maybe years. On the other hand, two of the warring parties:\n . . . hated each other so much their feud had become legendary. Half the jokes in the galaxy started with \u201ca vampire and an otrokar walk into a bar....\u201d\nWhich is hilarious, but not at all conducive to successful negotiations for peace.BUT (of course) Dina decides the benefits outweigh the potential for catastrophe, so she agrees to host the summit with only two days to prepare before the 36+ mortal enemies guests arrive.YES. That is a lot of mortal enemies guests. Especially considering Dina has no staff. With only Caldenia in residence, she doesn't need staff. She cooks the meals, and the inn takes care of everything else.But Dina\u2019s primary role as Innkeeper is to preserve neutrality, so someone else will need to do the cooking.Meet Orro:\nMy future chef was an oversized, hysterical hedgehog with a martyr complex.\nYES. I did make that myself. Those black things are hedgehog spines. Obviously. Geez.But as entertaining as Caldenia, Orro, Jack, Gaston, etc. are, they can't negate the aforementioned darkness. Everything that happens in SiP is an extension of the peace negotiations. Peace negotiations that are taking place b/c all three factions have lost so much, watched helplessly as loved ones have died, they are willing to meet, face-to-face, across the table from the source of their grief. These people are tired. Heartbreakingly so. They are filled with bitterness, and they are desperate for all of it to mean something. Like I said. Dark. SWEEP IN PEACE isn't a walk in the park. It's not a lone alien assassin with nasty lizard Rottweilers terrorizing neighborhood pets. You can't just kill the Bad Guy and get back to business as usual. War has permanent consequences, especially for the survivors---once you're dead, you're dead. But those left alive when the treaty is brokered . . . They have to find a way to move past the horror of what they've seen and what they've done. And as the reader, there's no escaping that knowledge. That being said, Caldenia and co. do dull the sharp edges. And sometimes characters have to survive a purifying fire to become who they're meant to be . . . It's the untried youths who are excited about the glory they'll win in war. It's the veterans who know war is anything but glorious.The INNKEEPER CHRONICLES by Ilona Andrews falls under the umbrella that I like to call MUST READ, and SWEEP IN PEACE is its most recent chapter. It is awesome, it is terrible, and you will cry. So arm yourself with some quality chocolate, and read it for yourself. Nothing worthwhile is completely painless, and if yer too chicken to walk this road with these beloved characters, you don't deserve to reap the benefits of what comes next. *drops mic and walks away*My other reviews for this series:\nClean Sweep (Innkeeper Chronicles, #1)\nPre-review:DUDE. So the thing about serials is that the recovery time between installments can inhibit the overall effect. You're too, \"YAASSS! George! Jack! LARK!\" to pay close attention to what these beloved characters are actually doing. For that reason alone, I recommend all you crazy Andrews stalkers (RE)read SWEEP IN PEACE in its entirety.BUT. Be forewarned . . . it HURTS. *whispers* So good."}, {"userName": "\u2718\u2718 Sarah \u2718\u2718 (former Nefarious Breeder of Murderous Crustaceans)", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298986-sarah-former-nefarious-breeder-of-murderous-crustaceans", "userReview": "[Maybe.

In fact, they absolutely stole the show and out-shined both of the main characters in the final book,  Steel's Edge. And for those of you who (like me) felt like the ending was missing something concerning Spider? Well, then the Prologue for Sweep in Peace is definitley for you.I'm really hoping that George & Co. are going to get their own series somewhere down the road, but for now, I'm just glad to see them again. Oh, one more thing!I loved the explanation for why Jack's shapshifting was magical and not alien. *squee*Ok. So as for the rest of the story? It was good. Maybe not as awesome as the first book, but still extremely readable. Oh, and I love the addition of Orro! He was probably my favorite new character in this one. I loved his pitiful drama queen act - which just so over the top that it fit the bill perfectly for the kind of comic relief that was needed.The gist is that Diana's Inn is playing host to peace talks between some of the most dangerous and volatile beings in the universe. And she's got to keep them from killing each other or her Inn's rating will go down. <--which means that no one will visit, and her Inn will shrivel up and go dormant!There's a very Agatha Christie mystery that needs to be solved, and at the end, Dina does her best impression of Hercule Poirot - what with the gathering the suspects and the announcing of the perpetrator in a big dramatic way. It was kinda cool.I'll admit, it might have been the lack of Sean in this that took the story down a notch for me. I get why he was absent for the majority of the story, but I'm just not sure I liked very much of that plotline. Eh. I'm still a bit up in the air about it...Overall, this was still very good, though. And if it suffers a teeny bit from second books syndrome? Well, it's still better than most of the stuff in this genre.

It's the only explanation that I can come up with to explain how it wasn't until 90% of the way through the book I had a lightbulb moment and realized that I knew 1/2 of the characters from before... from way before. I'm blaming the fact that it has been years since I've read an Edge book, but, honestly, there is no excuse. These characters were grown up, more damaged versions of the children that I remembered and loved. I wish that Ilona Andrews gave these guys more of a happy story, but I guess that's the way the cookie crumbles. I adored mostly everything about this story. I say it every time I read a IA book, but Ilona Andrews can do no wrong.

The story feels a little different when you are able to immerse yourself in the world over a much shorter timeframe and live in Gertrude Hunt for a few days. The emotions hit harder, the pain is more palpable and the story definitely flows better.Clean Sweep was just a good time going up against the bad guy and getting used to the world of an Innkeeper and the magical world that brings with it. Sweep in Peace is a little darker and much more of a political story as three different factions come to Gertrude Hunt for Peace Negotiations. Just in time too Caldenia was getting bored and I have a feeling that is dangerous.\n\u201d Caldenia blinked. \u201cWho are the attending parties?\u201d \u201cThe Holy Anocracy, represented by House Krahr; the Hope-Crushing Horde; and the Merchants of Baha-char. They are coming here for the arbitration, and they will probably try to murder each other the moment they walk through the door.\u201dCaldenia\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cDo you really think so? This is absolutely marvelous!\u201d\nWho is heading up these negotiations? None other than George Camarine from the Edge series who brings with him some of my other favorites Jack, Sophie and Gaston. So the question is do you need to read The Edge Series before this? Well no, it isn\u2019t necessary, the story will totally make sense even if you have never read The Edge Series. Although it is Ilona Andrews so why haven\u2019t you read it yet?  But for those of us who have read The Edge Series it is a special bonus to see all the kids from that series all grown up AND I LOVED IT!!!Okay so I have seen where a few people are sad about how cunning and manipulative George grew up to be or that Sophie hasn\u2019t completely overcome the tragedy from her childhood. But that made their stories even better to me. You didn\u2019t expect George to grow up completely normal did you? He was already brilliant, manipulative and powerful as a teen. He went to work for The Mirror before he was really an adult and he was fantastic at it. After years of that and heading up the Mirror he has honed him into the sharpest, deadliest and best planner/manipulator possible. Sophie on the other hand would love to not be the killer she became as a child. But her past shaped her and she still can\u2019t escape it no matter how much she tries. She hasn\u2019t accepted herself completely yet but I love the is on that journey and we come to her in the middle of coming to terms with the woman she has become and can\u2019t hide from.\n You are not a gentle flower who spends its whole life in a greenhouse. You are a wildfire, Lark. A wildfire.\u201d A sun burst on the images, its violent fury drowning the cosmos. \u201cDare to take that step and I will show you wonders beyond your imagination. I will give you a chance to make a difference. Come with me.\u201d George offered his hand to her. \u201cLive. Join me or not, but live, gods damn you, because I cannot stand the thought of you slowly aging here like some dusty fossil under glass.\n\u2665\u2665\u2665I SHIP IT!!!! George and Sophie Forever.\u2665\u2665\u2665Okay back to the story. This might seem to move a little slower due to the format of the story and it being more of strategic plotting type book than kill the bad guy sort of situation. It also has a darker tone to it. Dina is lonely, she has lost her parents and she is really taking the fact that Sean left to discover the universe and they didn\u2019t have a chance to explore what might have been a little hard. Plus it seems like at least the Vampires and the Otrokar have no serious interest in making peace as each has lost too much in battle. The deaths of their family and friends looms large. But don\u2019t get me wrong there are plenty of shenanigans along the way to sort of lighten the mood of the story and give a chuckle or two including another streaking scene due to coffee consumption. I missed Sean along with Dina\u2026yeah I know they didn\u2019t have much time together but I also loved the possibility of a them. But I also understood why he needed to travel a bit to discover a universe he didn\u2019t know existed until he met Dina.\n\u201cI asked him if he was leaving anyone behind. He said he\u2019d met a girl with stardust on her robe, and when he looked into her eyes, he saw the universe looking back.\u201d\u201cHe said that?\u201d\u201cHe did. The blood of Auul flows through him. We were warriors and poets, often both. I asked him if he thought this girl would wait for him, and he said he wasn\u2019t sure.\u201d\nI wasn\u2019t initially sure if I liked Sean\u2019s character development in Sweep In Peace but after some reflection I totally LOVE IT. For one he has been to the universe and seen some things, some really hard things. They have left him a little broken, and that is my favorite kind of hero. I think that before he wouldn\u2019t have been able to have a settled life with Dina at the Inn. But after the events in Sweep in Peace it is set up that they could build something together, there is a great amount of possibility there now. YAY!!!Dina\u2019s connection with the Inn is explored more and a few new characters are added to the cast. A yet to be named Cat (that I\u2019m not entire sure is just a cat) and Orro a prickly hedgehog-ish chef. Orro was simply fantastic and I enjoyed him and his high maintenance masterchef ways. The inn it seems is becoming a hodgepodge of interesting characters and each one brings something new to the party. There are a few new hints made about Dina\u2019s parents and their disappearance but no discoveries as of yet. I\u2019m super interested in figuring out what happened to them although we do get a glimpse of her brother Klaus *wink, wink*.This went better for me in ebook format and so I\u2019m upping my star rating to 4 stars. I\u2019m really excited to see what is in store next for Dina, Sean and Gertrude Hunt. Review of the Free Chapter Installment version On-LineThis is almost like a review of a first draft since I read this in the free chapter installments online. The cool part is that it is like being in on a beta read of the first draft of an Ilona Andrews book. I walked along with them as they developed the main body of a story but it definitely doesn\u2019t have their finished polish to it yet. I am really excited to read the final version of the story that will flesh out some of the things and make the overall story flow better. I have complete confidence in IA\u2019s ability to do that.The hardest thing about reading a book in chapter installments is the waiting. Between the chapters there was a lot of waiting and a few times it had to be put on their back burner as other commitments and real life trumped it. So I sometime forgot what I\u2019d read awhile back. Some of the installments I loved and others I just found myself waiting for something to happen. I don\u2019t think I would have noticed as much in final book format though.Having read The Edge series I was beyond excited to see George, Jack, Gaston and Sophie all grown up. It was an extra bonus to know their background but not really needed. Dina\u2019s inn needs some guests for its magic to grow, George needs a place to host a dangerous arbitration between three factions. Win-Win right? If only the arbitration was going smoothly, but there are issues and problems around every turn it seems right from the beginning.I enjoyed getting a look into some of the other beings in this world and the conflicts that arose between them. I spent a long time in the book waiting for Sean to show up and it might have been a bit distracting to me but I did like how that eventually played out. Still Roland is there with the Vampire faction and the vampires are as deadly and entertaining as always.Dina and her inn are fascinating characters to me (yes the Inn is a character it is totally like a living breathing entity in its own right) the magic and switch up to the usual vampire, werewolf and other lore are fascinating. I enjoy most of the ideas of this world.This book had a lot of minor flaws in pacing and sometimes forgetting a character was there for a while. I\u2019m not disparaging it as I love IA and I\u2019m sure that the final draft will be an improved version of this story. For now this is a 3 star book, subject to change on the final editionSuggestions: If you are a huge IA fan like me and want to feel like maybe you are in on the ground floor of one of their books\u2026then read this and then read the final published book and bask in your IA nerdism as you compare how the final book is to the chapter installments and if you notice all the changes. This is totally my plan #sorrynotsorry #idontcareifyouarejudgingmeIf you just sorta like them or have never read another IA book\u2026well don\u2019t start here. Wait until the final book is published and then read it. Clean Sweep is a pretty short book ~230 pages or so and a fun read give it a go first or else Sweep in Peace won\u2019t make nearly as much sense."}, {"userName": "\u2605\u029c\u0251\u028b\u0258\u0273\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12999658", "userReview": "[PrologueChapter 1Part 1Part 2Chapter 2Part 1Part 2Part 3Chapter 3Part 1Part 2Part 3Chapter 4Part 1Part 2Chapter 5Part 1Part 2Part 3Chapter 6Part 1Part 2Part 3Chapter 7Part 1Part 2Chapter 8Part 1Part 2Chapter 9Part 1Part 2Chapter 10Part 1Part 2Chapter 11Parts 1&2Part3Chapter 12Part 1Part 2Part 3+4Chapter 13Part 1Part 2+3Chapter 14Part 1Part 2 (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "Final review, first posted on Fantasy Literature: Dina DeMille runs a bed-and-breakfast inn that secretly caters to visitors from other parts of the galaxy. The magical, semi-sentient inn can create opulent new rooms and redecorate them at Dina\u2019s wish, with a blithe disregard for the normal laws of physics (what I wouldn\u2019t give to have a house like that!). But Dina is short on both guests and cash, so she\u2019s open to the idea when George, an arbitrator of disputes between different alien races, asks her to host an arbitration aimed at ending a bitter twenty-year-long war between three species, fighting over control of the vast mineral wealth of a desolate planet.The problem is that the three factions that have to agree to the peace accord are the militant Holy Cosmic Anocracy (i.e., space vampires), the equally aggressive Otrokars (aka the Hope-Crushing Horde), and the Merchants of Baha-char, who look like upright silver-blue foxes and have incredibly devious minds and an unswerving devotion to accumulating wealth. Normally the Merchants couldn\u2019t stand up to either the vampires or the Otrokars, but they have an incredible warrior hero called the Turan Adin who can single-handedly keep the other races at bay. The bloody war among the three races has left thousands dead and the survivors brimming with bloodthirstiness and vengeance. Not a great recipe for settlement negotiations! But even though a successful peace agreement between the three is unlikely, George is offering Dina a payment of a million dollars if the arbitration succeeds and half that if it fails. So Dina, against her better judgment, agrees to host the summit. She stands to lose her reputation and incur a devastating cut in her inn\u2019s star ranking if anyone is killed at her inn.Sweep in Peace, the second novel in Ilona Andrews\u2018 INNKEEPER CHRONICLES, improves on the first book, Clean Sweep. Now that the main characters and their world have been introduced to readers, there\u2019s more room for character development and intricate plotting, and it shows. Each of the factions has its own divisions and dissentions within it, and some of the participants have their own secret agendas. Almost everything that could go wrong with the peace summit does \u2026 but a few important things go right as well. The ending is heart-wrenching as well as exciting.In a rather bemusing but fun cross-pollination from the Andrews\u2019 THE EDGE series, George Caramine shows up as the galactic arbitrator, along with several of his friends from that series. George has grown up to be a fascinating and cunning man, a master manipulator who, just possibly, is not as heartless as he seems to be. Dina\u2019s empathy as well as her determination \u2015 including judicious use of her magical powers to quell disturbances \u2015 continue to play a key role in her stories.The subplots include Dina\u2019s amusing adventures in hiring and keeping happy a new chef, Otro the Quilllonian, who lives for both gourmet food and drama. Caldenia, an occasionally deadly galactic aristocrat and the inn\u2019s only lifetime guest, highly approves:A Quillonian chef. My dear, you shouldn\u2019t have. Well, you should have months ago, but one mustn\u2019t be petty. Finally. I shall be dining in a style to which I am suited. Fantastic. Does he have moral scruples? I am reasonably sure that this summit will result in at least one murder, and I have never tasted an otrokar.Ilona Andrews\u2019 INNKEEPER CHRONICLES series is a fantasy with a thin veneer of science fiction. As Dina commented in Clean Sweep, higher physics is indistinguishable from magic for those who don\u2019t understand it, and this series takes that concept and runs with it. For practical purposes, Sweep in Peace is in the urban fantasy genre, with just a touch of romance in this installment. The engaging, imaginative plot and liberal doses of the Andrews\u2019 trademark snarky humor made this a highly enjoyable read."}, {"userName": "Aisling Zena", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18444439-aisling-zena", "userReview": "Re-read 11/12/175 starsChapter 16 part 2 and EpilogueI've realised I've been reading this for a year now!

I have pre-ordered exactly three books this year and guess who wrote two of them? Ilona Andrews. When I know that a new Ilona Andrews book is coming out, I actually plan my reading time so that I will be able to finish whatever it is that I am reading the day before the book comes out. I only get two weeks of vacation time each year and I have seriously debated using a day just to stay home and read their books on the release day. So you can imagine how sad it makes me to only give three stars to this book. Three stars is a good rating and I think that this is a good book. It just wasn't knock my socks off good that I have come to expect from this writing pair.I decided to wait for the complete book instead of reading the pieces as they were released on their website. Which by the way...how awesome is it that they do that? At least I think it is pretty awesome. The fact that they are giving their work away to their readers just cements my love for this writing pair. They are just an incredible pair of authors.I loved Clean Sweep and consumed that book in less than a day. I even listened to the audiobook recently as a refresher so that I would be fully prepared for Sweep in Peace (not to mention that I just like the story - a lot). As soon as I had a chance to sit down and read on the release day, I dug right in to the story and noticed a few things that were different. I missed Sean. I missed Sean a lot. The dialog and interaction between Dina and Sean was really the best part of Clean Sweep. Sean's absence in this book really left a hole for me. The fact that no other character in this book was as strong of a character really made a huge difference. I really missed the dialog with Dina. I remember laughing at the things that Sean, Dina, and Arland said to each other in the first book. I didn't find the humor that I was looking for in this one. It actually took me several days to finish this book because I was able to put it down which is a new experience for me in regards to an Ilona Andrews book. This book felt really dark to me. Dina was much more serious in this one and it seemed that she was holding everything on her shoulders. I have only read the first book in the Edge series so I am not as familiar with George and Jack as other readers may be. This future for them still makes me a little sad. I didn't like them. All of the sides that are meeting at the peace treaty really seem to have lost a lot and still are finding peace difficult. In so many way, many of the characters were at their limit and many were at their breaking point.I did really enjoy seeing more of what Gertrude Hunt can do. The sky is the limit when it comes to this old inn. I was just amazed at how imaginative some of the features this house displays in this book. I really think that we have only seen the beginning of Gertrude Hunts abilities. As more guests stay at the inn over time, it will be exciting to see what develops as the series continues. I also really liked the new chef, Orro. Orro did add a touch of humor to the story but I think that this is a character that I will like more and more as the series progresses. Caldenia was awesome as always. I would recommend this series to others. Everyone should read Ilona Andrews. I seriously believe that. The writing is solid and the story is unique and interesting. I can't wait to see what is going to happen to Dina next. Initial ThoughtsI didn't like this book nearly as much as Clean Sweep...or really anything else written by Ilona Andrews. The story was good but it wasn't Ilona Andrews good."}, {"userName": "Carol.

I expected a paranormal romance direction and was pleasantly surprised to discover it was the challenge of an interspecies summit. Caldenia remains my most favorite character. Which, of course, is where the Andrews shine. Despite a host of delegates, they manage to create a sense of individuality for many. Well done.World-building worked better for me than in the first book. Multi-world/verse fantasy felt more developed. Apparently there is also cross-over from The Edge; don't know, haven't read it. Only mildly intrusive.Writing was much smoother; not so much info-dumping, or at least it was integrated better.Nice message, innovative solution."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Dec 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3344685-sarah", "userReview": "1st Read - June 20152nd Read - November 20153rd Read - December 20164th read -October 2017Full ReviewIt's no secret that I'm a total fangirl when it comes to Ilona and Gordon Andrews, in fact I've probably said that at the beginning of nearly all my reviews of their books, and I'm completely addicted to their Inkeeper Chronicles. I love the way these stories are initially posted in free instalments for fans to read online, we get to comment on the story as it's written and I think the feedback received possibly helps take the stories in slightly different directions to where they could have gone if they were written in the traditional way. As much as I love following that process it's a unique kind of torture having these amazing stories dolled out in tiny pieces over such a long time period so I was desperate to get my hands on a final, finished copy so I could read it from start to end in one sitting.So, I've read Sweep in Peace twice now and I absolutely devoured it this time around. The series is just getting better and better and I adore Dina and the other characters. I'm going to assume that anyone reading this review will already have read Clean Sweep so I'm not going to give you background information on Gertrude Hunt or Innkeepers in general - I'd rather focus on this story and what's so fantastic about it. I'm loving learning more about Dina's family (I still have high hopes that we'll meet her siblings one day and I desperately want to see her solve the mystery surrounding her missing parents!) and also about Innkeeper abilities. Dina is basically master of the universe when she's inside Gertrude Hunt, what she says goes and I love seeing her lay down the law when she needs to. Most of the time Dina bends over backwards to make sure her guests have everything they could possibly need but anyone who pushes her too far should be very, very careful because payback will be a bitch!Long term inn resident Caldenia is fantastic, she's like a sweet old lady one minute but then she'll be creepy as hell the next and I love how unpredictable she is. Beast is her usual cute and charming self but she's also very quick to defend Dina and her territory when needed. Then we have a new (hopefully permenant) cast member Orro, a fabulous but disgraced chef who looks set to keep Dina on her toes but I'm sure his wonderful food will make it worth the effort. I'm going to admit I was disappointed that we didn't see more of Sean in this instalment, I have such high hopes for him and Dina so I was hoping for a little more romance BUT I actually think the development of his character was spot on and although he wasn't around as much as I'd have liked I'm very hopeful that's going to change in the next book.Now let's talk about Dina's latest guests. Anyone who has already read the Edge series are going to be thrilled to spot some familiar faces and I have to admit to some very excited happy dancing when George first makes an appearance! I loved the younger generation of characters in the Edge books and it was so much fun to see the fully grown up and now out in the world living their own lives. I really hope that we'll see more of them in the future, either as guests in the Innkeeper Chronicles or perhaps in a spin off series of their own - I think George's new job gives plenty of scope for at least a couple of books but I'm not sure Dina will be so keen on having him as a guest again any time in the near future!Dina finds herself facing the challenge of a lifetime when George approaches her asking if she'll host a peace summit at Gertrude Hunt. George is working as an Arbitrator and it is up to him to bring peace to a war torn planet. Unfortunately that means meeting the demands of all three interested parties, each of whom has their own unique customs and requirements. War has been waging on Nexus for twenty years with much bloodshed and loss on all sides but most people are more keen on avenging their dead than they are on bringing about an end to the fighting. It's George's job to find a solution but it'll be up to Dina to keep all three groups separate and prevent anyone killing each other during the talks.As great as it was to see George (and a few other character's who I'm not going to name drop because it'll be more fun for readers to get a surprise) I have to admit I was surprised at how ruthless and calculating he has become. He was always intelligent but he proves here that he's willing to do whatever it takes to achieve his goals even if it does mean he ends up making himself a few enemies along the way. I actually kind of admired him for doing what had to be done but there were more than a few times I wanted to punch him in the face, particularly for the way he used Dina and put her at risk by withholding information from her. He's definitely turned into a very complex character and I have to believe we've not seen the last of him or his allies.Sweep In Peace is wonderful, it has everything you could hope for from a book by Team Andrews - great humour, quirky but realistic characters and a well thought out world full of unique and unusual creatures, customs and history. Now Ilona and Gordon please, please bring on the torturous release of book three, in tiny bite sized portions that will have me desperately begging for more and stalking your website on a daily basis! I can't wait :o)__________________________Mini Review after 1st read:I managed to hold out until the whole story was available before I started reading it & it was definitely worth the wait! It's not going to be on the website forever though so if you want to read it while it's free you'd best do that ASAP. Of course I'll be buying the finished version once it's gone through the editing process so I'm going to hold off until I've read the final story before I post a full review but I'm loving this series.Here are a few highlights:- Love Dina's character, everyone always underestimates her but she is more than capable of holding her own & proves it time and time again.- Beast is adorable & I like the new edition to the Inn's pets.- Shaun, we didn't see enough of him in this book but he's still my favourite!- I love that the series links to the Edge books and that we got the chance to catch up with some familiar faces (even if one of them did piss me off by being a manipulative bastard LOL).- We get to meet some interesting new characters and I'm already looking forward to the next book :o)Thoughts before I read it:It has a NAME!!!!!!!! Sweep in Peace I LOVE IT!Also, Ilona and Gordon have posted the first chapter on their blog!! I think they're aiming to post a chapter each week like they did for Clean Sweep but chapter one is already live!Check here if you want to read it:http://demo.ilona-andrews.com/categor...I'm going to try and hold off, at least until a few more chapters are available but it's soooooo tempting to start it now!______________________3rd ReadI love this series more every time I reread it. Ilona & Gordon Andrews write some of the best series out there, their world building is second to none, their characters are kickass and amazing but flawed enough to feel real and the stories hook you from the first page.I'm a fully pledged member of the Andrews' fan club!"}, {"userName": "Jo \u2605The Book Sloth\u2605", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13870608-jo-the-book-sloth", "userReview": "[And then there was.

Specifically the Innkeeper Chronicles series! Clean Sweep! Sweep in Peace! ALL OF HER BOOOKS!This is, by far, the BEST urban fantasy I've ever read. EVER EVER EVER READ. You're probably thinking, \"But, Faye, didn't you say a few months ago that it was Ilona Andrews'\u00a0Kate Daniels series that was the best you've ever read?\" That tidbit was very much true... until I've stumbled upon her more recent work, to which I would gleefully and willingly pay a limb to read the succeeding books. As soon as fucking possible.Okay, fine, I'd also sacrifice a limb to read Anne Bishop's\u00a0Marked in Flesh (The Others #4), too, but that's a post for another day.I'd like to talk about why this book was the bomb, but seeing that this is the second part of a (hopefully long) series, I'd just go and talk about why it's AWESOME-SAUCE in general.1.) AMAZING PREMISE. This is a series that is not boxed in by a single idea alone. You can see so many urban fantasies out there that are chained by their own premises - a world rife with vampires is only full of vampires. A world rife with werewolves is only full of werewolves. After these creatures, most of the time, there is no more room to grow and expand. Not unless you build the book up exceptionally, you can't just introduce a whole new creature to get to know and explore in a setting that has already been boxed in. But that's not the case with this series at all; in fact, you could even say that the possibilities here are just so endless. Welcome to Gertrude Inn, one of those neutral grounds on Earth where space creatures can take refuse in and rest as they travel the cosmos.Which means, that's right - from vampires to sentients, from space foxes to space giants and other fantastic creatures - you have them all here. The space is literally the limit. There's so much potential here for different dynamics and extensive world-building, that even I feel so excited at the possibilities. In the second book, there is a summit to be held at the Gertrude Inn among warring space races, to finalize what needs to be done about a war that has been ongoing for decades and decades. Can you just imagine it? The powerful Vampires, the powerful Hope-Crushing Horde, and the mischevous Merchants of Baha-Char in one place?It's gonna be a riot, let me tell you.2.) AWESOME WORLD-BUILDING. And because of this, the world already feels so grand and big and FANTASTIC, and I really commend Ilona Andrews on how she's building it up. We don't have all the information immediately, but the things the first two books have already shown us definitely laid the foundation and successfully made me covet even more. You know that feeling where the book already has enough world-building set up and yet YOU JUST CAN'T WAIT FOR MORE?! I am on the throes of suspense here as I wait for the future books to provide us even more introduction to other series, worlds, and situations happening in the universe.Maybe it's because I do believe in aliens and that I see the universe and the cosmos as one big romantic thing waiting to be explored and deciphered.Or maybe this series is just too great for words.3.) AWESOME HEROINE. As an innkeeper, Dina has her oaths. She has to be neutral when it comes to space-political issues. She has to ensure that the human population must not know of these space creatures' existence. And she has to have visitors from outer space in order for her inn to survive, as it sustains itself with the magic and presence of these otherworldly visitors. And for me, she is super kick-ass. She may not be as reckless and impulsive as Kate Daniels in Andrews' other series, but she is undeniably charming and endearing in her own right. I mean, seriously, how can anyone not be amazed by someone who can keep up with all these powerful space beings?Seriously, though, read this author if you haven't yet.

All it takes is a thought and intent. If you are an innkeeper connected to the house, which Dina is, of course. Her magic is awesome. Love Gertrude Hunt (the inn's name)! In this one, Dina gets approached by an Arbitrator named George (apparently he is from The Edge series - crossover!). George is an asshole if you ask me. I didn't like him. Anyway, he approaches Dina to have some HUGE peace talk thing in her inn. It's doomed, but Dina does it because she needs the business, the inn needs the energy from guests, she needs the money, her inn needs good ratings, etc. etc. Well, it's three alien groups: vampires, short beings who resemble foxes, and another species who resemble humans but are much larger, stronger, and just look a little different (I wasn't quite sure what exactly distinguished them from humans besides size and skin tone maybe)?There were some cute additions to the series - Orro, the hedgehog alien master chef (love him), the new cat... but I kind of struggled with this one. It wasn't a page-turner and not as good as the first one, in my view. I felt disconnected from Dina for most of the book. She just seemed too \"even,\" controlled, unemotional, a little flat. I do like her, but I wanted more complexity.I loved Arland and he was in this one too, but in an unremarkable role. I'm really starting to get the feeling the Andrews don't like vampires. Every time a vampire shows up, something bad happens, and there's no chance of any romance. TEAM ARLAND FOREVER!It's obvious who Dina is going to end up with. I just don't feel the insta-love with her and Sean. Sean was hardly in this either. He's great and all. But still.Just kidding. He's great for Dina and his little \"thing\" at the end was exciting and unexpected. Dina negotiated her way into brilliance in the last hour. ARLAND IS MINE.I don't know, something was missing.

I try not to let this influence my reviews of their books, and in fact I think it makes me judge them a little more harshly in some lights, but the fact of the matter is that I just flat-out enjoy their stories. It's hard for me to find serious faults with them. And when I'm having fun, when I'm invested, and when an author can bring out the sort of emotions that Ilona Andrews manages - well, that results in an excellent review from me.Dina's stuck in the middle of some serious peace negotiations - where neither side is really sure if they can even begin to compromise on their terms to reach peace. Each faction wants peace, I think that much is clear, but I think I've never had a fiction novel show me so clearly how hard it is to get to that when you've got years of war and devastation behind you. This novel struck at my heart for many reasons, not the least of which was the fact that war is devastating. I think that's clear from our current events, and peace is something we need now, more than ever. I find myself wishing that we could protect all of Earth's inhabitants with a peace summit - even one as difficult as the one here. I wish I'd written this review yesterday, before I heard about the devastation that's happened in Paris, before I was reminded about how much we hurt each other on this planet. I'm finding it hard to think of anything else, now. This is an excellent book. A great addition into the series, and I really, honestly, can't wait to see where they take us next. The world keeps getting bigger - when you have a full universe to work with, it should - and I find there are more and more characters that I care about and want to see a LOT more of.The stakes are high in this novel, not just for the races seeking peace, but for Dina herself. If you've read The Edge series, you're familiar with George and Jack - we get quite a bit more of them here. And all I can say is that it's not enough. I need so much more with them, because it's more than obvious that none of their stories are finished yet either.Ilona Andrews is my favorite author. With good reason. I'm starting!

Good points:-Loved Orro, he was so hilariously melodramatic and was by far the best thing in the story. -Loved the setting of the inn and the whole magic system, not to mention all the various species and planets that were shown, the world was just a lot of fun to immerse into.-Jack, Gaston and Sophia's presence, they didn't play big roles but they were great when they were in it. Bad points:-Dina was a massive doormat, she let George fuck her and the inn over and over again. I expected her to ban George and give him a piece of her mind at the end but the silly cow actually let him get away with everything after he told her some lame sob story. She needed to make him suffer for all the crap he pulled, her writing him up as a problem guest was nowhere near enough comeuppance. I hope she actually gets her spine back in the next book. -I loathed George, everything about him grated on me. His smug-insufferable-manipulative-thinks-he-knows-it-all ways made him utterly unlikeable and not in an interesting way. I actually found George far more endearing and three dimensional when he was a kind and straightforward child. This new older George was rubbish, he was meant to be ruthless yet at the same time we were meant to feel sorry for him because he was suffering and of course he was only being a douche for the greater good. Ugh, he can't be a tragic hero whilst being a grade A manipulative, using, lying bastard at the same time. Characters like that can exist but they need to be written in a convincing way and George's characterization wasn't written in a convincing way. Spending 90% of the story being a dick only to give a bunch of sorry excuses at the end wasn't good enough, it didn't make me like him or root for him or feel sorry for him. On top of that, I was meant to believe he was so intelligent that he could pull anyone's strings to dance to his tune (no matter how clever, experienced or jaded they were). Yea, no-one's that good at manipulation. Also, him admitting he was a ruthless, selfish bastard didn't magically absolve him of all his wrongdoings. I've noticed recently this nonsensical trend where the hero/love interest does awful things yet somehow they get away with their sins by simply admitting that they're selfish, ruthless, bad etc as if admitting it somehow makes all the crap they've done okay. It's such a dumb, ridiculous way of excusing 'tortured' male characters of all the bad they've done. Ugh.-Couldn't bring myself to care about the politics/conflict on Nexus, it was mostly boring. -The ending with the memory sharing stuff felt far too easy, I didn't buy that a decades long, bloody war could be settled in such a cheesy and convenient way. It was far too unrealistic.-Sean turning out to be Turin Adin came across as nothing but contrived. Also, him becoming all weary and experienced about various worlds/species annoyed me, it felt like it was done just so he could be more wiser and knowledgeable about things than Dina. Whereas in book one she was the one who was in the know, which was a welcome role reversal from the usual wide eyed heroine and know it all hero.I hope there's no George in the next book, Dina's character was bought down all so he could be portrayed as some kind of master manipulator. She needs to get back to her old not to be messed with self instead of the mess she was in this one."}, {"userName": "Jilly", "userReviewDate": "Feb 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25894509-jilly", "userReview": "There was a series that Ilona Andrews wrote called The Edge series.On the Edge It had two young brothers, George and Jack, that were sweet, adorable, and each troubled in their own way. We watched them grow-up during this series, and we all wished there would be more books that showed us what became of them - especially since another child, Lark, was added into the mix. She was also a work in progress. Well, those characters show up in this book. Yay! Right?.. uh, no. Not yay. This book is a case of some things are better left unsaid.some stones shouldn't be turned over. Just leave it alone.Why do I feel this way? Well, from what we see of them now, life hasn't treated them kindly, and they are pretty hardened and messed-up. The good thing about them from the Edge series was that they were on the road to healing. But, something must have went wrong because George is manipulative and cynical, Jack is just a lethal killer, and Lark has been unhappy in a self-imposed prison for years. And, apparently they took off, simply leaving a note telling their sister and family that they would be gone for the next 20 years. What the hell happened?We turn our backs for a few years and everything falls apart! So, the return of the Edge characters didn't work for me.Now, let's talk about our main character, Dina. In my last review, I compared her personality to a rock. I also wondered why both a werewolf and a vampire were interested in this rock-girl. I guess it's called the Bella Swan Phenomenon. Or, maybe it should be classified as a sickness or disease. Well, anyway, Dina has sunken deeper into her role in the Bella Swan Phenomenon (maybe it's a virus? The Bella Virus. Yes! I like it!) and is displaying more Bellalike behavior. You see, in the last book, Sean decides he needs to go and see this world that he didn't know existed and travel in space. That was 6 months ago. And, Bella Dina is still thinking about him and pining over him. Really? After 6 months? They knew each other for less than a week 6 months ago. He should have been a blip on the radar at that point.Well, Dina definitely has the personality of a hipster vegan...So, Dina gets the opportunity to host a summit of peace talks to help stop a war on a distant planet. There are three groups represented, along with George & Jack who are the mediators. Of course the vampire group includes the guy that was supposedly interested in Dina in the last book. But, seriously, for a guy who says he's interested, he doesn't show her any interest at all. I'm not sure what vampire courting looks like, but if he's any indication it involves not talking to her, not hanging around her, and leaving as soon as possible. If disinterest is their way of flirting, he's in love.There are a lot of good things in this book as well. Mainly, the new chef that Dina hires to feed all of her new guests. He is described as a giant hedgehog, and he is glorious.Squeeeee! How freaking cute is that? I want one!Orro is a drama queen. He freaks out and throws things, he cries, and he wallows in depression. He's my new favorite character. Like I said, Ilona Andrews writes amazing side-characters.

It was cute, so unique nothing else came to mind that resembled it, fun in the potential future romance department, adventurous, just plain good. Now we have a much wanted-sequel, but here the brush bristles fell a little flat.Don't get me wrong - it's \"good\". It's still unique and inventive, as the plot is ridiculously complex, digging into that supply closet filled with bizarre science-fiction style politics, creatures from other planets, a politically charged war fought in the Nexus. The ending was a creative way to solve a major issue and fix another one - my hat off in respect to the talented imagination of the authors when it comes to crafting plots, climaxes, and resolutions.They faltered a bit with everything else, however; the downtime was too repetitive and I felt like most of the book was an educational journey. I didn't latch on to the characters to care enough before I was bombarded with info-dump left and right. Some of the scenes were amusing and some charming, but most of them just not that interesting.As the innkeeper, Dina is cool in her abilities but she sparkled more in the original. Armand is still a fun character but he seems a little less shiny and kind of faded in the background. Orro was the award winning addition - I\"ll be happy to see more of him in the future.

Although it will be interesting to read the other series to understand their story better.Dina is back in the second instalment of the Innkeeper Chronicles.

He wants her to host a peace summit in her Inn, between three races who are killing each other over one mineral rich planet. It could be the opportunity that she is looking for to up her inns standing, however she also knows its most likely going to end in disaster! And how the hell is she going to feed so many people, vampires and other strange creatures!??YAY!!! NO LOVE TRIANGLE!!! Oh how I loved this book so much more because of the LACK OF A LOVE TRIANGLE! Sure, the vampire still has the hots for her, but Dina's heart belongs to a sexy alpha werewolf... However... WHERE THE HELL WAS THE WEREWOLF!! 2 minutes of the book had Sean in it! Seriously! So obviously the romance was almost NADA - Sorry folks!!But what it lacked in romance it made up for with wit, action and mystery. Killer story! Literally! I loved this one! Loved the magic, loved the plot and loved the action! There was only one more tiny little thing that turned me off it and that was it was a little slow in places. Listening to it was actually a challenge because I would keep losing interest and literally have to rewind it 10 minutes or so to figure out what on earth was happening! Might stick with paper/kindle versions of the next one. Don't get me wrong the narration is excellent, but it didn't quite hold me all the time. But of course it did have parts where I refused to take the headphones out of my ear because it was so good... I think it needed more Sean!I enjoy Dina's character, even though at times she can be a bit high and mighty for my liking. A bit too goody goody. But that's just her, and I still love her. I can't wait for more books to come out and I can't wait to get into finding out what happened to her parents.Would I recommend it?Yeah for sure! So much fun!

It\u2019s a gift, though, that I choose not to take advantage of, simply because I don\u2019t have the patience for a serial. And just as with Clean Sweep, I am so very glad that I waited to read this story all at once. I loved it every bit as much as the first book, maybe even more.It\u2019s been five months since we last saw Dina and the Gertrude Hunt Bed and Breakfast. It\u2019s been a bit lonely since Sean and Arland left, taking all that danger and excitement with them. But now, Dina has a new challenge. An Arbitrator has approached her to use her inn as a neutral site for a peace meeting among warring nations. It\u2019s risky, but the money she earns and the magic her guests will generate for the inn are too tempting to turn down.Let me stop here and share my thrill over the Arbitrator, who is none other than George Camarine, one of my absolutely most favorite characters from the Edge books. You don\u2019t have to be familiar with that series to enjoy this story at all, but I loved George and his brother Jack so much, it was truly a joy to see them again.Anyway, the meetings are fraught with peril. And they\u2019re filled with both new and familiar faces. Old friends like Nuan Cee, the Merchant Dina did business with in the last book and Arland, the sexy vampire warrior, mixed with new characters like Dagorkun, of the Ortokari Horde and the lovable (at least to me) and high strung chef Orro. The result, a rich canvas of engaging people who surround Dina as the peace talks slip further and further from her control.As with the first book, there are only hints of romance. Sean does show up at some point, but this is one step slower than what you\u2019d even consider a slow burn. That does not mean I was in any way unsatisfied. There is plenty enough going on here to keep me invested. I\u2019m fascinated by the worldbuilding and I love how Andrews is growing new layers to it, introducing us to different kinds of beings and their cultures.I love Dina, her determination and no-nonsense attitude. I am, of course, completely enthralled with George, Jack, and Lark, though part of me is sad about the fact I missed so much of their lives in the interim since they were teens. I\u2019d like more Arland \u2013and a little more development for Sean. If he\u2019s our guy, I need to start getting to know him beyond the soldier and selfless protector.But the bottom line is that it\u2019s all good enough that I didn\u2019t want to put it down and I am left wanting more. The story really moves; the pacing is great and the plot is interesting. I would definitely recommend. You can\u2019t go wrong with Ilona Andrews.P.S. I love the illustrations. George is so pretty.Rating: A*ARC provided by author"}, {"userName": "Cyndi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7132123-cyndi", "userReview": "Excellent series! Ok, in the small town of Red Deer, Texas a lot of unusual things are happening in the Gertrude Hunt B&B. In the middle of it stands a cute little blond innkeeper with a broom and her little Shih Tzu.  But, she's not a regular innkeeper, she has magic. Her guests aren't regular either. One is an assassin with a huge price on her head and most of the rest of them are vampires.  Although there are a lot of terrific characters in this book, I think my favorite is the inn, Gertrude Hunt. It's sentient and attached to Dina. It creates rooms to specifications, cleans the floors of bodies and keeps the occupants in line.  Wonderful book!"}, {"userName": "Julio Genao", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3977017-julio-genao", "userReview": "\"es que lo quierooooooooooooo.\"fun. a little less fun than the first one, but that's the challenge of serially-produced fiction, i guess.even dickens published a couple mushy chapters in a row now and again."}, {"userName": "\u2665Rachel\u2665", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5481477-rachel", "userReview": "I want the next one!"}, {"userName": "katwiththehat", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54835325-katwiththehat", "userReview": "This sequel to \u201cClean Sweep\u201d sees innkeeper Dina alone at her inn trying to figure out what she can do to get more guests and sustain her future as an innkeeper, as well as her beloved, living inn. When a man appears and asks her to host a dangerous conference, but for a large sum of money that would help make ends meet, as well as perhaps bring peace to a corner of the galaxy, Dina says yes even though many others have turned him down. This had a TON of world building and lots of palace intrigue as the different factions at the peace conference tried to get all sneaky.

Her inn defies laws of physics, her fluffy dog is secretly a monster, and the only paying guest is a former Galactic tyrant with a price on her head. But the inn needs guests to thrive, and guests have been scarce, so when an Arbitrator shows up at Dina's door and asks her to host a peace summit between three warring species, she jumps on the chance.Unfortunately, for Dina, keeping the peace between Space Vampires, the Hope-Crushing Horde, and the devious Merchants of Baha-char is much easier said than done. On top of keeping her guests from murdering each other, she must find a chef, remodel the inn...and risk everything, even her life, to save the man she might fall in love with.
