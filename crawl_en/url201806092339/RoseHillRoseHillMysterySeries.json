Rose Hill is situated in southern US, population 500, plus tourists and the students at Eldridge College. The College is named for the wealthy Eldridge family. Another wealthy family are the Rodefeffers. Further down the social scale are the Irish Fitzgeralds and their relatives and friends, who are among the main characters in this interesting series.The books revolve around the everyday life of the town and the people who run the bakery, the bookstore, the service station, fire station, police station, funeral parlour, city offices, the pub, and the churches. Everyone knows everyone else and their business. They are supportive and helpful of their family members and neighbours in good southern tradition. Among the everyday life there are mysteries and murder, fraud and skulduggery, love and relationships.I read the first seven titles but had to give up when the eight involved a sociopath. I don't read sociopaths, psychopaths or serial killers. Book nine started out interestingly until the issues with feral young Sammy raised its head again.The thing is, the author has created an interesting array of characters, well drawn and interesting. You want to spend time with them, find out what's happening next in their lives. I mean, I read those seven titles in less than a week. But the author also uses her books to expound her ideas and attitudes to life and the way people should live, none of which I particularly disagreed with, but which often turned into sermons in the mouths of her characters. I tended to skip at times. Young Sammy seems to be her sermon on child raising - namely, let a child run free without boundaries and you're raising a problem. Not wrong, but a little goes a long way.So seven out of the nine is my limit. But I did enjoy those seven."}, {"userName": "Sharon Michael", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5048256-sharon-michael", "userReview": "Readable mystery that was borderline between okay and liked it. The biggest problem for me was that part of the plot was structured around a scam involving dogs that isn't possible now because of DNA typing and the storyline was current timing. I'd have liked the book more if I wasn't involved myself with purebred dogs and AKC registration and didn't know that part of the plot was impossible."}, {"userName": "Drebbles", "userReviewDate": "Mar 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1862888-drebbles", "userReview": "Theo Eldridge was a bully and very much hated in Rose Hill, so it isn\u2019t a surprise when someone finally murders him. The only real question is who the killer is and police chief Scott Gordon has plenty of suspects who all have reasons to want Theo dead, including his own family. A potential eyewitness to the murder is missing and Scott would love to find him. Scott works reluctantly with Sarah Albright from the county sheriff\u2019s office while trying to avoid her passes and trying to convince Maggie Fitzpatrick to enter into a relationship with him. Rose Hill may be a small town, but life there is complicated.Often when reading a book, it will take me to a place that\u2019s fun to visit, but I don\u2019t miss it when I\u2019m done. Other times, I\u2019ll visit a place that I miss long after I\u2019ve finished reading the book. \u201cRose Hill\u201d, I\u2019m happy to say, is the latter. I loved my visit to Rose Hill and was sorry to see it end. The book is full of interesting characters \u2013 Maggie, Scott, Sarah, Sam, Hannah, and many more \u2013 all of whom are multi-layered characters with secrets all keep buried, sometimes even from themselves. Rose Hill is a small town and author Pamela Grandstaff does a great job of making Rose Hill come alive and capturing small town life. Scott is one of the best developed characters I\u2019ve come across in a mystery novel. He doesn\u2019t gossip and consequently misses a lot of what goes on around town. He is weak and easily manipulated, especially by his mother, and he knows it. He and Maggie are an interesting couple and I want to know what happens to them next and more abut what happened to Maggie in the past that makes her so reluctant to commit to a relationship. The mystery elements are well done and readers will enjoy trying to figure out who killed Theo, but it is the characters that drive this novel and make it work so well.I loved my visit to \u201cRose Hill\u201d and hope to visit it again. Well done."}, {"userName": "Quillracer", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10979943-quillracer", "userReview": "This is a \u2018not quite\u2019 book. It\u2019s not quite a romance, not quite a mystery. And it\u2019s not quite fixed anywhere. I never had a solid feel for where the story was located beyond the Rose Hill of the title. There were times it seemed to be set in Pennsylvania. Other times, the words and descriptions used were more common to other areas of the country. As a result, I never felt \u2018grounded\u2019 in the story.The same was true for many of the characters. They were so indistinctly drawn that except for Scott, Maddie, and a few others, each time I encountered one, I had to stop and think who that person was and his or her relationship to other characters. They never became \u2018real\u2019 people, just names on a page. The characters also mostly came out of Central Casting. We had the town bully, the wounded war vet, the snobby woman who looks down on the town and citizens, the rich old lady who insults every one she talks to. None of the mothers approved of the person their son or daughter married. Almost all the men and women had the morals of alley cats. Many of them were at least borderline alcoholics. The writing was very basic as if aimed toward a middle grade audience. Although some sentences were so convoluted, I had to read them several times to understand their meaning.I didn\u2019t hate this book but it wasn\u2019t good enough to qualify as okay. So it only earns 1\u00bd stars \u2013 Did nothing for me.I won\u2019t visit Rose Hill again."}, {"userName": "Bridget", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1797491-bridget", "userReview": "Rose Hill is the scene of the crime. It's your average, small town gossip haven. Theo, the town bully and the town drunk, has been found dead. None of this small town's population are saddened. Actually it's quite the opposite. It seems everyone has had words with Theo at one point or another. Most people in the town believe that they are better off without Theo around. This makes police chief, Scott Gordon's, job very difficult.Maggie Fitzpatrick, a fiery redhead with attitude, owns the local bookstore and Scott's heart. Maggie and her best friend Hannah, go looking for clues on their own and uncover a secret so big that it incriminates almost the entire town. I really enjoyed this book. Pamela is so good with her descriptions that I feel like I was actually a part of Rose Hill.

The characters were well developed even if a little numerous and hard to keep track of at times. When the town bully is murdered and his sidekick disappears, everyone becomes a suspect. In the solving of the crime, lots of small town gossip surfaces and you realize the people you think you know, you really don't. Even the post mistress isn't what she appears to be on the surface.

The book starts with the introduction of a rather despicable man who made me wonder if I really wanted to read the book. The character also had me wondering how this could be a \u201ccozy mystery.\u201d Very quickly the story changes to the tale of a small town that has its population boosted by college students and tourists. The characters are developed as the book goes on. The characters are interesting as the town tries to figure out who may have committed a murder and past possible murders, who is interested in whom as friendships or romances grow, a bit of jealousy, other crimes that are discovered, a nosy county sheriffs officer, and who are the \u201cscanner grannies\u201d who get the town gossipers going."}, {"userName": "Cindy", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54077754-cindy", "userReview": "Hooked!This is a book filled with true to life characters and believable storylines.

The small town of Rose Hill is brimming with secrets, blackmail, domestic violence and murder. As the Chief of Police Scott Gordon keeps the peace while trying to do right by the good people in the town and is in love with Maggie Fitzpatrick. She runs a bookstore /coffee shop and does not want to acknowledge her feelings for Scott so they remain friends bickering constantly to ease the tension between them. Hannah is Maggie's best friend, married to war vet Sam. She is the county animal control officer, picking up stray dogs and cats and caring for them while finding them homes. She is trying to fix Maggie up with the new veterinarian since Maggie seems determined to resist Scott's advances. The newspaper editor Ed is Scott's close friend and a sometimes sounding board. There are many other characters who play more or less important roles in the town (and the case) including the scanner grannies who listen in on cell phone conversations to find out what's going on! Although this is a murder mystery that must be solved, the victim is a nasty character with many enemies. No one seems to regret his death. The county homicide detective, Sarah, has taken over the case but spends much of her time trying to seduce Scott and bossing him around. But Scott, with the aid of Maggie and Hannah, sets about to solve the case. All the characters are complex and well-realized. I found myself laughing out loud at many of their shenanigans. There were so many possible suspects I wasn't sure of the perpetrator's identity till near the end. There also were loose ends at the end of this story that will continue into the next books so I recommend reading them in order. So on to #2!"}, {"userName": "Marleen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1616365-marleen", "userReview": "Regrettably, I have to say this was a boring and repetitive read. There were hints, here and there, of a possible better story, but it didn\u2019t deliver. Scott Gordon is a small town cop who runs around in circles (and around, and around) in order to solve the murder of a man hated by almost everyone in his small town. Scott\u2019s not working alone. Firstly, the case is taken over by the county sheriff\u2019s department in the person of a very brazen young female deputy, then, at the end, it\u2019s taken over by the FBI. In parallel, two townswomen, a bookkeeper and her cousin try to solve some aspects of the case, as well.The greatest flaw of this book, is that the author introduces too many characters. In itself there\u2019s nothing wrong with a big number of characters contributing to story. No, not a problem, but they contribute so little to the story. Their interactions are redundant. The same goes for the encounters (romantic or otherwise) and the various other connections made, story-lines introduced, lead us nowhere, most of the time. If you put people together you at least give them depth and give meaning to their non-relation, but here are relations \u2013 and yes this is a light book \u2013 and even there the author doesn't give the reader closure. What's happening with Scott and Maggie?Like with a dance, or with a painting, you want to say \"finish the line\".A disappointment, all in all."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2042927-mary", "userReview": "I was lucky enough to receive a copy of this book from Librarything.com member giveaways.

It drug on in some places and there were a LOT of characters. I almost never have to do this, but I had to keep going to the Kindle X-ray to figure out who a character was and how they fit in - there were just too many to keep up with. So as I was saying... the book drug on and on and gave too many details of things that didn't matter, but not enough of what you needed to know to keep up with the story. Then in the last few pages - a million things happened all at once. It was almost as though the author got sick of writing (and dragging it out) and she just finished it in like 10 minutes over three pages. Bam!There were enough dogs and cats to give it a three-star rating. Also, there were several things that happened or were referenced and made a big deal of and I thought, oh, this will play into the story or become important later, but nope - just strange things kind of hanging out there that didn't really tie into anything or get wrapped up in a neat little package."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10643549-judy", "userReview": "This is a mystery set in a small town, with the main character being the police chief, who grew up there, and knows everybody in town.
