I saw some reviews that said they read the first 10-20 pages and quit because it was boring. This is where the author is setting up who the characters are on the outside of the game which is super important later. There is a reason the author doesn't jump right into game mode. This is plotted very well and bleeds out little trickles of info just enough for the reader to get hints of what is going on. It keeps you guessing and wanting you to continue to read. The action is fast and furious. You think the main guy is evil, he is not. There is more to this guy then you think. There is a lot of depth to the characters and you really get to know them, even some of the NPCs. I already bought the next book and will read and review it too.

I don't know how to review this book.It was fun, that's one thing. It had a likable protagonist, a fun setting, and in interesting premise. This is probably my first full LitRPG, and the audiobook was really well narrated.But there are some glaring flaws. The antagonist is a clich\u00e9, worse than many terrible comic book villains. Any scene with him was actively annoying, and I disliked the character not because he was a good antagonist, but because of how much he resembled a bad comic book villain.I also wish I feared for the main character a bit more, as you don't really feel that he is in danger at all throughout the book. The story and narration were enough to pull me along, and I did enjoy myself, but I wish I could have been a little more invested in the characters.But, y'know, I did have fun. Giant battles with exploding zombies, skeleton creatures, and the undead. Fire mages, Ice mages, Necromancers... This is a damn fun book, especially for fans of video games.So yeah, the book does have its flaws, but that word \"fun\" keeps popping up.

During the control tests with beta players the AI system that controls the whole video game starts going rogue. The AI named Alfred is over riding protocols, and doing things he wasn\u2019t designed to do \u2013 like access players memories. Alfred is supposed to be one of the most advanced AI\u2019s ever created, and the game developers are nervous, but ultimately put the game through beta rounds into general public release.The main character was expelled unfairly from school, and spends much of his time playing this game, farming items for real world money to make it by.Alfred continues to do things the designers hadn\u2019t intended, building an interactive world that\u2019s unprecedented. It\u2019s like WoW but incredibly enhanced. One of the more interesting parts of the game is that there\u2019s both pleasant and unpleasant sensory feedback. Pain is a real part of the game and was included intentionally by the game designers to deter people from callously running into battle without a care \u2013 it can be turned down, but the pain feedback can\u2019t be turned off entirely.Alfred had made his own decision to base the magic system in game based on players personality based off a test you take as soon as you get intoCharactersJason: The main character of the story, he\u2019s an 18 year old who\u2019s parents are mostly absent from his life, they go around the world and do conservation activism leaving him to his own devices most of the time. Jason is a typical nerd enjoying video games, has very few friends, and a crush on a girl. Overall I was surprised his personality type in the real world turned out to be what it was in the game.Alex: The antagonist, and my least favorite part of the books. He\u2019s a psychopath who\u2019s Jason\u2019s school bully. He doesn\u2019t just punch people in faces being a general jerk, he also dismembers his pets and other animals.Riley: Jasons love interestAlfred: The AI who controls the entire Awaken Online video game.Claire and ___ two POV\u2019s of cerulean entertainment \u2013 Claire has protested the release of the game due to the unknown capabilities of Alfred to control the minds and bodies of players. ____ is the opposite and pushes opinion and he eventually wins out. (I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m blanking on this guys name)PacingThe beginning starts out a little slowly, but when you get to the action scenes it goes pretty quickly. There are some info dumps, but because I found how the video game worked and how characters level so interesting I didn\u2019t mind. If you find that shit boring, you\u2019ll be bored.Pros and ConsProsI want this video game to exist so badly, it\u2019s set in the year 2074 so virtual reality has been fine tuned and is incredibly immersive, with sensory feed back including pain it sounds like an amazing world to try and explore. The personality based magic system is also highly appealing, whenever I play video games I\u2019m almost always healer class (if it\u2019s that kind of video game) so reading through someone be the \u201cbad guy\u201d was interesting since I can\u2019t ever make myself do it. Sometimes with Mass Effect 2 I\u2019d get bored and try to create and evil character just to see if I could make it through the game in a new way, I always quit shortly after I make the character, I just feel bad being a jerk even if its directed at pixels. Watching someone be an evil character is fun for me to watch though, the zombies and monsters Jason is able to summon is really cool, and watching him plan out how to take out whole groups of people by himself using summoned monsters was fun. I did want to learn more about this world and video game after finishing the first, and I did automatically pick up the next book and finish it fairly quickly, I enjoyed the story a lot.ConsThere were a ton of cliche\u2019s and tropes in this book where I feel like there was no depth. The antagonist is at the top of that list because I don\u2019t buy his back story creating the level of psychosis he\u2019s displaying. His dying mother who probably had mental issues slaps him on her death bed and calls him weak, he then cries at his mothers funeral and his dad tells him to stop showing weakness. First, it\u2019s incredibly strange for parents to act like that, but even if they do say that kind of shit to their kid, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to make him go home and gut the family dog and turn into an utter psychopath.Audience:* People who like LitRPG and don\u2019t mind info dumps on rules and magic* LOTS of magic* LOTS of fighting* read more for having fun than reading for polished work. This book was fun but was rough around the edges like many debut novels.* people who like cat companions.http://weatherwaxreport.blog"}, {"userName": "Shaun", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7453053-shaun", "userReview": "This book was hard for me to rate. On the one hand, it really was not a great book. The dialogue was pretty shoddy, the characters were shallow, the writing was not great. The big \"twist\" (that the main character was a bad guy) occurred almost immediately as soon as the \"game\" part of the book got started. The \"RPG\" side of things got incredibly repetitive (hey, I wonder if he will put these stat points into willpower?), and often the action plodded along as our narrator had to spell out problems in way too much detail even though they were quite straightforward based on the actions that previously took place (e.g., obviously he feels betrayed that the chick sold him out - do we really need for him to explain his emotions in so many sentences? Please assume some intelligence from the readers). Lastly, the central motivation of our hero (he doesn't have much money, people hate him because he is poor) is not particularly believable. It seems made up, rather than a problem the author actually has any experience with. Not saying that people can't get made fun of because they are poor - rather, the author does not convince me that it would look and feel as he decribes.And yet, and yet. I found myself pretty hooked on this book, despite all the annoyances described above. I was intrigued by the world that the author set up. I was occasionally surprised by things that happened, and the action was pretty fast paced (even if some of the sentences were laborious, as noted above). Bottom line, this isn't a well written book, but it is a pretty good story."}, {"userName": "Carla Enright", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1306781-carla-enright", "userReview": "The synopsis on Goodreads is pretty great, and honestly, if you're the type of nerd who reads that synopsis and is intrigued, or thinks it may be good, you're probably going to like it. I feel the only time someone wouldn't like it is if RPG books aren't their thing. I happen to love them, which is why I looked for a book like this in the first place. I sifted through a few books, and I'm so happy this one was the book I chose. Okay. Enough of the recommendation details.Why I enjoyed the book:It was a captivating book!It's an interesting take on RPGs, and the NPCs are wonderfully entertaining as well. The BEST part about the book is the complexity of the characters. A key thing that turns a good story into a great story is making sure you see both the good and the bad to characters. It gives them depth, allows you to understand them, and also makes the characters REAL. I have a weird thing where I want not to like the good characters (get frustrated or upset or mad at them) and empathise with the bad characters at one point in each story I read, listen to, or watch. This book's on the concept is based on having your main character, who you like, actually be a bad guy in the RPG and be able to understand why. The only issue is how annoyed I was when it ended. It's always frustrating when you read a series that has yet to be complete."}, {"userName": "Lindsey", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42785839-lindsey", "userReview": "3.5 stars. Knocking down a half start just for the beginning of the book. I don't expect that it would be an issue (hopefully) continuing the series. The book started out with some shenanigans of repetition and odd parents. Jason is picked on for being perceived as a welfare kid, despite the contradiction of having parents that don't seem to work and go gallivanting off as activists. I could rant on the parents, so maybe their extremely brief presence in the book is just that strongly (or repetitively) written. Jason as a character is actually a good one. He goes through some big downs early in the book which could have definitely led me to dropping the book early. But the AI system for Awaken Online was interesting enough to keep me hooked until Jason's success was important to me. The book summary implies Jason is question his motives more than the book portrays, or at least I interpreted from either. Also, I think the pain aspect might have needed more exploration for Jason. Despite my complaints, I enjoyed the book after getting past that beginning hurdle. I will be very likely to continue the series. This is an above average book. Fingers crossed that the next installment will be as interesting as this became. The AI system,Alfred, was a huge part of what really drove my interest despite being more of a background/side story. And it really worked being that way."}, {"userName": "Teruko", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13538253-teruko", "userReview": "Great first bookWell written, intelligent main character, and doesn't end in a huge cliffhanger.

"My original Awaken Online: Catharsis audiobook review and many others can be found at Audiobook Reviewer.\u201cAwaken Online Catharsis\u201d is the first of two books in the Awaken Online series written by Travis Bagwell.\u00a0 The audiobook edition is richly narrated by David Stifel who has voiced books in nearly every genre provided on Audible at the time of this review.\u00a0 The book is best classified in the Literary Role-Playing Game (LitRPG) subgenre.\u00a0 It is a rather large book compared to others in its class coming in at 526 pages for the Kindle edition and over sixteen hours for the audiobook version.\u00a0 So, what sets this book apart in a rather crowded space?\u00a0 With a plethora of books about heroes conquering the evils of the land, this book reverses that perception and instead tells the story mostly from evils point of view.\u00a0 Think of what \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d would have been like if told from the perspective of the side of Mordor.\u00a0 If you are a gamer, enjoy fantasy, like coming of age stories, and enjoy playing a more chaotic focused character, I think you will enjoy the story Bagwell tells in this book.\u00a0 Be aware that the book can be quite graphic and rather dark at times, so I would not recommend it to very young readers.I found it interesting looking up the word \u201ccatharsis\u201d, it relates to: purification, cleansing, purging, or liberation.\u00a0 Each of these words are dealt with in this book.\u00a0 In short, the book is a coming of age story where the main character becomes a hero, an evil hero that is, within a virtual MMORPG (Massive Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) created by a rather shady corporation.\u00a0 This company may have lost control over the game\u2019s Artificial Intelligence (AI) system and must hide this fact from the authorities.\u00a0 All of this begins unraveling while the main character\u2019s physical life is also in shambles with school, parents, and friends.\u00a0 His one true escape is in this newly created virtual world called Awaken Online or AO.\u00a0 The book takes place in the near future and is mostly written for the Young Adult (YA) audience.\u00a0 I say this because most of the adults in the book are stereotypical of ones found in Disney movies.\u00a0 Often idiots, seeking the child\u2019s forgiveness, and ignorant to the events occurring.\u00a0 Adult characters are not frequently seen throughout the book.\u00a0 This aspect does not ruin the book, but I\u2019m sure you will notice it by the end.\u00a0 When I was done listening to the book, it made me think of the \u201cBreakfast Club\u201d or \u201cFerris Bueller's Day Off\u201d movies set in a MMORPG.As one would expect from a fantasy book setting, there are many of the standard tropes such as zombies, undead, skeletons, plenty of magic, weapons, crafting, drunk and bumbling guards, different types of magic, heroes, demi-gods, etc.\u00a0 These and many more are found within the pages of this story.\u00a0 Not only do you have such fantasy items, but you also have the inclusion of technology such as AI, corporations struggling to maintain their dominance and monetize their success. \u00a0There were many message and dialogue boxes cluttering the screens for those who have previously played such types of games.\u00a0 I often found that when a new item was discovered, I could visualize the system providing me the details as they were read along with the extra audio beep letting me know it was a system message.\u00a0 I did laugh out loud as the author described the dreaded \u201cFog of War\u201d often found on adventure game maps, I always was the one to have to clear every bit of it before finishing the game.\u00a0 The book brought back so many vivid game playing experiences for me.\u00a0 I also thought the author\u2019s ability to describe a scene was quite good.\u00a0 I never felt lost for the events or scenery while listening.\u00a0 What worked less for me were the many times our main character had inner dialogue.\u00a0 As critical decisions needed to be made, we as the audience were able to listen in on his inner conversation.\u00a0 This is more a personal preference than an issue with the writing style.The book\u2019s narration was performed by David Stifel, who I\u2019m happy to say also narrates the second book in the series.\u00a0 It is always good to have consistency in an audiobook series.\u00a0 I liked the narrator\u2019s deep and rich voice which added some to the dark and ominous feel to the story.\u00a0 For a book of its size, there were only a few slight issues, but nothing that would prevent someone from listening and enjoying it fully.\u00a0 I came to like the added audio sound effects used when a new item was discovered or some other system event occurred.\u00a0 Often these minor subtle additions can make a story all that more interesting as long as they are not overused or take away from the story itself.\u00a0 The sound quality was on par with other professionally done audiobooks I have listened too.\u00a0 The only minor thing I will point out is that there were a few slightly noticeable volume inconsistencies; again, these can be expected for a book of its length and they were hardly noticeable.For parents or younger readers, this book is rather dark at times and does contain some brutal and graphic violence found in many other fantasy books.\u00a0 The book also contains a fair amount of vulgar language usage.\u00a0 This surprised me for a fantasy series, however I believe the author was trying to write more toward the YA crowd then younger readers.\u00a0 The book also has a few references to sexual and/or crude humor.\u00a0 There are topics or subject matter that would not be appropriate for younger readers, and I would suggest this age group find a different book to read. \u00a0Or, if you are easily offended by anything mentioned above, this book is not for you.In summary, I overall enjoyed the book as I thought it added a few things not seen in other LitRPG books.\u00a0 The writing was not overly complex or deep, the focus on telling the story from the evil perspective was rather unique, and it fills one\u2019s desire for a solidly written and narrated LitRPG book.\u00a0 The book has received a number of acclaimed reviews, so it seems like it has been well received.\u00a0 If it sounds interesting, I recommend you give it a listen.Audiobook was purchased for review by ABR."}, {"userName": "Matt Ward", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2017", "userURL":

I'm not sure, but I'm doing one to counteract all the positivity. I did a bunch of research to find the \"best\" place to get into the LitRPG genre. Yikes! This better not be the best it has to offer.Let's start with an analogy. Your ten year old (non-prodigy) plays through a challenging violin concerto in the privacy of your home in front of family. It's a spirited and entertaining rendition, but far from professional. No one would dare put her on a stage and charge money as if she were a professional.Do you see where this is going? Let's take Travis Bagwell's own profession. No one would dare try to represent someone in court without the years of necessary legal training.That's kind of why it baffles me that people think it's okay to slap up the book they wrote on Amazon and charge people money for it. This belongs on a personal webpage or in the hands of family and friends, or, at the very least, make it free on Amazon.Just like any profession, the art and craft of writing takes years of practice to get good at. It's a lifelong journey. A first-year creative writing course could use this book for an entire semester as an example of what not to do. It shocks me that Bagwell didn't even look up basic things every grade-school student learns before hitting publish.Here's a few consistent issues that come to mind (meaning they weren't typos). There are many, many more.Elementary errors:-Incorrect use of quotation marks-Improper punctuation of dialogue-Passive voice-Excessive adverb use-Tense confusion-Unnecessary redundancyIntermediate errors:-Incorrect comma use-Flat, on-the-nose dialogue-Tells instead of shows-Dangling modifiers-Excessive, unintentional alliteration-Lack of motivation or tension to move the story forwardAdvanced errors:-When showing, chooses unimportant or common details-Weak or confused characterization-Lack of clear value shifts and turning points at the scene level-Lack of consideration of prose style (bonus points for reflecting mood or action)Now we're professional:-Doesn't consider how internal and external global shape can contrast to create dramatic tension-Underdeveloped voiceI really don't say this to be mean. I liked the story. Just like the child playing the concerto can be spirited and entertaining, this was spirited and entertaining. I want to be clear that I'm not saying \"hire an editor\" or \"there's typos,\" as some other reviewers have put it. There's an experience gap that has no easy fix other than for Bagwell to hunker down with dozens of books on the craft of writing and slowly start to get these issues under control. It takes 10,000 hours of practice to get good at anything, and writing is no exception.My hope is that he's gotten better with future books. My guess is that since he's not so embarrassed by this one to make it free or to rewrite it or remove it entirely, nothing has changed."}, {"userName": "Adam Cagle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44403345-adam-cagle", "userReview": "This is a FAR better RPG story than Ready Player One, which was great more for the litany of 80s references. Awaken Online is set in 2074, but the world is not unfamiliar, the story is told from two sides in such a way to build GREAT plot tension around the game and all that it is.The complete VR emersion for players makes the in game world as real as everything else as far as story. While it also deals with High Schoolers, the plot is far more violent and adult than Ready Player One as well... I only even compare the two as they are in my mind the two pinnacles of the genre. The morality struggles in Awaken are fantastically presented.

High overall score and positive reviews. For me, after experiencing the content from several genre flagships, this was a logical step forward.But this time, I already have a certain demands from a good LitRPG book. The backstory, the characters, the VR world, the chemistry. Quality expected.Starting with the backstory, I think it is shallow. Author tries too hard to justify the behavior of the main character and overdoes it. This makes it less believable from my point of view. Estimated level is somewhere on the pre high-school. This goes to the characters as well. Did not work for me. I am feeling bored when someone tries to persuade me a 100 times in something that is very simple. And to prove the point he tries to make it more complex to be better understood. No thank you.VR world is ok, there is nothing revolutionary, but there are some variances which can be liked. This would go on the plus side. There is a good potential in the whole book, it is just wasted on things that are not developed or not important.I wasn't drawn into the story so strong as in other LitRPG. I wanted to finish the book and I did it, but without repeatable \"This is so good, I have to read one more chapter\"There is also a sequel which I haven't started.

I prefer to be swept up in something of the science nature, maybe a little something with a touch of fantasy or maybe a bit of a mystery/thriller. That being said this book blew me away. I actually looked forward to coming home and diving back into the Twilight Throne and sinking into the war that was fast approaching.The online world that Mr. Bagwell paints is hands down one of the most stunning and beautifully crafted worlds I think I've ever experienced. Between the descriptions of the Awaken Online (AO) game and the character backgrounds/development both in game and in real life I was hooked. What I enjoyed most though was that you didn't follow the stereotypical \"hero\" with this story. You follow someone who has essentially been beaten and messed with at every point in his real life who finally has enough and puts it to an end. Someone who is finally done dealing with all of the crap and takes matters into his own partially evil in game hands. What I loved most about this book was the actual in game notifications you would actually see if you were actually playing a video game. I loved watching him level up and earn new traits, or add his points to different stats to ensure he was prepping himself to the best of his abilities. You get to watch him plan out his attacks, use in-depth strategies to conquer his enemies or even just to defend himself.My only real complaint about this book would have to be that for me it started off slightly slowly. That being said I completely understand why it did so, and even agree with the slow beginning. You really need to get some of Jason's backstory so you can understand why he does some of the things he does in the game.

But I think that what makes it cool is that the author created the game world. It's a game from his imagination. Obviously, the gaming part is going to be more complex than the characters in their real lives. But, I can see how this is great escapism for gamers who like to read. I will try the next book."}, {"userName": "Stan Faryna", "userReviewDate": "Jul 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36656411-stan-faryna", "userReview": "Awaken Online: Catharsis was Travis Bagwell's first book and the novel is praised by many to be one of the finest examples of the popular science fiction subgenre called LitRPG - a subgenre that mostly reads like an MMORPG game (Everquest, World of Warcraft, Elder Scrolls Online, etc.) is played. I enjoyed Bagwell's exploration of the confused, immature, and selfish ambitions of the adolescent male gamer personified in both the protagonist and antagonist. The real hero, in fact, is Riley, a young woman. But she doesn't play a large role in the story. Riley is the only character that takes responsibility for her actions. This was a pleasant surprise as most LitRPG is known for the male chauvinism characteristic of Russian and Eastern European culture from which it comes or was inspired."}, {"userName": "Nina", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10053783-nina", "userReview": "That was a great read. Other then \"Ready Player One\" I've never read a litRPG book and ... wow I really liked it. But never got to know why Jason was singled-out by Alfred from the beginning. I am sure there are other players killing off their first targets? I would have - doesn't mean I would go evil through-out the game. In my fav MMORPG I am a Necromancer too but doesn't mean I am a villain ... I just like to kill with my minions.Yes I agree to many before - the pre-story for Jason is pretty standard young adult content but I loved Jason's character development and how he turned out .. question is: with or without Alfred??Overall excellent fun exciting and gripping read ... totally recommend it."}, {"userName": "Mike ", "userReviewDate": "Jun 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2956865-mike", "userReview": "Good debut.

I think the world building that was done was great, but I enjoyed the parts of the book that focused on characters besides Jason and Alex. Since they are arguably the hero and the villain of this story, that is a bit of a problem. Jason's aunt and the developers mentions in the story were much more interesting to me because I felt like they were more \"real\" well rounded people. Overall: Fun ride, but you have to like the main character to really enjoy."}, {"userName": "David Benefry", "userReviewDate": "Nov 16, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15600591-david-benefry", "userReview": "\u201cAwaken Online: Catharsis\u201d by Travis Bagwell \u2013 Beyond the Veil of the VillainTravis Bagwell Takes Us Into Our TomorrowAs the story begins we are introduced to Jason, a man who is basically fed up with his reality, with his inability to influence it to his contentment. There are no real redeeming factors or rays of hope for him to look forward to, and so he seeks a means of escaping his existence, a prayer answered in the form of a new virtual reality game called Awaken Online. It promises players an unprecedented level of fidelity, enough to make them forget the real world ever existed. Needless to say, Jason quickly decides to give it a shot but finds his expectations heavily subverted as he finds himself without any goals or enemies. Slowly but surely, the realization dawns on him: he is not meant to be the hero, but rather the villain.A World Fully RealizedVideo game novels are understandably a very recent phenomenon, but it's been gaining in popularity very quickly as a genre thanks to many stellar entries from celebrated authors. Bagwell is quite obviously well-acquainted with this literary genre as well as the video gaming industry and he succeeds in creating a world that is completely believable with flying colours. The world is very detailed and realized to the fullest, making us feel like there is history behind every single item and character we encounter, even if it's never explicitly stated. The rules are laid down in a very clear and concise manner, completely logical and understandable without requiring any additional suspension of disbelief. All in all, the setting was seamlessly crafted, and in turn this set the stage for a powerful plot.A Multifaceted StoryAs far as the plot itself goes, I have to say that it was incredibly interesting to see things from the other side of the hill, to really get a good, book-long look at the face of villainy and what drives it. It's quite fun to be rooting for the bad guy for a change, especially since it's taking place in a video game, the one place where being a sinner is perfectly acceptable. The story that takes place in the virtual world is the real meat of the course, so to speak, presenting lots of engaging characters and thrusting them into glorious battles that keep you sitting on pins and needles. The story also bears a great deal of philosophical weight, examining the moral ambiguity that comes with being a bad guy, even if it is in a virtual world. We explore the way in which Jason's experiences in the virtual world shape his perception of the real one, how the two worlds interconnect and interact with each other. The Final VerdictTravis Bagwell is without a doubt an exceptional writer with a whole world's worth of talent and potential left to explore. Awaken Online: Catharsis is his first novel and it's definitely one of the best books you can find in the LitRPG genre. If you are a fan of this literary genre or are looking to see just how good it can get, then I absolutely recommend you get your hands on this novel. If it's any indicator, Travis Bagwell's works may very well be considered classics one day.This was an abridged version of our review.
