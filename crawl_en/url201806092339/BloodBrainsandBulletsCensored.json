The redeemer is the writer actually had a good story flow, one i enjoyed reading."}], "description": "***WARNING - CONTAINS GRAPHIC VIOLENCE, HEART RENDING TRAGEDY, AND EXPLICIT SEXUAL CONTENT.******THIS IS THE CENSORED EDITION AND CONTAINS NO EXPLICIT SEXUAL CONTENT ***Please contact the author if you purchased this version by mistake and I will send you the expanded edition.Professionally Edited Edition. Approx. 138,500 words. 400 pages.Blood, Brains and Bullets is Book One of the new Blood, Brains and Bullets series by Sean Liebling and starts on day one of the outbreak and continues through the first seven full days after it's apocalyptic climax.Jay has started his daily routine as a single father of three when the news hits of massive deaths then reanimations from the vaccine distributed by the government to combat the super flu virus that had been sweeping the globe. For Jay, it's irritating because it interrupt's Jay's normal comedic attempts at nailing every sweet piece of ass in the area. Being a survivalist means he has a lot of 'stuff' as you can never have too much and before he can even take shelter in his homemade retreat to ride out the apocalypse, friends start showing up who need his help. Before he knows it, he's forced into the unenviable position of assuming leadership over his community, or what's left of it, and fighting on multiple fronts against the forces of the evil undead, marauders and assassin's of the secret shadow government with a secret New World Order plan. Of course, that plan of theirs doesn't include him and his, so this Marine does what all Marines do best. He kicks ass without bothering to take names, while along the way he happens to fall into the clutches of a girl or three. Women can be very demanding. Even during a Zombie Apocalypse!Jay is a dedicated self-styled player who gets lucky more often than not, and has a soft spot for children. As one of those survivalist's they always talk about on the news, he's better prepared than most when the shit hits the fan. During the coming days and weeks, he will be forced through circumstances to grow up (reluctantly) and strive his utmost to save his community, while melding close friends, survivors and salvaged military units on the run, from assassination forces of a secret shadow government dedicated to a New World Order through a 200-year-old Eugenics plan. But it isn't over yet, because Jay is a Marine, and he has a few tricks up his sleeve, which he fully intends to implement while accumulating as many girlfriends as possible.This series will make you laugh hysterically at Jay's womanizing antics while being forced to grow up and act his age, then crying like a baby during scenes of heart rending tragedy and sacrifice, as it depicts real life tragedy and situations. It will also make you cheer when and if the forces of good triumph over those of evil. Written with the help of a Medical Doctor and Doctor of Psychology along with survivalist friends of all stripes, the scenes you will read inside are what really happen in an endgame situation with a comedic spin to it.This book is a testament to what Good Men can do when Doing Nothing simply isn't an option! The trick you see - is to act quickly and decisively. Being a Marine also helps of course!", "title": "Blood, Brains and Bullets Censored", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19208992-blood-brains-and-bullets-censored", "average": 3.65, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1428079068l/19208992.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6966374.Sean_Liebling", "name": "Sean Liebling"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19208992-blood-brains-and-bullets-censored", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17449322-blood-brains-and-bullets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24042014-the-god-warriors", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18111675-legacy-of-the-living", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20257369-the-reaper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29866377-no-remorse"]}
