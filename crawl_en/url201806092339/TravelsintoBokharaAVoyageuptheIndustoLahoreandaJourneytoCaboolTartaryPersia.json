An under-cover British agent on an intelligence gathering mission in the1830s, giving his first-hand account. An episode of \u2018The Great Game\u2019, when no-one in the British Empire knew whether the Indus was navigable, or what was really happening in Central Asia beyond Kabul. A spectacular success with a very sorry end. Altogether fascinating!"}, {"userName": "Frank", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/334551-frank", "userReview": "Great edition to a masterwork of travel writing/human observation A thrill for numismatists and travel buffs alike. Nice edition with explanatory notes. Burnes was a humane man, far ahead of his time. Very readable, not overwrought Victorian prose.

Despite the differences the land has undergone in nearly two hundred years, it is highly poignant relevant to activities in the same region today."}], "description": "At the age of only twenty six, Alexander Burnes proved himself to be one of the most effective intelligence agents of his time. Making two dangerous journeys beyond the frontiers of the Indian Empire, he reported back via the East India Company to Downing Street on the geography and politics of the kingdoms that lay to the northwest as far as fabled Bokhara. He travelled simply, disguised as a local, but with his rapier-like mind, an ear for languages and an infectious charm and curiosity, he had a formidable arsenal of talents at his command. In 1835, the publication of Burnes's Travels into Bokhara made him a celebrity in London, where he lectured to packed halls and was even given an audience by the King. This edition brings the heady sense of excitement, risk and zeal bursting from the pages.", "title": "Travels into Bokhara: A Voyage up the Indus to Lahore and a Journey to Cabool, Tartary & Persia", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16445980-travels-into-bokhara", "average": 3.86, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1356202092l/16445980.jpg", "reviews": 4, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/629169.Alexander_Burnes", "name": "Alexander Burnes"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/86550.Kathleen_Hopkirk", "name": "Kathleen Hopkirk"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/60159.William_Dalrymple", "name": "William Dalrymple"}], "type": ["History", "Travel", "Autobiography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16445980-travels-into-bokhara", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14559689-travels-into-bokhara", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19249670-travels-into-bokhara", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31145676-travels-into-bokhara-illustrated", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1315779.Cabool", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35754431-travels-into-bokhara", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26929819-travels-into-bokhara-vol-1-of-3", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8539697-travels-into-bokhara-containing-the-narrative-of-a-voyage-on-the-indus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30397103-travels-into-bokhara-being-the-account-of-a-journey-from-india-to-caboo"]}
