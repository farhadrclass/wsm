I think I am going to absolutely love this series. First off... zombies. Just..MEEP. Anyways, book 1 centers around Red losing her family and becoming the BADASS ZOMBIE SLAYING BEAST that I love. Then she meets Trace (hehe. LOVE) in a totally cool zombie infested WESTERN TOWN. I am sorry, but I love that combination. Western + Zombie. *nods* YES. Trace is so clueless when it comes to zombies, but I forgive because he is so adorable, sweet, but still no pushover. Him and Red are AWESOME together. They have good chemistry. I mean, it wasn't a *OH MY GODS, MY PASSION FOR YOU BURNS SO HOT, THIS BOOK MAY CATCH ON FIRE* but it was an honest to goodness slowly developed friendship turned sexy times. ;) yep, yep. love it. The book has a nice homey feel throughout the second half. It was different from other zombie novels I have read, because these characters really develop some great relationships and build a HOME together. I loved all the side characters in this book. Wen was pretty badass. Caroline was a sweetheart, though she was a more minor character. While the book still has the cute little homey feel, there is plenty of awful gory gut- eating action for you to gnaw on. (haha... gnaw.. anyways!) The zombies were totally scary! All... trying to eat people's innards.. and stuff. (: They served the book well. Good job, zombies. On that same note, I LOVE the theme behind the book. I will not tell you, because I don't want to spoil.. but.. It was pretty awesome. The main idea is not entirely original as zombie fiction goes, but the development and actual story was wicked cool. But still a little disturbing. You won't find sunshine and unicorns in this aspect of the novel. And other parts made me SO SAD as well. The author may like to give you the warm fuzzy family aspect in some parts, but she is not afraid to break your heart or make you sick in others. *grins* I want to point out that the book is told in alternating third person between Trace (MEEP) and RED (YAY). IT only made me that much happier to follow both of my characters. :D You guys know how crazy I am about that. So.. *thumbs up* This is my status update from goodreads while reading Wanted: Dead or Undead. I just wanted throw it in here somewhere :\"This book is pretty good. There is not much gore for the most part- as it focuses more on the group and Red's inner turmoil over everyone relying on her. I love how we can dig into the characters as they grow throughout and they realize things about themselves they did not know before. (: Some of them are pretty sweet and I have to keep steeling myself against the possibility the author might kill them off- lol.\"Haha. Right after that update, I think a really gory part came up. lolAll in all, Book 1 is a Gory- yet homey, Heartwarming- yet disturbing, awesome read that I would recommend to anyone who loves Zombie fiction, strong female leads, sweet romances, or horror fiction in general. I feel like it is even tame enough for pure romance lovers (well, maybe not that one part..) Yeah okay.. maybe not tame enough for pure romance lovers. ;) book 23.9/5I had a serious emotional breakdown when I was around 56 percent through with this book. lol. I am going to be honest with you. I had a small problem with one of my beloved characters and almost stopped reading because they were pissing me off. O.O But then I thought about it and a lot of it was overreaction on my part. Some of it was justified because my character just CHANGED and I was a little dumbfounded. But it was a justified change and my character was having a moment, so I decided to let it go. I put my big girl pants on and told myself to stop being a whiny brat and keep reading. It got better and I am happy to say that I still loved the book. Not nearly as much as number one, but it was still good. (: And I am working towards forgiving this character. Not quite there yet.. but working. I will say this though, I was into the book enough that when that one part presented itself, I nearly lost it. haha. You can ask Tiffany, I was venting at her. But it caught my attention and stuck with me and it earned my respect due to that. Any book that can make me attached enough to the characters that when something goes wonky with one of them, I become that upset... well, *shrug* like I said, respect. You guys! There are more characters in this book that I have come to love. *smiles* meep! Oh. *shrug* And a few that I absolutely HATED. whatever, I'm over it. *pouts*I feel like in each book, a new character is added that I just want to hug so hard. lol. and in this book, that character is Kitchi. He was great. (:Also, this book made me smile so hard it hurt in this one part. It was just so hilarious to me and I completely sympathized with Trace. haha. Smiling just thinking about it. \"KAW!\" *giggle*And then BAM another part made me want to curl up in a ball. D:There was some serious darkness in this book and at some points I was just like... O.O You are going to break my heart, you MONSTER. lol. But.. I kind of loved it. I know, I know, I'm SICK. Also, WHOAH, Villain alert. O.O That is one crazy B*****d. *shudders*So.. all in all? The second book was slap full of some new and AWESOME characters with unique personalities, and plenty of dry humor. There was some crazy darkness, but there is still that fantastic underlying since of family love and devotion. Oh, right. Can't forget about those crazy zombies! :D They were all \"IMA EAT CHOO\" and people were all... \"OMA GAWD! D:\" It was great. :D book 3I finally got around to reading book three! :D I loved the first two books. Anything that couples cowboys with zombies is alright in my book, but this series has been pretty interesting. The series focuses more on the characters and their relationships, than it does on the actual walkers, but they are still a large part of it.This book pretty much followed the same theme as the other two. There was some heartache. Some Romance. More characters were added (I love the crazy chick!), but it is bittersweet couples with loss. There was some zombie slashing. I felt like it was a bit repetitive in some aspects, but makes up for it with some random twists you do not see coming. The journey is harder since Red is pregnant and wobbling around the west. She has more unfortunate thoughts and feelings she has to work through. Trace is still a little bit of a goof and has to navigate his own rough patches as well. Poor guy. I really felt for him in this book. The characters are pretty beaten by the third book, but cannot give up on their dream for a semi- normal life. This book broke my heart a little bit, but I loved the ending. The Epilogue was a great ending to tie up the books. I cannot wait to read Angela's other books. Everything just flows so well, and I can't help but like her characters. Like, I said, this book was a bit slower with less action. I think book one is still my favorite, but I really enjoyed the series. An interesting take on what would happen with zombies in the West. All in all, Dead Plains was a heartbreaking and raw read that put my emotions through the ringer, but made it all worth it in the end. 3.9/5"}, {"userName": "Laura Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7491783-laura-thomas", "userReview": "I have to admit I started reading this expecting a zombie western with lots of eating and being eaten along with some humor. What I got was so much more.The story starts on a nail-biting scene that leaves you with no choice but to continue reading.Trace is an opportunist, a card shark, a bit of a trickster. All he wants is to stroll through life with no complications. That wasn\u2019t hard until the zombies started moving westward.Red is a no-nonsense woman on a mission. Traveling west towards California, she\u2019s hoping to find her brother. He joined the cavalry to fight the zombies and she hasn\u2019t heard from him since.The zombie plague has consumed the larger cities on either coast and is rapidly extending to the midwest.Thrown together by a chance encounter, Trace and Red slowly begin to trust each other. They will have to in order to survive. As they travel westward, their group of two slowly grows, along with their attraction for each other. They both have secrets kept to themselves for fear they will shatter the tenuous bond growing between them.Angela Scott takes her time developing the characters and establishing her story, weaving in new characters along with their stories and building genuine relationships. The scenes were so well written I could swear I was there. I shuddered in horror, feared the worst, and sighed in delight.The cliff-hanger ending left my jaw dropping in surprise, already anticipating more. This ending is very satisfying and one of the best I\u2019ve read.***Survivor RoundupMy ReviewThe story picks up where it left off. The author gave me just enough back information to catch up and then the story took off, pulling me back in time, to the west and the characters I\u2019ve come to love.The relationship between Trace and Red strengthens now that some of their secrets have been shared.Red and Trace head out to gather much need provisions, making it past the horde outside. Their journey takes them to Mill Creek.The town is like undead central, zombies everywhere. Red\u2019s secret comes in handy as she slips past the zombies as if she\u2019s invisible, scrounging up as much as she can and heading back to Trace, waiting at the wagon. The zombies might not have noticed her, but others did, and now they want Red.She may have made it past the horde, but will they survive what\u2019s coming? Either of them?I always to into the next book in a series with a bit of trepidation. Will it give me the answers I seek? Will it be as good as the first book?My fears were allayed in the first chapter. Survivor Roundup is as awesome as Wanted: Dead or Undead.I\u2019m also big on character driven stories, so the group dynamics were important. Those of you who watch apocalyptic movies and read the books know it\u2019s not just about surviving the cause of it. It\u2019s also about making those life and death decisions, recognizing trouble when it raises its ugly head, and compromising when necessary. Their has to be give and take if the group is to survive. The author had me so wrapped up in her characters lives. Even the ones I couldn\u2019t stand.And for you die-hard zombie fans. Angela can write those gut-clenching, gory, munching and hacking scenes. What\u2019s a good zombie story without some gnashing and slaying. She does this so well I\u2019d call it writing in color.The ending for the first book was hopeful. One of the best I\u2019ve read. The ending for this one is darker, harder to take, and you do get left hanging. But that\u2019s what a series is all about. Just like your favorite TV show, you can\u2019t wait for the next episode.And there\u2019s a big surprise waiting for you in this one. You\u2019ll love it.***Dead PlainsMy ReviewThe end is here. I\u2019m not talking about the apocalypse. I\u2019m talking about this fantastic series.There\u2019s not much I can tell you without spoiling it. You\u2019ll be weaving through the undead as the author wraps up individual stories.Get ready for it. You\u2019ll not get everything you hoped for. After seeing and sharing so much together, the group will have some casualties and not just life and death ones.That\u2019s where the author shines. Having characters act as they do makes this final book so emotional. There\u2019s no nice, neat conclusion. Some scenes are hard to take. I actually cried a couple of times, that\u2019s how difficult some scenes were. But, there are also some scenes that put a smile back on my face.As with the first two books, the author wrings it out of you, giving and taking right to the end.Even her ending is emotional and I was sad to read the last words. I didn\u2019t want to let go.****There is so much to enjoy is this series. Angela has some compelling cover art and she nailed it with the titles.Offering her books as an omnibus is genius. I wish it had been available when I started this series. It\u2019s going to look great on my bookshelf.I recommend this book to everyone looking for a great read and a new series.I received this book for my honest and unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Nancy (The Avid Reader)", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7149266-nancy-the-avid-reader", "userReview": "I received a free copy of the book from the author for my honest opinion.In Wanted: Dead or Undead we meet Red who likes to travel alone and has no one to be responsible for if they get bitten by the zombies. It's hard enough trying to keep your own self alive much less a group of people. But the dude she calls Cowboy won't listen to her he follows her anyway. Cowboy thinks he knows her and has seen her before. Besides all that he is very attracted to Red. He likes the way she handles a gun and can kill a bunch of zombies quicker than most folks.Cowboy and Red meet up with this new guy Wen and he becomes a part of their group. Later on down the road they meet two little kids, Rivers and Fisher; yeah that is their real names. See their father loved going fishing and that is how they got their names. Red wants to be alone because she has a secret that she doesn't want anyone to know about. Her secret could cost her, her life or maybe even the life of one of her new family members, people that she is becoming to care about. So they all end up at an old army fort where they meet Caroline and her father Ira. Wen and Caroline become close real quick like.In Survivor Roundup we have some new characters join us Aponi and her little brother Kitchi along with Nash one of her kidnappers. Red's brother Davis also joins them after he figures out what kind of person John Gatherum really is. John has been using Davis to lure Red into his lair only Davis did not know this. John will do anything he has to in order to get his hands on Red no matter who it may hurt or how many lies he has to tell.Red has a plan she is tired of running and hiding from John so she is going to find him and kill him. Then she can go back to her \"family\" and not have to hide any more. She has to be quick about it or her \"family\" will not survive without her. Her \"family\" is waiting and depending on her to bring food back to them.In Dead Plains Red is pregnant with Trace's baby. Red, Trace, Wen, Caroline, Lily (Wen and Caroline's baby), Fisher, Rivers, Kitchi, Aponi and Davis, Red's brother are all out walking the Plains trying their best to just stay one step ahead of the zombies and any human that may want to take Red and use her as an experiment like John did in Survivor Roundup. Red is unlike other humans. She has a secret that everyone wants to know and wishes they had. They think that she is the answer to their zombie problems.All Red, Trace, Wen, Caroline and everyone else in their new little family want is just to find a safe place that they can call home, a place hidden away from other people so that there would be no one to recognize Red. But someone knows who Red is and what she is and they are out for blood. This person doesn't care about Red or her family all this person cares about his himself. I know you probably want to know who this person is. Am I right? Well guess what I really don't want to spoil the book for you so I am not going to tell you who this person is. You are going to have to pick up your copy to find out. But hey trust me you will definitely not be disappointed with the Zombie West Trilogy. It is one of the best zombie books ever written. Angela Scot is an amazing writer and person."}, {"userName": "Kysha", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9725930-kysha", "userReview": "Wanted: Dead or UndeadAt first I wasn't real sure what to expect from this book. Zombies in the Wild West seemed a little much to take in. But as soon as I started reading I was hooked.I didn't think I would end up liking Red or Cowboy at all. In the beginning they were both very unlikable, arrogant and stubborn. But as their story (and love) progressed I started to like them a lot. Like most zombie stories, this one had little to do with the walkers and more about human nature in the middle of a disaster.The secondary characters, Rivers, Fisher, Wen, Caroline, and Ira, really made the story enjoyable and moved it along.There really wasn't anything I didn't like about the book or the story line.Survivor Round-upI had to buy this book after reading Wanted Dead or Undead. There was no way I couldn't know what happened to Red and Cowboy.As the group got split, we don't know anything of Wen, Caroline and the kids until the end. The addition of the Native Americans and Davis was a good thing. I am usually leery of the addition of that many new characters, but they are key to the groups survival.The relationship between Red and Nash was touching and creepy at the same time, think Stockholm Syndrome. I was happy to see that John got killed. He was a !!@#$%^. I feel really bad for Trace, that man gets the short end of the stick everytime.I look forward to the 3rd book.Once again I cannot say anything bad about the writing style or the structure.Dead PlainsI was given Wanted Dead or Undead and as soon as I finished it I had to buy Survivor Roundup. Then I had to wait.I loved all 3 books equally. There is a very good flow between them. Nothing is left out or skipped from book to book.I love Red and her feistyness. Trace is such typical guy. The kids are all great. I don't care too much for Davis though. The whole time I kept wondering what he was going to do and why. He just seemed so shifty, and he proved me right. I was so upset by the way he tricked everyone and played with their emotions and lives. I feel that he got what was coming to him after Red and Aponi left him.The scene of the birth was both intriguing and terrifying. I was so scared that something horrible was going to happen. After the birth we get to see a sharp change in both Red and Trace. I liked that Angela Scott made both parents feel so lost and yet determined. At no point did the pregnancy and birth seem easy or unreal, to me at least.Adding and subtracting characters can be tricky in a series, but Angela Scott handled it well. With the dangers encountered everyday for the group it makes sense that they would lose people. Adding people added danger and kept the story moving. I was upset by the deaths, but enjoyed the new girl. She is so much like Red.Once everyone was back together it was nice to see them enjoy something for a while, even though it was just a water fall and then a journey. I was so glad they found a homestead in the end.You must read the epilogue, it will make you smile."}, {"userName": "Ginny Lurcock", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23291028-ginny-lurcock", "userReview": "I am such a jackass.I know, you're not shocked, but I'm going to explain anyways in a vain attempt to defend myself.See, Heather read \"Wanted: Dead or Undead\" ages ago, and she enjoyed. But when I saw the cover all I could think was \"PSSH... PARANORMAL HISTORICAL ROMANCE THAT HAS PRACTICALLY THE SAME COVER AS 'WILDER'S MATE.' WHAT POSERS.\"See? Jackass.Namely because \"Wanted: Dead or Undead\" is wonderful in it's own unique way.And it's just the first book in the trilogy.What I liked:How do I love thee, Zombie West trilogy? Let me count the ways:1 - Zombies: You know I love zombies. They are, by far, my all time favorite monster2 - The Wild West: Okay, you don't know this about me, but I adore Westerns. No idea if it was too much of the Duke as a child, or just something I was preordained to nerd out over, but Westerns, especially odd Westerns, get me every time.3 - Red: Holy hell, strong female lead much? Even when she starts out all bruised and battered and refusing to let anyone in she's amazing. And the growth she experiences? Forget about it.4 - Cowboy: Wait, I figured out the Western obsession. It's the kind of arrogant male lead who's not quite on the straight and narrow, but is all the more appealing because of it.5 - Wen: The thing I was going to type here was highly inappropriate. Instead let me just say that for a sidekick, he is absurdly BA6 - Kitchi: I wasn't going to name anymore characters by name, but Kitchi earned it by being the most epic tween in a zombie story, ever.7 - That sweet edge of pain when things don't go right: So often in this trilogy I was brought to the brink of tears, wondering how the hell things would turn out alright. It just didn't seem possible. Red and Cowboy's lives were just destined to end in heartbreak and zombie flavored death. And yet...8 - The most important and bestest thing on this list - The Epilogue: Which is really all I can say about it. Well, that and I wanted a smoke afterwards.What I didn't love:Basically, the only thing I didn't enjoy was that, after reading two very different zombie books back to back, when my husband didn't e-mail me back quickly my first thought was that zombies had gotten him. Hand to God. The word zombies really did flash through my mind.Not really a fault of the story.Just the opposite in fact.It's a story that sticks with you.Who I'd recommend it to:Fans of Westerns and Zombies, obvi. Beyond that, anyone with the inkling that they'd enjoy a story about real people in an impossible situation doing the best they can to survive."}, {"userName": "Lissette", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4008232-lissette", "userReview": "From the moment the plague came into existence, Red's life has never been peaceful. Previously bitten, she's now immune to the plague's effects. How that is possible, she doesn't know. Nor does she want to. That piece of knowledge is better left untouched. At least, that's what she tells herself each and every day.Determined to make the most of the unexpected situation she now finds herself in, Red's only hope lies in evading the law. Because of her immunity, she's been forced to live life on the run. Granted, doing so goes against everything she's ever known, but if she's to survive, it's the only thing she's got going for her. Until she meets a bounty hunter named Trace. It's then everything changes.Forced to confront the secrets of her past, she and Trace traipse over the countryside in the hopes of finding a more peaceful life. Granted, they can't outrun the zombies. Nor can they outrun those who are still seeking Red's whereabouts. Never-the-less, they're determined in finding their own piece of heaven amidst all the chaos.As things between them change, the pair soon realizes that the zombies are here to stay. Either they conform to how things are now, or suffer the consequences of the unexpected tragedies that befall them at every turn. Co-existing seems like the most obvious choice, most especially when it comes to giving others a helping hand a long the way.Despite the hassles they encounter, here and there, there's one thing both are sure of. No matter who you meet, or what you do, survival is a must. There's always strength in numbers. Somehow, some way, the zombies will be vanquished. Sacrifices will be made in order to achieve that. It's a lesson Red and the rest of her family will learn well every step of the way.From the moment I first read Wanted: Dead or Undead by Angela Scott, I became hooked to this series. Angela has a way of telling such a vivid story that you find yourself imagining what it's like to live in such a chaotic time. Granted, this is an alternate version of the Wild West, but it does pose the question - what if things actually happened this way back then? Would life change as we know it? Would we survive as Red, Trace, and the rest of their family have? What would we become?This is one series I truly recommend. It's sure to capture your hearts and minds, making you want to read more and more of these beloved characters. I hope that some day we'll get to see more of Red and Trace. We can hope, right?

That being explained up front, this series is totally awesome. Book one of Zombie West, Wanted: Dead or Undead, totally hooked me in with the character, Red, a strong, independent girl-woman who loses her family to the plague which turns people to zombies after a single bite. The rest of the series builds a picture of a world where every person is suspect and their motives questioned. Trust is hard to earn and hard to give, especially because Red harbors a secret. A secret that may turn the tide on the zombie plague which has swept the country. Resources are scarce, and scavenging for meager supplies (bullets and clothing) and food, make people distrustful of new-comers. As she travels, Red slowly builds a new family of other survivors, finding strength in numbers. I like the twists in the plot, as well as the author's world building. There is a sadness to the greediness of people who need to take care of their own communities, shunning outsiders as another mouth to feed, and cutting into their supplies. There is no such thing as charity anymore, only barter. Another element to the story is Red\u2019s uniqueness, which makes her a target of people that see her as a possible way to end the madness, and find a cure. This sets up some philosophical questions: a) Is it right to kill the living and healthy, in an effort to cure the dead/zombies? b) Is it right to capture, contain, and experiment on one person for the possible (note: possible) chance of a cure? There are some who believe Red holds the secret of the cure in her blood, and they will stop at nothing to capture her for their experiments.Angela Scott has a great writing style, so I found the story engaging, completely overlooking by bias against zombies and the dreaded western. The Omnibus also included extra chapters and misc. info that adds to the reading experience.Great ending to an excellent series!"}, {"userName": "Roxanne Kade", "userReviewDate": "Jan 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5948499-roxanne-kade", "userReview": "I was extremely intrigued by this trilogy\u2026The Wild West and Zombies??\u2026hmmm, a combination that was sure to keep me entertained for hours, and it certainly did just that. But this series was not only about the undead. It was more a story of courage and sacrifice, as an unlikely mix of people band together to survive against all the elements; natural and supernatural. At times the pacing was a little slow and I would have liked to see more action and interaction with the Zombies, but this book was still exciting enough, with quite a few surprise plot twists, that I was enthralled from start to finish. Red\u2019s story was most peculiar. The minute she walked into Trace\u2019s life I was drawn to her and I had to know more about her. Why was she \u201cWanted\u201d? Why was she travelling alone? And what in her past had made her such a fierce, feisty character, one who didn\u2019t trust very easily? As the story progressed, so the many questions surrounding her increased; she was an enigma. This book was filled with adventure, action, tragedy and heartache, but it also held a lot of hope, courage and uncharacteristic romance.

The story centers on her and an amazing ability she has but it is also a love story between the two. That's about as much of a spoiler as you are going to get.

It could have been a hot mess, instead it was a very gripping read and I was sorry to come to the end... With an interesting story line, compelling characters and suspenseful writing - the author has been faithful to both the zombie genre and the Western genre. Zombie novels written by women tend to focus more on characterisation than gore, but sometimes they can go overboard by focusing too much on romantic relationships. Scott is able to balance the necessary gore with good characterisation and just enough focus on relationship to make the reader character about the characters without making it soapy.
