I found this book intriguing in the beginning and action-packed at the end, but the middle really dragged. I love great world-building. The concept of this book provided the opportunity for a rich world. While Jack and Lia's home community was nicely developed, the remainder of the world was almost too developed. At times it felt as though I were being beaten over the head with so many tedious details.Ultimately, though, I enjoyed Alexandria. The story was intriguing and the plot was satisfying."}, {"userName": "Cheryl", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5470988-cheryl", "userReview": "Alexandria by John Kaden is a beautifully written, enchanting, satisfying, and exceptional post-apocalyptic story. The tale revolves around Jack and Lia, two children who are kidnapped by a supposedly superior society. They are offered comfort, conveniences, and sanctuary if they will just accept the dystopian views of their kidnappers. This is a tough choice to make in a post-apocalyptic America, where most societies are tribal and primitive. Jack and Lia eventually run away in search of a mythical advanced society called Alexandria, and a big part of the story involves their road trip along the California coast in search of Alexandria. This story completely captivated me, to the point that I stayed up all night reading, and immediately looked for more books by Mr Kaden. I learned that this is his first book, which makes it that much more impressive. Jack and Lia live in a beautifully imagined and described world. It is completely authentic and fascinating. I want to read more about it. Jack and Lia carry the story; their relationship is strong and, again, beautifully described and written. Their love is woven throughout the story, but it never dominates or becomes a romantic novel...they just have a solid childhood friendship which becomes solid love and commitment over time. Their love carries them through the bleak events in their lives, and their long, arduous road trip. While the story is about Jack and Lia and the quest for Alexandria, there are many other layers -- supporting characters are vividly illustrated, complex, and interesting. The post-apocalyptic world itself is another well written layer of the story. And finally, the moral questions that are posed by the many characters and the dystopian society are also a fascinating (but never dominating or preachy) aspect to the story. All in all, an extremely satisfying, immersive, and beautifully written story set in a gorgeously conceived post-apocalyptic world. I am cheering Mr Kaden on for another book! Please keep writing. And quickly!"}, {"userName": "Maura", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23096635-maura", "userReview": "[ At first I thought it might be about letting go of the past and letting things unfold naturally, but then the knowledge was saved in the end and there was Alexandria's sister.

On the so called attackers gives them assistance to escape, put is horrendously tortured to find out where Jack and Lia have gone.On the run from the young adults not only have to navigate their way through an alien and hostile environment, but have to follow the vague directions given to find the answer to all their questions. All of which has to be done whilst avoiding vicious foes and the Nezran Scouts out to kill them.It was wonderfully paced, with nice twists, turns and glimpses of kindness and humanitarianism.There was a downside though, and that was the cliff-hanging ending. I've just checked John Kaden's blog on GoodReads, and he announced in September 2013 that there will be a sequel eventually, so fingers crossed it won't take too long - this could definitely turn into a saga of epic proportions.I thoroughly enjoyed reading of their travails, awarding 4 Stars. If I'd had the ability to give half star ratings, there is not doubt it would have been 4.5. Why not 5? Well, there were a few errors/bug bears that kept it off the top spot - please see the fuller Blog Post #409 in January 2014.Can I just say that the cover artwork was stunning, and really says so much about the world that Jack and Lia inhabit. Kudos to the author for choosing it."}, {"userName": "Rexine", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7882754-rexine", "userReview": "I can't say I loved this book, but I didn't hate it. It had potential but sadly it was slow until the end and then after the action took place, it was over. Its the 24th century and the earth was destroyed 200yrs earlier by fire. The story follows jack and Lia, pre-teens and sweethearts who, along with others their age are suddenly left as orphans when a tribe kills all the teens and parents and steals the children. The Nezra, a temple of people follow a false king, who apparently has power to prevent the fires from ever reoccurring. The Nezra, a seemingly peaceful people believe outer tribes will bring the wrath of fire back upon he earth, so they steal the children and brainwash them, integrating them into their society. Years later, Jack and lia, undeceived, escape to find out what really happened to the earth and discover the truth about this king. It's a perilous and SLOW journey. I wanted to find out what would happen to jack and lia but it was so slow I gave up caring and just read to get to the end. The writing is graphic and leaves you right inside this new and young civilisation, but little is divulged as to what causes the destruction of the former civilisation (we can assume nuclear war, followed by famine and plagues). Heroes are left wanting and the love between jack and lia is weak.I recommend it if you like books detailing new civilisations climbing out of disaster, but not if you want an action packed read. Yawn!"}, {"userName": "Faye ", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5276203-faye", "userReview": "What a brilliant book. Set sometime in our worlds future, a great apocalypse has befallen Earth and the remnants of the population in part, live as people once did in the New World before the conquistadores arrived or as cannibalistic savages or still have use of tech. The story starts in a forest village during a celebration of all things that came to pass. The village is attacked and the children carried off to a distant land to be broken down and reformed in the new way of life under an Aztec like King. The story follows two main characters, Jack and Lia as they grow up and try to integrate into this new society. Things come to a head and they end up on the run into the wilderness chased by the Sons of the Temple. Along the way they meet various groups of people and finally we discover the secret of 'Alexandria'.... This is a really good example of a classic PA with shades of Logan's Run, Planet of the Apes ( without the apes) and quite a few other PA books and films. This is why I love this genre, can highly recommend it !"}, {"userName": "Rosemary", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17065900-rosemary", "userReview": "This is a truly fantastic book. It tells the story of two children who are abducted, along with the rest of the children in their village, when their parents were all murdered. It is about their struggle to survive the ensuing years and how they eventually escape, and then make their way back again to help bring an end to the cult, and their king, who had them kidnapped in the first place.It is not a book filled with mind numbing suspense with twists and turns on every page, but rather it is a beautifully written book with its fair share of suspense, cruelty and murder, but it is interspersed with kindness and adventure, as well as great descriptions of every-day life in a world that no longer bears any resemblance to the world we know today. The descriptions of the landscape and what it looks like hundreds of years after the fall of society is great, and it makes me wish this was a picture book, just to see it all for myself, through the eyes of the author.It is a great book \u2013 I loved it."}, {"userName": "Bob", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2401232-bob", "userReview": "This is a post apocalypse tale sent several centuries after the fall of our present civilization. A small settlement of hunters and small farmers is living in the redwood forest of what was California. It\u2019s a fairly primitive village, but the inhabitants are comfortable and celebrating one of their \u201cholidays\u201d when they are attacked in the night by a band of marauders. The adults are all killed and the village torched. The children are placed in cages and carried by the marauders north wards to their settlement. This settlement is more advanced and presided over by a \u201cKing\u201d whose soldiers make periodic forays to capture children and destroy their villages. The children are then put to work and integrated into the population. This is the tale of a boy and girl, best friends when they were captured, and their life and eventual escape from the \u201cTemple\u201d as the settlement is called.

This was a new author for me and the book was another Kindle freebie. Was a pretty good read, the characters were well developed and weren't lacking. The story was very well told and didn't lag or get lost in itself. Jack and Lia are both strong young characters that go through a lot from the start.this is a good entertaining story, but it is not a quick read. While the story and the characters kept my attention, it seemed, heavy for lack of a better word. I never got bored with it, and never did I think come on and get to the point, but it just seemed like the more I read the further I still had to go. Please don't pay attention to my read dates on this book, I got up to about 65 pages from the end sound April 10th and then life got in the way. I just picked the book back up today and finished it."}, {"userName": "Tamara", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3093830-tamara", "userReview": "This is a good book if you enjoy post apocalyptic world stories.

It relays the tale of the rise of civilization after two centuries of darkness as seen through the eyes of a young man (Jack) and young woman (Lia) - who happen to be childhood sweethearts. The story hits many high points: how men can become deluded into believing in their own power, how children can be integrated into a society that destroyed the society of their parents, and how Humanity's thirst for safety often allows room for the doing of despicable deeds. The culminating plot device - Jack and Lia's journey to find the fabled city of Alexandria - drives the second half of the book, and culminates in a satisfying conclusion. A good (apparently) stand-alone read for lovers of the post-apocalyptic genre!"}, {"userName": "Kerie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5854091-kerie", "userReview": "An enjoyable read, if you aren't bothered by typos and strange use of some words. It was more realistic than some of the post apocalypse stuff I've read. I'm still waiting on someone to write a novel where the protagonists aren't looking to rebuild the monster that is civilization, and create something new. Maybe it's too hard to envision something new. Though this story is also realistic in that in the event that there was some kind of devastation the vast majority of survivors would be pining for the good old days when they were oppressed in ways they never even realized, and trying to rebuild it."}, {"userName": "Sandy", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7255103-sandy", "userReview": "I liked this book. I got it as a free ebook on Amazon. The author did a nice job building this world and developing the main characters. I would have liked the middle journey developed a little more, perhaps more clues as to where they were as the story went along would have helped in the visualization. I also wanted more info about what had happened to create this world they were living in. I'll likely recommend this book to my kids when they are a bit older. It was a fairly quick read and I am placing it in the reread someday pile.

The descriptives in this book were so well done. You could imagine the scenery and feel like you were on the battle grounds. Each word the author wrote left you eager to read the next.
