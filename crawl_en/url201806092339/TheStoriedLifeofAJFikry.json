We read because we are alone. We read and we are not alone. We are not alone.Once in a while a book comes along that captures your heart and soul- where the characters become like friends and family, and a part of you wants to pack a bag and travel to that magical place forever. At the start you just know it is going to be something special- by the end you feel physical pain knowing that these people are gone from your life...One day you may pick it back up to read again - but you know it will never be the same as that first experience. THE STORIED LIFE OF A.J. FIKRY made me smile, laugh out loud, cry uncontrollably...and my grinchy heart might have even grown three sizes. 39 year-old A.J. Fikry is the owner of a failing bookstore -Island Books- on Alice Island- it should be successful- being the only bookstore in the area and because of A.J.'s passion for books...but A.J. doesn't like people very much. His wife- Nic- was the people person, the one that kept the bookstore running, the love of his life- and now she is dead- killed in a car accident a year and a half ago......For the last year and a half A.J. has been barely getting by- he drinks too much, lives on frozen dinners, has stopped exercising, pushes people away, and is even grumpy to his staff and customers...but at least he has a plan- Sell the bookstore and auction off his copy of Tamerlane. An extremely rare collection of poems by Edgar Allan Poe- worth 400 thousand dollars. Then he can retire. But fate steps in and throws another gut-wrenching blow at Mr. Fikry- when the uninsured Tamerlane is stolen right out of his home during a night of binge drinking. It is the first wake up call A.J gets. The second is only weeks away...I will leave my review right there- because I think part of loving this book came from knowing practically nothing about it. It was full of so many little and BIG surprises along the way and I am soooooo glad I went against my first instinct of passing this one by. THE STORIED LIFE OF A.J. FIKRY is a story of love, loss, and second chances.

That's basically the highest compliment I can give...\n...and I am truly glad that it didn't took me so long to read it!!!\nThe words you can't find, you borrow...\n Maybe I could find the words but honestly, that first quote from this wonderful book was the right way to compliment it. And to do that, well I quote a second one too. And you will find several quotes in this review since honestly, this is one of the most quotable novels that I ever read. And believe it or not, they won't be all the quotes that I loved here.I LOVE THIS BOOK AND IT'S ONE OF THE BEST NOVELS THAT I EVER READ!And that it isn't a quote! That's my honest thinking about it!I have read several positive reviews about the novel and I was expecting a good book, but I never expected that it will be SOOOOOO good and a truly wonderful reading experience!This is a book about books. I mean, this story is about novels, novellas, short stories, readers, writers, bookstores... so indeed I think that this a \"must-read\" to every person with passion for reading and love for books.The style of the novel is quite particular since it's without a question a novel per se but each chapter is constructed as a kinda self-contained short story but all of them are one big storyline. And a priceless detail is that each chapter is titled for some famous short story written by some other author in the past and that it's related in some way to something on the chapter.A good book has characters with evolution and due that... this is an exceptional book! Since the evolution of each character is truly remarkable and taking unsuspected paths but all of them interconnected in such wonderful way. Even characters that you don't expect much at first, they will surprise you totally.\nA place isn't a place until it has a bookstore.\nI love Alice Island! I didn't want to reseach if Alice Island was a real place or not until finishing the book and the author explained that it was an invented place. Maybe it will sound odd, but I love that it is a fictional place. Since from the beginning I was playing the idea of that the place got its name from the Alice from Wonderland, that it's one of my favorite fairy tales, and while that wasn't confirmed on the novel, there was a reference to the tale, so there is hope...\n...the necessity of encountering stories at precisely the right time in our lives.\nDefinitely, I want to believe that about this wonderful book, while it was published until this year (2014), so I wouldn't be able to read it before, still, it was the right time for me, since it would be very likely that even two years ago, I wouldn't be able to appreciate it in the same way.\n...the things we respond to at twenty are not necessarily the same things we will respond to at forty and vice versa. This is true in books and also in life.\nDefinitely, we aren't the same people twice, each year we change for better or worse and that's why that you also never read the same book twice, maybe the first time you hate it and twenty years later you got amazed for the same novel. Experiences in life define how we perceive the following things on it.\n...forcing kids to read books like that that make them think they hate reading.\nNever force a book to a kid, even if you think that you are doing them a favor. That's why usually kids and even more teenagers hate to read the assigned books in schools. Let them find their genres, let them find their kind of books. Everybody is a reader, only some of them are still looking for the right book.\n...the easiest way to get old is to be technologically behind.\nDon't fight between paper books and e-readers. I love my printed books but now I am used to read several stuff on my tablet. For me, the important thing is to read, not matter in which way, but to read. Any book in any way. Just read.\nMost people's problems would be solved if they would only give more things a chance.\nSo, let's give it a chance to this novel! Maybe your problem won't be solved reading this book, but certainly it will put your soul at peace and with that, being able to find a solution.\nP.S.\nI am accountant but luckily the book that impacted me most in my life wasn't... Principles of Accounting, Part II !!! Not even close! Hahaha!\nP.P.S.\nSiberian huskies in Arizona?!! Only me found that odd? Hehehe!\nP.P.P.S.\nThe old kind cops rule!

I'm not even a fan of Zevin's work; I quite liked the concept behind Elsewhere but not the execution, and I pretty much hated All These Things I've Done. But this book is just so warm and funny and bittersweet. It speaks to the thing inside me that has always loved books, will always love books, and has allowed my life to be swept in certain directions by my love for literature.A.J. Fikry is one of my favourite kinds of characters - he's cynical and grumpy, but simultaneously witty, clever, funny and lovable. This is essentially the tale of his life after the death of his beloved wife. He must somehow pick up the pieces of his world and continue managing his bookstore, while all he really wants to do is drink away his problems.One day, A.J. receives an unexpected package that is guaranteed to completely change his life. Like many great books, his life twists in a strange new direction, introducing him to new people and new ways of thinking. He soon begins to realise that he still has many things worth living for.Woven with allusions to many works of literature - especially short stories - this novel should resonate with many book lovers. Those of us who have been truly affected, influenced, changed or - dare I be so melodramatic - even saved by them. I don't know if Zevin intended to make a point about the death of the bookstore and physical books in favour of ereaders, but I found myself feeling a little melancholy as time went by and more people stopped buying physical books. Though ultimately relieved, as I realised how important bookstores and paper books still are to many people.Whether this book is for you or not, I cannot say. It is both funny and serious, happy and sad, light and dark... but I wouldn't have it any other way."}, {"userName": "karen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45618-karen", "userReview": "A town isn't a town without a bookstore.while it's true that this is the literary equivalent of a stone skipped over a pond, it's a pretty damn charming stone. reading about other booknerds, even when they are better described as bookcranks, is delightful to me. A Novel Bookstore, Salamander, Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore, etc are among my favorite books. are they the best books ever written? nah. but they have characters whose sensibilities are so close to my own, it's hard not to feel a little heartswell when you encounter them. because if you're on goodreads at all, you know that books matter. whether you read the kinds of vampire books that fikry laments or the more serious tomes he applauds (although considering he esteems The Book Thief, hasn't finished proust's ISOLT, and dismisses Infinite Jest, i'm taking his purported book-snobbery with a grain of salt), you know the power of a good story, even when it's just a sweet little piece of light escapism.this is a love letter to booklovers about the power of the written word to bring people together whether the relationships be romantic, parental, or book-clubby.several of these relationships involve the titular a.j. fikry; a bookstore owner and widower living on a small island somewhere new england-y who finds himself entrusted with the care of a two-year-old named maya after she is abandoned in his bookstore. he's already old-man curmudgeonly although still in his thirties, but finds the raising of maya and instilling in her his own love of books to be one of those rewarding experiences that enriches one's life and is all sorts of inspirational. although he expresses it differently.Fucking love, he thinks. What a bother. It's completely gotten in the way of his plan to drink himself to death, to drive his business to ruin. The most annoying thing about it is that once a person gives a shit about one thing, he finds he has to start giving a shit about everything.and give a shit he does, as his love for maya allows him to nurture other feelings including reluctantly acknowledged romantic ones for a vibrant book-loving woman with her own relationship baggage. in a comment that sounds like something ripped right out of Madame Bovary,Her mother likes to say that novels have ruined Amelia for real men.thankfully for fikry, this is not true, because he is indeed a real, flawed man. but he's also the kind of man whose first-date chatter involves \"In what restaurant based on a novel would you have preferred to dine*?\"so he's got some good points. so it's a romance and a sort-of cozy mystery (although the theft of his copy of Tamerlane: Poem is not important to the story - until it is), and one of those cheeky feel-good smalltown books in which suicides both occur and are contemplated and people die and there are miscarriages and infidelity, but it's all glossed over in the same way as those other pesky realities like how an abandoned-child scenario would really be handled. because, no.so despite the supremely precocious maya and the novel's relentlessly cheerful tone, both of which i would ordinarily find irritating, i enjoyed the bookyness of it more than i was irritated by its greeting card outlook. all the discussions about the perils of e-books and chain bookstores (the only thing worse than a world with big chain bookstores was a world with NO big chain bookstores.),the methods of publishing reps, the assessment that blurbs are the blood diamonds of publishing, \"nerd\" as a term of endearment, all the meta stuff at the beginning \"if this were a book\u2026.\" - it's all stuff from \"my\" world, so it's easy to love. it's a very quick read about bookfolk that may not be the most cerebral thing on the shelves, but it's hard not to get caught up in its genuine enthusiasm and start nodding along nerdily at certain moments.it's summer- enjoy yourself.* my answer - James and the Giant Peach. with giant animatronic bugs, slightly scarier than the ones on the film, and a menu includingbaked peaches with ricotta and honeychicken with peach chutneypeach cobblerpeach crisppeach and pancetta pizzapeach souppeanut butter and bacon burger with peach chutneysalmon and peachesnow, if you will excuse me. all those peaches have made me feel daring."}, {"userName": "Kristin (KC) - Traveling Sister", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4971692-kristin-kc---traveling-sister", "userReview": "*4.5 Stars* \u2014 because how can any bonafide book-nerd not adore this quirky and heartfelt tribute to literature!I don\u2019t know about you, but I could dwell inside the richly entertaining mind of one \nA.J. Fickry\n forever. Or at least every other weekend. Because that\u2019s exactly what this novel simulates: a casual stroll through the mind of a complex, yet vastly simple middle-aged widower whose outlook on life has deflated.  Life has knocked him down, as it tends to do, and A.J. finds comfort in the cold embrace of pessimism and gloom\u2026And, of course, in his ownership of the town\u2019s one and only bookstore.But a mysterious \u201cpackage\u201d popping up in his store will spark a powerful change in A.J., and even the townspeople, who typically view him as a grouchy ol\u2019 book-snob will take notice. The heart of this story explores the process of grief and the regaining of hope\u2014but in a very gentle manner. The tragedies, although deep, are not pronounced within its writing. This plot mimics life in the way that it keeps moving forward. And despite the fact that its reader will likely be moved to tears, the next chapter follows, bringing with it the inevitable \u201cnew day\u201d whether you\u2019re ready for it or not. Along with the side-effects of heartache, this author infuses generous amounts humor, a wholesome romance, and a sprinkle of mystery within these pages. A.J.\u2019s selective taste for quality literature is endearing, and his judgments of the rest of the book world\u2014comical. I loved the various references to classics, and how each chapter begins with the mention of one\u2014A.J.\u2019s unique perspective included. He often views the people in his world as characters in a book, predicting their next move based off his astute knowledge of fictional-being-behavior. The more I think about it, the more this book just seems so incredibly simple, yet has hit me with such surprising force that I can still feel it buzzing. I\u2019ve claimed more times than I can count how I\u2019ll \u201cnever forget\u201d a book. But time passes, and only a select few truly stand out. I think this will be one of those few.

I\u2019d throw it across the room.\u201d\u201cYou know everything you need to know about a person from the answer to the question, what is your favorite book?\u201d\u201cSomeday, you may think of marrying. Pick someone who thinks you're the only person in the room.\u201d\u201cWe read to know we\u2019re not alone. We read because we are alone. We read and we are not alone.

I don't think it necessarily has to be literary, but the story is told in a completely shallow way and is spread unbelievably thin, which renders the message pretty meaningless. The author is trying so hard to be cute and clever, and I rolled my eyes over and over again because it all felt so calculated to be gobbled up by book lovers. I know she can write some really lovely things since some of the quotes from fictional books were wonderful. She would have made better use of her efforts to concentrate on that kind of writing style.

A must for book lovers and booksellers alike, The Storied Life of A.J. Fikry is an affirmation of the love of books and reading and how they meld lives together. A.J. Fikry, is the owner of the independent bookstore, Island Books. Fikry is grieving the loss of his wife, sales are down, a rare book worth scads of money is stolen from the shop leaving him irritable, and irritating. Frankly he's depressed and is turning more and more inward, cutting himself off more than the normal isolation of Alice Island living. Fate or something else entirely steps in when one night he finds a special package on his bookshop floor changing his life forever. Gabrielle Zevon treats us to some of the most likeable, memorable characters I've met in a long time. Though I adore them all, even cranky Fikry, my favorite is the cop, Lambiase, who in the line of duty must visit the store frequently and so buys books. Not wanting to waste his hard earned money, he reads the books and eventually leads the Chief's Choice Book Club. A question asked as part of A.J.F's reviews that head each chapter\"Is a twist less satisfying if you know it's coming?\"My answer, \"No A.J., No Gabrielle!\"If you've ever wondered about the inner workings of an independent bookstore or how it might feel to be a sales rep pitching a publisher's catalog, put this on your list. If you like a feel good, romantic story that will make you smile with a need for a few tissues, put this on your list. To give credit where credit is due, my sincere thanks to Michael Rockliff of Workman Publishing for his spirited recommendation of The Storied Life of A.J.

How am I supposed to get into the story when the author keeps jarring me away from it by talking about things like that man. Also for someone who makes a good chunk of the book be about what makes a book or story good, the author seems not to have developed the story she was writing that well. I don't think we needed to follow A.J. for so many years the way the story does and towards the end the story started to get kind of flat. I know the author was trying to be clever with the plot and usually I like when everything comes back full circle but I just don't think it worked here. The writing was good and the characters and premise interesting and I wish it had been written differently so we only got the story for those few days before he gets left with Maya or something.

It's not a heavy story, but it's just so phenomenally done. It reads with the simplicity of a short story but still carries its own weight throughout the progression of the entire lifetime of its characters.

I do enjoy my e-reader, but still love my real books more.)"}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3191832-lisa", "userReview": "[ I really tried to like this book, but I did not like this book. I found the writing to be overly cutesy and I really don't dig that at all. In fact, truth be told, I thought the writing was pretty bad. Here's a great example of a part that I strongly disliked because of its cutesy-ness: \"The second week of August, just before Maya starts kindergarten, she gets a matching set of glasses (round, red frames) and chicken pox (round, red bumps). A.J. curses the mother who had told him that the chicken pox vaccine was optional as the chicken pox is indeed a pox on their house\".This is such a fantastic example of a style of writing that I really, really dislike. It has the feeling of trying entirely too hard. At this point I found it hard to go any further. I did though, but it was a push. I also found the whole book to be incredibly gimmicky. It felt to me like the sole purpose of writing this story was to have a vehicle that could carry all the book-lovers' jargon and literary references. I also disliked the tense the book was set in; I felt like by writing it in this way, it was reaching to be quirky and original. I really found the whole book to be a big reach to be quirky. It just didn't work at all for me. I'm pretty surprised that this book became a roaring hit. I know that a lot of my really good friends loved this book tremendously and recommended it to me, so I wanted to love it too. I always feel terribly bad when I dislike a book that profoundly touches another person that I care about. It just doesn't feel good. It makes me want to apologize! But I just can't pretend to like this book, even a little bit, because I felt like it was so poorly written and like I said already, gimmicky to the max. Also, it seems to be marked as a book that 'real' readers are going to rejoice over. To me that seems like a dirty sales trick: the literary equivalent of 'if you really loved me you'd do whatever'. Really, in my opinion, this is a rather poorly written book without much substance. I feel like the author is laughing all the way to the bank on this one. But my friends love it, and they are really smart and clever, much more so than me, so take all this with a grain of salt. But there you have it. Thanks in advance for not shunning me :)  (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "A friend\u2019s 7-year-old daughter once told her, \u201cMom, you need a trip to paradise.\u201d I wish my kid had said it to me, but never mind. I\u2019m taking it to mean, \u201cMom, you and Debbie need a trip to paradise.\u201d Well, holy shit, I found it! Island Books, the setting for this book, is located smack in the middle of paradise.I purposely didn\u2019t read any reviews before diving in, and I\u2019m glad. Strange and wonderful things start happening right from the beginning, and I\u2019m caught off guard and delighted. I thought, oh this is a great author\u2014she knows how to keep the action going lickety-split, and she knows that it works to throw in things that are unexpected. I\u2019ll avoid talking about the actual plot line in the hope that you get the same element of surprise that I did. I\u2019ll only say it\u2019s about a guy who owns a bookstore. If you can, try to avoid reviews that summarize what happens.I didn\u2019t want it to be over. Okay, it\u2019s cool enough that the book is about a bookstore, but there are tons of other book goodies. First and foremost, you get to hang out with a bunch of other book nuts. That\u2019s cathartic in itself. And there are, naturally, book recommendations that make you want a grab a pencil and write them down. But that\u2019s just the tip of the iceberg. Want to read a kid\u2019s short story? And attend the short story competition? Want to go to an exciting and bizarre author signing? Want to live above a bookstore? Want to join a book club? Want a few nuggets on writing? But wait, there\u2019s more. There\u2019s a book theft. There\u2019s a publishing company rep pushing titles. And every chapter opens with a reference to a literary work, followed by tender and thoughtful comments about it.It\u2019s like the author said to herself, hm\u2026.what would a book lover salivate over? And she nails it. Think about every permutation of book lust, and it\u2019s here. It\u2019s like crack to all us book addicts. And what a fix we get!I wasn\u2019t sure going into this one. Will the tone be lecture-y? Will the book titles be esoteric? The answer to both better be no, or I\u2019ll be annoyed big time\u2014though in fact my bristly annoyance would simply be covering up my insecurity about being unread and stupid.I needn\u2019t have worried. I knew some of the titles, but not all, but I never felt like I was in trouble for not recognizing some of them. Besides, when I go to a bookstore, I\u2019m not going to recognize all the titles, or kick myself for not knowing them. And the author is gentle about it\u2014she creates a main character who is realistic and kind; who talks about books in a way that\u2019s inviting and playful, not arrogant or pedantic. Because his livelihood depends on his selling books, and because he\u2019s basically a nice guy, he\u2019s never condescending to his buyers. He wants to sell books, yes, but he also wants to share his book lust and help people find nirvana through books.This genius author makes sure the book talk never overpowers the plot; it only enhances it. And there is so much more here. There are a couple of juicy mysteries, and I didn\u2019t have a clue how they\u2019d be solved\u2014but they are wrapped up nicely. There\u2019s humor, romance, pathos, suspense, and a lot of \u201cfeel good\u201d (without being all Hallmarky). The characters are engaging: well-drawn, complex, quirky, and sympathetic. The author weaves a really good yarn that flows at a great pace; there are no side trips down the alleys of philosophy or history.As an ex-editor, I found a couple of minute logistical issues\u2014probably too small to even mention, but with my editor OCD, I must. (Help me stop doing this, please!) The funniest instance was when the main character went to a bar in his underwear and bathrobe\u2014the author just forgot to somehow get him back home so he could get dressed before heading to the bar.And one more thing, which is not so minute, but which I didn\u2019t care about because I was so sold on this book already: The young kid speaks like an adult. And it was so disconcerting, I repeatedly tried to pinpoint her age, which really was unnecessary and distracting. She is supposed to be precocious, but still--it seemed like she was a toddler with the vocabulary and sentence structure of a 20-year-old. But like I said, I didn\u2019t care. I was a goner as soon as I read the first chapter.Okay, one final, teensy weensy, unimportant nit: What\u2019s with the name Fikry?? It\u2019s so hard to remember, let alone pronounce! My brain and mouth stumble. Is it Firkry or Frikry or Friky or what? Oh, okay, look up the title for the eighty gazillionth time. Oh, it\u2019s FIKRY\u2014I think. I sort of stutter when I recommend this title to someone, and I lose a little of my umph. And I need all my umph so I can sell it.I get upset that people say this is a good beach read, or that it\u2019s light and breezy. If a book moves along at a good pace, has an interesting plot, has somewhat happy characters, has no philosophical side roads, and is under 400 pages, is it classified as light? I don\u2019t think that\u2019s fair. This book has depth and wisdom. In my opinion, it\u2019s top-notch literary fiction.An added perk for me: I lived on Cape Cod for five years, and my husband worked on the ferry boats running to Hyannis. This book takes place on a fictional island near Hyannis and revolves around the fictional Island Books. I visited the islands many times and stopped in at bookstores that were a lot like Island Books, complete with wonderful owners who went out of their way to find the perfect book for me. Fond memories.I don\u2019t allow myself to reread books, since I have too many new ones in my queue. But for this fantastic book, I might make an exception. Speaking of my book queue, I\u2019d like to read Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Bookstore soon for comparison, though I know The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry is going to be one hard act to follow.My friend\u2019s daughter would be happy: I did go to paradise and I LOVED it.

Fikry\nI stayed up late last night to finish this book, and hoped that by the time I woke up this morning, I'd have a clear idea about why and what I loved most about this book. I'm still at a loss for words because I love every single part of this book! Fittingly, it was recommended by the owner of a tiny independent bookstore in my neighborhood, one of the few of its kind left in Dallas. I didn't read the synopsis, and I tried to avoid reviews that mentioned particulars about plot. I wanted to be thoroughly surpised and amazed, just like readers of long ago, who'd ask for a copy of their favorite author's next book to be set aside at their local bookstore as soon as it arrived\u2013days before dustjackets, ereaders, and internet pop-up ads. Blind faith can move you to take good risks.\n\"Why is any one book different from any other book? They are different, A.J. decides, because they are. We have to look inside many. We have to believe. We agree to be disappointed sometimes so that we can be exhilarated every now and again.\"\nWell, that's it really. I loved this book because it was exhilarating. It was a book about books and people who love them\u2013people of all shapes, colors and sizes. It also encompassed my ideas of hope, love, family, grief, and reality, really. A book that makes you laugh heartily, sniffle into your coffee, and reread the acknowledgement page, must be a book of upstanding character. I applaude you, Gabrielle Zevin.

J. Fikry\u00a0was the most fun I had reading a fiction book since the start of this year. What compelled me to give it a go was seeing this next quote shared online:\u201cPeople tell boring lies about politics, God, and love. You know everything you need to know about a person from the answer to the question, What is your favorite book?\u201dAnd I\u2019m forevermore grateful because what followed was something I couldn\u2019t have possibly foreseen: I laughed, teared up, cackled, and\u00a0became super invested in\u00a0the lives of this\u00a0incredible cast of characters, both supporting and leading, from Alice Island. The blurb does an excellent job of capturing their defining moments:A. J. Fikry\u2019s life is not at all what he expected it to be. His wife has died, his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history, and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Slowly but surely, he is isolating himself from all the people of Alice Island\u2014from Lambiase, the well-intentioned police officer who\u2019s always felt kindly toward Fikry; from Ismay, his sister-in-law who is hell-bent on saving him from his dreary self; from Amelia, the lovely and idealistic (if eccentric) Knightley Press sales rep who keeps on taking the ferry over to Alice Island, refusing to be deterred by A.J.\u2019s bad attitude. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, A.J. can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly.And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It\u2019s a small package, but large in weight. It\u2019s that unexpected arrival that gives A. J. Fikry the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn\u2019t take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming A.J.; or for that determined sales rep, Amelia, to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light; or for the wisdom of all those books to become again the lifeblood of A.J.\u2019s world; or for everything to twist again into a version of his life that he didn\u2019t see coming. As surprising as it is moving,\u00a0The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry\u00a0is an unforgettable tale of transformation and second chances, an irresistible affirmation of why we read, and why we love.As I mentioned at the start of this review, I was drawn to\u00a0the beginning of this book, thanks to\u00a0the numerous laugh-out-loud moments where\u00a0the main character keeps breaking the fourth wall left and right.\u201cMy wife and I,\u201d A.J. replied without thinking. \u201cOh Christ, I just did that stupid thing where the character forgets that the spouse has died and he accidentally uses \u2018we.\u2019 That\u2019s such a clich\u00e9. Officer\u201d\u2014he paused to read the cop\u2019s badge\u2014\u201cLambiase, you and I are characters in a bad novel. Do you know that? How the heck did we end up here? You\u2019re probably thinking to yourself,\u00a0Poor bastard, and tonight you\u2019ll hug your kids extra tight because that\u2019s what characters in these kinds of novels do. You know the kind of book I\u2019m talking about, right? The kind of hotshot literary fiction that, like, follows some unimportant supporting character for a bit so it looks all Faulkneresque and expansive. Look how the author cares for the little people! The common man! How broad-minded he or she must be! Even your name. Officer Lambiase is the perfect name for a clich\u00e9d Massachusetts cop. Are you racist, Lambiase? Because your kind of character ought to be racist.\u201dThis\u00a0made me throw my head back with laughter. INCREDIBLE.I went into this book so hesitant because\u00a0I thought it would read exactly like what the author was\u00a0making fun of in the above paragraph... But needless to say, I was more than misled. The last\u00a0time I felt\u00a0this same amount of surprise was when I finally caved in to\u00a0watch the film Deadpool (which is the last thing I thought I\u2019d be comparing this book with) and was utterly blown away with its crass and precise humor. (Here are some of my favorite 4th wall breaks from the movie.) And the same type\u00a0of wit is used by our main character, the snarky and grumpy\u00a0A.J. Fikry.Aside from appreciating\u00a0the more comical moments, I also enjoyed\u00a0Gabrielle Zevin's swift novel for making\u00a0each chapter feel like a short story. Similar to how the Netflix tv series,\u00a0Master of None uses each episode to explore a different theme (which I\u2019ll talk about extensively in my May Wrap Up), this book\u00a0dived into the notions of fatherhood, grief, love, friendship, book people, and so much more.Plus,\u00a0A.J. Fikry's\u00a0short\u00a0reviews to his \u201cdear little nerds\u201d\u00a0interspersed at\u00a0the start of every new chapter made\u00a0reading the book that more enjoyable. A.J. always had something noteworthy written\u00a0down\u00a0that would make me think for days to come.\u201cMy life is in these books, he wants to tell her. Read these and know my heart.\u201dThis\u00a0standout of a novel was full of eclectic, charming,\u00a0mismatched characters with\u00a0the addition of memorable quotes\u00a0to ponder (I nearly\u00a0underlined every other line), and twists and turns at each corner, promising to\u00a0really do\u00a0a number on your mind.\u00a0But at the heart of it all, there's\u00a0a quiet allure to this world\u00a0Zevin created that held\u00a0me glued to the pages, completely rapt,\u00a0till I reached that dreaded last page. And\u00a0to conclude, reading about these lovely nerds, who perfectly\u00a0get\u00a0my love for reading, was a comfort for my soul. I feel like this next quote sums up my chance encounter with this read pretty well:\u00a0\u201cthe necessity of encountering stories at precisely the right time in our lives.\u201d\u00a0I\u2019m beyond grateful\u00a0that I had\u00a0the joy to discover\u00a0The Storied Life of A.

Still, I loved how a lonely curmudgeon using books to escape life gets turned around to using them to connect to people. A.J. Fikry seems to have painted his life into a corner, running a bookstore on a fictional island off Cape Cod. Someone leaves an infant girl, Maya, in his store, and she melts his cold heart.  A.J. watches Maya in her pink party dress, and he feels a vaguely familiar, slightly intolerable bubbling inside of him. He wants to laugh out loud or punch a wall. He feels drunk or at least carbonated. Insane. At first, he thinks this is happiness, but then he determines it\u2019s love. Fucking love, he thinks. What a bother. It\u2019s completely gotten in the way of his plan to drink himself to death, or drive his business to ruin. The most annoying thing about it is that once a person gives a shit about one thing, he finds he has to start giving a shit about everything.Like ripples in a pond, A.J.\u2019s transformations begin to bring in a larger circle. His one friend, Daniel, a self-centered, philandering novelist, begins to be humanized through contact with Maya, starting with reading to her. A deputy sheriff, Lambiase, becomes a friend over the Maya case and soon becomes a book lover who starts a crime fiction reading group at the store. A single book dealer, Amelia, from Rhode Island is frustrated in trying to find A.J.\u2019s taste in books to sell to him better, and she begins to have better luck connecting with him after Maya comes on the scene. What story can they create together? The play on the metaphors and intersections of books with life is fun and inspiring at times. Here is a great example in a situation where Daniel is flirting with a woman at a social gathering: \u201cI bet you\u2019re a good editor,\u201d he says. \u2026 Janine looks at her watch.\u201cJanine looks at her watch,\u201d Daniel says. \u201cShe is bored with the old writer.\u201dJanine smiles. \u201cStrike the second sentence.

The best ones at least. Novels aren\u2019t meant to be imitation screenplays.\u201dThere are enough surprising twists and quirky interactions among the characters to keep readers on their toes. The book has some of the same charm as Bennett\u2019s \u201cThe Uncommon Reader\u201d and trajectory of personal mission like in \u201cThe Unlikely Pilgrimmage of Harold Fry\u201d.

This story is poignant and bittersweet, but is also charming, touching and heartwarming. It\u2019s a reader\u2019s paradise and will soothe the brow of any book nerd who can\u2019t help but feel a strong kinship with the characters, and maybe even recognize yourself in them just a little bit. A.J. owns and operates the independent books store, \u201cIsland Books\u201d, located on Alice Island, Massachusetts, alone after his wife is killed in a car accident. As he stumbles through each day in a fog of bitter grief, a series of events snaps him to attention and his life takes on a new direction, one he never could have imagined. The first part of the book kept me in stitches. I\u2019ve known literary snobs, and A.J. is one. I laughed out loud at his aversion to stocking Young Adult and children's books, and his opinion on series, and vampires. Then we got to the part where A.J. deals with customers and if you have worked in a bookstore or library you\u2019ll relate, and again I\u2019m laughing hysterically. \u201cWhy is any one book different from any other book? They are different, A.J. decides, because they are. We have to look inside many. We have to believe. We agree to be disappointed sometimes so that we can be exhilarated every now and again.\u201dBut, A.J.\u2019s persnickety personality is soon softened by a very special surprise delivery to his shop, which gives him a new perspective on life and relationships, including one with the book sales representative, Amelia, who warms up to A.J. after getting off to a pretty rough start, and the local chief of police who becomes one of his best friends. The story is like an homage to book lovers, reading, and the way books shape us and the impact they can have on our outlook on life, even in our relationships, our attitudes, and how they can inspire us through good and bad times. I loved A.J. right from the start. I understood where he was in life at that very moment, and while I snickered at his drollness, his deadpan introverted nature, my heart broke for him.It was an honor to watch him come back to life and embrace it with as much gusto has he could muster. Seeing his life enriched in such an amazing way was only part of the story. A.J. and his little bookstore also touched and enriched other\u2019s lives all of them had a life much better than the one they would have had without him. He built an important legacy over the years, and that legacy, thanks to those he loved, will go on to extend the love of books and reading to people for a long time to come\u2026 even to those who love vampires, series, Young Adult, and Children\u2019s books about orphans.This a delightful story that lifted my spirits and warmed my heart. 5 stars"}, {"userName": "Helene Jeppesen", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21992464-helene-jeppesen", "userReview": "This is one of those books that have been getting so much hype that you start wondering whether you're going to like it yourself.

And I loved it!I believe I was bewitched early in the book when Fikry delivers a world class book rant:\nI do not like postmodernism, postapocalyptic settings, postmortem narrators, or magical realism. I rarely respond to supposedly clever formal devices, multiple fonts, pictures where they shouldn't be -- basically gimmicks of any kind. I find literary fiction about the Holocaust or any other major world tragedy to be distasteful -- nonfiction only, please. I do not like genre mash-ups a la the literary detective novel or the literary fantasy. Literary should be literary and genre should be genre, and crossbreeding rarely results in anything satisfying. I do not like children's books, especially ones with orphans, and I prefer not to clutter my shelves with young adult. I do not like anything over four hundred pages or under one hundred fifty pages. I am repulsed by ghostwritten novels by reality television stars, celebrity picture books, sports memoirs, movie tie-in editions, novelty items, and -- I imagine this goes without saying -- vampires.\nC'mon, you know you agree with at least some of his opinions!Can you really can tell everything you need to know about a person by asking them the name of their favorite book? Try it some time.And finally, I found it interesting that at least a dozen people have added to their to-read lists the completely fictitious book-within-a-book - the late bloomer by the equally fictitious Leon Friedman.Behold the power of fiction!"}, {"userName": "Tadiana \u2729Night Owl\u263d", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8734459-tadiana-night-owl", "userReview": "[death of a main character from cancer (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "Chelsea (chelseadolling reads)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16219087-chelsea-chelseadolling-reads", "userReview": "Omg.

J. Fikry, the irascible owner, is about to discover just what that truly means.A. J. Fikry\u2019s life is not at all what he expected it to be. His wife has died, his bookstore is experiencing the worst sales in its history, and now his prized possession, a rare collection of Poe poems, has been stolen. Slowly but surely, he is isolating himself from all the people of Alice Island--from Lambiase, the well-intentioned police officer who\u2019s always felt kindly toward Fikry; from Ismay, his sister-in-law who is hell-bent on saving him from his dreary self; from Amelia, the lovely and idealistic (if eccentric) Knightley Press sales rep who keeps on taking the ferry over to Alice Island, refusing to be deterred by A.J.\u2019s bad attitude. Even the books in his store have stopped holding pleasure for him. These days, A.J. can only see them as a sign of a world that is changing too rapidly.And then a mysterious package appears at the bookstore. It\u2019s a small package, but large in weight. It\u2019s that unexpected arrival that gives A. J. Fikry the opportunity to make his life over, the ability to see everything anew. It doesn\u2019t take long for the locals to notice the change overcoming A.J.; or for that determined sales rep, Amelia, to see her curmudgeonly client in a new light; or for the wisdom of all those books to become again the lifeblood of A.J.\u2019s world; or for everything to twist again into a version of his life that he didn\u2019t see coming. As surprising as it is moving, The Storied Life of A. J. Fikry is an unforgettable tale of transformation and second chances, an irresistible affirmation of why we read, and why we love.", "title": "The Storied Life of A.J.
