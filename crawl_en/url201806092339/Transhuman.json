And then there's the science, but because it's Hickman it's quazi-weird science fictiony science.If this had focused on the evil plotting monkeys and the people wanting super powers and it going horribly wrong for them, it might have been a better book.But, while there are some good ideas, the overall result isn't great. Took me 4 separate sit downs to read the whole thing. I'd recommend for Hickman completists only (even then I'd try and find a cheap copy)"}, {"userName": "Mario", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15433891-mario", "userReview": "Very interesting story. The \"documentary\" style added to the opportunities for humor in this sci-fi drama. The art and design, on the other hand, is definitely not up to the level of Hickman's other works. And they are an integral part of his style(just look at \"The Nightly News\" or \"Pax Americana\").As much as I liked it, and I did enjoy the story, this is among the lowest rated of Hickman's amazing body of work, for me. That aside, you should definitely give this one a read if you're into sci-fi, graphic novels, or anything by Jonathan Hickman."}, {"userName": "Thom Dunn", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3715519-thom-dunn", "userReview": "This book uses gorgeous artwork to tell an original story about the rise of Transhumanism as a corporate pissing match, and it embodies everything that is wrong with Jonathan Hickman as a writer.Don't get me wrong, Hickman is incredibly creative and kind of a mad genius \u2014 he's just a terrible storyteller. I've come to accept this fact. TRANSHUMAN is told as a \"documentary\" about the rise of the 3 largest Transhumanist corporations, which I guess is a clever conceit, except (1) why make a fictional documentary as a graphic novel? Why not, ya know, write a screenplay? and (2) the nature of those \"60 Minutes\"-style factual reporting documentary is, by nature, a summary, and therefore not a story. The story is told through interviews with a narrator and the people involved in the story, but they are literally just TELLING the reader what happened. It's almost remarkable that a graphic novel \u2014 a medium which is visual by nature \u2014 could rely so much on telling and not showing, and therefore breaks one of the cardinal rules of fiction writing. Sure, there are some interesting characters, and probably some cool dramatic, personal moments between them \u2014 namely, the divorced couple who end up working together on the Transhumanist project despite their mutual hatred for one another, who ultimately backstab each other again \u2014 but frankly, it's not very interesting to just see someone tell you that. I want to see it happen, I want to witness their interpersonal relations. If these were a real-life documentary from 50 years from now, and it aired on 60 Minutes or whatever, it would probably be great, because investigative journalism can get away with digging deep and just reciting facts (although I'd argue that most award-winning works of investigative journalism still manage to find a compelling human angle, something for the audience to emotionally engage with that makes them follow the story through to the end). In TRANSHUMAN, we just get a bunch of talking heads telling us what already happened, and a narrator / director to steer us away from any unreliable sources. There is literally nothing compelling or human to pull you through the story.When Hickman first broke out onto the comics scene, I thought he was fantastic, but the truth is, he's good at creating the ILLUSION of good story telling. Everything he writes is done in summary, with a few cool moments in between to make it feel human. A friend of mine summed it up well as citing the difference between \"The Lord of the Rings\" and \"The Silmarillion\" \u2014 one is a story about characters that we care about, the other is a play-by-play history book, and Hickman writes the latter. I think Hickman would be better off as an idea man, leaving other people to actually execute these epic stories of his. Because the worlds he creates are always unique and fascinating, full of complex politics and otherworldly visions. But saying \"HERE'S THIS CRAZY WORLD I CREATED AND THERE ARE THESE GUYS AND THEN THESE TWO FOUGHT AND THEN THIS GUY BETRAYED THIS GIRL AND THEN THIS PERSON WON, THE END\" is really not a fun story to read."}, {"userName": "Paul W.", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4692703-paul-w", "userReview": "This was entertaining but a little too wink and nod for me. Hickman tries to mix some humor with an interesting subject, but instead ends up with less of both. He does some X-men analogues and but it doesn't show his usual cleverness and verve. Without any clear heroes or villains, it just seems somewhat flat. It could have and should have been better."}, {"userName": "Rebekka", "userReviewDate": "Feb 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11605144-rebekka", "userReview": "I liked the concept and story idea; however, found it difficult to concentrate and become fully immersed inthe world due to the documentary style story-telling.

It's damned addictive, because Hickman tantalises the reader with hints and tidbits of massive changes to human history that he's deliberately withholding from us.This book also surprised me with something I'm not used to from Hickman: emotional undercurrents and \"dirty\" art. Hickman has an ear for smarm and other passive-aggressive emotional tone, and he's sarcastic and dry enough to bring out some genuine belly laughs from me.And the art is a nice departure for what Hickman allows/directs: Ringuet does the clear cues as well as other Hickman artists, but he also has a more organic and definitely \"spattered\" style in this book's art that lends an extra layer of \"verite\" to the documentary format. The book conveys a virile sense of petty emotions, veering careening jealousies and overall bad behaviours. It's quite an indictment of all those with whom Hickman must've worked in his pre-comics career, because this sure reads like an up-close-and-personal examination of personalities and egos that I sure wouldn't expect to be able to invent out of thin air."}, {"userName": "Anna", "userReviewDate": "Oct 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14428846-anna", "userReview": "Issue 1 - Interesting way to write this - in a documentary style. I'm feeling an underlying \"badness\" leaking through the pages that I'm sure will come up eventually.Issue 2 - Losing interest here. All the money talk and business stuff is boring to me. Though I was a bit amused by the We3 reference...Issue 3 - Still rather bored with the business jargon, even to the point where the story itself is getting boring. I don't much care about the monkeys. I care about the genetic enhancement stuff, but that doesn't seem to be permeating the comic as much as I'd like.Issue 4 - The ten years after was pretty boring too. Until the last few pages (although I saw the bit with the narrator coming). Then everything wrapped up pretty nicely. Amazingly, in fact. Interesting idea to think about.Overall - The last few pages stuck out for me more than the rest of the series, since I think most of the story was lost in business and politics. But the idea of the comic was pretty frightening. However, I find it to be interesting that mankind's downfall was merely because of a stationary choice in evolution. I still could see that as evolution/adaptation, even if it isn't transitory. But I understand how this story developed otherwise in relation to nature."}, {"userName": "David Maine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/588387-david-maine", "userReview": "Jonathan Hickman came to my attention three years ago, when he was writing independent comics and publishing them through Image. his debut The Nightly News was fantastic, blending a strong visual/graphic arts sense with a fractured storyline. Transhuman is his follow-up and it's not quite as good. Although entertaining, it's short (four issues, or chapters, as compared to six), and it feels a little thin. It's still entertaining and the art is okay, but it's neither as good as The Nightly News nor Pax Romana, which would come after. Hickman on a bad day is still better than most comic writers at their best, though, so this is worth a look. In recent years he's joined Marvel and gotten pretty silly writing SHIELD and Fantastic Four and so on. I hope he returns to his own original work soon--the man has ideas to burn and it's a shame to see them in the service of the corporate monolith.

Humanity has been transformed by robotic implants and genetic engineering, and \"Transhuman\" takes on a \"behind-the-music\" journey through the corporate misconduct and mutated super-monkeys it took to get there.It's a decent idea, but the execution doesn't quite work. The story here is too slapdash to serve as a serious exploration of the concept, but there aren't enough laughs for it to serve as a spoof either. (Plenty of the jokes revolve around rape too.) I've enjoyed Hickman's other work, but this seemed pretty mean-spirited without offering much in return, and I was happy to be done with it.The art by JM Ringuet isn't too my taste either--it's sketchy and inky, with lots of heavy lines and ugly faces.

Open it and start checking out the pages and the first thing that crosses your mind is: \"webdesign\". This comic looks like a website! Indeed, not only the design of the covers of the chapters calls out for the web user in me, but along the story there's little details that keep evoking the web. Very... wiki-like! I friggin' love it.The story is all about transhumanism in a documentary style. It's as if we, the reader, are watching a doc, years past the events of the story. It's not just that, though.

In a few cases, Hickman chose cute or snarky over believable, giving it a style halfway between a dark humor mockumentary and a serious cautionary tale. The blend did not always work well, although the ape versions of the X-Men and a nod to the series We3 were both amusing. The discussion of the boundaries of sentience and the morality of bio-enhancement were the strong points of the serious side. Unfortunately, a few scenes were played for shock value, in ways not quite convincing. Mad science at its worst, among other things.Still, the story had its moments, enough that it was worth reading. Be warned, though, that there is a really weird cross-species rape scene, and a pretty offensive follow-up to that part of the story [rape victim reaction, which doesn't show up until later in the book.
