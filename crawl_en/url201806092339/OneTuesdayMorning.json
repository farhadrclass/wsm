I saw it at the store not long after 911, and because of that, wasn't sure I was up to reading anything about 911. Only because of the fireman on the cover, I bought it. My husband's a fireman.Well, I was quickly drawn into the story. It was well written and a great read, keeping you turning the pages, wanting to see what happens next.I finished the book, and thought it was really good; I couldn't get the brother, Clay, out of my mind. I really like his character and felt so bad for him. Little did I know, there was another book. Beyond Tuesday Morning. And guess what...Clay's back!Beyond Tuesday Morning:I can't tell you how excited I was to not only find out there was more/another book, but that it was about my favorite character from the first book...Clay!This is one of those books that stay with you forever. Someday I'll probably read it again. For now, I've convinced my twelve-year-old to read it. I had passed my copy on to a friend; I thought it was that good. I then had to purchase another copy for my daughter to read, but I thought it was well worth it."}, {"userName": "Ashley W", "userReviewDate": "Sep 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5167558-ashley-w", "userReview": "This book, centered around the 9/11 attacks, is a very poignant novel with heavy Christian themes. Jake Bryan is a fireman who believes in God while his wife, Jamie, is a nonbeliever who doubts his faith. Despite this, the two are very much in love and together, dote on their bubbly four year old daughter, Sierra. They live in Staten Island. Meanwhile, Eric Michaels is an ambitious businessman who puts his job before his wife and seven year old son, Josh, occasionally missing important events, such as his son's birthday. The Michaels family resides in Los Angeles. Eric soon goes on a business trip to his New York office on the 64th floor of the South Tower of the World Trade Center. The date? September 11, 2001.As Eric attempts to escape the building after his crazy boss begs him to stay to close a deal, Jake is heading up to the impact zone, an area he knows is rife with casualties. Eric falls. Jake helps him up. Their eyes meet. The two men are nearly identical in every way. Seconds later, they continue on their separate ways. Little do they both know their families will become intertwined as only one of them survives that treacherous day.As I said, this book is very poignant and a definite tearjerker. The September 11 attacks on America are not easy subjects to write about but Karen Kingsbury does so with grace, entwining the lives of these two families, and the Bible verses and lessons were helpful to a growing Christian such as myself. It taught me that even though bad things happen, God is still there to help you along the way.I did however have one major problem with this book, and that was the character of Jamie Bryan. I know she was meant to begin the story as a non Christian, but she was really self-absorbed, but even so, there was no need to portray her as a vain, selfish person. I meant I know she worried about her husband, but so were so many others and I can't believe she was so deluded as to want to tell people everything was okay because she was thinking her husband wasn't in the building, like since her husband in her eyes wasn't hurt, she didn't care about anything else.Grade: A-"}, {"userName": "Anna Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5502930-anna-rebecca", "userReview": "I wasn't very sure about this book. My first thought was that if it wasn't written with a lot of compassion then it would really do a great disservice to those that lost their lives on 9/11. However, the book came highly recommended from several people so I decided to try it.I had mixed reactions to the book. The thing that really stuck out the most was that the plot simply wasn't believable. However, this is fiction so I pushed that thought aside. The writing was OK but didn't wow me. The character development was, again, OK but nothing happened with the characters that I didn't already expect. The one thing that I really did like was that the author didn't at all shy away from the whole issue of salvation and it's utter importance in our lives."}, {"userName": "Heather Jasinski", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16861405-heather-jasinski", "userReview": "Karen Kingsbury is such a great Christian writer.

The fictionalized story placed in the 9/11 event felt too contrived. I know this is fickle of me to say as I love plenty of books that are a fictional story placed in a historical event. I wonder if this one just didn't feel right to me, because I remember 9/11 so clearly, and most other historical fiction I read contains events from before my lifetime. This book is pretty heavy on the Christianity aspect with lots of scripture quoting, prayer, and church attendance. Being a daily-Bible-reading Christian myself this did not bother me but just surprised me a little. I listened to this one, and it had multiple readers. I decided I might actually prefer one reader when I listen to audio books.I liked the writing and would give another book by this author a chance. I think I'll just avoid 9/11 stories from now on. **No language.

Although this book is fictional, it is couldn\u2019t be more accurate with this historical information within it. If I did not know any better, I may not have known it was not a true story. The attention that Kingsbury paid to detail is remarkable, and it really takes the book to a whole new level. While the characters may be fictitious, the content could not be rooted in the truth any more than it was written in. I believe that this book was not only written for entertainment, but also as an acknowledgement of respect for the people who were involved with that day. This book displayed a few notable themes throughout itself. One of the ones I noticed to stick out was its emphasis on faith. As a Christian, Kingsbury incorporates her religion into her books as much as possible, and this one wasn\u2019t an exception. Christianity holds a big part of this book, which I enjoy very much. Another theme observed was love. Love was shown in many different lights throughout One Tuesday Morning. A few of these were the love between a husband and wife, the love between a parent and a child, the love between friends, and of course the love of God. However, sometimes it wasn\u2019t love being shown, but rather the lack there of. Kingsbury really made the reader feel for the characters in the book, making it even more wonderful.One Tuesday Morning was written as a narration. It told a story through a series of chronological events. It followed the lives of two different families living thousands of miles apart. However, because of certain occurrences, these families\u2019 lives came crashing together. It really paints an amazing picture of the time you read about. It is like watching a movie unfold in front of your eyes with only the use of written words.I loved this book. I am not an avid reader, but I couldn\u2019t put this book down. I really liked the way it was constructed, and it was very well written. I had a hard time not tearing up at certain parts of the book, and that was surprising to me. The way she makes the reader feel about the characters is astounding. I would recommend this book to anyone who is at least in high school, only because of the advanced grammar and slightly mature content. The only thing I would want to change is the predictability of which character would make it out alive. Other than that, this was one of the best books I\u2019ve read in a long time."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682283-barb", "userReview": "A devoted fireman and a driven businessman, strangers with the same face. Only one will leave the Twin Towers alive, but will he ever find his way home? On the morning of September 11, 2001, two men meet in a smoky stairwell of the World Trade Center. One is Eric Michaels, a driven financial manager from Los Angeles who has been busy climbing the corporate ladder, often at the expense of his wife and young son. The other is Jake Bryan, a New York City fireman devoted to his wife and daughter. In the midst of the crisis, Eric falls on the stairs and Jake stops to help him up. The two men freeze momentarily, stunned by the uncanny resemblance between them. Later, after the building has crumbled to the ground, Eric awakes beneath a fire truck. He is burned and bloody and most of his clothes have been blown off. A fire captain rushes to his side, thinking he recognizes his friend Jake. By the time Jake's wife arrives at the hospital, Eric's face is bandaged and his memory gone. In the months that follow, Eric struggles to relate to a wife and daughter he doesn't remember, while on the opposite coast Eric's real wife grieves and finds comfort from Eric's brother, a single man who has always adored her. The emotional suspense builds as Eric begins to have disturbing dreams and flashbacks---and questions grow in Jake's wife's mind. The only way for Eric to find his way is by following the love of a special woman, and the footsteps of a man who no longer exists.This is one of the most emotionally involved books i have ever read. I had to stop to take in all i was reading a few times. Yet i couldn't put it down. You just HAVE to know what happens next. It's one of those books that you never ever will forget. 5 stars (plus)"}, {"userName": "Connie Horton", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19371794-connie-horton", "userReview": "I've owned this book for 15 years and have never gotten past page 5.

I was four years old when 9/11 happened, and I still vaguely recall the television reports, and I was living on a little rural Canadian island at the time so for stories to hit the news where I lived, they had to be huge. 9/11 was. Anybody my age or older likely had their lives affected in some way or other, either by seeing it on the news, losing a colleague, friend or family member in the attacks, or by residing in New York City at the time. I've found that books on 9/11 can often be distasteful, focusing too much on carnage or conspiracy theories without capturing the true spirit and resilience of those who lived through it. Luckily One Tuesday Morning manages to evade this, and its style of writing is both realistic and gripping all at the same time. There are many characters in this book whose lives are affected, and who come together in the face of tragedy."}, {"userName": "Paulin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416481-paulin", "userReview": "Finished reading One Tuesday Morning by Karen Kingsbury yday & started reading its sequel last nyt. I learned that what matters in life is Jesus alone. He holds ur world when everything else falls apart, when ur loved ones r gone, when u lost even urself or even ur identity, the only person that will matter is Christ a...lone. He then can choose to allow u to stand up, move on & find yourself once again in Him.Climbing the corporate ladder, yearning power and pursuing success in this world according to the world standard is just but rubble, trash, garbage, and dung, in the eyes of God.Whey are we killing ourselves in clamoring for all of these when we have Jesus in our lives, is what I can't understand because in the end, it wouldn't matter anyway. After all, in heaven, the gold that most of us are in pursuit of, are just mere roads that are being trampled upon!Thank you God that in reading One Tuesday Morning, you reminded me what I learned sometime ago:1. What really matters is our strong, intimate and personal relationship with You my Saviour, Lord and Redeemer2. The time we spend with our family and love ones.3. How much we spend our time in reading the bible, having quiet time but most of all encountering God in His Word.Because in our heavenly quest of knowing Jesus, everything else you need will be given by the One who has the best for us always anyways."}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7021960-matt", "userReview": "I liked this book although I kind of wish I didn't' already know it was a case of mistaken identity. Don't worry this is not a spoiler alert you know this from the very beginning. I guess the book has gotten some criticism for not being historically accurate to the time line of events that day. That does not really bother me, its a fiction book so I expect some poetic license, also the author notes in the beginning tells you upfront that she changed a few things around from that day, so I don't see why everyone is so bent out of shape.With all of that said, the idea that two identical strangers cross paths on that day and one of those strangers is thrown right in the path of the other strangers friends is a little implausible, but I shall hold judgment until the end.Now that I've finished the book I will admit it grew on me, and I've already started the second book in the series. It was the message that everything happesn for a reason, and even the worse tradgedy in world will always turn out for the best.

The writing is very heavily Christian; there's lots and lots of talk about God. I come from a strong Christian family where it is not strange to talk about God in our daily lives, but the writing in this book seemed unrealistic at times-a little over the top. However, this book is very touching. It brought back the horrible memories of 9/11...even though I wasn't directly touched by this tragedy. The scene between the two firefighters when they knew that the south tower was about to come down and they were on the 61st floor brought tears streaming down my face. I can't imagine knowing my death was going to happen within a few seconds. This book did reinforce my belief that I can trust God with my little and my big worries and to \"lean not on my own understanding.\" I also feel honored and fortunate that we have emergency personnel that are willing to give their lives to keep our citizens safe.

The book is set around 911 and is about two entirely different families who have to learn to cope with the loss of the men they loved. They learn to deal with this by leaning on the family and friends that surround them. I believe that God has a plan for all of us and in this novel you begin to understand what his plan is for these characters. You begin to realize that just because something is painful and unbelievably hard to deal with that maybe there is a greater purpose for what happened.

In fact, it's the first book about the topic I've ever been able to finish reading. I couldn't read 'The 9/11 Commission.' It seems like every year that's passed since 2001, we've learned some major piece of information about our loved one who died that day or something related to it.This year's discovery was truly horrific. It was like nothing I ever imagined could have occurred, but it already HAS happened. If I'd known about it any time beFORE 2010, I honestly believe the information would have killed me.I have no idea why I'm continuing to read this book. I have a hard time believing that I'm that much of a glutton for punishment. I can't read 2 pages, sometimes, without being racked with memories that come with barbs all over them, hidden in places I never thought possible, ready to inject me with unpleasant memories.In other parts I have no reaction at all, which lulls me into a false sense of security. At least until I'm hit with the next set of hidden barbs that pierce me with agonizing memories.I have no idea why under those circumstances I would still be reluctant to put it down. It's just that she's a good writer for the most part. The mechanics of her writing are almost flawless, it's obvious why she's a best-selling author, and that makes me think that maybe she has answers where none have come when I search for them in reference to this issue.My daughter has asked me several questions that to this day I can't answer. I simply don't know why this happened and whether his soul survived the fire. Her dad was completely (and literally) burned out of existence. None of his earthly remains have ever been identified. That made my daughter wonder if his soul was also burned away. I had no clue when she asked and I'm little better enlightened now as to whether that could occur.All I know is it got on my nerves when bin Laden devotees insisted that the United States give them bin Laden's body so he \"could have a proper Muslim burial.\" Muslims don't believe in being buried at sea, and they thought we were rude when we refused to hand over his body.That made me ungodly furious. I thought 'You guys didn't give a tinman's DAMN about all the bodies that were burned out of existence from the fires you started, and now you ask for his body. You request mercy in the highest degree? And reSPECT from us?'I thought they must be crazy. Then they got angry when bin Laden was buried at sea against their wishes. They said Americans were being dishonorable about his burial b/c Muslims don't believe in being buried that way.President Obama told them he thinks \"bin Laden's burial was more respectable than his nearly 3,000 American victims, who were burned to death, some of whom couldn't have burials and had to have memorials or empty casket burials.\"I was glad he said it. In light of what I recently learned about Bush's Torture Program and RDI (rendition, detention and interrogation using physical, mental, emotional and spiritual torture to get Muslim detainees to reveal what they knew of Al Qaeda), it's truly devastating to read the events of September 11 and re-experience what we saw that day.As long as Bush remains remorseless for his involvement in the whole thing (Or maintains a cavalier public image about it) I can guarantee that I'll never trust him again.In the words of a fictional Republican person, \"If I'd known he was going to be so bad at responding to a crisis, I never would have voted for him.\" --Julia Shumway, from Under the Dome, the BOOK not the television series.*****************************It's like 'O my stars.' I've never read a book that made me fall off the concentration track so many times that I LITERALLY can't even read it right now. I have to wait again.I never thought that reading about events before the catastrophe would confuse me this bad.I just sort of thought that after 12 years issues like THAT would have worked themSELVES out.It always makes me bristle when people say phrases like \"Don't forget that it happened.\" I always want to say, \"Well unless I decide to stop talking to my daughter, stop looking at her, stop observing her mannerisms - some of which are STILL like her dad's - I'm certain I'm never going to develop amnesia concerning what we lost that day.My daughter and I watched Tower 1 crumbling to the ground knowing her dad was trapped inside and some days later, I was told they \"had to stop looking for him, b/c we're considering him dead.\"I told my daughter, b/c I didn't want her to hear it from them, but I said to her \"These people want me to tell you we have to stop looking for your dad, b/c they're considering him dead.\"It took me over 2 weeks to finally stop believing something like amnesia had occurred and made him forget his family. There were several cases of true amnesia, so I held out for the idea that they took him to a hospital and that he was still unidentified, that I needn't worry b/c he would be returning.It would literally take almost 5 YEARS before that feeling of numbness and disbelief stopped washing over me at every inopportune moment of my day.And it would take until May 2, 2011 before the recurring dream of him ended. At least it gave up its nightly appearances. I had it one more time a year later and haven't had it since. From May 2, 2011 to today I've had the dream once.The finding of Usama bin Laden made the dream disappear on its own after putting in appearances night after night from 2001 to 2011. That's hardly a coincidence IMO. To go from something happening all the time against your will to stopping all at once? I find that highly a suspicious coincidence.I now believe his soul refused to rest in peace until they found the man who separated him from his daughter, whom he loved as much as skyline sunshine.
