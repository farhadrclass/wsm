After a lot of thought, this book is between 3.5 and 4 stars, but much closer to 4 stars.Saving Ben by Ashley Farely is a new adult book, taking place during college years, a time in which I have a special place in my heart. The book stars Katherine, who seems to have it all-- a wealthy lifestyle and a brother who dotes on her. But her parents have their own issues and have been distant, and she is excited to get out of her brother's protective eye. She joins him at UVA as a freshman, and meets her gorgeous and seemingly perfect roommate, Emma, who slowly shows her true colors the longer she is around. To make matters worse, she has Ben under her spell, and things slowly fall apart. Then Emma goes missing.The first half of this book was completely riveting. I loved the setup of the book, which while not the most new idea (it reminds me of Poison Ivy and a couple of other movies where the crazy girl wants to take over another girl's life), the setting, atmosphere, and strong characterization of Katherine, her brother, and their friends, made it unique in its own way. The second half was less strong, but had some great twists, and I think it ended plot wise the only way it could. My main issue with this book is that the second half seemed a lot more telling instead of showing, which was more dramatically seen for me, since the first half did not have this issue. Because of this, a particular relationship that occurs did not have the same impact that it probably should have. That said, I raced through this book from cover to cover, and it was a very strong first novel. I think that Farley will just get better and better."}, {"userName": "Amy's Book Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8149327-amy-s-book-reviews", "userReview": "DNF due to heavy handed mediocre writing (all tell no show), unlikable narrator and brother and I had more sympathy for the sociopath."}, {"userName": "Cyndy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11319379-cyndy", "userReview": "This book is unbelievably AWFUL.

Most notably Emma, which I think is probably kind of predictable considering she's a psychopath. She's so damn good at it, she doesn't seem to just be a character in a book. I was paranoid that I would run into a girl like this in real life\u2014although I think I'm safe because I'm not rich enough to have designer clothes for her to steal. Emma was psycho. She was diabolical and evil and a monster and every other word you can come up with. Huge commendation to the author for making all of the characters seem real, including Emma. She was deceitful and manipulating, but of course none of the other characters realized it right away. I have the unfair advantage of being the reader and reading the synopsis. My favorite character was actually Abby. And everything that happened with her made me want to give the poor girl a big hug and take her away from that place. That probably wouldn't be enough to suffice after all the crap she went through but she seemed so real, so tangible I felt this might have been an actual option at some point. She was sweet and a good person and I ached for her. The actual plot line was so amazing. There was that brief bit in the beginning to give us a glimpse into where the story would lead. Everything after that was so well done and the writing flowed perfectly. I'm pretty sure this is an indie author, but there's no evidence to support this. Generally a lot of the writing will be a bit clunky and the dialogue won't be natural. In this case that wasn't an issue. Again, the characters seemed so real that it was just amazing. The way Emma slowly upped the ante and sabotaged Katherine's life through Ben was fantastically done. She managed to turn Ben and his mother against Katherine, despite her being the only one with any real rationale. The tension was strong. The hostility and animosity Katherine felt for Emma was definitely something I shared with her. I wanted her to pay for what she had done. Especially after everything she said to Abby, which I'm pretty sure had a great deal to do with Abby's deterioration. Emma's character was perfect. Her comments were never overt and were just passable enough for the others to let is slide. She was never over the top, which I think is a huge accomplishment. So many authors try to make an \u201cevil\u201d character and then overdo it, making it kind of comical. In this case that wasn't an issue.I can't properly explain how great this book is. I absolutely loved it and I'm so glad I came across it. It's a worthwhile read that is very well done and worth taking a look at."}, {"userName": "Michelle", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12892801-michelle", "userReview": "Had a hard time getting into this book.

Saving Ben is about Katherine in her first year in college with her older brother who's two years in to college. This story does cover almost two years but not in a way that annoys you.The problem of the story is Emma and what happened to her. Because in the first chapter it is Ben and Katherine seeing footprints out into a dock with a boathouse, where Emma presumably is. There are a lot of characters, like family, and friends.

The dialogue was very uncomfortable at first and seemed forced in writing. I equate it to someone having started writing this in high school and then returned to it several years after college without rereading the beginning and fixing the choppy dialogue. In Saving Ben we find two unnaturally close pairs of brother-sister siblings who spend their summers together at their lake houses with their clich\u00e9ly distant well off parents. Ben and Kitty\u2019s relationship seems almost inappropriate, and even one of the other characters mentions it. It was very distracting. When Kitty starts school at the University of Virginia with her brother, who is two years her senior, she takes her chances with \u201cthe roommate lottery.\u201d Enter Emma Stone \u2013 that\u2019s her full character name, can I get an eye roll please - stage right. Let me interrupt and make a call to the casting directors of Hollywood. If and when this book is made into a B level movie I\u2019ll go ahead and tell you now that Bella Thorne wouldn\u2019t even have to play a character if she was cast as Emma. From her Instagram page and various other movie roles, Thorne would make the perfect Emma. She could simply tap back into her character from You Get Me which holds a similar young adult stalker storyline. Overall this is a great book for a weekend read. It\u2019s quick, emotional, and suspenseful even if the ending is slightly rushed and disappointing. There are just too many stories in one book that deserve more detail and attention. The book just wraps up in a sloppy way and leaves the reader unsatisfied."}, {"userName": "Gina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5460575-gina", "userReview": "Goodreads Description- A boy, his sister, and her psychopathic roommate. A New Year\u2019s Eve party, a missing person, and a single set of footprints in the snow.Life is sweet for Katherine Langley, a first-year student at the University of Virginia. She is finally free from the drama of her parents\u2019 dysfunctional marriage and ready to focus on studying to become a nurse. Her brother, Ben, belongs to the hottest fraternity on campus, and her roommate, Emma, is beautiful and charming, a party girl whose answer for a hangover is happy hour. She is also a psychopath. When obsessive-compulsive Ben succumbs to Emma\u2019s charms and falls dangerously off-track, Katherine must save her brother from himself. From the University of Virginia campus to a cozy cottage on Carter\u2019s Creek, Saving Ben is a haunting tale of love and loyalty, anger management, substance abuse, and betrayal. ***The book starts out with Katherine, \"Kitty\", starting her freshman year at UVA where her older brother Ben also goes to school. Kitty comes from a fairly wealthy background and she is mostly concerned, at first, that Ben will be overprotective and interfere with her ever finding a guy. We also meet Kitty's eccentric roommate Emma who immediately latches onto Kitty for friendship and support. When Ben and Emma meet, sparks fly and they are thrown into an immediate relationship. Once Emma gets a taste of Ben and Kitty's more affluent life the reader begins to see the psychopathy in Emma's personality and she starts to bring Ben down the wrong road filled with alcohol and drugs. Worried about her brother, Kitty now finds herself as Ben's caretaker as she sees just how manipulative Emma can be. The story is told from Kitty's point of view and the reader watches as Emma becomes crazier and crazier while Ben seems to be spiraling downward. There are other secondary characters, friends from school and home and I felt the most for Abby because Emma targeted her while she was weak and was ultimately responsible for what happens. The beginning of the story starts out strong and Farley does an excellent job at showing not telling the story. However, the second half of the book seemed rushed and left bare. So much more could have been added to make the ending much more satisfying.One thing I didn't understand was why after all of the times Emma showed her psychopathic self did Kitty ever just tell her no or to leave? Kitty was a sophomore by the end of the book and when Emma crashed the New Year party, why did they all let her stay? Even after a physical altercation between Emma and Kitty, Emma wasn't told to leave. This seemed very immature and not congruent with what a 20 year old would do in a situation like the one on New Years.This is the author's debut novel and it was okay. I think there is room for growth. She had a good idea for a plot but didn't execute it very well. I do have another book written by a Farley and will read it with hope that her writing will improve because there were definitely some well written parts. She needs to follow through with that type of writing to the end. 3 stars."}, {"userName": "\u2615 Kimberly ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082615-kimberly", "userReview": "Five reasons to curl up with Saving Ben  Katherine Langley wakes on New Year\u2019s Day to find her brother\u2019s girlfriend Emma missing and a single set of footprints leading to the dock on the lake. \u00a0Farley then takes us back to when Katherine \u201cKitty\u201d and her brother Ben met Emma. We spent most of our time learning about Emma and her impact on them as we move towards the footprints in the snow. \n   The whole time you are reading you will be pondering the question, \u201cIs Emma missing, dead or kidnapped?\u201d It added suspense and every character becomes a possible suspect. Did they do something to Emma? Farley takes us from campus to the Langley\u2019s summer home giving us a glimpse into their lives with delightful detail. \n   Farley weaved in siblings, their friends and family. \u00a0We witness the strains Emma puts on these relationships, the manipulation and the lies. All of it was realistic and kept me connected. From Kitty\u2019s strained relationship with her mother to the protectiveness of her brother, Farley fleshed out each character without over the top drama. Emma is a vivid character who will evoke strong feelings from the reader and none of them pleasant. Motive isn't hard to understand\u00a0and we quickly assume foul play. \n   We see relationships in many stages and not just of the romantic variety. We do see the siblings develop romances but these are side stories and weave in and out of the main mystery thread. Little side threads dealing with friends and loss had substance and Farley weaved them into the tale in a clever way. She touches on drug use, teenage alcoholism, bullying, parental issues and suicide adding some depth. \n   Twists and turns made the tale exciting leading up to the footprints and disappearance. The second half of the book ended up being more telling than showing, which was disappointing. While Farley wraps things up, I would have liked to see things unfold a little more slowly. However, Saving Ben was a refreshing mystery and something we need more of in the new adult genre. \n   Copy gifted by author.

I had no idea where the story was going at first, and it was a lot of telling not showing. The entire story is narrated by Katherine. It is just her telling what happened so the telling wasn't as annoying at first, though I do like showing better. At first Katherine is drawn in by Emma, and her brother Ben is instantly attracted to her. Emma right from the start is a little off. She gets more manipulative and such the longer the story goes on.I was going along with the story just fine for most of the book, even if it was a bit boring. I saw how everyone was worried about Ben, but they couldn't really do anything since he will do what he wants to do. He had to reach rock bottom before he could make some changes for himself. Everyone except Ben hated Emma with good reason. I got all of that and went along with it, even though it was told and not shown.Then we get towards the end and I just got sick of everyone being an idiot in regards to Emma. Yes she is crazy. Yes they all hate her, so why do they still let her crash their party? Why do they still let her spend the night? You get in a physical altercation with her and yet you still let her stay? Ben says she is stalking him and you still think this is a good idea? From then on it was just like what are you thinking?!? Why would you get in the car with crazy guy you think is the killer? Why would you do any of these idiotic things you did? Did you learn nothing? I thought you saw through Emma and her games, so why are you still playing into them? It made no sense. Emma was a horrible person, but Katherine was just stupid. I was hoping that she would have grown and learned from her experiences, but I don't think she did. It was just like poor decision after poor decision and I really started to hate it. It just got to be too much.Also posted to Jen in Bookland"}, {"userName": "Adriane", "userReviewDate": "Jun 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9771217-adriane", "userReview": "It is so much fun to read a book that is set where you live! I am from the Richmond area and when I saw that the majority of this book was set in UVA/Charlottesville and Carter's Creek, I was super excited to review it! In fact, traveling between the two, they pretty much drive right past my house! Anyway, onto the book itself (you know, the important stuff!) Katherine (or Kitty) has a psycho roommate, literally. Emma is controlling about everything, and she has gotten her claws into Kitty's brother Ben. Kitty has spent her whole life protecting her brother from one thing or another and she suddenly has to figure out that the only way to save Ben this time is to do nothing. Until the day that Emma goes missing. I'm not really a huge mystery fan, but because of the above mentioned location of the book, I was excited to review this one. But I have to tell you, it was a really good read. Emma is kind of scary. I know that there are people like her out there, and to be honest I'm pretty sure that I was on a hall with one in college. But to see some of the stuff she does is just creepy! Then you have Ben who just gets pulled further and further into the addiction that is Emma. Kitty tries over and over to save him but finally learns that he is the one that has to save himself. I liked the story, but sometimes it was a little hard to connect with the characters. There was a lot of back and forth, and to be honest, a lot of partying. It didn't seem all that realistic to me for the college scene. I know UVA is a pretty tough school, so I would think it would be a little harder and a little more work would have to go into being a student at the school. Overall a good book. I felt like I kind of knew what was going to happen, and didn't feel like it was a huge emotional pull on me like it could have been if I had connected just a little bit more with the characters like I wanted to."}, {"userName": "Toni Osborne", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1970656-toni-osborne", "userReview": "This contemporary mystery main aim is to highlight the special bond between siblings and to bring focus on the many struggles one can experience during college life. This is a haunting tale of love, loyalty, anger management, substance abuse and betrayal.Ben and Kitty are the primary players but Emma is the character to watch for. She is Kitty\u2019s bitchy roommate who brought havoc between brother and sister. Without her this story would not have been quite captivating she is portrayed as a complete psychopath. I love mystery but this one is a bit too soft for my taste, the first half is mainly the set-up of college life: the setting, atmosphere and the relationships, etc. The second half is more dramatic and moves along at a better pace but the suspense is kind of lightweight and the development so predictable I became anxious to see the end. Having said this does not mean it is boring, on the contrary it is quite a sentimental journey.This lively story is told from the perspective of young adults. The portrayal of friendship and the strong characterization is where this story excels. The dialogue is somewhat stilted although I did overcome noticing this after a while. How Ben slowly spiral out of control, starts drinking, does drugs and argues all the time is especially well represented. The serious problems concerning anorexia as well as family issues are also at the forefront. There is something to please everyone even a murder scene for the mystery buffs to enjoy.

From the University of Virginia campus to a cozy cottage on Carter\u2019s Creek, Saving Ben is a haunting tale of love and loyalty, anger management, substance abuse, and betrayal. \u201cThis beautifully designed book might have come from any of the biggest publishing houses and sit shoulder to shoulder with some of the best LOOKING books to be released this year . . .The writing is exceptional and the story compelling with an emotional resonance that demonstrates a maturity to the writing that makes Ashley Farley an author to watch.\u201d\u2014 Judge, Writer\u2019s Digest 21st Annual Self-Published Book Awards", "title": "Saving Ben", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17313435.Saving_Ben", "average": 3.79, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1359759939l/17313435.jpg", "reviews": 144, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6916019.Ashley_Farley", "name": "Ashley Farley"}], "type": ["New Adult", "Mystery", "Fiction", "Young Adult"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17313435-saving-ben", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18903986-saving-ben", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35992068-magnolia-nights", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34390136-sweet-tea-tuesdays", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25202681-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31684773-boots-and-bedlam", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33216759-tangle-of-strings", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28168785-runaway", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35148447-juliet", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35913695-hidden-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198274-kiss-me-while-i-sleep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29420557-breath-of-malice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35839275-kian", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23745439-greensleeves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29639736-everything-we-keep", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26186801-someone-like-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800300-from-thin-air", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18950617-sweet-caroline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800331-to-hope", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33016164-royally-bad", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34609092-royally-ruined", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193474-the-finishing-touches", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193549-roses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19032297-accidentally-in-love-with-a-god", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29231863-splinter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23622993-claimed", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243614-just-jilted", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193601-keeping-you-a-secret", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800455-the-pms-club", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800812-gypsy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35708042-bodyguard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800579-willow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30126159-mosaic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40389026-summer-island", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12369122-because-of-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29373539-the-lullaby-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28441063-secretly-hers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23271170-tycoon-takedown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800411-come-high-water", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33001355-before-i-knew", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205166-the-paradise-of-glass", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32532886-trusting-you-other-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21425515-once-haunted-twice-shy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40272947-the-pursuit-of-tamsen-littlejohn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193595-the-story-of-beautiful-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34873257-the-lullaby-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30184217-say-goodbye-for-now", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205144-bridged", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800690-love-is", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26813208-thirty-five-and-a-half-conspiracies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20489452-thirty-one-and-a-half-regrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20687181-thirty-two-and-a-half-complications", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198652-twenty-eight-and-a-half-wishes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15836745-twenty-nine-and-a-half-reasons", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36685093-the-unimaginable", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29339972-thirty-six-and-a-half-motives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23263614-thirty-three-and-a-half-shenanigans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40199170-thirty-and-a-half-excuses", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24778061-thirty-four-and-a-half-predicaments"]}
