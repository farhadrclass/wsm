The writing is as good as ever, McCall has his own distinctive style - warm, compassionate and almost childlike, but the series has deteriorated into a serial. I suppose it was bound to happen, the endless repetitions about exactly who Mma Ramotswe (and her long-late father, Obed), Mma Makutsi, Mr. J.L.B. Makatoni, Mma Pokowane and the evil Violet Sephotho could not go on and this book has revealed nothing new about them at all. But with only those characters to build the stories around, it has become too cosy and a bit silly. Violet Sephotho is almost a cartoon character in a children's serial - what man will she attempt to scam next?So although the book was enjoyable, it seemed tired compared to the freshness of the first half-dozen books and a bit formulaic. I'm almost at the Jodi Picoult stage - promising myself I won't read yet another one of her-variations-on-a-theme always written the same way, but this series is headed that way.I do like Mma Ramotswe et al very much, but when there isn't anything new to say perhaps its time to call it a day and say goodbye as they all drive off in the little white van into the endless Botswanan sunset."}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1394928-laura", "userReview": "Second read:It's happened. I've come full circle with this series this calendar year. I've read them all, this one twice, and already started on the next. I can't get enough of them, or of the wisdom and wildness of Botswana. Long live Alexander McCall Smith and his wonderful pen!First read:I absolutely love Alexander McCall Smith. If you find yourself in a difficult period, and want some assurance that there is kindness in the world, pick up any of his books and sink in to the happiness. And I'm not talking about fluffy marshmallow sickening sweetness, either. For me, his books have just that balance that I'm looking for. Bad things happen, but nothing is overly violent, there's no bad language, and good wins over evil in the end. I'm going to pick up the next book in the series this month. It's a long series, and when I finish, I'll probably start right back at the beginning again. You'll laugh out loud at some point in every one of these books, and close the cover with a smile. Sometimes, that's just what you want. Note: The audio versions of this series are superb, and highly recommended. Lisette Lecat does a wonderful job with the different voices and moods of the book. Six stars for the audio performance."}, {"userName": "Barb", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/191052-barb", "userReview": "I cannot say enough about Alexander McCall Smith's writing style. Gentle, humorous, touching, and drawing true to life pictures of the human condition. Sometimes I cannot believe he is not a woman - he seems to have fully identified how women think and he amazes me. I crave a trip to Botswana because he has sold the country to me so completely. I cannot say this series is for everyone. It is gentle, real and poignant. It has little action, the mysteries are of the human nature kind and this may be a bit too mellow for some readers.

The pace of life is slow and pleasant in the stories and the main character, Precious Ramotswe, tries so hard to always be kind and help other people. My favorite passage from the book:\"Having the right approach to life was a great gift in this life. Her father, the late Obed Ramotswe, had always had the right approach to life--she was sure of that. And for a moment, as she sat there with her friend, with the late-afternoon sun slanting in through the window, she thought about how she owed her father so much. He had taught her almost everything she knew about how to lead a good life, and the lessons she had learned from him were as fresh today as they ever had been. Do not complain about your life. Do not blame others for things that you have brought upon yourself. Be content with who you are and where you are, and do whatever you can do to bring to others such contentment, and joy, and understanding that you have managed to find yourself.\""}, {"userName": "Deb ", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1378936-deb", "userReview": "\"Be content with who you are and where you are, and do whatever you can do to bring to others such contentment, and joy, and understanding that you have managed to find yourself.\" Armed with this advice from her father, and her red bush tea, Mma Ramotswe again brings order and peace to her corner of Botswana.

Each one is so well written, so poignant and charming, so easy to read; that I'm always done before I know it. Even as I crack open each book, I am sad because I know that all too soon, the story will be over. I just cannot slow myself down, or stop myself from reading, and in a few hours it's all over, and I'm left yearning for the next one. Alexander McCall Smith is one of my favorite authors because he can say so much with very few words. I feel like I really know the characters in his books, like they are friends of mine that I can laugh with and share insights with.I laughed out loud at more parts of this book than in the previous books. One small complaint I would have is that there seemed to be more \"description\" pages - no action or dialogue, just stories or word-painting, that I found a bit tiresome.

Ramotswe and her Number One Ladies Detective Agency in Gaborone, Botswana. The biggest mystery in this series is, how does this Scottish male author manage to convey so insightfully a feminine sensibility? In this volume, Mma Ramotswe again copes with the prickly personality of her right hand woman, Grace Makutsi. After Grace\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is badly injured, she loses contact with him as he recuperates under the watchful eye of a possessive maiden aunt. Grace\u2019s fiance\u2019s injury adds a strain of potential tragedy to the story, but Grace\u2019s love and devotion is unshaken and the main problem that occupies Mma. Ramotswe is how to overcome the aunt\u2019s possessiveness. Meanwhile, Ms. Makutsi\u2019s nemesis, that scheming hussy, Violet Sepotho, resurfaces. This is not to suggest that Violet is now earning an honest living as a floor sander, but rather that she has used deceit and feminine wiles to convince a na\u00efve and trusting man to marry her and put his house in her name. This man, whom she has now left, enlists Mma. Ramotswe\u2019s help in recovering his property. Oh yes, there\u2019s a third problem\u2014how to locate a guide who has been given a bequest by an American woman whom he once guided on a safari, without knowing his name or that of his safari camp. McCall Smith writes with great delicacy and gentle humor, although the story largely repeats familiar motifs. Eventually, all three problems are resolved, although a weakness of the plot is that Mma. Ramotswe actually does little to effect a solution, meaning that she resolves these problems through persistence and improbable good luck more than through ingenuity or daring. At many points in the book, McCall Smith interposes little meditations on life and on traditional values in Botswana. Some may find this entrancing but I found it distracting\u2014better to say what he wants to stay through the story!"}, {"userName": "Trelawn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28949651-trelawn", "userReview": "So many great characters.

I don't know if I would've finished or liked it much if I had read it myself.This book is full of character development more than cases, and while that's true of all of the No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, this book drags a bit more than usual. McCall Smith tries some different stylings at the beginnings-writing from the point of JLB Matekoni, for instance-which are interesting, I guess. I like how he has developed Mma Makutsi's Shoes as supporting characters. The book moves more as it goes along. Bottom line: if you like this series, you'll like this one too. I see the No. 1 Ladies Detective Agency books books as sorbet - light, tasty palate cleansers between other, meatier reads. McCall Smith really does have a gift for describing uniquely African things - ways of thinking, conversation, culture, nature. And if you haven't already, watch the HBO/BBC series, which is how I really started enjoying these books.

I ended up skimming most of this book. It seemed like about 75% of it was the author having his characters thoughts trail off in the middle of a conversation into some totally unrelated area. It was distracting to the plot and totally bogged down the whole book. Most of it could have been edited out and the plot wouldn't have suffered at all. In a nutshell there wasn't much action and very little plot in this one. Most of the characters were just background and not well developed in this one. I think he missed a big opportunity to enhance the Phuti/Grace story line and it just didn't happen.

Mma Precious Ramotswe is back as the detective dealing with a variety of cases, ranging from infidelity to finding an unknown recipient of a bequest left by a beneficent American tourist who enjoyed a safari in the lush but dangerously wild Delta region. Additionally, she must support her assistant, the headstrong and opinionated Grace Makutski, whose fianc\u00e9 has been spirited away by a malicious aunt. Much has changed with Precious since I met her a numberof years ago in the first book. She has married, has two children and has established herself as a respected and wise detective in her community.There is no murder for Precious to solve, but she uses many of her community contacts and solid powers of reasoning, to bring her cases to satisfactory conclusions, But I suspect that most readers do not flock to read the newest Precious volume because of her cases and their solutions. It is more likely that they enjoy the cultural references illustrating Botswana's culture, the humour that pops up unexpectedly, causing outright giggles, and the personality of Precious, herself. McCall uses Precious and her cases to remind us that there are common threads that bind us and Precious together, despite cultural differences. There are elements of Mma Ramotswe's personality that link us all together as humans- love, respect, dignity, and concern for others. She is incredibly wise, and McCall's deceptively simple prose draws us in, and allows us to delve through many layers of meaning, if we so choose."}, {"userName": "Graham", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1760824-graham", "userReview": "A step up from the last book in the series; you feel that Smith is back on solid ground with this instalment. THE DOUBLE COMFORT SAFARI CLUB consists of more of the same from the popular author, with detective Mma Ramotswe and her assistant solving more cases, many of which have a bearing on the human condition.The author mixes up the action a little here by throwing in a surprising twist or two (involving a character suffering a life-changing injury) and relocating the action, in part at least, to another setting, this time a nature reserve (as in the title). For these reasons the writing feels fresh and refreshing, with new life breathed into the old staple characters.In TEA TIME FOR THE TRADITIONALLY BUILT, I felt that the characters were slightly stale and that Smith was getting bored with chronicling their adventures.

Unlike some authors McCall Smith can write a series where each novel satisfies the reader-fans, and his main characters grow and develop in ways that are in character, understandable and yet surprising. It takes real skill to write like that.\tWhy the No. 1 Ladies\u2019 Detective Agency in remote Botswana should have such universal appeal is a mystery. No sex, no violence, no weird sects, perverts, spies or terrorists, how did the first book get past an agent and be picked up by a publisher? Thank God it did. What we read about are the Batswana, people like us, some kind, decent and caring, others selfish and destructive, some prickly and difficult, others lazy and easy going. Just people. What makes the novels special is Mma Ramotswe\u2019s gentle kindness, vast tolerance, and her willingness to see things from another\u2019s point of view. That and her ability to listen make her someone people will come to for help. The problems she has to deal with are those we can identify with, but her way of dealing with them is unique. \tIn \u2018The Double Comfort Safari Club\u2019 a letter from America asks Mma Ramotswe to find a safari camp guide who has been left a legacy by a grateful American visitor. It proves far more tricky than it should, only Mma Ramotswe\u2019s tact turns disaster into a cheerful compromise. Also there is poor Mma Makutsi, assistant detective, in distress because her soon-to-be husband suffered an accident and then is looked after by his aunt. The aunt disapproves of the engagement and wants to separate them. Mma Makutsi is not allowed to see her fianc\u00e9e. There\u2019s an old friend who wants to know if her husband is having an affair, and naughty, on the make Violet Sephotho appears again, causing more work for the ladies. Of course all problems are solved in the end, and Mma Ramotswe learns a little more about herself and about life.

This novel is full of charm, and gentleness, and exhortations to patience and kindness.On pages 38 and 39 I found two classic No. 1 Ladies' lines, being a type of passage that give the flavor to the whole book, and which Smith carefully works in at regular intervals.1st: There were plenty of people who held that there was no material difference between men and women, but such people, she believed, were simply wrong.2nd: \"There is nothing much men can do about their faces,\" she once said to Mma Ramotswe. And Mma Ramotswe, immediately recognising the truth of this, had said, \"No, Mma, that is quite true. Men's faces are very unfortunate. They can do nothing.\"These are great books to read when you're having a hard time. They lift the spirits. They remind me of the Don Camillo books (which came out in English roughly 1948-63), which were one of my happiest discoveries in the Rantoul Public Library a decade later. Those books had a similar charm, and a similar message.Highly recommended.Only one grimace in this novel, by the way."}], "description": "Readers will agree that this touching and dramatic new installment in Alexander McCall Smith\u2019s beloved and best-selling series is the finest yet.
