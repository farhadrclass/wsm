While the suspense and intrigue around the disappearance of Flynn's girlfriend January was a bit formulaic and easily solved (possibly due to the sheer amount of mystery books I've read), I found myself lost in the character's becoming self aware and journey to finding out who he really was. Was there anything ground breaking or new about this book? I didn't feel so, but I still found it a worthy read that drew me in and kept the pace going quickly. I'm very intrigued to see what the author writes next; I'd be super interested in reading something of the YA/GLBT/Coming of Age genre by him; he definitely has 5 star potential IMO and hope to see more from him soon!*many thanks to NetGalley, publisher, and author for my copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Sana", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26402455-sana", "userReview": "DNF @ pg 75this was actually really good. seriously, it was really good, but like, i really dont have the patience for this story and the fucking drama and yelling thats going on. its freaking triggering me and making me want to punch someone. this made me so mad that i flipped to the last 5 pages and read everything and spoiled myself r.i.p i hate myself. why do i do this every. single. time with every. single. book. it's a fucking problem omg. pros:-this is a thriller about a gay boy struggling to keep his identity bc he's afraid for some reason for coming out. -the love ineterests name is Kaz-we get some gay romance. errrrr....thats pretty much it (for me anyways)cons:-its triggering me hard.-the characters fighting about all these misunderstanding is pissing me off. (it's just annoying to me and im just getting heated bc of it)-it's kind of really slow???i would actually have forced myself to finish this, but i spoiled myself in a rage moment. le sigh. i already spoiled myself and no longer care to finish itIm also rating this book unrated bc it was amazing and its not the books fault i dnf it (well kinda) but its mostly me bc i have rage issues and just couldnt stand it. overall, if you want a thriller about self discovery and coming of age, pick this one up. i recommend it 10/10."}, {"userName": "C.G.

His mind races as to why they could be there\u2014did they find the small amount of pot he had hidden in his desk? But he is utterly unprepared for what the police detectives tell him, that his girlfriend January is missing. The thing is, Flynn hasn't seen her in almost a week, and the last time he did see her, she broke up with him. And she's been ignoring his texts and calls since then.January had been unhappy since her mother's new husband, a wealthy politician running for the Senate, moved her to a private school where she felt alienated from all of the other rich students. And although Flynn and January's relationship had its challenges, he cannot figure out why she would have disappeared or what could have happened to her, and their closest friends don't understand it either. But as Flynn digs a little deeper, he finds that the stories January was telling others don't match up with reality. He knows something must have happened to her, and he's determined to find out the truth.But as Flynn tries to uncover the truth about January's disappearance, especially as disturbing evidence surfaces, there is another truth he must face as well\u2014the truth about himself. That may be harder and potentially even more painful than figuring out what happened to January.\nLast Seen Leaving\n is really two books in one. It's both a mystery, as Flynn and others try to figure out the truth behind January's disappearance, and it's also a book about self-acceptance, and finding the strength to embrace your true self. I think the book succeeds more on the latter than the former, and in fact, I think I might have enjoyed it a little more if that was all it focused on. Flynn was a really interesting character, and I liked his interactions with his peers, and his memories of his relationship with January.It's not that the mystery part was bad; I just felt like it was a little formulaic, with stereotypical villains and the predictable (at least to me) red herrings to throw you off the real trail. Everything was wrapped up (somewhat) a little too seamlessly for me, and I kept remembering that Flynn was actually just a high school sophomore as he was acting like the brave detective all of a sudden.While the book is a little uneven, at its heart it's an enjoyable and moving story, one which I can identify with very strongly in places. (The self-acceptance piece, not the disappearing girlfriend one.) Caleb Roehrig is a talented writer and I would have loved more time with Flynn, so I look forward to seeing what's next in Roehrig's career.NetGalley, Macmillan Children's Publishing Group, and Feiwel & Friends provided me an advance copy of the book in exchange for an unbiased review.

It's also a heartwarming story about friendship and love. The first-person narrator is 15-year-old Flynn whose girlfriend, January, goes missing. Under scrutiny because, as her boyfriend, he surely must know more than he admits to the police, Flynn starts to look into January's disappearance himself and discovers that he didn't know his girlfriend as well as he thought. January had recently moved to a prestigious new school after her mother married a rich guy with political aspirations. Feeling alienated in her new environment, January had become increasingly distant. Debut author Caleb Roehrig quite skillfully combines two storylines: the mystery of what happened to January and Flynn's story of learning to be true to himself. I enjoyed this. Flynn was a very likable character and I enjoyed his interactions with his supportive parents and with his peers, in particular with Kaz. The mystery element of the story kept me guessing right to the end. This was generally well written, but in parts the author over-explained and sometimes Flynn's choice of vocabulary didn't seem authentic for a teenage boy. Well, at least I don't know any that could use words of that caliber in everyday speech. However, Flynn's path to self-acceptance and being comfortable in his own skin was portrayed in a realistic and certainly poignant manner.Overall, this was a good mix of suspense with Flynn becoming a determined amateur sleuth and emotional storytelling as Flynn's life changes when he reveals his true self.

I really liked Flynn and his development. He started out as a fairly typical teenager, and it is only when his girlfriend, January, goes missing that he begins to reveal more about himself and his inner life. For me books can be really memorable when their characters are well done, even if the story falls a little flat, but Flynn was the only character I really connected with, so I don't know how long this story will stick in my mind, unfortunately. Which brings me to the not so great...The story was quite predictable, which may be because I read a slightly ridiculous amount of crime fiction (for someone with a rather mellow temperament;-) In any case, I never felt hooked by the plot, which was disappointing. I also felt there was a distinct lack of police presence and it felt fairly unrealistic that a teenage boy would solve the mystery before they did, because it wouldn't have taken much.The writing also felt a little tedious at time, even though I think Roehrig is a good writer. I just felt the text was so bogged down with similes and metaphors, it seemed very unlikely that a boy like Flynn would think like that - not that teenagers can't have eloquent thoughts - but simply because it often felt odd given the stressful circumstances of the story.I don't want it to sound as if this book was awful, because it definitely wasn't. It was simply a bit disappointing, because I had heard such good things. I would be curious in Roehrig's future work, especially if he wrote a novel from the perspective of an adult, to which his language might be better suited.Find more reviews and bookish fun at http://www.princessandpen.com"}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "(Source: I received a digital copy of this book for free on a read-to-review basis.

I loved the premise (a thriller starring a gay boy is like, the ideal combo of things for me), thought the cover was AMAZING, and Caleb is super lovely on Twitter. So yeah, I was really, REALLY hyped to read this book. And then I started reading it, and holyfuckingshit. This book. To say it lived up to my massively high expectations is an understatement that doesn\u2019t do this phenomenal book justice: this spooky, cute and intense book is now one of my favourite books of all time. I can\u2019t stop thinking about it, and I already know I\u2019m going to read it again multiple times. It\u2019s seriously so perfect/addictive/amazing.It\u2019s complex. It\u2019s thrilling. It\u2019s got this Halloween/October-ey vibe to it that is so wonderful and so unique. It\u2019s got the scary/fun balance down to an art. I can honestly say I\u2019ve never read a book that feels like this one. It\u2019s like if you took what Halloween feels like: slightly scary, slightly thrilling, and a little bit edgy and dangerous, and made a book that feels like that. I have no idea how Roehrig captured this complex feeling in a novel, but I am so glad he did, because it\u2019s incredible. After reading, I can safely say that the cover for this is one of the best I\u2019ve ever seen. Looking at it, you really get a sense of the atmosphere. I know I\u2019m going on and on about the feel of this book, but I honestly love it so much I think it deserves it. LAST SEEN LEAVING has a style all of its own, which I think is worth getting hyped about. The characters in this are also so great, but I\u2019m worried about spoilers, so I\u2019ll just talk about our protagonist: Flynn. I love him. He\u2019s smart and funny and is so effortlessly charming. This book works because of how incredible and likeable he is. Also, Flynn is also one of the most believable gay boys I\u2019ve ever read, with very authentic struggles, fears and experiences. This book is #ownvoices, and it really shines through here \u2013 not that non #ownvoices people can\u2019t write convincing gay boys (they totally can) but I feel like it\u2019s fair to say that this book being #ownvoices makes it extra special. AND THE ROMANCE IS LIKE WHOA. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say about that. But yeah, it\u2019s perfect. I could honestly rave about this book endlessly. It\u2019s definitely one of my favourite YA books of all time, and it\u2019s one that I\u2019m going to go back to time and time again."}, {"userName": "Elise (TheBookishActress)", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52545435-elise-thebookishactress", "userReview": "Actual Rating: 3.5 stars. First, let me give some credit: this book was really hard to put down. The first half has a fabulous mood. I distrusted everyone, including January. There was no way of knowing who was lying about what January had said. I even questioned the main narrator's motivations!! I suspected every single character in the mystery to some degree. So for the first half, I was really feeling the potential of the mystery. That aspect, unfortunately, let me down. I really love when mystery books don't rely on red herrings, but show that many different characters did many different shady things. I hate when all the villainy is on one character, and I felt that happened too much here. The ending was a little underwhelming. There are one or two interesting plot twists, but nothing that turned me into a sobbing mess at 2 am. And 2 am me turns into a sobbing mess at everything. There's nothing bad about this mystery, just nothing particularly fabulous or standout either. There's another interesting aspect of this book I wanted to talk through. This is a coming of age about sexuality as well as a mystery. I really liked the coming-age-aspect; that being said, it wasn't anything I hadn't read before. I do really appreciate the existence of lgbtq characters in genre fiction, as I'm sure none of you will be surprised by, and I enjoyed the interactions between main character Flynn and his love interest, Kaz. They made a sweet couple. VERDICT: A terrifying first half led to a lukewarm second half and ending, but this was still a ton of fun to read, incorporating both coming-of-age and mystery. Not shockingly good, but a solid read.

A headstrong girl caught between the comfort of her past and the feeling of not belonging in her present life, her story would change with her audience, craving compassion, a chance to be the center of attention or just to feel alive and cared for. Now missing, the clues point to her having been abducted and killed, but there is no body.Flynn has been January\u2019s boyfriend for several months, but now that her mother has married a powerful politician, she must bow to appearances and be the perfect puppet, seen and not heard. Their last meeting together didn\u2019t go well, and they break up, but Flynn senses there is more going on with January and he may just be right. Impatient with the lack of progress in her case, Flynn takes it on himself to investigate. What he discovers is that people are not as they always appear, including himself.Caleb Roehrig\u2019s Last Seen Leaving goes beyond a young man\u2019s search for answers to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s disappearance. Flynn has his own secrets and finally comes to terms with letting the world know, if only to save himself from becoming an even stronger person of interest. As the lies both he and January have hid behind are uncovered, Flynn admits the biggest secret of all, he is gay.Filled with tension, and pain of loss and the fear of discovery, Caleb Roehrig\u2019s Last Seen Leaving is an emotional tale of the types of pain people hide within and how far they will go to escape that pain. For Caleb, coming clean about his sexuality lifts the weight he has carried and gives him a sense of peace and self-respect. His hunt for January is an eye-opening experience about life, love and the need for simple human kindness. A wonderfully told tale that is both heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time.I received an ARC edition from Feiwel & Friends in exchange for my honest review.Publisher: Feiwel & Friends (October 4, 2016)Publication Date: October 4, 2016ISBN-10: 1250085632ISBN-13: 978-1250085634Genre: YA FictionHardcover: 336 pagesAvailable from: Amazon | Barnes & NobleFor Reviews & More: http://tometender.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Jill", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37692443-jill", "userReview": "*3.75Holy Criminal Minds... I enjoyed this book! When I first started reading it, I was getting serious Gone Girl vibes. Like it felt almost identical. But, as it went on, it started to change to more of a twisted story that I'm pretty sure I've seen on Criminal Minds a few times. So, it wasn't the most original thing in the whole world. Now don't get me wrong, I really enjoy Criminal Minds. I watch it all the time. So I still thought this book was suspenseful and creepy af and enjoyable. I think I would give this aspect of the story 2.5/3 stars because I was really engaged (like I finished it in like a day and a half), but it was a bit predictable and not very original.However, as a coming of age/LGBTQ+ story. I would give it maybe a 4/4.5 star. I thought this aspect of the story was done beautifully and I enjoyed it way more than the actual thriller part of it. I really loved that this self discovery aspect was set against this mystery/thriller background. I thought that was pretty unique. If it was just the coming of age part, it might have been not exciting on it's own, but combined with the suspense of a murder mystery story, it was amazing. (I ADORE KAZ *flail).

So while many were pitching this as a YA Gone Girl I really had nothing to compare to as I haven\u2019t read Gone Girl yet.Last Seen Leaving starts off with such a descriptive paragraph that had me instantly hooked and intrigued. Right away we start off finding out January missing (this isn\u2019t a spoiler, it\u2019s in the synopsis) and Flynn\u2019s journey for answer and solving her disappearance begins. With trying to piece together what happened to January, Flynn learns that she had a lot of secrets. However, January isn\u2019t the only one with secrets.The whole book is from Flynn\u2019s POV which I found was realistic, relatable, and humours. From the start I really liked Flynn\u2019s character, his journey of self discovery and character growth is what really made me love this story. Caleb Roehrig did a fantastic job bringing Flynn\u2019s character to life and making his voice stand out. While trying to piece together January\u2019s disappearance Flynn is also reflecting on his life and the secret he\u2019s keeping.There was also a great selection of secondary characters.- Kaz, I won\u2019t say much because I don\u2019t want to spoil anything\u2026but OMG I LOVED KAZ!! I only wish this book was a little bit longer so that there was more Kaz time.- Micah, Flynn\u2019s best friend since they were 2 years old. I felt like Micah\u2019s reaction and acceptance to what was going on with Flynn was realistic and a great approach.- Tiana, Micah\u2019s girlfriend, Flynn\u2019s friend, January\u2019s best friend. I like that Flynn had Tiana\u2019s support and there conversations about January. Since Tiana and January were best friends their connection and thoughts of what happened to her were interested for readers to observe.Last Seen Leaving had a great plot layout and a strong pace. Although, I couldn\u2019t help but feel like it fell into that rut or what I like to call middle of the book syndrome. The first half was great and kept my attention but then I felt like there were filler pages (four chapters) with things were being drawn out. But it picked right back up and I couldn\u2019t tear myself away from this book.Would I recommend Last Seen Leaving? I imagine that if you\u2019ve read Gone Girl, or maybe you\u2019re a fan of mystery/suspense books then you\u2019ll enjoy Last Seen Leaving.

Filled with SAT vocabulary no teen would utter, Caleb Roehrig's overuse of adjectives, adverbs and metaphors made for a clunky read and slow pace. Roehrig also told when he could have shown and over-explained the obvious. Plot wise, the mystery of January's disappearance and presumed death didn't feel unique, with the exception of Flynn, the other characters were one dimensional, often stereotypes. I did think Flynn's parents were well written, supportive and concerned which is often missing in YA lit. Roehrig did a nice job including diversity of race, class and sexual orientation into the story in a seamless manner. LAST SEEN LEAVING is an implausible story, which wouldn't have bothered me if it was better written or had held my interest.THEMES: friendship, romance, LGBT, mystery, suspense, rape, family, parents, stepfamiliesI was given a free e-copy of LAST SEEN LEAVING in exchange for my honest review. I think this novel will have an audience, but I hesitate to recommend due to the writing."}, {"userName": "Celeste_pewter", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16386248-celeste-pewter", "userReview": "Review to come.

It is true that we're talking about a 3 to 5 year difference (we know that the college age character is \"not 21 yet\"), but there's a pronounced gap between the two characters.

I am scratching my head that more people aren\u2019t talking about it. It is so good! I admit it started off slow. In fact at first I didn\u2019t think I liked the characters very much. I kept reading though and slowly I found myself thinking a lot about Flynn, wondering what happened next, and then counting the minutes until I could get back to his story. This is Flynn\u2019s story, it just happens to have started right after his girlfriend went missing.January has gone missing. Flynn is her boyfriend and one of the first people interviewed by the police. When did he last see her? Over a week ago. What was she like, what was her emotional state? Actually, they got into a disagreement because she wanted to have sex and they kinda broke-up. Telling the truth about January means revealing the truth about Flynn. What if you missed all the signs and were the only person that could have saved her? This is Flynn\u2019s story.This story starts with a missing January and a confused Flynn. He has literally no idea where she could be. As we learn more and more about January it becomes clear that she was troubled. She only started dating Flynn a few months ago and lately she has been distant. She changed schools and moved into a better neighborhood. Since her mom is now married to a senator candidate, she is moving up in life. She tells Flynn she hates it there. But does she?I felt bad for Flynn. Admittedly he wasn\u2019t a good boyfriend, but he has a good reason for that. Not to mention that January kinda pushed him away. It sucks that all he has is what she told him. He is left to try to figure out what might have happened to her. When the cops start looking at him like he might be a suspect he is forced to reveal a hard truth about himself. A secret he has been trying so hard to deny, but it is the only thing that can free him from suspicion.This story is full of tension. As Flynn sets out to find out what may have happened to January, he was also full of regret at how things were handled between him and January. There is also a healthy amount of fear on Flynn\u2019s part to being found out. I loved the interjection of Kaz, January\u2019s former co-worker, into Flynn\u2019s world. It seems he came along right at the right time and I felt giddy reading their interactions.The only thing negative I can say is that the last few chapters and the wrapping up of \u201cwho done it\u201d I kinda lost focus. Was it me or did the writing wane? I honestly don\u2019t know. I can tell you that I didn\u2019t really care who did it all that much because ultimately this was Flynn\u2019s story. And it is a good one. This book had me feeling all kinds of emotions. I did cry a few tears and I might have squealed at some point with glee. I left this story feeling better about the world."}, {"userName": "Mia Siegert", "userReviewDate": "Jan 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5883288-mia-siegert", "userReview": "I was thrilled to get in line early enough to get an ARC of LAST SEEN LEAVING, signed by Caleb Roehrig.It's going to take me awhile to fully formulate my thoughts on this exciting, fast-paced thriller, and I suspect I'm also going to make some video where I'll fumble over everything in trying to explain just how good this book was. It was such a fast read, I got through it in two sittings--one on the airplane back from BEA (couldn't wait to tear into this) and one just now when I should realistically be grading (I'm getting to it!).This is not for those who are light-hearted, the book is gruesome. There's violence, there are creepers, there are awful and unimaginable things happening to awful people. The realistic yet unresolved ending doesn't give way to a happy ending that many readers crave (though one could easily argue the epilogue satisfied that), however the decision to just \"go there\" was right and exactly what the text needed. I can't emphasize how much I appreciated his boldness to do what NEEDED to be done. Flynn is a fast from perfect character, and Roehrig captures and explores the fears and confusions many closeted gay men feel, such as having feelings, INTENSE feelings, for a girl, liking them, then having some stuff change. With the insistence most of society puts on labels, I felt this was critical because people can't help who they like, or who they don't. Sometimes it doesn't fit in a box. Sometimes there's an exception.But then, Roehrig took it a step further by having Flynn, after having to admit his homosexuality to himself, continue to date January, who most certainly knew what was going on.They never talk about \"it.\" This \"it\" is there, something people are afraid to touch, like it's unsafe to say the word \"gay.\" Like it's a bad thing. Spectacular debut and such a chilling read. Bravo! I can't wait to read the next project."}, {"userName": "Holly ", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15273212-holly", "userReview": "Wow, this was REALLY good! And this is coming from someone who doesn't often find hits in the YA thriller genre. But yeah, I loved this, and the characters, Flynn and Kaz especially. CUTIES WHO HAD EACH OTHER'S BACKS. Their relationship was so lovely to watch unfold. Flynn was so scared to come out, but the people who love him handled it (mostly) well. I was so angry at his best friend, but they made up, and I had ALL THE FEELS. And his parents were the absolute best and present and gave Flynn a safe space to be himself without fear of judgment or shame. As for the storyline, the mystery of January's disappearance, I predicted some things, and others, I did not. It was intriguing, watching Flynn unravel January's life, because it wasn't what he thought it had been. I REALLY liked how Caleb tackled rape culture a bit here, and I did feel like I got to know January through everyone else, even the liar in her. While it wasn't a shiver-inducing type of thriller, the element of suspense was there. And I was super happy with the ending. I swear my eyes were a little watery after finishing this. Last Seen Leaving had my attention from the opening line all the way to the last sentence, and I will definitely be reading future Caleb Roehrig books."}], "description": "Flynn's girlfriend has disappeared.
