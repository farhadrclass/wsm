Looking at them on a case-by-case basis and often based on interviews with the players themselves, or the people who helped, he gets into the minute details of how each player made the choice to defect, and how they organised it and ultimately arrived. He also considers the wider scope of the issue by noting the political climate of both countries, and how it influenced each players. It is a really interesting book, and the inclusion of the various Czechoslovaks who defected really adds to it, as they are often downplayed or outright forgotten, or even ignored in favour just of the emergence of the Russians in the NHL."}, {"userName": "Brenn", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9260692-brenn", "userReview": "[I did have disappointments with the book in spots. Omissions were committed, some minor, some major. I would have liked Pavel Bure's story added, to give comparison to those who had the harder exodus. His trip to Disney Land was his path to the NHL, and it was allowed because of the successes of those who went before him. One major omission was recognizing that four Russians were on the NY Rangers team to win the Stanley Cup in 1994, not just two. He names Alexei Kovalev and Sergei Nemchinov, but Sergei Zubov is only mentioned in other parts of the book, and Alexander Karpostev was not named at all. Pinchevsky had a wealth of personal interviews to use for the book, which makes up for most of the omissions. The full chapter on Petr Nedved was a pleasant surprise, since Nedved usually is ignored by the hockey establishment, and Pinchevsky goes into the contract disputes that caused the bad feelings.

So, I suppose it's more of a 3.5 star book than 4 but we do have to round up around here.One can certainly only applaud the author for all the care he took in writing out the statistics of each player and describing their evolution and adaptation (or lack thereof) to the world of the NHL. Sometimes though I did not quite understand the logic in the order of the presentation of the players. For example in the chapter about the Russian players, I would have thought that Mogilny's defection should have come before the story of the Green Five, given that his coming to the NHL preceded theirs (and, in my opinion, was quite more impressive). The one point I do wish the author had spent more time on, although it would have probably taken a lot of research and possibly deep knowledge in social aspects of the USSR era, is the fate of those left behind the Iron Curtain. There are a few times where he mentions that the homes of the families were visited by officials and someone had lost their job following the defection of one of the players, but all that is really only mentioned in passing. All those social stories would be fascinating to read about! But perhaps they should be saved for another book that's less about hockey and more about the social impact of the players' decisions to leave their native countries during the Soviet era."}, {"userName": "Brent Venton", "userReviewDate": "Nov 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12826783-brent-venton", "userReview": "Well researched with a clear love for the subject matter Breakaway documents the Iron Curtain-busting exploits of the first waves of Eastern European hockey players to land in the NHL. From the first notable defectee, Vaclac Nedomansky, in the 70s down to the last in Canucks' biggest mistake Petr Nedved,Pinchevsky does an excellent job tracking down most of the key figures in what became a mini-industry of player smuggling. The book is more of an international spy thriller than a hockey story - detailing secret meetings in secluded woods, hikes across barbed borders and dodging KGB agents in glitzy hotels. All very exciting stuff for the reader as well the rumpled hockey executives turned secret agents who participated. The only thing holding this book back is Pinchevsky's somewhat limited prose whereas a writer like Red Fisher perhaps would have given the stories more of the romance and nostalgia that they are lacking. A must read for any NHL fan old enough to remember the Stastny brothers, Petr Klima's helmet, and the arrival of the famed Russian Five."}, {"userName": "Mary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 01, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5990274-mary", "userReview": "My rating system is as follows: 1 star = couldn't even finish it; 2 stars = read it, but couldn't wait for it to be over; 3 stars = enjoyed it; 4 stars = so good, I'm telling everyone to read it; 5 stars = mind blown, my life will never be the same. So far, only one book has ever earned all 5 stars; Watership Down. So for me to give Breakaway 4 stars means you should listen up!This book is not only interesting if you're a hockey fan, but also if you like history. Double bonus if you enjoy hockey history! As a hockey fan who loves to read about the sport, I knew a little about players defecting, but had never read in depth about how the whole thing went down. These stories are intense! The risk, the danger, the aftermath... I enjoyed every chapter. Hockey fans shouldn't miss this one."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6879982-richard", "userReview": "One of the best books on hockey I've read so far, right up there with the Game by Ken Dryden. Gives a very deep insight into the former Eastern Block players who risked everything to play in the NHL. From the first Czech dissidents Nedomansky and the Stastny brothers, right through the greatest Soviet players: Fetisov, Larionov, Fedorov. I really enjoyed their stories, especially of those players that I had the privilege to see such as the famous Red Army line of the Detroit Red Wings. It also gives a very good historical/social background to better understand their circumstances and decisions."}, {"userName": "Tomas Tomka", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10143587-tomas-tomka", "userReview": "Must read book for all hockey fanatics."}], "description": "From behind the Iron Curtain onto hockey's biggest stageThe incredible true story of the trailblazing men who risked everything to pass through the Iron Curtain and become NHL superstars, \"Breakaway\" is a thrilling look at the untold stories that changed hockey forever.
