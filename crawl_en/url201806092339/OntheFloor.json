And while my exposure to the roaring 80s was just a single summer job at Lehman, the legendary excess of those times informed my coming of age. But Aifric Campbell, despite knowing her milieu inside and out, doesn't deliver. Gerry is too sodden with tears and alcohol, so blindly (to us) weak and manipulated, we are sick of her long before she is sick of herself and also can't fathom how she ever became a star...only her decline, and not her talent or her success, makes sense. The ending is merely tacked on. No real development - just an inexplicable change of scene. What's next for Geri? Silicon valley? Anyway, the story of those early lonely female masters of the universe remains to be written."}, {"userName": "Kelsea", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13988402-kelsea", "userReview": "I\u2019m honestly a little surprised that this currently has a 2.85 rating. I know I\u2019m only giving it a three, but I tend to rate more harshly than Goodreads. Perhaps it was the hype surrounding this book that led to such disappointment in other readers? I didn\u2019t have any expectations going in.Since I read this a few months ago, my memory isn\u2019t the freshest, but I think I remember enough to give it a short (a relative term for me) review. Other reviewers already offer a nice plot overview, so I\u2019m just going to add my opinion.Yes, Geri is absolutely as depressed, pathetic, and weak throughout the book as the other reviewers say. She makes it impossible for the reader or any characters in the novel to respect her. Yet\u2026 while this is just me forming a possible conclusion about the writer\u2019s intent (a slippery slope), I don\u2019t think we\u2019re intended to particularly like or respect her. She can\u2019t see how everyone else sees her because she\u2019s too drowned in her own sorrows to be able to comprehend what she has become, let alone to care. That, to me, seemed like the whole point of the culminating scene. I\u2019m writing vaguely and don\u2019t consider this a spoiler, but I\u2019ll put it a few lines down for anyone sensitive to it.Geri can\u2019t be introspective when she\u2019s that blinded by pain. She has to get to the point where (who she considers) the lowest of the low has no respect for her (in an albeit, very odd scene) before she can start to understand what she has become.And that\u2019s why I don\u2019t think you\u2019re supposed to pity her. Everyone but Geri can see that she\u2019s beyond pitiful. And it is hard to read about a character dragging herself through life by barely a thread of hope, especially when it\u2019s from her perspective. We're as frustrated and annoyed by her pain as everyone around her. Yet, somehow, for some reason, a part of me is rooting for her. In a world where emotion is a liability, she dares to allow others to see her vulnerability, if only because she\u2019s past desperate and past caring. She falls so easily that conquering her is hardly a victory and she doesn\u2019t even know when she\u2019s lost.Campbell put all the cards on the table up front \u2013 the title, with its clever double meaning, tells you exactly where Geri is, both professionally and personally.I also recall that part of what kept me attracted to the story was her intriguing ability - the reason she climbed the ranks in the first place.The (admittedly abrupt) ending definitely leaves open the possibility of a sequel, and I would be interested in reading it. I\u2019m giving On the Floor an optimistic three stars."}, {"userName": "Cath Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5152481-cath-murphy", "userReview": "I started this with loads of anticipation - Orange prize nommed, promising Irish writer and a subject (young financial trader struggles to hold her life together) that sounded fresh and original.Oh why do I listen to the hype? It wasn't the writing that let this book down - Campbell is skillful enough - it's not the premise, it's the handling of the premise.After a promising set up (broken love affair, sinister overseas client, bottles of vodka under the bed) the story just falls slowly apart as one tired literary cliche (for example there's a Tragedy In Her Past - who would have thunk it?) after another rears its weary head. The overall effect was to alienate me from the MC. Instead of feeling sorry for her, I ended up wanting to give her a good shake. Not quite the effect Campbell was after.And it's a shame, because with more attention to the plot and a stout resolve to avoid the obvious, Campbell is a good enough writer to compete with some of the best (Atwood, Mantel et al)."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7637016-rose", "userReview": "Although this was longlisted for the Orange Prize, I found it disappointing. The writing style was a bit flowery for me, but having said that Aifric did manage to capture the macho willy waving of the City, a world she clearly knows well, and some of the descriptions were excellent. However, overall the plot was insubstantial and clunky, and as for Geri, well you had to wonder how someone so weak and gullible got to her exalted position in the first place.

She is gutsy, fierce, and happens to be the only trader that one of the richest investors in Hong Kong will speak to. She's also recovering from a horrible breakup and is facing having to move to China to appease her top client.Campbell clearly knows her topic and writes about the life and energy of an investment bank with an expert hand. It's a new world to me, and that's one of my favorite things about reading books -- being immersed in a new world. As someone who's been through some crappy breakups (haven't we all?), I'm a bit envious of how well she captures the feelings that go along with that. She's excellent at describing physical reactions to emotion:I felt a lurch somewhere below my ribs and a dizzying drop in temperature as if warm fluids were being drained from my body and replaced by formaldehyde chill.This is something I constantly try to achieve, but my characters all seem to feel their feels the same way, with twists to the chest or the gut. So, respect.On the Floor had some great moments, snappy dialogue, interesting characters, and surprising plot points. I would say the last third of the book is actually very powerful, with a back story coming out that I wished would have been more prevalent in the beginning of the book.However, there was one main problem I had with it: it was such a heavy-hearted book. The lightest part of it took place in the last few pages. Geri is depressed and heartsick for the entire novel, abused both emotionally and professionally by the men she's surrounded by. While this is likely accurate for the time period (the early '90s), it makes for kind of a bummer of a read.Certainly not a bad book, but as a reader, I almost cared too much for Geri, got frustrated for her as I would for a friend who was wallowing in misery after a rough breakup. The book is about so much more than her failed relationship, but at the end of the day, that's the part that really stuck out for me, and it was difficult to let go in order to see all the other great points about it."}, {"userName": "Rachelle Ayala", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6790432-rachelle-ayala", "userReview": "The author does a fantastic job of painting the investment banking scene from a female point of view. Unfortunately, the protagonist, Geri Molloy, is in over her head. Despite a talent for mathematics, which she hides, she is kept by her company because a major client in Hong Kong happens to like her and will only deal with her firm through her. This recluse, Felix, appears to play the role of a fairy godfather. He has a paternalistic relationship to Geri and gives her Yoda like guidance, reading from Kant or Descartes, and generally keeps her around as a plaything or curiosity.Meanwhile Geri is a puppet on the string of her bosses, and betrayed by everyone around, especially her slimey ex-boyfriend who takes advantage of her at every turn. After Geri screws up the deal, she goes AWOL in a surreal scene that could have come out of a Stephen King book. We find a lot of gory and sad backstory. Geri is told to snap out of it, and takes up Felix's offer to keep her job by moving to Hong Kong.The ending is unresolved. I think it is supposed to show that she has finally grown up, but somehow I see her as still dancing to strings, this time Felix's. There is a enigma at the very end, and the reader is left wondering which ticket she chooses.Geri is a hard protagonist to follow. She oftentimes delves into backstory as if it were happening in the moment. There are some great scenes of drinking too much and misjudging her surroundings, who she is with and what she should or should not be talking about. I find it hard to believe that Geri, as written, would have ever been seen as a rising star. I did not get the feeling she was that competent. All I saw was that Felix for some reason liked her and his influence kept her in good graces with her employer.Meanwhile, her despicable ex-boyfriend is the epitome of wall street jerk, and her ex-best friend, Zanna, the ultimate backstabber. There were no likeable characters in this story other than Rex, Geri's dog who has a happy ending.As literary fiction, it has great description and sets a somber mood, and therefore I don't expect a plot with the crisp pacing of genre fiction."}, {"userName": "Ligra Nera", "userReviewDate": "Feb 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34868622-ligra-nera", "userReview": "\u0160ios knygos autor\u0117 pati yra dirbusi banke, tod\u0117l puikiai i\u0161mano finans\u0173 pasaulio gudrybes.

Geri has been abandoned by her lover and is in the throes of heartbreak, trying to perform under pressure and fighting her natural urge to crumble and fall apart. Geri has caught the eye of one of the financial world's biggest fishes. Felix, something of an eccentric recluse who lives in Hong Kong, is attracted (in a purely platonic way) by Geri's natural talent for mathematics and refuses to trade with anyone else at her firm. So when a big deal comes up involving a company he holds controlling interest in, only Geri is in a position to get the information her bosses need to make millions. Her job, naturally, is on the line.I was afraid this novel would be hard to follow for someone like myself who knows nothing about stocks, shares and economics, but it was surprisingly accessible. It took me a little while to get into, but I soon found myself quite engrossed as poor Geri gets pushed from pillar to post by employers, colleagues and her cold-hearted ex. Geri was a sympathetic and well-rounded character, particularly in the second half of the novel once we learn about her background and what makes her tick. Felix is an enigma, but that's his function, and the character of Pie Man, a maths wizard who's employed to design a revolutionary new kind of economics software, was intriguing and just the right amount of creepy. Special mention goes to Rex, Geri's lovable retriever, who added heart to a novel that could easily have become a little clinical. Peripheral characters are more stereotypical, and there are plenty of male chauvanist, hard drinking swaggerers to populate the trading floor.There's an surprising turn of events towards the end of the novel which edges the book into thriller territory. It was an interesting diversion, but I'm not sure it completely worked. However, overall I found On The Floor remarkably absorbing, and I'd definitely read more books by Aifric Campbell."}, {"userName": "Gloria Feit", "userReviewDate": "Dec 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6469333-gloria-feit", "userReview": "This novel, written by an author with substantial background in the securities industry, flits between the hard-nosed life of a floor trader with a unique talent, a female in the midst of macho men, and a lovelorn female, torn between living up to her talent and a yearning for an ex-lover. And she has to choose, by the end of the book, between capitalizing on her abilities and going off in some new direction.Geri Molloy, 28 years old and with little or no training or education, lands a job on the trading floor in the London operation of a U.S. investment bank. She quickly becomes the largest producer and lands an enormous Hong Kong mutual fund manager as her main client. He wishes her to locate to Asia where he can interact with her. Presumably he is fascinated with her personality, and wishes to observe her more closely. Her dilemma is whether to make a new home in Hong Kong, remain in London hoping for reconciliation with her ex, or even use her mathematical talent to go off in a new direction as a quantitative analyst. Such is the plot.There are times when the dialogue reflects the frenzy and excitement of the trading floor. But more often than not, the descriptions appear to be manufactured to fill the space in between the times that Geri gets drunk or feels sorry for herself. Too much of the novel seems formulaic, and it can\u2019t make up its mind what it wants to be when it grows up.

I was immediately drawn to Geri as a character. She lives large, plays hard, and works hard. It's clear she can't keep up the pace, but I was looking forward to the journey. While there was much I liked in this novel, the pacing was uneven. Some parts were filled with suspense, while others were dragged down by detail.I particularly enjoyed Geri's observations (and premonitions) regarding the Gulf War. Knowing both the end of that war and the coming second Gulf War, there were some chilling scenes. It's a slippery slope when the reader knows more about the coming events than the characters. In On the Floor, it mostly worked, but at times the premonitions began to feel heavy handed.The verdict: A strong setting, intriguing characters and good writing gave this novel all of the elements of success, but together it never quite came together for me. Ultimately, I appreciated what Campbell was trying to tell with this complicated story and setting, but I think she lost focus in unnecessary details too often to truly succeed.Rating: 3.5 out of 5"}, {"userName": "Chaundra", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/123663-chaundra", "userReview": "This is another one for which I wish you could give half stars - two is probably overly harsh and it isn't quite good enough for three.I started this book with rather low expectations, but was intrigued by the concept - a woman in high finance in the 1990s and written by a woman. Something I have some personal experience of, though in the present day. As some of the other reviewers have noted, Ms. Campbell really knows her stuff and gets a lot of the details right.

However, what transpires is really a story of a very sad female individual who allows herself to be used and abused in many ways. In fact, it's a whole cast of unpleasant characters.

For five years Geri has had it all, but in the months leading up to the outbreak of the Gulf War in 1991, her life starts to unravel.
