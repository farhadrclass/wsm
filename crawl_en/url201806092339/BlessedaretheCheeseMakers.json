Sweet story."}, {"userName": "Dorothyanne Brown", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4429019-dorothyanne-brown", "userReview": "To give full context, I'm in the middle of a move, tied up with family concerns, and otherwise surviving the end of a particularly nasty winter. I kept this book out of the packed file because I planned to read it and leave it behind. Within the first few pages, I realized that there was no way I could do that. I have to keep this sweet, loveable book nearby. The magical cheese farm of the Josephs Corrigan and Feehan, with its gaggle of singing pregnant milkmaids and cows that milk best to the Sound of Music, the tales of how to make wonderful cheese, and the many many threads of lives that have been tangled together made me smile, weep, and laugh out loud. I fell in love at the first description of the Princess Grace cheese, languishing in a fridge somewhere and gradually getting more annoyed (and smelly); I smiled with recognition at the earnest husband doing \"good works\" in a perfectly fine island community for the sole purpose of self-aggrandizement; I loved the townspeople and their antics and stories; I cheered as each character came into their own.It's not a complex story, but it is laced with wisdom, running like a fine line of blue through a cheese. Parts of it have the slightly cheeky smell of a good Stilton. Parts of it glide down the throat like a creamy Brie. All of it fills the heart.Key thing is, I ended it with a smile on my face, a tear in my eye, a hunger for some really good cheese, and a strong desire to go to Ireland. Or in some way, to head towards where I feel is home.Loved it.And I've got to say the title is one of the best I've seen."}, {"userName": "CMT325", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/617853-cmt325", "userReview": "Cheese lovers, unite! I eat cheese everyday, so the title drew me in. One thing I found charming was how, in the beginning, the cheese was personified as an angry female who was offended at being left in the fridge to rot. This is just one of the odd/fun ways of writing in Lynch's novel. Another neat thing were the \"quotes\" on the art of cheesemaking. For example, I never thought about how good cheese needs to come from good grass(the cow's food) ... and even the rain, sun, and time effect the cheese. This just made cheese seem like ... poetry.Abbey is the granddaughter of a man who is half of a pair of the world's greatest cheesemakers. When she leaves her husband for his wrongdoings, she decides to find her long-lost grandfather and find out the truth of her past, since she can no longer trust anyone else.Meanwhile, a man named Kit is watching his life crumble around him as he struggles to get over the loss of his wife and their unborn baby. He too ends up turning up at the cheesefactory for salvation.Corrie and Fee need to find the perfect cheesemakers to take over before it's too late. Their factory is a unique place, where a cat named Jesus doesn't want to be a mother, and vegetarian pregnant milkmaids milk cows to \"The Sound of Music.\"At first, I found the book predictable, but sweet. I was also a bit impatient, because by page 150, neither Kit nor Abbey had made it to the factory. After that, everything went quickly. However, the book had several big surprises in store, and that made up for it.I think I'll go have some cheese."}, {"userName": "Eva", "userReviewDate": "Oct 28, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/313849-eva", "userReview": "This book reminded me of a Maeve Binchy novel. It is a tender tale of redemption and second chances. Deep in County Cork, Joseph Corrigan (Corry) and Joseph Feehan (Fee) make small batches of world famous cheese. Their two families have worked together for many generations, one family providing the milk and the other, the cheese making genius. When we first meet the old boys, they are interviewing for a new dairymaid. Her qualifications must be that she can carry a tune, has short fingernails, and is a vegetarian.Meanwhile in NY, a hot-shot investment broker named Kit Stevens has crashed and burned after the death of his wife. Spending too much of his time in a drug and alcohol induced fog, he gets fired and evicted on the same day. His personal assistant sends him to the farm in Cork to pull himself together.And across the globe, on the tiny island of Ate-Ate, Corry's granddaughter, Abbey, discovers her increasingly distant and unlikeable husband has been consorting with the village women. She leaves him to return home to Ireland.Lynch's novel is peppered with cheese making lore from Corry and Fee. Her prose is witty and wry, sometimes even laugh out loud funny. When I read, \"She hated it when reality reached out and snapped her thong.\", I spit tea out my nose. I think fans of Binchy would enjoy it tremendously. I intend to read the rest of Lynch's books."}, {"userName": "Erinn", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1005024-erinn", "userReview": "So worth reading, I can't tell you !Every now and then I think to myself 'I wish I were a cheesemaker...' Quirky tale of the love inherent in making good cheese and the redemption and reclamation of young women gone 'awry'.Perhaps it doesn't deserve a 5 star, but I give it that because of the delightful old men that put their love and patience and energy into ripening their cheese...Laugh out loud funny. Sweet and memorable, the taste lingers in my memory still."}, {"userName": "Martha", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/863487-martha", "userReview": "If I could give it 2 and 1/2 stars, I would. Not particularly well-written or all that funny. It was cute. By no means was it a deep and thoughtful romance. It was on the level with Danielle Steele novels (both in story content and complexity of read) versus Anita Shreve. I give it 3 stars because it's fun, quick and perfect for the summer. Those of you who have read my reviews know that I am totally into mindless \"chick-lit\" right now and this was perfect for me with one personal exception which did not influence my rating of this book. I read the book over Memorial Day weekend. Spoiler alert: There are a lot of pregnant teenagers, called the \"pregnasaurs\" (cute, no?) and the main character has fertility issues. Totally my prejudice because of my issues right now."}, {"userName": "Barbara", "userReviewDate": "Jul 24, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2107007-barbara", "userReview": "When I started this book, I thought it was a cute, easy summer read.

Corrie and Fee are the elderly cheesemakers, who are desperate to find the next generation before it is too late. Their operation is a labor of love, with many quirks, including pregnant, vegetarian milkmaids who milk to the Sound of Music. Abbey is the granddaughter who was taken away from the farm by her mother, and after marrying at a young age, she lives on a Pacific Island with her husband who is obsessed with irrigation. When she finds out that he has been \"irrigating\" other pastures after he found out she cannot have children, she is horrified and leaves with a friend to return to the U.K. and find her family. The third part involves Kit, a stockbroker whose life has devolved after the death of his wife and unborn baby. His assistant sends him off to Ireland to dry out and get sober. Kit unwittingly is drawn into the contest for the cheesemaker position and meets Abbey. They must find out if they have the touch to make a cheese worthy of Corrie and Fee. The cheese has a life and power of its own in the story and lends a charming taste of magical realism to the tale. The story has lots of humor including a pregnant cat called Jesus and other delightful quirks."}, {"userName": "Annalisa", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18726199-annalisa", "userReview": "This was an extremely amusing audiobook. I loved the narrator, Heather O'Neill, she had so many different voices and accents that were at times funny and at times serious. I don't know if they were necessarily authentic but I really enjoyed listening.The book started out in three different locations Ireland, New York City, and the Pacific Island Ate'ate, but converges on the Coolarney cheese factory in Ireland. This is not a story for those who are offended by language, fecking (Irish pronunciation) is one Corrie and Fee's favorite words. It took a little time to get used to this but really made the story more authentic in my opinion. This is a humorous story that deals with difficult characters and emotions in a way that doesn't end up depressing.As suggested by the title cheese plays a really big role in this novel and is at times almost magical. The cheese was a really nice touch and I really enjoyed listening to the process of making cheese, although I myself would not want to make cheese it gave me an appreciation of cheese making.This is a story worth listening to as an audiobook as the narrator is excellent and one would never get all the different accents in their own head."}, {"userName": "Jamie Erin", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8618881-jamie-erin", "userReview": "Blessed Are the Cheesemakers is a fun, cozy read. It\u2019s very easy to get into, and has many likeable characters. Set primarily in Ireland, the story has elements of magical realism, such as an old cheesemaker with the ability to see into the future, and cheeses with magical attributes. I really enjoyed the narrator\u2019s voice. You can almost hear a warm smile in her words as she unfolds the story. Although this book addresses some heavy issues (such as alcoholism, adultery and even death), there is a sweet optimism apparent in the narrator\u2019s descriptions that helps make this a truly enjoyable read.One of the reviews on the front of my copy notes that this is a \u201ctender love story...in the spirit of Chocolat.\u201d Yes, there is a wonderful love story that unfolds during the course of this novel, but I feel that this book was much more enjoyable than Chocolat, whose characters I didn\u2019t find nearly as dear or appealing as those in Blessed Are the Cheesemakers."}, {"userName": "Momruns5", "userReviewDate": "Oct 13, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1396453-momruns5", "userReview": "Really good fast read. Not a deep thinking book, but a really sweet and surprisingly funny romance, but not just a romance and not a sickingly sweet romance. I laughed out loud a few times. Fee was my favorite character.

I think if I were British - or Irish - or Australian - or something - I would have given it another star. The colloquialisms kind of threw me for a loop -trying to figure out how we might say the same thing here in America. The idea - a dairy farm in Ireland that crafts sublime cheese made using milk gathered by pregnant vegetarian young women from cows all named Maria, and the characters including a psychic old man and a farm full of quirky characters- calls Alice Hoffman to mind even if the writing itself does not. It was predictable, yet magical and entertaining, as well.

I would have read it just for the way the dialogue is written in a blatant Irish accent. The relationship between the two cheesemakers and their little \"family\" is so tender.
