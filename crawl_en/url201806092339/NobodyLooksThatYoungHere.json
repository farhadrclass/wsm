Throughout the lackluster course of the storyline which spanned a few decades, the narrative had taken many voices. The lingering tale examined the daily, routine everyday challenges faced by the main characters throughout their ordinary humdrum lives. It was well written but not exactly a page-turner.My thanks to NetGalley and Guernica Editions for this ARC in exchange for an unbiased review."}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/68824468-mel", "userReview": "A fascinatingly quiet romp through a rural Canadian town outside of London, this short book of short stories are loosely tired together as characters repeat but through differing POVs. There were instant connections for me which I think is hard to accomplish with the brief space allotted in stories. Several were surprisingly dark but didn\u2019t focus much on those events which was wonderful in its truth\u2014 we are all well-rounded humans because of both the good and, especially, the bad things that occur in our lives.

The voices in each story ring absolutely true."}], "description": "\"You've always presumed there's a Highway 402, but as it's nowhere near Toronto you were never sure. No loss.\"This is Currie Township, Southwestern Ontario, where roads crumble, barns rot, jobs erode, marriages suffocate, and kids like Mike Carrion find themselves adrift in it all, scratching their way to adolescence before they either knuckle down or get out of here and never look back. Beginning with the Friday night car crash years before Mike was born, the 17 stories in \"NOBODY LOOKS THAT YOUNG HERE\" follow the Carrion family and Currie Township in Mike's words and those of his parents, friends, and others who've already left for the city, well aware of what becomes of the people who don't.", "title": "Nobody Looks That Young Here", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36601131-nobody-looks-that-young-here", "average": 4.0, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1510770658l/36601131.jpg", "reviews": 3, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/14815314.Daniel_Perry", "name": "Daniel  Perry"}], "type": [], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36601131-nobody-looks-that-young-here", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28139255-hamburger", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16694865-the-lion-and-the-aardvark", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15823936-cvc", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21845761-hearing-voices"]}
