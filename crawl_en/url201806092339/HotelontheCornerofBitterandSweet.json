It is historical fiction for the Nicholas Sparks set -- an emotionally heavy-handed novel that is well told, but not particularly well written. There are some diamonds in the rough, though: the historical aspects of the novel are very interesting; the relationships depicted in the book, while not always believable, are complex; and, the issues related to cultural identity and racial discrimination in the States during WWII are very well detailed. All in all, \"Hotel\" is a great story couched in an okay novel. Ford is a promising writer who, I feel, needs to trust his readers more. That is, he needs to let us feel without trying SO hard to manipulate those feelings."}, {"userName": "Nan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/754607-nan", "userReview": "Original review posted: Mar 19, 09I have to admit that I did not like this book. Mr. Ford is a decent writer, and while he did research 1942 fairly extensively, he did a crappy job portraying 1986. I was alive in '86. I was ten, in fact. While my memory of the time is going to be different than that of a 50 year old character, I wound up being very tired of the repeated anachronisms. In one paragraph--on page four of the book, I believe--the narrator tells the readers that the main character's son is seeing a grief counselor and participating in an Internet support group. In 1986, that sort of thing would have been highly unlikely. Further, in that same paragraph, he tells us the main character's deceased wife is buried in the same cemetary with Bruce and Brandon Lee--and this is seven years before Brandon's death.I'm not the kind of reader that gets easily annoyed by poor detail editing--but I am annoyed when sloppy research (or a failure to do any sort of research) leads to misrepresentations of the setting. I found this book to be very sloppy indeed.Edit posted: April 21, 2013After years of getting comments and feedback on this review, I will take the time to edit it for two important details. 1. Many of the errors that I found irritating were fixed in the paperback edition of the book. I would argue that this means that others also found the errors irritating that they were, indeed, errors.2. Ford replies to the internet issue as one of his FAQ replies on his website. He states: \"I'm afraid I have to reveal just how geeky I truly am. I was on Compuserve in 1984, with an old coupler modem like you saw in the movie Wargames. Back when you had to pay $100 to sign up and were charged by the hour. Just because most people weren't online then, doesn't mean no one was. Just the few, the proud, the computer geeks...\" You can see the comment here."}, {"userName": "Debra", "userReviewDate": "Dec 29, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5032725-debra", "userReview": "Set in Seattle during the Japanese internment during WW2. This book has a sweeping feel to it. It starts out slow - but not slow in the sense who feel like you are waiting for paint to dry - but slow in the \"This is really going somewhere\" kind of way. It does go somewhere by the way. Once the ball gets rolling, this book sweeps you up into the lives of two friends who made a promise to see each other again.The book begins as Henry Lee stands in front of the Panama Hotel. This hotel has been boarded up for years but a new owner has discovered something inside - the belongings of Japanese families. Their possessions that were left behind when they were rounded up and taken to internment camps. As he stands watching, a simple act happens...the owner opens up a Japanese parasol. This act takes him back. We have all experienced this. A scent, a food, a location, a sound can take us back to our youth, or to the home of a loved one. For Henry Lee, the open parasol takes him back to the 1940s. Henry is raised by a father who wants his Chinese son to be an \"American\" at all costs. Henry through a \"Scholarship\" is sent to school where the \"American/White\" kids ignore him. But there is one person who does not ignore him and that it a young Japanese girl named Keiko. They form a friendship. A type of young love if you will. Sweet and innocent. But then Keiko and her family are rounded up and she is whisked away.Henry wonders \"Is this her Parasol?\" Could more of her families belongings be inside? Can he come to terms with what happened so long ago? Can he rebuild her relationship with his son?I thought this book was really good. Such a great book club book. So many discussions to be had. There are elements of friendship, love, loss, betrayal, longing, guilt, loneliness, etc.See more of my reviews at www.openbookpost.com"}, {"userName": "Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Feb 24, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1405162-lynn", "userReview": "I loved this book, but I had one minor annoyance with it. The author had 4 anachronisms: the book is set (in part) in 1986, and yet the son is in an \"on-line\" grief support group, and used the internet to look up a lost friend, and there is talk twice about digital conversion of records to CDs.This book is told by a 50+ year old second generation Chinese-American. It is told in two different time periods, and flows back and forth between the 1940's to 1986 seemlessly. It is the story of a young chinese boy who is thrown together with a young japanese girl in Seattle during WW2. It is the story of their friendship/love, and also that of the other relationships that the boy has: his Chinese parents, a local black jazz musician, and later with his own son and son's fiance. Very well written, and very touching.It gave an interesting insight into the Chinese views of the war, along with the effects, and the aftermath, of the Japanese internment on the Seattle area."}, {"userName": "Jason Koivu", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1742824-jason-koivu", "userReview": "For me Jamie Ford's heralded, multiple award-winning Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet was an entirely luke warm reading experience from start to finish. The emotional heat that should have brewed within a story of this nature, considering the volatile subject matter, failed to materialize. I never tasted the venom of injustice as I should have. The details of Japanese internment in America during WWII was certainly interesting to read about, especially since I know so little about it. Seeing our country, a country founded on freedom, take it away from its own citizens is chilling. I just didn't feel the chill in Ford's words as much as I could and should have.Otherwise, it was a lovely story. A quaint and well-written love story indeed. I did have a hard time rooting for the romantic connection between these two children. They were just too young for me to think in those terms, and maybe it wasn't intended to be so intimate. Certainly their relationship is sweet and I felt myself pulling for them, but I was pulling with all the strength and enthusiasm I would if I were pitted in a game of tug-o-war against a two year old.Regardless of my less than perfect reading experience, I think this would be a great book for someone looking for a 20th century historical romance. Perhaps someone who likes YA romance and who doesn't mind it being set against a background of truth and terror for Japanese Americans during World War II."}, {"userName": "Ariella", "userReviewDate": "Nov 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/394051-ariella", "userReview": "Oy vey. I really did want to like this book. It sounded like the perfect book for my mood: Not too highfalutin or literary, but a good story I which I can immerse myself and escape to a different time and place.As I went on Goodreads a few days ago to add the book to my list of 'currently reading' however, I came across a number of really bad reviews. Disappointed, and somewhat deflated, I nevertheless read on trying to ignore the negativity, stay positive and try to like the story and get into the characters. Well, I got to page 67. And reviewers who gave bad reviews: you were right.My first suspicions about the writing came in one of the first chapters where one page after the other the paragraphs start the same way: Henry wasn't sure which was... Worse, (pg 27) and ... More .frustrating (pg 29). Which just led me thinking: Where was the editor here? I even read through this sentence on page 33: The sum total of Henry's Japanese friends happened to be a number that rhymed with hero.What?!? What kind of sentence is that? From an adult? Someone trying to evoke the feel of a Chinese immigrant to the US in the 1940's?! That kind of writing is a word that rhymes with spit.Another 30 pages into the book and I thought: why bother? The author clearly hasn't been able to capture my attention, I am not drawn into the story or the characters and while I really wasn't looking for prose of genius, the are minimum requirements of what I am willing to read. (Maybe this book would be better as an audio?)So I put down. I give it one star and a new title: Prose on the Precipice of Barfy and Saccharain"}, {"userName": "Florence (Lefty) MacIntosh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10856439-florence-lefty-macintosh", "userReview": "[ and their fate left unresolved.

Henry and Keiko are both just twelve years old when they become friends in 1942. Life is difficult for both of them. They face racism and prejudice on a daily basis and Henry's father does not approve of the friendship. After the devastation of Pearl Harbour, the US government decides to send all the people of Japanese decent to live in internment camps until the war is over. Henry and Keiko find themselves separated. I really loved this book! Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet is a beautiful, fascinating, tender and moving story from beginning to end. Like the title suggests, the story is such a bitter-sweet tale, heartbreaking at times and so warm and sweet in others. This novel is set during two time periods, the 1940's and 1986. I found both periods equally compelling to read about. It is incredibly rare to find a historical fiction novel about World War Two that isn't set in Europe! Before reading this book, I knew nothing about how badly the Japanese in America were treated during the war. I was quite shocked by this. I have to admit I cried a few times while reading this book!All the characters were vivid, well-developed and realistic. I really loved the characters of Henry, Keiko and Sheldon, and really cared about what happened to them. I've just got one gripe with the novel. I would have liked to know what happened in Keiko's life during the intervening years while they were apart. I found it really hard to put this novel down and I look forward to reading more from this author!Five Stars!"}, {"userName": "Susan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1310192-susan", "userReview": "I'm always a little behind the curve when it comes to reading blockbuster NYT bestsellers. I think a part of me resists because I love finding \"little\" books that deserve kudos and talking about them. But I had heard so many good things about THE HOTEL ON THE CORNER OF BITTER AND SWEET that I bought it, though I sat on it a while before I cracked it open to read. Once I did, I was hooked instantly by the wonderful character of Henry Lee, a 12-year-old boy in Seattle's Chinatown during the early years of America's involvement in WWII. Henry's relationship with Keiko, a Japanese girl at his otherwise white school, is frowned upon by his father (in fact, he doesn't even tell his parents about Keiko for a long time). I so enjoyed seeing the boy Henry was (in the 1940s) interspersed with more modern chapters (1980s) so I also viewed the man he became. A sweet and eye-opening tale about love and humanity during an uncivil era. Highly recommended for readers of all ages."}, {"userName": "Laura ", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1330867-laura", "userReview": "Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet by Jamie Ford, Release Date 1/27/2009, $24.00 I've just finished reading Jamie Ford's forthcoming novel, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, and am still basking in the glow. The characters are fully realized, the title is a real attention grabber, and the story fleshed out with plenty of local and period detail. Ford provides an intimate look at life on the homefront during WWII from the uncommon perpective of an earnest Chinese-American boy and his Japanese-American school friend. I think Henry and Keiko are two of the most engaging characters I've come across in a long while and I will not soon forget them, nor Sheldon, the saxophone player who befreinds them. I'm not the type of reader that necessarily longs for a happy ending, but this one certainly satisfies."}, {"userName": "\u0645\u0631\u062c\u0627\u0646 \u0645\u062d\u0645\u062f\u06cc", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1462696", "userReview": ":\u0646\u0627\u0645\u0647 \u0646\u0648\u06cc\u0633\u0646\u062f\u0647 \u0628\u0647 \u062e\u0648\u0627\u0646\u0646\u062f\u06af\u0627\u0646 \u0627\u06cc\u0631\u0627\u0646\u06ccDear friend,When I heard that my debut novel, Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, was going to be published in Persian, my first thought was, \u201cFantastic! Perhaps I could attend the Tehran Book Festival.\u201dYou see I would love to visit your country.I\u2019ve had friends travel to Iran in the past and they\u2019ve told me wonderful things\u2014about the history, the culture, and especially the kind and generous people.Also, whenever the leaders of my country say there\u2019s someplace Americans shouldn\u2019t go, I want to go there even more.Because I believe literature can, and should, transcend politics. And because I believe readers\u2014lovers of books, wherever they live, are the best kind of people\u2014curious and compassionate, creative and filled with boundless hope. I firmly believe that there is connectivity through storytelling. Or as the great poet, Hafez, once said, \u201cFound nothing more joyful than the sound of words of love.\u201dSo as a writer (and a reader) I\u2019m daydreaming about a better day, not too far into the future, when perhaps I can be there in person, to thank you for picking up my book\u2014a noble romantic tragedy, a recollection of a forgotten and somewhat shameful chapter in US history, and an innocent love story about people who are seemingly different, but really the same.Thank you to Tandis for publishing this book, and a special thank you to Marjan Mohammadi for her hard work and expertise in translating this story. I hope you enjoy my work and if so, I\u2019d love to hear from you.Kindest regards,Jamie FordP.S. Tehran Book Festival.

One of my favorite teachers in high school was sent to one of the internment camps as a child. I\u2019ve met Fred Korematsu, whose challenge to internship went all the way to the Supreme Court back in the day. I\u2019ve read that opinion. I know several members of the excellent legal team that got his conviction vacated. I know the Justice Department lied to the Supreme Court about the \u201cknown danger\u201d the Japanese-Americans represented. My grandmother bought a house on 10th and Jefferson from a neighbor being sent away, and my boss\u2019s family took in an ebony and ivory piano from neighbors being removed that he later, at no small expense, had restored and donated to a Buddhist temple in Wapato. I love George Takei and have exchanged tweets with him. I know about the internment camps. I am deeply ashamed. I am not the target audience. I am no fan of the sweet and sentimental; of pathos and wistfulness; of romance and thwarted love. And I despise Orson Scott Card, who helped get this book written, for his stalwart work on behalf of homophobia. Science fiction writers who are on the wrong side of history belong in the special hell. So I didn\u2019t like the book, but understand, seriously, I am not in the target audience. I suspect, though I don\u2019t know, that the author did not mean to write about the Japanese internment. He meant to write a thwarted love story. The author interview in the back of the book disclaims any political intent, which baffles me. Given the opportunity to clearly condemn \u2013 or even defend -- the internment, he evades. I don\u2019t get that. The most he can come up with is \"beloved president Reagan apologized.\" When asked if he saw a parallel between the calls to close the border or remove Muslim Americans, he seemed astonished that there might be one. I do not love President Reagan. The parallel is bleeding. If I hadn\u2019t been reading this for my reading group, I never would have picked it up. But I did, and I finished it. It\u2019s a quick read. It\u2019s about a guy who meets a girl, falls in love with a girl, loses a girl to the Japanese internment and his father\u2019s racism, and moves on to be a good husband to a different woman. Who dies. Opening up our guy to find his first love. I suspect it\u2019s one of those books that attempts to mine those \u201crich veins of ordinary life\u201d I hear that non-genre literature is lovingly mining.

You jump from 1986 to 1942 thoughout the story. To tell the tale of Henery Lee an intelligent, brave, 12yr old Chinese American quickly growing into a man thru struggling WWII times. He has a strained relationship with his father mirroring that as a grown man in his fiftys he also struggles to open communications with his own grown son Marty. This is a rare book find for me as a closer look into the Japanese and Chinese American citizens and the bigotry and hatred they endured, because the country thought any could be spies. I gained new insight about the internment camps all Japanese citizens were evacuateed to with only possessions they could carry. Was a powerful look into American history as hearts and humanity broke down, inflicted by war and the damage to repair years after as relationships try to mend.Not very many books have made me read thru tears but this was such a profound story that needed to be written, with characters believable and heroic. A Beautiful Romeo and Juliet style romantic tale. I loved the symbolisms used, most of which the old vinyl 78 Oscar Holden record.

So when I saw the audio at the library, I figured...what the heck, may as well try it! I might not have finished it if I had an alternative book in the car to read. Sometimes the reader annoyed me when he said the main character's (Henry's) words with a Chinese accent (inconsistently at that!) .... since Henry had been born in the US.I usually do not like when an author switches back and forth from one time period to another, but in this book it \"fit\".I think the author should have made Henry and Keiko a bit older...I found it impossible to accept that these \"children\" had such a relationship. Absolutely implausible. I also found the writing to be clumsy, full of cliches, AND I felt nothing for any of the characters. Usually I feel some connection, but not here.I found a LOT of inaccuracies in this book and many logical incongrities, but since I was driving while listening, I could not make notes on them...but I groaned a LOT! This author really needed to do better research or have an editor who knows something about history. One of the most egregious errors was when Henry's son was participating in an online grief group...in 1986!!!!! Also in 1986, a rear-projection TV in a nursing home, Someone died in 1986 but was buried in the same cemetery as a celebrity who died in 1993. He said that a Japanese sub DESTROYED an oil refinery in CA, when, in reality, it had barely damaged the refinery. Yeah, right, sure. Many online reviewers, who know a lot more about World War II than I do, really zoned in on all the the mistakes about the war. For example, Japan occupied Canton until 1945 (not 1942 as the author stated), To me, all of these errors of fact are the signs of a lazy writer. I know that with fiction, readers are expected to suspend belief, but not about FACTS!The author said, at the end, that he did not intend to make this book about the internment camps...but perhaps he should have put that statement at the beginning because I think maybe people were expecting that to be the focus of this book...Had this been a \"paper\" book, or if I had had another audiobook available, I probably would have abandoned it after 50 pages -- if I had even gotten that far!"}, {"userName": "K", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13779-k", "userReview": "No. Just, no.I had pretty much decided to abandon this book unfinished when I received notification that the audiobook I had requested from the library was now available for download.

But....a \"meh\" review it deserves, and that's what it shall get from me.First, the good: My sense is that this story has raised awareness of the internment camps that many Japanese-Americans were placed in during WWII. As someone who believes that without knowledge of history we're doomed to repeat it, I think that's timely and important knowledge for people to have. The story of Henry and Keiko's relationship is a very sweet, heartwarming one (if not entirely realistic at age 12-ish). Mrs. Beatty is a character who I would have enjoyed getting to \"know\" better; for someone who was a pretty crusty lady, she seemed to have a lot of compassion beneath that exterior.Then, the bad: Anachronisms. Lots of them. Interestingly, not in the 1940s sections, but in the 1980s sections. Shame on the editor who let them get past their desk. Another weakness was in all of the allusions to the history of father-son relationships in the Lee family with little being done to develop that theme. Also, while many of the characters were interesting, the portrayal of them felt superficial to me. Mrs. Beatty seemed underdeveloped as a character- as did Mr. Okabe and even Sheldon. I wanted more of these characters.It's an easy read and if you need something to fill time (I did- read it in a day and a half while I've been laid up with pneumonia), it's not a bad time-filler. Honestly, though, it reminds me of cotton candy at the fair- sweet, light, fluffy, and leaves you wishing for something with more substance."}, {"userName": "James Martin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2560775-james-martin", "userReview": "Great title and a great book!

O autor, Jamie Ford, alterna dois momentos distintos da hist\u00f3ria ao longo do livro: o passado, aquando da Segunda Guerra Mundial, e o presente, relativo ao ano de 1986, sendo que esta altern\u00e2ncia confere ritmo e aumenta, na minha perspectiva, o interesse na hist\u00f3ria, que remonta a um per\u00edodo algo conturbado da hist\u00f3ria mundial, da hist\u00f3ria norte-americana e da hist\u00f3ria japonesa.

Henry must come to grips with losing his new best friend while trying to understand why or how such an appalling act could be happening to the Japanese Americans.This book was certainly an eye opener as I already stated. I had heard of internment camps for the Japanese, but so very little of it. The author clearly stated at the end of this book he had no intention of laying blame on anyone or to sway the reader to sympathy either. He did a remarkable job of simply stating what happened with no political jabs. He tells a beautiful story of friendship and life during those difficult times. I can tell you this book has certainly inspired me to learn more on this topic."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7278451-maria", "userReview": "Gostei muito deste livro.

Perhaps it was the difficulty of being together that pushed them closer to each other... or perhaps the extreme circumstances of the time... but the depth of love was a little unbelievable.\u2022 Although the internet did exist in 1986, it's very hard to believe that Marty was in an online support group and used the internet to locate Keiko on the opposite side of the country. \u2022 Although CDs did exist and were used in 1986, it was hard to believe this would be the suggested form of reformatting a record instead of a cassette tape.

When my girlfriend found it on sale it put it on my list.Okay this is a do not pass up book, the reading is light goes quickly but the story is deep. I can't help but think of my very first real crush I had in the seventh grade, it my first attempt at understanding the very adult feeling I was having towards Tony. The funny thing is I can't tell you my husbands birthday but I can still remember the shirt Tony had on when he gave me my first kiss. Henry learns not only what it means to accept someone for who they are and love them despite all odds, he gives up speaking to his family and dishonoring his father to stand up for what he knows is right as an American. I can't think of a time period more confusing this one for a young chinese boy born in America. He learns what it means to be American from a young Japanese girl and also looses his heart in the process. This book has so many hidden chinese proverbs that will touch your heart and give you hope in that first love. If nothing else it took me back to a time in my own life that was bitter sweet."}, {"userName": "Crystal Craig", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729956-crystal-craig", "userReview": "Jamie Ford's, 'Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet' lived up to my expectations.

Going off-topic, why do so many adult children and their parents deny themselves honest reveals to each other when appropriate (if the relationship is benign and normal)? I never had kids, so as an outsider, I have seen SO many unnecessary parent/child/life dramas because of lack of communication! I suspect more families should get a mediator or a family therapist, if that is what it takes to TALK openly.

With Hotel on the Corner of Bitter and Sweet, Jamie Ford blends these two genres together and gives us a historical romance that I\u2019m delighted to say I enjoyed so much. I lived in this novel and when there were days when I just couldn\u2019t find the time to read, I found myself thinking of Henry and Keiko\u2026It is 1942. Twelve year old Henry Lee\u2019s life is a mass of contradiction. His father wants him to grow up American, yet at home he is still expected to honor Chinese customs. He can only speak English at home, yet his parents hardly understood English, putting a strain on their communication and parent-child relationship as a whole. His father sent him to a white elementary school on scholarship, yet makes him wear a badge that says \u201cI am Chinese\u201d.At school Henry is subjected to bullying and prejudice and because he is Asian he is mistaken for being Japanese. When Keiko arrived at the elementary school, Henry was happy to not be the only non-white, but then he learns she is Japanese. Knowing his father does not like Japanese people, he is standoffish with her at first, until a beautiful friendship starts developing between the two, which is inevitable since he has to work with her during lunch times in the school kitchen. A friendship with a risk, not only because of his parents\u2019 disapproval, but because at the time Americans declared war on the Japanese. After Henry and Keiko\u2019s relationship starts blooming into something more than friendship, she is taken away along with many other Japanese families to internment camps. It is here where he tells her he loves her for the first time. A fact only his friend Sheldon, a jazz player he and Keiko went to watch regularly, know.Over 40 years later, Henry has to deal with the loss of his wife Ethel and the strained relationship between him and his son, Marty. He learns that the Panama Hotel, situated in the previously called Japantown, has a new owner and that they found items belonging to Japanese families that was left there during the war times. Obviously this sparks Henry\u2019s interest. He is hopeful that some of Keiko\u2019s belongings are still there. He is looking for one singular item, had been for years\u2026I found this novel to be a heart-warming tale of romance, relationships and war. The story was beautiful and felt authentic. I mostly enjoyed the parts that played off in 1942, the historical detail about the war, but also the relationship that developed between these two young children. Not the soppiness that I tend to dislike, but a real, honest and beautiful relationship between two people. A caring friendship above all, that developed into love. I admire the young AND the old Henry. Henry, the man who cared tenderly for his wife during the time when she was ill, but especially Henry the boy who risked everything to help a family in need. Who held onto a friendship despite everyone being against it, for the girl he loves\u2026"}], "description": "In 1986, Henry Lee joins a crowd outside the Panama Hotel, once the gateway to Seattle's Japantown. It has been boarded up for decades, but now the new owner has discovered the belongings of Japanese families who were sent to internment camps during World War II. As the owner displays and unfurls a Japanese parasol, Henry, a Chinese American, remembers a young Japanese American girl from his childhood in the 1940s\u2014Keiko Okabe, with whom he forged a bond of friendship and innocent love that transcended the prejudices of their Old World ancestors. After Keiko and her family were evacuated to the internment camps, she and Henry could only hope that their promise to each other would be kept. Now, forty years later, Henry explores the hotel's basement for the Okabe family's belongings and for a long-lost object whose value he cannot even begin to measure.
