How wrong you can be! The good news is that when Al Queida does rear its head in Red Wing, Beck, as he is known, is ready for them.This book has many strong points. The writing is crisp and clean, and gets right to the point without meandering constantly into philosophy and exposition, a weakness of many books in this genre. The main character, Beck, is likeable and his talents are impressive. He relies more on brains and common sense than fancy gadgets and brawn. What I liked most about 19th Element is that the characters seem like real people, from Beck himself and his wife, Beth, to their daughter Sarah, to the local police chief, Gunner Gunderson, with whom Beck has to negotiate breathing room as he investigates, to a number of others as well. The author has done a fine job sketching out just enough detail to make these characters breathe, and the dialogue is spot on.What I also liked about The 19th Element is that I learned a ton about chemistry. The title refers to the element potassium, 19th on the periodic table. But we're not talking about bananas when it comes to Al Queida, as you might imagine. The author creates a plausible scenario for post 9-11 mayhem and destruction that should strike fear in any American heart. The tragedy of the meltdown in Fukushima, Japan makes the book even more topical, and from reading it I was able to understand better what happened there.If you are looking for a tremendous international thriller with a likeable hero, look no further. I'll be downloading another book by this author soon."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3111976-lisa", "userReview": "I really like Frederick's review of this book. It says what needs to be said without giving too much away.Speaking of chemistry...There was great chemistry between Beck and all the other characters and that element is on my periodic table of good writing.

They have recruited some homegrown anarchists to add to their terrorist forces, one of which is a Three Mile Island survivor with a huge grudge against the power plant, and two more with questionable education and background.James \"Beck\" Becker is a former elite U.S. government intelligence operative who has retired to his childhood hometown of Red Wing, Minnesota just a few miles from the Prairie River Nuclear Power Plant. After a university professor's body is found along the shore of the Mississippi River, clearly murdered, \"Beck\" gets in on the investigation and all his instincts tell him, this dead body is just the start of something much bigger. He is very concerned when he learns the professor's assistant is missing along with what could be a very dangerous piece of lab equipment. Later clues like a missing fertilizer truck and an international phone call only confirm to \"Beck\" that terrorists are involved and that something major is going to happen, but he can't convince any government officials that a huge threat exists. So with the help of his American Indian friend \"Bull\", he tries to foil the plan on his own.I am so glad John Betcher sent me this extraordinary thriller. It is scary good!! I say this because this fiction could easily become reality. This could definitely be a \"ripped from the headlines\" story. When I think of terrorist targets in the United States, I think of major cities, Washington D.C., New York, maybe Los Angeles, but this story takes place in my \"backyard\", the Upper Midwest. Also we know from history there are terrorists and their supporters here in the states, and this story brings them out front and center. Yes, this story is fiction but it has all the details that make you realize this could really happen. While this book entertains it also raises the readers awareness that there are people that want to hurt Americans.I had the pleasure of reading, reviewing and interviewing the author after her sent me his first book, The Missing Element, and while I truly loved that book, I enjoyed this book even more. This book is now tied with Harlan Coben's CAUGHT as the best book I have read this year. If you like a riveting, page turner this is definitely a book that should be in you hot little hands today. Don't wait, click the link below and order this book today! You will not be able to put it down until you finish the last page and you will be thinking about the reality of it for a long time after you put this book on your keeper shelf.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from the author..

In the spirit of disclosure, I purchased, and read, The 19th Element because I thought it and the author seemed interesting. At no time did I enter an agreement with the author to read or review his work. In The 19th Element, the preface displays an actual copy of a Daily Brief presented to then President George W. Bush, one month prior to 911. The memo expressed concern about a possible strike within the U.S. by Bin Laden. John Betcher's early use of this letter was dynamic. It gave credence to the scenario that followed, and remained foremost in my mind throughout.The author has a fabulous way with words. I found a great deal of personality in his lighthearted and refreshing, terminology. I personally, liked the term lawyering, I spend many hours working with attorneys, but where I come from; the term is not used. The 19th Element is part of a series of thrillers based on James Beck an attorney from Red Wing Minnesota. After completely a long career stint within the government, he and his wife have returned home with their two young daughters to settle into a healthy family environment. John Betcher develops awesome dynamics between James, and his wife. I simply loved their relationship. Beth is a decoder, and James openly adores and respects her intellectually.The book is a fabulous well-written thriller about nuclear terrorism. John understands and conveys the inner-workings of the nuclear facility with expertise. In light of the Nuclear Plant disaster in Japan, John's thriller is a timely masterpiece, especially for those interested in the structure, and mechanics surrounding Nuclear Plants.The 19th Element presents a plausible concern for the potential danger they possess. I highly recommend this James Becker Thriller."}, {"userName": "LLona Cunningham", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8351255-llona-cunningham", "userReview": "This is probably a 5-star story for anyone who enjoys conspiracy and terrorism based thrillers. To that point, I'm less a fan -- or maybe I'm just not open to more of the same religious zealot portrayal that comes daily in chain emails and news of terrorism around the world that comes unrelenting in our nightly news. As a work of fiction, I think the pace is good, the story is well researched and presented, and the characters are recognizable in their dialog. Some of the passages were so long that I wasn't sure whether a character was really that long winded or if the author was giving information I needed in order to follow the story. In either case, it sounded like true facts. Some of it sounded so real it made me want to pull the covers over my head and not come out again until tomorrow."}, {"userName": "*Avonna", "userReviewDate": "May 10, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5428424-avonna", "userReview": "I loved this thriller!

It had all of the points of a great thriller. Terrorists. Facts that are so real you can touch them. Details about how we have become so complacent in our day-to day lives that we forget how clever people who might want to harm us could be. The characters were believable and well designed.In his novel, John shows us his main character nicknamed James (aka Beck), and his wife Beth living in the small town of Red Wing, Minnesota. James and Beth were former agents for the US government, now retired and trying to live out a peaceful life with their daughters. That is, until a terrorist group decides to blow up a nearby nuclear plant, sending poisonous gasses across half of the continent. Beck puts a series of seemingly random incidents around town together and the big picture starts to emerge. He enlists the help of several friends in the area.The scary part is that John has done his homework. The threat of such an event happening is laid out in such stark detail that you could see how easily it could be done if we let our guard down. That's probably the most engaging part of the whole story. It really could happen.Overall, I really enjoyed the book. The ending was action-packed and filled with the kinds of details that kept me wanting more. But to get to this fabulous ending, I found the first half of the book to be a series of very dry, heavy loads of technical overview. The writing in the first half seemed to be written in a different point of Mr. Betcher's writing journey in comparison to the last half of the book. In the beginning, the characters were formed very well, but the fact presentation was weak, making it more dry than enjoyable. I know that many readers who are looking for a \"quick read before bed\" or a treat to take on the train or commute to work will easily find themselves overwhelmed with the enormity of it all.The second problem I have with the story is probably a matter of style. That is to say, I wouldn't have handled some of the wording or dialogue that way. There were some stylistic choices that Mr. Betcher employed that only compounded the enormity of the first-half-info-dump. While strictly speaking, there was nothing wrong with the writing itself, these odd choices didn't help the reader get through the dry areas. The dialogue tags should never take you out of the story. In fact, they should be nearly invisible as you read. But occasionally -- I assume to increase the speed through an action or to keep the speakers straight in a room full of people -- Mr. Betcher employed a more script-style format for dialogue that seemed to pull me out of the story and remind me that I was merely the reader, still in my bedroom reading a book.A final pet-peeve (and now I really am just nit=picking) his main antagonist was named John. The author's name is John. The protagonist's name is James. .. Alot of very similar names throughout the book. Had they been just bit parts, I probably would have never noticed. But because we were switching from James to John (or was that John to James?) .... I frequently had to stop and re-read sections to reorient myself as to whose head I was in. Again, another simple choice that made plodding through until you get used to who-is-who more difficult.If you are in the mood for a thriller that will leave you really thinking and watching the world around you with a fresh set of eyes, this book holds great potential. By the time I got to the end, I found that I REALLY enjoyed the story presented. Just be prepared to put in the time to see the whole story unfold, and look past some of the author's stylistic quirks.Pros: Great story. Realistic set-up. As scary and thought provoking as any story I've read in recent years.Cons: A bit dry at times that makes plodding through difficult, and odd stylistic choices for dialogue that compounds the issue.(Review from: http://jerryhanel.com/)"}, {"userName": "Keith Nixon", "userReviewDate": "Dec 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9798526-keith-nixon", "userReview": "An Al Qaeda terrorist cell plots to attack a nuclear power plant in the US heartland. Only one man, James Becker, can stop disaster happening.What's the point of a thriller? Well, I guess the clue is in the word itself. Unfortunately there were many issues with The 19th Element from a contrived plot (an Al Qaeda attack on a nuclear power plant?!) that never got out of second gear, to weak characters, and odd dialogue.First is Becker himself who failed to convince me of his credentials. He's ex-secret service, but then describes himself as wealthy because he invented a new bullet that can kill people at 1.5 miles (great!). He also has an unused degree - this and the money mean he's been able to change profession and still act undercover (although independently of the government) but seems able to call in favours at will, like bringing in two Apache helicopters to take out the bad guys at just the right moment.The writing isn't bad, it's just overly descriptive and ponderous. It's `tell' instead of `show', observation instead of participation. For example, Becker gets into a fight at one point, it felt like I was watching the process from afar. When Jack Reacher fights, he fights, you feel every punch, every injury, adrenalin pumps. Unfortunately not with Becker. I wanted to put on my pyjamas and go to bed with a hot water bottle.There were quite a few examples of this over use of tell. Remember the unused degree and new job. From the following, can you guess what Becker does?'Today was Wednesday and I was at my office. Becker Law Office. James L. Becker, Attorney-at-Law.'Um, I think he's an attorney? But I could be wrong.On occasion, there were long, bulleted and descriptive lists. Once Becker described everything he was carrying on a mission. So what? Then there was the whole set of instructions to take off in a B-24. Why?Then there were continuity errors. Most, but not all, chapters started with some or all of the time, date, and location. In the early chapters, the date jumped around. It was May 8th, then the 6th, back to the 8th, then the 7th, then to 1979 (this chapter didn't have a date description though!). It was difficult to keep an eye on. Sometimes you'd be informed that it was 3 am, then be immediately told this again the first line of the chapter. Or you'd be told you were on the plane, it's obvious. We know where Becker is because he hasn't moved. Tell, not show.Also, a couple of sub-plots seemed thrown in. A Mongolian, part of a gang Becker took down in his past, follows his daughter on campus. He races to save her. There's also some Al Qaeda observer early on that's explained away at the end, tied into the Mongolian.Finally, the style changed in some chapters. When in the nuclear plant scenes all of the dialogue is written as if it's a screenplay. Why? For interest perhaps. If so, it didn't work. It made the dialogue clunky.So overall a disappointing read. The 19th Element promised much but failed to deliver. I needed much more `thrill!' and a lot less `er?'**Originally reviewed for Al's Books & Pals blog.

Betcher is a first rate psychological thriller that will hook your interest early and keep you reading non-stop until the final page.Although this is the second release in the series, The 19th Element takes place a few months prior to the author's debut, The Missing Element. James \"Beck\" Becker has settled into retirement and is attempting to live a normal life, putting his law degree to use with a legal practice in his hometown of Red Wing, Minnesota. Not much happens in the small town so when a scientist-professor of agriculture is found murdered and the only suspect, a lab assistant, is missing, Beck takes notice. Beck may be officially retired from government intelligence work, but he cannot ignore his training, experience, or gut reactions. When he discovers that the assistant is Arab he brings his theories to the local police.Ottawa County's Chief Deputy Sheriff, Doug Gunderson, is somewhat aware of Beck\u2019s background and the pair has a friendship that goes back to school days. However, Gunderson is leery about starting a \"terrorists in Red Wing panic\" based on Beck's gut feelings and little hard evidence. When not one but two fertilizer trucks are hijacked, Beck begins to put the pieces together. He envisions an Oklahoma City-type bombing and the only target worth hitting would be the nearby Prairie River Nuclear Power Plant. Fearing a Chernobyl style meltdown, Beck continues his investigation despite the lack of support from any government agency or Gunderson. Beck has no faith in the FBI, Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), state police, or power plant security to ward off a terrorist attack and calls in his ex-military friend, Terry \"Bull\" Red Feather, for help. We meet perhaps the strangest sleeper cell imaginable. An Arab lab rat (desperate to show his worth to Al Qaeda) who is capable of turning a truck load of pot ash into a powerful bomb, and a pair of brainless, redneck anarchists led by a bitter and dying survivor of the 1979 Three Mile Island incident.The author brings all the players together for a tour de force final few dozen pages that make The 19th Element one of the most entertaining, exciting thrillers I've read in a long time. Becker is a character that you can cheer for. The banter between Beck and his wife, and Beck and Gunderson shows the author\u2019s substantial talent for writing dialogue. A relentless pace, quirky yet realistic dialogue, and fascinating, believable characters keep the pages turning. Considerable research, attention to detail, and a well-plotted story make this a memorable read.

The man to tie up the loose ends and resolve the case is none other than James \u201cBeck\u201d Becker, a former elite U.S. government intelligence operative who has retired to his childhood hometown of Red Wing, Minnesota, just six miles down the Mississippi from the Prairie River nuclear facility.When the body of a University professor of agronomy turns up on the Mississippi River bank, Beck suspects foul play of a terrorist kind. His instinct tells him there is a connection between the victim and his missing lab assistant Farris Ahmed, an international cell phone call and a stolen fertilizer truck, but no one believes him. After all, who could take seriously his suspicions of a potassium bomb attack on a nuclear plant facility? The local police, the FBI and the nuclear plant security scoff at his ideas until things start rolling and it looks as if there is only one way things will end \u2026 in disaster. In fact Beck is not wrong. Al Qaeda plans to attack Minnesota\u2019s Prairie River Power Plant as a means to restore the organization\u2019s fading reputation to international prominence. It is indeed a motley crew that Beck finds himself up against: Al Qaeda has struggled to get Arab operatives into the nuclear facility and has resorted to using two dim-witted homegrown anarchists and a Three Mile Island survivor with a pathological vendetta against the nuclear establishment.The author has established a likeable character in James Becker, one who has appeared in a previous novel and will no doubt feature in future political thrillers. By handling much of the narration, Beck\u2019s character imbues the novel with his own style and personality. Beck is laid-back, with a dry sense of humor and an unerring instinct for danger. He trusts his gut and so do his friends, namely Ottawa County\u2019s Chief Deputy Sheriff, Doug Gunderson, aka \u201cGunner\u201d and Terry Red Feather, a full-blooded Mdewakanton Dakota American Indian, aka \u201cBull.\u201d This book is an excellent read, with the author managing to steer the untutored reader through a maze of technical details about nuclear power and potassium bombs without losing attention. My one criticism would be that the story slows down in the middle with the author \u201ctelling\u201d rather than \u201cshowing\u201d but speeds up to a satisfying and thrilling climax.

In your imaginary world, your families are safe. Your neighbors are safe. We are all totally safe. Your delusions have led you to the conclusion that the nuclear catastrophe waiting to happen inside that fence across the parking lot is a fiction. Of course, you all know how extreme the consequences of a successful terrorist attack on the nuclear plant would be. But because of your fantasies, you discount the dangers \u2013 not only to yourselves and your loved ones, but to everyone in the eastern half of the United States and possibly beyond. But what if the worst possible scenario proves not to be a fantasy at all, but a deadly fact?\u201dThese words and more are spoken by James \"Beck\" Becker as he tries to convince a security group meeting at the Prairie River Nuclear Plant that there is very possibly a real threat of an attempt by Al Qaeda to run a plane full of explosives into their spent fuel pool. They simply aren\u2019t buying it. After the murder of a professor who had been experimenting with potassium turns up on the shores of the Mississippi, Beck started putting things together. When he learned the name of the professor\u2019s assistant, Farris Ahmed, he knew he was on to something big. After researching potassium, as well as the procedures taken to secure nuclear waste, Beck was positive that there would be an attack -- and the nuclear plant would be the target. But getting the attention of those responsible for security without appearing to be a total fool was almost impossible.In reading The 19th Element, I\u2019ve had a quick enlightenment as to how power companies make power. I\u2019ve learned what actually happens to \u201cspent\u201d nuclear fuel. I\u2019ve also been educated on the true hatred that seeps from the influence of Al Qaeda. And to be totally honest with everyone, it scares the pure hell out of me! I can see the possibilities of a nuclear disaster such as the one envisioned in The 19th Element actually happening. My question is, are we truly prepared for this or anything even close to this happening? I can only pray that we are. The 19th Element is definitely a \u201cwake-up America\u201d book that we should all read and listen to.316 pages2010ISBN# 1451521014Review Stir, Laugh, Repeat at Amazon.com Stir, Laugh, Repeat"}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7083454-andrew", "userReview": "This is the first book in the \u2018James Becker\u2019 series by John L Betcher.Our hero and his wife live in Red Wing, Minnesota. While he occupies his days as an attorney his background, which is only ever hinted at, was as some kind of clandestine military intelligence operative. This \u2018hinting\u2019 is quite effective as it allows the author some freedom with the character and the skills he might need to possess for each story.Beck\u2019s wife (also with an intelligence background), his best friend Bull, and local Sherriff Doug Gunderson are the main characters and they are nicely crafted, fitting their surroundings very well.Some troubled citizens get mixed up with Al Qaeda to get their revenge on a nuclear industry and government they feel has let them down and done them harm. A death and an unexplained explosion make Beck sure that something is going on, and he doesn\u2019t think it it going to end well.My self-imposed rule for series, is to read them in order. In this case I inadvertently read #2 first, then this one, but this did not affect my enjoyment. Having read the two I can say that the feel is the same for both. To me they are thrillers set in a small town, with a very cozy feeling. The Beckers are obviously still very much in love, but not to the point of being distracting. If he needs to go deal with some bad guys, he does it, without angst over the poor woman he had to leave behind. I\u2019ve read a couple of books recently where this was not the case and those books were ruined for me. They are (mostly) retired spies who periodically need to revive some of their old skills.This book is a comfortable read, with a hero who has just the right amount of humour.(I read the Kindle Edition which I downloaded for free during a promotion.)"}, {"userName": "Andrew Ian  Dodge", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4354999-andrew-ian-dodge", "userReview": "The first thing that struck me as I read The 19th Element, the next James Becker thriller, was that my chemistry knowledge had not completely been lost, and I knew what element he was referring to in the title. And that element is very much the center to this tale of terrorism and sloughy bureaucracy.The novel makes a very interesting point as we near the 10th anniversary of 9/11. It speculates that because there have not been any major attacks by al Queda, we are not as well protected as we are led to believe. Combined with changing technology of warfare, that has made us vulnerable once more.The character Beck is clearly a worried man, then again that is what he does for a living. He discovers a plot to blow up a nuclear power station and create a Chernobyl-style disaster on an enlarged scale. Not only does he have to find out what a sleeper cell is up to, he also has to battle lazy and incompetent bureaucrats who think he is paranoid.As with Betcher's previous book the prose does not dally about. It moves quickly and I was able to read the novel in one afternoon. His minimalist approach to writing might not be for all, but it does make for a pacey read.It can be seen as absolute antithesis to those weighty tomes that clog up the airport bookstores. This would make a perfect book to read on the plane, especially as airplanes feature in the novel.Even more so than the last one this book screams to be made into a movie. A script would be easy to pluck from this novel.I recommend both this release and the previous one. It is a fine summer read for your next few days off.Read more: http://blogcritics.org/books/article/..."}, {"userName": "Tim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7878599-tim", "userReview": "This was a very good thriller, along the same vein as Vince Flynn's Mitch Rapp series. The plot was original and well thought out. I also thought the protagonist, Beck, was fairly well developed and easy to relate to. I wish I had a little more back story on him, though, as I would have liked some more background on his experience. I think this would have made him even more believable to the reader in the story when he was talking to the Chief Deputy (btw, where was the sheriff in all this?) and the others in presenting his theories. Some of the other characters could be expanded, too, especially the Chief Deputy and Bull (as I think they are recurring characters). Maybe we will get more in future books in the series.The other thing that bothered me about this book was the beginning. Don't get me wrong, I am fine with flashbacks that move the story along, but the first part of the book was not linear at all. Betcher was jumping back and forth in time between \"present day\" and times that were anywhere from a couple of weeks previous to a year previous. What's the point? I think he (the author) could have put the chapter in Germany first as well as rearranging the other chapters to put them sequentially and not introduced Beck right away. My opinion only...Definitely a good read and I will look for more books in this series. I would recommend this to others, too."}, {"userName": "Francis", "userReviewDate": "Nov 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5792975-francis", "userReview": "When I was young my father bought a collection of children's classics along with a set of the real stuff. So, I read Treasure Island, Robin Hood, Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and anything I could get my hands on. And, every once in awhile I would check out something from the other collection, like maybe a Crime and Punishment, always making sure to stay away from anything that might hint of romance. However, there came times when I needed something a little light, especially after a Dostoyevsky and at those times I would turn to my trusted comic book collection again confining myself to the classics of course like Scrooge McDuck, Dick Tracy, Beetle Bailey or perhaps a Batman when in a darker mood.So anyway I'm an adult now. Well maybe an old man would be a more descriptive way of putting it, but I still like my novels. But every once in awhile, I need a comic book, something light and escapist with little value beyond a little enjoyable entertainment. When I feel that need for simple characters, black and white situations and no consideration for shades of gray, that's when, I reach for a book like this. I put plausibility on hold, I put my mind to rest. I lean back in my armchair. I relax, I smile, I tell my internal critic to go to hell and I enjoy, knowing tomorrow he will rise again."}, {"userName": "Anthony", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10781840-anthony", "userReview": "June 2, 2013A Review by Anthony T. Riggio of John L. Betcher\u2019s Novel: The 19th ElementI read this book on my Kindle and I believe, it was free at the time I downloaded the book and this sort of made it worthwhile.This book is for anyone who feels like reading any of the voluminous books of this genre. It is an almost fantasy hero story of a former CIA operative who is retired in Minnesota and practicing Law and who single handed solves an al Qaeda terrorist plot to blow up a local Nuclear plant. No one believes him that this is \u201cpossible\u201d based only on his instincts and conjectures he has about the death of a local scientist who has developed a process and a device to extract elemental potassium, which is highly unstable in its non-protective state.The story has an interesting plot and will hold the reader\u2019s attention. This is escapist reading but every once \u2018n a while you need to seek refuge in the world of improbabilities. This book is not literature that will endure the ages but it is fun and the reader should not expect more. I gave the story two stars and did find one mistake in the book. When the hero rents a Ferrari, he subsequently refers to it as a Jag. Notwithstanding it is good \u201csummertime \u201c reading or on a plane ride."}], "description": "Terrorists plan to attack Minnesota's Prairie River Nuclear Power Plant, but they\u2019re not your typical band of Islamic extremists. True, there\u2019s an al Qaeda connection. But the heart of the \u2018terror cell\u2019 is homegrown, right here in the United States.James \"Beck\" Becker is a former elite U.S. government intelligence operative who has retired to his childhood hometown of Red Wing, Minnesota \u2013 just six miles down the Mississippi from the Prairie River Power Station. He recognizes connections between seemingly unrelated incidents \u2013 a murdered agronomy professor, a missing lab assistant, an international cell call, a stolen fertilizer truck, an explosion in the street in front of City Hall \u2013 but can't piece it together in enough detail to convince government authorities that a larger threat exists. Only his American Indian friend, \"Bull,\" will help Beck defuse the threat.So it's Beck and Bull versus the best terror cell west of the Mississippi.May the better men win.", "title": "The 19th Element\n      \n          (James Becker #1)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8582517-the-19th-element", "average": 3.69, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1330402155l/8582517.jpg", "reviews": 96, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3021001.John_L_Betcher", "name": "John L.
