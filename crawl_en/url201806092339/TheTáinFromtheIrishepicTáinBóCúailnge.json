THAT TITLE'S ALREADY TAKEN.Because, as every cultured person knows, \"The Tain\" (pronunciation \"Thoyne\") is the name given to the most important story in ancient Irish literature, the collection of tales also referred to as \"The Ulster Cycle\", or \"The Cattle Raid of Cooley\". I sputtered with indignation at the thought that someone would steal the name of Ireland's best-known legend for some weirdo post-apocalyptic novella about a race of wraith creatures that humans have subjugated by trapping them in mirrors. Then I learned that \"tain\" is a legitimate English word meaning \"the tinfoil used as backing in mirrors\" and I felt pretty stupid. SORRY, CHINA! Like any self-respecting national saga, the (Irish) Tain lacks a single definitive version. Most versions draw on two different ancient manuscripts, from the 12th and 14th centuries, respectively, but its origins are far older. Some of the language dates back as far as the 8th century, and most Celtic scholars believe the the story had a long oral existence before eventually being committed to writing by monastic scribes. Both the content and the style of the narrative place the events in a timeframe that predates the introduction of Christianity to Ireland in 432, possibly as far back as the first century.Most Irish people of my generation are familiar with the 1969 translation of the epic by the poet Thomas Kinsella (with brush drawings by Louis de Brocquy). I read the Kinsella translation at some point when I was in college, largely from a sense of obligation. Its brilliance was completely wasted on me at the time. I recently stumbled across a more recent (2007) translation of the Tain, by the poet Ciaran Carson. I really liked Carson's translation of Dante's Inferno, so I was interested to see what he would make of the Tain. So this past weekend I sat down with both the Kinsella and Carson translations, to reacquaint myself with the legendary exploits of the Celtic heroes of the Tain. Like any self-respecting national saga, whole chunks of the Tain are unreadable. But much of it is hilarious; I had forgotten how weirdly entertaining the story is. A successful national epic will presumably reflect the concerns of the listeners -- people who make a living by taking to the sea in boats worry about sea-monsters, lost ships, threats of a maritime nature. In Argentina, cattle are central to economic survival, no surprise then that the gaucho is the hero of Argentina's national epic, Martin Fierro. Cattle were important in pre-Christian Ireland as well -- at its heart the Tain is the account of a cattle-rustling expedition gone terribly, terribly wrong.The story of the Tain is straightforward; its particular charm lies in the telling. Here are some of the details I find totally kickass:The opening scene, in which Ailill and Maeve, the king and queen of Connacht get swept up in a competitive enumeration of the wealth and possessions each has brought to the marriage, is referred to as the \"pillow talk\" scene. Maeve loses the competition by a bull and vows to get even; this is the McGuffin that launches the whole disastrous expedition to steal Donn Cuailgne, the great Brown Bull of Cooley, from the neighboring kingdom of Ulster. The men of Ulster are all laid low by \"the pangs\". Because of a previous incident, involving a distinct lack of chivalry towards a pregnant lady, nine generations of Ulstermen have been cursed to suffer the pains of childbirth for five days and four nights \"at their moment of greatest difficulty\". So, just as the marauding Connacht army reaches their border, all the men of fighting age take to their beds, howling as if each was about to give birth to twins. Oops, make that \"all but one\" of the men. For unspecified reasons, the hero CuChulainn (aka the hound of Culann the blacksmith, aka Setanta) is exempt from the curse, so it falls to him to keep the marauders at bay until his fellow Ulstermen have recovered from the pangs. It's roughly 30,000 to 1 out there. In other words, a completely unfair set up. The Connacht soldiers don't stand a chance. CuChulainn isn't your average 17-year old. He's Ireland's version of Hercules. Super-endowed physically, not particularly bright, poorly developed emotional control, no impulse control, the boy has some serious combat skilz. With a couple of nifty superpowers thrown in. That cloak of invisibility, for one thing. Those heightened sensory powers. But the worst thing you can to is to make him angry, because that can trigger the  riastradh, (the twisting, or contortion), a Hulk-like physical transformation that is followed by a killing frenzy. Kinsella translates this wonderfully as the \"warp spasm\"; in a rare misstep, Carson tries too hard and comes up with the the \"torque\" (he wants to evoke the kind of Celtic collar known as a torque, but why?). The killing frenzy proceeds by repeated implementation of the \"thunder-feat\", wherein enemy soldiers are taken out in increments of 100. I can't imagine that there's not already a video game.CuChulainn's deadly kill-weapon, the Gae Bolga, totally rocks (as does its name). And the passage where he ultimately has no choice but to use it to disembowel his beloved childhood friend Ferdia is simultaneously devastating (OMG, he is forced to kill his best bro Ferdy) and provocative (explicit homoerotic imagery in ancient Celtic texts, who'd a thunk it?) There's also an entertaining array of secondary characters -- backstabbing relatives and courtiers, wild women with the gift of prophecy, assorted figures from Celtic mythology, including the very nasty shapeshifting morrigan, a kind of unpleasant Celtic valkyrie you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley.Both the Kinsella and Carson translations are highly readable. There are slight differences in their choices of what to include. Kinsella's coverage is greater, because he includes full translations of certain key remsceala (backstories), where Carson limits himself to summarizing them briefly in his endnotes. Both authors comment on the particular difficulties posed by certain sections of the manuscript, those written in the specific verse form known as rosc. These sections are apparently so obscure that both authors felt obliged to include an explicit disavowal of accuracy for their attempted translations. Carson tries for a greater fidelity to the original verse form, which makes for a much choppier, less intelligible translation. Obviously I can't judge the accuracy of either translation, but I thought both authors did an impressive job in terms of clarity, fluidity, and readability. Neither translation seems clearly superior - they are just different.I feel obliged to include a caveat. There are certain aspects of the text that make some portions eye-glazingly unreadable. Two features in particular come to mind. The first is a kind of listmania -- the number of warriors taken down by Cuchulainn is enormous, and the authors of this manuscript want you know each one by name. This leads to this kind of incandescent prose:These are the names of their chiefs and commanders: two Cruaids, two Calads, two Cirs, two Ciars, two Ecelss, three Croms, three Cauraths, three Combirges, four Feochars, four Furachars, four Casses, four Fotas, ....(varying numbers of 18 more family names)...., ten Fiachas and ten Fedelmids.The second issue is related. In Carson's words,  the Tain is obsessed by topography, by place-names and their etymologies . It's hard to convey just how deep this apparent obsession runs. At times it seems as if the entire manuscript is nothing more than an effort to come up with a (dubious) etymology for the name of every topographical feature of the Irish landscape. Lethan came to his ford on the river Nith in Conaille. Galled by Cuchulainn's deeds, he lay in wait for him. CuChulainn cut off his head and left it with the body. Hence the name Ath Lethan. This kind of stuff is both extraordinarily dull and highly questionable, particularly when one takes into account that the word \"lethan\" means \"broad\". One begins to suspect that the brave warrior \"Lethan\" might not have existed at all. There are huge swaths of this kind of material scattered throughout the Tain. The good news is that it is eminently skippable. Bearing this caveat in mind, I think anyone would enjoy the Tain."}, {"userName": "Robert", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1433865-robert", "userReview": "The Tain is epic.

Oi - you at the back! stop saying, \"No.\"here we go:Illiad: Achilles only vulnerable on one heel.Tain: CuChulain's foster brother only vulnerable to a gae bolga shoved where the sun doesn't shine.

Let me just say I have some questions about this translation, and about the original transcribers who more than likely put their own spin on this story. What's more there are multiple modern translations that differ in transliteration and literary style and I'd like to understand the differences. All aside this is a tale that begins with a trivial quarrel of a queen and her lover which escalates to the point of all Ireland getting involved after a cattle deal went bad in the process of settling their domestic dispute. The End.Beyond the explanations for how certain places got their name, it's upon the reader to extract any morals. The most obvious takes are thou shalt not covet, try to talk it out first, don't bite off more than you can chew, and if it sounds too good to be true it probably is.You'll find several instances of absurd Looney Tune like descriptions of violence, there's also just a lot of violence... I enjoyed the descriptive detail of costume and arms down to a man (and a woman or two). There was one point when the men of Ulster were rallying and it was like a role call of medieval superheroes.Battles with the protagonist a.k.a. the boy hero: C\u00fa Chulainn were over the top. When he's pissed he gets his Torque-on ...basically a fit of battle rage that transforms him into some kind of Hell-Hulk who goes on a rampage in his war chariot.\nBy Joseph Christian Leyendecker (1874 - 1951) [Public domain], via Wikimedia CommonsNo doubts this would make a great movie script, that would probably be a lot harder for Hollywood to screw up as it's all action, and pretty predictable in the drama department.If you're the serious type I don't recommend this, but If you have a morbid sense of humor this will be great fun I'm sure."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3144945-alex", "userReview": "[. Medb offers to sleep with the Ulster cattle-owner if he'll give it to her. He refuses (after some consideration), so they decide to take it by force. (Why Ailill goes along with this is never explained.) For further insight into Medb's character: when she gets her period, she fills three trenches big enough that armies have to ford them. So there's that. Like the Old Testament, one of the Tain's central messages is that women are the root of all evil: \"That's what happens when a mare leads a herd of horses - all their energy gets pissed away, following the rump of a skittish female.\" I would feel offended by this, but it is true that Irish women are pretty slutty. As opposed to Boston women, who are all...mostly Irish.Unfortunately for Ulster, their entire force is currently laid low by a periodic curse that makes them unable to fight, except the 17-year-old prodigy Cu Chulainn, who once got so carried away during battle practice that all Ulster's women had to flash their tits at him to distract him from killing his own friends. He proceeds to hold the entire Irish army back single-handedly via guerrilla warfare, Braveheart-style, and the time-honored Jackie Chan \"one at a time\" fighting method. (After a while, Ailill and Medb take to betrothing their daughter to volunteers to take on Cu Chulainn, which she seems agreeable to until half the camp realizes they're engaged to her and kill each other; at that point she finally dies of shame.)All the while Fergus, an Ulster exile and foster father of Cu Chulainn, is playing both sides; although technically on the Irish side, he repeatedly warns Cu Chulainn of traps and tries to delay Ailill and Medb. Finally, the Ulstermen get over The Curse - yes, this is the only national epic that's more or less about periods - and, y'know, big-ass battle, and a remarkably perfect ending.

I had to buy it, of course--it's not often I find real evidence of Celtic Studies works showing up in bookstores, and when I do find titles that fit the bill, I always buy them. Bookstores need to be supported and congratulated for stocking things that are outside of the mainstream.I was afraid to read the book because I was convinced that Thomas Kinsella's translation, graced by Louis le Brocquy's genius illustrations, was the only translation I could ever love. I'm a huge fan of Carson's, so I really wanted his work to shine. Moreover, a few years ago I had a fraught, life-affirming conversation with Carson about translation and poetry and voice where he convinced me with just a few words that I should keep up my own attempts at poetry in translation. So I needed his version of this great work to be wonderful.I needn't have worried. Carson opens the book with an introduction explaining just how hesitant he was to publish a translation of the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge, in light of Kinsella's masterful work. Carson even calls his translation an homage to Kinsella. Like Kinsella, Carson used Recension I. Carson chose not to include the remsc\u00e9la, or fore-tales, which are some of my favorite bits, but which aren't physically included in Lebor na hUidre or The Yellow Book of Lecan, the two texts in which The Tain survives.Carson is a wonderful translator. He's fluent in modern Irish, and he's a musician as well as a poet and writer, and I think those skills combine to enrich his translation. He is clearly intrigued by the true characters of C\u00fa Chulainn, Medb, Ailill, and Fergus, and by the mores surrounding sex, violence, honor, ownership, land, family--all the big ones. Having read his and compared it to Kinsella's, I don't think I can read one without the other again. Both convince me to keep struggling through language and myth that is so distant from my daily life."}, {"userName": "Jason", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4103848-jason", "userReview": "Imagine someone took you for a walk from the North to the South of the USA, from New England across the Mason-Dixon line and onward to Georgia, all the while using cues from the landscape to narrate the Civil War. The T\u00e1in does this, guiding the reader through an interactive map where the story and the landscape are inseparable. While undeniably a \"classic\" epic, the unity of place, narrative, and heritage gives The T\u00e1in the feel of classic Indian epics, like the Bhagavad Gita and Ramayana, couching stories within stories and relying on a body of tales outside of the work at hand for reference. The resulting diverted and allusion-filled text offers a satisfying richness, a remarkable accomplishment given how starkly the text was written (or translated?). It paints the Irish world with a few strokes.Indeed, one thought I had reading The T\u00e1in was a genuine surprise that neither the BBC nor the SciFi channels had thought to remake the story in mini-series form. The bare bones nature of the tale had me hungry to see the work fleshed out.

I always kind of forget how very, very weird the Irish were. We just spent 30 minutes in each section talking about sex, and then 20 on whether this is a credible source or not for the 1st century. Cuchulainn kills people in the most interesting ways. Anyway, I love this book - it just is such a reminder that people think about the world differently. Kinsella's translation is also interesting - no notes marked in the text, but lots of notes at the end (this is a pet peeve of mine, as you might be able to tell). Because of the nature of our sources, he has to choose which bits of the different manuscripts to include, and try to reconcile the mess of a story that is left (some people die several times, for example).

But I will, anyway.It is a minor embarrassment that I had not read The T\u00e1in until last week. When my sister found out she made me, which is fair enough. We are quite immersed in many of the stories surrounding the Ulster cycle during our education: the young C\u00fachulainn, Medb and Ailill. We are even told a vastly simplified version of the T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge, mostly focusing on the two bulls and not the war going on around them.My first shock was how blood-thirsty the epic is. They certainly excised that aspect of the tales in school. My second was how funny it was. And I'm still not sure if the humour is intentional. There's a section where Cathach comes back after riding his chariot off into battle alone, and he's been ripped to bits. C\u00fachulainn sends for healers and 15 (some say 50) of them come and each says he's done for, and every time one of them says that Cathach kills them with a fierce punch. Eventually C\u00fachulainn says \"Come on Cathach, you can't be killing healers.\" A healer eventually comes and agrees to treat Cathach, and he begins describing each wound, and each awful wound he mentions Cathach describes the man or men who inflicted them, and C\u00fachulainn says \"Oh! I know them! That's the brothers so-and-so, they're the son of this guy and have killed that guy.\" This goes on for three pages, in exactly the same repetitive structure. And it's so long and elaborate that it seems like it must be comic, but I'm just not sure.These tales were written down by monks in the 12th century from spoken stories that had been passed down for hundreds of years, since perhaps around 0AD. So they are very like Homer's works, and that you can see the repetition and exaggeration that would be characteristic of such stories. So much of Irish storytelling shows its roots in this work.Also: the depiction of women in these stories is really interesting. There are warrior queens. Strong women. Girls decide who they will marry. Men must pursue them and gain their approval. It is simply a fundamentally different relationship to the gender roles Christianity brought to this country.A couple of times men make harsh statements about women in general, but it's always born out of a frustration with the fact that, e.g. Medb wont stop sending warriors to kill them.

It's an epic based around the feats of C\u00f9 Chulainn, as he defends the land of Ulster from the armies of Ailell and Medb. It's (here's one of my favourite words again) hyperbolic and, well, it's an epic, what do you expect? There's verse and one-on-one combats and ridiculous feats of arms involving throwing spears through boulders and so on. I was actually surprised by how little I knew about The Tain. I'm sure I've read plenty about C\u00f9 Chulainn, but knew very little about what goes on in the Cattle Raid.The translation seems clear and is very easy to read, though I can't comment on accuracy.

In this pre-Christian epic, we see how people make meaning of their lives without their perspective being \"muddled\" by ideas about God, heaven, hell, right and wrong. What would it be like? Much to the chagrin of an atheist/secularist/anti-Christian activist, life is hell-ish without religion.Take sex. Secularists say Christianity spoils sex for everyone - why does have to come with promises and love and all that? Just let people have fun without moralizing everything, they say! (Except rape. Rape is wrong. That's when we're allowed to be moral. *eye roll*)You think we live in a rape culture NOW? You think taking the morality out of sex makes it more fun? You should have lived in Ireland in the early centuries. You'd see that sex free from morality was anything but fun, ESPECIALLY for women. Men - because they call the shots, because they're bigger and stronger - make the rules. Men used sex to relieve themselves and baits fools into traps. Women were their pleasure toys. At best, women bore men sons, who could then grow up and fight and use women just like their fathers did.The female characters with agency only obtain agency by acting as horribly as the men do. They're violent, glory-hungry, and evil. There's bloodthirsty Queen Medb, who's obsessed with one-upping her husband and leads thousands of men to their death for the sake of her pride. She has sex with Fergus to keep his military loyalty, and doesn't care that her husband knows about it. (Sounds a bit like contemporary feminist logic, doesn't it? \"Two wrongs make a right!\" *eyerolleyeroll*) Then there's the witch Morrigan, who randomly comes and and tries to shame Cuchulainn while he's single-handedly defending his country from Medb's men. He doesn't let her get away with it, though. Not all women have this \"if you can't beat 'em, join 'em\" sexual survival strategy that Medb represents. Beautiful Derdriu, after being taken captive by her husband's murderer, refuses to have sex with him - which is strange, since he earned her sex through violence, of course. When he can't get her to have sex with him, she's shipped off to have sex with his best friend. In one of the only true romantic moves of the epic, she throws herself onto a boulder and is smashed to pieces to preserve her honor and stay faithful to her husband's memory. Sex DOES mean something to her, and she'd rather die than validate a worldview in which power trumps love. Another miserable women, Finnebair (Medb's daughter) learns how many men died after they were promised sex with her (hundreds). Humiliated and traumatized, she dies of shame on the spot. Her sex was only bait and a fun time to everyone except her. Rather than conform her worldview to theirs, she dies, and shows us that, despite society's opinion, sex MEANS something to her.I could go on about this, but Wendy Shalit can probably say this all better than me. Basically, I think contemporary secularists want to believe that if only we could get rid of all this stupid Christian meaning, sex could be fun again. Well, sex was anything but fun before all the Christian meaning came along. And with girls today still killing themselves, cutting themselves, getting eating disorders, and getting raped, I think we'd better stop and wonder if we're really doing anyone any favors by trying to bring a Christian/religion free sexual landscape back to society. Another quick note: Derdriu's suicide is actually one of the ONLY moments in the epic that features people acting as if anything other than fame and victory matters. Touchingly, another rare moment like this happens when Cuchulainn kills his foster brother Ferdia. After growing up together and fighting side by side many a battle, they now have to fight to the death. Cuchulainn begs Ferdia not to fight, since he loves him and doesn't want to kill him, but Ferdia fights anyways (because he's been promised sex with Finnebair). After Cuchulainn slays Feria, he lays by his body and weeps. This is a shocking moment, since Cuchulainn has slain hundreds of men with extraordinary violence without thought. The epic also doesn't devote any special narrational time to most deaths. It just reads \"then so and so's guts spilled out and he died, and maybe a hill was named after him or something.\" Then we move on. But here, we get a whole monologue from Cuchulainn:\"All play, all sport,until Ferdia came to the ford.I thought beloved Ferdiawould live forever after me-yesterday, a mountain-slope;today, only a shade.I have slaughtered, on this Tain,three countless multitudes:choice cattle, choice men,choice horses, fallen everywhere!The army, a huge multitude,that came from cruel Cruachanhas lost between a half and third,slaughtered in my savage sport.Never came to the battle-field,nor did Bamba's belly bear,nor over sea or land camea king's son of fairer fame.\"After killing a friend, Cuchulainn learns the meaning of death. He's killed \"a half and a third\" of an army and not given anyone's life much thought, but Ferdia's death wakes something up in him. It *means* something to him. Like Derdriu and Finnebair, Cuchulainn life begins to have meaning after heartbreak. He becomes reflective, and even wise: \"yesterday, a mountain-slope; / today, only a shade\" implies a towering question: what is this all for? Life, no matter how glorious, ends for everyone; what do we make of that? What do we think? To me, this epic is a heartbreaking, haunting, and warning portrait of what man without religion is like. He's empty, desperate, and violent. The world is cruel and life is short. But man, in the face of all this, is also questioning. Derdriu, Finnebair and Cuchulainn bring the reader sudden moments of reflection.What is life? Does love matter? What does it mean that we die?Is it any wonder that Christianity spread like wildfire throughout Ireland, after lives like these?"}, {"userName": "Yann", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5841104-yann", "userReview": "On ne peut manquer d'\u00eatre \u00e9mu quand on pense que ce texte nous viens de si loin, mais quelle violence!

It is a most entertaining read, with humor, gore, implausibility, and wild exaggeration. When reading such a work, I think it is important, at least at first, to suspend one\u2019s critical faculties, pretend that one knows the plot and outcome, and listen as if one were listening to an oral recitation, enjoying the individual variations on epic formulae and a familiar story. And read it slowly with an ear to recognition. In a nutshell, and a very small nutshell, this is the story of a raid on Ulster by the forces of the rest of Ireland, the object being to steal a prize bull. The Irish forces of Mebd and Ailill are opposed by the teenaged super-hero Cuchulainn alone until the Ulster forces are able to muster themselves and come to the rescue. I found the work delightful.

Except for the purposefully obscure roscata (a feature of Celtic myth consisting of fragmented prose-poetry), it is fairly easy to follow the action and sequence of events in this myth, which is important because sometimes the story depends on seemingly supernatural events or actions.The story itself does a good job of retaining traces of an oral storytelling tradition, like highly stylized descriptions of people, repeated phrases, and long catalogues of deeds and people. However, this text also demonstrates the complex interplay of culture because these pagan Celtic myths were recorded by Christian monks centuries after Ireland converted to Christianity.

I had heard it was the Irish legend to read. The part I didn't like was pages and pages of names and places over and over again, it got to where I just skipped over the names and places. I found it monotonous and boring. The core of the story, (the war on Ulster by Queen Maeb, the magic bulls and my favorite champion, Cuchulainn) was good but could have been written better. I'm sure, at the time when this was an oral tradition, it was fantastic hearing your own family name in the story often but these are different times. I could have done without the repetitive names and places and just enjoyed an awesome story."}, {"userName": "Pedro", "userReviewDate": "Jul 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2528093-pedro", "userReview": "The best epic story ever !

The verse is stark, at least when judged against the more ornamented forms of the period. Kinsella\u2019s translation is generally unremarkable, and is most impressive in the early, \u2018pre-Tain\u2019 selections.

Been a while since I read his translation though.Thought this flowed very well.My only gripe was that there weren't enough notes. There were a fair few times that I got a ref to some other tale and was surprised that it didn't have an explanation in the notes. This doesn't spoil the tale, but if you've not read, or heard, other old tales you may miss out on some of the depth that wee hints imply. (For instance the battle between the Wee Hound and his son is hinted at, but no details in the notes.) I think this would have helped put the tale in the correct context for the interested general reader.Still, I loved this.The idea of the Torque (Kinsella calls it a warp-spasm) is as gruesome as ever, and makes Viking Berserkers seem like wee old ladies sitting knitting by comparison.It doesn't shy away from the horrors of war, pretty much everyone kills non combatants. Yet there is a horrible slapstick to some of the fights.As the Wee Hound says: \"I come like a wild boar to overthrow the rule of armies.\""}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/105081-andrew", "userReview": "This curious tale is one of the oldest and longest ancient Irish tales. It recounts the exploits of Irish hero Cu Chulainn as he repels an army come to steal the Ulstermen's prize bull, the Dun Cuailnge. I'm pretty sure it is the most violent piece of literature I've read, and I've read Blood Meridian. Heads are lost, men are cut in twain, and a few are speared through their \"rear portal.\" And those are the most normal ways people die. The story freely takes in the hyperbolically heroic, to the extend that it almost reads like an ancient comic book. As an artifact of ancient Ireland it is compelling. As a piece of literature, I'm less sold. It simply doesn't hold up to the style, complexity, and power of Beowulf or The Odyssey, for example. It is no epic. But that's not to say it isn't really good and interesting. It's unadulterated grandiosity is amazing, and its hybrid forms of prose, poetry, and \"other\" and very interesting. Not for the faint of heart or those not interested in things ancient/medieval and epic."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5036642-john", "userReview": "I am glad I read this book. I believe this translation (Kinsella) to be excellent; the notes were helpful; and unlike the other modern translation (which puts the backstory in footnotes), this version begins with each of the tales that comprise the backstory of the epic.Now as to the merits of the work. It is the major Irish epic -- about a cattle raid. If I could sum it up in one word, it is weird and gory, with some low humor (I think it was meant as such) and a number of inconsistencies due to the state of the text. There is also a lot of explanation of the origins of place names which can be skimmed (similar to the Iliad's catalog of ships) and some obscure prophecy poetry.If you like this kind of stuff, are Irish or interested in Irish history/mythology, you should probably read this work at some point, and I believe a modern translation will give you the full flavor of the epic."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30370173-kevin", "userReview": "Lookit, I think it is fairly ridiculous to give this book stars since it has long surpassed ratings or the need of reviews, the tale speaks and exists by itself and on its own terms. If you are not already familiar with the events of the greatest Irish epic that we know of, then I would advise you to get your hands on it. The only elements of the story that readers would fine discouraging would be the excessive lists of place-names and ancestors of people. This is a common trope of Irish myth as they were of immense importance to society and especially to the kings and poets.It is surely the best story in the Irish mythological cycles and is definitely the most well know. The T\u00e1in B\u00f3 C\u00faailnge is legendary and even should a person with no interest in mythology or Ireland will still be entertained by this compelling story of war, honour and betrayal."}, {"userName": "Steve", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/164645-steve", "userReview": "Magnificent.

The hero of the tale is C\u00fachulainn, the Hound of Ulster, who resists the invaders single-handed, while Ulster's warriors lie sick.Thomas Kinsella's presents a complete and living version of the story. His translation is based on the partial texts in two medieval manuscripts, with elements from other version, and adds a group of related stories which prepare for the action of the T\u00e1in.
