How many have you glanced at on the street, seen in a shop, sat opposite and shared a smile with at a concert? Ten thousand? Twenty? Imagine that every person you ever met, ever remembered, has endured after death, kept alive by the power of your memory.This is the central idea around which Kevin Brockmeier has constructed a book of surprising beauty and sadness, a novel different from most of what I read, but rewarding and memorable.Few books stick solidly in my memory. Fewer genuinely hit me in the heart.The Brief History of the Dead did both.In the word that Brockmeier builds there is a more than just this flesh-bound existence. Beyond life in our world there is an afterlife that is effectively a second chance to live again. This post-life life is a vast city, populated by millions of people who have passed on from our world and who work, live, love and play among its streets and buildings.Brockmeier\u2019s afterlife is oddly mundane. There are no big answers, no resolutions. People carry on, and relationships fail, and pain continues. The issues of their lives, their worries and frustrations come with them- they are the same people they always were, in an unfamiliar city populated by the dead.The idea that the dead live on in our memories is a sentiment often heard at funerals, and here Brockmeier makes it a reality. While there are still people on earth who remember you then you continue your second life in the city. When the final person who remembers you passes on then you disappear to no-one knows where, perhaps another afterlife, or perhaps oblivion.But this city of the dead is threatened, at the same time as all human life on earth is endangered too. A virus of terrifying murderousness is sweeping the globe, killing billions, and as each person dies, so the people in the afterlife that they remembered have disappeared too.While the dead wonder what is happening on Earth the still-living Laura Byrd is part of an Antarctic expedition sponsored by Coca Cola, staying in a remote hut with two of her colleagues. As the virus ravages the world Laura\u2019s companions decide to trek to a nearby base to look for other survivors. When they fail to return Laura sets out after them.As Laura begins her lonely struggle across the most inhospitable continent on earth both she and the tens of thousands who live in the city must start to come to terms with what could be not only the end of human civilisation, but the end of the afterlife too.Brockmeier\u2019s book is moving and melancholy, but also somehow uplifting at times despite its end of days feel. His storytelling is deft and he handles the juxtaposition between Laura\u2019s world of ice and ever-threatening death with the bustle of the afterlife city. There is a great deal of pathos here, and some really quite beautiful writing.I found Brockmeier\u2019s afterlife both compelling and alluring, despite its downsides - who wouldn\u2019t like to imagine their relatives living on in another world, waiting for the chance to meet you again while enjoying a second, full span of life? Even my coldly rational atheist\u2019s heart warmed at the prospect of seeing my dear grandparents together again in such a place, and The Brief History of the Dead left me with a sense of sadness and wonder that I have very rarely encountered in fiction."}, {"userName": "Richard Derus", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3920693-richard-derus", "userReview": "Rating: 3.9* of fiveThe Book Description: From Kevin Brockmeier, one of this generation's most inventive young writers, comes a striking new novel about death, life, and the mysterious place in between. The City is inhabited by those who have departed Earth but are still remembered by the living. They will reside in this afterlife until they are completely forgotten. But the City is shrinking, and the residents clearing out. Some of the holdouts, like Luka Sims, who produces the City\u2019s only newspaper, are wondering what exactly is going on. Others, like Coleman Kinzler, believe it is the beginning of the end. Meanwhile, Laura Byrd is trapped in an Antarctic research station, her supplies are running low, her radio finds only static, and the power is failing. With little choice, Laura sets out across the ice to look for help, but time is running out. Kevin Brockmeier alternates these two storylines to create a lyrical and haunting story about love, loss and the power of memory.My Review: I am simply appalled that my cynical shell has been breached by a man who has an MFA from the Iowa Writer's Workshop, and who has been published in McSweeney's, Crazyhorse, and suchlike Writerly Venues.Appalled. But then there's this:Anyone who has ever experienced love knows that you can have too much or too little. You can have love that parches, love that defeats. You can have love measured out in the wrong proportions. It's like your sunlight and water - the wrong kind of love is just as likely to stifle hope as it is to nourish it.That, laddies and gentlewomen, needed saying and needed Brockmeier to say it. It's just that true, and just that beautifully crafted.I hate that.I make merciless fun of, and throw lots of rotten eggs at, the Writerly Writers like Eggers and Franzen and Foster Wallace for their pretty sentences going nowhere new or even all that interesting. Their self-congratulatory cadres, nay myrmidons, attack anyone who dares say, \"yeah, so?\" of the myrmidons' ikons. Why can't Brockmeier have inspired such a slavish, culty following, so that I may point and say, \"but him! He's a good one! He's a Writerly Writer with something *interesting* to say!\"Life is unfair.But anyway. The story is a good one, of dislocation in time and space with all that implies for identity...how do we survive as ourselves even knowing that we aren't in any space ever known to us?...so we're already of to a pleasing start. The Writerly Writing is an enhancement of the basic story, because the sentences being self-consciously pretty and profound make a point about the afterlife. It's a well-used technique in this instance, and doesn't feel show-offy as normally it could or even would.The ending. Well, now, all things have flaws. The important question is, is it a raku pottery crazing-type flaw, or an inclusion-in-the-diamond-type flaw? This will greatly depend on one's point of view of the afterlife. I'm on the fence with this book's ending...and I come down on the raku-pottery side only because I like the rest of the book so much. A different mood, and this would be a three-star review with a sad, impatient growl about the sentimentality of the ending.Lucky Brockmeier.

Add to that list Kevin Brockmeier. I didn't think that a book about the end of human civilization would have any affect on me; my ignorance led me into this novel fully unprepared for what I would encounter. Set in the not-so-distant future, The Brief History of the Dead follows the story of a very big corporate \"oops\": Coca-Cola unintentionally spreads a virus that kills off the entire human population in a very short period of time. Brockmeier manages to stay within the bounds of satire when addressing the Coke folks, and even dredges up some sympathy for the PR managers who must deal with this tragedy. Of course, they don't have time to deal with it before dropping dead of their own creation. The heart of the story revolves around one woman, Laura Byrd, an explorer in Antarctica and the lone survivor of the mass extinction. The novel alternates between her story and the story of The City, the place where souls go after life and before the final resting place. Citizens survive in The City only as long as someone who remembers them is still alive. Laura, alone and unable to make a connection with anyone in the world, is the light that keeps The City alive. As the book spirals toward its inevitable end, Brockmeier reveals hints and anecdotes to connect all the characters. He richly illustrates each connection, unfolding relationships and characters so well drawn that I felt them in the room with me. The undercurrent of urgency stands in stark contrast to the evolution of relationships, the slow burn of a cigarette, a leisurely breakfast. The story ends where I thought it would end, with no fireworks or plot twists, but with a sigh that made me realize I was holding my breath."}, {"userName": "Annet", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166369-annet", "userReview": "I'm still not sure what to think about this book exactly. I bought the book because I found the theme and story line extremely intriguing. It makes you think... about 'life after death', about a virus situation spreading over the world beyond control, about relationships and memories... How can someone think of a story line like this? Wow! It's in between fantasy and real life, this one. So... I started reading, and the beginning was intriguing and promising, but somehow the story didn't 'catch' me really. I did like the concept of the two separate storylines and how they seem to intertwine the further you come into the book, and there are some good moments in the book, very well written and food for thought, but at times I also found the story slow and dragging.... The theme however, again, brilliantly found.

The first chapter--establishing a vast city of the recently dead, an afterlife for everyone still remembered by the living--is amazing and beautiful. The second chapter flies off in another direction entirely, and plants us firmly in the ice and snow of antarctica. From there the novel alternates: each odd-numbered chapter explores the city of the dead from a new character's perspective, while the even-numbered chapters follow the adventures of the woman in Antarctica, Laura Byrd, who seems to be the last living person in the world. If this structure sounds like too difficult a balancing act to maintain, that's because it is. Brockmeier holds things together in the first half, but before too long he's grasping to fill out the length of the novel. The stories of the city remain interesting, if hard to believe, for a while. People there listen to music and eat food that comes from...well, from nowhere, apparently. And back in the real world, Laura Byrd journeys from one station to the next, across a vast wasteland of ice and snow. Her scenes are so painfully and poetically protracted that one could easily skip three and four pages at a time without missing anythng but descriptions of frostbitten extremities and an unvaried landscape. The prose is beautiful in the first half and rounds back into top form in the final quarter of the book, which may sustain some readers' engagement. By the anticlimactic ending, though, this \"novel\" feels like two excellent short stories stretched far beyond their breaking points, and The Brief History of the Dead ultimately fails to be brief enough."}, {"userName": "Oceana2602", "userReviewDate": "Mar 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/177596-oceana2602", "userReview": "Here's the story how I came by the best book I read in 2007:So I'm standing at King's Cross station, waiting for a friend of mine to arrive by train.

The recently departed whose time on earth overlapped with people still here are the sasha, the living-dead. They are not wholly dead, for they still live in the memories of the living, who can call them to mind, create their likeness in art, and bring them to life in anecdote. When the last person to know an ancestor dies, that ancestor leaves the sasha for the zamani, the dead. As generalized ancestors, the zamani are not forgotten but revered. Many...can be recalled by name. But they are not living-dead. There is a difference.\u201d One thing's for sure, I will never read this twice. There's a certain consuming hopelessness about it, a helpless resignation which does not do well to the soul.It presents a sad perspective on existence: after death, life gets no more better than before. Brockmeier brilliantly portraits this idea of lifeless afterlife, people doing everyday things because they're used to doing them, not because they have to be done anymore. They wander through the city like night walkers in their sleep: being there, but not really there. The narration is largely constructed from the inside of characters' minds, so you will know what each of them is thinking about. This can get tedious after a time, especially when they start hallucinating. Other people's dreams are always sterile.I remarked a disconsolate solitude of the characters. Despite living all together in one city, they are incredibly lonely, like roles in someone else's dream. I wouldn't wish for such an afterlife. Their lives are pieced together from fragments; death is not the end, nor a new beginning, but a painful and slow attempt at existing.\"The game had to be played the same way every day or the pieces would fall to the floor, the board would collapse, and the illusion that you were shaping your own life, that you were in control, would break.\u201d I'll go read some Chesterton to purge my mind of all this unwanted pessimism."}, {"userName": "Trudi", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1416912-trudi", "userReview": "This book started out brilliantly with a wonderfully unique premise.

The book didn't displease me, but it never left the blocks of its central conceit: there's a city you go to when you die, populated by those still remembered by the living. You know that from the dust jacket, and it seems like fruitful territory for some Italo Calvino-esque slices of city life, but Brockmeier keeps his cast relatively small and his narrative surprisingly linear, short, and ultimately unsatisfying. There still seems like opportunity for some straightforward storytelling: how many are left alive? How and why was the disease unleashed? What lies beyond the city? But these avenues go unexplored, or are dealt with in anticlimax.So what's the point of this dystopia? This isn't a contemplation on depravity and whittled hope like Cormac McCarthy's The Road (life in the city is too cushy). Neither is it the possibly-rotten future-present pie of a George Saunders story (not as funny or as well-written). One dust jacket reviewer described it as \"an elegy for how we live now,\" but I didn't come away with any sense of the author's feelings on the significance (or insignificance) of humanity's life and times, or its passing.The NYTimes review is decent, if harsh: \"The bold premise at the heart of 'The Brief History of the Dead' could have offered the best sorts of complex pleasures, narrative and metaphysical, that science fiction has to offer.

Kevin Brockmeier takes this sentiment and envisions a world in which it is literally true. As such, The Brief History of the Dead makes for a unique take on the idea of life and death, as well as a poignant testimony to the power of memory. For the dearly departed, there is no heaven or hell in this world of Brockmeier's imagination. Although the crossing can be extremely difficult, each soul finds his/her way to a magnificent City. Apart from the City's mysterious ability to expand in such a way that the newly arrived always have a place to live and work, it proves to be much like Earth. Many of its denizens take up the same kind of life they used to live, performing the same jobs and reuniting with loved ones who have also passed on, while others choose to reinvent themselves. After 60 or 70 years, many of them quietly disappear, but most are too busy living their own lives to really worry about their own distant future. It soon becomes clear, however, that those in the City remain there only as long as they exist in the living memories of individuals on Earth. The great City undergoes drastic changes when a deadly virus back on Earth begins claiming the lives of a majority of the living world's population. Our only window into this futuristic Earth comes through the eyes of wildlife specialist Laura Byrd, but she could not be more isolated from the infection. Laura is in fact stranded on her own in a hut in deepest Antarctica, having had the rotten luck to be selected as one of three team members sent down there by the publicity-happy Coca-Cola Corporation to explore methods for using pure Antarctic ice in the manufacture of its product (which doesn't sound so crazy once you hear about the environmental problems of this futuristic Earth). Having lost their communications equipment to the elements, Laura's teammates set out for the nearest research station, promising to come back for her. That was over three weeks ago. With the hut's heating coils finally failing, Laura has no choice but to set out on her own. What follows is a visceral and engrossing survival story that would have done Jack London proud. As Laura struggles to survive, the denizens of the City find themselves drastically reduced in number. When they realize they each have a connection to Laura Byrd, it doesn't take a genius to figure out that every other man, woman, and child on Earth is now dead. The big question is what will happen to the remaining denizens of the City once Laura herself dies. The reader will find this question almost as meaningful as the characters themselves, for Brockmeier makes you a part of their precarious afterlife. Two in particular, a journalism professor who had an affair with a young Laura and one of Laura's childhood friends, are wonderfully evocative characters who serve as the author's primary sounding boards for his speculative ideas of memory vis-\u00e0-vis human interaction and its implications for life (and even afterlife) itself. It's a fascinating novel, but the conclusion may prove a little disappointing to some, for one could say that it ends with a whimper rather than a bang. As a reader, one cannot help but want more than Brockmeier gives us in the end, but I find it hard to criticize a book or its author on those terms. No matter what you think of the conclusion, The Brief History of the Dead is a poignant literary journey offering readers a unique perspective on some of the deepest questions of life and death."}, {"userName": "Res", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56479-res", "userReview": "The one where when people die, they go to live in \"the city\" until no living person remembers them. Meanwhile, on earth, things are turning out very badly.I loved the short story that became the first chapter. And there are so many beautifully observed moments that I found the book quite enjoyable while I was reading it. It was only afterwards that doubts began to creep up.The real-world part of the story has two major implausibilities in it: why the company would consolidate its production into one facility in one country, and why Laura would leave the nice, safe polar station once she finally found it. Of course the answer to both these questions is, \"Because the plot depends on it,\" but the in-story answers are not convincing. I loved the city of the dead when I read the short story. I loved the vagueness of its geography and economics and weather, and the way people came and went with no warning as you gradually understood what sort of city it was and what kept people there. At novel length, though, I started wanting questions answered. There's one beggar and one crazy person, and we see one beating, but in a place where no one can die, there's no crime? No lootings, no arson, no vandalism, no muggings, not even reckless driving? In a place where there's no pregnancy or sexually transmitted disease, there are no orgies, no public sex? Children arrive with no parents, and no one abuses them? For that matter, who's going to devote sixty or seventy years to caring for a three-year-old who will never be four? And why O why does the one and only violent crime we see have be committed by the only two non-heterosexual people in the world?It's interesting to compare this city to Bellona in Samuel Delany's  Dhalgren -- both are cities cut off from the world, in which normal cause and effect sometimes don't apply, but the city of the dead seems unrealistically lacking in id, while Bellona is all id and nothing else.

A plague (which was indirectly started by Coca-Cola) is killing off the entire population of the earth, and the city of the living dead is emptying out. Eventually, only Laura Byrd, a scientist who was on a publicity stunt expedition to Antarctica, is left alive on earth and only the people she knew are \"alive\" in the city.This should have been a character driven story, and it turns into a disappointing thriller. I felt like Brockmeier wasted way too much time on Laura's struggle for survival. We know already she's going to die and there is no tension to it, because in this universe, we know that there is life after death. Then in the city of the dead half of the book, he spreads the story out between too many characters and I didn't develop a strong connection to any of them so I couldn't feel any sense of worry about their final deaths.

I thought the beginning few chapters were great and I loved hearing all about the world of the departed (although not the part of 'how' they got there....that was a bit psychedelic).I was probably more interested in the dead than I was in Laura Byrd, although even the chapters given over to Laura were interesting at the start, just not 'as' interesting. As chapters went by though, I was tempted to skim her sections because there's only so much I need to know about an abandoned woman in the Antarctic with only herself for company and little in the way of resources.By three quarters of the way in I was finding the afterlife sections disappointing too. The religious zealot's chapters were too 'out there' for me to relate to and some of the other characters were neither hateful nor lovable...they were just filler.But it's the ending that is the most dissatisfying. It was a letdown of an ending but by the time I'd reached it I was almost past caring what happened anyway.It was a quick, short read that seemed to be far more 'wordy' than was necessary. It's also quite a deep book, considering it's size, but that's not really what I look for when I read.... I want to be entertained by a story and I'm not necessarily looking for a deeper meaning"}, {"userName": "Marvin", "userReviewDate": "May 31, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2160536-marvin", "userReview": "A moving story that explores the power of memory, the significance of loss, and the meaning of our existence. While reading this novel I was constantly reminded of Berkeley's \"If a tree falls in the forest\" question. Certainly many of us want to know that our life have meaning, perhaps even remembered beyond our existence. I think these are the ideas Brockmeier is playing with and of course he has no real answer but the route he takes is one mesmerizing journey. Two separate stories are revealed with both of them gently weaved together. The first one is about a city where the dead live until they are no longer remembered by those on earth and then disappear into a unknown future. This story meanders like a philosophical but casual conversation as the city empties leaving only a few thousand left to wonder why. The other story evolves around Laura Byrd who is trapped in an Antarctica station and may be the only living survivor of Earth. This story reads like an adventure tale as Laura tries to survive and find out what happened to the rest of the world. I like the contrast between the tales. Yet the journey is the thing. Those who criticize the lack of resolution in this novel are missing the point. This is a novel of questions not answers."}, {"userName": "A.W.

And it's much more fun writing about stuff I've enjoyed anyway, so there!Guess what? That's right, I loved this book! I normally employ a know-nothing-in-advance technique in which I ensure I've not read any reviews or even read the blurb on the back, because I like everything to be up for discovery. I'm very glad I did so in this case because it's very much a premise-driven book and even though you find out fairly early what's going on, it was nice to just be eased into it.So on that basis I won't say much more (although if you've got to the stage of reading about it on goodreads you'll already know the premise, oh well). I love the idea of there being lots of shopkeepers, we all remember shopkeepers without even knowing it!It's funny and sad and extremely charming. Kevin Brockmeier depicts tragedy in such a matter of fact way, that it seems to heighten the impact. He's similar to George Saunders in that way. Ooh, I've not reviewed any George Saunders have I?Let's get waxing lyrical...."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11252810-debbie", "userReview": "I'm so glad I found this book! The story is that I was trying to find something else and ran across this book in perfect condition that I do not remember purchasing. Inside was even a postcard of the cover from Pantheon Books.

Brockmeier gives us Coca-Cola as unintentional doom-bringer. The mega-corp manages to spring a lethal virus on humanity, killing off the entire planet in no time. Their attempts to spin the catastrophe bring a dark, cynical humor into the mix.Brockmeier paints a very imaginitive picture of the city of the dead, a limbo-like place where souls go after death and stay until everyone who remembers them is dead. As the virus sweeps the planet, the population of the city explodes. But as the casualties mount, and the people left to remember the dead become fewer and fewer, the city of the dead depopulates rapidly. One woman, Antarctic explorer Laura Byrd, hangs on as the lone survivor of the plague. Her memories are all that keep the city of the dead alive.Since passionate affairs and relationships form between these dead people, you can imagine the deep depression that sets in as loved ones and entire communities disappear. The tone is heavy, and I found myself reflecting the deflated mood as I read the story.Not surprisingly, questions about ultimate origins and destinations began to surface for me. Where are these dead people going when they disappear from limbo? And what afterlife-related fate awaits Laura as the last, and therefore unremembered, person on Earth? What does it say that the forgettable disappear before the memorable? Is Brockmeier commenting on the Beatitudes, or teachings that \"the last shall be first, and the first last\"? Do all disappeared souls end up in the same place? Brockmeier left me with plenty of questions to ponder.The ending is far from surprising, but not completely predictable either. I found myself wanting just a bit more clarity, though I appreciate Brockmeier letting me fill in some of the blanks myself.In all, a moody, passion-filled, stressful, grey-toned, worthwhile read."}, {"userName": "Alb", "userReviewDate": "Apr 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/358322-alb", "userReview": "I just finished this book and now I need to go to CuteOverload.com and stare at pictures of puppies before I wander drained of all hope into on-coming traffic. Phew somebody please buy Kevin Brockmeir a balloon bouquet or give him a hug because this guy needs cheering up. I mean don't get me wrong, I like lots of sad, bleak books and I actually think the fatalistic ending was logical and necessary but throw me an interesting charater or a meaningful, complicated relationship every couple of hundred chapters to go with my bowl of cold, greedy, blind-boy kicking, cruel humanity. Had I actually read this book and not listened to the audio book I would have stopped reading after the first 100 pages I am sure and that's the main reason I gave it 2 stars. The effort of actually reading this would not have been worth it. However, the book was not without redeeming qualities, I was the most engaged when he explored the emotional life of the citizens of the City and I wanted more of that, such as Puckett searching for what became of his long-dead brother and the relationship between Puckett and Joyce. I also appreciate the writing, although at times it felt self-important and of course the premise itself is utterly beautiful and very thought provoking I just think the author needed more praise as a child:) and maybe a coke;). I also can't help wondering if a certain beverage company is a little peeved at him."}, {"userName": "Gijs Grob", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/544212-gijs-grob", "userReview": "'The Brief History of the Dead' is partly an apocalyptic future novel, akin to 'War With the Newts' or 'On the Beach'. Like in those two books, human existence is wiped out by a destruction force of its own design.Brockmeier, however, is not interested in the process of destruction itself, but focuses on the last survivor, biologist Laura Byrd, who's utterly alone on the Antarctic. Curiously, though, her adventures are altered with the description of a city where people go to after they die. These chapters are of a striking originality and even more interesting than Laura's desperate struggles on the South Pole. From the onset it's clear how these two stories are linked, which makes 'The Brief History of the Dead' rather predictive. That the book is a page-turner nonetheless shows Brockmeier's narrative skills. Even though one knows how the novel ends, one cannot stop reading it.If the novel knows one fault, it's a lack of inner logic, which e.g. makes the end a little disappointing. However, 'The Brief History of the Dead' is a rewarding read, full of vivid pictures, lovely scenes, and a strong sense of melancholy. Highly recommended."}], "description": "From Kevin Brockmeier, one of this generation's most inventive young writers, comes a striking new novel about death, life, and the mysterious place in between. The City is inhabited by those who have departed Earth but are still remembered by the living. They will reside in this afterlife until they are completely forgotten. But the City is shrinking, and the residents clearing out. Some of the holdouts, like Luka Sims, who produces the City\u2019s only newspaper, are wondering what exactly is going on. Others, like Coleman Kinzler, believe it is the beginning of the end. Meanwhile, Laura Byrd is trapped in an Antarctic research station, her supplies are running low, her radio finds only static, and the power is failing. With little choice, Laura sets out across the ice to look for help, but time is running out. Kevin Brockmeier alternates these two storylines to create a lyrical and haunting story about love, loss and the power of memory.", "title": "The Brief History of the Dead", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30072.The_Brief_History_of_the_Dead", "average": 3.67, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386925109l/30072.jpg", "reviews": 1684, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/16967.Kevin_Brockmeier", "name": "Kevin Brockmeier"}], "type": ["Fantasy", "Science Fiction", "Fiction", "Apocalyptic"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30072.The_Brief_History_of_the_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/577271.The_Brief_History_of_the_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/755806.The_Brief_History_of_the_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6357281-the-brief-history-of-the-dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8472655-the-illumination", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1443836.The_View_from_the_Seventh_Layer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/109339.Things_that_Fall_from_the_Sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/109340.The_Truth_About_Celia", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18630655-a-few-seconds-of-radiant-filmstrip", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19755140-embassytown", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32858845-off-to-be-the-wizard", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33616599-beneath-the-shine", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10931746-the-stepford-wives", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22583196-time-s-divide", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13604418-the-long-earth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20526820-gilded", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26580636-infinity-lost", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34111309-the-man-of-legends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31139576-all-the-breaking-waves", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193375-fellside", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18108877-timebound", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25071002-the-banished-of-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204943-muirwood", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18806963-prayers-to-broken-stones", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18126623-2061", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29425329-alas-babylon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193696-3001", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205002-fractured", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29103028-the-queen-s-poisoner", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40269681-zeroes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18162904-dreams-and-shadows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36316055-touch-of-eternity", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35106805-touch", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192858-dragon-rider", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25353286-provenance", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23249416-an-unwelcome-quest"]}
