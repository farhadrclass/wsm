As a reader I find that prequels can be fraught with risk and I often find myself asking questions like:Is this just a grab for some cash? If it is so important to the story the why not include it in the first book? Will it add any value to the story and series?Is this a result of lazy story development?What I got in this prequel was a valued pack story that not only added to the series but stood alone as a separate story. Mark Tufo has nodded his cap to his readership by adding some great tongue in cheek references to the series. The book tells the tale of the discovery of the virus that will one day bring the world to its knees and adds a tantalizing link and teaser to what is to come in the series. I for one want to know what the hell is in that suitcase.I always come away from Mr Tufo's books feeling greatly entertained and for some reason craving pop tarts. For those of you yet to sample what this author has to offer it's time you jump in with both feet and immerse yourself in his world."}, {"userName": "Katie Kenig", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/841891-katie-kenig", "userReview": "Oh, for heaven's sake.Alright, I know I said I was taking a break from this series because I was getting a bit burnt out on them, but since this was a prequel, I thought I'd give it a shot. I'm not particularly happy that I did.This short novella, tucked between books three and four of the series, gives some history of the virus that causes the Zombie Apocalypse in the Fallout series. It follows Dr. Hugh Mann (yes, it's really that ridiculous), a physicist around the turn of the 20th century, who discovers a tiny race of humans that are engaged in a full-out war with dust mites.I'm actually not kidding.Without the humour that peppers the other books in this series, I found this novella falling flat for me. The history was so outrageous, so impossible to quell the stirrings of \"Too far\" in my brain, that I couldn't turn on the suspension of disbelief that makes zombie novels so much fun to read. I feel like the author was trying to take things too seriously (beyond the name which was too punny for me). The fact that he was, additionally, supposed to be a family ancestor of the main characters in the series, and that he had met Tommy just pushed it too far for me.My brain snapped. I could almost hear it. I listened to this on audiobook, and it's short - about three hours - and it occupied me while I was doing housework. If I'd been reading this instead of listening, I wouldn't have made it through. If I hadn't had other things to occupy my thoughts as well while listening, I wouldn't have made it through. What was the author thinking? Just... why?Okay, usually I'm all about the in-between novellas in a series, but not here. Don't do it. Don't read it. If you are enjoying this series? Just keep reading the regular books. This is not worth three hours of your life. You can't get those hours back, man! Pet a cat or go for a walk or listen to some bad music instead. You'll thank me someday, I think."}, {"userName": "Rusty Duncan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3192771-rusty-duncan", "userReview": "wtf?Look, I have read a lot of zombie novels. A LOT of zombie novels, not all of which have (surprise) been Pulitzer material. Many were in dire need of an editor; some begged for a spell checker (c'mon folks it's 2014 for goodness sakes - press F7 at least once), while others took themselves way too seriously (Rambo Conquers the Zombies).What I love about these books so far is the generous infusion of sarcasm and humor that MT uses to bring his protagonist to life. I really did enjoy books 1-3.This is even though I'm not especially a fan of zombies with supernatural powers or sinister purposes. But I can tolerate this, for the 'greater good' of the novel/series - up to a point. See Monster Island series by David Wellington.Unfortunately, this prequel goes up to that point and skids out past the cliff's edge, like Wiley Coyote in a Roadrunner cartoon (cue the handheld sign - BYE - and the cloud of dust).So, after tolerating the sketch behavior of the zombies and other supernatural heavies in the first three books of this series, I now discover in this book that the entire premise of Zombie Fallout (its \"raison d'mortre\", if you will) is SO STUPID that I can't go on.I don't give up easily on books. It's part of my stubborn nature to soldier through many a lost literary cause, even if the forecast is for extensive crap starting at page five.Part of being a zombie hugger is the ability to 'drink the Kool-Aid', to join in the mantra \"I do believe in fairies - er, zombies - I do, I do, I do\". But I do not believe in fairies, and I do NOT believe in these zombies, Sam I Am. Not on a boat, not with a goat, and definitely not for another three books.Farewell Zombie Fallout - the fallout is permanent!"}, {"userName": "Vix", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7521915-vix", "userReview": "am a massive fan of Mark Tufo so maybe a little bias in my review.... but this little novella in the story line is a wonderful little rounding out of certain characters... a great new twist in how Zombies are caused.....very clever really! really felt for all the characters as was charmed to read about the lovely Tommy always with humour... another great part of the magnificent ZF world"}, {"userName": "Unapologetic_Bookaholic", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1125077-unapologetic-bookaholic", "userReview": "I was not disappointed with this book.

Marrying Jonathon Talbot a month prior, her father leaves a suitcase with them, them being unknown to the secrets kept within. Tommy, or Tomas faked selling pastries to gain access to their home in order to steal the suitcase and hide it for close to a decade. It wasn't until twelve years later, when Dr. Hugh Mann dies, does Tommy tell Marissa that locket she wore, belonged to his sister who would come after her to retrieve it, as well as return the suitcase the military was so armament of having.Then in late 1980s, scientists at area 51, began experiment on prisoners of war, like murders, child molesters and repeat. One subject, Named Sam, after receiving a swab, became infected immediately and bit a scientist in the room, infecting him as well. In order to contain it, the room was set a blaze.Lastly, in 2010, four men working for a senator of the United States, stole the H1N1 virus from a military base, planning on using power to start the apocalypse.

Dr. Hugh Mann is a scientist with a university in the early 1900\u2019s. After the arrival of a new high-powered microscope, he discovers something amazing in a sample of blood. A big university fund raising events gets planned around this discovery and the discovery takes on a life of its own. In this story we meet Dr. Mann\u2019s daughter who turns out to be Mike Talbots grandmother. And, of course, the military takes a disastrous interest in Dr. Mann\u2019s discovery.I was very skeptical at the start of this story about how it would fit in with the series and why Mark Tufo had written it. However, with continued listening I decided the story is absolute genius and fits very well. Sean Runnette excellent reading enhances the story. If you are reading the Zombie Fallout Series, don\u2019t skip this Volume 3.5. If you aren\u2019t reading the series, but enjoy Zombie stories, you need to read this series. You won\u2019t regret it.

Having not read the other Zombie Fallout books, I decided to read the prequel first. The few parts that were unexplained in this book I assume to be explained in the other books, but otherwise I could read this book without any difficulty. This book was short enough to read in one sitting, and was interesting enough to do so. I would probably recommend this book for somebody who already has read the previous books, considering there are certain things that might confuse somebody who hasn't read the other books. The one question I still have is how the human beings (\"Hugh Manns\") were actually created in the first place. I could not find that answer to that question in the book, though the explanation for that may be in later books.Overall, I would recommend this book for people with an interest in the series, but mainly those who have already read at least some books in the Zombie Fallout series."}, {"userName": "Linda", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6213718-linda", "userReview": "*** An excellent addition to an excellent Series ***It's almost as if Mark gave us a present in releasing Dr. Hugh Mann. He must have known we were 'jonesing' for his writing. Thank you Mark! Although it's a prequel, if you're new to the series, read this AFTER book 3. This is from someone else's review of the ZF series, but I couldn't say it any better and thoroughly agree: Cumulatively, they are an epic apocalyptic tale, which reminded me of Steven King's The Stand and Robert McCammon's Swan Song. Elements of horror, paranormal, supernatural, and dark humor elevate this series beyond your typical zombie fare. These elements, along with Mike's quirky personality & fierce, protective love of his companions, make this series poignant and worth reading. Highly recommended. I am so excited for ZF 4 to arrive in October."}, {"userName": "Susu", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5202097-susu", "userReview": "Wonderful story of the true origin of the zombie fallout. My reaction to this novella was like a slap to a hysterical person. At first I was like, 'Wait! Where is Mike, Tommy, Alex, Paul?' I even thought to myself 'Maybe I'll just skip the story and go right to the next book and come back to it.' Again my OCD comes into play preventing me from reading out of order.By the end of the book my thinking is more along the lines of 'Wow, I needed that'.Very interesting if not scarily realistic possibility of the virus' conception and utilization. And of course its nice to see that Tommy hasn't changed at all over the years.After this brief detour I am ready to jump back into the fallout and see where we go from here."}, {"userName": "Amanda Felix", "userReviewDate": "Mar 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17820136-amanda-felix", "userReview": "Well now we know what really started the ZF and how Michael Talbot gets involved. Dr. Hugh Mann is as arrogant and egotistical as a genius could be. However even his maniacal ego is brought down by his discovery. At first he is elated and wants to share the news then he realizes the mistake he has made when trying to confide in a fellow scientest. Every thing spirals down really fast after that. If you are a fan of the ZF series, you will enjoy this and it will give the reader a pleasant surprise as to how Michael Talbot is involved. Some of the history of how it all began is not surprising to me but it does connect the past to the present.
