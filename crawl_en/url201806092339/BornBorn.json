Check - A girl whose objective is to survive? Check - Her father is dead? Check - Girl is very handy with a bow and arrow? Check - Girl falls for two guys? Check - Girl falls for one guy whilst nursing him back to health? (*cough* Cave scene *cough*) Check - Girl incessantly ponders over whom she loves more? Check - Girl seems to be the only person able to save anybody? Check - Main girl befriends a younger girl under dangerous circumstances? Check - One guy is dark and brooding? Check - One guy is friendly and charming? Check - The brooding guy is better at tracking and using weapons? Check - The people choose the girl to lead their rebellion? Check - Girl has no qualms over leading both guys on for a prolonged period of time? Check - People in white coats = bad? Check - There is a city where people live in comfort and can access luxuries? Check - Girl is self-destructive? Check - The phrases \"rise out of the ashes\", \"Phoenix\", and \"wings\" are used? CheckThe only things missing were a Mockingjay costume, light-up screens, a loaf of bread and a drunk mentor.Also, she had terrible taste in men. Yep - fall in love with the guy who manhandles you, hurts you, belittles you, and then tells you he loves you. Because that, ladies, is the very height of romance*!\n*(heavy sarcasm)As well as her inability to tell an asshole from a gentleman, the main heroine is also oddly happy with punching shooting kicking slicing dicing scarring hitting clawing whacking hurting people. It's like she gets a thrill out of it or something.\nBut when karma comes along and bites at her heels, she gets all scared and introverted. Yeah, one of the guys she likes is a jerk. But it's not like she treats him that well either. She punches him. Yells at him. Oh, and likes his brother. Did I mention that this book includes highly dysfunctional relationships?By now you're probably all like:But I promise, there are some good aspects of this novel. Some of its concepts are unique and well-developed, and you have to admit that both guys are extremely good-looking and swoon worthy. Well. I'm off to read the next book in this series. Fingers crossed it doesn't include a guy in a fishnet, sugar cubes, fake pregnancies, sham engagements, rum and an arena shaped like a clock ;)"}, {"userName": "Carol (StarAngel's Reviews) Allen", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6294320-carol-starangel-s-reviews-allen", "userReview": "I don't really think this is your typical zombie story...there isn't much of that in the book at all. I would categorize this more of a dystopian with an annoying heroine.Em can be annoying one minute and then a kick ass fighter, who constantly has my head spinning.I enjoyed the story once I got past the short sentences and the rough reading flow.Definitely a trilogy I want to know more about.

She meets a bunch of boring people and they all instantly become best friends. No joke. They then continue on to do a bunch of other stuff like free a breeding camp and whatnot.~Warning, before reading, this review is going to be more of a rant. Also, I might give away some of the plot if you still plan on reading it.~Usually, books always have some sort of redeeming quality like a lovable character, or an intriguing plot-line, but I can honestly say I didn\u2019t find any in this book. I had to give myself a pep-talk in order to finish this book and only so that I could chew the book apart in this review. It didn\u2019t flow, or fit together, and basically all of the characters were annoying and had unrealistic personalities. The characterization was non-existent, and I really didn\u2019t like the choppy writing style.Let\u2019s start with the characters, shall we? Reading the book in Emma\u2019s point of view was like reading the book in the POV of a rock. I honestly don\u2019t even really know what her personality is or even what she looks like other than what\u2019s on the cover, but she apparently has the ability to attract every person she encounters in some sort of romantic way like a boring insta-love magnet. I mean, is she just the most attractive girl in the world or what? Even a sort-of married woman put the moves on her. Emma fell in love with Will and Jake faster than I could even say insta-love. For someone who\u2019s grown up telling herself not to trust anyone, she sure did trust everyone she met. Besides Emma, for being able to break the record for \u201chaving-a-girl-fall-in-love-with-you-the-fastest\u201d Will and Jake sure are underdeveloped characters. So from what I read, Jake is funny and Will is serious and. . . that\u2019s it. That\u2019s all the personality they had. I honestly don\u2019t see how so many people gave this book such high ratings on Goodreads!Next, I want to talk about the writing style. Did no one else notice that this book was written for a 3rd grader? The sentences were choppy and short.Now I may be paraphrasing and/or exaggerating here:I look out the field. I don\u2019t see anything in the field. I stand up and climb down the tree. I start walking through the field. I make it across the field . . .Am explaining this well enough?I\u2019m assuming the author did this to make the scenes seem intense but it really didn\u2019t come across that way for me. The action sequences were confusing and there really was no description of the world they\u2019re living in or even what the infected looked like. What I\u2019m saying is that the imagery, or lack thereof, was very bland.The last thing I want to talk about is the plot-line. I could go on for days about all the things I didn\u2019t like about this book but I\u2019m not going to do that. I honestly don\u2019t like giving low ratings on books and tearing them apart with all the things I didn\u2019t like about them. I swear. The plot of this book had WAAAYYY too many \u201cconveniences\u201d. Oh hey, look, I\u2019m in need of another pair of boots, it just so happens I have like 6 extra pairs right here in the barn!. . . or. . . Oh hey, I need a way to ruin the government run facilities in order to free all the women being used as and eggo-preggo machine. Oh hey look, every building has a self destruct button in the basement. How CONVENIENT! Not only are there conveniences, but it seems that the characters are able to read each-others minds. The characters never seemed to talk about what to do next but they were always on the same page. The author left out so much communication that I felt like there was a very large gap in the story. In fact, it seemed that the things that happened in a matter of days should have been spread out over a period of months. Example 1: People have magical healing powers. No not literally, but if one character is shot or stabbed or cut, they\u2019ll be fine the next day to run or jump as if they had never been injured. Example 2: As soon as Emma met Anna and Jake, she talked about how much she cared about them. And then when they were in the second house, Emma talks about how much she loves Jake . . . Well . . . that escalated quickly. That kind of relationship should have been spread out over a period of months. AmIRite? And seriously, are there really two more of these books? . . .I have more to say. . . stop ranting Sheradyn! . . . but I have more to say! . . . NO! Stop ranting! . . . but..but..Okay . . .I honestly don\u2019t recommend this book. I seem to be a minority in my feelings toward it considering most people gave it 4 or 5 stars on GR. So I guess if you think you might enjoy it more than me then what the hay, go for it. Either way, Keep Calm and . . .READ ON!-Sheradyn"}, {"userName": "Ornella (Nyx)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6282007-ornella-nyx", "userReview": "This book has a lot of things going for it, like the characters, the premise, the action, and just the awesomeness of Emma. The downside: the romance...Emma is an incredibly strong character, she does what needs to be done, she survives at all costs, she is fierce and she is loyal, but unfortunately when it comes to relationships, it just isn't gonna happen. She has been alone for the majority of her life so it stands to reason that the girl is a bit of an antisocial, which is fine, my problems were her love interests. I can see why she would like both of them, but my god, she came about the loving part wayyy too fast, and she was going back and forth like with her decisions like every 5mins and Will is such an ASS! I really didn't like him. He is overbearing, always manhandling her and a player. And Jack was the complete opposite to the point of being useless. The kid was just there to lighten the mood basically. So even though I really don't like Will I also knew that there was no way in hell she was picking Jack either.Besides all that, Emma totally kicks ass, she is damn independent and can think for herself and follows her instincts. I think my favorite character would have to be Leo though. He is just awesome!The reason behind the messed up world is something I can actually see happening and I can't wait to see how this will develop."}, {"userName": "Theresa Davis", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14734843-theresa-davis", "userReview": "I have to admit that I got the book because it was free and really didn't think it would be good but I love dystopian books. I LOVED it!!! And I cannot wait for part 2. The Characters are all great. Poor Emma has no really social because she was a lone for so many years, it\u2019s us and them. When you throw in Anna (who is sweet and strong), Jake (no survival skills but is funny and caring) and Will (who is not sure how to treat Emma but knows he want to protect her) you have an interesting and funny mix. Oh don't forget the love triangle between Will and Jake. I find myself rooting for Will but I am not counting Jake out just yet. The cliffhanger at the end was a surprise but yet it wasn't!

(Shoot me, i had a husband free weekend and an entire weekend by myself and enjoyed every second of it)Born,.. what can I say about this book to adequately say all that needs to be said about the beginning of this series. I don't know if i can and give it the review it deserves. What i can say is that Ms. Brown created a world (a bit like the walking dead series and a smidge of hunger games-ish) through her story telling that was beyond real. I loved the the lead character (Emma) who is strong and independent yet incredibly sweet and giving despite all her years alone with nothing and no-one but her trusty companion wolf friend. If shit like this were to really go down, i'd totally want Emma on my team. No doubt.The people she encounters along the way vary, but none stick out like Jake, Anna and then later Will (all siblngs mind you). Anna was a hoot and a girl anyone would quickly want to be friends with, a sweet little thing with a whole lotta sass and kick-butt qualities. Jake- what a sweetie, potential boy-toy material for our girl Emma (But i don't know, he seems more brotherly to me. A great catch and all but he doesn't have the sizzle... i know, i know,.. there are probably some that may disagree with me.) Yes- he's sweet. Yes- he's got it bad for Emma, and Yes- he' sounds hot,.. But kinda pansy-ish to me-Now Will on the other hand. Hello,.. Playa...But damn, i think i love that boy. He's got just enough gumption and fight to hold his own against our hard-headed and stubborn girl and takes no prisoners. He's balls to the wall and ready to go at any time and regardless of the situations fights with OR against Emma for what is right. He definitely doesn't take her shit. which in my humble opinion is exactly what she needs. (yes it's my opinion, Don't kill me)But he's who i would choose, if i were in Emma's shoes. He's all man! True we'd have to chat about his playa ways, but hell it's the zombie-apocolypse for christ sakes, can you blame the guy. gotta get it while you can!Any way enough of my crazy rambling.

And the best part is that she does it for only one reason, unlike so many female leads in stories in this genre: because it's the right thing to do. That's not to say there isn't a love interest...or two. And those two are definitely worth a bit of lust and/or confusion. But it's not the driving factor of the story, and that makes a big difference to the legitimacy of the plot. Post-apocalyptic, with gross, scary zombies and humans that may be worse than any monster we can imagine, friendships and bonds, fickle human emotions, action like crazy, and an underlying purpose, Born is a fantastic start to a series, and I can't wait to read the next one."}, {"userName": "Hollie", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11216149-hollie", "userReview": "I can't believe I read this whole thing. I should have declared it a DNF. I was looking forward to a book with a tough heroine fighting her way through the apocalypse. While Em was a badass (although to the point of being unrealistic), the plot was ridiculous (and skipped around with huge gaps), the characters are repulsive, and the writing style was lacking. Throw in a love triangle amongst brothers, insta-love (twice), and a cliffhanger ending and this is what you get. A total clusterfuck. Not to mention, one of Em's love interest, Will, was such an unredeemable asshole. He got with another women. Was physically abusive. I mean come on. Needless to say I won't be continuing this series or recommending this book. The high ratings for this book make no sense.

My main reason for slogging through that much of it was the protagonist, Emma, who is bad. ass. I love her. She might get scared, but she's tough as nails and keeps going. I also loved the world building: Emma's post-apocalyptic world is gritty, tense, and creepy. So why did I abandon it? Easy: not enough proofreading. The book reads like a second, maybe third, draft. Almost done, but not there. Ms. Brown has a serious prejudice against commas, and way too often, questions had periods at the end of them instead of question marks. It got to the point where I had to reread statements several times to make sense of what was being said. Considering how highly it's being rated, I'm surprised more reviewers aren't mentioning the obvious grammatical problems. I have the feeling I would love this book it were more polished, but as it is, I plan on returning it to Amazon for a refund."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7591340-sarah", "userReview": "(Source: Downloaded for free from amazon.co.uk.)This was a really good zombie/post-apocalyptic story, and there was plenty of action!I liked the characters in this, but boy did they get into trouble a lot!

The characters just went from one bad situation to the next, barely making it out alive in places.There was some romance in the form of one heck of a love triangle! Emma really did know how to get those boys interested, even though she had never had a boyfriend or anything, and seemed totally incapable of making a decision either.The ending to this was a cliff-hanger, and quite a big one.

Then about half way in stupid shit started happening. These are a few of the things I had a problem with;The love triangle..actually square. It is not ok to tag guys along. girls don't like it so why would a guy? And their brothers no less. Em had no real reason for liking either of them and yet kisses both as well as some chick with a kid... What the f people? If you like two people and cant yet pick between them respect them enough too stay away until u choose! This one factor was like a stab in the eye anytime the same issues cropped up in the book. One minute she hates Will and more or less implies that hes the type of guy that would beat his wife to death just coz she makes him angry...and yet she still loves him but doesnt want to b hurt by him blah blah blah. What kind of freaking message does that send to the young girls who pick up this book? \"Oh he hurt and humiliated me but its ok coz I'm a total sucker for blue eyes and a toned body.\" This also leads me to my next problem with this book;Man hating. Almost every man in this book was seen as a sexual predator. It was like all the dads, brothers and sons in the world turned on women and thought it was ok to just rape and pillage at will from the get go. Em thinks a lot about all the ripping of clothes(done by sex crazed rapists) and ripping of flesh (done by zombies) and how traumatic it is. Yeah it would have been if it was even believable at all. This just pissed me right off. why would a guy waste his time dragging a chick into the forest when the worlds been turned on its head and zombies are mauling ppl left, right and center? It takes the saying \"a man always thinks with his...junk\" to a whole new unbelievable level. I get people screwing each other over to survive I get that not every person in the world is a saint but this book pretty much implied that if something like this ever happened than all my brothers, father, uncles and cuzins, hell even my own son will through all morals and reasonable thought out the window and go on a good old Viking rampage. Yep, hmm somethings wrong here maybe the fact that a man is just as likely to help or stuff u over as a women. What ever happened to equality? Sheesh! My next problem was how seemingly random events, like seirge following and trying to kill emma, was a complete waste of my reading time. He attacks, she kills him, all is said and done no more thoughts on seige or what ever his name was at all. Now tell me what he was in the book again?Then u got the random killing of nurses doctors and guards, yes their the bad guys but are all of them that bad? Or just forced to do the bidding of a cruel over lord?? A nurse and doctor helped Em escape at different points in the novel coz they obviously didn't wanna do what they were being forced to and yet she shoots a heap of them with no probz at all. Doesn't even bat an eye lid. And last but probably not least we have Ems never ending list of injuries that seem to heal in record time and still she traipses around the country side like three days without food couldn't possibly kill her. Totally whack. I had to force myself to finish it coz I just couldn't take all the pointless kissing and man hating. It was like a slap in the face to every male out there. And I wish I had more to say then good start but ya lost me a little less then half way through."}, {"userName": "\u2665 Marlene\u2665 ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1041370-marlene", "userReview": "(Disclaimer. read my p.s 2 before reading my rant.Pissed off cause I have decide a while back not to read a book of a series that is not done. I am very forgetful so when book 3 comes out and it has been a year or more, it means I have to re read book 1 and 2.I checked and on amazon I noticed book 1 and 2 were out and book 3 would be out on July 15. So I thought yes I can safely give this series a try.To discover that coming book is one of those stupid shorties. Another trend of late. The YA adults write a few books which becomes part of a series, but then have to also write a little book, about 60 pages so the publisher and author can earn more.Okay End of Rant!This was what I wrote while readingI'm 53% done with Born: What a surprise. I assume this is not YA? I love it. talking about rape and much more sexual and more mean than I am used to due to most books in this category are written for teens. Of course this book has flaws but I am enjoying it. \u2014 Jul 11, 2013 01:04pmWhat I think are flaws is that yet again there is a love triangle in a book. Why? Why do so many authors feel the need to have a love triangle while people are surviving in a new world? If your world is interesting enough there is no need for that. please.Other flaws: She tells us she managed to survive as a child of 9 for 10 years because she never does something without a care. She always plans and has a lot of patience.Well what happened? We meet her and this girl is anything but patience or careful!! It annoyed me that it was not consistent meaning I think someone can't change in 1 day into a total different person with totally different habits just because she meets 2 people she likes.There are many good things though: Very interesting new world. Interesting character and although she annoys the hell out of me when she communicates (if you can call it that) with Will, she is also smart and brave and sometimes a bit stupid which makes me laugh.I love that this is not for teens and I hope she will sleep with Will in book 2. ;)Not sure what rating to give it.P.S If you know of a good YA or Adult kind of dystopia/utopian book which is not part of a series, I would love to hear.Or any recommendations for series that are finished or just any old good book.P.s 2 (July 29): Just found out that apparently someone made a mistake.

Oh, sweet Jesus have mercy.This book has been recommended on my Kindle quite a bit so I decided why not. I'm actually sad I wasted precious reading money on this. The plot kind of moved fast. First it was surviving by herself; then learning to be with people and think of others; then she risked her life to help them, gets separated and runs into their thought-to-be dead brother. Then she catches feelings for both of the boys despite one being 7 years older than her!!! I give up! Along with the confusing plot, the characters have as much personality as a rock. The only one who actually has a personality is Jake, and that includes being incredibly dumb about survival and basic human knowledge. The main character, Anna , has live alone since she was nine and now at 19 she has no people skills, but at the shame time everyone seems to like her. The first few pages of the book talk about of selfish and how much of a coward she is but, than she pretty much risks her life as much as possible to try to convince us otherwise. And then there is Will. Jakes big brother. I don't even know what to say. They know each other for a few days and then is in love with her but she doesn't want to love him back because she kind of likes his brother but not really. He is sometimes super nice and others a dick for no reason whatsoever. He says she wants to be more than friends with her and then goes and embarrasses her in front of everyone. I don't get it. And near the end she is pretty she she likes him back(why? Idk) but probably forgetting that he is freaking 26! She is 19! That is a big age difference. Don't even get me started on the ending. Or the Romance. Or the sort of loosing her virginity. Or the random strangers she lets into her life on multiple occasions.The idea of the story was actually really cool, but the way the author set up the book taking away the the actual dangers and focusing it on the romance that wasn't there. \"Gunshot, porcupine, and a jackass.\"Yep that pretty much sums it all up."}, {"userName": "Rebecca Partridge", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9455731-rebecca-partridge", "userReview": "Wow!

Having already read and loved Brown\u2019s Seventh Day series, I gave BORN a go and I am absolutely gaga over it. So much so, I went and got the second one and immediately started it. Now I am half way through and figured I better write this review before I get to merging the 2 stories. Since the start of the end 10 yrs ago Emma has been alone. Her rules keep her safe. Her rules have kept her alive. Until someone knocks on her cabin door seeking help. That one simple knock has her rules scattered on the wind and doing things she never would have thought possible just days before. As with the Seventh Day series, BORN was unique in its own way. The infected in the story are like zombies, but not zombies. It\u2019s the ones that are alive, the Others, that you really have to watch out for. All in all I really like Emma. She is highly independent and can fend for herself. But there were times I would have liked to have seen her be a little more less rigid when it came to her new family and friends. She was a little too abrasive at times. But I will say, after being alone for so long I can see how her reactions were warranted. She definitely isn\u2019t your normal book chick. Emma has the whole Katniss thing going for her and can be a total badarse. I am not sure how others feel, as I haven\u2019t read any other reviews, but I adore Will. And it has nothing to do with the fact he shares my husbands name. Ha! No, there is just something about him that had me rootin\u2019 for him throughout the book. He is rough and all his edges are completely raw. But I believe there is more to him than what we are actually seeing. Fantastic read, BORN was a complete hit with me. Already halfway through the 2nd book, and equally hooked, I can't get enough of this series. 5 Stars!"}, {"userName": "Resch Reads", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31647923-resch-reads", "userReview": "So I have been avoiding this book for some time because I have a serious love/hate relationship with Tara Brown. Her writing is phenomenal and she is truly one of my favorite authors; however, she always guts me, shocks me, and breaks me down before giving me an ending. I finally took the plunge and the only negative I found was a love triangle. Not really a fan of the who will she end up with game because knowing there are 3 books and an alternative ending means I am going to need to read them all in a day or two because it will drive me crazy otherwise.In other news, Emma is a bad *ss who lacks social skills but makes up for it in being blunt, honest, and an excellent shot. She is truly one of a kind. You also meet all kinds of characters and people you fall in love with. Emma has a pet wolf named Leo and he guards Emma and helps her survive. There is also the military who collects people for hard labor and the breeding farms. In addition there are the others who are messed up survivors, aka kidnapping or raping. Then finally there are the infected, the people who didn't die off when the end of the current world started. They resemble humans but really they just want to hunt people down and kill them. It was an amazing story!The ending, oh my Lord, I immediately went and bought book 2 because how can you not when the cliff-hanger is that epic. All in all, the book lived up to the hype and I am already half-way through book 2 so I can't wait to find out what happens next!"}, {"userName": "Celestine", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13928747-celestine", "userReview": "Since I enjoy dystopian fiction, this \"YA\" title landed on some to-read lists. Are there elements of this book that are young adult? Yes - especially Emma's naivete and reactions to encountering the first young men of her life. Plus, most of the main characters are in the 15-25 age range and there is an animal sidekick. Emma is 19. However, there are decidedly adult themes, including sexual assaults - in a variety of forms for a variety of characters - that should give pause to some readers/parents believing this is as sexually tame as the Hunger Games trilogy. That said, Tara Brown crafts a good story around a unique heroine. Emma has been alone in survival mode since the age of nine when the world changed. Prompted by her survivalist father, she escaped to the edge of civilization. Very early in the book she encounters 15-year-old Anna and her older brother Jake. Emma feels a kinship with Anna, which is one of the strongest and most interesting relationships developed by Brown. Clearly Em does not understand how to deal with Jake and her emerging attraction. I thought more could have been done with Em's reaction to her re-entry to society. Em's anger about having the two around is shown, but she probably would have been edgier about the company, especially once she arrived at the rebel camp. At one point Jake and Will describe Emma as a female Terminator, and that one word went a long way to describing the lack of surface, visible emotion that we see from Em. Is makes sense, too. She is a deadly shot with her arrow, silent and lethal in the woods, plus ten years of solitude would not encourage emotional displays of any kind. Without the long-term nuances of interactions with other people, she also tends to see things in black and white. For Em, actions speak louder than words.Zombies make an appearance too, but as the plot develops, they are not the scariest population in the story. That honor goes to the racists running the breeder farms. There is a lot of violent action in Born, due mainly to the fragments of society left scrambling for supremecy. Overall, this was an interesting entry into the dystopian trope. If you like a story about a loner turned hero, you might also try Hunter-After the Fall by John Phillip Backus."}, {"userName": "Erika Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12775759-erika-lynn", "userReview": "So as I was browsing through Amazon I came across a different book by Tara Brown and it hit me, \"Why does she sound so familiar?\" So I immediately jump to Goodreads trying to figure it out. I don't remember authors names unless they influence me in some way. In other terms, unless their book(s) are GOOD! I knew, as soon as I saw the cover for this book, that I hit a gold mine. Why oh why have I not read the remaining books in the series? Well, simple, because I wasn't as much of a bookworm back when I read this one. And now, well, I pack in 3 books a week. :PI'm not going to post a full review on this book because I'm planning on adding this review to my blog. I got into dystopian books a little over a year ago. Granted, I'm NOT a sci-fi girl and hadnt this book been a group read- I probably would've passed it up... But oh so glad I didn't! I pretty much fell in some sort of a distorted addiction sorta deal with the main character, Emma. This book is an \"end of the world as we know it\" sort of book. You're probably thinking... Hmmm... Weird. Not at all. Tara Brown sucks you in, keeps you hanging on longing for more, and doesn't disappoint. Now I've just went on an Amazon spree via Tara's books and I can't even wait til I'm done reading my scheduled blog tour books for this month so I can read the rest of this series and then some more of her others! Now, typically, I am a romance book junkie but reasons like THIS book are why myself and my partner have another blog page- made for ALL different types of books and when I finish the rest of the series, I will post my full reviews for all of them.So, it's coming. I swear it. But I never post my reviews before I do it on the blog. So glad I found this hidden gem! Well, it was hidden for me- but that's just because I'm an idiot sometimes and forgot- oh, and I didn't do reviews back when I read this book. Ahhhh yes now I'm excited!"}, {"userName": "Tara", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28341296-tara", "userReview": "I've read the original Born, and the newly re-edited Born (May 14, 2014), and I love the additions and minor changes included. I felt it added a lot to an already great story. Tara Brown does a fantastic job describing this new world, and all the dangers in it. Makes you wonder -- which is worse, humanity or the infected?When I find a book I want to read, there are some things I scan reviews to find out. I\u2019ve outlined what I often like to know up-front in hopes that it can be helpful for you as well.1. This is book 1 in a trilogy (there is Born to Fight and Reborn)2. As with many trilogies, there is a cliffhanger at the end of this book (but the trilogy is complete, so you can finish the series)3. I would classify this as Mature YA, as there are zombie-like creatures and rape is mentioned in several parts throughout the story, though not vividly described. It is slightly toned down in the edited version, but I would still say the reader should be more on the mature side.4. This series is dystopian, not horror, so while there are \"the infected\" (zombies), there's a lot more to the story than that, and more that you learn with each book.Throughout Born, Emma finds newfound strength and courage and turns into a great heroine. This is an amazing dystopian series that has a good blend of sci-fi, fighting, romance, and humor....and it's FREE right now on Amazon (cover is black with blue teardrop)"}, {"userName": "\u2665 Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Apr 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13161862-sarah", "userReview": "This isn\u2019t my first brush with indie-YA/NA dystopia. But it is my first Tara Brown book. I didn\u2019t know quite what to expect, but for $1 on amazon, I figured I\u2019d give it a try. First, the story is told in third person narrative, but focuses primarily on Emma. I don\u2019t want to rehash the summary, but I liked the way the story was told. The survival element was spot-on, and the level of suspense exceeded my expectations. And I was fairly pleased with the \u2018dystopian\u2019 elements, and world building. However, there were obvious issues with editing, grammar, punctuation, etc. And I had MAJOR issues with the \u2018romance\u2019 aspect of the novel. It was just really awkward, weird, too fast-paced, so stupidly clich\u00e9d, and ultimately UNBELIEVABLE. The whole love triangle angle between brothers \u2013 was just distasteful. That\u2019s just one element of a larger string of elements that didn\u2019t work for me... Overall, there were too many things happening at once. The love triangle, the breeding farms, the zombies, the survival aspect, the camps, etc. My favorite character was Leo, the wolf. Then, it was Anna. I need to be able to like, or at least respect the protagonist of the story in order to really give this book a 3+ star rating. And most of the things that happen in the story were just TOO unbelievable. Emma\u2019s declaration of LOVE for both brothers was just sickening; I found myself skimming through chunks of useless descriptions, and A LOT of awkward moments. Basically, I wanted to hurl \u2013 OFTEN \u2013 so that\u2019s never a good sign. Then it ends with a cliffhanger.... I might give the sequel a try, but my expectations are pretty low at this point."}, {"userName": "P.A.

Emma has lived on her own for 10 years with her pet wolf. She's strong and brave and can do everything from hunt for food or stitch a wound up. She hasn't had any human contact in 10 years so when a young girl name Anna and her brother Jake enter her life she's weary of them.

Along the way Emma meets Will, Jake and Anna's older brother who they thought was dead. Emma finds herslef between to guys or two brothers is more like it. This book is wonderful Emma isn't a girl who sits on the side lines and waits for the men to come home. Nope Emma is the first to volunteer to go into a risky situation where she could end up getting hurt or even killed. Emma and Will have a lot in common but Will can't seem to get over the fact that Emma doesn't need him to protect her. Jake is a fun,loving person who want's Emma any way he can have her. My heart broke for Emma and I got so mad when a certain brother keeps hurting her. I love Tara's books. She has a way with words and it feels like your in the story living the character's life.

It was very close to being a five star for me. Very close. I can't fault the writing, it was really great writing that gripped me from the off. The story itself gripped me from the off too; a girl of 19 living on her own for 10 years in a post apocalyptic world\u2013what's not to like. It was great, a girl struggling to come to terms with the world as well as trying to grow up. She was told by her father to run and that is exactly what's she done. No human interaction at all.She then has a girl turn up at her door asking for help and she reluctantly does help. It's against everything she has been told by her father but she does it. From then on, she begins to help and help and begins to meet more people and she actually gets used to it and loves helping people. She also loves the family element.The only reason I didn't give it five stars(and it's just personal opinion) is because of the potential love triangle building. Now I don't mind abit of romance in books but I just felt that this could have done without it. I'm not saying it's a bad thing but perhaps it wouldn't be missed if it wasn't there. But hey ho that's just me. Overall, a fantastic book and I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait to get into the next two books :)"}, {"userName": "Emma B", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6351317-emma-b", "userReview": "I'd give this book either a high 2 or low 3. It had really good bits, but also bits that made me want to scream. Initially, I liked Emma, but her behaviour about Will and Jake irritated me. You can't just randomly state that you love a person after two minutes of knowing them. You can't just randomly state that you hate someone then be all lovey dovey with them four seconds later. Plus, her reactions to things were not sane or reasonable a lot of the time. Also, all the males in this book apart from Leo were despicable human beings. Seriously, I did not like one of them. However, I did like Anna. I also liked the fact that this is a viral infection causes zombiesque population dystopia but it focuses more on the human problems. Nothing wrong with some zombies, don't get me wrong, but its nice to read something a little different. I got this on Kindle for fairly cheap but there were a lot of spelling and grammar mistakes, it should really be edited over again. So overall, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but I'm sure other people who actually like the caliber of love interest in it will enjoy it.
