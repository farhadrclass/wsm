My favourite story in the collection is Tahmima Aman's Garments about Bangladeshi women working in a garment factory - and their strength and dignity despite the poverty of their lives. I used it in the classroom alongside Yiyun Li's story Extra (from A Thousand Years of Good Prayers) because both stories illuminate small lives and show them in the context of the wider society and globalisation."}], "description": "Young garment workers in a Bangladeshi factory seek a better life, at a price... A girl on a deep, dark moor is drawn into a different kind of darkness after a stranger gives her a bunch of flowers... A retired plastic surgeon, who once served the great and the not-so-good of Buenos Aires, finds a new peace when he disguises his identity... An academic seeks sanctuary in a different rhythm of life... While those who wile away the nights in A&E, unlikely memories and a good sense of the absurd keep the worst at bay... The characters assembled in this year\u2019s shortlist are all looking for a new start, a chance to escape or change the way they are perceived. Now in its eleventh year, the BBC National Short Story Award with BookTrust continues to showcase a literary form in the very best of health. The stories this year were shortlisted by poet Kei Miller, Man Booker Award-winning novelist Pat Barker, Southbank Centre\u2019s Literature Programmer Ted Hodgkinson, and BBC\u2019s Books Editor Di Speirs. The judging panel was chaired by Woman\u2019s Hour presenter Jenni Murray, who also introduces the collection.", "title": "BBC National Short Story Award 2016", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32198538-bbc-national-short-story-award-2016", "average": 3.8, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1474806418l/32198538.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/429519.Tahmima_Anam", "name": "Tahmima Anam"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6431820.Claire_Louise_Bennett", "name": "Claire-Louise Bennett"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/58851.Hilary_Mantel", "name": "Hilary Mantel"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/204056.Lavinia_Greenlaw", "name": "Lavinia Greenlaw"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6587235.K_J_Orr", "name": "K.J.
