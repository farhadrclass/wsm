Ma potrebbe: perch\u00e9 ha molto della fiaba.Come spiega bene nella postfazione Gabriella Bemporad, specialista in letteratura tedesca e mitteleuropea, il racconto lungo di Stifter \u00e8 pieno di riferimenti a spunti biografici: il fatto curioso \u00e8 che, per\u00f2, Stifter non and\u00f2 mai cos\u00ec in alto in montagna, non aveva conoscenza diretta dei ghiacciai, ma solo attraverso i racconti e i dipinti dell\u2019amico Friedrich Simony, geografo e geologo e scalatore, come questo qui sotto. Friedrich Simony: Gletscherphaenomene.Scritto nel 1845, usc\u00ec alla fine dell\u2019anno su un giornale, e fu poi ripreso nella raccolta di racconti \u201cPietre colorate\u201d pubblicata nel 1853, sei racconti tutti intitolati con un nome di pietra: Granito, Pietra calcarea, Tormalina, Mica, Argilla lattea, e questo Cristallo di rocca, che \u00e8 sicuramente il migliore del lotto.Lo stesso Stifter, che insegnava fisica e matematica al figlio del principe Metternich, presso il quale abitava, si dilettava in pittura. Eccone un esempio.Adalbert Stifter: Fattoria.Corrado, pi\u00f9 grande, e Sanna, la sorellina, sono andati a trovare la nonna e stanno tornando a casa per il sentiero che conoscono bene, tre ore di cammino da un piccolo paese all\u2019altro dove vivono.\u00c8 la notte di Natale. Il tempo peggiora improvvisamente, la neve ricopre tutto, loro smarriscono la strada, sono costretti a passare la notte in montagna in una grotta simile al palazzo di un re delle Alpi, costruito di smeraldi, zaffiri e cristallo di rocca.Al mattino vengono trovati dai soccorritori, e gli abitanti dei due paesi, che fino ad allora si erano pacificamente ignorati, adesso fraternizzano.Riassunta cos\u00ec \u00e8 un concentrato di edificante melassa ultra zuccherina. Stifter sa condire il racconto con abilit\u00e0: il paesaggio familiare si trasforma in un regno di mistero fatto di neve, pietra e ghiaccio \u2013 altrettanto misteriosa \u00e8 la grotta dove i due bambini trovano riparo, luogo di possibili insidie ma anche di seduzione \u2013 la paura viene tenuta a bada dalla speranza che il nuovo giorno porti alla salvezza.E con grande semplicit\u00e0 e pulizia di forma, sa muoversi tra realismo e simbologia,sa coniugare il mito con la verosimiglianza, la favola con l\u2019oggettivit\u00e0, la terra col cielo.Illustrazione di Ludwig Richter per la prima edizione (1853) della raccolta di novelle \u201cPietre colorate\u201d di Adalbert Stifter, dove compariva anche il racconto \u201cCristallo di rocca\u201d.Le interpretazioni sono fioccate: i moti rivoluzionari del 1848, ai quali Stifter ader\u00ec con entusiasmo, per poi staccarsene quasi subito davanti all\u2019orrore per la violenza popolare \u2013 e quindi l\u2019intento nascosto sarebbe pedagogico e politico insieme volto alla pacificazione. Oppure i bambini salvati sono i nuovi valori portati dall\u2019epoca che cambia, da proteggere rispetto alla violenza, e forse anche all\u2019eccesso di passione.Chi ci vede invece un percorso personale artistico di Stifter che abbandona il romanticismo per sposare il \u2018classico\u2019.Oppure, c\u2019\u00e8 chi interpreta sottolineando che purezza e innocenza testimoniano il punto di vista di chi ha fede in una grande \u201ccreazione\u201d.W. Eugene Smith, The Walk To Paradise Garden, 1946.Per me il godimento maggiore \u00e8 derivato da quelle che Gabriella Bemporad sintetizza cos\u00ec: il giro delle stagioni, l\u2019alternanza delle salite e delle discese, il digradare delle diverse vegetazioni sui fianchi del monte, la convivenza, le une accanto alle altre, delle piccole convenzioni e consuetudini del paesino della valle e delle grandiose, luminose meraviglie delle cime, e, descritti con la stessa esattezza, la stessa voce, lo stesso \u2018tempo\u2019, il moto delle costellazioni e la perfetta \u201ccostellazione dei chiodi\u201d sulle scarpe dell\u2019abile calzolaio, i grandi silenzi delle solitudini ele modeste parole del commercio e della solidariet\u00e0 umani, il pauroso, il meraviglioso e il quotidiano contemplati con gli stessi occhi pacati, la fine che si riallaccia naturalmente al principio chiudendo il difficile cerchio dell\u2019armonia\u2026Immagine dal film TV \u201cCristallo di rocca \u2013 Una storia di Natale\u201d, regia di Maurizio Zaccaro, 1999."}, {"userName": "Geoff", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/126266-geoff", "userReview": "I've read Rock Crystal three times in the past three years before the last three Christmases, and though I'm not a Christian and I'm only religious in the sense that I believe certain things to be sacred, there is within my being an almost overwhelming feeling of nostalgia associated with that time period between the end of November and the New Year, and I solemnize, if nothing else, that feeling and my family and I try to understand and be grateful for what they have tried to provide me with in this life, and so I try to give something in return to my Mom and my Dad and my sister and brother and now my nephews, even if that something is only meals I help to prepare and time spent- and all in all \"time spent\" is the greatest gift one person can give to another person in this brief life. This book is a perfect fairy tale that only hints at the supernatural but is all shot through with what one might call magic- small villages in wintry mountains and great floes of ice and snow shafts in the waning light and aurora borealis and the utterly enchanting vision of falling snow (still, to this day as a sad adult, falling snow is the most enchanting thing) and a children's journey, perhaps doomed, but never in this miracle place (the place of fairy tales, where doom is never permanent, and thus is the abiding nature of fairy tales- they are the one place where our dreams outlast doom)- it is a simple Christmas story tinged with something of H\u00f6lderlin's poetic admiration of mountains. Rejoice in the tininess of this not-grand tale (a snowflake) and the sweet kindness it contains (the long dreamy sigh of winter will find its spring). It's short and can be read in an hour or so, so read it to your children or children you might know."}, {"userName": "David", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3073544-david", "userReview": "Who am I kidding? I'm not going to finish this thing. I'll get more enjoyment by just staring at the cover lovingly, stroking it with the tippy tip-tops of my fingers, and saying aloud, 'Pretty!' in the voice of an idiot manchild. This isn't the case of a book deserving a good cover; this is the case of a cover deserving a good book... and this just ain't it.I should have taken the author's name as sufficient warning. I mean, what the hell does an Adalbert Stifter have to tell me? He sounds like the kind of man who should do surveying for topographical maps or who should teach philology in Vienna while scowling at his students, who watch his old worldy muttonchops -- minute by minute, day by day, fortnight by fortnight -- devour his anemic, skull-like face. That's my impression of an Adalbert Stifter anyway.Should I admit to you that this book is only seventy-five pages long? And that the typeface is relative large? And that the line spacing is generous? And yet I still couldn't bring myself to finish it?I had the best of intentions. I would think to myself:Okay. Now I am really, really, really going to sit down to read  Rock Crystal. Yes! I am very pysched about reading a bunch of scrupulous descriptions of the trees, the valleys, the mountains, the shrubs, the streams, the leaves, and the socioeconomic milieu of two Alpine valley communities circa the first half of the 1800s. Won't that be fun? I'm sooooo going to park my keister and enjoy the living shit out of this {allegedly} serene, moving yuletide story of two Hanselesque and Gretelish siblings who get lost in the woods on the way home from visiting their Grams and Gramps. Yes I am. I really am. I completely am. In two minutes I'm gonna go get that book and read the fuck out of it. I can't wait. It's gonna be, like, a totally transcendent experience. Or something. I am having so much fun thinking about all the fun I'm going to have reading about the father's shoemaking business and why the townspeople prefer his shoes to anyone else's. Even Aldo's. Yes. Any minute now I am going find myself so tempted by this beguiling, charming tale of two lost imps that I'll desperately crave a hasty return to those Bohemian villiages. In fact, I'll never want the story to end. Ever! I mean, look at the cover... It's so icy and pretty. It's reminds me of Marlon Brando's crystalline tract home on Krypton in the first Superman movie. Or an Apple store. Something clean, crisp, cool, refreshing. Like a glass of Perrier with a so-thin-you-can-read-through-it slice of cucumber in it. That's what this book is like. And that's why I can't wait to get back to it. I don't even care if I have those two new DVDs waiting to be watched. They're probably not good anyway, right? They're surely not about a pair of Lederhosen-wearing scamps yodeling their way through the Alps on a heartwarming Christmastime trek. What could be better, really? Books like this lift me up to a higher plateau of consciousness. The penthouse of consciousness, you might say. Ten more minutes, and then holy shit... am I ever going to read the fucking fuckety fuck out of that book! I am very, very, very, very excited. Whoohoo! (I wonder if The Biggest Loser is on...)So -- SPOILER AHEAD -- the kids get lost but, unfortunately, they don't die. (I read the introduction. That's how I know.) Death would have really added something to this novel, I think. Violent death? Even better. This thing was just way too prim, starchy, and antiseptic. I imagined the author wearing a pince-nez and long gloves and using a cigarette holder while he wrote it. It's almost as if a dewy-eyed Hegel (in secret) tried his hand at novel-writing and the manuscript were found long after his death by... I don't know, Susan Sontag or someone who wrote their jacket blurb before they had even bothered to read the damn thing."}, {"userName": "Pantelis", "userReviewDate": "Sep 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/59132978-pantelis", "userReview": "Thanks to my library, this year I was the only Athenian who enjoyed a White Christmas..."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "Beautifully descriptive, simple but wonderful, this short novella tells the story of two children lost in the mountains.

It is Christmas Eve, and they are bundled off early for the return trip, with pockets and knapsack stuffed with gifts, edible and otherwise, for their siblings and parents. An unexpected snowfall disorients them and they become completely lost, following the wrong serpentine road up the mountain. They are unable to find the ridge which connects to the next mountain (near their home village) and, after scrambling blindly among huge rocks and over gigantic ice fields, they spend an exhausting sleepless night huddled under a rocky shelter on the edge of the glacier. Although the reader realizes that this would be a harrowing experience for two youngsters, the hauntingly beautiful description of the natural surroundings inspires a feeling of detachment and calm rather than the expected fear and panic. The surreal and eerie beauty of the environment imparts a sense of awe and wonder. I feel privileged to have experienced, through the senses of the author, a part of the earth which I will never see first-hand - the intense, vast, silent world of ice and sky which is the unchanging reality of the mountaintop."}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237469-miriam", "userReview": "Due to the reissue's cover image and the general taste of the selection of friends who had read this, I got the mistaken expectation that this 1)postmodern and 2)actually about rock crystal in at least a metaphorical way.

It is a book for Christmas. And it is a wonderful book for Christmas. I will read it again and again mostly during the Christmas season.What is it about?It is about love and Christmas. Two kids (a brother and a sister) living in one of the Alpine villages go missing on the Christmas eve. As they return from the village of their grandparents, there occurs a heavy snow and they lose the track. They are lost and after a night they are found by the searching group and brought to their village. This is such a simple premise for a story. But Stifter in writing this story has created a wonderful parable of Christmas. There are many allusions to the Christmas event. For instance, when in the middle of the night the lost kids find a shelter in a cave and they witness a shooting star which brightens up the entire drowsy whiteness with lot of colours. And the next day, we see that small girl explaining to her mother that she saw the Christ child. What sustains everyone alive? The love. The love that the brother has for his sister and the simple faith of the small girl in her brother's words. And in the middle of the night to keep them alive (sleeping would have resulted in death) the gift of the grandmother - coffee extracts for the mother - comes in aid. The searching party is organized everywhere and the whole village is involved in searching out the mountain. The finding of the children brings joy to the entire village. At this moment everyone realises that each one is connected by the thread of love. And that makes life very joyful. And the backdrop is the Christmas day. What else one needs to ask for in this short tale? In fact, the narrations of the natural happenings and the nature are just fantastic. That is an added bonus to me."}, {"userName": "Hadrian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4100763-hadrian", "userReview": "A rather bland fable with stiff characterization and superb landscape descriptions.

Like so many writers, he depended on the approval of others and despaired over the public indifference to his novels. Obviously, his own character was one that could not overcome this perception regarding his own inadequacies. He took this public refusal of his life\u2019s work so personally that his last act on earth was to unfortunately cut his own throat. This is a fiction, but all of us bring something of ourselves to the reading of any text, that is, unless we are dumb to the ways of the heart and our own human impulses. What matters to many of us at specific and certain times, for others matters to none. Within the law, I myself am naturally a hardened, cold-blooded murderer. Like a farmer tending to his flock and crops I do what must be done to extricate and eradicate in order to protect the better interest of all I am charged with safekeeping. It helps a human to be hard when it entails a violence unbecoming of a man so closely attuned to nature. Death is simply a matter-of-fact and nothing one needs to dwell on. But when children are involved this sometimes frozen heart of mine thaws to a degree baffling to the ears of those who know me and who hear me babbling in my pleading cries for mercy. And I, who have never been a lover of young children, even my own, rise to their defense and protection like no other. It puzzles even myself this manner in which my overwhelming and compassionate emotions seem to exflunct my long-hardened stance. My posture severely bends in the doubling over of my agony, and I wish the present experience had never occurred or would quickly end. Much has been praised about this fine little book Rock Crystal. In addition, there have been others who cannot bear the seeming pretense of this labeled prim and human-caring spectacle. I understand this latter position better than my own. But what is important I think to note is how, through our many years, we all do change. Everything looks different from an altered or, it is hoped, an evolved point of view. Our tastes in food, music, and literature are good examples of this, not to mention our specific needs for sex and meaningful relationships. If one lives long enough the important lesson learned is that all of life changes all of the time. It is true that everything is in flux in this world ruled by utter chaos. What seemed to me at first to be a very brief encounter when taking a peek at the total ninety-six page count actually resulted in more than seven days of reading time. My sessions were only good for a very few pages at each seating. So descriptive were the geographies and social sciences that I struggled at times to absorb them all. It was almost too much. Early on I was asking the author for the point of his story. But it did not take me long to realize in fact that Adalbert Stifter was very good at this craft of writing. I committed to continue in my struggle, and to march on through his text to see what I might see. Unlike a few critical others, the name Adalbert Stifter interests me to no small degree. I have wanted for some time now to read his work just because of that remarkable and mysterious name. I believe in the threat of danger involved in just viewing the face of the name\u2019s own landscape on this page that claims the name of Adalbert Stifter.Crazy as it sounds, I suspect in some ways this novella may be misconstrued again as a type of Christian tale because it more than once invoked its name. I think it instead makes a statement relatively more inclusive to all humanity and the brilliantly glorious and fantastical wonders of our world. For me, a literary vehicle coursing through the streaming blood that comes from the violent death of one Adalbert Stifter, a gruesome murder bloodied by his own hand, this tale bravely mounts itself in its own way indifferently onto his fiction. And is as well proof of his own denial of a god\u2019s commandment stating thou shan\u2019t kill. Literally, this book was an amazing effort he made in making me see, and for that world of his I entered and that person I am who in this case allowed himself to be written upon, I am quite grateful."}, {"userName": "booklady", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady", "userReview": "A dear friend gave me Rock Crystal as a Christmas gift this year and I can highly recommend it as a great Christmas read!

When returning home after dark during a heavy snowfall, the children become lost and discover themselves out on a glacier, and unable to get down. As is often the case, the children teach the adults the value of Life and Love.

Stifter is the \"landscape painter\" of German realist novelists, and this little novel begins with a leisurely tour of a mountain range, so that as readers we know our way around. Then two little children get lost in the mountains. It's not meant to be melodramatic: it's the opposite: a potentially maudlin story told with absolute calm and with fastidious and accurate attention to the Alpine landscape. Beautiful and serene.W.H. Auden makes all these points in his intentionally simple introduction. Stifter means to make a Christian parable, but it is not a parable of redemption. It is about harmony: harmony of people with themselves, with each other, with the landscape. People and mountains are largely silent. A person's regard of another shows how much they understand of that other: the boy of his devoted sister, both the boy and the girl of the mountain.The pace and the purpose of the story couldn't be farther from the frenetic & hysterical inventions of our current novelists (thinking of McCarthy, Galchen, Baker, et al.).It is a wonderful tonic.

Two kids, \"the right road lost\" (in Dante's words), wander out onto a glacier in the Austrian Alps on Heilige Nacht (Christmas Eve). Taking refuge in a stone cave or hut, Conrad and Susanna are kept awake - and from freezing to death - by a vial of coffee extract given as a gift by their grandmother, then by a stirring and inexplicable light show over a vast ice field at midnight, which the young girl sees as the coming of the Christ-child. On the night in which Christ, too, was born in a cave (not in a lean-to, with soft natural lighting, as most people believe) the lost children struggling to survive witness the utter beauty of Nature and Spirit.Undiluted magic here. A little slow to start (like a good walk or a long German sentence), but at 76 pages it's a quick, breathtaking read.

In this case, the same things divides and unites. A mountain with \"dazzling horn-shaped peaks\" forms the barrier between two villages.

Still, if you're into idylls and Christmas stories -- how about the Alps or winter? -- you may find this little foray worth the trip.Young Conrad and his younger-still sister Sanna are traveling on Christmas Eve morning from their parents' home to their grandparents' home in another valley. All goes well and Grandma sends them home with a few gifts. On the way home, all does not go well. A snowstorm hits. At first the children are delighted because there is no wind (unusual) and the snow is pretty, but soon the landscape changes appearance and before they know it they are lost. Conrad gamely tries to lead Sanna out of danger but only gets them more lost. They wind up on a glacier.To enjoy the book, you have to slow down your reading at the glacier. It's the essence of the book, really, as Stifter, through translators Elizabeth Mayer and Marianne Moore, engages in some stellar nature descriptions of the glacier, the snow, the mountains, a cave, and the nighttime sky. On a parallel track, he relates what's going on down in the villages where children are receiving their gifts from the Christ child (as opposed to Santa). The contrast is the thing here, because the holy goings-on somewhere below and the holy goings-on up on the glacier are different things entirely. Or are they?If you can draw lessons from this escapade as well as from the search efforts on Christmas Day, you'll be happy you made the trip. It is unlike any Christmas tale you've ever read, no doubt, and Goethe would be proud (as would Thoreau and Emerson, probably). Not so much exciting as quaint and contemplative. Quick and peaceful. If you're in the mood for such, ROCK CRYSTAL is your book."}, {"userName": "Feliks", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5085729-feliks", "userReview": "Superb. I'm struck rapt by intense, finely-wrought, piercing little books such as this. They're rather rare and difficult to discover; they read like a vivid dream; the language is poetic and mesmerizing and all too succinct. That's their stamp.The story here--like the others I'm recalling (Light, for example; or Maxims, The Little Prince, The Velveteen Rabbit, or The Poetics of Space) is extremely simple, but filled with potency, poignancy, and brooding. All the more so considering the author's tormented adult life and eventual suicide.If a book might sweat, or shiver with what it has to tell you--this would be one such narrative. You zip through it, soaking up every paragraph--sometimes going back to marvel at a particularly well-done passage or turn-of-phrase. Its akin to hearing a story around a campfire--all your senses are concentrated and focused on just this one phenomenon. When its over, you come back to the drab normal world with reluctance. You nerve-endings savor the experience for months afterwards. These 'tiny' books --are the ones you grow fondest of--and are the ones which stay on your shelf long after other works have been consigned to cardboard boxes. It's also a fine book to give to someone as a gift."}, {"userName": "Antonomasia", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6249204-antonomasia", "userReview": "[3.5] Set at Christmas, but have you heard this weather?I can see why some people find Rock Crystal sweet, others cloying - I'm midway. A piece somewhere between a short story and a novella, it's very Victorian (actually Austrian, pub.1845, this translation made 100 years later) and the mental gear-shift it required was the same as the first such I remember making when, as a kid, I read one of Andrew Lang's Fairy Books found at my grandmother's. The two children, Conrad and Sanna, are impossibly good, and of course appropriately so for their ages and genders. The chocolate-box village sounds lovely ... no-one's going to mention the less pleasant side of unchanging traditions and close-knit small community. The descriptions of scenery are very well done in their Victorian way, but can't compete with their more striking and vivid counterparts - which I can still feel - from another, more complicated, story of children lost in the snow, Tarjei Vesaas' The Ice Palace.Also, nice to know that 'Holy Night' (as in the carol Silent Night) is an Austrian / German name for the night between Christmas Eve & Christmas Day."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12003127-lisa", "userReview": "Ice--nothing but ice.There were great slabs lying, covered with snow but on the edges glassy green ice showed; there were mounds of what looked like pushed-up foam, the sides dull but with inward glimmers as if crystals and splinters of precious stones had been jumbled together...\nThe gorgeousness of the prose and the completeness of the nearly-alien world it depicts--life in a quiet 19th-century Alpine village--lend this slim book its heft and fascination. The plot concerns two children getting lost in a snow storm, but the plot is hardly the point. Adalbert Stifter lays out the mountain terrain meticulously, piece by shimmering piece, until the vast and frozen mountain traversed by the children becomes nearly animate, a being of singular agency. Stifter invokes an enigmatic, vibrant relationship between the people of the mountain village of Gschaid and the geographical landscape that dominates and directs their lives and, with his luminous translated prose, draws a clear line from separation to wholeness in the universe."}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4024731-jonathan", "userReview": "Oh, this book must be so unfashionable these days. The most unfashionable element is probably the detachment; the prose is clear, unemotional, controlled. In an age where everyone wants to express their emotions to everyone all the time then this sort of prose must seem unbearable. However, I imagine that fans of the equally unfashionable Eichendorff and Sherwood Anderson and possibly the more fashionable Kafka would be interested in giving this book a read.The next unfashionable element is probably the complete lack of cynicism. It is a tale of innocence in what is probably an unrealistically idyllic setting. Innocent maybe, but at no point does it become mawkish. The plot is simple: two children get lost in the snowy mountains returning from a visit to their grandparents' on Xmas eve. The characters are sketched out with a minimum of detail. The plot and characters are relatively unimportant as the prose is exquisite.I particularly liked the way Stifter started the story: he describes how Xmas is celebrated in the area; he then describes the mountain region; he then hones in on the village Gschaid; and then on one of the villagers, the shoemaker; and then begins to describe the shoemaker's family life; he then starts the narrative proper.The blurb on the Pushkin Press copy is a good summary of the book:In a remote valley, among high mountains, sits a village with a church, a schoolhouse, no roads (merely cartways) and little else. On Christmas Eve the village shoemaker's two children set out, travelling across the hills to visit their grandparents, past the mountains with their giant slabs of crystal ice. This small fable builds, with quietly mounting power and an intensely felt sense of nature, into something beautiful: full of innocence and deeply conscious of the fragility of life. It is an enduring Christmas tale that movingly rewards each reading.

Stifter had his time but it has passed. His elaborated descriptions of nature fail to move me, the characters and the plot are deliberately idyllic in line with the conservative introversive values of the Biedermeier, the time between Napoleon's occupation of Germany 1815 and the start of the European revolution in 1848. Nonetheless, reading the novella as an example for Stifter's gentle law (\"Sanftes Gesetz\") had its merits as an alternative draft to today's dominating achievement-oriented society:\"So wie es in der \u00e4u\u00dferen Natur ist, so ist es auch in der inneren, in der des menschlichen Geschlechtes.

Rock Crystal revolves around Conrad and Sanna, two young children who get lost in the mountains on their way home from their grandmother's on Christmas Eve, right in the middle of a terrible snowstorm. Stifter doesn't present this as a gripping melodrama, but more of a simple story of man (though a more innocent pair as opposed to one of experience) vs. nature, and the more loving remembrance of nature having managed to overcome it for now. Stifter is clearly trying to make the story as short as possible, and in 75 short pages you really get to know the customs of Christmas, the customs of the these small mountain villages, the landscape (with beautiful panoramic descriptions), this family, and the peril that the kids go through. It's a marvelous feat and being able to tell so much with so little, and some of the naturalistic descriptions are painfully lovely (and even, in regards to the constant mention of silence and darkness, kind of terrifying). It becomes clear that Stifter is more interested in writing more of a folktale or parable as opposed to a more tense and plot driven narrative (even the dialogue between the children, where Sanna usually simply says \"Yes, Conrad\" or other variations strips these two of any real characteristics), and it makes the novella more successful as it manages to avoid cheap drama.

Stifter saves the story through is appreciation of the combined beauty and danger of nature (as expressed in the snow storm and the mountain pass). The moutain and the storm almost become characters in the story.I was also intrigued by the tension between the Catholicism of the villagers and a sense of the divine being dwarfed by nature and nature itself as the threat against human existence which seems more akin to the sense of nature in early Nordic sagas.I don't want to read too much into the story since is is essentially a simple tale, but I liked it more than I anticipated. My only complaint is that one should wait to read the introduction by Auden until after reading the story since he gives the plot of the story almost immediately and it ruined the sense of discovery I might have otherwise felt about the story."}], "description": "Seemingly the simplest of stories\u2014a passing anecdote of village life\u2014 Rock Crystal opens up into a tale of almost unendurable suspense.
