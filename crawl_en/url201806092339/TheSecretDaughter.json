It's a fiction book....set in Australia.Much of the subject is very real: \"Forced Adoption Practices\". This history will turn your stomach. At one time the government controlled laws about young woman who were pregnant -(born out of wedlock)- Put into maternity homes against their will. Decisions we're made for these young girls \"BABY FOR ADOPTION\". BFA marked their charts. \"Life is unfair, she whispered. But that doesn't mean it has to be cruel\". \"I wanted to be a person who brought history to the next generation, because if we don't learn from 'about' our history, how can we learn from it.\"There is another important topic in this novel. When do you tell your own child they were adopted? Or the person they always thought to be their father wasn't really? When is the appropriate time to ever come forth with the truth? Is there ever a time when it's appropriate for a parent to 'lie'...(keep information away from them), for any reason that concerns their life history?And if you do finally share truth to the 'adult' child...(married themselves), how do you think this information spills over to them both, the couple? Do you think it carries over any scars for when they have children? I have two close people in my life where - as adults --(much like this story), who receivedshocking information about their biological parent. Both reacted different, but each suffered....as well as others around them. Forgiveness? Yes! ....but when trust is in question of a person's character, pertinent witholding of communications, betrayal to several people... It leaves a scar. Anyone who has an interest in social issues and justice - abuse of power...and a personalizednovel, will appreciate and devour this book. People who have read the book - and loved it as much as me- called \"Necessary Lies\",by Diane Chamberlain ... will enjoy this book with the same passion!!!If I 'had' to fault one thing in this novel... It was towards the beginning half. I felt the author...(who mostly wrote a terrific story worth reading), might have leftout the dialogue about comparing food choices: egg white omelette versus pancakes is one example... because the distorted anger around judging what others eat or not-- actually cheapen Megan's character. It wasn't a flattering for a 38 year old ..( something to me just felt off: but it was minor enough). Her courage and love shined through in other ways. My friend Sue, suggested I read this. Thank you, Sue!!I recommend people read her extraordinary review on Goodreads.comThank you to Bookouture publishing, Netgalley, and Kelly rimmer... ( a wonderful new author to read)!!!"}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13060256-elaine", "userReview": "Sabina is 38 years old and pregnant with her first baby when her parents hit her with the bombshell that she is adopted in this extremely emotional and melodramatic story which weaves its way between 1973 and 2012. The story is told from three perspectives, Sabina herself, her birth mother Lilly and her adopted mother Megan, so we get all three angles of this very sad story. We follow Lilly throughout her pregnancy and birth, Sabina in the present and throughout the story and particularly during the second half of the book we find out just what the connection between Lilly and Megan was, and how she came to adopt Sabina.It isn\u2019t hard to imagine Sabina\u2019s reaction to the news; one of anger and confusion, especially as her parents waited so long to break the news to her. Why wasn\u2019t she told sooner? And, why are her parents still not telling her the truth and behaving so cagey about matters. It soon becomes clear that if she is going to find out anything at all about her birth parents, she is going to have to do it without their help.The first half of the book is extremely emotional as we watch Sabina trying to come to terms with the news and her feelings towards her parents. However, the second half of the book is more upbeat and much more positive all round and I was quite relieved about this as I felt I was almost wallowing in angst. If you like a good melodramatic read where you can crack open a bottle of wine, a box of chocolates and the tissues, then you will really like this one. Many thanks to the publishers for the review copy."}, {"userName": "sue", "userReviewDate": "May 27, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7377874-sue", "userReview": "I was eager to read this book as I have heard a lot about it so, when I was granted a copy from Bookouture via Net Galley in exchange for my honest review, of course, I jumped right in.Kelly Rimmer the author doesn't mess about, she tells it like it is, and draws you without you noticing it. I sat and finished this book today, I had only started it late last night, but I just had to pick it up and carry on. I did text my book buddy to say 'you gotta read this', she looked, and she has it to read on her list. I am so glad of that because I just know she will love it.What must it be like to be in your 30's. Married. Expecting a child of your own and then being told by your parents that you had been adopted. This is what happened to Sabina.Can you imagine the impact?Ted her husband is stood right beside her, he has her back, he has her emotions, he is a great help to her, solid and factual. But Sabina cannot come to terms with this, OF COURSE NOT, its a SHOCK to the must amazing degree. Her life [as she knew it] was now in pieces.Its not easy to think \"well, these are still my parents, they brought me up\", its the big heap of questions that go around in your head and one of the big ones is: Who is my Mother?She finds her parents very cagey.Now this is where it got so addictive for me I was solidly glued to my Kindle. Just what were the parents hiding?Just what more shocks were in store for Sabrina.Then I had a sudden thought......she is pregnant herself, what if the shock makes her loose her unborn child?I did take note of when Ted was pointing out things about her family. I related to that as my husbands Father was controlling but my husband couldn't see this until many years later into our married life. I felt for Ted as its hard to point out something you see without causes offence but its for a persons own good. There is an awful lot packed in this book.I love how there are chapters that appertain to the biological Mother writing to her lover. How the book goes back, you can FEEL that poor girls anguish. I felt quite choked up at times. Sabina's emotions came out from the pages and completely smacked me between the eyes, I felt it, it was real. As I got more into the book, I really wondered how parents could do this to someone. Keep this huge secret and not tell, how can someone do this, its messing with someone else's choices. THEN I got more information and it sort of altered the way I was thinking.ABSOLUTELY A 5 STAR I would definitely give this more if I could.*Heart renderingly real.*"}, {"userName": "Tracy Fenton", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18478389-tracy-fenton", "userReview": "A very beautiful and sensitive story based on truly heartbreaking true events in Australia in the early 70's concerning forced adoptions.

At 37 years of age, she falls pregnant, only to find out she was adopted.What a shock that would be to anyone.It's also a shock to Sabina as she already loves her unborn child more than she would have imagined possible.How could anyone abandon their child? Why was she put up for adoption?Sabina struggles with these questions and then sets out to find her biological mother.At this point in The Secret Daughter, I was almost frightened for Sabina.Sure, she has a right to know, but that knowledge could easily be a horrible tale?To say more would spoil this book for prospective readers, but what I will say is I thought The Secret Daughter was written with such sensitivity and skill you almost feel touched by Sabina personally.It's a beautifully constructed story that I can honestly recommend."}, {"userName": "MetLineReader", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5585442-metlinereader", "userReview": "Wow what a corker.

Kelly's first novel with Bookouture, Me Without You, was published back in June 2014, and is one that I haven't yet had the chance to read, but I'm certain that after my experience with The Secret Daughter, I will definitely be treating myself! There is no doubt in my mind that Me Without You will be absolutely saturated with the same effortlessly real emotion that Kelly's second novel is.In The Secret Daughter, Kelly Rimmer masterfully handles a truly tender and moving plot that had the floodgates bursting open. One of the things that I adored most within this book was how it was structured. Rather than taking the reader right the way through Sabina's story of self-discovery in the present day, the reader is swept into the past during a time of great sadness and grief. Not only do we watch this emotional novel unfold from Sabina's first-person narrative, which was completely overwhelming, but we're also invited to watch the past reveal itself first through Lily's letters, and then through Megan's first person perspective, too. I've probably made it sound complicated in my review but I can assure you that this is most definitely not the case. Kelly handles these different times and narratives with excellent ease, and I cannot applaud the author enough on the effect that this had on me as a reader. I believe that when an author takes a reader into the past, something magical happens. Not only are we involved in the story and the characters, but in this novel, we're finding things out before the characters themselves, life-changing things that I sort of felt a bit awful for knowing before the person who these things affected most. This graceful slipping between the past and the present left me breathless, with sadness and disbelief and utter, utter despair, because I knew that past events, no matter how awful, just couldn't be altered. I believe Kelly chose the most effective way to tell this story, the most impassioned, stirring way.What unfolds in this novel is something that I've never experienced first-hand in my own life, but Kelly deals with the situations which arise beautifully. It's a very serious, very delicate subject, and even more so because the main character Sabina has absolutely no idea what it is that's about to unfold when she and husband Ted announce their pregnancy to her parents. It was a shock for me, as the reader, to watch Sabina's life suddenly be tugged from beneath her when just moments ago it had seemed so neat and orderly. Kelly's descriptions of Sabina's emotions captured the sheer distraught and confusion perfectly. Despite having never been in such a situation myself, I did feel as if I were experiencing Sabina's emotions right alongside her. It was a captivating read, filled with a very raw and devastating account of a time gone by, and the consequences from past actions. As I mentioned above, this isn't the type of book that I'd usually go for, but I am so very happy that I did. This tugged my heart in so many directions I'm surprised it didn't tear completely apart in my chest. This novel was over-flowing with realness and selfishness that arises only from love. Kelly really does know how to drag her reader into the story and ensure that they stay there. I couldn't have been more involved if I'd tried. I was desperate to see where the discovery of Sabina's circumstances would take her. Whilst reading in the present day, I was eager to get back to the past to see what happened next and whether it would affect Sabina in the here and now. It did, of course, because every action has a consequence, and these consequences echoed through time, so many years down the line.I adored this novel. Absolutely, 100% adored it. Kelly Rimmer is a beautiful writer and I will definitely be visiting her books again sometime in the near future. The Secret Daughter packed such an emotional, powerful punch, one that I don't think I've felt before that I'll always associate with her novels from now on.Becca's Books is awarding The Secret Daughter by Kelly Rimmer with five of my cupcakes! I believe this stunning story will curl around the hearts of many, and squeeze ever so tightly."}, {"userName": "Maggie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36761204-maggie", "userReview": "I received this from Netgallery in exchange for an honest review. I requested this book because I\u2019m adopted. I grew up knowing that fact the same way I knew I was left handed & loved the water. The idea of someone finding that out at thirty nine when pregnant was shocking. I was interested to see how the author would handle this.The Secret Daughter is one of my \u2018stand-out\u2019 books of the year so far. I had read about the atrocities surrounding illegitimacy and adoption in Ireland but I was shocked to read about the way young pregnant girls were treated in Australia in the early seventies.It would have been easy to take sides and condemn the adoptive parents outright. What they did was awful; no one should have that shock thrust upon them. However the way the story is told, from the three women involved does make you realise that nothing is totally black and white \u2013 I still dislike Grahame intensely though! I think this book would appeal to many people who like family stories with a bit of a puzzle thrown in. I have no hesitation in giving it five stars. It really is a lovely book."}, {"userName": "Kim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2252657-kim", "userReview": "This book really makes an impact.

As she was taken from me I knew I might never see my daughter again.\u201dWith forced adoption so much in the news, I was keen to read The Secret Daughter by Kelly Rimmer. Kelly\u2019s first book was a good read; her second novel is not only a good read, it is a thoughtful, touching, careful retelling of one story of adoption. Kelly advises us that it is a work of fiction, but also that it is based in fact.It is 2012 and Sabrina can\u2019t wait to tell her parents she is having a baby. She is expecting them to be overjoyed, but their reaction nearly breaks her heart. She tries to get her mother, Megan, to talk about her experiences with pregnancy and birth but instead is met with an angry declaration \u201cYou were adopted\u201d.Sabrina is 37 years old and this is the first inkling she has of being adopted. She asks the natural questions, \u201cWhy?\u201d \u201cWho are my parents?\u201d, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you tell me before this\u201d. But the answers are not forthcoming; there is more to this story than the three words; secrets hide other secrets.We then read the stories of Sabrina\u2019s birth mother Lily and her desperate attempts to marry the father, James, and keep the baby. As it becoming clear the more we learn about forced adoption, the mothers had little say. In Lily\u2019s case, she was a legal minor, 16 years old, and her unborn child was signed away by her father. Neither she, James, nor his parents could change the permission granted by that signature.Megan knows the pain of getting pregnant, on more than one occasion, without delivering a living child. When she discovers that the inability to carry a child lies firmly with her, she immediately offers her husband a divorce. Although they discuss adoption, Megan feels she wants a child of her own and believes that eventually, this will happen \u2013 they will have the family they crave.Rimmer shows considerable skill in writing in the voices of the three women Sabrina, Lily and Megan. Sometimes I feel Sabrina is too hard on the people who raised her, she finds no area of grey in their decisions. This was after all the 1970s and people thought very differently in those days about the baby born \u201cout of wedlock\u201d.Nonetheless the stories Lily tells, of the hospital where she spent her pregnancy, are heart breaking; 1970s or not, thinking you were doing \u201cthe right thing\u201d by the mother and baby does not excuse the way these girls were treated.Finally given her own voice, Megan becomes a more sympathetic character than you might expect.This novel made me angry, happy and sad; it takes a good book to get me arguing with its characters. I even found myself talking about adoption, both forced and willing, and using examples from this book to support the discussion.I enjoyed Me Without You, Kelly\u2019s first novel and the growth she shows as an author in her second The Secret Daughter is amazing. She exhibits more maturity and the ability to met the challenge of a difficult story with heart and feeling. I sincerely look forward to following her future literary career. Highly recommended.

It is almost as though you are reading a memoir rather than a novel. Kelly Rimmer describes Sabina's pain and confusion so well that you can completely understand how she must be feeling when she discovers, as an adult, she is adopted. Her anger and disappointment at her parents for keeping this secret from her is all too evident, particularly as she has recently discovered that she is pregnant. Like most women, she can't understand how a mother could bear to give up her child. And when she suspects that her adoptive mother knows more than she is saying about her birth mother, her fury increases. She is determined to try to track her birth mother down but it is not easy. It was sad to see how her relationship with her adoptive parents changed.It was Lilly's letters that I found the most poignant though as she desperately tries to contact James so he can come and rescue her from the maternity home. Through these letters, the reader learns more about the forced adoptions which went on in Australia. I knew about this happening in Ireland, as it has been well documented, but didn't know about Australia. Lilly's strong love for her unborn child and bewilderment as she waits for James was heartrending to read about.It was an interesting and unexpected part of the story when we begin to hear the story from Sabina's adoptive mother Megan's point of view. I had very mixed and changing emotions reading these chapters as I read about what Megan had done and to what extent she had been influenced by her husband. This book raised a lot of issues surrounding adoption and how it affects all involved: birth parents, adoptive parents and the adopted child. It made me think about all the circumstances surrounding adoptions in years gone by and why things happened they way they did. Above allthough, the book is about how strong the love and bond between a parent and child can be. I thought this was a really compelling read and would definitely recommend it.(I received a copy to review from Netgalley.

She\u2019s adopted. Nothing in her experiences could prepare her for those words. Setting off on a journey to reconcile her past with the truth, she cannot imagine what lies ahead.This was a book that was fine. Fine characters and story. I was hoping for a step above fine given the subject matter. However everything happened quickly and lose ends were tied up in record speed. A subject like forced adoption, to me, should be messier and more emotional. There was one scene towards the end that did make me tear up, and I wish the whole book was like that. My one other issue was unnecessary description (I blame you Lord of the Rings with your six pages describing a tree). I don\u2019t need to know how someone unwrapped and hung up their scarf. Too much description to me seems like the author just wants to up their word count. Yes, description is needed but not about banal items like taking a coat off.

If you are looking for a nice book where everything is neat and tidy by the end, then this is your read."}, {"userName": "Lisa", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5034284-lisa", "userReview": "What a heartfelt story, where there is heartbreak and happiness.

It was based on true events in Australia in the early 70's concerning forced adoptions. Young expectant mothers were sent to maternity homes and forced to give up their babies. The poor souls had no choice because they had no means of support and their families, for the most part, had turned their backs on them.2012, Sabina, a 38 year old married woman has just discovered that they are expecting their first child. Sabina and her husband have spent many years working and paying off their house and getting themselves financially secure and now they want to start a family. When they call in her parents to give them the news, they are completely stymied by their attitude and especially by her mother's reaction to the news who starts to voice unrealistic concerns and worries about the pregnancy. Sabina becomes very worried about her pregnancy and decided to have some blood tests to see if everything is as it should be.The following day, after the episode with her parents, she receives a visit from them and they blurt out the very unexpected and surprising news that Sabina had been adopted. They refused to give her any other information, just that she was adopted.

This is told from two points of view. In the 1970s Australia had a forced adoption program that made unwed mothers go to a maternity home until their baby was born at which time the baby wasTaken away without allowing the mother to see it. It was then placed with an adoptive family and if none were available the baby was sent into foster care. This was a terrible tragic law that of course was later repealed ( as recent as the 21st century I believe). Hard to believe all this was taking place only one generation ago. The story focuses on a 16 year old who in 1973 was forced to give up her baby and that adopted child was never told until she was nearly 40 years old. A riveting tale of all the emotions by all parties: the young mother who never met her baby, the baby who didn't find out until 40 years later, and the parents who adopted the newborn in 1973.

It just called out to me, and when I read the blurb, I knew I had to read it.38 year old Sabina is all excited. She has just found out that she is going to become a mother. And she can\u2019t wait to tell her parents, she is sure that they would be just as excited as her. Her parent\u2019s reaction to her pregnancy was one that she had never expected. Shocked at her mother\u2019s reaction, she prodded, until told that she is adopted. It had taken them 38 years to admit this truth. Shocked and blindsided by the revelations, Sabina is completely confused. The only thing she knows is that she want to know more of her birth mother. What made her give her baby up? And why was her parents(adoptive) being so cagey. What were they hiding?Sabina goes on a journey, finding out more about herself and her parents than she had ever imagined. A beautifully handled story, it had me in tears, had me hoping, had me crying, and had me desolate when I read about Sabina\u2019s birth mother, Lilly\u2019s story. Lilly\u2019s and Sabina\u2019s story progress in parallel, with us the readers gaining an insight into what actually happened all those years ago which resulted in Sabina getting adopted. The mystery of why Sabina\u2019s parents never divulged the fact that she had been adopted bubbles along until close to the end.The book touched upon the horrors that young unmarried pregnant girls went through in those days where it was all frowned upon. The treatment meted out to them, by the society, and even worse, by their own parents, was heart-breaking to read, to say the least. To think that while this was a fictional account, this could well have been a true account for so many helpless young girls. I can\u2019t even begin to imagine..The narrative had me from the start. I loved the way it started, had me hooked from the start and as the story progresses, it just got better. The characters felt real, and identifiable. Sabina\u2019s reaction to the bombshell(s) dropped on her feel real. I could feel her pain, her utter confusion at the revelation that changed everything that she knew about herself. To be honest, I can\u2019t even imagine how it must feel, to find out, out of the blue, that the two people you have known as parents, the people with whom you share that unbreakable bond, are actually not your birth parents. In Sabina\u2019s situation, it is even more tough, given that she is pregnant herself, and so far, had been extremely close to her parents. The author has done a brilliant job in bringing out all the emotions that Sabina, Lily and her mum go through. It\u2019s heart-breaking and heartening at the same time. A book I would definitely recommend.A 4/5 read. A book that I thoroughly enjoyed, and one that I\u2019m sure a lot of my friends would enjoy reading. This was my first Kelly Rimmer read, but having read this one, I\u2019m sure she goes on to my \u2018favourites\u2019 list.Many thanks to Netgalley and the publishers, Bookouture for the review copy of this book."}, {"userName": "Simona", "userReviewDate": "Jun 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23519770-simona", "userReview": "*Book provided by the publisher on NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*I got to know Kelly\u2019s writing last year when I read her novel Me Without You. I fell in love with it immediately and that\u2019s why I was really excited about this book.The story follows 38 years old Sabina and her husband Ted. They just learned that they are going to be parents. Something weird happens though, when they tell her parents. Sabina\u2019s mum Megan tells her about her miscarriages and then boom the explosion, Sabina is adopted.Of course Sabina is hurt and angry, especially since she\u2019s going to be a mother herself.Sabina is determined to find her birth mother, but it\u2019s not as easy as she thought and her parents are not helping with their lies.The path of discovering the truth is hard and full of surprises, hurt and it changes everything.Sabina eventually meets her new family and discovers the truth. It puts her mother\u2019s past in a bad light. I don\u2019t wanna say more at this point, because it would reveal too much. It\u2019s an emotional, poignant and touching roller-coaster ride for Sabina, her birth mum Lilly and also Megan. I felt really close to Sabina through the writing and just wanted to be there for her. I loved the scenes between her and Lilly, two women, mother and daughter getting to know each other. They are so alike and it\u2019s great that they discover these things step by step. It\u2019s very emotional and hard for both of them. Lilly dealing with this loss, this separation, with the forced adoption and finally being able to be with her daughter, after she had to let go of the hope of raising her.Lilly got pregnant when she was sixteen and was sent to a place where she had to work, then gave birth and never saw her baby again. Here is where Sabina\u2019s mum Megan comes into the pictures, making this story that is hard and sad even more dramatic and traumatic.I never really heard of forced adoption and this book is the perfect way to learn more about it. Kelly describes it with this story and has a very delicate and gentle way to deal with it, that was pretty impressive. She gave us insight, of how women dealing with this felt and built a heart breaking, touching, beautiful, sweet and emotional story around it.Ted was a great support in this story, the perfect loving and sweet husband, I fell in love with him, I have to say, so welcome to my book boyfriend list Ted ;)This whole story is told from three perspectives, Sabina of course, alternating with Lilly first. Sabina is talking about the present/her present and then we have Lilly when she was pregnant with Sabina, then after the birth it changes to Megan and we slowly learn of what really happened with Sabina after her birth.This is definitely one of the most EMOTIONAL books I\u2019ve ever read! I\u2019d advise having some tissues close and maybe even some chocolate. The writing is more than beautiful and the storyline has so much flow and spark.MOVING AND EXCEPTIONALLY FABULOUS!!!"}, {"userName": "Karen Laird", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9075793-karen-laird", "userReview": "I knew when I accepted the offer to read this book that this would be a read that would require a box of tissue close at hand. I also knew that it would be one that I would identify closely with, as I have personally been in the lives of ladies who have had their babies taken at birth, as well as ladies who were adopted at birth and spent years wondering who their mother was. Yes, I knew the tentacles of emotion would run deep when I opened the first page and started the story.But, I was totally unprepared for the shock blast of the emotional upheaval that I immediately was sucked into with the opening salvo as a joyous event of the announcement of a pregnancy by a young couple to her parents turned into an evening of parental breakdown and disjointed revelations that left Sabina, the young mother-to-be, rushing to the doctor for tests and answers. A second visit and confrontation with the parents a day or two later resulted in an even bigger revelation and a true life shattering announcement that she was not theirs. The story was a slow peeling of the layers of Sabina\u2019s life and at the same time a flash-back to the time of the pregnancy of Sabina\u2019s mother, Lilly, and her experience with the Maternity Home System in Australia. It is also the telling of the same story through the eyes of Sabina\u2019s adoptive mother, Megan, who worked in the system.While a well written story, in its own right, Kelly did a masterful job of providing a snapshot of the devastation that the Maternity Home System had on the lives of so many people, just in the telling of the story of how it affected the lives of these three families and the effects that dominated their lives for forty years because of the policies and conditions of the home.Kelly took the time to not only tell a story that would showcase a cause, but she took the time to develop the characters within her story and breath life into them. You could feel the emotion of the mothers and, on several occasions, I had to set down the book to breath before picking it up to move one again. I was so caught up in the emotion of motherhood, of unborn children, of bonding, of the idea of losing a child at birth \u2013 never to see him/her again.The supporting characters were there and played their parts well, but the central characters were almost three-dimensional on the page. You could feel yourself sitting down to tea with them or wanting to reach out and wrap your arms in comfort around them when there was little else you could do. I strongly recommend the reading of this book. It is not an easy read, but it is one that is well worth the effort and time. I would give it a good FOUR STARS as a literary review, but a full FIVE STARS for the moving story effectiveness of content. I loved it.Thank you for taking on such a hard story, Kelly. It was deeply appreciated by this reviewer."}, {"userName": "Simone", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7520534-simone", "userReview": "Growing up as an only child Sabina had a wonderful childhood and is still very close to her parents at the age of 38. Happily married for several years, she and her husband are delighted when Sabina falls pregnant. Assuming that her parents will be just as excited Sabina is floored when they are less than thrilled. Even more strangely her mother withdraws completely, refusing to talk about Sabina's pregnancy at all. After a few days of emotional turmoil the truth is finally revealed, Sabina is adopted.This bombshell has a massive impact on Sabina causing her to question every aspect her life and feel immense anger towards her adoptive parents. Unable to fathom why they hadn't told her, she is even more frustrated when they shut down completely, refusing to share any of the details of her birth or information about her biological mother. Unwilling to be held to ransom by their silence Sabina sets about finding her birth mother, embarking on an emotional, heart rending journey.The Secret Daughter is told in a shared POV between Sabina and her birth mother Lily (with Lily's story being set almost 40 years before). This was an effective way to narrate the novel - while it was obvious that Lily was the birth mother, the suspenseful element was around Sabina's adoptive parents and just what they were hiding. The changing POV let both threads be explored until they eventually met in the middle.This book explores not only the topic of adoption but of the culture of forced adoption and the unmarried mothers homes of the 1960s and 1970s. The attention to detail of this shameful practice was very good and the obvious research gave an authentic feel to the storyline.Although The Secret Daughter explores a heartbreaking and emotional topic it is written in an easy to read style that immediately draws you in and keeps you engaged. I felt that at the characters were all very well drawn and three dimensional and that their emotional reactions to what was happening were spot on. Anybody who has experienced infertility, was adopted or was forced into giving up a child for adoption will no doubt relate to what this novel explores. Perhaps the only small thing I did notice was an overuse of elipses throughout ... It was a little distracting at times. I also felt the second half of the book was perhaps a little bit drawn out. I can't mention specifics without giving away the plot but I thought it probably could have been condensed a little with no loss of impact on the storyline.All in all The Secret Daughter is a compelling and though provoking novel that examines a shameful practice that was widespread in the not so distant past. It also shows the age old truth that the bond between mother and child is sacrosanct and should always be respected no matter what the circumstances."}, {"userName": "Celeste N\u00ed raois", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8260780-celeste-n-raois", "userReview": "Thanks to Bookouture and Netgalley I received a copy of this in exchange for an honest review....Meet Sabina, a 38 year old teacher who is happily married to Ted when she discovers that she is pregnant and is over the moon, Sabina and Ted can't wait to tell their parents but this is where the news is not received very well by Sabina's parents. At first, Sabina is confused and assumes that her mother, Megan is just not happy with the news and is worried for her as she has had many failed pregnancies and would not wish the same for her own flesh and blood. As Sabina presses Megan for answers about her own pregnancy it is then revealed that Sabina was adopted when she was born from a maternity home in a rural town several hours from Sydney. Sabina's carefully constructed world comes crashing down instantly and everything she believed to be true is about to be questioned. As Sabina presses her mother and father for answers it causes a rift between everyone and Sabina decides to take the step on how to go about searching for her birth mother but it\u2019s not as easy as she thought and her parents are not helping with their lies. Will the adoption agency have the information that Sabina needs? Will she find her birth mother? Will she discover that she has another family waiting for her?This was a very bittersweet, emotional, sensitive and heart-warming read, the story flows well throughout the book. It is based on true events surrounding forced adoption in Australia in the 70's. I really enjoyed Kelly's book, it kept me turning the pages until the very end. This story had it all a little bit of humor, love, family, loss, protectiveness to more sensitive and hard-hitting issues - I found I had a little tear in my eye at the end along with shedding a few along the way, so grab this book, curl up on the couch and prepare to have a few lump in your throat moments too. It definitely didn't disappoint. This is Kelly's second novel, her first been Me Without You which was published back in June 2014, and is one that I haven't yet had the chance to read, but I'm certain that after my experience with The Secret Daughter, I will definitely have to get around to reading it and I'm really looking forward to reading more from Kelly.The Secret Daughter is available on kindle and is currently only \u00a31.99 at the time of the publication of this review."}, {"userName": "Loretta Milan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23780051-loretta-milan", "userReview": "One of the biggest considerations when telling a child they\u2019re adopted is often timing. There may not be a right or wrong time but, one thing is certain, the child will have to know at some point. So, what\u2019s surprising about Sabina\u2019s discovery, in The Secret Daughter, is that it happens when she\u2019s 38, well past all they key times she\u2019d need access to her birth certificate such as for her passport to travel to Europe and a license to drive her car.Had she not been terrified she would repeatedly miscarry like her \u2018mother\u2019, Megan, she would probably never have become suspicious of her heritage. But when answers aren\u2019t forthcoming, particularly those related to her questionable birth certificate, tensions rise and her adoptive parents show a controlling side she\u2019d previously passed off as their desire for her wellbeing.However, Sabina persists and what unfolds is a harrowing tale of the past juxtaposed with an uplifting story of rediscovery in the present. It\u2019s told from the points of view of Sabina, Megan and Lilly, her birth mother, giving each segment the most enlightening perspective. All were raw and honest. From hope to devastation, the emotion feels real. Dialogue is natural. Description is simple so as not to distract from the intensity of the story. The whole thing, sadly in Lilly\u2019s case, rings with truth. Very memoiresque.The Secret Daughter is nicely paced with suspense right from the opening chapter. As I read the first few pages, I feared the story was going to be overly sentimental, with Sabina\u2019s pregnancy announced through the \u2018world\u2019s greatest granddad\u2019 mug she gives her \u2018father\u2019. But I was soon reassured this would not be the case. Megan\u2019s seemingly inappropriate reaction to the news cuts through the cheese, raising intriguing questions, stirring anger. It\u2019s her actions that make this story unique. However, she\u2019s not the only one who\u2019s tormented by her decisions. All are haunted with regret, hate or sadness...

It\u2019s certainly not a \u2018romance and flowers\u2019 type of book, but put me in mind of a Susan Lewis type of book. The focus is on Sabina a woman who is pregnant with her first child. What should have been an exciting meet up with her parents descended into news that would rock her whole world? We see Sabina take a very emotional and bittersweet journey to find the truth about her past. She is determined to track down her birth mother but her discovery about her birth literally just skims the surface.The reader takes a journey back to the days when in Australia in the seventies, women didn\u2019t have the support and strength that they do now. I liked Sabina and this really is an emotional read, however it\u2019s written incredibly well and once past the first few chapters I was loathed to put the book down. I will most certainly be looking out for future reads by this author.
