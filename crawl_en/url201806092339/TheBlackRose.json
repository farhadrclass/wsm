When I was young, there were two choices for young girls in historical fiction: books written in the 1950's and bodice rippers. When I was in high school I picked the former. After I graduated, well let's just say I graduated.I read every book by Thomas Costain that I could get my hands on. Some of them were....meh. This one I loved. I read it over and over again. And I cried every time I came to the part where Maryam is crying out: \"Walter. London. Walter. London.\" It seemed so impossibly romantic to me. I recently reread it. It's very dated. The style is...very 1950's. You know what I mean--anachronisms everywhere you turn. That's kind of why I love movies from the 1950's. Those page boy haircuts, Peter Pan collars, and Dior inspired skirts on every female--regardless of the era they're really supposed to portray. And the cone bras--don't get me started! Anyway, this book is very dated. And yet....and yet...\"Walter. London. Walter. London\"It gets me every time."}, {"userName": "Mariam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4664908-mariam", "userReview": "Take a deep dive into the heart of centuries old Great Britain, where your name and lineage are a matter of the deepest importance and there is no middle faction between the wealthy and the poor. The main character of this story travels from the old world of Great Britain, where he is mocked and labeled a bastard son of a wealthy and titled Lord, to the magical and mystical far east, where he is able to earn his worth as a man and experience the strange and unfamiliar ways of lands not even mapped out yet. I read this story when I was 14 years old and have never forgotten what a fabulous tale it is. Not only is it incredibly well written but it has the magical power of a great book, which is the power to stay in the readers imagination forever. I personally believe this is Thomas B. Constain's greatest novel ever written and I would whole heartedly reccomend this book to anyone who loves a good adventure story."}, {"userName": "MrsEdwardCullen", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1105379-mrsedwardcullen", "userReview": "Please don't tell me that you've seen the movie and because it sucked, you're not going to read the book. The book is WAY better than the movie. Superlatives all around, please. Set in 1272, it tells the story of Walter of Gurnie and his trip to the Orient. Romance, action, comedy--but best of all, the writing is top notch. A timeless classic."}, {"userName": "Jon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1080602-jon", "userReview": "Thomas Costain takes the reader on a 13th century journey from England to China. The book's main character, Walter inherits a large sum of money in London and sets off to China inspired by Francis Bacon. Costain expertly depicts the area between Europe and China, especially the Bedouin tribes. In addition to the journey, Walter loves two women, one a noble and beautiful English woman and the other, a beautiful and beguiling woman Walter meets on his journey.Unfortunately, it seems that Thomas Costain books are almost out of print. These books provide a good historical foundation for young students. It does not hurt that this author can spin a good tale too."}, {"userName": "Pat Murphy", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43631531-pat-murphy", "userReview": "This is a great story. It is another one of those \"old\" books I read from time to time. It was written by thomas Costain in about 1945. The tale takes place in England and roams all the way to Cathay which is China or Mongolia or thereabout. The time in history is post Crusades. It has a great love story, chivalry and honor, wealth and poverty, different cultures, and a point of view which describes our Western culture as far as who we think is a superior race. I read some reviews before I started this book and more than one said they enjoyed it as a boy but weren't so sure as an adult. I will say I am 61 years old and I never got bored or tired of it. It was a wonderful story. Hollywood even made a movie of it in about 1950."}, {"userName": "Rebecca", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/124771-rebecca", "userReview": "I've read this book multiple times. It's a refreshing novel, published in 1945, and written by the author of \"In His Steps\" (What would Jesus do? originates here, for the uninitiated - another great novel). Costain portrays this remarkable period of the Dark Ages by framing his plot with three great men - Edward the First of England, the father of parliamentary rule; Bayan of the Hundred Eyes, the brilliant general of Kublai Khan who conquered the whole of China in a series of daring and aggressive compaigns; and Roger Bacon, who has often been portrayed as one of the greatest scientists the world has ever seen.  The Black Rose  originates in a romantic English legend concerning the father of Thomas a Becket and an Eastern girl. However, the story itself smacks of adventure, some masculine romance (more action, less talk - think Louis L'amour), and overtones of cultural awareness and understanding. A very engaging story, in the simplistic tone of the pre-nuclear Americas."}, {"userName": "Toni", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5239326-toni", "userReview": "I really liked this book. I liked the characters and the story. So why am I giving it only 3 stars? It lacked specialness, vital spark, anything that touched me in a way all readers hoped to be touched when they read. I felt no passion for the characters even though I liked them and they were well drawn. I never once sat at the edge of my seat biting my nails wondering what might happen next. I never sat up late at night reading because I just could not put the book down. I never loathed a character, nor did I adore one. I merely liked or disliked them. I never felt angry or laughed or cried. Basically I was never really MOVED in any way because I didn't connect with the characters. While The Black Rose was a very enjoyable read, well researched, and well written for the aforementioned reasons I cannot give it more than 3-3.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Amy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/967377-amy", "userReview": "This is one of those books I bought because it looked good; it's one of the first editions, although what printing I have no idea. The cover is simply black with gold lettering, the pages uneven and yellowed. It's a beautiful book, and it has that Old Book Smell that I so much love.I picked it up because I had run out of things to read; it's what I do on my lunch at work, and I decided that hey, I'd see what it was like, at least until I found something else to read. And lo and behold, I liked it!It was really interesting to read; the language used is so different, I confess I didn't understand some bits. But aside from the interest I took in the writing, it was a good plot, too. Very grand story, good characters.

I thoroughly detested the dry method of learning about past events in World History class, but this book made history come alive for me as I envisioned exploration in faraway lands. The story has a nice blend of adventure, history, and love as the fate of Walter of Gurney, his friend Tristram, and the exotic Maryam gradually unfolds whilst learning about the predictions of Roger Bacon and the conquests of Bayan of a Hundred Eyes. The Black Rose definitely stands out as one of the better historical fiction books that I have laid eyes on!"}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Mar 14, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3254245-robin", "userReview": "This was wonderful tale brimming with adventure and romance.

On this arduous journey, he grows from a young school boy into a man, he finds treasures he never imagined, and he gains wisdom and clarity.

Set in the time of Edward I, you have the shame of bastardy, uprising against injustice, perilous travel to \"Cathay,\" a slave girl destined for a horrific fate (could she be rescued?), the mysterious revelations of foreign cultures, seperation of the travelers, capture by the Empress of China, separation of the travelers again, more perilous travel, a difficult journey home and dramatic changes there. Not to mention love triangles and royal interference.The Walter of Gurnie in the story is more multi-faceted than stalwart Tyrone Power, and the story more vibrant than the movie. Costain worked as an editor for The Saturday Evening Post as well as an historical novelist, and it's evident in this mixture of commercial history and fiction relying heavily on historic events. It's far from a thriller, but the story keeps you hooked."}, {"userName": "Janette", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3119974-janette", "userReview": "3 1/2 stars. I inherited this book and decided to read it. Written in 1945, it is quite an adventure tale. It takes place at the time of Edward the First in England, and at the time of Bayan of the Hundred Eyes, a mongolian general who conquered China for Kkublai Khan. It is after the crusades and during the Dark Ages. And it all mixes together. There were \"new\" old words on every page, really written with correct names for things of the times. You need a dictionary to understand. I really liked parts of it and loved some of the characters. Walter and Tristam are interesting people and were always true to who they were. I did not like Maryam at all. I made the mistake of watching the 1950 movie trailer and it was terrible. The actors were not well cast (A young Orson Welles as Bayan, in dark makeup, just awful.) It took me a month to read it, with breaks in between. Some of it seemed silly, especially the \"Maryam\" parts. But I can see it could be a big dramatic epic movie today if anyone was interested enough. It is worth reading."}, {"userName": "Trisha Owens", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12183259-trisha-owens", "userReview": "What a delightful book!

Thus ensues danger, adventure, war, and romance. This was one of those really great sprawling historical adventure romance sagas so popular in that era, and I still love them. The author made a noble effort to keep the historical background of the novel accurate, which I love, but he tended to use a lot of medieval terms that were annoying to look up, but educational. I would give five stars for the \"historical\" and five stars for the \"adventure,\" but not the \"romance,\" which tended to be too schmaltzy for my unromantic taste."}, {"userName": "Margie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416455-margie", "userReview": "A fun kickoff-the-summer read, full of old-timey swashbuckling adventure and romance.

Even as a young girl, I remember looking at these books which always appealed to me because of their titles. This 1946 bestseller about Walter a Gurney, a young bastard son of a noble is a fascinating look back into English history in the 1200s. Costain draws on a legend of an English crusader who becomes the father of Thomas a Beckett, and an Eastern girl who only knows two words of English. Costain began the book wanting to write about three individuals: Edward I, King of England; the scientist and visionary thinker, Roger Bacon; and a Mongolian general named Bayon of the Hundred Eyes, who conquered China for Kublai Khan. While the book only deals with these three individuals in a peripheral way, and although dated due to 1940s stereotypes and writing style, this was still a fascinating, though romanticized look into the Dark Ages including changes in the feudal system of England, the advent of the longbow and discovery of gunpowder, as well as the beginning of enlightenment due to the intrepid explorers who returned from fabled Cathay."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/877481-alicia", "userReview": "This book and author were highly recommended to me as great historical fiction. This was a good adventure of a young English noble in the 1300\u2019s who headed to the east to make his fortune.

I have a great fondness for pure romantic adventure such as Dumas and Sabatini wrote. I am shocked I did not hear of this book until now as this is pure adventure. In the late 13th century the bastard son of an English nobleman and his yeoman pal venture to the east to reach \"Cathay\" (China) to find their fortune get caught up in a Mongol invasion and (one character at least) find true love. But what happens to that love when she is lost and he comes face to face with his childhood hearts desire? Well researched too. There are a couple small anachronisms for the medievalist, but they were not glaringly obvious beyond an couple instances of modern idioms creeping into medieval characters' mouths. Certainly not enough so to detract from the story.

It is a very epic story of a young man from England who travels to China to discover many of the wonders and inventions (paper, cannons, etc.)that the English had never even dreamed of. There is a lot of adventure and some romance. It was very well written but with a lot of words common to that era that I had never heard so sometimes it was hard to follow.
