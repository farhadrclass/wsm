Nevertheless, I too was intrigued about what would happen when a highly-acclaimed author of literary fiction transitioned into fantasy. Unfortunately, having read the book, I'm still not even sure.What happened here? It's one of those novels where I can't help wondering if there's some underlying symbolism or metaphorical brilliance that totally went over my head. It's a simplistic, emotionally-detached and - at times - boring story, so I'm inclined to assume Ishiguro was aiming at smarter people than me who would take something deeper from it.But I don't think so. I find myself leaning towards Craig's interpretation that Isiguro gives us the information and lets us decide what to do with it. Interpret as you will, I guess. Especially with that ending that Kirkus believes to be \"one that will shock you\". Well, I would not say I was shocked. I would say I was mildly surprised that Ishiguro had convinced me to keep reading the last 300 pages when all I got was a fizzled out ending and no answers.Screw subtlety and interpretation! I want answers, dammit.Credit where it's due: I was very intrigued in the beginning. I'm fascinated by all kinds of stories about memory and memory loss, whether it's a thriller like The Girl on the Train, a sad contemporary like Still Alice or a fantasy like this. My memories define who I am and the thought of losing them is terrifying to me. Considering that this book opens on a premise of an entire village experiencing weird memory loss - forgetting people who have left, sons they haven't seen in a while, or arguments they just had that morning - I was ready to love it.But the exploration of this memory loss with Axl and Beatrice was unsatisfying and really damn repetitive after a while. I guess people who constantly forget what they have said are likely to keep saying it again but, hell, it makes for a tedious read. I grew tired of hearing about how their son was waiting for them, how Beatrice experienced some pain but, oh, it was nothing really, how maybe they had an argument but neither can remember so let's forget it, and pretty much everything about King Arthur was mind-numbing.Also, I called this emotionally-detached and I'd like to explain what I mean. I don't think we ever develop an emotional connection with the characters. Axl and Beatrice have no personality (does anyone?) and speak so formally to one another. It's so... strange. This has to be the most polite fantasy I've ever read. I know this is set just after the Roman period in Britain but, come on, I find it difficult to believe an old couple spoke to each other like this. And not just them, there are battles and bloodshed and everything is so weirdly polite.Person 1: I say, old chap, I'm afraid I'm going to have to slay you!Person 2: Dear me, that is unfortunate. But fight I shall and perhaps I will win!Yeah, that's not a direct quote, but I swear there are pieces of dialogue like that.And Axl calls Beatrice \"princess\" all the time. ALL THE TIME. I know you might be thinking that's sweet, but ALL THE TIME. At the end of every sentence, he addresses her as \"princess\". When they're afraid for their lives, he manages to find time to slip \"princess\" into every thing he says.This book is weird enough that I'm sure it'll inspire many exciting interpretations, but my imagination isn't playing. It's a boring journey with boring characters and a fabulously anticlimactic non-ending.Blog | Facebook | Twitter | Instagram | Tumblr"}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "1 star - I don't often feel guilty at not being able to finish a book, but I do this time. It's not like I didn't try. I made three attempts to read it.1. I got the book. I read a few chapters. The characters didn't have any personalities, the descriptions of them didn't bring them to life at all and I wasn't enamoured of the setting either. So I gave it up.2. Tried the audio book. Was it going to be any better listening to the story paper-dry protagonists and their fantasy quest. No. My mind kept blanking out and thinking important thoughts like did I add \"kitchen paper\" to the shopping list or did I specify that nice soft Viva one? Stuff like that.3. Last attempt, I got the BBC abridged version. Well, I thought, I'm bound to be able to make it through only 2.5 hours of prose that concentrates on the essence of the book. Failed.It wasn't just that the characters never seemed to be anyone, it was that I kept thinking they were symbols for something and that is why a master author, as Ishiguro certainly is, had written them in such a flat way. But symbols for who or what? I never worked it out. All I got from the book was it was repetitious which made it tedious and not only were the characters forgetting everything, so was I. It never held my attention. So finally, I gave it up. And I feel guilty. Maybe if I'd made it to the end, I would have found it a brilliant piece of writing with endless golden vistas of revelations that slowly appear, delighting with each new and surprising element. But I'll never know, I couldn't wait that long, couldn't get to that point. Tedium overtook me and whispered in my ear 'lots of books on the to-be-read list' and I gave in and gave up."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8525332-andrew", "userReview": "Is it better to remember? Or can we only live with ourselves and one another through ignorance?Kazuo Ishiguro writes a spellbinding fable of one elderly couple's quest for memory. Their journey takes us deep into a nostalgically rendered Dark Age. A post-Arthurian Britain inhabited by the myths and heroes of those isles, and a few more mythic traditions as well. Yet it is a fragile Britain where everything balances on the knife edge: social mores, the civilizational veneer, lifelong marital love, peace itself. Memory plays a double-role here. It holds everything together, pulling back from the edge, while also supplying that gentle, lethal nudge off the cliff. The memory of an infidelity. Of wartime barbarities. Of a lost son. Would we want to forget these things for the sake of contentment but while remaining aware of the veil that separates us from an authentic past? Shades of Orpheus.In Ishiguro's Edenic world, his characters desire a god-like knowledge of the past but at what personal cost? Will they survive? Or will they tip their world into the abyss?Also on Twitter and Tumblr."}, {"userName": "Issicratea", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/23268828-issicratea", "userReview": "The Buried Giant is a subtle and melancholy reflection on memory and forgetfulness and the roles they play both in the lives of individuals and those of countries and peoples. It is the kind of novel that yields up its secrets gradually, and it\u2019s worth persisting with even if you are not initially convinced. It\u2019s a very distinctive work\u2014distinctive to the point of eccentricity\u2014and the reviews have been accordingly mixed, some very negative. To enjoy it, you have to cede to its peculiar, incantatory rhythms, and its layered, sedimentary way of building up meaning. If you do, the rewards are quite rich. The headline news about this novel, Ishuguro\u2019s first in ten years, is all about its flirtation with the fantasy genre.\u201cKazuo Ishiguro ventures into Tolkein territory\u201d is how The Guardian headed its review. You shouldn\u2019t let that put you off if you\u2019re not a fan of fantasy literature, any more than you should be put off Never Let Me Go if you\u2019re not drawn to science fiction. It\u2019s true that, at a literal level, The Buried Giant\u2019s setting is pure fantasy. The narrative unfolds in a remote, post-Arthurian England of Britons and Saxons and knights and ogres and evil monks and dragons and pixies (yes, pixies), with all the potential silliness that implies. That doesn\u2019t make The Buried Giant a fantasy novel, though. In some senses, I think Ishiguro is tending to opt for fantastic\u2014and genreish and clich\u00e9-ridden\u2014narrative territory in his later novels precisely in order to demote the importance of the literal level in his fiction; he has spoken in interviews of his annoyance at readers taking An Artist of the Floating World as being \u201cabout\u201d Japan, or The Remains of the Day \u201cabout\u201d upstairs-downstairs English country house life. The Buried Giant isn\u2019t \u201cabout\u201d pre-Saxon England in any meaningful sense. The Arthurian setting seems to have been chosen to resonate with the novel\u2019s themes of memory and forgetting\u2014this is both a factually \"forgotten\" and a mythologically much-remembered time in English history\u2014and also to evoke medieval romance, as a formal model for this kind of fabulistic, semi-allegorical narrative mode.The Buried Giant is interested in the way in which memory shapes national identities, often to devastating and destructive effect. Embedding a forgotten genocide within a period of English fantasy history traditionally mythologized as a golden age of chivalry is a potent way of exploring this theme; and yet it is purely a vehicle. The buried giants and poisoned scapegoats and black, collective guilts that haunt this novel are those of the present-day world."}, {"userName": "Helen \u03a1\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af

previous Ishiguro novels: The Remains of the Day, Never Let Me Go, and We Were Orphans. I disliked We Were Orphans pretty strongly, and liked Never Let Me Go (probably not as much as I would have if I hadn\u2019t been spoiled for it, and I\u2019d probably like it better on re-read). But Remains of the Day is one of my favorite books of all time. Like, if I had a top ten list of books that represent me and my inner life, this would be on it. So yeah, I had hopeful expectations for this book, but I also knew that sometimes Ishiguro and I just aren\u2019t on the same wavelength. This is one of those times.The Buried Giant is very deliberately constructed, and as piece of literature I do think it has value. I enjoy thinking about it on an intellectual level, but due to stylistic choices Ishiguro made, I did not connect with it the way I have with his writing before.The story takes place in post-Arthurian Britain at a time when the Saxons and Britons were living in tenuous peace with one another. Our heroes are Axl and Beatrice, an elderly married couple who set out one day from their village to seek out their long lost son, whom they barely remember. This is when we learn that the whole country is suffering from a sort of collective amnesia caused by what Axl and Beatrice call \u2018the mist.\u2019 Along the way to their son\u2019s village, they join up with a Saxon knight and a young Saxon boy, as well as an ancient Arthurian knight who has a sacred mission entrusted to him by King Arthur himself. Soon Axl and Beatrice\u2019s journey becomes entangled with that of their companions, and soon they realize they must help to slay a dragon in order to end the curse of the mist and retrieve their memories, not just of their son, but of their entire long lives together, although they recognize that with the good memories the bad will return as well.What follows is a novel that is part allegory (although I hesitate to actually call it that, as with allegory there are only ever direct correlations between ideas, and here they\u2019re more general), part fable, part meditation on memory, violence and revenge. There were individual sections of this book where I found the writing beautiful, and parts where the plights of the characters genuinely moved me, and as discussed previously, I found the whole intellectually interesting. However, I\u2019m not sure Ishiguro\u2019s sparse and deceptively simple style, which worked so well in his previous novels as a way to conceal truths barely hidden under the surface in a more realistic world, worked as well here. Fantasy can be used successfully towards the same function, so the fact that he had the fantasy itself softening his message on top of that seemingly simplistic style meant I had to really work to be engaged while reading. It was almost a soporific effect on me, although I read the book very quickly. It\u2019s more like it put my emotions to sleep and not my brain, and my emotions are my favorite part of reading.All in all: glad I read, probably won't be revisiting in the future, would probably be interested in some deep discussion to unpack it though.Updated 4/22/2015: Well. This was a book. No, just kidding. Sort of.I liked it, but I didn't love it. Honestly, I subtracted almost a whole star just because Axl kept calling his wife \"princess\" every other sentence. But it's a really interesting book that I will have a lot to say about when I can wrap my head around it. For now, you guys should totally check out the interview Kazuo Ishiguro gave to the podcast Geek's Guide to the Galaxy. They talk a lot about how fantasy is perceived by the traditional literary community, an argument which Ishiguro unknowingly stepped in when he decided to write a story using fantasy elements and structures. It's a really interesting conversation, but the best part is when he turns the conversation on the interviewer and starts to go all fantasy noob. For the entire last thirty minutes of the interview, Ishiguro asks the guy all these questions about what fantasy books he should read, whether Neil Gaiman is cool, who is the typical age group for fantasy, what adult fantasy can do. I was laughing at him while listening because it was just sort of surreal to see this author whose books I've loved initiating himself into this genre I love, but it was sweet. I like the guy.Anyway, for now rating this 3.5 stars.

I have read his oeuvre. That's why it pains me a little to say that I found The Buried Giant disappointing. I say this not because I think Ishiguro's skills as a novelist are one whit duller than usual. But because I did not care for the story or its characters. They did not engage me. He's going after a new readership with this book. He's going after the vast fantasy market. That's fine. A writer must write what he must write. Just don't expect me to tag along. In abeyance here is Ishiguro's wonderful sense of humor. The book is stolidly earnest in its depiction of an ogre infested, post Arthurian, post Roman Britain. The first three chapters are straightforward chronology. I suppose I'm used not only to Ishiguro's wit, but also to his keen ability to shift about in time. I understand that a straightforward, unwavering chronology to open the book will have a greater appeal to less nimble readers, but for me \u2014 a reader of subtle capacities \u2014 it was an absolute slog. Only with the introduction of the boy, Edwin, does the narrative start to deepen, but it never achieves true Ishiguroian depths. What do I care about this dead world of British myth?* I've never really cared for Malory's Round Table tales. They're terribly one-dimensional. I tried to read a recent treatment by Peter Ackroyd but it was just so shallow storywise, and redundant. Ishiguro returns the favor. How many times do we have to be reminded that it's better to forget than to remember? Not to mention the interminable politeness of the chivalric code, which, if you do a little reading, you will discover was the exception rather than the rule. Most knights were out for booty and they murdered anyone who got in the way of that goal. Unhindered knights turned Europe into a charnal house. Read Sir Steven Runciman's  A History of the Crusades or Norman Cohn's  Pursuit of the Millennium. Anyway, for me the novel's a dud, though I suspect it will appeal to many new readers. Recommended with reservations. I suppose it's mandatory if you've read all of Ishiguro.I've written reviews of other Ishiguro novels. These include  A View of Pale Hills,  An Artist of the Floating World,  When We Were Orphans and  The Unconsoled.*With one exception, I do admire W.S. Merwin's translation of  Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: A New Verse Translation, but more for the poetry than for the myth.P.S. I disagree with Ms. Kakutani's view (NYT) that Ishiguro's prose here is \"ham handed.\" It is not. He writes as vividly as ever, it's just that the story is a bore. He had to stumble sooner or later. Let's be happy he's gotten this one behind him."}, {"userName": "Jan-Maat", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat", "userReview": "Foolishness, sir. How can old wounds heal while maggots linger so richly? Or a peace hold for ever built on slaughter and a magician's trickery? I see how devoutly you wish it, for your old horrors to crumble as dust. Yet they await in the soil as white bones for men to uncover (p327)Uncanny, haunting, I must have read this novel at the right time for me as it found a sure spot under my skin and disturbed my normally peaceful sleep.It seems to me that Ishiguro is one of those writers who is always writing the same novel, or better said, has an ideal novel inside himself that he approaches from different angles. Each published book an attempt, as on to a mountain, on a different face.I say this because reading the sense of the concern about memory, the workings of the mind, the secrets we hide from ourselves came across to me as being essentially the same here as in The Artist of the Floating World, When we were Orphans, and what I recall of The remains of the Day - though I have the horrible feeling, awful for a reader to confess to that I know the last only from the film. That here there are dragons, ogres, and hobbit like Britons rather than faded artists of Japanese Imperialism is surface ephemera. The theme I take to be the same.Impossible to imagine how a Japanese person, resident in Britain - two Imperial countries with bloody histories that those who have experienced them from a different perspective find that they have not come to terms with - since the age of five might have become so exercised with the issue of people hiding things that they would prefer not to admit to from themselves. Not that the value of forgetfulness, allowing the conscience to sleep with fewer troubles, is a quality unique to those two imperial peoples. In this novel the enforced loss of memory has kept the peace, but prevented healing or true reconciliation. Everything has been hidden. Everybody's past lost. Even every individual couple are impacted by this down to our two principal view point characters the aged Beatrice and Axl. Lone fragments recalled are a source of uncertainty. But part of memory can be resentment, anger, hatred all of which are lost in the collective amnesia. Knowledge, even - or particularly- self knowledge, comes at a cost. Oedipus told us that and how meaningful these old stories still are to us.I was bowled over and completely impressed by this story, another King Arthur story and it is true that I've read plenty since I was small, yet oddly this one captured for me the feeling of Sir Gawaine lost in hill country beyond Cheshire searching for the Green Chapel that combined in my childish imagination with being lost in fog wandering through the park on the way to Junior school, more than many another. Not a book I'll recommend to everyone, but certainly very strongly to some.A couple may claim to be bonded by love, but we boatmen may see instead resentment, anger, even hatred. Or a great barrenness. Sometimes a fear of loneliness and nothing more (p49)"}, {"userName": "Barry Pierce", "userReviewDate": "Mar 03, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4593541-barry-pierce", "userReview": "As someone who has read all of Ishiguro's previous works I was of course more than excited to finally get my hands on a copy of The Buried Giant. Oh boy, if only that excitement hadn't been sourly crushed by the actual contents of this novel. The Buried Giant is very different from all of Ishiguro's other novels. In fact it's so different that I can't even compare it to any of his previous novels. The main difference is of course that this is essentially a fantasy novel. Now I'll be the first to put my hands up and admit that I'm not a massive fan of the fantasy genre. I enjoy the occasional Terry Pratchett novel and I've dipped in and out of the Narnia universe but that's where my fantasy education ends. If there was any author who could get me excited about a fantasy novel, it was Kazuo Ishiguro. This novel is set in the 6th Century, contains references to ogres on the very first page and there's a Beowulfian quest involving a dragon. I'm very much out of my literary comfort zone. The novel begins with two characters, an elderly couple, Axl and Beatrice. At first I really enjoyed these two. In fact I really enjoyed this novel. For, like, the first fifty pages. I really wished Ishiguro just stayed with these two. I enjoyed their company as they set off on a quest to find their son in another village. However, it's when a certain character from Arthurian legend turns up that this novel fell apart in my hands like wet cake. For the remaining 300ish pages this novel stops being Tolkien and turns into Monty Python and the Holy Grail. In fact, when this figure from folklore appears, this novel stops reading like literary fiction and starts reading like, well, fanfiction. At least that's how I felt. And I'm pretty sure Ishiguro didn't intend spending ten years writing Merlin fanfiction but here we are. Nobody was expecting this to be The Remains of the Day (ah, The Remains of the Day, where has the author who wrote you gone?) but since this is Ishiguro's first novel in ten years (with the exception of his rather enjoyable short story collection Nocturnes: Five Stories of Music and Nightfall from 2009) we deserve more from this. I want to burst into Ishiguro's study and shout, \"You wrote The Unconsoled and now you think you can pass off this sub-par fantasy novel as part of your oeuvre?!\". Listen Ishiguro, if you're reading this, I'm not as angry as I am after reading Never Let Me Go (that terrible, terrible novel that I'm still trying to forget) but ugh, you had ten years. Joyce wrote Ulysses in seven. Look Kaz, I just don't know anymore. Three stinkers in a row? (Don't think I've forgotten about When We Were Orphans) I just don't know what to do with you anymore. I'm not angry Kaz, I'm just very disappointed."}, {"userName": "Andrea", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1881113-andrea", "userReview": "Oh boy, this is the book that caused such uproar among Ishiguro fans! Before you pick up this novel, please believe me when I say this is going to be nothing like any of his previous work. So if you are resistant to change, you might want to skip this one. Don\u2019t expect it to be The Remains of the Day, and definitely don\u2019t think this is going to be the next Never Let Me Go. In fact this book won\u2019t even be set in our own time or even plane of reality. On the surface of it all, The Buried Giant is essentially a fantasy novel.Before you are going to throw in the towel though, let me assure you that The Buried Giant still has the impeccable prose and the craftsmanship one comes to expect from Ishiguro. If all fantasy novels were written like this, I wouldn\u2019t struggle so much with the genre. Under its surface, there are philosophical musings and literary allusions, exploration of death and morality, and of course the heartbreaking finale that suddenly explains everything and leaves you breathless. I admire authors that take a step outside of their comfort zones, and Ishiguro surely made a leap here, even by his own standards. I enjoyed his work before, but now I\u2019m really paying attention to this guy.The story begins literally with a blank slate. We are introduced to the world where a strange calamity, referred to only as \u201cthe mist\u201d, makes everyone forget most of their lives. The inhabitants of the village, where elderly Beatrice and Axl reside, go through the motions every day, each one not unlike the other, and never wonder why they cannot recall things that should never be forgotten. One day Beatrice vaguely remembers that the two of them have a son that lives in a different village, and convinces Axl to travel there so they could be together again. On their way they meet fascinating characters, including one from the Arthurian legends, and the peculiar boatman who just might be a more formidable figure than what\u2019s revealed at first. As Beatrice and Axl remember more, and further details about \u201cthe mist\u201d are revealed, so does the story unfold before the reader.So you think you are not a fantasy reader? Do ogres and pixies turn you off from any book that dares to mention them? Never fear. These are just devices used to tell the same story of love and loss that any literary fiction utilizes, just packaged differently. Ishiguro comments on what it means to love your country and make cruel choices out of good intentions, and the neverending cycle of war and hate that plagues the world just by exploring an aging knight\u2019s quest. He poses theological questions on merits of true love and eternity, by letting us join Beatrice and Axl on their journey across the country. He makes us wonder whether things are better left forgotten, and how memories affect who we are today and how we perceive the world before us. Combine it with masterful narration, and I don\u2019t even know what else a reader might need to be happy with the book.While Tolkien might bring similar issues of turmoil and moral dilemmas in his work, Ishiguro\u2019s fantasy is only a means to an end, and not the end in itself.If you find comfort in fables, give this book a shot.If you love deeply touching endings, give this book a shot.If you enjoy authors who take chances, give this book a shot."}, {"userName": "Annet", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1166369-annet", "userReview": "I need to think about this book.

So it is no surprise that his new novel is unlike anything he has written before. Like its predecessors, this novel concentrates on memories: their power to silence, distort, and forever haunt, with characters that are often alienated and searching. Yet the book is distinctly an adventure fable, integrating an ancient British civilization with fantasy.The two questions are: is it good? And is it satisfying? The answer to the first question is absolutely yes. All the trademarks of Ishiguro \u2013 his masterful prose, his characters\u2019 search for meaning and his feats of imagination are all well on display. The answer to the second question is far more subjective and will very much depend on what each individual reader enjoys.The novel takes us into post-Arthurian Britain, populated with those mythic heroes, including a still-living Sir Gawain, yet there\u2019s a twist here: A mist has fallen on Britain, forcing the isle into a collective loss of memory. (\u201cIT\u2019s queer the way the world\u2019s forgetting people and things form only yesterday and the day before that. Like a sickness come over us all.\u201d) Axl and Beatrice (and are we sure these are even their names?) are an elderly couple who visit their adult son, of whom they have only the scantest of remembrances. During their journey, they encounter an honorable knight, a warrior on a quixotic quest, a young boy, a sinister hidden dragon, an evil monk and more, each holding a key to their quest.At its core, The Buried Giant is a fantastical fable, an old-fashioned adventure story with thrills a-plenty. But scratch the surface and you get more. There are allusions to so many other classics: obviously, King Arthur and the Knights of the Roundtable, but also Orpheus and Dante\u2019s Inferno (particularly in the character of Beatrice, the cherished soulmate), and certain childhood fables.We also get an in-depth look at universal themes: memory and forgetfulness, love and aging, war and peace (and how peace can hold \u201cfor ever built on slaughter and a magician\u2019s trickery\u201d and what it takes to be a good and a loving person. From Axl to Beatrice: \u201cFor what good\u2019s a memory\u2019s returning from the mist if it\u2019s only to push away another? Will you promise me, princess? Promise to keep what you feel for me this moment always in your heart, no matter what you see once the mist\u2019s gone.\u201d The narrative builds as it goes along and the central question \u2013 at what price do we remember, at what price do we forget \u2013 is captivating and its broader meaning \u2013 the collective memory loss of a nation is timely. The message is delivered within the fantasy adventure framework, which will appeal to some, but not all readers. I cannot say I loved it (as I loved Remains of the Day, Never Let Me Go, The Unconsoled and other Ishiguro works) but I admired this achievement. And I must admit to a little misting in my own eyes as the fable finally surrenders its secrets."}, {"userName": "Phrynne", "userReviewDate": "Mar 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8655084-phrynne", "userReview": "For the first hundred pages or so I thought I was going to love this book. The idea of the old couple setting off on what amounted to a pilgrimage, the mist and the way people were losing memories and the beautifully executed writing style all added up to a possible five star read. Then just around the half way point I suddenly realised I was a little bored and was starting to skim the longer paragraphs. Part of this was that I had developed an attachment to Axl and Beatrice and did not want to listen to the musings of an elderly knight. Towards the end when the old couple's story took the major focus again I regained my interest and was involved enough to appreciate the way events transpired.

Thank goodness this lived up to (and even exceeded) my expectations. Set in 6th Century Britain, it follows an elderly couple who set out from their village to find their son. I knew nothing about this going into it, so it took me a little while to place it in the fantasy genre. However, this is fantasy in the same way that Never Let Me Go is science-fiction, so the emphasis is on the characters\u2019 relationships and their inner lives. The fantasy elements are there to create a framework for the themes of memory and love that motivate the characters. There is a mist covering the land that causes people to forget elements of their past, so everyone is an unreliable narrator. A few typical Ishiguro traits can be found, such as the emphasis on memory and sparse but evocative description, but it is unlike anything he has written in the past. This is the kind of book that Tolkien might have written had he decided to focus on rich characterisation and relationships rather than the landscape. There are some treats for fans of British legend too, as this is set not long after the death of King Arthur."}, {"userName": "Elaine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2352900-elaine", "userReview": "There are certain writers - David Mitchell, Kate Atkinson, Hilary Mantel, Chiang Rae Lee - where I think, \"OK, I'll follow you anywhere, no matter how weird or improbable that place you want to take me is.\" A Dutch enclave in 18th century Japan? A futuristic Baltimore devoted to pisciculture? 1800 pages telling Tudor history from the vantage point of one of its better known villains? Groundhog Day set in WW2? Yes, and yes, and yes, and yes, and there you have half of my favorite books from the last decade. Ishiguro definitely holds his place in that pantheon of trust. Organ harvesting and a dystopian British boarding school? Yes! Mosleyites in an uglier (and realer) version of Downton Abbey? Yes! And so, based on that trust, I tried and tried again to give myself over to this pastiche of Arthurian legend, which has been billed as a \"fantasy novel,\" but is told more in the limpid aphoristic tones of fable. But I failed. The writing, lyrical in places and clumping in others, tripped me up. The plot (such as it was) dragged, with the foreboding atmosphere a bit of an overmatch for the reveal at the end. The Buried Giant worked for me as concept, as meditation on memory and genocide, on love and loss. But it didn't work for me as a novel, and if Ishiguro's project was to deracinate his story so that we focused more on the concepts and less on the trappings of setting and narrative, then I think his project failed because the weird setting and characters distracted me, like a tooth that you can't stop worrying at.

I was far from disappointed\u2026 \u2018The Buried Giant\u2019 is a hauntingly evocative, compelling and intelligent story set in a post-Roman, post-Arthurian Britain. Ostensibly this is a story with a \u2018Fantasy\u2019 setting \u2013 and on one level very much of that genre and whilst there are nods to and echoes of Tolkien et al, the \u2018Fantasy\u2019 setting is just that, a \u2018setting\u2019 only, providing a backdrop to the big themes that Ishiguro is exploring here.In one sense, \u2018The Buried Giant\u2019 is akin to an Arthurian (style) legend, a journey, a quest and all that goes with that \u2013 it does feel in some sense like a fable, a parable, a legend, mythological and elemental; referencing not only Cervantes\u2019 \u2018Don Quixote\u2019, but the likes of Eco\u2019s \u2018Name of The Rose\u2019.On another level however, Ishiguro\u2019s novel is all about memory, loss and remembrance \u2013 it\u2019s about the suppression of past deeds, wrongs done, the denial of past \u2018evils\u2019; it\u2019s about the legitimisation of war and slaughter on the basis of future peace, the questioning of \u2018ends justifying the means\u2019. Confronting, rationalising and coming to terms with a sometimes ugly and difficult past.The narrative of \u2018The Buried Giant\u2019 is delivered by Ishiguro ostensibly on two key levels \u2013 there is the very personal story of Axl and Beatrice and their journey to find their son; the journey that they must go on and their remembrance of things past \u2013 past wrongs being remembered, righted or at least confronted; the healing of old wounds, the journey of life along with a ultimately a contemplation of death and isolation. On another level, \u2018The Buried Giant\u2019 is all about the \u2018wrongs\u2019 done at societal level, mass slaughter and genocide \u2013 the subsequent acceptance and justification of same and ultimately the rewriting of both memory and history in order to deliver an acceptable and palatable story, A process of forgetting, remembrance and rationalisation or suppression of the past. Therefore, \u2018The Buried Giant\u2019 is all about not just individual, but more importantly collective amnesia.\u2018The Buried Giant\u2019 is a great book, so very well delivered \u2013 haunting, memorable, effective, affecting, compelling, amusing, exciting; ambitious in scope \u2013 simple yet complex, thought-provoking, evocative and intelligent \u2013 a great adventure and a great story, what more could you want? Highly recommended."}, {"userName": "Maciek", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek", "userReview": "Kazuo Ishiguro's latest book came as a surprise. It's been 10 years since his last novel, Never Let Me Go, and apart from a lone collection of short stories - Nocturnes: Five Stories of Music and Nightfall in 2009 - the author has largely been silent. The Buried Giant appeared suddenly and unexpectedly, without much fanfare - shouldn't it be a big deal?Ishiguro's latest book is very different from the two of his novels that I have read, The Remains of the Day and Never Let Me Go - both of which were set in contemporary, recognizable times. The Buried Giant takes place in the distant past - so distant that it's the stuff of myths and legends. It is set in Britain after the death of King Arthur, a country divided between Britons and Saxons. Although the wars have ended, there is a sense of aversion between the two groups - and a mist seems to have fallen over the entire land, clouding memories and perception: there is talk of monsters and mythical creatures roaming in the wilderness.The novel focuses on an elderly couple, Axl and Beatrice, who set out on a quest to find their son whom they both only dimly remember having. Axl and Beatrice are deeply devoted to one another - he refers to her only as \"Princess\" - but both can't even remember what their son looked like, as they have not seen him in many, many years. But their situation is not unique - a kind of a mist has set over the land and shrouded everything, and other villagers have similar trouble remembering details from their own lives.On their journey Axl and Beatrice will cross many paths, and meet several characters that will accompany them on their way, with nothing being quite what it seems. Ishiguro succeeds in creating a sense of mystery and strangeness reminiscent of folk fables and fairy tales, a opaque world surrounded with fog and dew; dreams mix with reality, and perception is not entirely reliable. What I had trouble with was the book's slow pace, but this might be excused; after all it might be deliberate, to signify that the novel is about transition, and one that might not even be completed, and end up as some kind of a limbo. What lost me was the introduction of a well-known figure from the Arthurian legends, who became a major character in the story. This is where I pretty much lost interest - I felt that this character took the focus away from Ishiguro's own creations, to overall detriment. Fantasy fans are most likely to be disappointed by The Buried Giant - it does feature several staples of the genre, but mostly focused on theme of selective, incomplete memory, which is present in the two other novels by him that I have read. Ironically, I found the book to be hard to remember - it's deliberately constructed to obfuscate and hide true meaning and intent, which will undoubtedly satisfy many readers but also turn away many others. As always, ultimately the best way to see which camp you fall in is to read the book yourself - but if you'll find your attention slipping away, perhaps your memory will be better served by something else."}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Oct 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "The Raindrops of Our Memories\u201cBut then again I wonder if what we feel in our hearts today isn't like these raindrops still falling on us from the soaked leaves above, even though the sky itself long stopped raining.

Ishiguro, The Buried GiantThere are times, I think, one must admit bewilderment and a certain lack of knowledge or learning to fully understand some novels, but can nonetheless say that the story impacted him; that, in a relatively short read, he inhabited the phenomenal, yet surreal, atmosphere of dense fog that enveloped the terrain and the faded memories of the protagonist medieval married couple (and of all the population in the mystical land); that he felt for the couple and their lost memories and, most importantly, that he has a deeper understanding, from having read this book, of how much memories are a significant part of who we are and of our love for those in our lives, and yet at the same time our love is more than memories: true love is in our souls and as long as we can see and know those we love, our love will not die, in spite of our vanishing remembrances.

He can master the alternative present (Never Let Me Go), the WW II era (several), and, in this latest novel, the ancient past. He consistently pens flawed narrators that make critical, life-changing choices. And the narrators often leave their geographic comfort zone.THE BURIED GIANT is a combination myth, legend, allegory, adventure, and fantasy. I didn't know if it would capture my attention when I started it, because I tend to avoid medieval or Dark Age stories and (post) Arthurian legends with ogres and knights. However, this is no standard fare fantasy. Ishiguro is a wordsmith whose language stirs you to your emotional core. He is in touch with the sadder and more poignant losses of life, which he incorporates with organic and powerful subtlety. Essentially, Ishiguro is a writer of mankind's contradictions, and he accesses our deepest fears and our dearest desires.The conundrum here is the sovereignty of our memories, and a mist that shields us from summoning them. Are we better off not knowing all the shadows and corners of our past? It reminds me a bit of a book I recently read called J, by Howard Jacobson, and the movie Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. These latter are very different in content, but all three works of art explore the power of memory and how it affects our current ability to live an authentic life, and to genuinely know happiness and sorrow. Is life better that way, to forget? He ties nothing in a bow, but rather creates distinguishing knots. At the end, I am left pondering with a mixture of melancholy and release.\"This country awakens so many memories, though each seems like some restless sparrow I know will flee any moment into the breeze.\"Ishiguro's chemical concoction of magic and simplicity, of history and lore, is a tale of mystic imagination, adventure, forgiveness, and fabled truths.
