I was almost immediately disappointed. Four strangers decide to take a road trip together after barely meeting one another while each is struggling with their own demons. One of them is a psychic (hard to read about when you don't believe in that stuff), and she seems to be the one guiding the rest. The description made it sound like a long road trip with lots of adventure. It was actually brief and the women split up half way through. They travel with an elderly lady who has been hoarding prescription drugs leftover from her family and it constantly giving them out. No one seems to be concerned that they are taking a drug that was not prescribed for them. Then twice these women pick up a total stranger along the way and one ends up knifing them and then they go on to pick up another. Hello. Lessons??? There is no real bonds formed at all and the only reason I couldn't put it down, was because I couldn't wait for it to end.

The only reason I kept reading was in hopes of it getting better, it never did! The characters are so naive they seem ignorant and the 23 year old psychic? Really?

McQuestion has a genuineness that comes through the pages. She tells a story that any woman can relate to. The story is about how grief brought some very different women together and how each gave the other something that they did not even know they needed. I marveled while watching the women evolve and create bonds while they traveled across the county. I laughed, was moved, cheered and honestly, at times, wanted to yell at the ladies. This novel speak volumes to how grief can take over your life and how friendship can transform you!!! I highly recommend it and rate is 4.5 stars!!!!"}, {"userName": "Keri Piercy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5133776-keri-piercy", "userReview": "I discovered this book through an Amazon Kindle recommendation.

This review reflects my honest opinion. By a series of coincidences, a group of women who were formerly strangers befriend each other and end up in a car on a road trip to Las Vegas. One of the women is psychic, one woman's boyfriend recently died, another is a reclusive widow, and the fourth is the mother of a young woman who was murdered. They are certainly an eclectic bunch and putting the four of them together makes for quite an adventure. This was a fast-moving and enjoyable read; however, I found it a bit unbelievable. Don't get me wrong, I liked reading it and I was interested in following all the different plot lines to the end, but it definitely required a suspension of disbelief. By the third time a scene resolved itself by a stranger coming along at just the right time, I knew I had to just roll with it and stop thinking this story could have really happened. I know it's fiction, so it doesn't really matter if it could happen or not, but I do think it's a fair assessment. The characters are endearing, but occasionally irritating -- I guess that's what happens when a group of strangers are thrust together. They each evolve, face challenges, and learn things about themselves. While it's not an overly \"deep\" novel, it offers a good message about overcoming life's obstacles and becoming a better person. Overall, this was a light, \"feel-good\" read, perfect for a lazy day at the beach.

The story involves women meeting at a grief support group. A much younger woman comes rushing in because she\u2019s psychic. She doesn\u2019t really belong there; she just arrives because voices tell her to go somewhere, and she wanders around until the feeling gets stronger, and she ends up there. Meh. It started to lose me at that point. I set it aside. Since I\u2019m supposed to read this for a book group, I decided maybe the audiobook would work. I could listen to it while I did other things. That was a mistake. The narrator is a female Mr. Rogers. She reads as if she\u2019s reading to little children, and she drove me insane. I wanted to shake her and tell her to read faster or add some inflection or something. It was bad. I set it aside again. I eventually picked up my Kindle again and tried for the third time to read it. I discovered it wasn\u2019t the narrator. It\u2019s the book. It doesn\u2019t get better. It just drones on in an overly simplistic manner. It reads like a kid\u2019s book with two-dimensional, boring characters. There\u2019s no depth, and there\u2019s nothing interesting about these people. The main character, Marnie, is grieving because the man she lived with has died. She calls him her fianc\u00e9, but they were never going to get married. I\u2019m not sure why she misses this man so much. He sounded like a jerk. Marnie reveals that she fell out of love with him a long time ago. [Excerpt: \u201cI was living with someone,\u201d Marnie said, sighing. \u201cA man. He was my fianc\u00e9, but we never got close to getting married. We probably never would have married, actually,\u201d she said, being truthful. Brian had talked of marriage but never gave her a ring, never even discussed setting a date. Over the years, she found herself falling out of love with him, but she never considered breaking up and moving out, not even once.]Why the heck did she stay? Where is this woman\u2019s backbone? Her car doesn\u2019t start, and she has no clue what to do. Duh. Call a garage, call 911, walk to a corner store and ask for assistance. Do freaking something; don\u2019t just sit there like a useless lump until the psychic comes along and rescues you. If no one had come, she would\u2019ve sat there until she starved to death. For God\u2019s sake, I hated this character. Marnie is TSTL.The young girl who is the psychic was a little more interesting, but she is so ridiculously happy, and everything is so wonderful. If I was hearing dead people talking to me all the time, I\u2019m not sure I would be full of sunshine and unicorns and rainbows. Give me a break. She\u2019d be a little edgier, don\u2019t you think? If the author had made her darker, I think I could have gotten into that, but no, Jazzy (her name is Jessica, but she prefers \u2018Jazzy\u2019) is so \u201cjazzy\u201d-like. Oh, brother.I needed stronger characters with more depth and more intelligence. If they\u2019re weak, that\u2019s okay, but give me a reason why they are weak. Marnie is dull, and I don\u2019t care what happens to her or Jazzy or the other two unfortunate characters that go on a mystery road trip with them.

There's a bit of paranormal stuff in here, but it's not so much that you want to reject the book as being silly. Young Jazzy has always had the ability to hear spirit voices, and most often the voice she hears is that of hear deceased grandma. Jazzy is compelled one night by her grandmother's voice to drop by a grief counseling session. Her bubbly positive personality uplifts everyone in the group, and soon all of them are talking about doing things they might not otherwise have considered. Marnie, for example, wants to go to Las Vegas to see her stepson. The boy was taken from her when his father, with whom Marnie lived, suddenly died. Rita's daughter was murdered when the girl was in her 20s, and Rita, too, wonders whether a change of scene wouldn't help her deal with her years-long grief. Laverne is Marnie's reclusive landlady, and she has never been out of Wisconsin. At the last minute, she throws in with the other women, and their cross-country extravaganza begins. Although Jazzy is the youngest of the women, it is she to whom the others look for direction. She communicates to them the need to stop at a specific Colorado locatoin that holds a clue to the whereabouts of the man who ended Rita's daughter's life. Before this road trip ends, all of the women have changed in positive ways.I enjoyed this author's writing style; this isn't her first book, but it's the first book she has written that I've read. While it's true that parts of it seemed a bit contrived, I retained my interest in the book and found much to cheer for where the four women are concerned."}, {"userName": "Sandra", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/330479-sandra", "userReview": "A really good cozy read, a few typos, but nothing extreme. I liked the storyline about four women who didn't know each other, each in a different situation that come together in a road trip to help one of them. It gives each ones story, going back and forth, and I really enjoyed it. Karen McQuestion is a new-to-me author, for Kindle reads, and has written five books. This one is free through Kindle Unlimited.From Amazon: Four women bound by chance take the trip of a lifetime in Karen McQuestion's fifth novel The Long Way Home. For Wisconsinites Marnie, Laverne and Rita, life isn't working out so well. Each is biding time, waiting for something better, something to transport them out of what their lives have recently become. And then there's Jazzy: bubbly, positive, and happy even though she hears voices of the departed. Brought together by a chance meeting, the women decide to join Marnie on a road trip from Wisconsin to Las Vegas where she intends to reunite with Troy, the boy she raised as her own\u2014and who she\u2019s been separated from since her boyfriend\u2019s death.

It was grating.The characters lacked depth and believability. As others have noted, the elderly LaVerne carried around a baggie of her family's prescription and OTC medications and cheerfully doled out uppers, downers and pain medications to members of the trip. She is never challenged, even by doctors in a hospital, for having and giving out these meds, and the others in her party treat her as their pharmacy. The young psychic Jazzy takes charge of the group, and they all follow her like sheep. The widow Marnie, who is actually mourning the loss of her stepson, not her ex-boyfriend, cannot distinguish between a 14 year old who has been abandoned in the middle of nowhere by his custodial parent and an 18 year old sociopath. Further, although mourning the loss of her own 14 year old and therefore supposedly \"in tune\" with 14 year old boys, she feels okay to allow the supposed 14-year old to leave a custodial situation to go hitchhike off to who-knows-where.And then there is the whole subplot revolving around the murderer of Rita's daughter 10 years ago ...I am sorry I listened to the whole thing ..."}, {"userName": "Eva", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/892878-eva", "userReview": "I'm a little surprised I rated this so high - there was a moment in the middle where I couldn't take the pace. I was tempted to skip ahead but that is difficult with a digital edition. In the end I enjoyed the book - a bit of summer fluff reading. The latter half of the book had me still wishing I could skip ahead because I was wondering what would happen next. The plot surprised me - I didn't see it coming and that always gets the author at least one star. Writing was easy and smooth - only one or two minor moments I would have edited. Digital edition is phenomenally cheap ($2.99). (Full disclosure: this is what I read in triple digit heat and no electricity. My time to read was fragmented and uncomfortable - and this may account for my dislike of the book in the middle.

I liked how Karen McQuestion wove in that LaVerne's problem was sleep anpnea not depression alone. Hopefully it will cause others to think also. The circumstances of incidences that happen we think as an interruption-- breaking down on the side of the road, only to find that is where Rita's resolution needed to be and Jazzy meeting Carson--is an example to us to look for, or be patient with interruptions for what they might lead us to.
