Miranda went to my high school and was an aquaintance of mine. Seeing as \"be published\" is on my bucket list (I really hate that term - have to come up with an alternate name), I grit my teeth as I read her acknowledgements and her dedication. Perhaps my jealousy had more to do with her jacket picture - still looking as great as she did in high school. Regardless, though I was prepared to hate the book out of sheer spite, I found myself liking her style - reminiscent of Alice Munro, with strong characters and situations. Definitely worth the read."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5143064-andrew", "userReview": "We turn the pages back. Carlos says Gibson is pale so that the light can shine through him. Micheline says he needs a little more sun. She will take him to Florida, she says, when he is well enough to stand the drive. To me, he looks as vulnerable as those girls in high school whose hips jutted up against the pocket rivets of their jeans. The ones everyone always tiptoed around: a fracture waiting to happen. The world pressed in closer on those among us who were cushioned by flesh, as if that offered sufficient protection. Despite the skin and the veins, Gibson has hands that look big and capable. They look like hands that could have hung on. But there are things you can\u2019t know from looking.The first time my husband hit me, we were in the bathroom, so it was hard to tell whether the darker bruise was from Cy\u2019s hand or from the edge of the sink I hit going down. I felt across the floor to see if I would find blood, but the tiles were dry. When I pulled myself up, I held onto the vanity and stood in front of the mirror as long as I could. The red was spreading under my skin, my cheek, and my forehead was swelling. It looked like it should hurt. I couldn\u2019t even remember Cy\u2019s fist on me. It was as if something had pushed its way out from the inside like a latent cancer. \u201cThis is how I look as a beaten woman,\u201d I said. I tried it on like a uniform, and felt it settle on me like something I was always meant to wear.***An interesting thing happened to me while reading Miranda Hill\u2019s debut collection, Sleeping Funny. I started to envision a small town in the middle of nowhere, like something out of a Tim Burton film: prim and precise, every hedge cut to the same height with the same car parked in the same driveway of every cardboard cutout house. The town changed as the years passed\u2014from Gothic nineteenth century underpinnings, to post-World War II a flag-in-every-shop patriotism, to more modern day aesthetic flavours\u2014yet remained forever apart, an island unto itself, carved from the world. The nine stories collected in this book are tinged with slightly off-colour characters\u2014exaggerations, islands of their own neither here nor there, but relatable all the same.In \u201cThe Variance\u201d, an infection is moving through Glenmount Crescent, a Pleasantville stand-in of hyphenated this-meets-that families, white picket fences, and crab apples littering lawns and sidewalks. Michal, the matriarch of the recently moved-in Revivo-Smitherman family, is an albatross\u2014an \u201cother\u201d who represents what Imogene and Adelaide and other mothers in the neighbourhood fear most: change.\u201cApple\u201d is about sex. Not just sex, but the worst sex a teenager can imagine: parental sex. Possibly the most magical story of the collection, the titular Apple is forced to bear witness to unending images of her parents and the parents of classmates engaged in intercourse. Going deeper (pun not intended), \u201cApple\u201d is about the teenage imagination regarding sex, and beyond sex, the idea of procreation\u2014romanticizing and planning the moment, not wishing one\u2019s existence and self worth to be the result of a mere act of lust but of careful, calculated planning.\u201cPetitions to St. Chronic\u201d is one of the strongest stories in this collection\u2014it also happens to be the story that won Hill the Journey Prize. It\u2019s a beautiful, lyrical piece mapping the parallels between severe depression and suicide, and acquiescence and spousal abuse: exploring the scars that are not so readily seen\u2014not before it\u2019s too late.Following such a strong tale is unfortunately one of the weakest of the lot: \u201c6:19\u201d. A simple tale of a government employee tired of his hum drum routine, fantasizing about the seemingly idyllic existence of a woman who is not his wife tending a garden that is not his own as he watches from the window of his stopped train. On one hand, the main character is emotionally uninteresting\u2014but on the other hand, such emotional reticence could be argued as a deliberate tactic, to further illustrate his inaction and how it has helped settle him into a life he no longer desires. Whatever the intent, I felt kept at arm\u2019s length throughout this entry.\u201cBecause of Geraldine\u201d is a story of regrets, of second-bests in love and settling for a life that offers a great deal\u2014a family, kids and a wife and love and happiness\u2014but is missing that small taste of something\u2026 special. Because, \u201cMaybe only those things that were left behind felt sad. Maybe our father would feel it too. And I tried to imagine what it would be like to be his second biggest regret.\u201d\u201cPrecious\u201d is far and away the strongest of the collected stories. Both moving and unnerving, it depicts in much the same way as the aforementioned \u201cPetitions to St. Chronic\u201d scars that are nigh impossible to see. It is about expectations versus reality: the all-too common crime of parents, playing favourites with their children, harbouring unfair expectations on their offspring before they can even begin to realize their potential. The narrative alludes to the first-born, Alex, as being deficient in some way\u2014disappointment accentuated when the impossibly perfect Kristi-Anne is brought into his world and he is pushed into the shadows, deliberately forgotten by his parents to disastrous results. The story\u2019s final moments and the unexpected tragedy spurned from parental neglect offer the most emotionally accomplished beats the book has to offer.In \u201cDigging For Thomas\u201d, a mother looks after her son following the war-time death of her husband in a small community where everyone knows everyone, and the death of a single person casts ripples from one end of the town to the other. Contrasting with \u201cPrecious\u201d and \u201cPetitions to St. Chronic\u201d, the mother in \u201cDigging For Thomas\u201d is scarred, visibly, for all to see, though there is not a cut anywhere on her. The tragedy she\u2019s endured is known and understood by all, though commentary\u2014and eye contact\u2014is kept at a minimum, as if death were an indecency better left unspoken.\u201cRise: A Requiem\u201d is the most unconventional, and also the most ineffective story in the collection. Written as the 1889 testimony of Enoch Carlisle, former Reverend of St. Andrew\u2019s Presbyterian Church, the story details horrors done in the name of medicine that might be construed as villainy, or as a miracle without explanation. Either way, the theme presented is a foreboding one: the apocalypse is a mortal life, and the greater of evils belongs to men.\u201cSleeping Funny\u201d follows a Lorelei and Rory Gilmore-like mother-daughter pair: the still-clinging-to-the-past Clea, and her self-sustaining child, Minnie, who is clearly Clea\u2019s emotional rock. Leaving a never-ending string of dead fish in her wake, Clea has allowed her life to lapse into a coma following the death of her father. When elements of her past force her to examine mistakes and choices made, Clea learns that though she has not necessarily moved on from her past, her past has moved on from her, and it\u2019s up to her whether or not she wants to catch up with it and start living her life again.Hill\u2019s writing is, to use one of my favourite words, layered. Her imagery is strong throughout this collection; every sentence has a purpose, a reason for existing. Everything about the stories presented in Sleeping Funny feels carefully constructed, as if little was left to chance. The consequence of that, whether intentional or not, is the previously mentioned island effect: the feeling that these stories exist in a highly manicured world of visual cues and delicate, premeditated aesthetic choices. Keep in mind this is by no means a complaint. Sleeping Funny is one of the strongest short story collections I\u2019ve read this year. Hill\u2019s choices, however careful they may or may not have been, go a fair distance in creating the feeling of a historical artefact\u2014a village tome united by its scars, by its resistance to change, throughout time. Even \u201c6:19\u201d and \u201cRise: A Requiem\u201d, though not the strongest narratives in the collection, are engaging, textured examinations of individuals in strange, potentially unexplainable circumstances. However, it is on the strength of \u201cThe Variance\u201d, \u201cPetitions to St. Chronic\u201d, \u201cPrecious\u201d, and \u201cSleeping Funny\u201d that this collection receives my utmost recommendation."}, {"userName": "Nicola Mansfield", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1682713-nicola-mansfield", "userReview": "I had no idea who Melanie Hill was when I started to read this collection except that she is the wife of the award-winning Canadian author Lawrence Hill. As I started reading Ms. Hill's stories I was astounded at how much I enjoyed them and I truly loved the outlook on life that they presented, though not always happy endings. I had to stop after a few and google her to find out if she was Catholic as she read to me like a Catholic author. Very little is available about her online but I did come across a CBC interview with her where she remarks that her work often carries the theme of miracles perhaps attributed \"to being sent to Catholic school, even though my family wasn't Catholic. I was the little girl in the back pew, watching the other kids drink the wine that had been turned into blood.\" These stories are wonderful and while a couple fell flat with me the others were so outstanding I was entirely satisfied with this collection and can't wait to read more from the author. My favourite stories were \"Because of Geraldine\", \"Apple\" and \"Rise: A Requiem (with parts for voice and wing\".1. The Variance - At sixty-two pages the first story in this collection could be called a novella as it reads like one with breaks for changes of view and passage of time. I quickly settled into the community in which this is set: the upper-middle class street of lawyers' and doctors' families with their children and nannies. Mothers who have high profile jobs but try to outdo each other with their commitments at the school to which all their children go. Everything is peaceful and the same here until the Revivo-Smithermans move in to the old Anderson house. They don't fit, especially Michal. She turns her front lawn into a garden. She has huge flyaway frizzy hair. She wears her baby in a sling. She is always home. She seems to have all the time in the world. The street at first ignores them, then feels them an irritation, until the day Michal hands out notices that she is requesting a zoning variance ... and they learn who she really is. Personally, I related most to Michal and loved her quiet effect on the neighbourhood women. She is a strong character, even though she remains mysterious and I was very satisfied with the ending. Great introduction to this author! (4/5)2. Apple - SPOILERS. I love this so much I just have to talk about it spoilers and all. This is a bit of magical realism. The Grade 8 class usually hands out (fake) electronic babies for the class to look after as part of the Family Studies class. But they were broken this year and a new teacher took over. She did something which made the class able to see her parents in flagrante delicto at the time that she was conceived. Looking around the class every student was able to see this of the other students. Outside of the class they could see this of everyone they met. They couldn't see their own though; someone else had to tell them what they saw. Many are embarrassed, hurt or shocked by the circumstances under which they see themselves and others were conceived. The ability eventually goes away and is not discussed in class but it has lasting effects on the narrator who later chooses abstinence with her boyfriend, not trusting birth control as 100%, and \"for our kid, I'd want something better.\" Boyfriend agrees with a smile. An \"out there\" story but brilliantly pro-life! (5/5)3. Petitions to St. Chronic - A man jumps from a 24 story building and survives. It is a miracle! Three strangers gather to keep vigil at the hospital wanting to see him when he comes round: a Catholic man, a woman with a history of helping broken men and the narrator, an abused wife. Wonderful! A story of healing but not for the one you would think. Loved the religious overtones. (5/5)4. 6:19 - A man's train pulls over every evening at 6:19 to let another train pass and while he watches out the window a woman gardening in her backyard, he starts to fantasize about her and her home. The story is really much more complicated than that and more about the man's feelings about his life, marriage, job: the worthiness and purpose of it all rather than having any plot. I just didn't like this guy and couldn't care about the story. (3/5)5. Because of Geraldine - The eldest daughter of a couple narrates as she reflects back on her parents marriage which was always overshadowed by the father's first true love who ran away to Nashville to be a star. Then Geraldine returns one evening to play at the local legion and everything for her parents will forever be changed. Absolute sweet, pure perfection!! I can't imagine any story being better than this one. My favourite in the collection! (5/5)6. Precious - At 49 pages this is the second longest story in the collection so far and could be called a novella by some. It is a completely compelling story. It is a sad story and one finds it hard to like the characters. Alex is seven when his baby sister is born. Alex is described as having a Picasso painted face and a twisted frame. He receives little affection from his parents but when his undeniably beautiful sister is born he is merely tolerated as long as he doesn't interfere with the sister. The mother obsesses and overprotects Kristi-Anne to such an extreme extent that she shares her room with her and the father is delegated to the couch, but the father is awed by his daughter and the new maternal instincts of the mother have made him fall in love with and respect her once again. The ending is ambiguous. It certainly is tragic for all concerned asking them realise what is truly precious in the end, but is the final event a release or tragedy for the one most concerned. Thought provoking! I still like \"Because of Geraldine\" better but this is still worthy of (5/5)7. Digging for Thomas - Quite a short story this time. A woman's husband is off to war, probably WWII. She notices that his things are slowly disappearing, little things like pipe and socks and she gathers more of these items together and leaves them for \"them\" to take. After they receive word of his death in action, she and their little son work on a little garden which seems to represent the man's life to them. Then one not-so-fine day a big storm comes along breaking a secret and pulling apart the planted garden. One sees the characters learn to accept death for what it is. Only ok compared to the others. (3/5)8. Rise: A Requiem (with parts for voice and wing) - Splendid! Set in the late 1800's we have a Gothic story of a minister on trial, doctors using corpses for practice, grave-robbing and the Apocalypse. What a tale. Absolutely delicious! I loved it! (5/5)9. Sleeping Funny - A woman returns to her small home town after fleeing from it to Vancouver to have a baby out of wedlock. She's always made excuses not to return. Her mother's died and now her father is so ill, she finally must return to look after him for his final time, however long that will be. Her young daughter becomes attached to Grampa, reading him stories, but eventually he dies and now the house has been inherited by the daughter. A story of running away from home is really one of running from oneself, and upon returning one doesn't have to deal so much with what was left behind but with who the person was when they were running and coming to terms with the problem that still exists never going away until she came back to face it. A nice story, I enjoyed the characters very well, especially the daughter Melanie, but I did find my mind wandered through the reading. Probably the weakest story in the collection.

Could it have anything to do with the fact that she's married to Lawrence Hill?Barring any conspiracy theories, I would imagine that it was published for those 20-or-30-somethings who have a lot of time to kill at the doctor's office and need to find a little time-waster. The prose is clean and straightforward and easy to read -- but it is so uninspired as to make it a real snoozer. Perfect for pre-op situations. The book jacket promises intelligence and humour that \"...keeps you reading with growing admiration and delight.\" The jacket also promises that the writer has an uncanny ability to inhabit the voice of a teenager, of a middle-aged country minister of the last century and of a young pilot's widow in WWII all the while making it sound, and feel like she \"owns\" the voice. Ummm ... ok. If the jacket says it's so, then it must be so.To me, everyone sounded the same, and the 40-something professionals sounded exactly like the angst-ridden sex-crazed teenagers who sounded exactly like the hand-wringing soul-searching mother in the last story of the book. No subtleties here. Why do I then assign it 2 (astronomical) stars -- pun intended. For what it is -- and not what it purports to be -- it is good copy that can be found in any Chatelaine or Canadian Living mag -- and helps to pass the time at any given professional's (or tradesman's ) office in English-speaking countries."}, {"userName": "Sharon Plett", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11501747-sharon-plett", "userReview": "This was my first Goodreads giveaway and it was an excellent gift. I don't normally buy short story collections, so my initial reaction upon learning that Sleeping Funny was a collection of stories was not that enthusiastic.

Hill's stories are at times haunting, beautiful, whimsical, and even downright funny. She uses everyday characters and situations, with a healthy dose of magic realism, to discuss larger themes such as conformity, alienation, family, and acceptance. Hill's characters are so well developed, you feel as if you know them intimately, which is quite the accomplishment considering the limitations of short fiction. I think it may be one of the best short fiction collections I have read since graduate school. The only thing that bothered me was the way the collection was organized. I do not think the collection should lead with \"The Variance,\" as it is a complicated story that did not make me enthusiastic to read the rest of the work. Other stories such as \"Petitions to St. Chronic\" and \"6:19,\" seem more reflective of Hill's style and would be a great introduction to her writing style. That being said, going back to \"The Variance\" allowed me to have a better appreciation for that story.All in all, that is a minor criticism when you consider the excellent writing and well developed narratives that await you in this collection. This book is a must for anyone who loves short fiction, and I would highly suggest that those who do not think they do should give it a try as well. A beautiful debut from a highly talented writer. I cannot wait to read Hill's future work."}, {"userName": "Ania Szado", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2456444-ania-szado", "userReview": "Such a great read! This is a collection with no filler--every story is precise, accomplished, and meticulously honed. Each is also distinct, not only in its characters and situations, but also in its tone, language, rhythms and in the ways it engages the reader. And every story is engaging: in turns, they are poignant, funny, intellectually exciting, moving, emotionally haunting. No matter where the author took me--from the most grounded of circumstances to otherworldly situations--I was like putty in her hands. Almost every time I finished a story, I thought it was my favourite... until I started reading the next one.I found the diversity of this collection inspiring. It demonstrates brilliantly how deep immersion in one's characters and their worlds can give rise to a distinctive voice and imbue a story with authenticity--no matter what one is writing about, and even when that voice and those authentic worlds change so significantly from story to story. SLEEPING FUNNY is an enormously satisfying read.

Here is a writer who can seamlessly inhabit the consciousness of a sixteen-year-old navigating an embarrassing sex-ed class, a middle-aged minister experiencing a devastating crisis of faith in a 19th century rural village, a pilot's widow coping with her grief by growing an unusual \"victory garden\" during World War II, and well-heeled modern professional women juggling jobs, kids, and husbands, and trying to cope with the arrival of a beautiful bohemian neighbour, on a gentrified street in downtown Toronto.The qualities that unite these remarkable stories are a pervasive sense of mystery and magic, a wonderful wit and sophistication, and most surprisingly, the slight disorientation implied by the title: In Miranda Hill's beguiling universe, the \"real world\" is recognizable and slightly askew, as if you were experiencing one of those strange dreams where you think you are awake--or as if you've been \"sleeping funny\" and are on the cusp of waking into the everyday world you thought you knew.", "title": "Sleeping Funny", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13536358-sleeping-funny", "average": 3.74, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344368817l/13536358.jpg", "reviews": 32, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6448995.Miranda_Hill", "name": "Miranda  Hill"}], "type": ["Short Stories", "Fiction", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13536358-sleeping-funny", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16071785-sleeping-funny"]}
