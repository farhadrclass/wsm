I got a little irritated at times by Mrs Tompkin\u2019s disappointment over the theft of her silver coffeepot, despite the fact that it caused a murder and an assault, both of which were glossed over by her as of little importance with the loss of her coffeepot of prime importance!But all in all, this was a fun book to listen to, as always, and I especially enjoyed the ending of this one and look forward to continuing with the next!"}, {"userName": "Terri Lynn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5699299-terri-lynn", "userReview": "If only I could give it a 10 plus!!! This is my favorite of all of the Detective Inspector Robert Colbeck mysteries by Edward Marston set in 1950's England. So finally (!!!!!) Robert proposes marriage to lady friend Madeleine Andrews after years of holding hands and exchanging kisses on the cheek. Hopefully they will not take 6 more books to get married. This book starts off with a train trip (of course) for a traveling troupe of actors. Nigel Buckmaster's (don't you just love the names Marston gives some of the characters?) is a fancy theater actor who heads the troop and thinks he is a gift to women. He has as his lady Kate Linnane who is as full of herself as she is gorgeous and talented. They share a first class carriage on the train with Hugh Kellow, a young silversmith sent by his boss to deliver an exquisite silver tea pot shaped as a train. Kellow's boss , Mr. Voke sees him off with many warnings to protect the teapot until it is delivered into the hands of the rich bitch who bought it- Mrs. Tomkins. Unfortunately, Colbeck and his assistant Sergeant Victor Leeming get called to Wales to investigate when Hugh Kellow is murdered in what appears to be a kinky sex act at the hotel at the train station. He is trussed up to the bed spread eagled with semen in his tightie whities and acid poured down his throat and over his face. The tea pot is stolen.Colbeck and Leeming love getting to work with their colleague and friend Jeremiah Stockdale who runs the police in Cardiff, Wales. This story is full of excitement and mystery and Cardiff, Wales is just the British version of Peyton Place! You would not want these people for friends nor to marry any of them. There are stolen carriages, Leeming is (as in every book) thumped on the back of the head by someone creeping up on him, an elegant lady who plays musical beds with rich guys, some creepy rich ladies, trustworthy servants, stolen keys, a suicide, dads and their disgruntled sons, secret weddings, a kidnapping that was just a gal running off to be alone with her brother, another brother and sister who are in love and living as man and wife, and lots of train trips. As always, Marston provides an authentic taste of Victorian Britain and detectives who solve serious crime without cars, cell phones, or computers. As always Leeming whines if he ever has to spend the night away from his wife Estelle (once the boss Superintendent Tallis told him to stop being so horny and acting like an animal in a previous book). I liked the part about the theater troupe because I love theater and watching Shakespeare acted out on stage. There is a love triangle among the actors as well. Highly recommended!"}, {"userName": "Graham Tapper", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5974776-graham-tapper", "userReview": "The Railway Detective, Inspector Colbeck, has a different challenge on his hands this time. The locomotive in question is an ornament and not an actual engine. In fact, it's a coffee pot! In the shape of a railway engine! Yes, I too am struggling to imagine how that would actually work. How would it stand? How would you hold it to pour from it?Nevertheless, despite the interesting questions raised, the story surrounds the delivery of the item to a buyer in Wales, from the workshop of the creator in London, and the murder of the courier. The item itself, of course, is also missing.Since the death and the theft both appear to have occurred in a hotel in Cardiff owned by the local railway company, that seems as good a reason as any to call upon Colbeck's expertise. He and the ever faithful Sergeant Lemming, are dispatched by Superintendent Tallis to solve the case.But, it turns out that it isn't as simple as it might seem. Not only are they not certain who they are dealing with but the villain is no simpleton and is keen to play the situation to maximum advantage, not the least being to play upon the intended purchaser of the item for every penny they can extract, using the prized coffee pot as a bargaining chip.But, of course, we know that Colbeck is no fool and, despite being mislead at every turn, he will eventually get his man, or woman, in more ways than one.Another hugely enjoyable page-turner from Marston. If only his books were easier to find. Now waiting on a copy of \"Railway To The Grave\"."}, {"userName": "Gerry", "userReviewDate": "Sep 13, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1525599-gerry", "userReview": "Inspector Robert Colbeck, along with his assistant, Sergeant Victor Leeming, embark on another case for the Railway Detective. And the tale proves to be just as riveting as the previous ones in this hugely enjoyable series.A silver locomotive coffee pot is made for a wealthy lady in Cardiff, although why anyone should want a coffee pot in the shape of a locomotive is beyond me, and the silversmith's assistant sets off to deliver it.However, murder is committed (at The Railway Hotel thus the Railway Detective's involvement) and Colbeck, Leeming plus Jeremiah Stockdale of the Cardiff police, are called in to investigate. Thus begins an investigation that leads mysteriously around South Wales and London with plenty of false trails along the way. Complicating the investigation are all the petty jealousies involved in Cardiff society and the theatre, for a leading actor had met the coffee pot carrier on his way to his destination and becomes an integral part of the case.But unsurprisingly Colbeck eventually triumphs and brings the culprit to justice, enjoying a little love interest of his own en route. There's never a dull moment in the Railway Detective books!"}, {"userName": "Clark Hallman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/12101662-clark-hallman", "userReview": "The Silver Locomotive Mystery by Edward Marston (2009) \u2013 This is the 6th book in the Railway Detective series by Edward Marston. A magnificent, and valuable, silver coffee-pot, modeled after a Firefly Class of 1840 steam locomotive, becomes the property of several thieves in and around the city of Cardiff (Wales) in 1855. Unfortunately, possession of the treasured silver locomotive coffee-pot seems to result in robbery, extortion, and/or murder. Inspector Robert Colbeck (The Railway Detective) and his partner, Sergeant Victor Leeming, are assigned to the case, which tests their detective skills, their physical strength and their determination to solve the case. As usual for books in this Railway Detective series, there are multiple suspects to investigate and very interesting characters that add to the reader\u2019s enjoyment. I liked this book and the other books in this British series very much. I really believe this book deserves a 4.5 rating instead of a 4."}, {"userName": "Peter", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5346172-peter", "userReview": "This is the sixth book in the Railway Detective mystery series set in Victorian Britain featuring Inspector Robert Colbeck and his partner Sergeant Victor Leeming. A young London silversmith is given the job of delivering a silver coffee pot in the shape of a train locomotive to Cardiff, to the wealthy customers who commissioned it. On the way there he meets the leading principals of an acting troupe. Shortly after arrival in Cardiff a body matching the young silversmith's description is found in a hotel bedroom despite apparently knowing know one in the city. As the silversmith travelled by train to Cardiff and his body was found in a Railway hotel Colbeck and Leeming are called in by the local constabulary to help solve this baffling and dastardly crime.During their enquiries they meet a varied group of suspects ranging from a pair of self-obsessed actors to the professional mistress of a local business magnate, each are generally well drawn. Each have a liking for silver but otherwise no apparent motive. However, the stand-out character is the opinionated and callous wife of the businessman who had initially commissioned the coffee-pot. As the case proceeds Colbeck and Leeming shuttle between London and Cardiff as endeavour to track down the killer and his female accomplice. There are several twists along the way but I still managed to work out the accomplice fairly quickly if not the main culprit. Set against the background of the country's burgeoning railway system there is enough information to be interesting but not so much as to overwhelm non-enthusiasts. The story is told at a good quick pace making it any easy read but still manages to be an enthralling whodunit. Despite being the sixth in the series this was the first that I've read and as such feel that it capable of standing on its own rather than relying too heavily on what went before. Something light but still substantial for a long train journey or flight."}, {"userName": "Naomi Mouland", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21110200-naomi-mouland", "userReview": "I love this series of books.

A self contained story in so much as each of the books deals with a separate case though as with all series that you haven't followed from the beginning/have read out of sequence you run the risk of missing out on the history between the characters. Though the sixth book in the series, the first I have read. How much impact this had on my enjoyment is debatable as I felt the author back-tracked just enough in that if nothing else I could at least hazard a guess as to previous events and the relationships between the characters.An easily identified felon, characters with wonderful names, a hint of romance - in other words arguably a standard cosy mystery.Better by far than the predictable plot, the characters who I found wooden or indeed the dialogue which I thought somewhat stilted, whilst oddly sanitised at times and with the tendency to over-describe, leaving little to the reader's imagination, it was the never-the-less overall good attention to period detail that made this book for me.

A man is horribly murdered in a railway hotel room and a priceless silver model of a train is stolen. The book is set in a rather sanitised 1854, England and Wales. The characters are rather thin, all the goodies decent, too decent, but the mystery mostly holds. The problem with this sort of book is how to keep the tension going. The main character, Railway Detective Robert Colbeck, is never in any danger. There are the false trails of course, and we have the puzzle of the murder and theft. The author has a go at upping the excitement with a ransome note for the silver train and the attempts to catch the murderer/thief through delivery of the ransome. This works to an extent. But I did want more Victoriana, the feel of the time; there were lots of train rides but no problems, hardly credible, there'd be breakdowns, halts in out of the way places etc. And I wanted richer characters too. A book to read on a beach or train - and leave it there."}, {"userName": "Damien G", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37139683-damien-g", "userReview": "I missed this one so know how the detective inspectors relationship develops.Once again it is a simple mystery which brings to light the early days of the railways.The inspector to the chagrin of his superior is getting fame at the expense of the police.It us a simple story and the loss of the silver trophy and murder of its maker is at the heart of this novel.All the charaters are well drawn and it is the poor sargeant who suffers the most as he hates traveling by rail.The theatre company is fun and allows us to see a Victorian entertainment as it was.A tale of murder, snobbery, and intrigue."}, {"userName": "John Murray", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10715326-john-murray", "userReview": "I normally read this series when I'm out of other books to read. Usually I find them wanting and this one is no exception... over-written but condescending at the same time. To my mind less is more; this level of verbose description leaves little for the mind to picture. A good example is the opening section; way over the top and all a bit too sugary.I presume it will proceed to a reasonable plot as the other books in this series have, but the repeat sections and over-characterisation may deter me before I get much further.Not so much of the railway in this one, and that was the previous book's plus point.
