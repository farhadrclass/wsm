I read very few memoirs, but felt I should read this one after recently reading a novel about the Rwanda genocide which made me realize of how little I knew of it. In this book, we are exposed to it head on, with excruciating honesty . So many people killed but what about those who escaped? This book focuses on the story of one family, about how two young girls ran from the murderers and endured horrible conditions in refugee camps. Clementine at six years old is sent by her parents from her home with her older sister Claire to family in hopes of remaining safe . But the men appear there too and they must run. The narrative alternates between her present as a teenager in an American school and moving from one refugee camp to another, from one country to another until the sisters are granted asylum along with Claire\u2019s husband and child. For me the format felt somewhat disjointed and the back and forth from present to past was confusing. However, it seems to illustrate how it was for her . \u201cOften still, my own life story feels fragmented, like beads unstrung. Each time I scoop up my memories, the assortment is slightly different. I worry that I\u2019ll forever be confused.\u201d \u201cMy past receded, grew washed- out, jumbled and distorted. I could no longer discern what was real and what was fake. Everything, including the present, seemed to be both too much and nothing at all. Time, once again, refused to move in an orderly fashion...\u201dThis is difficult to read as Clemantine struggles to find a way to heal and move forward. That involves moving back to what happened. This is an impactful telling, depicting the refugee experience in ways that we may not think about. It\u2019s easy to think how lucky they are, how lucky to be alive, giving not much thought perhaps to the trauma they have experienced, the displacement, the identity crises each one may experience, the loss of home and perhaps family.\u201cThe word genocide cannot tell you, cannot make you feel, the way I felt in Rwanda. The way I felt in Burundi. The way I wished to be invisible because I knew someone wanted me dead at a point in my life when I did not yet understand what death was...... \u201c I recommend you read this memoir to see the rest of what Clementine has written about genocide and see for yourself the strength that she embodies. I recommend it because while this is a story of this one person and her family, it provides much to think about - what happened in Rwanda and about what happened during the Holocaust and what is happening in places in the world today. I received an advanced copy of this book from Crown Publishing through NetGalley."}, {"userName": "Debbie", "userReviewDate": "May 07, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8665845-debbie", "userReview": "Socks officially knocked off!Best book I\u2019ve read this year, hands down, and it goes on my all-time favorites list. Intense, upsetting, sobering, this story got under my skin in a big way. I can\u2019t stop thinking about, I can\u2019t stop talking about it.One day Clementine is playing happily with her siblings in the yard of her comfy and loving home in Rwanda, the next day she and her 15-year-old sister Claire are running for their lives. Chapter 1 opens with this: \u201cWhen I was a regular child, I lived in Kigali, Rwanda, and I was a precocious snoop.\u201d A few pages later she says: \u201cMy days were filled with the indignations of being young and spoiled.\u201dAnd then the war started. Her parents started whispering, and they snapped at the kids. Their happy faces now showed only worry. Her brother told Clementine that the gunfire was thunder, and she had no reason not to believe him. But she did know her life was changing: \u201cYou know those little pellets you drop in water that expand into huge sponges? My life was the opposite. Everything shrunk.\u201dOnce she and her sister started their escape, she said: \u201cMy thoughts and senses became jumbled. Time felt hot. Silence was dizzying. My fear was bright blue.\u201d Stats: Their search for safety spanned six years and seven African countries. Just mind-boggling that they wandered so long and so far. They didn\u2019t walk the whole way; they went by bus and by boat sometimes. At the beginning of the book, there\u2019s a map. I must have stared at that thing 20 times. Yes, I became pretty obsessed with trying to imagine their journey, and I was incredulous that they had traveled so far. (I knew virtually nothing about which countries were where in Africa. Now I feel like I could not only name the countries in southeast Africa, but I could also put them on a map. This from a person who pretty much hates maps and confesses to being directionally impaired.) I kept trying to put myself in her shoes\u2014walking a gazillion miles in the heat, fighting for food so she wouldn\u2019t starve, living in deplorable refugee camps, surviving illness, seeing dead bodies and hearing the wounded moan. And she did all of this without the help and love of her parents or brother, whom she dearly missed. How does a kid survive such a thing? One of the images that sticks in my mind is Clementine pulling out bugs that had taken up residence in her feet. And there are many, many more images that made me shudder.The beauty of this book is that the author makes you see her journey through the eyes of her six-year-old na\u00efve self. Clementine wasn\u2019t able to comprehend exactly what was going on, and she didn\u2019t understand death. When she saw dead bodies in the water, she thought they were people sleeping. All she understood was that for some awful reason she had to run away from her family, and she was hungry, tired, scared, and homeless.Eventually she and her sister ended up in an alien universe: America. Imagine the culture shock! Not only did she end up in outer space, she ended up on the Oprah show! Kind, rich white people took her in and sent her to good schools. She was so blown away about her experience, so traumatized, she didn\u2019t know how to act. She said, \u201cI was whoever anybody wanted me to be.\u201d Her relationships with her family and friends are tough. She has two scars on her legs, which embarrass her. I\u2019m sure she has plenty of scars on her psyche. I\u2019m beyond impressed that she never acted like the victim, only like a survivor. Clementine is incredibly self-aware and is great at describing her psychology, which gets big points from me.This isn\u2019t just a journalist\u2019s report full of facts; Clementine infuses her story with lots of emotion. Every sentence grabbed me; I felt like I was right there. Every emotion was loud and real. This story ends well. Clementine graduated from Yale, she became a successful activist, she has a good, rich life. But still, her scary life as a young girl running away from her war-torn country will always be a huge part of her. She can never shake it off.The book alternates between her journey in America and her harrowing journey in Africa; I liked the format. For those who hate gore, don\u2019t worry\u2014there isn\u2019t any. Although what she went through is way worse than depressing, her story of survival is uplifting.One of those fun woo-woo moments: I had just added Austerlitz to my To-Reads when I ran across Clementine talking about the book, which had a profound effect on her. Love these universe synchs!Here is how this book seeped into my soul and took up residence. Look at what this book did to me!-Didn\u2019t want to break the spell by reading another book.-Not enjoying my new book; seems so frivolous in comparison.-Still thinking about the book, LOTS.-Peddling the book to everyone I know.-Had a nightmare, where there was a chemical cloud approaching and I was trying to prepare myself to die. (I hardly ever have nightmares, especially not end-of-the-world nightmares.) Look at what this book made me do!It made me go all multi-media! Colors, music, videos, and my hands on a drum. (Consider this the multi-media room in the Joy Jar): -Put a picture of colorful Rwanda baskets into my photo library.-Checked out Airbnb in Rwanda just to see houses. I wanted to imagine her life there.-Checked out images of Rwanda\u2019s beauteous hilly landscapes. (Defies my assumptions of how Africa looks.) -Urgently plan to watch \u201cHotel Rwanda\u201d again.-Memorized the map of southeast Africa. -Still referring to the map showing Clementine\u2019s route (wonder when I will stop, lol).-Watched the Oprah video three times; shared it twice. Probably not done the repeat.-Listened to African drum music.-Added Paul Simon\u2019s song \u201cDiamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes\u201d to my playlist for the car.-Watched Paul Simon\u2019s \u201cUnder African Skies\u201d video.-Played my conga drum (hadn\u2019t touched it in years).-Am writing lists like this.\u201cDiamonds on the Soles of Her Shoes,\u201d by Paul Simon, is currently my favorite song ever. It\u2019s on the album called Graceland that he created in the 1980s along with other songs with an Africa focus and rhythm. The album was made a good ten years before the genocide and it\u2019s all happy and bright. I couldn\u2019t help thinking that the girl with the diamond shoes could have been Clementine before the war--rich, happy, sassy. But instead of wearing those shiny, expensive shoes, in reality she had only bugs on the soles of her feet\u2014and they were feasting on her skin. Anyway, the song got under my skin and ended up being stuck in my head. I guess you could say that the book took the same route.I\u2019ve gone on way too long, but I just can\u2019t stop myself. This book made me think not just about her story, but about genocide. More than 800,000 people were killed in that massacre. How is it possible that human beings could do this to each other? Incomprehensible.I\u2019m in awe of this writer in every way possible. Not only is her journey phenomenal, her writing is beautiful. Kudos to her co-writer as well.Thanks to NetGalley for the advance copy."}, {"userName": "JanB ", "userReviewDate": "Apr 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/260116-janb", "userReview": "5++ starsI had plans for today but first I decided to sit and read for an hour. Many hours later, I closed the last page of this book. I simply could not put it down until I had read every word of this powerful memoir.Clemantine was born into a comfortable middle-class family in Rwanda. At age 6 she and her older sister were forced to flee the ethnic killings. She spent the next 6 years moving from country to country, from refugee camp to refugee camp. Life in the camps was living in filth, infestations with lice and burrowing larva, dysentery, constant hunger, lack of sanitation and proper nutrition\u2026.living a horror we cannot even begin to imagine.At the age of 12, due to her sister\u2019s resourcefulness, she immigrated to the U.S., living a life she could never have imagined. She ultimately graduated Yale University, has been a guest on the Oprah Winfrey show and now speaks and advocates for refugees and women around the world. But inside she remains broken, trying in her words \u201cto string all the beads in the right order, situate them in the right light \u2013 I can create a narrative of my life that looks beautiful to me and makes sense.\u201dThis book is her struggle to come to terms with all she endured: the separation from her parents at such a tender age, the loss of everything, the constant fear and hunger, the abysmal conditions in the refugee camps, and her struggle to integrate her experiences with her life in the U.S. I read an interview where she says her overriding mission is to share the idea that every single person on the planet has equal humanity. She herself has gone from feeling worthless, living in abject poverty, to living a life of privilege, but inside nothing about her has changed. She says she is every one of those people and so are we. After reading her book, I have to say she has succeeded in her mission. Nothing I can say could possibly do the book justice but I\u2019ll end this review with her thoughts on a couple of subjects that made me stop and take note (please remember this is from an uncorrected proof):Her thoughts on the word \u201cgenocide\u201d: \u201cI resent and revile it\u2026the word is tidy and efficient. It holds no true emotion\u2026it cannot do justice \u2013 it is not meant to do justice \u2013 to the thing it describes. It cannot describe how she felt knowing someone wanted her dead at an age when she didn\u2019t even understand death. It can\u2019t explain a child playing dead in a pool of his father\u2019s blood. The experience of a mother forever wailing on her knees. It cannot explain the never-ending pain, even if you live. You cannot bear witness with a single word\u201d.On forgiveness: The world said \u201cnever again\u201d after WWII yet turned their backs during the Rwandan atrocities. To those who say forgive and forget, she has poignant words on why that is impossible. \u201cIt\u2019s not enough \u2013 plans must be made on how to never repeat these crimes in the future. Our minds can be poisoned \u2013 poisoned so gradually that we don\u2019t even realize we\u2019ve become sick.\u201d I learned a lot about the root causes of the Rwandan killings and they are chillingly similar to the tactics of Nazi Germany. The author herself read and re-read Elie Wiesel's book, Night, which helped her begin to open up and speak.Publication date is April 24, 2018. Buy it, borrow it...whatever you do, read it! How can we even begin to understand if we don't expose ourselves to books such as these?** edited to add: the story is not a linear one and the author changes time periods abruptly with no warning. This has bothered some reviewers, but for me, I found the story so strong and compelling I was willing to overlook it. **I received a digital copy of the book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Diane S \u2614", "userReviewDate": "Apr 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4159922-diane-s", "userReview": "4.5 The genocide in Rawanda, another subject that I knew little about. I knew it happened, knew it was a terrible atrocity, saw bits and pieces on the news, but that's about the extent of my knowledge. Now after reading this memoir about a young girl who experienced this herself, I know more. Clemantine was only six when she and her older sister, Claire were told to run. They did and for a long six years they went from place to place, camp to camp, faced starvation, horrible and unsanitary camp conditions. Always fearing that her sister who refused to give up would leave her, finding her too much of a burden, but Claire never did. Not even when she marrys an aid eorker and has children of her own.After those long six years, both sisters, with husband and children in tow were given permission to enter the US. A land they had heard marvelous things about, but the Clemantine who was, is now a completely different person, her experiences have hardened her. She feels alone, not seen, not understood. And indeed how can those who have not suffered as she understand? \"This---Rwanda, my life---is a different, specific, personal tragedy, just as each of those horrors was a different, specific tragedy, and inside all those tidily labeled boxes are 6 million, or 1.7 million or 100,000 lives destroyed.You cannot line up atrocities, like a matching set.You cannot bear witness with a single word.\"This was said in a response to people making the comparisons of Rwanda to the Holocaust, the killing fields of Cambodia or the ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. It is true, we can be empathetic, we can try to understand but can we really, when we only read words, watch the movies? We can't, we can't feel what it is like to live through something like this, to feel the disconnection between a new life and what one has suffered. She makes her struggles perfectly clear, but she does move on though always questioning, always anslyzing how she feels, how she thinks. She and her sister forge different paths, their will be some victories, quests, steps taken, personal losses but she never stops trying.A moving, powerful story, a story about resilence and survival,but also about the toll taken on the human pysche after living through such horrific times.ARC from Edelweiss."}, {"userName": "Elyse", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/597461-elyse", "userReview": "\u201cThe word genocide cannot articulate the one-person experience\u2014the real experience of each of the millions it purports to describe.

The Girl Who Smiled Beads was a fitting complement to In the Shadow, and I experienced on a more visceral, individual level the pain, fear, sacrifice, and absolute terror experienced by Clemantine and her family. This book is easy to read due to the exceptional writing, and I found it hard to put down; however, at times, I had to in order to absorb the abject torment suffered by Clemantine and her sister, Claire, from fleeing practically barefoot across multiple African countries to digging bugs out of the soles of their feet. This is Clemantine\u2019s story, how she shares her anguish, horror, loss, and despair, and in turn, how she claims her individuality and begins to heal. This book is important, urgently so given what is happening in our world right this very minute, and raw and stunning at the same time.

If I had a hard copy of this book, I would send it to each and everyone of you. Books like this resonate once again how powerful the written word can be and how a raw and deeply moving narrative can reach not only our hearts, but leave imprints on our soul.  I did not understand the point of the word genocide then. I resent it and revile it now. The word is tidy and efficient. It holds no true emotion. It is impersonal when it needs to be intimate;cool and sterile when it needs to be gruesome. The word is hollow, true but disingenuous, a performance, the worst kind of lie.  It cannot do justice--- it is not meant to do justice--- to the thing it describes. The word genocide cannot tell you, cannot make you feel, the way I felt in Rwanda. The way I felt in Burundi. The way I wished to be invisible because someone wanted me dead at a point in my life when I did not yet understand what death was. This is a deeply moving account of one Rwandan family torn apart by that countries genocide. It is told to us through the eyes of many different emotions; all felt through the writing of Clemantine who relives her flight as a refugee throughout the African continent and as a young woman in the United States. My eyes have never cried so hard and so long. I have read many memoirs, but this one stands our for me the most because of its powerful attention to not shy away from the fact that for those of us in the West , we have not a !@$%& clue what it really feels like for Clemantine. I felt that wake-up call, that earth shaking challenge that I needed to receive this lesson.  To be a refugee was to be a victim--it was tautological. And not just a victim due to external forces like politics or war. You were a victim due to some inherent, irrevocable weakness in you. You were a victim because you were less worthy, less good, and less strong than all the non-victims of the world. Wow! Like a slap in the face or a hammer to the head, right? As an educator, I teach and have taught many students that have been suffered from trauma but never had it explained quite like Clemantine does in her book.  So much of Rwanda---so much of the world struggled with this. When you're traumatised, your sense of self, your individuality, is beaten up.Your skin color, your background,your pain, your hope, your gender, your faith is all defiled. Those essential pieces of yourself are stolen. You, as a person, are emptied and flattened, and that violence, that theft,keeps you from embodying a life that feels like your own. I really want others to read this book, it's so beautiful and heartfelt and honest! It's also difficult to get through because it is so painful and I felt anger and sadness and despair and then Clemantine said  We need to find a way to tolerate an intolerable truth. We need to acknowledge facts that are incompatible with a stable faith in humanity, incompatible even with any sane definition of God.Clemantine, you are a beautiful soul and courageous to put into words your very personal journey. The challenges that you, your sister, parents, and other family members have faced and continue to face. You're a true teacher.

I also needed a little more background to the war in order to understand what occurred at this time in Rwanda and maps of their journey would have been helpful as I spend a lot of time trying to trace their journey.and the book didn't deliver on this either for me.While I had the above concerns I still recommend this book and think it would work really well for book clubs as there is lots to discuss but probably best to purchase a paperback edition.

Inhumanity is not confined to a country, a person, an idea. It is endemic to what is human, that need to dominate, to feel in control, in power. The powerful prey on the week and the cycle continues as each level preys on the level considered to be weaker than they.The book is a portrayal of life on the run, a portrayal for struggling through a minute, an hour, a day when you have nothing, not food, not water, and not the love and care of a parent to guide and protect you. No one cares whether you live or die, whether you take another breath, whether you survive another day, or even have a morsel to feed your body. The only thing that bothered me was the way in which the story was told. It flipped back and forth and for me it took away the story. I am one who likes a story, tragic as it may be, to be linear. However, this was a story that could rip out your heart and make you pause as you look to your life and all his fortunate moments that made you happy, all those people who cared for you, so happy to be alive and treasured even if it be by only one person."}, {"userName": "Jennifer Blankfein", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8904243-jennifer-blankfein", "userReview": "The Nobel Peace Prize winning author and Holocaust survivor, Elie Weisel, appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show in 2006 where Oprah played clips from an interview they had done on site at Auschwitz. In addition, on the same episode, Oprah was recognizing fifty winners of a high school essay contest who had written about Elie Weisel\u2019s Night and its\u2019 current day relevance. Clemantine Wamariya was one of the winners and was called up on stage to talk with Oprah. Clemantine was a Rwandan refugee who, along with her older sister, was separated from her parents and feared they were dead. For many grueling years the girls trekked through Africa during the genocide, escaping murderers and rapists, living in refugee camps and unsafe places, battling lice, starving and sleeping outside, and ultimately, after being granted asylum, ending up in the Chicago area and started new lives. Clemantine has said that \u201cNight was the door that opened up the world for me. It made me feel not alone. Wiesel had words to express experiences I couldn\u2019t articulate. He shared thoughts and feelings that I was too ashamed to name.\u201d Thinking she was on the show for her essay, she was in the front row and Oprah started asking her some questions about her family. Clemantine and her sister had not seen their parents since 1994, and in 2005, one year prior to this Oprah Winfrey Show episode, had learned they were still alive. On this day, as a surprise, Oprah brought Clemantine\u2019s parents and younger siblings from Africa to Chicago and as a colossal surprise in an emotionally charged moment, she reunited them on stage. Go to Book Nation by Jen to see the video on my blog post.The visceral joy we see in the video is the joy of a six year old girl being returned to her parents, yet the relationships of the family members had become much more complex due to everyone\u2019s traumatic experiences of the past 12 years.The Girl Who Smiled Beads is Clemantine\u2019s personal story; a six year old\u2019s journey in war torn Africa, and coming of age as a teenager in the United States living with the demons of the past while searching for self worth and purpose in a country with unlimited opportunities and excess. Clemantine\u2019s story is just one of many who survived the genocide in Africa in the 1990s \u2013 so heartbreaking and also deeply hopeful. I am a huge fan of Clemantine\u2019s, her strength and will to honor her experiences, create and stand up for her own identity, and her commitment to finding joy.

Starting in April 1994 and for 100 days, ethnic Hutu extremists slaughtered 800,000 of the minority Tutsi community and other political opponents regardless of their ethnicity. The fight between the two was not new and it has continued for years. The Belgians colonized Rwanda after their invasion of German East Africa in 1916 during World War One. They sowed the belief in racial differences between the Hutu, Tutsi and Twa. They supported a pro-Tutsi rule, although only 15% of the population were Tutsi, with 84% Hutu and 1% Twa. In 1959 the Hutu revolted. The clash between the groups has unsettled the entire region causing mass movement of people, countless refugee camps, the disintegration of families, starvation, illness and death. In 1994 Clemantine, six years old, and her sister Claire of fifteen, began a six-year long trek without parents moving from camp to camp--living in Rwanda, Burundi, Zaire (present day Democratic Republic of Congo) Tanzania, Zambia, Malawi and South Africa before they were finally given asylum in America. Claire, then married but abused by her husband, had become a mother of three. The book does not stop with the sisters\u2019 arrival in America. Please glance at the book\u2019s title and note the last three words--The Girl Who Smiled Beads: A Story of War and What Comes After. What does come after? The experiences in Africa were horrendous, but the assimilation process in America and learning how to live with such a past were extremely difficult too. Although side by side during their African journey, Clementine\u2019s and Claire\u2019s experiences were not the same. Neither were they so in America. Clemantine came to a wealthy, privileged family in a well-to-do neighborhood outside Chicago (Kenilworth). Claire lived in a nearby suburb of Chicago (Edgewater) with her kids. When the sisters did finally meet up with their parents, was it even possible to rebuild a sense of family? Surviving the six years without a home, without a country, without a single possession to call one\u2019s own was just the beginning of Clemantine\u2019s path toward healing and self-discovery. What could she grab on to? Early memories. Memories of her mother and how they had been raised. Memories of the fables her nanny told her. The first five words of the title relate to Clementine\u2019s favorite fable when she was four. Throughout the telling, Clementine returns to this fable.Clemantine\u2019s journey is engaging and well told. You can read facts in a history book, but here we see how it is to live and experience them. The telling flips back and forth between the African journey and Clemantine\u2019s \u201cjourney\u201d in America. Both threads move chronologically forward in time. I did not find this hard to follow because every chapter is given a date, the year in which the events of the chapter take place. However, I do not see the merit or the need to flip back and forth between the two threads.I myself lived near the community where Clemantine came to live. I went to the same high school she went to. The author has extremely well captured life in the community and at the high school. Inherent expectations, obligations and way of being are shown. What is demanded, what is expected and existing hypocrisies too.The audiobook is extremely well narrated by Robin Miles. Both the events in Africa and those in the States are equally well intoned. She captures the voice of the the characters well. I have given the narration five stars. The final chapter is read by Clemantine. She reads very slowly and emotively. She is harder to understand, but this gives a good touch to the end of the book. She speaks of what her life experiences have taught her. She advises others to appreciate all that our five senses can give us. She returns to the fable told to her by her nanny. She explains what this fable teaches. It is very simple, but very good\u2014it is up to each of us to make something of our lives. What each of us chooses to make of our life is up to us, but we must cherish this opportunity and use it well. I think this is what she is saying.This book has two authors--Clemantine Wamariya and Elizabeth Weil. It is not explained who wrote what. It flashed through my mind that perhaps the latter is the ghostwriter? I wish this had been explained.Two other books about the Rwandan and Burundi genocides are We Wish to Inform You That Tomorrow We Will Be Killed with Our Families and Strength in What Remains: A Journey of Remembrance and Forgiveness. Both I gave four stars. Both are very good. More detailed historical information is provided in these than what is provided in Clemantine\u2019s book. A quick, concise summary is given in chapter 6, and that is enough. The aim of this book is different. This is a book about Clemantine\u2019s personal experiences, how she came to deal with these experiences and what she has learned from the ordeal."}, {"userName": "Resh (The Book Satchel)", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47153997-resh-the-book-satchel", "userReview": "I'd recommend this book in a heart beat."}, {"userName": "Ali Edwards", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/165962-ali-edwards", "userReview": "Back in 2014 I heard Clemantine speak in Washington DC at a summit on girls + women in Africa which was sponsored by the ONE Campaign and Google. The event itself and the stories presented were profoundly moving and educational. When I was offered an opportunity to receive an advance copy of this book I jumped at the chance to get to go deeper into Clemantine's story and I think this book is a must read. It's a hard, raw read and one that is super important for all of us as human beings. It's a complex story of her escape from the Rwandan massage as a child and eventual arrival in the United States as a refuge. It is also so much more than that story - she intimately shares the impact of that entire experience on the way she thinks about herself, the way she views the world, and the ways she has attempted to own her own story. It is a book about becoming.

It was about a beautiful, magical girl who roamed the earth, smiling beads, and it was her favorite story. How ironic that Clementine ended up roaming the world.The references to different books throughout the memoir is interesting. Clementine read many she could relate to: Night by Ellie Weisel, Sula by Toni Morrison, Infidel by Ayana Hirsi Ali, The Natural History of Destruction and Austerlitz by W.G. Sebald. Each of these books helped Clementine to feel she wasn't alone in her thoughts and heartaches. So many times as we read a book we can relate to the characters or the situation and feel a little bit better about ourselves and life. It is a comfort to know we are not alone and Clemantine felt the same. Someone finally understood.One of the most moving passages in the book is found on pages 94-95. It begins \"The word genocide cannot tell you how I felt\u2026\" Such a moving and heartbreaking excerpt. Her description has remained with me. (The passage was too long to write here.)I found this book extremely hard to read. The descriptions of Claire's and Clementine's living conditions are beyond my ability to comprehend or even imagine. No human being should be subjected to the circumstances these two girls lived through. This is a book that should be required reading in high school so we never forget what happened and it is never repeated. A 5 star book.Each stanza of the poem by Maya Angelou, \"Still I Rise\" was a mantra to Clementine. It is beautiful and fitting. Here is a portion that appears on page 213.Did you want to see me broken?Bowed head and lowered eyes?You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise."}, {"userName": "Katie.dorny", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29183570-katie-dorny", "userReview": "I am trying to read more non fiction now I\u2019m older to actually educate myself about the world and other people - and my god this one took me on a journey.Clemantine details her journey through the Rwandan genocide, her childhood in refugee camps and her life in America; alongside her internal struggle to find herself and piece her history back together with her new life.It was heartbreaking reading this, but I felt like I had been told truths that no one else would tell me.

Clementine had written an essay in response to Elie Wiesel\u2019s book \u201cNight\u201d on surviving the Holocaust, and was to receive recognition for such. They had no idea they were to be reunited with their parents, younger sibling and recent addition. Both had new lives in America. It was an awkward and short meeting. It was the start to the end of their story. The war that brought them here. They grew up, 9 years apart, in what could be deemed an upper middle class life. Somewhat privileged and doted upon. Claire, curious beyond politeness, would not take the easy answer for life\u2019s questions. Her nanny would placate her with symbolic stories and songs. These moments would later help her through the too many devastations of her life.  Things start to change. Like \u201clittle pellets you drop in water that expand into huge sponges.\" she laments \u201cMy life was the opposite. Everything shrunk.\u201d They sequester away in their home. School is stopped, the market no longer visited, days are cut short and boarded up inside. The noise outside increased, no stories could calm the unease culminating daily. Tense whispers of \u201cthem\u201d coming unsettled Clementine. Guests had always been looked forward to. At 6, so much did not make sense.  Then they fled. First, the girls were sent to their grandmother\u2019s home, but soon fled there, as well. Thus the exodus began. From pampered to refugee, malnourished, exposed, forsaken. Always on the run. 6 countries and years later, they arrive in America. Claire, now married with 2 children of her own, and Clementine. A host family welcomes them all. A new life awaits them.  But that\u2019s not before life in their first refugee camp. As dismal as you can imagine, Clementine tries to retain her identity when so much has been taken away. And the yoyo unwinds. From refugee camp day to day, to the fresh start, stateside. Chapters break the dread, one to the lesser other. The innocence of a child, surviving horrific circumstances to a savvy teen, creating her own. From one spot of solace chased into another. Learning as she went to allow nothing to give comfort, as tomorrow, it may be gone.  As much a story of perseverance as a book of theology. Wonderful tidbits of wisdom worthy of a bumper sticker or journal cover. I could fill this entire page with the words of wisdom gleamed, but with it being an ARC, they may not be there when you read it, so I abstain. My qualm was it was all in snippets. Synopses. Chapters that never got finished. While, in its own way, it was probably for the better, but there were things I wanted more of. Did she give out all her bracelets? How was her trip to Oprah\u2019s school? I wanted to feel more of her happiness. I wanted to know she was ok. The repetition of not knowing herself, hiding herself throughout life. Was she ever complete? A very evoking telling of the horrors suffered by a very little girl in a very big war. God Bless you, Clementine.

For some of these experiences there are no words, they are so horrific and profound. At six years old, she and her fifteen year old sister, Claire, fled the Rwandan massacre and spent the next seven years on their own searching for safety through seven African countries. This book puts a human story on those facts and figures we read about, when we see stories and photos about detention camps, refugees and immigrants who are fleeing horrific crimes against humanity. And although her story has a \"happy ending\", in that Clemantine ends up in America with a wonderful education, she can never fill the emptiness inside of her. This is really driven home by her description of an appearance on The Oprah Winfrey show, after her arrival in America, when Oprah surprises her and her sister by having her parents and siblings on the show. The hollowness and questions that are evoked within her, after not seeing her parents for all those years, set the stage for the telling of the rest of her story. The novel toggles back and forth in time, but somehow this structuring of the story works very well.This is, above all, a very honest memoir. Her emotions ring true as she struggles to explain why she feels a certain way, why she behaves the way she does. She is searching for answers for herself, and along the way provides insights for the reader. \"That's all a person can do, really: Let others live their lives on their terms, and interrogate how you live your own. Insist on knowing the backstory to your gifts and your pain. Ask yourself how you came to have all the things you carry: your privilege, your philosophy, your nightmares, your faith, your sense of order and peace in the world\".I highly recommend this book, it brought tears to my eyes at the end.

This provided a constant contrast between the harrowing times escaping war and her privileged life in America. And this was achieved without needing to be detailed but through the format of the book, which I thought was very effective.\u201cHow could one place have such excess while in another, just a plane ride away, people starved?\u201dI say \u201cprivileged life in America\u201d but that\u2019s not to imply that Wamariya\u2019s life became easy; yes, she may have left the conflict behind, but her memories travelled with her. I will not recount Wamariya\u2019s experience, but know that this is a painfully honest account. To read first-hand her experience of fleeing the Rwandan massacre and her journey to healing is eye-opening and emotional. What really stood out for me, and why I keep mentioning the honestness of this account, is that Wamariya lays bare to us her inner thoughts, her exploration of self, of losing who she was and trying to find herself again in every new country she enters.One thing this book highlighted for me was the state of refugee camps, in terms of their horrendous conditions. Now, this may be naive of me, but I did not expect the conditions to be so dire; aid was offered by charities, but it seemed barely any aid was being delivered. It\u2019s reading things like this in a book that open my eyes to things I was blind to before.\u201cAll those countries that ended WWII by saying never again turned their backs.\u201dA further thing this book highlighted for me, and shows the power of Wamariya\u2019s account, is when she speaks about the word genocide. I have always thought of it to be a powerful word, one indicating true horror \u2013 the worst man-made atrocity. Wamariya very clearly explained why this word is not enough, how this generalised conflict all over the world, when no two conflicts are the same, and no two people experience the same conflict in the same way. This is the importance of this book [and books like this] you are able to learn the individual experience and even that in itself is a start to recognising the individual \u2013 the individual pain, the individual loss, the individual healing.\u201cYou cannot bear witness with a single word.\u201dI highly recommend this book \u2013 a memoir of how the Rwandan massacre changed the life of a six-year-old girl forever \u2013 I thank Wamariya for sharing her account with us."}, {"userName": "Stephanie Jane (Literary Flits)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/31264299-stephanie-jane-literary-flits", "userReview": "See more of my book reviews on my blog, Literary FlitsThe Girl Who Smiled Beads was an unusual memoir for me to appreciate because much of the horrific genocide that forced Wamariya's exile happens off the page. Normally this would irritate me no end, but in this case it is because Wamariya's extreme youth meant she had a very limited understanding of what was happening around her. Instead of recounting violence and the details of this conflict, we see the Rwandan war as she saw it - in colours and sounds, through food or hunger - and this I often found emotionally more difficult to read. I was forced to keep remembering that this is the story of a young child. Wamariya intersperses her memories of her years spent rootless except for her sister, with thoughtful discussions of what it means to be a refugee. Many of the issues she highlights are not often discussed elsewhere and I found myself rethinking some of my own beliefs about the 'best' and most effective ways to offer help. The Girl Who Smiled Beads is a relatively fast read although one where I found it useful to re-read certain sections and discussions in order to really understand the points Wamariya makes. This book doesn't have the gruesome scenes that I found so distressing in The Running Man so I thought it more likely to appeal to a wider audience. It is still a shocking reminder of a terrible war and a strong warning of how the aftermath of colonialism still resounds across recently independent nations."}, {"userName": "Savannah Garner", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40005553-savannah-garner", "userReview": "2.5 stars.First I would like to thank Crown Publishing for providing me a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.

I cannot stop thinking about it.As a teenager I vaguely remember details about Rwanda and the genocide from the news. Whilst 6 year old Clemantine and her 15 year old sister Claire were walking across a continent, fleeing for their lives, living in unbearable conditions, I was just a couple of years younger than Claire; learning about the Holocaust in my history lessons, completely unaware of what was happening right at that moment to girls my age (and much younger) across the equator. There aren\u2019t really any sufficient words to describe that injustice.To me, the most important aspect of this book is it being a woman telling her own story, choosing what to include and how to relay her experiences, to be the narrative of her own memories. Too many times it is the women\u2019s voices in these situations that aren\u2019t heard, often erased or silenced. Not in this book. There are aspects of her story that Clemantine Wamariya clearly did not want to relay in minute detail and are subtly hinted at or glossed over. Throughout her time in various refugee camps and whilst displaced, Clemantine states she felt invisible, forgotten and exposed, these are her experiences laid bare, as true as she can remember, and she gets to make all of the decisions.The timeline of the book swaps between her younger years as a refugee and her transition from adolescence to adulthood after settling in America. I found this differing narrative helped to dissipate the overwhelming horror of her time in Africa but also to show how the events of her past had a causal link to everything she experienced as she adjusted to her new life. She states her memories were not always there until prompted sometime later and by structuring the book in this jumbled way you see how things appear connected but unbalanced as Clemantine struggles to adjust and take stock of her experiences.I loved reading about her determination to get an education (and her successful application to Yale), her discovery of the power of yoga, but most of all her love of works by Toni Morrison, Audre Lord, Elie Wiesel, Maya Angelou, W.G. Sebald etc that she credits in the acknowledgements for \u201ccreating many paths to find my own beat\u201d. I\u2019m sure this book will be a similar gift to many.This book offers such an insight, such a lesson in the human cost of conflict, particularly for children. This is a story that is sadly not unique, it is repeated throughout history, throughout the world, and is happening right now, in Syria, in Myanmar, in Yemen. It is easy to see the despair and long-lasting effects that such a brutal experience has on Clemantine and those around her, but there\u2019s also the strength, determination, sincere acts of kindness (often by women, and women who had very little to give but gave anyway), and pure grit of two women who refused to become nameless or be defined by tragedy.A story everyone should read; it is one of those books that allows the author to speak their truth, that allows us in turn to better ourselves.

To this day I do not know how to respond and be polite. No, I want to scream, it's not like the Holocaust. Or the killing fields in Cambodia. Or ethnic cleansing in Bosnia. There's no catchall term that proves you understand. There's no label to peel and stick that absolves you, shows you've done your duty, you've completed the moral project of remembering. This - Rwanda, my life - is different, specific, personal tragedy, just as each of those horrors was a different, specific, personal tragedy and inside all those tidily tabled boxes are 6 million, or 1.7 million or 100,000 or 100 billion lives destroyed. You cannot line up the atrocities like a matching set. You cannot bear witness with a single word. \nThis book is a must read, in my option. It tells you a part of history in such a honest and real way, takes you to the nice days before the bad days started, takes you through the horrible life of having to leave everything -your family, home and everything that gives you comfort- behind in seconds, and leaving you with the only human instinct: Survival. This book takes you on a journey. Its not necessarily a good one, but an important one none the less. Its not a good one because its so honest. It really talks about the good, the bad and everything in between that humanity has to offer. It shows us that even those that try to help can sometimes to a lot of harm. Be it with words or actions or expectations. No matter how much good intention they have or how well they are meaning it, this book really shows us that if you haven't lived it, you don't understand. And thats not a bad thing! Everyones story is unique (which the book also clearly stats and its so TRUE! and i loved that it was so focused on saying \"this is my story, this is just one story of what happened in Rwanda, not THE story!\") and while some people might better understand what others go through or survived through... nobody really understand if you where there. And even if you where there, lived through the same, its still your own unique story. In the book itself Clemantine talks about her experience and later on mentions that her sister always tells the same story differently. So even thought both of them lived through the same days, through the same events, they remember it completely differently. And that i just how life is. Which might sound depressing, but i think that is what makes us all so unique and that is what we all have to remember. Everyone has a story to tell, and especially those that survived through horrendous humanity caused tragedies have to tell theirs, to remind everyone what is at stake, what could be happening, what has happened and that we all have to work together to not let it happen again or let it continue. READ THIS BOOK. And be swapped away into a horrendous, tragic, beautiful life story that makes you think, makes you connect and understand while also starting to question things.

Fantastic."}], "description": "A riveting story of dislocation, survival, and the power of stories to break or save us.Clemantine Wamariya was six years old when her mother and father began to speak in whispers, when neighbors began to disappear, and when she heard the loud, ugly sounds her brother said were \"thunder.\" In 1994, she and her fifteen-year-old sister, Claire, fled the Rwandan massacre and spent the next six years wandering through seven African countries, searching for safety--perpetually hungry, imprisoned and abused, enduring and escaping refugee camps, finding unexpected kindness, witnessing inhuman cruelty. They did not know whether their parents were dead or alive.When Clemantine was twelve, she and her sister were granted asylum in the United States, where she embarked on another journey--to excavate her past and, after years of being made to feel less than human, claim her individuality.Raw, urgent, and bracingly original, The Girl Who Smiled Beads captures the true costs and aftershocks of war: what is forever destroyed; what can be repaired; the fragility of memory; the disorientation that comes of other people seeing you only as broken--thinking you need, and want, to be saved. But it is about more than the brutality of war. It is about owning your experiences, about the life we create: intricately detailed, painful, beautiful, a work in progress.", "title": "The Girl Who Smiled Beads: A Story of War and What Comes After", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36076501-the-girl-who-smiled-beads", "average": 4.21, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1513785011l/36076501.jpg", "reviews": 394, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/17112790.Clemantine_Wamariya", "name": "Clemantine Wamariya"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/427010.Elizabeth_Weil", "name": "Elizabeth Weil"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Autobiography", "Cultural", "Biography"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36076501-the-girl-who-smiled-beads", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36086537-the-girl-who-smiled-beads", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36332717-the-girl-who-smiled-beads", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39571496-the-girl-who-smiled-beads"]}
