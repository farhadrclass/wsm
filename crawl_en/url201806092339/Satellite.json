So I settled down to read it..... And to my instant horror discovered it was a book laden with text-speak and with little to no correct capitalisation. An absolute no-no in my books. A transcript of the irritating writing style found on page one:i don't move. soon, we're over the coast of Africa. sketches of towns. u don't c them so well in the daytime, which means that they almost extinguish in front of my eyes, the tracery of light blinking off as the wall of sun advances.then sea.it's always the sea.people down there call their planet the earth, but it's mostly water. i know every fifth grader knows that. it's just, when u're in orbit, it's really obvious. sometimes Grandpa vidlinks me from down there & he asks me where we are & i don't even look out a porthole, i just say over the ocean & ususly i'm right.As if the style wasn't irritating enough it reads in such a clunky and awkward fashion. Certainly no purple prose here. I flicked through a few more pages in case this horrific styling would end after a page or two... Alas, all I saw were more examples of this *literary text-speak style* and therefore I chose not to continue with this read. I must thank my lucky stars that this was only a library loan and not something I had paid money for as otherwise I would have been utterly dismayed.

But something about Satellite just said read me, read me and so, naturally, I obliged and I'm so glad that I did. This book was so raw and emotional and sort of made me want to go into space (although I'm sure it would make me puke my guts up, so maybe just one of those 0g chambers...), and Leo was just such a perfect character.space is the wrong word, because this is something that goes on forever & is full of worlds, billions of them, pinpricks sparkling in the endless darkness. Leo and Orion and Libra were born in space. More specifically, aboard Moon 2, a space station owned and maintained by the vaguely and a little ominously named corporation, The Company. Space is all these three children have ever known, but now it's almost time for them to voyage to earth. The scientists that monitor them reckon that sixteen is old enough for the force of re-entry not to harm Leo and the twins, for their delicate space-born bones not to shatter on impact, and these children cannot wait to finally walk, to sleep without being strapped down, but they are also a little wary of leaving the only place they have ever known: the infinite, cold, dark entity that is space.The plot is unlike anything I have ever read but what really makes this novel is the characters. Our three central characters are all distinct: Orion is a music-lover, a devourer of poetry; Libra is green-fingered, an aspiring botanist and a thoughtful girl; Leo is a dreamer, a thinker, a boy whose mother, an astronaut, barely speaks to him, and who wants nothing more than to go and live on the ranch of his grandfather, an ex-astronaut and a wonderful character in his own right. Leo is our sole narrator, concerned with mathematics and engineering and all things to do with space, he's got an unvoiced crush on Orion and a desire to see mountains and to breathe fresh air and to know what it is like to live with gravity weighing you down.flight: the noun for flying & the noun for fleeingwe flee the earth & my heart pounds with the joy of it. what's wrong with me? all i ever wanted was this place. the ranch. the feeling of the ground beneath my feet.but when we take off, into the sky, my body sings with it This story in uniquely Leo's, the world and it's conspiracies seen only through his eyes (perhaps sometimes to the frustration of the reader who might like to know more about what dwells in the shadows of The Company), so it makes sense that the style of the book is different. It's all in text speak. This surprised me and was a bit offputting when I first started reading Satellite; I don't think there's a single capitalised \"i\", and it's always \"c\" instead of \"see\" and \"u\" for \"you\". It was a touch odd and I suppose it was meant to reflect the modernity, the youth of the narrator, his strangeness from Earth and yet his connection to it. But once I got into the book, I felt that what the writing really did was ground you in Leo's experience, immerse you in his world. But if you well and truly hate text-speak, I would probably recommend that you avoid this particular book!I adored Satellite. I thought the writing itself was beautiful, philosophical, and deliciously quotable, the main characters and particularly Leo were delightful and felt like real people, and that the plot had the right mix of action, space-related things, wonder, suspense, conspiracies, and drama. All in all, an excellent novel.My thanks to Netgalley, the publisher, and the author for an ARC of Satellite.

I want to read it so bad, but I can't read \"text-speak\".I'm only 22 and haven't used text-speak since middle school. I have no idea why adults use it in books, so I really don't know how so many people were ok with publishing a book in nothing but text speak. I understand it's supposed to give the feeling of transcripts, but considering how rare text-speak is in the year 2017 I highly doubt it's going to be all a 16-year-old knows to use in the future. Which is another reason why I can't read it- the main character is 16 and I keep reading his story as though he's 12. So to everyone who has any say with this book, please put out an audiobook.

On the one hand, the story is good and held my interest: three teens born and raised in zero G on a space station come down to Earth and experience things like gravity, getting sick, being outside, etc. for the first time. It's a great fish-out-of-water story and I'm a sucker for fish-out-of-water stories. There's just one problem: the whole thing is written in textspeak. Seriously, the whole thing. There's no \"see\" or \"you\" just \"c\" and \"u\" and \"ppl\" and \"dr.ate\" instead of \"doctorate\" and I is never once capitalized. It's annoying and distracting and every time I'd see it, my eye would twitch. I spent this whole book in a state of constant eye-twitching. But! The story is still pretty cool - it's five minutes into the future, there's no more NASA, it's now privately owned by a mysterious group referred to only as \"The Company\" (who seem pretty damn shady) which owns the space station, Moon 2, where these kids grew up. This company invested billions of dollars in these kids and yet did not bother to teach them proper grammar...? Again, if you're not able to take a breath and look past the textspeak, you might not make it all the way through this book, which would be a shame, as, again, it's got a good story featuring a protagonist of color and some strong, well-handled LGBTQ themes. Leo (our protagonist)'s first person narration does limit the scope of the story - we get all sorts of hints about something bigger going on outside the kids' world, including conspiracy theories and a major media scandal, but we never really get to see it as The Company keeps the kids pretty tightly in their control. It would've been nice to introduce a second perspective, perhaps from someone within the company, or Leo's mom or grandfather, but since this is Leo's story, you get to take everything in from his eyes.In goddamned textspeak. Ugh.Still, this book is worth it despite the textspeak. Though if it were up to me, I would have gotten my editor pen and taken all of that out. It's annoying. But if you can look past the writing (which is pretty hard, since this is a book) Satellite has a really good story behind it. It's got space adventures! I'm a sucker for space adventures. Good thing I read a kindle edition of this book, if I had gotten a paper copy, I would've gone nuts with my red editing pen."}, {"userName": "Sian Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Oct 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2449303-sian-thomas", "userReview": "PLOTCan home be a place you\u2019ve never even been? A place you can\u2019t even truly understand or even imagine. But once you\u2019re back there, is it really home?Leo has lived all his life on Moon 2, a space station orbiting the earth, with his sibling-friends, twins Libra and Orion. They were born there, apparently by accident, to mothers who were working in orbit at the time, and being children, are deemed not strong enough to return home to earth until their 16th birthdays which are rapidly approaching as we enter the story.Written from Leo\u2019s perspective, it\u2019s a fascinating look at being a true outcast, having very little human contact and absolutely no experience of everything that we know. We follow him on his journey from 0g to the gravity of earth, into quarantine and to his grandfather\u2019s ranch. The struggles of him trying to understand how to physically and mentally exist in a world he doesn\u2019t recognise as home.MY THOUGHTSI\u2019ll address the obvious first; the thing that everyone\u2019s pointing out and is meaning this book is being left unfinished by some: the text speak. \u201cU\u201d is used instead of \u201cyou\u201d, \u201cc\u201d instead \u201csee\u201d, and numerical digits instead of the number written out as a word.As a self-proclaimed grammar stickler (I\u2019ve even got the T shirt), this bothered me at first. A lot. I thought it was because it was YA and written that way to try to fit in with that genre, even though I\u2019m not entirely sure teens even use text speak any more (why bother when we no longer have to use the multi-tap method of typing?). Then I discovered it was because Leo is in space and astronauts write that way in order to convey a message more quickly \u2013 every second counts in space \u2013 and it made sense. From then on, it still bothered me a little but I eventually stopped seeing it. It seemed to bother me most in dialogue though as it made statements seem more casual and abrupt when that character actually wasn\u2019t really that way, but that\u2019s really the only issue I had with it in the later parts of the book.Moving past that though, the rest of the writing was wonderful. Descriptions that can only be described as luxurious; perceptions of earth, of \u201chome\u201d, as being a completely new experience. The only experiences Leo and his friends have of earth is those in books, films, TV shows and what the Company chooses for them to see.After finishing the book, I found myself actually thinking hard about the sensations described that I normally take for granted: gravity dragging me down to the ground; the feeling of a mattress pushing back up against me, the duvet weighing me down; scents in the moving air; the sound of birds wings; and tastes. All the tastes. The way that all of these things and more became so real for me that I was appreciating things I never would have thought twice about before.The wider world the book is set in is fantastic. We\u2019re in the near future, on a struggling earth, which is only made apparent through dropped hints and accidentally let-on secrets. NASA has been privatised, the Company (as they\u2019re unsettlingly referred to) alone holds the monopoly on space. But the world is a different place to the one we know. Men are casually referred to as wearing mascara and nail polish. It\u2019s stated as part of character-building occasionally, and as it\u2019s all from Leo\u2019s perspective, we see that this is not a big deal. Masculinity is being worn down. This is even more apparent thanks to Leo\u2019s attraction to men rather than women, and the way that it\u2019s so fleetingly referred to, like the make up, as if it\u2019s the most natural thing, rather than being made a big deal of as so many YA novels might do. This was brilliant and I\u2019d love to see more of it.To be completely honest, I went into this book not really expecting not to like it all that much. Yes, it\u2019s YA and it fits one of my favourite genres of isolated landscapes, but I thought it was going to be childish and stereotypical YA-y based \u2013 I have to stop thinking this because apparently I like that stereotype! There wasn\u2019t an overload of romance like I was expecting (in fact, there was barely any aside from the occasional attraction) and it went much deeper than I expected. I honestly loved it. It was described as The Martian for teens in the description which drew me (as I loved The Martian) so I should have believed that!The only thing that could have made the book better was if we got to see more of the world that\u2019s been created around the story, but I understand that seeing it through Leo\u2019s eyes, there\u2019s only so much we could be shown. I\u2019d be happy to read more books set in this landscape.I really hope this book gets the attention it deserves. I can honestly see it being made into a film \u2013 it has space, it has adventure, it has emotion, and it has a really good story line. In fact, it felt like watching a film while reading it.

So this isn't a promotion or part of a campaign; the only campaign it's a part of is me on a one woman mission to get all of you to read Satellite.On the inside cover, it's advertised as The Martian for teenagers, and while I haven't read The Martian, that didn't fill me with much hope that I was going to like it. Moreover, you open the page and see that the prose is written more in text speak (which is, apparently, the way they message each other in NASA but don't quote me on that). I saw a lot of people complaining about that and why they couldn't read the book because of it, some even giving it two stars\u00a0just because of that! But literally after the first two pages, I got used to it. If you've ever been a teenager, you've probably texted like that. I used to read whole MSN conversations written in that format. It took a moment, but fourteen year old Hollie sprang to life and got that hang of it pretty quickly. So, if you start reading Satellite and are at first put off by the text, keep going! Otherwise you're gonna miss out on an incredible story about a boy who's finally gonna be discovering Earth after being born and living on a space station all his life.The world in Satellite is not like our own, but I strongly feel that it is something we are progressing and also hurtling dangerously towards. The way in which Nick Lake has written this society is so realistic and a world that we could find ourselves in pretty soon; the good and the bad. Firstly, as good progression, society has moved to dismantle gender norms and roles. I think we're already on that glorious road, but we are nowhere near the complete abandonment of it, and that's not the case either in Satellite. But in this society, clothes, makeup, hairstyles etc are less gendered, so it was great to see a 'futuristic' society that relates more to our future. This was just one aspect of why I loved this novel, but it was definitely one I couldn't ignore in my review. There are, of course, downsides to looking at society in the future; things that are dooming out planet. But I'm not going to talk about those because I don't want spoil the story!Above all, Satellite is about Leo discovering what home means to him. He's a kid in extremely unique situation, with experiences that are nothing like anything on Earth (literally), and it was sad and funny and above all, really beautiful to read. I don't think I ever saw anyone talking about it until I started to when it came through the post box.

It drove me crazy at first and took me a long while to even understand what was going on. But, it really makes the book unique!After i was able to c past that, then i really started to enjoy the book. (c how crazy that can make u?)The book revolves around Leo and the twins, Orion & Libra. They have lived on Moon 2 for their whole life but now they are ready to go \"home\", as in Earth. The writer is very good at describing the space station that they lived on as well as their thoughts while first being on Earth. He was also able to remarkable at more diversity within the book with an autistic character as well as different racial characters. I was also pleasantly surprised by the LGBT elements that had shown up, I was not expecting that. There are several emergency scenarios which could make this book unputdownable.

They were born in space, on the Moon 2 Space Station. They\u2019ve never had to walk with gravity and they aren\u2019t deemed strong enough to go back to Earth until they are 16 years old. However, when they make it to Earth, there are unexpected consequences to their arrival.Satellite is a book that I think will be either a hit or miss to a lot of people depending on how they take to the writing style. It is written in text speak, narrated by Leo. There is no capital letters, little punctuation, and abbreviated words. I\u2019m not sure on why this type of writing style was chosen, perhaps to highlight Leo\u2019s youth and perhaps his distance and unfamiliarity to Earth?I do have to say though, I am slightly disappointed in this read. I was expecting a science fiction read full of thrilling survivalist scenes in space. I was expecting something like The Martian for teens, a \u2018 highly original space thriller\u2019. Satellite had a promising opening full of science and intense scenes. However, after about the 20% mark, they made their way to Earth, and then the action stopped and the pacing lagged. Little happened and the mystery and \u2018conspiracy\u2019 was hardly there and I guessed it from the get-go.The characters were a highlight of this book. Leo is a dreamer and a thinker. He wants nothing more than to follow in his mother\u2019s footsteps to be an astronaut. Libra is an aspiring botanist, who longed for the day she could step onto Earth and tend to her own garden. Orion was a favourite; a music and poetry lover. I do really wish we saw more of their relationship and friendship though. Also, it was never stated on-page, but Leo is gay and showed romantic interest in Orion.Overall, definitely not a bad book just not the book for me. I loved the science, and loved the premise, was fond of the characters but wasn\u2019t overly fond of the pacing or the plot of the book.

However, I have read very few books that take place in outer space, so when I requested this book, I was so excited to read about characters who come from another part of the universe! For the most part, I am quite happy to say that I really enjoyed my time reading\u00a0Satellite.For a brief summary of the novel, it revolves around a teenage boy named Leo, who has spent his whole life living on a space station called Moon 2. Since Leo and two of his friends have reached the age and strength they'd need to take a trip to Planet Earth, they are all for it, taking numerous drills to prepare themselves. Will survival come easily to them while on Earth, or will they have to work extra hard to keep up with their lives?I liked the brave and determined main character Leo and his space gang, and I loved the adventures that they went on, how they found themselves, and how they improved their relationships with each other throughout these journeys. The amount of character development in this novel was phenomenal, and I was extremely thankful to have witnessed it.In spite of these characters,\u00a0the book was written using mostly lowercase letters and texting language, and this took me a little while to get used to- it could get somewhat annoying. The plot also went by quite slowly, leaving me a tad bored at times. However,\u00a0the story overall had quite an interesting, fun, and captivating plot.All in all,\u00a0Satellite\u00a0is that novel about space that you didn't know you were even looking for. There is no denying that it is flawed in some respects, but the irresistible bonds between the characters and the intriguing premise will definitely have you on your feet, cheering for Leo and his crew and wondering what it would be like to live on the extraterrestrial Moon 2!*I received an advanced reader copy of this book from Indigo Books & Music Inc. in exchange for an honest review.*"}, {"userName": "Karen Barber", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38841409-karen-barber", "userReview": "Thank you NetGalley. Satellite is one of those reads that had some wonderful moments but which also left me feeling rather flat. A tough one to review, and this will be one that I think splits views.In this novel Lake focuses us on Leo, a young boy born in space who is desperate to \u2018go home\u2019, to earth. It\u2019s a journey he and his two companions, Libra and Orion, have been looking forward to for as long as they can remember. Our story is split into distinct parts. We watch the teens in space, planning their lives on earth. We see them journey to earth and look at their experiences. Then, perhaps most oddly, we return from whence we came.Leo\u2019s voice is distinctive. Overcoming the annoyance of the writing style will be a big factor in your response to the story. However, if you can look beneath this you\u2019ll probably find yourself quite taken with these kids.As we learn more about Leo\u2019s family, and get a sense of just where he\u2019s come from, it\u2019s hard not to fall a little under his spell. Seeing the experience of life on earth from the view of someone who\u2019s not physically prepared for it is intriguing. Watching the relationships Leo has develop is pretty compelling.Unfortunately, much as I liked Leo and grew to care for him I felt the latter stages of the novel took us so far into the realms of incredibility that I really didn\u2019t enjoy it as I\u2019d hoped to."}, {"userName": "Elliot Reinking", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/72096106-elliot-reinking", "userReview": "I read Satellite for a school project and did not realize how good of a book it is. This dramatic story, mixed with action, adventure, and laughs, with keep readers on the edge of their seats. It is about 3 kids who are born in space. It settles in, late into the future, where water on earth is running out. While doing experiments, a cargo ship crashes into the space station they are living on, causing them to fly down to Earth. Will gravity affect them too much, or will the teens live a normal life? Read the book to find out!

He's spent almost sixteen years exclusively on Moon 2, a space station that orbits the planet. Born on Moon 2, Leo and twins Orion and Libra, were told they had to wait until their bodies were deemed strong enough to return to Earth. And that day has finally come. Leo looks forward to everything. Gravity, air on his face, the sun... And though Earth has always been referred to as home, it's not a place Leo, Orion, or Libra has ever belonged to. From the start, their trip isn't what they expected and now they have to try to navigate - and survive - against impossible odds. Nick Lake's latest is a bit like The Martian for teens. A bit.We meet Leo and the others just shy of Leo's 16th birthday. He and the twins have been raised on a space station. All three were born there, unplanned, and unable to return unless and until their bodies are strong enough. And because of the effects of space travel on the body, they each only see their mothers for brief periods. So they've been raised by a rotating staff of Moon 2 scientists.Leo loves space. He wants to be an astronaut. But he does want to see and experience Earth as well. So his trip home is one that he's been anticipating for quite some time. And yet, it's understandable that when he arrives the reality of this planet is not what he expected.What's more, there are hints throughout that maybe life on Earth isn't all that great at the moment.Set in the near future, Earth is experiencing drought and other problems. Nasa has been privatized and enveloped within a larger company. And then of course there's the fact that even though Leo and the others have trained for their Earth trip, they've never even faced gravity before much less everything else the planet has to throw at them.Satellite takes a bit of getting used to. Leo narrates and his voice is clear from the beginning, including his penchant for not using capitalization and speaking almost Twitter like rather than fully spelling out everything. It's jarring at first, but I found I was quickly sucked in. And once I was, boy was Satellite fun!There are elements that reminded me a lot of The Martian, but there were elements too that reminded me a bit of Jonathan Maberry's Mars One as well. I mean, they're all set in space... but Satellite definitely stands on its own and makes for a fantastic sci fi read. Sci fi for a non sci fi reader, as the book's actual editor puts it. And it's absolutely appropriate!"}, {"userName": "Ashvin", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42672855-ashvin", "userReview": "(ARC Review) Satellite by Nick LakeDisclaimer: I received this ARC published by Hodder Children\u2019s Books courtesy of Pansing Malaysia in exchange for my honest review.Satellite by Nick Lake, deemed \u2018The Martian\u2019 for teens, is a story about Leo, a teenage boy born in space (Moon 2), that\u2019s about to make his first trip to Earth, his first trip to home. Alongside Leo on this journey are Orion and Libra, all three who are finally old and strong enough to endure the dangerous trip to Earth. But has anything really prepared them for their life on Earth? Their survival will mean defying impossible odds. So who stays? And who gets to go home?I quite enjoyed this read. It is interesting, thrilling and also sad. There's some drama going on too! I haven\u2019t quite read something like this in a while, or ever actually. I\u2019m happy to have gotten into this one. If you\u2019re a fan of science and the beauty of the sky above our heads, you will be in for a treat.Throughout my reading, I did find the style of writing to be beautiful and also slightly annoying. Let me share how. As you read, you\u2019ll find \u2018see\u2019 as \u2018c\u2019 and other short form terms that might be slightly irritating. However, thinking about it again, it does add that effect that makes you understand the story more, especially since it starts with them not even being on earth (I\u2019m guessing grammar wasn\u2019t going to be an issue). About this book being beautiful, it truly is. It is often poetic.My favourite quote from the book goes, \u201c1 of me falls & dies & a new me rises in his stead. I am a tree, I am a mushroom, I replace myself. I am not who I thought I was. But maybe that\u2019s not true. Maybe I always knew. Maybe I just didn\u2019t want to know\u201d. There are several amazing quotes in this novel and I really appreciate the author for writing down each one of them.All in all, Satellite is an enjoyable, different kind of read.

The story itself, about people being born in space and coming down to earth for the first time, intrigued me, especially with the \"He's going to a place he's never been before - Home\" quote on the cover of the book. And the cover alone is gorgeous and I couldn't not buy it. When I first opened the book and started reading it, I was kind of startled by the way it was written. Everything lowercase, many abbreviations and so on. The beginning of the book was also packed with a LOT of physics, which I did not understand and I wasn't exactly put off by it, but it just wasn't what I expected at all. The story is told from Leo's perspective and he is kind of telling us the story. It does not play in the present. Everything that is in the book has basically already happened. I liked Leo from the start.He was such a sweet and curios kid, fascinated with space and very into physics and becoming an astronaut. All of the secondary characters were pretty well developed too, although Libra and Orion did feel kind of like stereotypes at the beginning. But they had these little quirks and mannerisms that made them unique and lovable. I also like that the story is not focused on romance at all. I do like to read romance books, but I read them a lot, so reading this was refreshing. There were some hints about possible love interests for Leo, which were all male btw and he did talk about his sexuality being gay in some aspects (mentioning that he wants to kiss boys/how attractive boys are, telling Libra he will never have kids in the conventional way, etc), but he never outright labeled himself and I loved that, because this book wasn't about that; that was not the focus, just a nice thing to include. The story didn't really pick up until 2/3rds into the book, but the second it did, shit went down quickly. It was very tense and action packed and I loved every minute of it. I couldn't stop reading it, it was very gripping. One of the deaths in this book hit me really hard as well. I am still not over it btw. I don't think I'll ever be over it. The ending was also very, very beautiful. The words Nick Lake chose fit the mood perfectly and I just loved his writing. I couldn't have asked for a better way to end it and it made me tear up as well. I know this review is all over the place, but in my defense I literally just finished the book and just had to write this review immediately. In conclusion: The book has its weaknesses. Slow start, a lot of physics/space talk I didn't fully understand, the death of a character I loved (it was very sweet but one of the jokes they made wan't very fitting. He was literally dying), words that describe a sound (e.g.: \"shhh\", \"click\", etc.) being used very often. But despite its, what might seem like, many flaws, it has many strong points as well: Great characters, interesting and inventive story, immersive and made me emotional, satisfying ending, action (but not too much of it), great relationship dynamics, Nick Lake seemed very knowledgeable, etc. I loved this book from start to finish. I loved Leo and Libra and Orion from start to finish. It was a wonderful reading experience and I would recommend this book to anyone, no matter how different their usual taste in books might be. I got lost in this world and I wish I could meet the characters in it. It has so many beautiful quotes in it and asked some hart hitting questions. Amazing book.

I so wanted it to be good!So disappointed. Ok, so the book wasn't all that badly written. The story was interesting, the settings of a futuristic world. The way that language sort of deteriorated and was portrayed, c u, tho, etc. The not-so-bad but still noticeable advance in technology, and seeing the wild teens all grown up and living with their tattoos and piercings at like 50 years old. What really got me was at about page 59 I got SMASHED in the face. I had to look again to make sure it said what I first thought it did. And it did. Really? The language in this book was FILTHY. I mean come on! It didn't need it what so ever. NONE! Sure, their out in space, on the brink of death. Yeah strong language could pass. But seriously. That much? That many times? Over and over? Awful. I wanted to wash Leo's mouth with soap. I wanted to wash my mouth with soap! And I was just reading!That's one. The other thing was that Leo is attracted to his \"brother\" Orion. I personally feel like that was not nessecary for the story, and I try to avoid that sort of thing in what I read. So I won't be reading this again, or recommend it to anyone that I know.I'm sorry Mr. Lake.

The book follows the adventures of the three teens and their experiences having been raised on the space station by a team of astronauts. Upon their 16th birthdays they're all deemed strong enough to make their way down to Earth. Each one has a very unique personal tie and family tie that draws them to the crazy world below.  Set in Leo's point of view, Lake does a very good job of navigating the hardships and expectations one would suspect of a teenager experiencing their life up in space and the difficulties and conspiracies that surround the kids with life below on Earth. A rather frustrating, yet clever, note of the story is Leo's lack of grammar which helps to pinpoint the fact that he's more rather \"alien\" and new to what typical life on Earth would be. Also despite the very building crescendos and diminuendos of the plot, Lake fails to provide an ending that is not very cliche (you've reached the light at the end of the tunnel before you even see it).  In light of this, I still give this book 4 out of 5 stars because of overall characterization, plot tensions, and development of the story. A good story and one that I would recommend."}, {"userName": "hahn", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56271464-hahn", "userReview": "this freaking book is my fave. see, i write a review in this way too. so don't worry leo. you're not alone. also this review has everything i wanna say but better.(this is going to be another fave poem)i thank You God for most this amazingday:for the leaping greenly spirits of treesand a blue true dream of sky;and for everythingwhich is natural which is infinite which is yes(i who have died am alive again today,and this is the sun's birthday; this is the birthday of life and love and wings and of the gaygreat happening illimitably earth)how should tasting touching hearing seeingbreathing any-lifted from the noof all nothing-human merely beingdoubt unimaginable You?(now the ears of my ears awake andnow the eyes of my eyes are opened)  e e cummings"}, {"userName": "Meg - A Bookish Affair", "userReviewDate": "Oct 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1132408-meg---a-bookish-affair", "userReview": "\"Satellite\" is the story of Leo who was born on a space station. He wasn't supposed to be born there but his mother's circumstances made it so she didn't find out she was pregnant until she was in space and it would have been too much for her and the baby to reenter the Earth's atmosphere. The small space station is the only home that Leo has ever known. Now, his body may be finally developed enough to go home.This was a really interesting premise. Every once in awhile there seems to be talk of humans someday being able to live in space on various planets (I'm looking at you, Mars). This book takes this idea and turn it on its head. Leo and the twins Orion and Libra are not supposed to live in space but they end up being the first humans to do so and it's not at all what the space agency involved expected. This is a coming of age story with a twist. Leo thinks he knows the whole story as to how and why he's on the space station but he finds out that there is much more. The adults in his life haven't told the whole story. I really liked how the author was able to slowly drop clues to keep you wanting to read about the true reason that Leo, Orion, and Libra are on the space station.

Despite the good story, it felt like reading a book and not like experiencing Leo's story. I wish the editor had nixed the style.
