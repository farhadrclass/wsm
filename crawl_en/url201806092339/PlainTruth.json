In fact, I could hardly put it down from the minute I started reading it. I think Picoult has a genuine talent for writing and coming up with unique story ideas.SPOILER AHEAD!There were a couple of things that bothered me at the end, though. I had pretty much figured out halfway through the book that Sarah had been aware of her daughter's pregnancy and was the one who had hidden the dead infant. I really felt, though, that it was inconsistent of Sarah to have both killed the child and to have hidden the fact. First, the author builds the whole story around certain ideas about this Amish community. She makes it clear that Katie would not have been expelled from the community for having a baby out of wedlock, so it seems extremely unnecessary for her mother to have killed the child. It is also so highly out of character and against everything the Amish believe in to commit a violent act, that it just doesn't make sense that Sarah would kill her innocent, newborn grandson.After killing the baby, it seems even more unlikely that Sarah would not admit to the act after her daughter was accused. It seems much more likely that she would feel compelled to confess and repent, as the author explains again and again is the way the Amish are raised to feel.The ending was certainly shocking, but it just didn't feel consistent with the rest of the book. A bit of a disappointment after such a good read."}, {"userName": "Anemone", "userReviewDate": "Jan 16, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/792295-anemone", "userReview": "I thought this book was pretty crummy even though it was a page-turner. I really wanted to know what happens to Katie, and what happened to the baby so I kept reading, but I didn't really enjoy the experience--I won't be reading again. Too much filler, not enough book.Specifically:* It's set among the Amish. However, I get the feeling the author doesn't really understand them, she just thought it'd be a cool setting. That irritates me.* It's full of overused elements, such \"city girl goes to farm\", \"taking break from evilness ambition brings us\", \"rekindled flame.\" Some of the dialog is the pretty dumb \"You're afraid this relationship might work\" sort of thing. Because of this, you can see where it's going miles down the road. Now, I re-read books, so this isn't itself a killer, when I like the trip. * It has ghosts. What's up with that? Not in a freaky arty Beloved way, but just casually thrown in there. * The language is unnecessarily descriptive. You'd think she was being paid by the word.It did make me think of A Jury of Her Peers, which is worth reading.

I was not intrigued by Katie, I was annoyed and exasperated with her. The dialogue was cheesy in many areas, and the whole thing with Hannah\u2019s ghost was just stupid. I mean, it really does seem that the only reason the ghost was added was so that the author could explain Katie\u2019s attraction to Adam. Oh look, he\u2019s a ghost hunter and I see a ghost\u2014hmmm, it must be meant to be: we should have sex. Blah.I\u2019m really disappointed because I tend to enjoy most of Picoult\u2019s novels."}, {"userName": "Darlene", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1809697-darlene", "userReview": "There is an Amish community close to where I live in western Pennsylvania. Each summer weekend for the past several years, I have traveled to this Amish community, admiring and purchasing the most beautiful and delectable strawberries, blueberries, tomatoes, peppers and squash... all that summer has to offer in my state's relatively short growing season. Over the years I have also developed a growing curiosity about the way this Amish community lives... close to my own community geographically and yet somehow apart. I have become fascinated with the old farmhouses set back from the highway, unspoiled by utility poles and electrical and telephone lines. I have marveled over their horse drawn buggies and the simple plainness of their clothing. When I discovered the novel, Plain Truth by Jodi Picoult, my interest was piqued. Although a work of fiction, the author described spending time living with an Amish family in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. She took this opportunity to immerse herself in the day-to-day life of the family.... helping to prepare meals, playing with the children and arising each morning at 4AM to milk the cows. There are two tracks to this story. The first is a typical storyline in Jodi Picoult's novels and centers around Philadelphia defense attorney, Ellie Hathaway who flees the city.. leaving with her disillusionment over her job and regret over staying in a worn out relationship for far too long. Ellie fled to a place she remembers from her childhood... Paradise, Pennsylvania, home to an Amish community and to her beloved aunt who had , at one time, been part of this 'Plain' community. It wasn't really this aspect of the story I found interesting but rather the second track of the story that captured my thoughts and imagination. In the middle of the night, in an Amish barn, a young woman labored to give birth to her baby. Although it wasn't clear who this young woman was or what her circumstances were, it WAS obvious that she was frightened and alone. After her son was born, .... feeling exhausted and overwhelmed... she fell into a deep sleep and when she awoke, she believed her payers had been answered..... \"Glancing down she realized that a miracle had come to pass: the blood-soaked hay was fresh now, except for a small stain beneath her own bottom. And the two things she had been holding when she fell asleep- the scissors and the newborn-were gone.\"This early morning scene in the barn sets up this story.. a story which is mainly a courtroom drama. The young Amish woman in the story, Katie Fisher, is 18 years old, unmarried and lives with her parents, Aaron and Sarah, on their dairy farm. Although she vehemently denied to police and her family that she gave birth, the medical evidence is irrefutable. She gave birth to a baby boy in her parents' barn and the baby HAD been alive when he was born. Katie Fisher was charged with the murder of her son and visiting defense attorney Ellie Hathaway was hired to represent her in court. Although it seems obvious that Katie Fisher did, in fact, kill her infant, as the case unfolds certain facts about Katie's life, her beliefs and her community are revealed which make the question of her guilt murkier and more difficult to ascertain. Ultimately, and after a couple of plot twists I did not see coming, the question of what happened to Katie Fisher's baby boy was resolved. But it was the details about the Amish community to which she belonged that I found most interesting in this story. Not only was this story a murder mystery of sorts, it was also a thought provoking story about community, justice, morality and redemption. The Amish community live their lives in accordance with the rules of their church.. called the ordnung. As young children, \"the very first thing they learn is that there's always a higher authority to yield to-whether it's your parents, the greater good of the community or God.\" As Ellie was told by members of the community when trying to understand Katie Fisher's state of mind... \"The English judged a person so that they would be justified in casting her out. The Amish judged a person so that they's be justified in welcoming her back.If someone is accused of sinning, it's not so others can place blame. It's so that the person can make amends and move on.\" Ellie also learned another important fact about Katie's community...\"The English culture promotes individuality, while the Amish are deeply entrenched in community. To us (the English), if someone stands out it's no big deal because diversity is respected and expected. To the Amish, there's no room for deviation from the norm. It's important to fit in.The consequences of not fitting in are psychologically tragic. You stand alone when all you've known is being part of a group.\"This book made me think a great deal about individuality which sometimes seems to be synonymous with self-centeredness versus being part of such a close-knit community. I also thought a lot about the law and how it often can seem like a confusing mish mash of what is legal and what is moral... two things which are not always considered by society to be the same. There are actions in our society which some consider immoral but these same actions are not always thought of as illegal by the state. Judgments are made... and sometimes those judgements seem to be made harshly and without compassion. with the sole intent of casting someone OUT of society. Even after people have paid for their mistakes, they are often NOT welcomed back into society. So I wonder... what kind of society could we have if people who have made mistakes were someday welcomed back... free from judgment and stigma.. to pick up their lives and move on?"}, {"userName": "Maria Kemplin", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1252242-maria-kemplin", "userReview": "I liked the concept of this book, but was disappointed in the execution of the story line as well as the writing. My criticisms are as follows (spoilers included):Poor editing left awkward, unfinished, or contradictory elements throughout the book. Ellie argues with Stephen about having a child and says that although he refused to undertake a vasectomy reversal, there are other ways they could have had a baby. Later, the same character said that in her desire for a baby she \"wore Stephen down\" and they tried for 6 months, but she did not get pregnant because \"the relationship was rotten.\" The story line of Ellie's \"problem\" with yearning for a child is choppy and confusing - it reads as if the story was going one way initially and then changed course but wasn't fully corrected. Characters were described superficially and changed awkwardly in the novel without the benefit of character development. Ellie had short \"man hair\", was afraid of relationships, was a hotshot lawyer. Katie is a meek, pure, humble Amish girl. The author spent considerable time building Katie's meekness in temperament and then with only week before the trial, the character goes from barely understanding English and deferring to everything said to her - to using sarcasm, defying her attorney before trial, and there are monumental plot twists revealed about Katie which are poorly executed and not believable. The ghost story line had considerable time spent on it in the beginning, then abruptly ends. It seems like the author intended to do something else with this novel (a paranormal element), but then needed to wrap up and bailed on that story line. Editing could have cut out these unconnected elements and allowed more time to the development of a \"voice\" or set of circumstances where Katie grows, if the author wanted her to do an about face in personality. In the beginning, the author takes the trouble to point out some character who lives in apartments attached to the barn. Elam? He is introduced and then drops from the story, if this character is central enough that he lives with the family, then keep him in the storyline (or cut this character introduction). I suppose he was intended as a diversion - someone else who could have hidden the baby since he lived attached to the barn - but he lives with the family and is never mentioned again, which is a close inspection of life within the microcosm of a particular family.The sudden revelation that teenage Katie had been taking the train on weekends to visit her bother in college, every month for years, was jarring and simply not believable. It would have been more realistic to have sent her for one rebellious weekend visit as she neared adulthood, but not every month for years while a young minor. Englishter parents would not let a minor child go weekends away to stay with her brother in college, much less a Plain family with an excommunicated son. Also, what college boy would welcome his sister staying for the weekend every month during his college years? Better editing could have made this more believable and authentic. The paranormal-studies field for the baby's father - so odd. This storyline didn't go anywhere, and stood out as an unusual loose end. Again, I suspect there was a ghost story line which was pulled from the book. The letters that the brother held.... this was terribly inconsistent. The author writes on one page Ellie's brother had \"no idea\" of the relationship with Katie and was shocked at the suggestion - turn the chapter and suddenly he has a huge stack of letters that he never delivered. We are to believe he has no idea of the relationship between his young Amish sister who is sneaking into the city to visit him so that she can see his room mate. Then we learn the brother has a large stack of undelivered letters from the roommate he is keeping from Katie. These plot elements are embarrassingly inconsistently. I also think the undelivered letters was hackeneyed. I was interested in the premise of the book. I think editing could have corrected the contradictory elements, worked in elements where lines were unraveling, and better developed the characters. This could have been a much better book with more attentive editing - and more pointedly, better writing."}, {"userName": "Vanessa", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/44569697-vanessa", "userReview": "This is my third Jodi Picoult read, and it wasn't my favorite, though I did enjoy it. The plot of the story really intrigued me because, as is mentioned throughout the story, it's not every day that you hear of a young Amish woman accused of murdering her own newborn. I loved Picoult's attention to detail throughout the story; she obviously did a great deal of research on the Amish way of life and really embraced the characters. Her research shined through the beautifully detailed descriptions of life on an Amish dairy farm and the unique personalities of characters like Aaron Fisher. I was not very surprised by the ending of the novel, but I did love working alongside the characters throughout the course of the book to unravel the mystery of Baby Fisher's death. While I really do appreciate Picoult's detail and how realistic she made characters like Katie and Ellie, my biggest complaint is that the story just seemed to go on and on. I became fatigued with reading what I felt like were the same scenes over and over, and I felt like the book could have been a good deal shorter. Also, I didn't really get the point of including the ghost/paranormal side story. I understand the message behind what Adam and Katie talked about in relation to energy never dying, just transforming, but it felt like Picoult intended for the ghost storyline to play a larger part and then just decided to kind of let it fade and move on with other elements.Despite my complaints, I would still recommend this to Picoult fans for what it is: a really descriptive account of the Amish/Plain way of life and how the English and Amish ways of life cross paths."}, {"userName": "Jann", "userReviewDate": "May 06, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1110107-jann", "userReview": "Far be it for me to ruin anything for anyone who has yet to read this, but I really hated the end. I really, really hated it. This book had five stars in my head until I read the ending, if that gives you any indication how much I hated the ending. Now, that being said: the rest of this book was great. The characters, for the most part, had depth and were questioning various aspects of their own morality. I have to admit that the main character, Ellie, fell a little flat. Okay, a lot flat. What is it with Jodi Picoult and these emotionally incompentent ambitious female attorneys who meet a kind, gentle male and then question their career plans and fear of commitment? It's getting a little old and it's only the second book of hers I've read. I'm kind of hoping it isn't a theme, because I've had several friends promise that other stories of hers are worth reading. I'm not sure I can stand one more two-dimensional character with a brash personality.The rest of the characters were much better. From the simple and adoring farmboy-suitor, Samuel, who is the Plain match for Katie (our accused) all the way through the stoic and suffering father who is racked with guilt at how his family's lives have turned out, the Amish characters are engrossing. But they seem truly Amish in this: not a single one is more likeable or unlikeable as the next. There isn't a single one who stands out. Even Katie, as a central character, really blends in with those around her. The underlying themes of disassociation with painful subjects, how to be true to yourself and your beliefs when no one believes you, accepting responsiblity for both appearances and your actions, and ultimately how a lie is okay as long as it makes everything better for those around you (that might be snide, because I don't think that's what the author was trying to convey--did I mention I hated the ending?) will resonate with readers for a long time after the book is closed. I'm not sure it's enough to keep me going back for more, though."}, {"userName": "Mafi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2237043-mafi", "userReview": "Apesar de ser um livro j\u00e1 antigo (faz 18 anos que foi publicado) gostei muito de o ler. Desta vez a autora fala sobre a comunidade amish, uma comunidade que j\u00e1 conhecia mas que n\u00e3o sabia a fundo os seus costumes e cren\u00e7as. \u00c9 um livro longo, enrola um bocadinho mas l\u00ea-se sempre com muita vontade e gosto.(...)O que talvez mais goste na autora \u00e9 ela conseguir sempre introduzir diferentes cen\u00e1rios nos seus livros com alguma pesquisa mas sem serem aborrecidos. Desta vez iremos conhecer a comunidade Amish de uma pequena cidade americana. Para quem n\u00e3o sabe os Amish s\u00e3o um povo religioso que surgiu na Alemanha (e isso \u00e9 bem patente no livro com v\u00e1rias frases em alem\u00e3o). A sociedade espalhou-se pelos Estados Unidos e Canad\u00e1 mas hoje em dia s\u00e3o uma minoria (aproximadamente 150 mil). S\u00e3o um povo conservador que tenta viver a vida de maneira simples (da\u00ed o t\u00edtulo do livro). N\u00e3o acreditam/usam em tecnologias e at\u00e9 mesmo electricidade. Vivem em quintas, cultivam os seus produtos e comem da terra. Tudo o que represente avan\u00e7o \u00e9 contra os valores tradicionais dos Amish, que como povo de culto, a religi\u00e3o est\u00e1 em primeiro lugar. (...)Embora o ponto principal seja o assassinato do beb\u00e9, acho que o tema central sem d\u00favida s\u00e3o os Amish, especialmente o sistema judicial, quando eles nem acreditam ou seguem qualquer legisla\u00e7\u00e3o. Foi muito interessante ver que at\u00e9 \u00e0s pr\u00f3prias testemunhas tinham dificuldade em jurar em tribunal. Todos os costumes de viver uma vida simples v\u00e3o de encontro ao facto de algu\u00e9m querer matar um beb\u00e9 e isso cria ainda mais conflito em toda a trama. De modo a aligeirar o livro, ainda h\u00e1 uma pitada de romance por parte da Ellie que achei desnecess\u00e1rio, embora tenha um meio para um fim muito espec\u00edfico. (...)O final foi o esperado, pelo menos da minha parte. J\u00e1 ao in\u00edcio tinha formado duas teorias de quem podia ter assassinado o beb\u00e9 e adivinhei umas delas, por isso o final para mim foi previs\u00edvel mas satisfat\u00f3rio. Se \u00e9 o melhor livro da autora? N\u00e3o, de todo. \u00c9 um livro que foi publicado originalmente h\u00e1 18 anos atr\u00e1s e por essa altura j\u00e1 a autora tinha um percurso de grandes livros. Este \u00e9 um bom livro para quem quer come\u00e7ar a ler Jodi e n\u00e3o queira ler logo os melhores da autora com medo de ir com expectativas elevadas e n\u00e3o gostar. \u00c9 um livro com um enredo s\u00f3lido e boas personagens e com o melhor que esta autora sabe fazer: pensar sobre a sociedade de hoje em dia e os nossos valores.

Families and how they screw us up! Ha-ha-ha! In my last book, Auntie Janet\u2019s Gallstone, I drew heavily from my experiences with my Auntie Janet. She is such a brave woman and I felt I had to tell her story, you know? I didn\u2019t even think about it, I just wrote it down. In this book, I took a different approach. I looked at my family and thought God, what a bunch of crazies! This would make for such a funny book, and people could so relate. And judging from the feedback so far, I think they have!Could you outline the plot for us?Well, there isn\u2019t a plot as such. I know, crazy right! I just sort of wrote down some of the anecdotes my family tells, or just snippets of conversation. Like one part of the book is just my dad, who is crazy, talking about the time he lost a sock behind the bed, then couldn\u2019t find it for weeks. I won\u2019t spoil the ending by telling you where it ended up! But this book is really, um . . . experimental. It has more in common with really great writers like B.S. Johnson or Gilbert Sorrentino. It\u2019s like a more accessible take on those guys.Do you have a good relationship with your readers?Oh, totally. With my last book, I got so many letters from people saying things like \u2018my aunt had her gallstones out too, I can sympathise\u2019 and \u2018your characters were almost believable.\u2019 I was really moved by some of the feedback I got from you guys! I\u2019m successful \u2018cause I\u2019m just like everyone else, you know, writing about regular people I suppose. I\u2019m easy to read. I was discussing this with Mike [husband] by the pool yesterday. \u2018Cept he wasn\u2019t listening AS USUAL! He\u2019d lost the keys to the Ferrari, AGAIN!What advice would you offer young writers?Write from the heart. Write from experience. Write down the day-to-day details of your life. Don\u2019t worry about spelling or grammar. Just express yourself. Keep an ear tuned to the problems in your family, and write them down. Nothing is sacred. People love reading stuff they can relate to! No detail is boring or irrelevant. We are lucky in this country to have a print culture that encourages people to write the first thing that comes into their head and print it, almost without exception! As long as it is real. And about families. And real. You have to feel it. Did I mention that it has to be real? Ha-ha-ha!How did you react to your almost immediate success?I was totally blown away. I\u2019d just starting writing when people were flinging awards at me. I mean, literally \u2013 agents came to my house and threw money at me when I was trying to write! It was little distracting to be honest. I mean, it can\u2019t have hurt being married to the man who owns Penguin Books, and having a dad that owns Random House, and performing oral sex on every book reviewer in America, but I\u2019d like to think it\u2019s my talent that carried me to the top. That and the guy I paid to write my books for me.Thank you, Jodi.Hey, no problem. I read some of your stuff, by the way. Couldn\u2019t really get into it. Too many ten-dollar words.

I didn't like the main character, Katie, she came across as cold and distant and I found it difficult to muster up any feeling for her. I felt that the 'ghost' references surrounding Hannah were just silly and unnecessary to the overall plot. There was something just lacking with this book as normally I find Picoult's books very much page turners, but not this one. The ending was very flat and rushed, even with the 'twist'.

Jodi is always good...even when she's just okay (as in Sister's Keeper). And while a lot of her themes come from headlines (she's like the novel versions of Law and Order) they always have a different twist that takes a lot of sensitivity and creativity.The Plain Truth was no exception. Although most of the book was from the perspective of Ellie, the lawyer, the most developed character here was Katie-the Amish defendant. I don't know if Jodi spent time with the Amish or not to research her book, but she did really seem to know her subjects very well. However, Katie is a contradiction in terms, in every single aspect of her life. She loves being Amish, but she also loves visiting her excommunicated brother at State College. She loves Samuel, the Amish suitor she's known her whole life, but she also loves Adam, the roommate/landlord of her brother. Katie both loves children, and denies her pregnancy. She has more compassion when Ellie becomes pregnant then she ever did for herself. Finally, Katie is a God-fearing, devout women, but she also firmly believes she regularly sees her dead sister. As a reader, you know; the entire book that Katie did not kill her baby. And it's only in the last few paragraphs that you finally find out who did. If there was anything that bothered me about this book, it was the baby; the beautiful baby boy that was spoken of constantly, but never regarded as a person who had casually lost his life to secrecy.

As a stipulation of Katie's bail, Ellie must become her guardian and so moves into the Fishers' home, and their relationship, Ellie's growing understanding and appreciation of the Amish way of life and the mystery of who killed the infant in the Fishers' barn is masterfully woven together into a drop-everything-and-read-it-cover-to-cover-in-one-sitting story."}, {"userName": "Petra X", "userReviewDate": "Jun 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1237196-petra-x", "userReview": "Of all Picoult's books this is the only one (that I read, and I read ad nauseum - until the formulaic writing got me) that had a really good ending. It wasn't original, it's been done before, but in this context it wasn't guessable. The Plain Truth would make an excellent horror film a la Stephen King."}, {"userName": "Dora Santos Marques", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13631670-dora-santos-marques", "userReview": "A minha opini\u00e3o em v\u00eddeo: https://youtu.be/QB8o8sYZH1o"}, {"userName": "Thomas", "userReviewDate": "May 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2018505-thomas", "userReview": "\"Plain Truth\" is about Ellie Hathaway, a lawyer from Pennsylvania who comes to an Amish community to defend Katie, an eighteen year old accused of murdering her own newborn child. During the bail process of Katie's trial, Ellie becomes her bail official person, or the person that must stay with Katie always so she can stay at her farm home. While Ellie stays with Katie, she learns the ways of the Amish community and their practices, their ways of life, and their obvious truth. And everything gets more complicated when a man from Ellie's past decides to reenter her life to assist in Katie's trial. Ellie builds a strong bond with Katie while trying to figure out what really happened on the night of the allegated murder, and also searches deep inside of herself to figure out what she really wants the most in her life.I really do love Jodi Picoult's writing. Her characters are so realistic and throughout the story I felt like I really, personally knew them. Although she always writes about hot button topics, she accurately described the Amish community and how they lived, which made me feel privileged to be able to witness an entire book through their lives, even if it is fiction. Her writing is also mesmerizing, if I wasn't so busy this week I probably would've finished this book in a couple of days. The only thing I didn't love about this book was the twist at the end, although it helps wrap up the plot, it makes you question what message Picoult has been trying to establish through the entire nvoel. I still would give it five stars, read it!"}, {"userName": "Annette", "userReviewDate": "Sep 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1183225-annette", "userReview": "Wow.

In this melodrama, a baby is found dead in a barn of an Amish family.

First off, the style got pretty confusing at times. Picoult used multiple narrators and switched between third-person and first-person so often that there was a few times I didn't know whose point-of-view I was reading. SPOILER ALERTThe ending of the book was rather predictable. About a third of the way through the book I noticed that Picoult didn't put too much focus on Katie's mother, which immediately made me think, her mom did it. Also, the characters themselves weren't consistent. One minute Katie was sneaking out of the house and having sex, and the next minute she was a blushing innocent girl. One minute Katie hated Samuel, the next minute she was distraught that he was ignoring her. None of it made any sense. Ellie's character also really annoyed me. She was supposed to be a smart, high-powered attorney, yet the obvious always seemed to phase her. There was also a weird side plot with ghost that didn't seem to fit the story at all. I guess it was supposed to give Katie some closure with the dead infant and her sister, but it was really just bizarre. Suffice to say, I won't be reading anymore of Picoult's books."}, {"userName": "Carol", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/980911-carol", "userReview": "Who wants to read about a teenager or a larger than life female attorney? Sarah is the character with the most potential for development. How can a woman who has lost a son and stands to lose a daughter endlessly tolerate the law of her husband and church, yet act independently to do a lawless deed--and never confess it? I think the author did a tremendous job of defining Sarah without having her say two words. I think the author missed a chance to explore Sarah's insecurities and misgivings as a wife/parishioner, shown through actions of deception (Katie's trips to State College), and of course, \"her deed.\" Sarah's failure to defend a relationship with her own sister, who had openly made decisions about her life, suggests another layer of her character. Was is fear of husband/church, or was it too hurtful to see what she had missed? Ellie should have learned from Sarah--not Katie--about making up for missed/messed-up opportunities."}, {"userName": "Dannika", "userReviewDate": "Mar 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/845746-dannika", "userReview": "I had resisted reading a book by this author for a long time, without any valid reason, just because I saw her all over on the shelves at Target, or something. Boy am I sorry I did. I really liked listening to this book even though the voices of the narrators bothered me. The characters and the story were compelling even though they were mildly predictable, but not in a take your intelligence for granted kind of way.

Fortunately for Katie, at the time of her arrest, she has a distant and unknown relative named Ellie Hathaway, who is a high profile criminal attorney. Ellie is taking a much needed break from her career after concluding a stressful criminal trial and ending her eight year relationship that failed to yield the child Ellie so desperately wants. With reservation, and after some urging from a mutual Aunt, Ms. Hathaway agrees to take Katie on as a client and as part of Katie's bail conditions, she winds up living with her client on the Fisher family farm. The reader is taken on an emotional journey with both Katie and Ellie, as Ellie struggles to maintain her professionalism and neutrality in a case that hits too close to home for the accomplished professional. Some of the great strengths of this novel are the socially relevant subject matter, the intriguing plot, well-developed and captivating characters, and the author's signature twist at the conclusion of the novel. I personally appreciated the way that Ellie embarks on a journey of self-discovery, learning about herself through Katie's experience and her reaction to Katie's circumstances. The reader is taken on a similar journey and is forced to reflect on his or her own culture as she learns about the Amish way of life. While I valued this book for the insight it provided me into Amish culture, my big takeaway was that despite cultural differences, human nature remains the same and transcends cultural barriers. I think this book has the potential to provide a rewarding experience to readers. Picoult and Current Events I have come to expect that any Picoult novel I read will tackle both controversial and socially relevant material. I was not disappointed in my expectations. While reading this book, I couldn't help but to reflect back upon the Kermit Gosnell trial and some of the horrors that came to light during that event. The media frenzy that surrounded Katie Fisher's trial stands in marked contrast to the absence of media attention in the Gosnell trial. Interestingly , the setting for both was in Pennsylvania. At any rate, it's good to know that at least in fiction, the murder of newborn infants is still looked upon with horror and moral outrage."}, {"userName": "Connie", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4146473-connie", "userReview": "Once again Ms Picoult does not disappoint. She has told a story of a tragic occurance with characters that are very real and likable. The story centers around a young Amish girl, Katie Fischer who has been charged with the murder of her newborn baby. Enter the hardened and world weary Ellie Hathaway to defend her \"cousin\". Though the story follows the investigation and trial, the true story lies in the relationship between these two women and their two worlds colliding. In the end it is perhaps Ellie that is the more naive of the two and is made to open her eyes. (to see the Plain Truth!) I appreciated the realism that Picoult gives the reader of the \"Plain World\" and it all rang very true from what I have learned. I also appreciated how she was able to show us the bias and misunderstanding of this simple way of life.  Strong characters with a suspenseful page turner gives this a solid 3.5 stars, up to a 4 due to the fascination with the Amish life."}, {"userName": "Emily", "userReviewDate": "Jan 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1576782-emily", "userReview": "This is the first Jodi Picoult novel that I've read and I have got to be honest- I'm not too impressed. \"Plain Truth\" is about an Amish girl who secretly had a baby and is being accused of killing it and a big shot girl-power lawyer who tries to defend her. The story line itself is interesting and is what compelled me to finish. I like the court setting, the mystery, and I also liked learning a bit about the Amish- but this book should have been much shorter than it was. There were a lot of words, but not a lot of movement in the story line. I found a large portion of this book and it's characters to be extremely tedious and exasperating.

The book had its flaws -- there were aspects which were difficult to believe and/or could have been better written, and I wasn't 100% sure she got the Amish thing right, even though she claims to have received affirmation to that effect from formerly Amish individuals. However, I give her credit for selecting an original topic and setting, and maintaining my consistently high level of interest for 400-some pages (even though I did guess the \"surprise ending\" about halfway through). Not many authors can do that.

But that peace is shattered by the discovery of a dead infant in the barn of an Amish farmer. A police investigation quickly leads to two startling disclosures: the newborn's mother is an unmarried Amish woman, eighteen-year-old Katie Fisher. And the infant did not die of natural causes. Although Katie denies the medical proof that she gave birth to the child, circumstantial evidence leads to her arrest for the murder of her baby. One hundred miles away, Philadelphia defense attorney Ellie Hathaway has achieved an enviable, high-profile career. But her latest court victory has set the sands shifting beneath her. Single at thirty-nine and unsatisfied with her relationship, Ellie doesn't look back when she turns down her chance to make partner and takes off for an open-ended stay at her great-aunt's home in Paradise. Fate brings her to Katie Fisher. Suddenly, Ellie sees the chance to defend a client who truly needs her, not just one who can afford her. But taking on this case challenges Ellie in more ways than one. She finds herself not only in a clash of wills with a client who does not want to be defended but also in a clash of cultures with a people whose channels of justice are markedly different from her own. Immersing herself in Katie Fisher's life -- and in a world founded on faith, humility, duty, and honesty -- Ellie begins to understand the pressures and sacrifices of those who to live plain. As she peels away the layers of fact and fantasy, Ellie calls on an old friend for guidance. Now, just as this man from Ellie's past reenters her life, she must uncover the truth about a complex case, a tragic loss, the bonds of love -- and her own deepest fears and desires.", "title": "Plain Truth", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14864.Plain_Truth", "average": 3.97, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1389750843l/14864.jpg", "reviews": 6490, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7128.Jodi_Picoult", "name": "Jodi Picoult"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Contemporary"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14864.Plain_Truth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/358663.Plain_Truth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1767864.Plain_Truth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38492182-uma-verdade-simples", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3104030-plain-truth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6397204-plain-truth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/625341.Plain_Truth", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10917.My_Sister_s_Keeper", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14866.Nineteen_Minutes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10916.The_Pact", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15753740-the-storyteller", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28587957-small-great-things", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
