In England, werewolves are titled and part of society. Her family thinks they are punishing by sending her away, but Faith is so unloved at home, casting her off is just another part of her life. When she lands in England, she is greeted by her future husband, she just doesn\u2019t know it yet. Faith loves to collect rocks. In her mind:\u201cRocks represent so much time and space, so much history. Yet they\u2019re so solid and unchanging themselves.\u201dShe has an extensive collection, all carefully organized. She also prefers to wear pants and last year\u2019s style. She doesn\u2019t quite fit into \u201cnormal\u201d society. The family that has taken her in are adorable, and nice and want her to be happy. Faith really can\u2019t believe her good fortune.Our hero is Major Channing Channing \u2013 and yes, his parents gave him the same first name as his last name. Channing is a werewolf, gamma in his pack (third in command) and the head of the BUR, The Bureau of Unnatural Registry. He meets Faith as she lands in England because he has received word that there are \u201cSundowner bullets\u201d being smuggled into England, and as these bullets can kill both werewolves and vampires, Channing doesn\u2019t want them getting into the wrong hands. As Faith\u2019s luggage weighs very heavy due to all of her rocks, he gets suspicious and searches through all her things, much to her rage.These two start to meet again as they are invited to the same balls, and because Channing\u2019s alpha owns a hat store, and helps the ladies with all of their fashion requirements \u2013 something Faith is in need of. As they start to spend time together, their biting banter starts to become more flirtatious.This is a slow-burn romance and it worked so well for me. Both Faith and Channing have had loss in their life (I won\u2019t go into it as not to spoil) and they eventually bond over that. They are both strong-willed, independent and stubborn, which makes their pairing quite delightful. Channing has chosen a path in his life to be alone, except for time spent with his pack. And Faith never thought she would have another chance at love after her disaster back at home. It takes time for the two of them to trust what their hearts are saying, but it\u2019s a wonderful journey to their HEA.Channing is so gruff and grumpy and there are really cute scenes with his pack as they give him a hard time when they can tell he is falling for Faith. This paranormal world isn\u2019t as violent as other worlds. We get a more quirky cast of characters and it was a refreshing change.Their eventual declaration of love for each other was so sweet and made me smile. A really fun collection of characters, and a hero and heroine you can\u2019t help but root for. I really like this author\u2019s voice.Grade: B+"}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "May 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2169214-stephanie", "userReview": "This fantasy romance novella was absolutely delightful (like all of Gail Carriger's fantasy romance novellas - I really love them). The first third or so is just deliciously witty and fun, full of laugh-out-loud banter and hilarity, and then the story naturally morphs into something much more deeply emotional, and it becomes truly moving. The ending was absolutely lovely and made me very, very happy for both characters. I loved Faith as a heroine, I loved the new family she found/built throughout the novella, and although I started out really NOT loving Channing for his behavior, Gail Carriger does such a wonderful job that by the end, I really, truly loved the way that Faith and Channing fit together.I can't wait for Carriger's next novella! I really enjoy her full-length books, but these fantasy romance novellas have been just *wonderful.*"}, {"userName": "Roo Barb", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32545892-roo-barb", "userReview": "I just finished HTMAW. I wasn't sure if I'd like this book, Channing always irritated me, he's just so, \"Major Channing Channing of the Chesterfield Channings.\" Oh boy was I wrong, so, so wrong.I may reread it shortly, I think I'll need to reread it today.if you're new to Gail's books you could start with this one, personally I'd start at the beginning with Soulless but this book will stand alone.I loved it so much, it had the feel of a good Georgette Heyer. I had shivers of happiness thrilling through me as I read it. Gail Carriger, it's a beautiful book.

Overall I think How to Marry A Werewolf is definitely one of my favorite novellas of Gail's so far. Faith is a darling and I love, love, love her cousin Teddy! The pacing and the intertwining of romance and plot are just right, and it's always great to see Biffy, Lyall, and the rest of the pack again. Gail is in rare form with this one; the comedy is hysterical and the sass levels are legendary. I definitely recommend this novella :)"}, {"userName": "Jessica", "userReviewDate": "Apr 30, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3001449-jessica", "userReview": "What a lovely novella about the prickliest member of the London Werewolf Pack! I loved that the love interest was from America and as always in Gail Carriger's works, a strong enough woman to stand on her own next to a very tough (yet surprisingly tender) man. I loved Faith's introduction to Biffy and the pack and the way that the entire pack ended up interacting with her and her cousins in London. Teddy, her cousin Theodora, was a delightful side character and I'd love to see her mentioned again later just so I can see how she's doing with her horsey husband. I could easily have read a full size novel about these characters and look forward to the next Claw & Courtship novella!!!"}, {"userName": "(Tori-Smexybooks) smexys_sidekick", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3094317-tori-smexybooks-smexys-sidekick", "userReview": "An enjoyable novella that revisits Ms. Carriger's Parasol Protectorate world with the wooing and romancing of a certain very grump gamma wolf and a young American woman for whom a moment of ill trust almost destroyed her."}, {"userName": "Kelly", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2903768-kelly", "userReview": "It makes me want to go back and reread the rest of her works!"}, {"userName": "Yvonne", "userReviewDate": "May 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5577584-yvonne", "userReview": "Channing as we never expected to see him - in society interacting with human females.

Seeing as this novella was nearly 200 pages, I would have like for it to have been stretched to a full length novel in order to provide more for the plot happening behind the romance.

I've thoroughly enjoyed each of the ones I've read in this world. Don't know if this story would be as robust if you haven't read the Parasol Protectorate (FIRST) and the Custard Protocol (SECOND). But if you have - this is another fun romp in this universe.

As such, it's great to get to visit with these characters again, while getting to know the Gamma wolf Channing and the protagonist of the story, Faith Wigglesworth. Their relationship flows through story with such ease and builds over the length of the story, with each facing and confronting their fears in turn, that you don't realize how fast you're reading until the last 20 percent and then you're really rooting for these two people.Great read.The cover doesn't do this story justice.

I have loved all of Miss Carriger\u2019s pairings throughout the years and in different worlds, but Faith and Channing now have a very special place in my heart.
