Storm illustrates the typical life at the North Sea Coast, which was in the past a permanent fight against the unpredictability of our nature. It\u00b4s a fact that the life at the coast gives barely any opportunities for needless things and this is represented in his use of language, because It\u00b4s written in a simple and facile way. For people with big interests in historical literature, this book should be a highlight. However it\u00b4s not easy to read, because the reader has to get used to the linguistically expressions from the 18th and 19th century. The plot and the development of the story are all in all perfectly written."}, {"userName": "Jan-Maat", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5617661-jan-maat", "userReview": "The Rider on the White Horse was Theodor Storm's last completed work before his death. At the centre is a man trying to do his job in a new way, that will bring him fame, renown and satisfaction, and the price that he will have to pay for what ever he may achieve. We might remember that white horses are often sacred (around the North sea region, and this is a regional story) and there's a cost to mortals in getting too involved with the divine. We are held at arm's length away from this story by a series of framing devices: the author remembering reading the story as a boy in a newspaper, the newspaper story which is told by a traveller who takes refuge in an inn during a storm, while there he is told the story of Hauke Haien by the village school teacher. We are at a remove from the events of the story, and each step takes us further back in time emphasising our alienation from the characters of the story, it's a different world.This is a world of coastal marshlands threatened by storms and floods. An unenlightened world of pre-Christian superstition and at the same time Christian belief in the absolute power of God. The separation of the village from the narrator (and the reader) is marked by a linguistic threshold, the first person he meets in the village speaks in dialect (the same device is used in Aquis Submersus). The difference in speech suggesting any number of cultural differences.Unlike Theodor Storm, Haien does not seek to make his mark through literature but through building a new dyke that will increase the amount of land protected from the sea. This might be the story of the hubris of man against the forces of nature, or man against the fickle will of the divine, or indeed one man against the community, Hauke who has learnt geometry from a Dutch edition of Euclid (note that it is a Dutch edition, knowledge itself is foreign here) versus the men who want to bury a puppy alive into the dyke to ensure that it will stand strong against the weather since life must pay for life. But Hauke can't escape. He lives in the community, the community shapes how he will be remembered.When Hauke, learned in Euclid, criticises the profile of the traditional dykes pointing out that they are not fit for purpose his father - the cleverest man in the village (not much of a compliment, particularly if the village is a small one) - calls him the wonderchild of Lubeck, learning in this place, in this time is more improbable than miracles and wonderchildren. In death Hauke becomes a ghost, galloping on his fatal, otherworldly horse along his dyke. This is a world untouched by the Enlightenment and so even in death there is no escape from an unfriendly magical universe that now swallows up the man and resurrects him as a supernatural figure.While in Aquis Submersus the couple in love can never marry and their lives will be unfulfilled here marriage isn't sufficient. Hauke's need to prove himself through his work keeps Hauke apart from his wife, Elke. Eventually when a child is born to them she is lack-witted, simple and fearful. To a superstitious mind this is another judgement from the beyond - man should not over step his bounds.Were it not for the fact that the man's work survives his death, and the death of his wife and daughter (since in this unenlightened universe life must pay for life), this would be a thoroughly pessimistic ending to a life of creativity. Having read a few of Theodor Storm's stories this is the end point of a trend of increasing pessimism. Had he lived longer, the mind shudders to imagine how desperately dark his writing might have become!\nDat is de Dod, de allens fritt,Nimmt Kunst un Wetenschop di mit;De kloke Mann is nu vergahn,Gott gaew em selig Uperstahn."}, {"userName": "Alexander", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51451072-alexander", "userReview": "Ein echter Klassiker, dem ich noch viele Leser w\u00fcnsche. \u00dcberraschend fl\u00fcssig zu lesen ist diese wortgewaltige, zug\u00e4ngliche Novelle, der ihr Alter sehr wohl anzumerken ist, jedoch tut dies dem Lesevergn\u00fcgen keinerlei Abbruch.

Most evocative is the description of the northern German Plaines (Nordfriesland) where floods threatened the livelihood and even the lives of the local peasants.

I\u2019m going to be honest: my German is rusty enough that I had to make use of various online tools (and an online synopsis) to figure out what was going on at a couple of points. Once I had started to get into it, it was possible for me to follow, but this is definitely not a book for a beginner, or anyone whose German is only middling. Part of the problem (for me, at least) is the narrative structure. There\u2019s a meta-story, about a guy being driven into a bar by a storm and meeting an elderly school-teacher, and a sub-meta story, about how the school-teacher heard the real story, which is about Hauke Haien, a legendary local figure. Because most of the story is being related by this internal character, the main narrative uses single quotes (because they're all inside the generic double-quotes of the narrator\u2019s dialogue). This can be confusing, especially if you\u2019re not familiar with the appearance of German quotes. Furthermore, while the book is from 1888, but the main narrative takes place in the 18th century (the meta-narrative is set in the 1830s), and I think this also accounts for its alien-ness. It also takes place in Schleswig-Holstein/Denmark (northern Frisia), and so it has some cultural and linguistic eccentricities that may confuse readers more familiar with other parts of Germany. It\u2019s not actually in dialect, which I probably would have found impossible to read, but some non-standard German terms are included. There are notes in German at the back of the book, which offer some assistance, although I often found that the words they picked out as strange were cognates with English and thus the notes were less useful than I would have hoped. The main story is about a young man with a somewhat liberal education who grows up near a complex set of dykes, which protect the local farmers from flooding. At an early age, he sees a way to improve these dykes and thus reduce the number of catastrophic floods, but he must work for years to become the new Deichgraf (literally \u201cdyke reeve,\u201d or an administrator of the dykes) to implement his idea. Along the way, he conveniently falls in love with the old Deichgraf\u2019s daughter, which helps to further his career. Once he is Deichgraf, he has to deal with resentment from an ousted rival, and a strange superstition among the locals regarding his pale horse (connected to the title). Nevertheless, he manages to get the work done to improve the dykes, but ultimately pays a heavy price for it, in a way that seems to confirm the locals\u2019 sense of him as a man who has defied God. It\u2019s not really the sort of thing I go for, in a lot of ways. It struck me as rather traditionally romantic and conservative, but it did hold my interest and manage to be a pretty effective story. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be seeking out any more Theodor Storm to read, but I\u2019m glad to have this one under my belt."}, {"userName": "Fragmentage", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6621776-fragmentage", "userReview": "Der Schimmelreiter spielt in Friesland in einer Ortschaft an der K\u00fcste, in der man dem Meer mit Respekt und Furcht begegnet und der Deichgraf der wichtigste Mann am Ort ist. Da ich viele Sommer meiner Kindheit auf einer Nordseeinsel verbringen durfte, konnte ich mir die Landschaft, das Wetter und die \u00f6rtlichen Zusammenh\u00e4nge, die Storm beschreibt, bildhaft vorstellen.

In winter I liked the small chamber to the right of the vestibule, and in summer the large room on the left, on whose white-washed wall, in mahogany frames, they had hung some pictures cut from the Reformation almanac. From the western window of that room, all one could see was a single-far off windmill; but there was also the whole broad sky, which every evening absolutely filled the entire room with radiance!

Dar\u00fcber hinaus ist jedoch auch das pers\u00f6nliche Drama des Protagonisten ber\u00fchrend- wer seine Sprachlosigkeit gegen\u00fcber seiner geliebten Frau und seinen Zorn gegen\u00fcber der Gesellschaft, die ihn als verblendeten Vision\u00e4r abtut und ausgrenzt, erkennt, leidet sofort mit.Sprachlich gesehen sind besonders die Bilder, die Theodor Storm von der Landschaft und besonders dem unerbittlichen, unbez\u00e4hmbaren Meer erwirft, von einer Sch\u00f6nheit, die unter die Haut geht."}, {"userName": "Flickercat", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16724311-flickercat", "userReview": "Mir gef\u00e4llt die maritime Atmosph\u00e4re mit den Schilderungen \u00fcber das raue, oft anstrengende Leben zur damaligen Zeit an der Nordseek\u00fcste wirklich gut. Man bekommt einen bildhaften Eindruck von Haukes Lebensumfeld. Die Darstellung von der ruhigen, unersch\u00fctterlichen Liebe zwischen ihm und seiner Frau fand ich ebenso gelungen wie die Schauereinfl\u00fcsse und die zunehmende Feindlichkeit der anderen Dorfbewohner.Etwas gew\u00f6hnungsbed\u00fcrftig ist die Art der Charaktere, zu sprechen \u2013 einige Dialoge haben mich etwas zum Schmunzeln gebracht, weil sie f\u00fcr unsere Ohren heute reichlich seltsam klingen w\u00fcrden. Es gibt auch den einen oder anderen Begriff, den man nicht sofort versteht. Aber was man sich nicht aus dem Kontext zusammenreimen kann, kann man in einem Verzeichnis am Ende des Buches problemlos nachschlagen.Ich kann nur empfehlen, den \u201eSchimmelreiter\u201c mal im Herbst w\u00e4hrend eines Urlaubs an der See zu lesen, am besten bei eher windigem Wetter \u2013 ich fand den Effekt ziemlich beeindruckend. :D"}, {"userName": "Igzy Dewitt", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41648017-igzy-dewitt", "userReview": "I came to this novel on the recommendation that Theodor Storm was a prime example of the German Romantic Movement. Not knowing what that entailed, my expectations were of a very Prussian Hawthorne, Melville, or Byron. A word of warning, Hawthorne is downright full of sunshine compared to Mr. Storm. The stories themselves are pretty, at times almost surreal, but the emotional constructions in them fall flat for me. If you're looking to go to bed haunted by regret and loss, this might be the book for you!"}], "description": "The Dykemaster (1888), is the tale of a legendary young dykemaster at odds with his community. Innovative and creative, he designs a new form of dyke. While supervising his work, he rides his grey horse along the dyke. When he is unwilling to engage in a sacrificial ritual of a dog to celebrate completion of the work, villagers think he is in the hands of evil powers. The passing of time and tides contributes to this misconception and he becomes a legend, a phantom riding his grey along the dyke whenever the sea threatens to break through. Storm's highly sophisticated narrative-within-a narrative structure is far in advance of its time. Denis Jackson's brilliant translation of Der Schimmelreiter recreates the full impact of Theodor Storm's masterpiece, which was totally lacking in previous English versions.", "title": "The Dykemaster", "url": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/574704.The_Dykemaster", "average": 3.43, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1454376377l/574704.jpg", "reviews": 118, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/6556.Theodor_Storm", "name": "Theodor Storm"}], "type": ["Classics", "European Literature", "Fiction", "Academic", "Cultural"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/574704.The_Dykemaster", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1210271.Der_Schimmelreiter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1210279.Der_Schimmelreiter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24947848-der-schimmelreiter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1210272.Der_Schimmelreiter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3338904-the-rider-on-the-white-horse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1886741.Der_Schimmelreiter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15920311-der-schimmelreiter-cd", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21269364-the-rider-on-the-white-horse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31296012-der-schimmelreiter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17302611-hayalet-s-vari", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28959958-skimmelrytteren", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2449725.The_Rider_of_the_White_Horse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3942497-immensee", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1330150.Pole_Poppensp_ler", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2331570.Immensee_und_andere_Novellen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1771018.Aquis_Submersus", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2134882.Hans_und_Heinz_Kirch"]}
