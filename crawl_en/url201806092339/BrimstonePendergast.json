(Another reason I haven\u2019t busted out okra or polenta, incidentally, because eating those things just seems ridiculous. I refuse.)Fortunately, the stars aligned well in this instance\u2014I\u2019ve been housing a ton of pizza lately, which seems apropos for a book set, at least in part, in Italy. Here\u2019s the thing about pizza, though: pizza quality can vary wildly, not unlike the multiple storylines within this book (see what I did there?).See, sometimes you get John\u2019s of Bleecker Street, some of the most sublime pie you\u2019ve ever had. The method of the murderer (did the devil REALLY do it??), the historical backdrop in Italy, the burgeoning friendship between Pendergast and D\u2019Agosta\u2026these are the tastiest parts of the story, and worthy of what you\u2019d get in that fabled West Village pizzeria. (For those of you wrinkling your faces because you\u2019re Chicago-style fans, just sub in the word \u201cGino\u2019s\u201d for John\u2019s, okay? I won\u2019t judge or argue.)Other parts of the story, though, are more like your favorite local pizza joint\u2014good, sure, but , unless you live in New York (or Chicago), you\u2019re probably getting something that is perfectly satisfying, but not the best you\u2019ve ever had. That\u2019s other elements of the story: the weird preacher in the park subplot, the wacky supporting characters, and Pendergast\u2019s entertaining but often absurd knack for getting out of impossible situations. Then, of course, there\u2019s freezer pizza. Which, let\u2019s face it, is barely pizza, but it\u2019s what you eat if you NEED something pizza-like and have no other option at 3 AM. In this case, that\u2019s the semi-icky romance between D\u2019Agosta and Hayward, the occasionally clunky dialogue, and most aspects of the villain (who I won\u2019t say anything about to avoid spoilers). (Incidentally, I\u2019m ignoring things like the pizza they serve in elementary school cafeterias, which the FDA has determined is not, in fact, pizza, but is actually a corpse hand covered in mozzarella-flavored cheez food snack product. There are no circumstances under which it should be given to a growing child for whom nutrition is paramount, unless one is grooming said child to be a flesh-eating zombie, in which case it is acceptable, but less preferable than almost any other form of decaying human body parts.)I\u2019ve said it before, and I\u2019ll say it again: Preston and Child are as technically proficient a pair of thriller writers as there is on the market, so even when they stretch in different directions (occasionally a little awkwardly) in an effort to broaden the canvas on which they can paint this series, they don\u2019t lose sight of what they came to do, which is write an entertaining page turner that never lets up. Worth a read if you\u2019re a fan of the series, but definitely start with the predecessors before you jump into this one.(One note on Pendergast: he continues to evolve into more of an action hero, moving beyond his Sherlockian roots to become something more akin to a highly intelligent and eccentric James Bond in this book, albeit Bond mixed with a shirtless, drawling Matthew McConaughey. It\u2019s odd. Yet, compelling.)"}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "There are not enough stars in the world for Preston and Child!

Brimstone is somewhat different from its predecessors. It's more Agatha Christie than Michael Crichton this time round. A little bit less horror; a little more mystery. The authors appear to be paying tribute to a number of literary classics and conventions in this novel. For one thing, one of the characters is lifted exactly out of The Woman in White. Aloysius Pendergast has always been decidedly Sherlock Holmes-like, but it's taken to the next level here, with Vincent D'Agosta acting out the Dr. Watson parts. Heck, I even detected a bit of Ian Fleming. So, it's a bit of a mish-mash of sorts, but it's all good. In fact, it's really, really good. It's clear that the authors have been consciously trying to prevent the series from becoming too formulaic and predictable. Every novel brings a new dimension to the table and Brimstone is no exception. Think you can predict what's going on? Think again. Some things have remained constant though, such as the thrills and suspense we have come to expect. Recalling Mbwun from Relic, the 'surgeon' from The Cabinet of Curiosities, and let's not even talk about the oh so atmospheric Still Life with Crows, I can't help but wonder when these guys are going to start running out of ideas, or variety. Fortunately, with Brimstone it hasn't happened yet.Brimstone is the first in the Diogenes trilogy and we are fleetingly introduced to a creepy fellow (now you see him, now you don't) who may or may not be Pendergast's evil brother, Diogenes. As such, the novel ends on a bit of a cliffhanger. You'll want Dance of Death close at hand.It's exciting stuff. I can't recommend this series enough."}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8575414-emma", "userReview": "Pendergast for President!

I\u2019ve been really impressed with this series and the writers. Preston/Child have tackled lots of different plots and they have all worked so far.This book in the series, Brimstone starts off with a charred body found in a Long Island estate. The questions about the death seem to involve evil forces with the smell of brimstone in the air and a hoofprint scorched into the floor.Did Satan really kill this man?!! Well, read this book to find out.This book travels from Long Island to New York City and then to the historic and ancient city of Florence, Italy. I loved all the details of the city of Florence along with the art and history references.I enjoyed where the authors took the character of Vincent D\u2019Agosta in this book along with giving more family history on Aloysius Pendergast. Laura Hayward from Reliquary was also in the book. I really love this character and hope to see more of her in the future!If you enjoy thrillers, horror or suspense, then this book and series is right up your wheelhouse!

Like many other Pendergast novels, sometimes it seems like the story is Paranormally focused, but by the end that's not always the case. I won't say whether it is or isn't this time around, just like Relic and Still Life with Crows, things are usually more than they initially seem, even if what they initially seem is already downright fascinating without adding more plot point brownie points on top.The creepy atmosphere is well-maintained, although it dwindles down into more of a whodunnit. Finally at the end it almost feels like a spy action-adventure novel. The authors are excellent at weaving up interesting, complex storylines that borrow a little of this and that from various genres. Even Pendergast himself feels little like James Bond. Really there isn't anyone else out there like him, which makes the stories seem even more unique, but you can pick up other far-out there traits shared with other detectives. While the book starts strong, it stays fascinating, but the ending is a little weak in comparison to the rest of the book. Usually the endings of these are showstoppers, so this was a little surprising.Pendergast doesn't go as far out into Super-Pendergast territory as some of his previous novels, and we get returning characters such as Vincent D'Agosta. This was a treat since I always loved the guy, although he's now had major changes in his life and has to deal with demotion, depression, and self-doubt. It was interesting seeing him deal with his issues and getting a new lease on life, thanks to the supportive friendliness of our pale crusader. While the fifth in a series, it's also the first of a trilogy focusing on the mystery of Pendergast's long-lost and apparently twisted, evil brother Diogenes.Overall another psychologically gripping story, but in this case I kind of wish more of a supernatural bend would have come into play. Outstanding characters, well-placed tension, and groovy atmosphere support it up against any weight of plot pitfalls though, so this is another one highly recommended in the long-running series."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4086118-michael", "userReview": "I had some thrills with this one, the 5th in a series of 12. A mysterious death of a hated Manhattan art critic is judged as caused by internal heating, and a cloven hoof print and bit of brimstone at the scene raise the specter of the Devil\u2019s work. FBI agent Prendergast and police liaison Sergeant D\u2019Agosta make a team similar to Holmes and Watson. The victim\u2019s guests and telephone calls made the night of his death have overtones of a man who has made a pact with the Devil fearful of payback time. A second grisly death gets the public worried, fanned by a doomsday preachers. A scholar they contact has identified a temporal pattern in history including the volcanic explosion behind the myth of Atlantis and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah that predicts the end times in this year of 2004. You know the good guys will deflate all this spooky, mystical fluff and dispel the nightmare in favor of some fiendish, but human, criminal enterprise. And it\u2019s kind of fun to follow the steps they take to get there from small clues. Eventually, after a number of dead ends and narrow escapes, they are led to Florence. I was quite disappointed how our fearless duo never succeed in preventing the deaths that are part of a pattern and how most of the mysteries of the murders are revealed to them by the bad guy when finally cornered. Yet Prendergast claims he knew much about the motivation from a horse hair found at one crime scene. I liked this one better than its successor, \u201cDance of Death\u201d, but not quite as well \u201cCabinet of Curiosities\u201d. For escapist fare, they satisfy my periodic craving for slightly absurd, somewhat Gothic thrillers where heroic brain and brawn are challenged to the max."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Dec 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6755739-mark", "userReview": "The best reason for rereading a good book is when you switch from a dog-eared paperback copy to a first edition hardcover copy, so I did just that.The book begins with a crime scene that clearly shows that the devil has taken care of the victim. This of course tickles a certain FBI agents interest and when he finds a certain former NYPD lieutenant Vincent in the humbly job of police sergeant at the same scene life is good for Vincent who suddenly becomes a liaison for the local police department and the FBI. When a second dead occurs that looks like the Devil visited a second sinner the religious read a message in that and they have their own agenda to fulfill.In the meantime Pendergast and Vincent are pursuing their own investigation that is a heck more down to earth. It does take them from New York to the Bella Italia where everything either ends or just starts heating up. A first installment in a trilogy of books that does end on some sort of cliffhanger, which makes you read on. the fact that this book is written by messieurs Preston & Child makes it an easy choice, of course you will continue.For the fans of Dan Brown there is plenty of brilliant Italy and the art and history to be enjoyed, only a lot better written by two writers that were just getting started with the Pendergast tales.Well advised to be read."}, {"userName": "kartik narayanan", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4070035-kartik-narayanan", "userReview": "Brimstone starts off promisingly but putters out towards the end.

Preston & Child have used this book to set up a 'Moriarty' for Pendergast or is that a Mycroft? ;-).

After reading a few of them, I'm not sure why.Two dimensional comic book characters (and not in a good way), over-wrought plots, unbelievable exploits, yadda yadda.Probably the most fundamental criticism I can make regards their craft. They consistently tell us about the amazing abilities of Diogenes and Pendergast rather than showing them to us. They seem to want to set up Pendergast as a modern Holmes - Mycroft even - and yet their descriptions of his abilities boil down to magic. \"And then through his amazing intellectual abilities, Pendergast saw the solution: 'Aha!' he exclaimed. 'Follow me!' This isn't a direct quote but you see this pattern throughout the Pendergast novels. Similarly they might describe a fight intended to illustrate Pendergast's amazing martial arts skills as follows: \"Pendergasts movement blurred and his opponent fell to his feet unconscious. 'Anyone else?'\" We might as well be reading Batman issue #1, here. \"Through his amazing super-science, Batman analyzes the crime scene and identifies his culprit.\"Also, they make no attempt to make the elements of their stories remotely believable. In Brimstone, for instance, they invent some kind of microwave weapon that you cart about like a bazooka and melt people in their homes. In another story they invent a young lady who has lived an extraordinarily long life and yet remains essentially a pre-adolescent. These elements could have been handled in a credible way - that is, we could have been persuaded to suspend disbelief - but as it is, they are literal comic-book devices, no more intriguing than the Super-Villain of the week back in the Silver Age of comics.I read this book shortly after reading Jasper Fforde's lampoons of detective fiction - the Nursery Crimes series. I burst out laughing as soon as Pendergast appeared on the scene. A master of disguise, with a sidekick, a bizarrely expensive and impractical classic car, and an unpronouncable name.Child and Prestons work on these characters was momentarily diverting but ultimately a waste of time and money. Now don't get me wrong - I *love* comic books, from the classic (and ultimately poorly written) characters to the most innovative thing created today. But a novel isn't a comic book and the worst comic book I've read this year beats this.Jeeze - enough with the negative reviews - gotta post something I like."}, {"userName": "\u2728Susan\u2728", "userReviewDate": "Jul 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21276121-susan", "userReview": "I have liked other books in this series very much but I had a hard time getting into this one.

One overlookable flaw was an unnecessary side plot involving an ex-felon doomsday preacher who improbably sets up a grimy tent city in Central Park and gets hundreds (or maybe it was thousands) of New Yorkers to follow him as if he's a modern Messiah. Um, right. This felt like it was imported from a bad Tom Wolfe novel. A second flaw is the introduction of several high-society characters at the outset, who then are immediately abandoned. A third flaw is the authors' outright theft of Count Fosco, plucked, white mice and all, from Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White. The authors pretend to apologize for this in an afterword, claiming that \"today [the novel] is well-nigh forgotten\" - ridiculously, of course, because The Woman in White was and is much more widely read than even Preston & Child's biggest selling bestsellers. (The Woman in White has 105,780 Goodreads ratings, versus 75,080 for P & C's The Relic, and 28,128 for Brimstone.) Fourthly, there is some cringiness in the way Pendergast meets and is instantly smitten by Lady Viola Maskelene, who will appear in subsequent novels. With a character as odd as Pendergast I think you need to write his emotions as awkward and stumbling, not suave. No one wants to read a scene where he takes a woman's hand and time stops and the world suddenly rotates on a different axis. Fifthly, I don't understand how Pendergast's face can \"drain of color\" when he is albino to begin with. \"As D'Agosta watched, Pendergast grew pale.\" \"D'Agosta was startled to see Pendergast go pale as he took the envelope.\" It's time to find a new way for Pendergast to look startled or frightened, authors! Maybe his nearly-white hair can stand on end.Overall, though, Preston and Child's bulbous wet glistening mounds served them fairly well in this Faust-themed novel. By that, I mean their brains. Even though, regrettably, their bulbous wet glistening mounds could not seem to refrain from constantly referencing police captain Laura Hayward's breasts (as happened in earlier novels as well). These breasts were large, even enormous. Several characters in this book and others referred to them multiple times as a \"set of knockers.\" This is a phrase that emanated from Preston and Child's bulbous wet glistening mounds. As Preston and Child sat at their computers, their penises in their trousers - possibly engorged and erect, ramrod straight - or perhaps lying flaccid, limp and inactive, nestled like new babes in mangers - who knows which? - their bulbous wet glistening mounds constantly reflected on the size of Laura Hayward's mammaries even though this had no bearing on the story. Laura Hayward was not a stripper, an exotic dancer, a model, not a wet nurse. She was a police captain. Her uniform was not revealing of her chest or other body parts. Yet the bulbous wet glistening mounds of the authors, as they sat penis-equipped writing their novels, insisted that Laura Hayward's breasts must be emphasized in every description of Laura Hayward. This flaw I could not overlook."}, {"userName": "Jovana Vesper", "userReviewDate": "Apr 01, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15087190-jovana-vesper", "userReview": "Bo\u017ee, daj svima zdravlja i sre\u0107e a meni \u0161esti nastavak Preston/\u010cajld romana!Obo\u017eavam ovu fran\u0161izu, to je i slepim mi\u0161evima u mom dvori\u0161tu jasno.

I thought that the book was simply fantastic and extremely delectable, and the moment I finished it I felt a deep hunger to pounce on the next, if I had the sixth book in my possession I have no doubt that I would be unable to leave it alone. Meticulously researched, the novel travels from the streets of New York into the lush and romantic Italy, where Pendergast meets with a nemesis so grand, evil and intense that everyone has little doubt about it being the devil himself. I adore that these books have an aura of enigmatic and mystical proportions, anything is possible and everything somehow has an explanation.The book is quite long but a lot of things happen and the chases, the intrigue and the clues take up a lot of time, making the entire story feel alive and throbbing with anticipation of what happens next. My favorite literary crush, FBI Special Agent Aloysius Pendergast is fabulous as usual, with plenty of tricks up his sleeves ( literally) and with his senses heightened to take on this hard challenge he takes charge at solving another unusual crime while risking his life. When a famous art critic dies under strange circumstances Pendergast doesn't tale long to start connecting small clues, they form into a cluster of horrifying secrets and involved more people who seem to die in similar fashion before anyone can get to them. There's a connection between the strange, rich people and the hellish ways in which they perished, but the closer they agent gets to the truth the more obstacles appear on his way, seems that not only is the devil out to get him but the mortals involved in protecting the secrets are as ruthless and vicious as they come. His research takes him and former NYPD officer Vincent D'Agosta to monasteries, castles and catacombs of ancient Italians, where the secrets are gravely guarded and finding the truth is tougher than anyone could have expected.

If you are not familiar with Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child or you are new to the horror genre, then you need to read these authors and especially their series on Pendergast as you will not be disappointed. These authors know how to weave a story and pull you into their world! This book gets a five star rating!"}, {"userName": "Tiffany PSquared", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27443399-tiffany-psquared", "userReview": "I already loved the Relic/Pendergast series and reading this book may have sealed my dedication to it ad infinitum with the introduction (sort of) of bad boy, Diogenes.I love the way Pendergast and D'Agosta play off of each other.

It was ok, I liked it more than the first Pendergast novel Relic. I just expected a better ending. For the most part I like the character Pendergast. He is the type of Agent that you want to follow because he has this James Bond style confidence, while is also not afraid to push the boundaries to get information he needs. This book is a good stand alone novel. Having only read the first Perdergast novel I was concerned that I would be lost. A friend of mine recommended this to me and said it was a good one, so I decided to give it a try. There were references between characters that I didn't know because I haven't read the other books, but it was nothing that caused me to be lost. This book also alludes to a separate character arc by introducing Pendergast's brother. This was such a small mention around the middle and end of the book that it also didn't matter to the story at all. The plot itself did sound like it could be really interesting, summoning the Devil who kills those who brought him forward. I kept wondering how this was going to be explained. There had to be some logical explanation but I couldn't think of how Preston and Child where going to handle it. When finally I came to the explanation I was disappointed. I even said out loud \"that's it!!!\" With all the satanic innuendo, and unexplainable ways the murders where happening I felt there should have been a more impressive ending. I will leave it at that so I don't spoil anything if you haven't read it, but I was expecting something more spectacular. Overall, not a terrible book. I do like the characters, but I felt the story was lacking in this one. I do plan on reading more of the Pendergast series at some point, but so far out of the two I have read, I am not overly impressed."}, {"userName": "Andrew Sydlik", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1442089-andrew-sydlik", "userReview": "Fifth Pendergast book, first in the \"Diogenes trilogy,\" although Pendergast's diabolical brother hardly appears in this at all, so I don't understand why it is lumped with the next 2 books. Anyway, it is pretty typical of the Pendergast series - fast-paced action, mysterious crimes, a blend of science and the spiritual.I like the complexity of the mystery and Pendergast's eccentricities, which remind me of Poe's detective stories. However, some of the narrative seems unnecessary, such as the sections that follow the reporter and the preacher. While interesting, they drag the pace.The characters are too often formulaic - e.g., the police captain, a beautiful woman (she isn't just smart and in a good career, she has good looks, too, as the authors are important to note) in an unprecedented position of authority (see also the ocean liner captain in \"Wheel of Darkness\"); the down-on-his-luck guy turned hero (Vinnie D'Agosta, who somehow turns from overweight loser to sexy and skilled hero within a matter of days).While the characters and events stretch credibility, and the authors' expositions on upper-class culture (painting and opera in this book) can be grating, it is a fun read. The more I think about Pendergast's abilities, though, the more his success seems just as much due to luck than his own skill. This book does end unusually, with Pendergast seemingly killed off (though of course by now we know that he came through alive).This is another entry showing that while the Pendergast novels aren't masterpieces, they are fun and mysterious."}, {"userName": "Alison", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3189735-alison", "userReview": "This is the first book I've ready by Douglas Preston and I'm ready to read more. Agent Pendergast is quite a character, a little of James Bond, a little of David Copperfield, and little like a cat with nine lives - which all makes it that much more interesting to read on to discover how he's going to get out of all the scrapes he gets into! Spontaneous Human Combustion? The Devil? are two of the theories put out there when a body is discovered burnt although nothing else in the house has been touched by fire, save a hoof print found burned into the wood floor. When the autopsy proves the victim has been burned fron the inside of his body the case gets real interesting. Of course, actually finding brimstone around the corpse adds mystic. And then, another victim in found, also having been burnt from the inside out. The mystery has FBI Agent Pendergast working with local police and some mighty unsavory suspects and witnesses. Agent Pendergast seems to have an angel at his back as he escapes one mess to another. But, how long can his luck hold out? There are a cast of characters that lend color and intrigue to this mystery. A new writer for me, one that I enjoyed reading."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6899594-alex", "userReview": "Great book! Solid 4.5 stars. The duo really has a way of fusing together both great dialogue and descriptive setting with a solid plot. There were several action scenes that had me on the edge of my seat, reminding me of the greatest action novels I've read - Dan Brown, Max McCoy, Patterson, and even other Preston/Child books. Great plot, per usual, and plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing what will happen next.

I admit that partly, it was my fault for not reading in order, but it wasn't only this.The novel set off to amazing start, becoming of all the Pendergast series. Plus, D'Agosta has always been one of my favourites and I was glad to have him here. The investigation started good and was getting better with every chapter. No doubt, my most favourite thing about these novels is how the story balances between the realistic and the paranormal, crossing the border just a bit from time to time.A nice surprise was now fully was covered the romance between Vincent and Laura. Actually, this must be the most romantic book of the series. :DBack to the point. There were some moments I was anticipating, but sadly I was rather disappointed. Especially about Constance entering - my expectations were based on the fourth book - and I was in for something better, and creepier. But it was so skipped over, at one point I thought I must had missed a book. Anyway, thing kind of kept it till the middle of the book, but when the main story line moved to Italy, my interest was lost. I didn't like how the story was going and how the mystery was unfolding. Gone was as well the trill of how the crime was performed.The story telling moved often back to New York, where captain Hayward was left to deal with all the mess. But for this side of the story I cared even less. It wasn't that bad, but by then I've grown tired of the \"crowd control\" theme, especially coupled with the incompetent police response. We've seen this already in the Reliquary and we'll see it again in Cemetery dance. You guessed it right, I read Cemetery dance beforehand, but still. I am pretty sure the authors could've come with something better than reusing a motif from the second book and fill what felt like more than half of the book with it.In short - I just lost interest and that was all. And even all the castle secrets, love sparkles and Diogen shadows couldn't bring it back.Maybe if I've read this book in its proper place, I'd rate it higher, but actually I doubt it. Before Brimstone are Cabinet of curiosities and Still life with crows - two of my favourites of the series, and for Brimstone to stand in their shadow would do it no good."}, {"userName": "Juli", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli", "userReview": "From the wealthy mansions of the Hamptons to crumbling ancient castles in Italy, Agent Pendergast investigates the strange Faust-like death of Art Critic Jeremy Grove. Grove's body, discovered in a locked room, is strangely burned, as if it burned from the inside out. Pendergast joins forces with two police officers he has worked with before: Vincent D'Agosta and Laura Heywood. As other bodies are found, similarly burned, the three investigators try to unravel the mystery. Is the devil himself coming to Earth to claim these men? If not, how are the bodies being burned, and who is behind the killings?I love the Agent Pendergast series. Each novel is creepy and thrilling. Brimstone is the 5th novel in the Pendergast series. I listened to the audiobook version of this book. The narrator was Actor Rene Auberjonois. He did a wonderful job, reading clearly and using proper accents for Pendergast (New Orleans southern drawl), the east coast, and Italian characters. I have hearing loss, but was easily able to hear and understand all parts of this audiobook. This story was another awesome Agent Pendergast thriller. The idea that Satan himself might be coming to collect on debts owed by nefarious, greedy characters was intriguing. The mystery had many twists and turns. I didn't see the ending coming....the tale ends on a wonderfully chilling final twist. I'm definitely going to be reading more of this series. It's creepy-cool without being overly gory or cheesy. The books are well-written and the plots are complex but entertaining. I recommend this series for readers who like supernatural thrillers and action/adventure. There are 16 books in the Agent Pendergast series. Douglas Preston and Lincoln Child are also the authors of many other books.

I've not read the others in the series and only have dim memories of prior events.The plot is fairly ridiculous, with a potential involvement of the devil rapidly becoming obviously not satanic in nature, though still remaining pretty out-there in terms of ludicrousness. The motivation seems so unlikely that you have to laugh: they really went to all that trouble for that..? There's an entirely superflous subplot involving a preacher and a journalist that drags the page count ever higher. Pendergast is too clever for his own good and seems to make some pretty wild yet correct leaps of thought: a horsehair resolves the entire plot for Pendergast (even on re-reading it doesn't really seem plausible). There's also a few weird errors for something that seems heavily 'researched' (they mention a character playing 'snooker' in a billiard room using only red and white balls - well that's billiards).Despite all that I actually quite enjoyed it. Pendergast and D'Agosta joined together make a fun combination and it's a quick (though long) read. The action scenes, especially the finale are grand in scope and it just borders on the bizarre enough to be fun. If I found the other books for the same price I would happily fork out $5 but I'm not going to purposefully hunt them down."}], "description": "Art critic Jeremy Grove is found dead, his face frozen in a mask of terror. His body temperature is grotesquely high; he is discovered in a room barricaded from the inside; the smell of brimstone is everywhere...and the unmistakable imprint of a claw is burned into the wall. As more bodies are discovered - their only connection the bizarre but identical manner of death - the world begins to wonder if the Devil has, is fact, come to collect his due. Teaming with Police Officer Vincent D'Agosta, Agent Pendergast is determined to solve this case that appears to defy all logic. Their investigation takes them from the luxury estates of Long Island to the crumbling, legend-shrouded castles of the Italian countryside, where Pendergast faces the most treacherous and dangerous adversary of his career.", "title": "Brimstone\n      \n          (Pendergast #5)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21984.Brimstone", "average": 4.13, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1386912264l/21984.jpg", "reviews": 1052, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/12577.Douglas_Preston", "name": "Douglas Preston"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11091.Lincoln_Child", "name": "Lincoln Child"}, {"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/44554.Scott_Brick", "name": "Scott Brick"}], "type": ["Horror", "Suspense", "Thriller", "Thriller", "Mystery"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21984.Brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/136637.Brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/454535.Brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7224922-brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1010476.Brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22017310-brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18453264-brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7153661-enxofre", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21978.Brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7099546-brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13368813-brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/669111.Brimstone", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/67035.Relic", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39031.The_Cabinet_of_Curiosities", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39030.Reliquary", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30068.The_Book_of_the_Dead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39033.Still_Life_With_Crows"]}
