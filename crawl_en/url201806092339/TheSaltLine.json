The burrowing appendage, which is called the horn, is corkscrew shaped. The female essentially drills into your skin, pulling her body behind her into the opening. This takes less than half a minute. By the time you feel the itching, the female miner tick has created a tiny cavity under your skin and settled into place. I cannot stress to you enough the importance of quick action here. Within a few minutes, the female will start releasing eggs into the cavity. The eggs are each the size of a pinprick. They can\u2019t move on their own, but they\u2019re covered in a fibrous coating, which makes them exceptionally sticky, like burrs. They spread out quickly and can even enter the bloodstream.\u201d\u2026\u201cIf the itching stops, you\u2019re fucked. The female has died, and the eggs have scattered. Over the next several hours, the area around the bite will erupt in hundreds of pustules. Depending on where the eggs traveled, and if evacuation occurred near a vein, eruptions can occur all over the body, and even in vital organs. The itching will return and become almost unbearable. If you don\u2019t scratch the pustules open yourself to try to sooth the itch, the miner ticks will eventually tear their way out.\u201dand that\u2019s just the best-case scenario. if that burrowing tick is carrying the dreaded shreve\u2019s disease, the human/tick incubator will be dead within days, after paralysis and having to watch hundreds of baby ticks explode with glee out of their own pustule-covered body.this, friends, this is why i read books. it's such scary, buggy awesomeness. i also want to read this: Containment, which has the same general premise, but looks like more of a breezy action book than a literary exploration of the sitch.because this book is definitely a literary treatment, not the LOOK OUT FOR BUGGAS kind of slant that something like The Hatching provides. it\u2019s compared to both Station Eleven and California, and all three are all post-event stories centered around survival, but The Salt Line is a much closer match to California. Station Eleven is very much about the broad scope of humanity and cultural legacy and community, while this one and California are more narrowly focused on the experiences of individuals within the wasteland. alliances exist and new alliances form throughout the story, but even when characters are emotionally connected here, they are still very much alone and their decisions and motivations are frequently withheld from other characters. like California, there\u2019s also a particular emphasis on motherhood, whether it\u2019s biological, informally adopting an orphan, situationally maternal relationships, characters undergoing fertility treatments or who have chosen abortion, as well as some insight on the new-world regulations for that particular option. and for the first 3/4, it was pretty fantastic: i loved the dread of a life-ending threat being contained within such a tiny, easy-to-overlook creature (and lemme just say - i brought this book with me when i was visiting my dad deep in the woods of maine, which i assume are teeming with ticks, hoping my surroundings would make it even more terrifying), i loved the tension of relying on the reflexes, bravery and general competence of one individual (who might be a complete stranger, in the case of marta and wes), to intervene if a tick went a-burrowing inside of you, i loved many of the twists and reveals and even though it wasn\u2019t the \u201csurvival in the wilderness\u201d story i\u2019d anticipated, i was digging what it was becoming, and i definitely appreciated june who was like a badass deanna monroe in my mindbut without zombies. and yet, for all that i did enjoy, i had a hard time following some of the later developments and i got tangled up in the various plots and counterplots. not so much in terms of \u201cwhat happened,\u201d but more in the necessity of these things happening - the motivation behind them. one of these \u201cthings\u201d was a disproportionately destructive reaction to an easily-subdued threat, and in a world with so little left, it seems unlikely that someone who had survived/flourished under such extreme circumstances for so long would have been so successful without considering the long game. i\u2019m dancing around all the nouns right now, but there were a couple of things like that particular vague example that had high-dramatic value but weren\u2019t all that logical, so i got all caught up in trying to follow the cause-and-effect line, which pulled me out of simply enjoying the book.but i guess not enough to ruin it for me, so i'm going to rest on my four-star rating because star rating precision never troubles me too much, and i tend to give out a lot of four-stars as a result.this is a lowish four, if anyone's doing the math on it. definitely worth reading. ***********************************************oh, man - this book is getting CRAAAAZZYYYY. but awesome. i wish i wasn't about to fall asleep so i could read all night long..."}, {"userName": "Sh3lly \u2694 tired of damaged heroines \u2694", "userReviewDate": "Aug 29, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25393430-sh3lly-tired-of-damaged-heroines", "userReview": "Review also found at the Dust Off Your MacHalo blog.ALL THE STARS! One of my favorite new releases of 2017! How to describe this book? Well, first of all, it's got burrowing ticks in it! But, this is not a horror story. Yes, there are a few gross parts, but overall, it's a post-apocalyptic setting in the future, where diseases carried by \"miner ticks\" have turned society into \"zones.\" Inside the zones, you're pretty safe, but more restricted, and the government kind of lies about a few things.Outside the zones, well, you aren't really supposed to know anything exists out there. It's DANGEROUS. Stay where it's safe!Inevitably, \"excursion\" groups pop up for filthy rich elites, where they suit up, and go \"camping\" for a few weeks and get to see how people used to live... old houses, grocery stores, star-gazing, gasoline-fueled, cars, etc. One thing to keep in mind is that this is NOT a horror story. You do see some tick action, but it's not the main focus. It's about the people who go on this excursion and what happens to them and discovering things out there aren't what they have been told.I LOVED the various stories of the people focused on. You have Edie, who is this 20-something who happened to end up with a filthy rich pop star of the month guy. She's the bartender/waitress who got the celebrity and wonders how she got there. Edie is awesome!You have Marta, the wife of a mafia type guy, who has turned a blind eye for decades... for her sons. I won't go into how she ends up on the \"tour,\" but this lady... ALL THE FEELS. There is some major girl power going on in this book. Strong female characters.You have Violet, a horribly facially-scarred 30-something who ends up being so much more than she starts out being. I won't go into her story either because spoilers! Wes is the billionaire wonder-kid (well, he is in his 20s in this) who came up with some brilliant program like Facebook, only it's called Pocketz. He is a vegan, has a bit of OCD, is very controlled yet inexperienced in a way, and his story surprises you.There are a few more supporting characters, but those are the ones who stood out the most to me and we flash back and forth between their POVs. This has a few WTF and weird didn't-see-that-coming moments.I also really enjoyed the underlying various messages on motherhood. Each female has a totally different view on it and it seems to flow poignantly in the background throughout the book.To me (this is just my view, don't quote me on this), it has vibes of The Last One and The Book of the Unnamed Midwife. I think this has enough sci-fi and suspense to appeal to those who like that in books and yet it also has enough aspects of \"regular\" fiction to appeal to those who don't like as much fantasy.I highly recommend and just devoured this pretty much in one day. I just loved the characterization, the plot, and yes, the dystopian and fantasy moments. Digital copy provided by Netgalley and publisher to read and review.

Extreme thrill seekers can still venture out beyond the protection into the wild by paying a high sum to an adventure company. The company then trains the adventure seekers as to what to expect beyond the salt line and how to fend in the wild. The latest group of adventure seekers have teamed up and trained to go out into nature on their adventure but what awaited them was more than they ever would have expected when the deadly disease-carrying ticks become the least of their worries. Ambushed by a group with guns the wealthy travelers are taken hostage and find themselves captives in Ruby City, a community made up of outer-zone survivors that none of them knew existed. The Salt Line by Holly Goddard Jones is a book that I honestly expected to fall in love with but in the end ended up thinking this one was just an OK read. There were things in here that I really liked such as the plot in which the ticks have gotten so bad that people are hiding in safe areas. I mean come on, who hasn't seen on the news lately that ticks are even more dangerous these days, between the ticks and mosquito stories one would think maybe we do need burned out insect free areas. But the author took the story beyond that initial fear and went into much more so it actually had a bit more depth in that regard than I was expecting. But as for the downside to this one I don't think that I was a huge fan of the style in which the story was written. The author chose to follow multiple characters and even the further you got there are more characters that are brought into the book and more drama piled on so there was a bit of a disconnect as far as connecting with any specific person or people on a deeper level. I also thought that the flashing back to learn of what led characters to get to where they were in the story didn't always flow well the way it was done. Not that any of this made the book terrible, just ended up being one that I wasn't totally in love with when finished.

Several of the people on the tour are actually there because of ulterior motives rather than tourism but everyone's plans go awry when the tour starts to go wrong.Fantastic world-building with a post ecological collapse world, oppressive government and a thriving criminal element and all with the ever present threat of the ticks. The characters are fantastic too, including Wes, a tech billionaire looking for a purpose, Edie, a bartender with a rich and famous boyfriend and Marta, a matronly figure married to a mob boss. The setup is intricate, and the twists shocking when they come, with constant pacing and fascinating outcomes.The book also has a lot to say about inter-dependency, trust and motivation as well as desperation and loyalty. A minor but important part of all that is the various dependence setups that women suffer largely due to biology. From Edie's unwanted pregnancy in a place where abortion is \"feticide\" \"punished like any first degree murder\" to problems faced by the women of a community later in the book.This book is complete, but there is ample material for a sequel which should be very interesting to see."}, {"userName": "Mogsy (MMOGC)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4379514-mogsy-mmogc", "userReview": "4 of 5 stars at The BiblioSanctum https://bibliosanctum.com/2017/09/28/...It\u2019s a year for pleasant surprises, it seems. The Salt Line is a book that first caught my eye because of its thriller-dystopian premise, but it\u2019s more than just that; author Holly Goddard Jones has created an exciting high-drama experience, the kind that would not go amiss in a Crichton novel, but her story also contains a high level of literary quality that challenges most genre labels.Taking place in the not-so-distant future, The Salt Line features a world defeated by an enemy smaller than the size of a pea. The United States has even ceded most of its natural territories to this tiny terror, a tick that serves a as a vector to a deadly pathogen. Getting bit by one of these things is scary enough\u2014their life cycle and what it does to the human body is like something straight out of an Alien movie\u2014but the true killer is in fact Shreve\u2019s disease, carried by a large percent of these ticks. For this reason, most people now live in safe zones in which these pests have been eradicated. These enclosed areas are separated from the wilderness, which is where the ticks thrive, by a physical wall as well as a burnt-out dead zone called the Salt Line, a large swath of land that has been purged of all life by fire and chemicals designed to keep the ticks at bay.Still, there are people who live beyond the Salt Line\u2014some by choice, others by necessity. Then there are the thrill-seekers who pay big money for their chance to go out there, to have a grand adventure to see what\u2019s left of nature. Our story begins with such a group, receiving their first orientation from the tour company that\u2019s being paid to bring them outside the quarantine zone. Those among the expedition include Edie, a former bartender in her 20s who somehow ended being roped into this dangerous excursion by Jesse, her reckless popstar boyfriend. Then there\u2019s Marta, who may seem like just a simple housewife, except she is actually married to a notorious robber baron whose illicit activities she has endured for years because of her love for her children. And of course there\u2019s also Wes, a young billionaire tech prodigy who founded Pocketz, the financial app that has taken the world by storm.Most of the people on this tour are there because of what the company brochure promised\u2014a chance to experience the untouched beauty of nature. For some, being able to witness sparkling waterfalls and sunrises without the filter of pollution is worth the hundreds of thousands of dollars and the risk of death from a tick bite. But for those mentioned, they have other reasons for wanting to take this trip. And when the expedition is waylaid by a group of rebels and held captive in an outer-zone commune called Ruby City, those secrets begin to come to light, with dire consequences for their chances of returning home.The unofficial tagline for this book should be The Salt Line: come for the creepy ticks, stay for outstanding characterization and the in-depth exploration of social themes. Those who want suspense and intrigue will get plenty, but there\u2019s no doubt that the novel\u2019s strength is in its rich, character-driven narrative and fantastically written cast. Our key players are all fleshed out with robust back stories, complete with their individual moral dilemmas, conflicting desires, and other very human concerns (I especially loved Marta and Wes). They also come from varied backgrounds, representing the different strata of this troubled society with its extreme socio-economical class divisions. The arrival of the deadly ticks has altered daily life at all levels, impacting issues related to the environment, healthcare, immigration, technology, and more. Though the price of safety and security is high, many appear willing to pay it even if it means being trapped in poor circumstances.Still, despite its social commentary, I appreciated the way our story maintained its focus on adventure and suspense. Love them or hate them, the characters are at the heart of this novel, and the ambiguities behind their ambitions are the fuel that drives the plot, keeping things engaging. All this and more are presented in a seamless package containing a fine balance of horror, dystopian, and thriller elements.Would I recommend The Salt Line for fans of dystopian fiction? Yes, but with an added proviso that this genre description merely scratches the book\u2019s surface\u2014a good thing, in my opinion. I got a lot more out of the story than I expected, and enjoyed spending every tense moment in this world with its multifaceted characters. I wouldn\u2019t hesitate to read another novel by Holly Goddard Jones in the future."}, {"userName": "Cindy Burnett", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2445617-cindy-burnett", "userReview": "3.5 \u2013 4 starsI absolutely loved the concept of this book and mostly enjoyed the implementation. The publisher\u2019s description mentioned that The Salt Line would appeal to those who liked Station Eleven and for once I felt that suggestion was actually accurate. But even more than Station Eleven, the story reminded me of The Hunger Games but without the battle to the death component. In The Salt Line, an aggressive tick, which carries a deadly virus about 20% of the time, has invaded the United States. Much like The Hunger Games, the United States no longer exists as we know it and instead much of the population is living in Zones, some wealthier than others. The main characters of The Salt Line live in the Atlantic Zone and are surrounded by a large wall, an electric field, and chemically treated wasteland to prevent the ticks, and other people, from entering. The people within the walls are heavily controlled by a government that uses fear as its main method of rule and grants little privacy to its residents.The main plot of the book revolves around an excursion company that offers pricy, adrenaline fueled trips outside the Salt Line. The main characters embark on such an excursion, and of course almost as soon as they head out, the trip is derailed. To avoid spoilers, I will not say anything more about the plot except to say that it is creative and mostly entertaining (it occasionally drags a bit). The story was at its best when the author described life in the Atlantic Zone or what remained from life prior to the arrival of the tick. I loved when the characters encountered places from the old United States such as a Cracker Barrel or when school groups visited what was at one time D.C. Several small things baffled me a bit in the story. First, the area outside of the walled in Atlantic Zone is called the Salt Line. I never understood why \u2013 the area is a ring of chemically scorched earth treated to prevent ticks from crossing where the trash is slowly taking over the scorched earth. There was a reference to an old folktale about not treating the earth well, but I did not feel that the tale tied well to the whole Salt Line idea. Salt is also the name of an addictive drug used by some citizens in the Atlantic Zone and as the story unfolds Salt may potentially be ingested for other uses. It confused me that the word salt was used in these various items for no apparent reason and with no connection between them. I also would have liked the zone idea to have been fleshed out more. There is a lot of detail about the Atlantic Zone because a fair amount of the story took place there so I had a good feel for how it operated; I would love to have learned more about the other zones. I read this book as Hurricane Harvey was descending upon my city and in the storm\u2019s aftermath which I found to be appropriate timing. The people in The Salt Line live in a world where a potentially deadly tick has caused people to change the way they live. As climate change gets worse and these horrible storms keep occurring, we as a country are going to need to address ways that we can remain living in coastal cities without the fear of catastrophic and deadly floods. Hopefully we can find rational and less scary ways of doing so than the people did in The Salt Line.The Salt Line provides a lot to think about regarding today\u2019s world, and I know I will be contemplating these various issues for a long time to come.

This makes it a bit of a weird read.The writing itself is very good and certainly the story moves forward quickly enough to keep the attention of the reader. However, if you want a badass dystopian story this is not for you. If you want a bleak depressing story this is also not the right story. It's somewhere between a bit of horror (ticks that have wiped out huge portions of the populations), thriller (rebels) and humanism (reproduction concerns and overall quality of life questions). I felt confused at many points about what Holly Goddard Jones was trying to say. By the end I felt like I mostly understood the point, but didn't feel all that satisfied; hence my three star rating. Stereotype ShatteredI thought at one point that the author had to be a male given the lack of chemistry every couple had. Much to my shock I found out that our author, Jones, is a woman. While the stereotype shatters in my mind (lol); let me tell you a bit more about the pace of this book. There are three distinct portions to the book and if you feel like you liked what you read up to the end of one of the sections but are not intrigued by the latest \"twist\" in the story then I'd say you are probably safe to stop reading. I'm glad I read the whole book but could see people getting frustrated by the change of messaging in each section. In ConclusionOverall it's like Jones tried to put too much into her dystopian novel and missed a lot of key factors. I wanted more chemistry between characters, less back stories about irrelevant people, and more focus on one or two characters (the voice is constantly changing). Maybe that's why the thrill is taken away at some times; I had heard about the situation from too many voices at some points and just wanted to move on or go back to a favourite character or two. The Salt Line is not a bad read, but it's not a good read. It sits right in that awkward three star zone.

Most of it is a good four-star read. A lot of focus is on regular human relationships and the larger developments like the drug that allows the bunkered enclaves of the \"safe\" humanity to live without fear of the ticks. The action often feels like a boardroom drama mixed with mafia dons against a dystopian survival novel, but it starts out first as a bunch of rich thrill seekers wrapping themselves in high-tech fibers to enjoy nature without worrying too much about the tick menace. For a great deal of the novel, I was just fine with this. It had a rather more epic feel with a lot of characters and situations and developments that tended to lean a lot more toward a lit-fic bent than a straight SF or Horror. In fact, most of the possible horror moments and SF elements took a long back seat to everyday folk.That wasn't actually a plus for me. In fact, I often didn't really care about the folks portrayed and maybe it says more about me that I just wanted to see some epic tick action taking out more people than the guns eventually did.And then, there was the veiled theme burrowing into the setting. If we read this a certain way, the novel is just a souped-up novel of the Mexican-American border, featuring fear of foreigners and a very, very heavy reliance on drug cartels and related issues. With a new skin, of course. And this isn't much of a problem in itself, but some of the directions it took left a weird taste in my mouth. And then there are the related associations. The deeper allusions. And while it never comes right out and makes any direct connections, I feel like there's something rather... well, I'll leave it up to other readers to come right out and say it. I'm definitely not sure that there's any kind of intent. It just feels... icky, in a way. Even the border town feels like Tijuana.So, my hackles rose. No real issues about the whole pregnancy business or the drugs even though the uses and abuses took up a huge portion of the novel. In general, I liked the novel pretty well, but I'm beginning to get tired of the trend to put LIT stuff in SF. It dilutes the really fantastic stuff SF is known for.

An infestation of disease-carrying ticks has disrupted the country.

A few people still live voluntarily on the wrong side of the line and a few thrill seekers take adventure trips beyond the Line. They will spend 3 weeks in boot camp, 3 beyond the Salt Line and 2 in quarantine. I won't describe the life cycle of the ticks or the ways in which they can cause damage to people, but it's scary. I'm freaked out by bugs so I was a little reluctant to even read this book due to the ticks but I needn't have been because the ticks are rarely described in all their creepy detail and there is only one really gross scene. In any event, the ticks turn out to be the least of the problems of a group of adventure tourists who have signed on for a tour to see the natural sights beyond the Line. What started out as a post apocalyptic wilderness adventure story turned into something else about a third of the way in. Some of the participants have secret motivations for taking the trip. There are a lot of characters in this book, unfortunately the author signals who the good guys are because they are the ones with back stories, the rest of the characters are just names who barely even have physical descriptions. For my taste, the motherhood theme was hammered a little too hard. Each of the main female characters was defined by her relationship with motherhood.

But while along their journey to see the great scenery of the natural world, they are kidnapped by the native people living outside of the line and one of their own is killed. I guess my expectations were too high. After reading the description, I thought this book could go so many different ways. But after the first 15% or so, I was convinced it was going to go more along the lines of....And there was a little bit of killer tics. And a little bit of \"crazy killer people in the middle of nowhere\" vibe, but for the most part, the plot was mostly about how all of the people were connected to the outside world. And how the government had gone crazy. And how it was almost worth trying to survive the crazy tics instead of having to live on the other side...And I just didn't buy it. There's crazy adrenaline junkies, and then there's these people. Paying $200,000 (currency rate, is going to the movie costs, $30 so basically the same), living in some kind of campground (which we never find out about), and having a threat of mutant tics that can kill you within days if you don't perform a procedure within a minute. I just don't buy that people would pay to put themselves in this much danger for scenery. In addition, the book got very political, and then just overall boring. Some people die, and it's just kind of mentioned offhandedly to the point where I had to go back and reread the scene after it was mentioned later. There were a few scenes that got pretty gruesome, but most took place at the beginning of the book, and it made the whole book feel like it was written by two different people.

This book was described as being in the spirit of station eleven but with ticks. Being as I love me some dystopian fiction I gave this one a shot.So in this version of Earth, ticks have become a menace that is so bad that most humans live in zones beyond controlled wastelands (the salt line) and walls that keep them sequestered and safe from the natural world. The difference in this book is that a lot of the outside world is still beautiful. So there are very rich adventure seekers that pay vast sums of money to go on death-defying adventures to see fall foliage or the mountains etc. But beware if a tick bites, they only have a very limited time to burn them out of their skin or risk serving as an incubator for tick eggs - usually with fatal results.The strength of the novel lies in the characterizations and in the overlaying ideas of the adventure-seekers. Each member of the expedition has interesting reasons for venturing beyond the salt line. In particular the relationship between Marta and Wes was very much a favourite. Edie and Violet were two other beloved characters. I also thought the ticks and their impact on society were well through out and portrayed.The main problem I had with the book was with the politics of the outer-zone survivors who take the adventurers hostage. Once the hostages reach the village and are trapped, the books plot went downhill for me. The outcomes were a little predicable and the politics were rather simplistic. The pacing slowed down. I continued to read because of the characters but was overall unsatisfied with the ending. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed the read. I just didn't think it was amazing.

The entire concept of killer ticks sounds like it could be campy or over the top. That is not at all the case. The ticks are described in such a realistic and terrifying way that it truly becomes plausible. Or at least feels plausible. The author is able to use enough facts grounded in science to create this terrifying epidemic. This book did remind me a bit of Joe Hill\u2019s The Fireman in that way. It depicts a world that has been ravaged by some disease, where people\u2019s ways of life are altered because of them. I suppose there are a number of books that could fit this, but the over all tone and presentation and just the quality of writing put me in mind of Hill. That is a huge compliment from me as Hill is one of my favorite, must read authors.Honestly, there is not much that I did not love about this book. This is a book that you can read at surface value for the compelling story and intriguing characters, both of which are well developed. But you can also delve a bit deeper and see some scary parallels with our current world as well as our history.There are city or areas here that are protected by what they call the salt lines. They are contained communities where its residents are safe from the ticks. The walls and patrols that surround them keep them safe. But for those that are not fortunate enough to live in zone, those same protections for some, keep others out.But, you know there will always be some people that crave adventure, risk takers that are willing to chance leaving the protections that shelter them from the risk of ticks. A tour company caters to that and promises to provide that a breathtaking experience out of zone, where people can enjoy the nature they\u2019ve only seen in pictures, and bonus, they have the ability to do so and protect their tourists from the ticks. But this adventure comes with quite a hefty price tag, so its luxury for the rich.Edie is the one person on this trip that if not wealthy. She is the girlfriend of a mega pop-star. She is poor, and grieving, not a likely fit for this trip, but she is very relatable and her personality and and just goodness make her very likable. The range of other guests varies. There are scientists, a tech innovator, etc. We do get the POV of a few of these other guests, which I feel helped to flesh out the characters and also give them more background. I felt the characters were well done. Often in a book like this, multiple POVs can actually detract from the main story by not allowing the reader to focus in and \u201cget to know\u201d any of the characters well enough. But in this case, it worked well. Edie still felt like the star of the show for me, but I also came to really understand and enjoy a couple of the other characters as well, something that would not have happened if I had not had their perspectives.Once out past the walls, things do not go as planned, and the tourists get a more frightening experience of life outside of the walls than they anticipated. How they deal with this and try to survive, as well as what we learn in the process is as exciting as it is frightening.So, if you are craving a slightly disturbing view of future earth with life threatened by something as small and common place as a tick, with some adventure, thrills and terrors along the way, I highly recommend this one."}, {"userName": "Sonja Arlow", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6449756-sonja-arlow", "userReview": "3 \u00bd starsWell now this was a nice surprise. When you find a book that perfectly matches what you were in the mood for it feels like a lucky strike. The book description may make you think that there will be a lot of run-chase scenarios (as with most books in this genre) but there was very little scary tick action but rather the construction of characters with strong enough back stories to make them feel real. We have a waitress, a semi-famous popstar, a seemingly innocent housewife, a tech-savant only to mention a few.The story starts with the first briefing session of a group of adventure seekers who has paid through the nose for the \u201cprivilege\u201d to tour the out of zone area. Those areas are past the salt line where there is no control or protection against the ticks. But the appeal of these eco-adventures is to experience nature as it was supposed to and by default to also expose themselves to the ticks\u2026. But that\u2019s part of the thrill.The story focuses less on the obvious hook \u2013 the ticks \u2013 and more on the people dynamics when put under massive stress. I was toggling back and forth between 3 and 4 stars the whole time I was reading this. I love the premise, liked the characters and the unexpected twists in the story.

In the not too distant future, the world has been infested with ticks. The majority of these ticks cause Shreve's disease, which kills those it infects. In response, the entire world has been cordoned off into quarantined enclosed zones. Those quarantined, also known as \"Zoners,\" have been told that the exterior world was obliterated, destroyed via massive fires designed to burn landscapes clean of ticks.Despite the danger that the exterior world (out of zone) poses, it has become a tourist attraction full of abandoned towns and historical sites that capture how humanity once lived. Outer Limits Excursions (OLE) provides an outlet for this adventure or \"dark\" tourism, catering to the uber elite who have the pockets to bankroll such trips. The first portion of the book sketches out a group of characters who have decided to take such a trip. It explores the motivations leading these well-off tourists to take fate into their own hands and risk their lives for a glimpse into what once was.There's Edie, who is whisked away from her life as a poor waitress by Jesse, a mega pop star who charms her. There's Wes, one of the Zones' wealthiest men alive due to his tech savvy and entrepreneurial prowess despite his youth. There's Marta, who is the wife of a mob boss, and who cares more about her sons than anything else in her life. There's Andy, who leads the tour group for OLE despite his shady past.I often have a hard time following a book with so many characters, especially if the author neglects to flesh them out and make them seem human. This was definitely not the case with\u00a0The Salt Line. I was rooting for each character despite their flaws and sometimes nefarious intentions. The author makes you care about each character by telling their back stories\u00a0and how those shape their actions and beliefs. The author avoids stereotypes and generalizations; she really wants to you to empathize with each of the characters, to truly understand why and how they act the way they do.This was a fantastic read, one that I hope ends up on the big screen in the near future. It was brilliantly written and I could not put it down. I highly recommend this book for readers who enjoy dystopian thrillers and sci-fi.

I was expecting, and hoping for, more 'dystopian thriller' and less 'literature'. I wanted more burrowing tick terror, less commentary on political themes - David Perrone = Trump, both were celebrities of some importance in their own circles whose political aspirations came out of nowhere, both ran on a platform based around immigration and border security, and both have 'wall' dreams. The second half got more exciting, even though the ticks played a smaller part, as the community leader's real motives are revealed. I thought June's plan was a bit far-fetched and not that well thought-out, she should have done more research into the backgrounds of her targets' families. Things may have turned out differently if she hadn't made such a bold move - he wouldn't have known exactly where to target if the hostages hadn't been there.Overall, I wouldn't say no to reading more from Jones, but I wouldn't make an effort to find her books at the library."}, {"userName": "Juli", "userReviewDate": "Sep 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/38617426-juli", "userReview": "In this dystopian tale, residents of the United States live in regional zones protected by a wall that is surrounded by more than 4 miles of chemically burnt landscape, debris, and garbage. The wall is known as the Salt Line, referring to native folklore about punishment for disrespecting the land. The Salt Line protects those who live within the zones from miner ticks, ticks that can burrow inside people causing extreme pain, disease, and death. As with most death defying acts, there are adrenaline junkies willing to pay lots of money for the chance to risk their lives. An adventure company, Outer Limits Excursion, will take groups outside the Salt Line to see what's left of the old cities, forests and beauty beyond the wall. Of course, it costs an exorbitant amount of money for those weeks of training, three weeks beyond the safety wall and two weeks in quarantine. The latest trip has pulled together a strange mix of people -- a famous musician and his girlfriend, a rich financial tech wizard, bored businessmen, and even the wife of a gangster. Little do they know that this excursion is going to go wickedly wrong.....I enjoyed this book. It starts out a little bit slow because of character development, but that development time is vital to the story later. It sets the reasons why the characters react the way they do as the trip goes fundamentally wrong quickly. I'm not going to say much more about the plot, or why things go wrong because well....spoilers....readers will have to have their own Holy Crap moment just like I did. I said those two words multiple times while reading this book. I do think I was bashed in the head a bit too much with the respect nature/revenge of the planet theme. It wasn't turned up to 11-M.NightShamalan level, but got a bit tiresome. The suspense of wondering whether any of this group of rich, spoiled thrill seekers would survive saved the story for me...I was more interested in that than the constant angry-nature-in-your-face theme.All in all, a nice thrill.

I picked up this books based on this tag line: \u201cJones brings strong diverse female protagonists who dominate the plot line, controlling their own stories instead of furthering those of male leads.\u201d This is where a lot of my confusion and frustration is based.There is honestly NO good way to write this review without it being 100% spoiler free. You have been warned rage ahead..I will agree that some of the protagonists are female and possibly diverse, but that could easily be debated. There were certainly two fractions of humans in general and there were other nationalities, but I am not sure you really get a \u201cdiversity\u201d pass for that. Making all people (or two groups) the same without the cultural differences, is really just talking about diversity in class and nothing else. (Like..you know CULTURES). So, it was diverse in classes and not everyone was white. M\u2019kay, lets move on, \u201ccontrolling their own stories instead of furthering those of male leads.\u201d Yay! This happens so much in literature and I was excited to read a book that contained women controlling their fate and making shit happen, only it didn\u2019t. Every event or movement contained in this story was male related. A cure \u2013 a male. Safety \u2013 dude has it. A magical way out \u2013 A DUDES MONEY. I wanted to scream and parts of me died a little at some of the twists that literally revolved around a man and his money.Another thing that drew me to this title in the blurb is the fact that abortion is illegal. The Salt Line takes it a little further by glimpsing into our past and making it a whole \u201cred letter\u201d event with shaming for loose women. M\u2019kay, well lets see what shit the world goes to\u2026only it doesn\u2019t. It was like the author started to build a world where that mattered and then forgot about making a point. Maybe I could forget the issue, but she takes it a step further by explaining why women are changed on a DNA level when they are baking a baby in their womb and that is why secretly ALL women change when they have babies. It makes us into maternal machines of one-mindedness. So, I can\u2019t figure out what the author was trying to achieve here. My gut says that she, herself, is internally conflicted about this subject. Making the pieces of the story revolving around these issues uncomfortable to read.Holly Goddard Jones\u2019 writing was of median quality. Sometimes the story-line lagged and lacked finesse in filling in the character\u2019s motivation. I kind of broke my rule and peaked at some reviews. Many of them contained references to how the author nailed the Trump Wall issue, only I call BS. I know how publishing works. It takes time to write a book and time to release the book. I also read the authors bio. I can deduce that 2 years has went by since she started writing this book\u20262 years ago we had not even HEARD a whisper of a wall. So, I don\u2019t buy that the salt line and wall in this book is supposed to represent the theoretical Wall. I can do math.In all, The Salt Line was disappointing. The premise of mutant ticks and resulting isolation of society didn\u2019t manifest on the pages enough to crawl out of the shadow of the things I didn\u2019t like.

The blurb sealed the deal, despite the ick-factor of deadly ticks. They're nasty little creatures, and I'm thoroughly disgusted by them, but I couldn't let that stand in the way of what promised to be an interesting story with a unique take on how the world as we know came apart. I was willing to risk being grossed out (and I was, more than once) in order to dive into this story and see what happened.The story is told from many different perspectives, and while that may be off-putting to those who don't care for multiple POVs, it's my opinion that this particular story couldn't have been told any other way. The story would fall flat told from only one or two points of view, and the things that motivate both the hostages and the captors to do what they do is often vital to the overall story.Of the hostages, I think it's safe to say Marta had the most compelling story. I won't go into why, but she's the sort of character who thinks of herself as weak only to discover an inner strength she didn't realize she had. Of the captors, I was most interested in Violet. There was a great deal more to her than meets the eye, and her reasons for taking part in the kidnapping scheme (once revealed) made a lot of sense to me.I enjoyed reading the story, but there were quite a few things I (correctly) expected would happen, and it was a little disappointing to figure it out so easily. Redemption came with an unexpected twist that was so subtle, the implications of what I'd just read didn't register for a moment, and I had to read the sentence again in order to understand. Things took an intriguing turn from there!I can honestly say I've never read anything quite like this before. Jones' writing is imaginative and kept my attention solidly focused on the book as I was reading. The tick scenes creeped me out completely but I was horribly fascinated by them, as well.
