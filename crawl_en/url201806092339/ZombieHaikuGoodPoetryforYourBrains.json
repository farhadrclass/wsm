THANK YOU, RYAN.For the past five years or so, I have been fighting the zombie urge. Yes, I do love me a good zombie flick, but they started to appear everywhere: books and mash-ups and movies and music, heck I would not be surprised if McDonald\u2019s had a special Happy Meal that came with a blunt instrument for the little ones at home so they could begin practicing their defense skills. I read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE AND ZOMBIES and WORLD WAR Z and loved them both. I thought Z was a heck of a premise, and still go back every once in a while to read a few chapters. But unlike most of my friends, I was over the whole zombie domination thing. I went back to my life. Then, out of nowhere, I hear about ZOMBIE HAIKU. Be strong, I tell myself. Nothing good will come of this. And for two years, I hold out. I stay clean. No DTs; no depression; no relapses. Cold turkey, baby. Then I get to work today. And on my desk, my desk!, not anyone else\u2019s, I see a copy of ZOMBIE HAIKU looking at me with its rolled-back eyes and greasy flesh-eating mouth. I can resist, I tell myself as sweat beads bubble on my forehead. But then that little devil appeared on my shoulder (you know the one), and he encouraged me to go on, read it. I looked for support from my other shoulder, but I got nothing in return. Just one page. What\u2019s the harm of one little, teeny-weeny page? If anything, I'll prove to myself that I don\u2019t need zombies in my life. Okay, so page the first is fun. On the one hand, there is a lonely, unnamed narrator that wants to chronicle his thoughts in what he has called his poetry journal. The poems are to be haikus, with the familiar 5-7-5 syllable pattern. The other part of this page has another sort of writing: this one tells the story of Chris, who has recently been bitten and is hiding in the bathroom of an airport. Essentially, this collection of haikus becomes the written history of what is happening during this Zombie apocalypse. As neighborhoods become infected, and radio stations play only static, the narrator goes to his office to find some answers. Here, he is attacked by Beth, who was eating spaghetti until she smelled him. From this attack, the narrator flees to the top of a billboard where he thinks he can wait until the zombies leave. It is while waiting that the narrator understands: My town is broken.From this view, I see the end.Below, they gather.Sunburned and dehydrated, the narrator decides to flee by jumping down from the billboard. Not the smartest idea he\u2019s ever had. In the process of his escape, he is bitten--numerous times. This is where I think the genius of this collection of haikus comes in. Up to this point, I thought the haikus were filler, nothing worth noting. But as the narrator begins to turn from human to zombie, chronicling his thoughts, the haikus become clever (I'll let you experience these ones for yourself). At one point the narrator is so hungry that all he can write is:Brains, brains, brains, brains, brainsBrains, brains, brains, brains, brains, brains, brainsBrains, brains, brains, brains, brainsAnd as the transformation continues, the zombie part of the narrator tries to think like a human:As I start walking,I try to remember wherePeople like to hide.Then the narrator decides he wants to visit his mother, who is hiding in her house. When he gets to his mother\u2019s house, the narrator reflects upon what his father must be experiencing inside of a coffin and then proceeds to enter his mother\u2019s house to eat her:She\u2019s always with meEspecially if my gutCan\u2019t digest toenails.It seems that after having the narrator eat his own mother, the author, Ryan Mecum, a youth pastor from Cincinnati, Ohio, felt that the gloves were off, and the need for more gruesomeness was called for. This is provided when the narrator decides to visit a nursing home, or as the narrator sees it, a \u201cgourmet feast.\u201d At first I was kind of like WTF, he\u2019s going to have zombies kill poor, defenseless old people? But then I read:Little old ladiesSpeed away in their wheelchairs,Frightened meals on wheels.SNAP!, he went there, and I loved it. I was back. I was a full blown addict again after reading about the nursing home. From there, the zombies gathered in larger numbers and took on entire neighborhoods and farms and even a group of survivors in an airport.(I am going to intentionally skip over the part about the baby and the children playing hop-scotch. You want to know what happens, don\u2019t you? You have the fever, my friend.)If you like George Romero-type zombies, ZOMBIE HAIKU is for you. And even if you don\u2019t like Zombies, this book is for you. Why? Because Zombies are the bomb!!

If you want the full thing, along with some bonus material, head over here...The \"story\" unfolds via a man's poetry journal. Intending to document the glory of life, it ends up recording the downfall of civilization as he:runs from zombies,is bitten by zombies,becomes a zombie,bites and creates more zombies,and embarks on the never-ending quest for fresh flesh and the all important zombie food source, brains.Some of this anonymous man's poetry is only so-so (but what do you expect of a man who keeps a haiku poetry journal), and his pre-zombification haiku are as pretentious and pointless as you'd want them to be. But when said poet gets bitten, things take a turn for the worse -- while his haiku takes a visceral turn for the better, in my opinion. Dripping blood and pus and various other fluids onto the pages of his precious journal, he goes in search of the first of a slew of meals - -I mean, victims. (I'm not going to tell you who the first victim is, but ugh).I previewed a few of the disgustingickyawesome haiku on a previous teaser tuesday, but they were just the, *ahem* tip of the juicy cortex. Though there are throwaway bits, there are some moments of gross brilliance in here. Our mysterious zombie man retains his vocabulary pretty much intact (which somehow doesn't seem ridiculous), but everything becomes a little stilted and skewed, creating a nicely eerie, Other effect. And of course, some of his phrasing, reactions and desires are just hilarious."}, {"userName": "Brad", "userReviewDate": "Aug 14, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1022982-brad", "userReview": "Zombies do not writeThat is just idioticBut they think haikus.Haikus of big brainsOf squishy, squidgy entrailsThat little boys love.
