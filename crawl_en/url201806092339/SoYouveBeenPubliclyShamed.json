He shows us what a devastating and merciless process it can be, and how it is not done by them, but by us, and--worse--that it is often something that makes us feel virtuous when we do it. After all, haven't we merely exposed another racist, another snob, another homophobe, another chauvinist? Aren't we--virtually, effortlessly, anonymously--keeping up the good fight?In a score of revealing interviews and vignettes, Ronson gives us glimpses into the lives of people who have been subjected to various forms of public shaming, its immediate pain and long-term consequences. Among them are a woman who mocked an Arlington Cemetery \"Silence and Respect\" sign, the son of a prominent WW II British fascist who was filmed spouting German during an S&M scenario, a journalist who made up a Bob Dylan quote, and a young drunk-driver forced by a judge to wear an \"I am a Murderer\" sign. There are other interview subjects too, who provide context: the aforementioned judge, the college researcher involved in a simulated prison study, and the head of a firm who claims that through the use of innocuous tweets and bland blog posts he can move your shameful crimes so far down the Google results list that no one--except for the pathologically obsessed--will ever encounter them again.As usual, Ronson writes a sharp, humorous prose that is also touched with compassion. Like each of his books, it is that rare thing in journalism: an easy read, but a thoughtful read too."}, {"userName": "Paul Bryant", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/416390-paul-bryant", "userReview": "Update (I can't resist):Let shame follow this dentist even unto the last drilling and the last filling. & when he crosses the great divide, let all the animals he shot be waiting for him***THE REVIEW OF THE BOOKHere is a 100% fast fun astonishing intriguing hectic sprint through the strange subject of shame. Our tour guide, Jon Ronson, is an amiable journo who\u2019s cherry-picked a few recent spasms of shaming for our delectation and schadenfreude. Like a freak show, we can gawp and shudder in delicious horror.It felt like we were soldiers in a war on other people\u2019s flawsThe idea is this. In the olden days public shame was part of the judicial process:but that was abolished in 1839. And now\u2026 it\u2019s BACK. Public shaming has been revived and is in full swing on Twitter, Facebook and other social media. People are making mistakes and they are getting EXTRA-JUDICIAL PUNISHMENT doled out by ourselves, armed with only our keyboards and mices and tablets and iphones. We \u2013 us \u2013 are now the angry crowd of pitchfork peasants. We shove the miscreants in the stocks and pillories and pelt them with three month old cabbages and decaying turnips.ONE TWEET AND YOUR LIFE ENDS : JUSTINE SACCOHere is the example \u2013 the Awful Example \u2013 of Justine Sacco. Here is what public shame and utter humiliation does. She was a New York PR employee of some hot shit American conglomerate called IAC which I never heard of. On 20 December 2013 she was off on holiday to South Africa. She used Twitter and had around 30 followers. She was at Heathrow airport waiting for the plane to Cape Town and tweetedCucumber sandwiches \u2013 bad teeth. Back in London!That was the level \u2013 unfunny mild insults about British people. Hmph! But then :Going to Africa. Hope I don\u2019t get AIDS. Just kidding. I\u2019m white! Jon Ronson says \u201cshe chuckled to herself, pressed SEND and wandered around the airport for half an hour, sporadically checking Twitter. \u2018I got nothing,\u2019 she told me. \u2018No replies.\u2019\u201dThen she went off on her 11 hour flight and couldn\u2019t access Twitter. While she was in the plane her tweet exploded. Here\u2019s how much it exploded: in October 2013 she was googled 30 times. In November 2013 she was googled 30 times. Between 20 and 31 December 2013 she was googled 1,220,000 times.No words for that horribly disgusting, racist as fuck tweet from Justine Sacco. I am beyond horrified.Her level of racist ignorance belongs on Fox news. From IAC, her employers : This is an outrageous, offensive comment. Employee in question is currently unreachable. Fascinated by the Justine Sacco train wreck. It\u2019s global and apparently she\u2019s still on the plane. All I want for Christmas is to see Justine Sacco\u2019s face when her plane lands and she checks her inboxIn fact her deeply tasteless comment was an attempt to spoof white ignorance. \u201cLiving in America puts us in a bit of a bubble when it comes to what is going on in the Third World. I was making fun of that bubble.\u201dThe world did not get the joke. (\u201cI can\u2019t fully grasp the misconception that\u2019s happened round the world\u201d.) She had to cut short her holiday. \u201cPeople were threatening to go on strike at the hotels I was booked into if I showed up\u201d. IAC fired her. (In this book people are getting fired for perceived-to-be offensive tweets right and left.) Jon Ronson puts his finger on the reason for the vast avalanche of insult which poured down on Justine Sacco in the last weeks of December 2013:Dragging down Justine Sacco felt like dragging down every rich white person who\u2019s ever gotten away with making a racist joke because they could. SILENCE AND RESPECTSo JR looks at various horror stories of this type, of lives destroyed by thoughtlessness. Here\u2019s another example. Two women were guiding a party of disabled adults around Washington for the charity they worked at. They liked to make spoof photos, like smoking in front of No Smoking signs, juvenile stuff like that. They went to Arlington Cemetery and just took leave of their senses. One posed in front of the sign which says \u201cSilence and Respect\u201d \u2013 she pretended she was yelling and was giving the finger as well. What humour \u2013 it\u2019s the opposite of silence and respect, see? I get it! So did all of Facebook when they insanely put the photo up, and the woman in the photo was fired and spent a year afraid to leave the house. SHAMELESS: THE SICK NAZI ORGYJR examines examples of people who have been horribly shamed but were NOT destroyed. A good example in Britain is Max Mosley. He has had a fair amount of shame to bear in his life \u2013 son of Oswald Mosley, who was head of the British Union of Fascists and a supporter of Hitler. Max became head of Formula One racing and he liked to attend S&M parties. One of which was filmed and splattered over a tabloid newspaper here in the UK. There he was whipping girls and being whipped by girls:F1 BOSS HAS SICK NAZI ORGY WITH 5 HOOKERS\u2026 At one point the wrinkled 67-year-old yells \u201cshe needs more of ze punishment!\u201d while brandishing a LEATHER STRAP over a brunette\u2019s naked bottom. Then the lashes rain down as Mosley counts them out in German. Within a year Max had successfully sued the paper for breach of privacy and appeared on a few general political discussion shows in the UK. It turned out that the public couldn\u2019t care less about S&M orgies. He was unshamed. This inspires Jon to visit Kink Studios to see if he can answer the question : is the porn industry populated by people immune to shame? Unfortunately he gets frankly rubbishy answers and does not pursue this line. But it does make me wonder \u2013 what do the models in even the anodyne disrobings on the most vanilla of porn sites think about their intimate parts captured forever by the internet\u2019s powers of recall? Assuming they don\u2019t stay in the porn biz for life, does this ever have any repercussions in the private or public sphere? WE ARE THE NEW CROWD OF PEASANTS WITH PITCHFORKSThis book is nothing more than lightweight journalism but JR has a knack \u2013 just when you wonder what this or that person in the story had to say, what was their angle, what happened to her afterwards \u2013 he\u2019s anticipated you and he\u2019s emailed or skyped or twittered the person and he\u2019s got the reply. Jon interviews James Gilligan (author of Violence: A National Epidemic \u2013 read and reviewed!) who says that if shaming people worked prison would work and no one would reoffend, but it doesn\u2019t work. In the end, says Jon, this has been a book about people who didn\u2019t do very much wrong and got vengeance and anger rained down on them. Vengeance and anger and shaming appears to be our default position, here on the internet. I would have liked JR to discuss more why men get shamed in a forensic manner, such as for plagiarism, and women get shamed in a personal manner which very rapidly descends into misogynistic rape & death threats (always the ol\u2019 rape \u2018n\u2019 death threats) \u2013 he mentions this in a couple of lines then veers off.But that\u2019s what this book is \u2013 filled with interesting ideas and questions, and leaping from one internet zone to another with the alacrity of an Olympic gold medallist gibbon \u2013 from Twitter to 4chan to instagram and back again. He didn\u2019t ask us on Goodreads if we had any good stories, though.

I very much think of the internet as a wild west. It's so new, it's constantly evolving, and there aren't any real agreed upon rules and regulations.

Thank God for pharmaceuticals\"Then, at Heathrow:\"Chili- cucumber sandwiches- bad teeth. Back in London\" Then before boarding the final leg:\"Going to Afria. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding, I'm white\"A few hours later, her life imploded. And it probably might remain that way. Because the public never forgets, there are no second chances given in the court of public opinion. Life, as she knew it, was over. Possibly forever. Admittedly her jokes were in poor taste-reprehensible even- but in the court of public opinion via FB and Twitter, her penance, as far I could surmise from the book, is that she live with the shame. Forever.  A life destroyedThis woman's story- in addition to a multitude of other cases- forms the premise of So You've Been Publicly ShamedPoliticians, authors, porn stars, ordinary folks. Whether caught in a lie or a senseless act of their own making. Consequently, Jon Ronson set out to chronicle their lives, a post-mortem of sorts. Did they ever recover?

I don't like it. It's boring. Where's the story? Is someone going to get punched? Anyone? Where is the writing style that doesn't make me want to shove a fork through my eye? I mean, these are all things I need..However. Everyyyyyy once in a while, an exception comes along.SAY HELLOOOOO TO THAT EXCEPTION.This book is so fun!!!!!It is not only fun; it is interesting. It is not only interesting; it is funny. It is not only funny; it is smart. In short, it is everything I need to have a good time while also feeling very pretentious and smart and patting myself on the back for eight consecutive weeks for reading anything with more literary merit than a young adult contemporary romance.THE STANDARDS ARE LOW AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY I LIKE THEM.So this book is about the recent (? semi-recent) trend of publicly shaming people on the Internet. Which is my favorite thing. Watching racists get sucker punched by the entirety of Twitter is my, like, religion. I pray at the altar of screenshots, you know? #JustMillennialThings.So I was very curious to see if this book could convince me that this ultimate form of technological vigilante justice in any way a bad thing.And it, um, kinda didn\u2019t? And not for lack of trying. It definitely got me convinced that, like, hey, maybe we don\u2019t need to ruin some of these people\u2019s entire lives. And there was exactly one person in this book who I thought was totally undeserving of the shit storm she formally received, out of maybe 8 examples. But I read this book shortly before Charlottesville, and it\u2019s hard to look at the hardworking people of Twitter outing literal Nazis and be like, Hey. Bad. Because it isn\u2019t. Vigilante justice can be sh*tty, but I\u2019m not opposed to any anti-Nazi action. Any. Try me.ANY.I didn\u2019t feel shamed by Ronson (buh dum ch), though, or anything. So it didn\u2019t really detract from my enjoyment of the book.What diiiiiiid detract from my enjoyment was Ronson casually, easily, you know, just...totally shattering his authorial credibility to me as a reader. Fun stuff! But seriously, this whole book is about delving into people\u2019s pasts to find out the things they\u2019re most opposed to people finding out. Which is already thin ice. But there\u2019s a moment when Ronson makes really clear that the only privacy he gives a sh*t about is his own. (BOOOOOO, shouts the audience.)My guy Ronson (and I seriously did love his voice throughout this So Much, which makes this heartbreaking moment even more tragic) attends a class on how not to feel shame. This class begins with every person in it going around and stating something about themselves that they don\u2019t want the other students to know. Ronson includes every person\u2019s answer, which is...maybe not necessary. EXCEPT GUESS WHOSE ANSWER IS NOT INCLUDED. YEAH. YOU GUESSED IT. IT\u2019S RONSON\u2019S.What kind of lack of integrity\u2026So I don\u2019t know, man. I initially rated this five stars, because I read it in a day and had so much fun with it and also my brain felt all big afterward and it made me so pretentious that I wore a monocle for the next 8 consecutive business days, but there\u2019s no way I can give that type of action five stars. That sh*t is NOT COOL JON.But will I be reading other Ronson sh*t? Hell yeah I will.Bottom line: A crazy good book with One Annoying Thing.IS NOTHING EASY---------------pre-reviewI LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS BOOK.i seriously couldn't put it down, and there exists a very limited number of nonfiction books i find un-put-down-able.i am certain not a single one of you cares about my feelings on this book, and yet i will share them.review to comeee"}, {"userName": "Kelly (and the Book Boar)", "userReviewDate": "Sep 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11183856-kelly-and-the-book-boar", "userReview": "Find all of my reviews at: http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/\nMost of you are probably already familiar with the concept of public shaming. Heck, we see it on Goodreads all the time. The author who chooses to get spammy or games the ratings system with sockpuppets or trolls reviews when someone dares to bash their \u201cspecial snowflake\u201d is quickly drawn and quartered by users. If you\u2019re an American you were probably even forced to read about public shamings back in high school . . . \n(^^^^This version was sooooo much better than the original)What you may not know is how prevalent public shaming was as a form of punishment back in the olden days. While the practice of slapping a Scarlet A on someone\u2019s clothing went by the wayside hundreds of years ago and public airing of grievances became a practice reserved strictly for Festivus, Al Gore\u2019s invention of the interwebs brought back public shaming in a B.I.G. way. With today\u2019s handy-dandy technology and the anonymity that the internet provides, the world has become full of Keyboard Commandos . . . \n\u201cWith social media, we\u2019ve created a stage for constant artificial high drama. Every day a new person emerges as a magnificent hero or a sickening villain. It\u2019s all very sweeping, and not the way we actually are as people. What rush was overpowering us at times like this? What were we getting out of it?\u201d\nSo You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed is a book that covers a handful of \u201cshamings\u201d and the aftershocks the publicly shamed experienced while trying to get their lives back together. It covers everything from plagiarists to stories of those with good intentions gone wrong due to made up facts and studies, but the sections I found most intriguing were those of jokes gone bad. If you have been on the internet more than a nanosecond, you\u2019ve probably seen someone get butthurt. It\u2019s easy to read something the wrong way when tone is absent. Thus was the case with \u201cThe Tweet Heard \u2018Round the World\u201d . . . \nand Lindsay Stone . . . \nWhile it\u2019s obvious that both of the above were cases of using poor taste, both of these women\u2019s lives were ruined leaving the author to note:\n\u201cThere must have been among [their] public shamers a lot of people who chose to willfully misunderstand it for some reason.\u201d\nI agree. I mean, as distasteful as they may have been I think most people \u201cgot\u201d both of the jokes, and while I agree it\u2019s up to these individual\u2019s employers to determine whether or not they want to keep these women on their payroll, I have to ask why it\u2019s not okay for someone with less than 200 social media contacts to post something insensitive without getting flamed by millions, while Trey Parker and Matt Stone have made millions doing the same????\n(FYI: In case you are Anne live in a cave and are unfamiliar with the program, the correct answer was \u201cNAGGERS.\u201d)We then flip the script in order to tackle the issue of a shaming which backfired . . . \nWhile Justine Sacco and Lindsay Stone clearly put themselves out on display for judgment, the two gentlemen in the previous photo did not. Not only did Adria Richards take it upon herself to publicly shame the two tech convention attendees when she happened to overhear them making a private \u201cdongle\u201d joke which resulted in them losing their jobs, she also ended up losing hers when she unintentionally publicly shamed herself whenever she opened her mouth . . . .\n\u201cHave you ever heard that thing, \u2018men are afraid that women will laugh at them and women are afraid that men will kill them\u2019?\u201d she asked.I told Adria that people might consider that an overblown thing to say. She had, after all, been in the middle of a tech conference with EIGHT HUNDRED bystanders.\u201cSure,\u201d Adria responded. \u201cAnd those people would probably be white and they would probably be male.\u201d\n\nRichards went out of her way time and time again to prove that ALL things male were most definitely not A-Okay with her, which led to something Richards should have really been afraid of \u2013 actual threats on her person and a DDoS attack on her company\u2019s servers which resulted in her termination. And that is where So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed got terrifying. While I believe Richards seriously made a mountain out of a molehill and deserved to be fired for being a public asshat, the nearly immediate response of the internet shamer to threaten a woman shaming victim with some sort of physical harm, up to and including rape, as a form of public degradation while never mentioning the same with respect to a man was nauseating. The same can be said for the reaction to various sexcapades. A woman who makes a stupid joke (or has a differing opinion on a book) causing her shaming can expect to be called fat or a c*^t or a bad parent or told they should be genitally mutilated, but a public figure who admits to having an affair will most likely be lauded a hero once he buys his wife a fancy vacation to \u201crebuild their marriage\u201d or helps her get elected as President . . . \nIf you\u2019re looking for a \u201csmart\u201d book that is easy to read, I highly recommend this one. Many thanks to Sam for bringing it to my attention \u2013 and for picking something we can FINALLY agree on.

I felt like every chapter brought on a major revelation or had a great nugget of wisdom to mull over. If anything it made me realize how incredibly powerful shame can be, as if we aren't all aware of that fact already. I doubt you could find a single person who hadn't been, at one time or another, shamed in some way in front of many people. But imagining how that must feel and then actually hearing from people who had that happen to them on a massive scale--like Justine Sacco, Jonah Lehrer, Lindsey Stone, and more--was fascinating. I definitely have more empathy for people who suffer the consequences of the internet's ruthlessness. Everyone from 16 to 60 years old should read this.One big takeaway for me from this book was the idea that apologies aren't a one-way street, even if that's how the public wants to treat them. Apologies are accepted or rejected for a reason. When someone apologizes, you have a choice to forgive them and accept their apology. And if the public is calling for someone to own up to something and apologize, they should be willing to accept it and move on. But today, especially on the internet, everyone wants the apology without the reciprocative acts of forgiveness. Just something to think about while you wait for this book to come in the mail, because you all should definitely read it. 4 stars"}, {"userName": "Diane", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/279256-diane", "userReview": "This was a fascinating read about shame in the modern world. The Internet has made it easier to make a mistake and then be publicly humiliated for it, and Jon Ronson researched and wrote about a few famous cases.One incident highlighted in the book is Justine Sacco. In December 2013, Sacco made a bad joke on Twitter, was hounded on the Internet, fired from her PR job, and has not fully recovered from the public shaming. This was the joke she wrote: \"Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!\"Ronson shows sympathy toward Sacco, pointing out that posting a bad joke about white privilege probably didn't warrant the incredible amount of worldwide shaming she received.Another case in the book is Jonah Lehrer, who was caught fabricating Bob Dylan quotes. Lehrer's book Imagine: How Creativity Works was pulled by the publisher when the scandal broke, and some of his other works were also called into question. In addition to losing his writing jobs, he was also scorned. When Lehrer decided to make a public apology, Twitter users were especially critical, saying he couldn't redeem himself.Ronson talks to Sacco and Lehrer, and several other people who experienced a very severe and public shaming on the Internet. Ronson also looks up the history of shaming, and researches different theories of crowd behavior. The result is an engrossing pop-psych book, one that I kept pausing to share interesting stories and quotes to anyone who was near me at the time. I highly recommend it to those interested in social media, psychology, sociology and any fans of Jon Ronson.Favorite Quotes:\"Something of real consequence was happening. We were at the start of a great renaissance of public shaming. After a lull of almost 180 years (public punishments were phased out in 1837 in the United Kingdom and in 1839 in the United States), it was back in a big way. When we deployed shame, we were utilizing an immensely powerful tool. It was coercive, borderless, and increasing in speed and influence. Hierarchies were being leveled out. The silenced were getting a voice. It was like the democratization of justice.\"[Ronson interviews a 4chan user, asking her what sorts of people gathered on the site] \"A lot of them are bored, understimulated, overpersecuted, powerless kids,\" she replied. \"They know they can't be anything they want. So they went to the Internet. On the Internet we have power in situations where we would otherwise be powerless.\"[Psychiatrist James Gilligan studied shame among prison inmates] \"Universal among the violent criminals was the fact that they were keeping a secret,\" Gilligan wrote. \"A central secret. And that secret was that they felt ashamed \u2014 deeply ashamed, chronically ashamed, acutely ashamed ... I have yet to see a serious act of violence that was not provoked by the experience of feeling shamed or humiliated, disrespected and ridiculed.\""}, {"userName": "Carina", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27131708-carina", "userReview": "Okay my book club people, close your screen here and read no further. Walk away now, before you tar and feather me, and super glue the latest Franzen to my nose...Started well, and as the back cover promised, had \"funny and thoughtful\" moments. But - there were parts that made me angry at the constructed and biased outcomes, there were holes so wide a road train could have done a 3 point turn, and anytime Ronson got close to touching on something important but complex, Jon Ronson ran away fast if the journey wasn't where he wanted his book go.There were whole chapters that did nothing (the shame workshop ran by an unqualified looney was worthless - gee, who saw that coming?). Scientific studies were used sparingly and selectively. People were consulted as \"experts\" when they clearly were not, but Ronson obviously needed someone else to take ownership of his unsubstantiated conclusion (yes Mercedes, I'm thinking of you)(can't imagine an underground hacker is easy to track down and verify either). Ironically there was even a section that served purely to shame a person Ronson clearly didn't like, and a Teflon coated implication that the lack of women in IT was their own fault, for overreacting to \"jokes\".The biggest, most glaring issue Ronson uncovered was an important one - *why* are women \"shamed\" (although abused/attacked/bullied/trolled would be more apt descriptions) so horrendously for minor misdemeanors? And yet this discovery was simply acknowledged and barely addressed, let alone explored. Obviously a book that ventures into \"feminist land\" isn't good for sales, and Ronson ran away fast.It's clear Ronson wants to present a lightweight, humorous, and yet, somehow, still important read.

I hate online trolling and people who are unnecessarily rude to people (so, you know I am LOVING this election year #sarcasm). The description sounded like it would be an interesting look into how the public busts out its torches and pitchforks when easy prey presents itself.I got exactly what I expected. I only gave it three stars because the writing was a little dry and at times repetitive (and I am not trying to shame the author! :)) But, the stories he told and the investigation he did really revealed how we are sick as a society and how it seems to be the tendency of the majority to use our current social landscape to attack those who do unfortunate (but often not completely terrible) things until they are completely destroyed. The examples he gives in the book of minor plagiarism, tasteless joking, etc. I see an article about almost every day online. It is quite scary and sad - a simple joke can bring the world crashing down on you.

I know that not everyone will agree or disagree, but there is a chance I might stir up a troll or two and I accept that - I just try not to feed the trolls and remain positive! Luckily, Goodreads seems to have fewer trolls than Facebook or Twitter.If trolls and unreasonably handled social media situations intrigue you, give this book a shot!One thing that I wanted to point out that is an irony (and maybe makes me a bit trollish), is that the first story in the book is about plagiarism. The author talks about researching sources and making sure that what you are saying is quoted exactly or it may destroy your credibility. When discussing some of the last social media activity of the person in question he attributes a tweet DIRECTLY to the person discussing a Fiona Apple album. I went to the twitter feed for this person, and it is actually a RETWEET . . . so, he basically printed something incorrectly in a chapter about making sure you check your sources so you don't print things incorrectly . . . I was amused."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Feb 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1033805-mark", "userReview": "Jon Ronson meanders around topics tangentially related to social media shaming. Like his other books, it is not so much a book about public shaming as it is the story of how he became aware of the topic, and what the expert he interviewed was wearing, and how the victim he interviewed moved her food with her fork at the restaurant, and how many times he checked his phone while observing a group therapy session. He offers no conclusions, just narcissistic vignettes.I was moderately disappointed in this book, since this is a topic I'm intensely interested in, but once I realized that this was also the author of The Psychopath Test I was able to lower my expectations.Full disclosure: I received a free uncorrected proof of this book to review through Goodreads First Reads giveaways.

Seriously. What's happening? Why are people rushing to Facebook and Twitter to post pictures and comments that are so clearly in very bad taste? Who thinks of these things in the first place? Do these people have no filter? Is decorum a thing of the past? This, I think, of those who received the shaming. Regarding those shamers responding to them with an endless stream of vitriol and threats...I'm speechless. I don't understand the behavior. Though the subject matter is engaging and the author puts his personality into this, I felt the book was all over the place. I don't want to spoil anything by detailing the cases discussed, but it did not feel cohesive as it jumped from plagiarism to several cases of internet shaming to history of shaming to vigilante hacker groups to questionable support groups to judges using shame as punishment to pornography...you get the idea. I often failed to see a clear connection from one chapter to the next, and the book felt like it meandered without a firm purpose until it just rolled to a stop. I was also challenged at times to understand why the author viewed some scenarios as acceptable...but I suppose that is the crux of all of this in a way: one person's deplorable is another person's hysterical. I've thought about the topic daily for weeks. It's more than a little disturbing to learn just how much destruction can result from a single online post. Cyber bullying and trolling have serious consequences of course, but public shaming (according to Ronson's research) comes from a different place. Why are people so reactive? I am admittedly shocked at the examples posted by adults but I acknowledge that people make mistakes, everyone makes mistakes, and putting stuff out there online doesn't give others the right to judge/verbally assault/destroy lives.Because I have young children I am terrified for their future. Everywhere I look at all hours of the day people are staring at their phones. If this is the future then behaviors have to change. As parents, educators, and members of society, we need to find a way to shape/teach/model better behavior online or perhaps just better behavior in real life. Kindness and empathy. But above all else, if people would spend their time and energy focusing on themselves, rather than analyzing, criticizing, and reacting to others, life would improve for everyone. Too bad that feels like the opposite of what social media is promoting. I suspect someday soon there will be companies offering to review people's posts before they go live to minimize the chances of catastrophes such as those outlined in this book.My review is as disjointed as the book! This would be a good book club selection but otherwise I'm not sure I'd recommend it. 2.5 stars"}, {"userName": "Imane ", "userReviewDate": "Jan 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62761616-imane", "userReview": "\u201cWe\u2019re creating a culture where people feel constantly surveilled, where people are afraid to be themselves.\u201d \u2015 Jon Ronson, So You've Been Publicly ShamedJon Ronson is an amazing writer.

Highly recommend."}, {"userName": "Mark", "userReviewDate": "Oct 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52374080-mark", "userReview": "This book is a real eye opener to what is going on today and in a way we can bring it back to what happens on this site, Goodreads. Jon Ronson starts out being just like the majority of us, he has the righteous view that if you have done wrong then you need to be slammed for it, humiliated, publicly shamed. However if we remember before the days of the internet, what did we do? Call each other names, cut a person from our social circles or at worst, write to the local paper and 'out' someone. This last method usually being quite useless as due to legal reasons the person's name would never be published.Enter the internet. Now we can take public shaming to another degree. We can sit at keyboards in our private homes and shame whoever we like, legal only comes into it if our targets decide that they will take the matter further. BUT DOES ANYONE SEE AN ISSUE??? We can shame based on fact, shame based on fiction or just shame because we are insecure low level trolls who have nothing better to do with our lives. Yes I am aiming this at those trolls who 'hate' online because their target is too fat, too ugly, too rich or too talented. Take it further, she is dating the guy I want to, he got the promotion I wanted, we used to be friend, she is stunningly beautiful, he has the perfect body, they drive an awesome car etc etc. Perhaps it is you trolls her deserve the shaming but that will never happen because you sit gutlessly anonymous at your computer. Here I would like to mention an Australian woman by the name of Charlotte Dawson. She was a victim of your abuse and it was unwarranted. Please google Charlotte to find the story.Anyway Ronson's views change when he himself becomes an unwitting target of negative publicity online. From this point he decides to track down so very public figures who have been shamed online. Yes, they did actually 'commit' an act, some worse than others but none deserving of the online shaming they received. So You've Been Publicly Shamed follows the stories and the devastating effects it has on people.We all have that righteous streak - I do and I am unforgiving when it comes to 'real' crime but this book really opens your eyes to lesser evils. We are so quick to tweet or join online forums to shame but who amongst us is pure. We hear a lie and think the perpetrator should \"burn in hell\". We see a motorist throw rubbish from a car window and our anger levels peak, surely this guy should be imprisoned for 20 years. But take a step back, should a fine be issued and the matter is resolved or should we get online, posting photos of his car complete with licence plate and tell the world what low level scum he is?At what point does our anger tip over to jealousy and we move from righteous to envious. We move from 'concerned citizen' to troll. The leap is not a big one.I implore you to read Ronson's book if any of this has you thinking. in the very least it will make you think twice before sending that spiteful tweet or online message. Think about the fact that the majority of the time you don't even know the person you are commenting on. Sure they may be famous but what you know OF them does not mean you KNOW THEM. And I can guarantee that you don't know the whole story to the situation - please don't tell me you do because you read it in a magazine or online.At the start of this review I mentioned that in ways this can be linked to what happens on Goodreads. I would just ask all of those who respond to peoples reviews to be objective. Though in a slightly different realm those of you who post ugly, abusive and hurtful comments in response to reviews you don't agree with have just become trolls. Books, movies and music are all forms of entertainment and as such attract a widespread cross section of opinion. Never will we all share the same opinions so lets just read and respect the views of others. If you disagree by all means say that you disagree for this reason or that but voice it objectively. Don't become an online hater for the ridiculous reason of liking a book more than someone else did.I would just like to end this by saying that Charlotte Dawson was a New Zealand born, Australian television presenter. I have never met her, I have never spoken to her, I do not know her at all. Jon's book just brought her sad story back to mind. R.I.P Charlotte 1966- 2014."}, {"userName": "Jan Rice", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5864678-jan-rice", "userReview": "The motif of So You've Been Publicly Shamed, the way I see it. I used to have this cup. Looks like this particular pic came from Etsy.Jon Ronson's focus is on individuals who've been shamed on social media, especially Twitter. Jon isn't an intellectual or scholar--and so it is that I feel comfortable calling him by his first name--but he is doing us all a great service by thinking out loud about the phenomenon. It's not that he doesn't want to offer conclusions; he does, but his ideas remain in flux. The conclusions, such as they are, strike me as less important that shining the spotlight on public shaming. Talking--publicly--can be a boon. Early on, I realized the book was having a positive therapeutic effect on me. I think that's when it became clear the key issue is the shaming, i.e., the shamer(s), and not the target; not the victim. Now the author, Jon, wavers around that point. He starts out thinking of shaming as virtual punishment for, say, an exhibition of white privilege. He thinks that's justice and is happy for the power to participate in the shaming. Then he realizes what's happening is akin to the stocks, pillory, and whipping post: a revival of punishment via public humiliation. He sees how an individual's whole life can be reduced to some careless and inane utterance that took ten seconds, and even that utterance can be willfully misunderstood, the better to make it go viral. But he persists in trying to distinguish somebody who should get off light from someone who truly deserves what they get. He's awfully drawn to believing in the virtual community's potential to do good by speaking out and remedying the imperfections of the justice system. However, he may be dealing with an oxymoron here: a good lynch mob.I think I remember that prior reviews I read of this book also tended to be drawn to blame. It's easy to think whoever wrote the viral tweet du jour deserves what they get and hard not to think that way. How could a person be so stupid and blind as to tweet she won't get AIDS because she's white? How could somebody be so nutty as to post photos of herself hollering and shooting a bird next to a sign calling for silence and respect in a veterans' cemetery? Those are two of the basically good guys who got reduced to their worst moments and publicized around the world. And if those are the good ones whose worldwide humiliation, job loss, and general shunning is regrettable, according to the case made by Jon Ronson, what about those who did something even worse? Columnist Bill Torpy sums it up in my local newspaper, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. His focus is definitely on the one who makes the misstep:There\u2019s a formula to this skit: Someone cluelessly posts a comment, photo, joke, nasty slur or diatribe on what they think is a closed network among friends, or like-minded others. Why they do it \u2014 having seen the wreckage of others \u2014 is a head-scratcher. Perhaps it\u2019s social media\u2019s thrill of immediate interaction and reaction that feeds the dopamine in the brain. And stupidity.Then someone redistributes the post, often with their own scolding analysis. And then it\u2019s on. The evil-doer is roundly and repeatedly excoriated as more and more people jump in to add their wisdom, calling for the person to be fired, kicked out of school or run out of society.Such internet pile-ons allow us to proudly \u2014 and very publicly \u2014 wave our banner of personal virtue. In doing so, the offender is taught a lesson, as are possible future offenders. It\u2019s a harsh world with this self-policing. ...Ari Cohn, who works for FIRE (the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education) said common sense concerning the offending person\u2019s language matters not. Activism for social justice takes no prisoners.\u201cStudents now have the ability to make their voices heard \u2014 for better or for worse,\u201d said Cohn. \u201cA mob will very quickly achieve results. Schools and businesses don\u2019t want PR disasters. They capitulate.\u201dSo there we have it. A misstep = evil-doing. Beware the mob.Be forewarned, by all means. We believe rape is wrong and the victim never deserves it, but that doesn't deter us, I trust, from advising our daughters against getting drunk while alone and skimpily dressed in lowlife bars.Online shaming has a random quality; not everyone who unwisely opens his or her mouth may be noticed and outed. Online shaming can target the wrong person, for example, someone with the same or similar name as that of the hapless perpetrator, or someone whose picture shows up in the wrong place at the wrong time, as in the case of the man mistakenly thought to have sent out the false Hawaiian missile alert. Online shaming is fast, not slow and cautious. It is typically accompanied by schadenfreude. It's vindictive, not merciful. It's an excuse to really let go, to go all-out. It's disproportionate: one person standing for some despised form of wrongdoing is made to suffer for all. It's like the climate on campuses where students are reportedly concerned about triggering and trauma yet don't hesitate to come down hard on others.One targeted man thought that believing the public wants an apology is off-target; they wanted him gone, destroyed, and never heard from again.Being targeted makes the victim toxic. Anyone who's too close will be targeted too, especially anyone who stands up for him or her. The would-be defender can also become fair game. That's why employers and associates so often turn tail and run.Jon struggles with the fact that some people are less targetable than others. Where do they get their Teflon? Are we talking about some aspect of character, or is it a behavioral formula? And if your Teflon is inadequate and you get hit, your reputation can be cleansed, although only by an online talent who understands how to handle Google's algorithms. Nor is it cheap, so hopefully you have very deep pockets.Women when targeted are frequently treated more harshly than men and are called out in the most misogynistic language. So much for online vengeance as being a tool of social justice. In a recent New Yorker article on current theories of violence, Paul Bloom recounts the hypothesis that women are punished for not living up to men's social expectations, and although his article is on physical violence, that same hypothesis fits the virtual violence of online shaming.In the same article, Paul Bloom also describes theories that violenceis neither a cold-blooded solution to a problem nor a failure of inhibition; most of all, it doesn't entail a blindness to moral considerations. On the contrary, morality is often a motivating force: \"People are impelled to violence when they feel that to regulate certain social relationships, imposing suffering or death is necessary, natural, legitimate, desirable, condoned, admired, and ethically gratifying.\"Hmm, Jon? Apparently, feeling just doesn't guarantee one is being just. The assumption that one's target \"deserves it\" is one too easily made. Human beings all too automatically rationalize the deservingness of those toward whom we direct violence.But as I said early on, Jon Ronson is not sure; his conclusions waver. That's a good thing.Paul Bloom wrote that it's the doubt and ambivalence that sometimes accompany violence that may eventually point the way toward moral progress. I'm applying those words about physical violence to the online phenomenon of shaming.When I was 21 I was working on the psychiatric ward of a big-city hospital in a family-like team of other assistants and nurses. Into this comfortable mix came a reminder from the past whom I didn't much want to see there, a young lady who'd attended my high school. Let's just say I found the work environment to be a better fit than high school. So maybe I was giving her the eye; I really don't remember. But next thing you know, she'd reported me to our supervisor, and I got my wrist slapped. Oh, I thought; power! So this is how it works! So next thing you know, there was this other guy who didn't quite fit in in some way or other. I'll write him up and report him, I thought. And I did. But then I saw it was about me and not about him and felt bad about it. And I learned. Never have I done that again. Glad there was no social media to exacerbate the situation.But I'm still learning to deal with what comes my way.Addendum: I forgot to mention the parallel between outing and shaming in today's social media and the reporting that we understand to have gone on under totalitarian or fear-based regimes. In 1984 for example, some children report their parents, if I remember right. We've been given to understand that in such cases the reporters feel good about it; proud. Jon Ronson does mention the phenomenon of people working as informants to the East German secret police, the Stasi. People would sign up despite low pay and mushrooming workload. One theory was that reporting made them feel special and important. They were willing collaborators. A Stasi psychologist, though, concluded that people wanted to make sure the neighbor was toeing the line -- behaving properly. Yet at that point Jon remains enamored of how in his view social media--Twitter in particular--gives a voice to the voiceless. Voice to the voiceless? If everyone is hollering at high level and some wield such disproportionate power? I'm not so sure about that, especially considering the efficacy of a common target in uniting a posse. Little voices uniting as one powerful voice through a common target, in other words. He's also concerned with people's new need to be careful and tiptoe online. He thinks that's the loss of freedom. It could be, though, the emergence of conscience.Anyway, he's reflected on \"what level of mercilessness\" he feels comfortable with. He no longer jumps into the fray unless the target has \"committed a transgression that has an actual victim, and even then not as much as I probably should,\" even though he \"miss(es) the fun a little.\" But who has judged that guilty-appearing individual, and who appointed this particular cluster of social-media users as judge and jury? Jon's discomfort could reflect his doubt, and, paradoxically, the emergence of conscience.If community is the conduit from which conscience emerges, then what kind of community is it that is giving birth to the evolving conscience?"}, {"userName": "Julio Genao", "userReviewDate": "Aug 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3977017-julio-genao", "userReview": "want to read this because this author gave an amazing TED talk about how the internet allows us the dark satisfaction of shaming another person without consequence to us.in effect, destroying the lives of other people to feed the ragey beasts living in the darkness of our collective id.all day long.it's a fascinating talk:http://www.ted.com/talks/jon_ronson_w..."}, {"userName": "Hannah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788446-hannah", "userReview": "While I am writing this, a case of public shaming is going on in Germany - it is not in any way as vitriolic as the ones Jon Ronson talks about but is proof that his book is timely and important. Public shaming is interesting and horrifying - Ronson talks about cases where a single tweet unleashed an outpouring of hate that stand in no relation to the offense. And I agree with him in his conclusion that this is disturbing trend. He made me think about these cases where the victim of shaming really had done something offensive and in the first instance it might seem right to call them out on and where this calling out spiraled and become very ugly, very fast. While I do not agree with his assessment of the victims being completely not to blame (because wow, some things really were horribly offensive and they decided to share them anyway), hearing him read out all the inhuman threats made for an uncomfortable experience. I cannot even begin to understand how debilitating it must be to experience this outpouring of hate. But while I thought parts of the book were really interesting, it was to shallow for me to really appreciate it. I would have liked more insights into the influence misogyny and racism have and why it is that men come out of these shamings a lot less harmed than women. He sometimes started to talk about it but then backed out again. The reason might be that his approach is a more personal one and that he cannot really get out of his own skin for long enough to broaden his approach. By the end of the audiobook is got really frustrated with the lack of depth and the way he just kept repeating his points over and over and over again to the point of sounding condescending to anybody disagreeing with him. So overall, this was an important book that could have been handled a lot better.

That shame is all just a \"wee bit tricky.\" . . A former flame asked, \"much like his wicky?\"Which was not at all what he sought with his fame._________________________________ So You've Been Publicly Shamed in some ways resembles an informal sociological study of situations in which the Mob Rules and the speech police patrol the Net for the next villainous offender of sensibilities, real or imagined. As a few examples, Ronson reviewed the case of Justine Sacco who made a stupid joke before the final leg of her trip to South Africa that she hoped she didn't get AIDS but \"I'm white!\" she tweeted, 11 hours after which she landed to find out twitter had exploded into making her the momentary \"#1 worldwide trend.\" She lost her job and pretty much everything else.There's also the case of Lindsey Stone who posted a pic of herself in front of a veteran's monument flipping the bird and making a face; she also lost her job. The most interesting story was that of the overly sensitive Adria Richards who took an iphone pic of two geeks at a computer conference who were acting like the imbecilic Beavis and Butthead joking about the computer terms \"dongles\" and \"forking.\" She took the pic and immediately ran to the net to call these guys out in hopes they'd get fired. What happened next was unbelievable and eerie. The net and its collective darklords unleashed wave after wave of scorn upon her. The two guys were fired, but ended up with better jobs as a result. Richards, on the other hand, lost her job and, as of the time JR interviewed her, hadn't been able to land fully back on her feet. \"...with social media, we've created a stage for constant artificial high drama. Every day a new person emerges as a magnificent hero or a sickening villain. It's all very sweeping, and not the way we actually are as people.\" J. Ronson, Shamed. He set off the siren for me on the dangerous path we're going in the U.S., a country that was founded, in part, on the principle that freedom of speech is invaluable and the right thereto inviolable: \"We're creating a culture where people feel constantly surveilled, where people are afraid to be themselves.\" J.

He gives them a voice, humanizes them and shows the ways in which lives can be torn apart (and in some cases, put back together) by public shaming; either via a court sentence, or even Twitter.

I was glad that he let his personality seep into the story instead of just blankly delivering facts and impartial commentary. I thoroughly enjoyed this!"}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28602001-emma", "userReview": "Jon Ronson has put together an interesting, if somewhat disjointed, selection of case studies illuminating the role of public shaming in modern society. He asks some timely questions but I'm not sure I agree with some of his conclusions. The subject of shame was treated in a rather haphazard fashion in the book, bouncing from one case study to the next. We find out that men are less likely to get hounded by the community for sexual scandals than women or receive no backlash at all, that women and men women from ethnic minorities are more likely to be subjected to intense shaming, that some people who are attacked by online mobs commit suicide... but little more depth or breadth is added. All of the above points seem common knowledge to me, i'd have liked more acknowledgement of the why and the how. Being destroyed by Twitter mobs must be absolutely horrendous for those singled out, but his sympathy for women like Justine Sacco seems to be going too far. She posted the following on a public forum, one in which anyone can share or comment on what they see. First:Chili-cucumber sandwiches-bad teeth. Back in London Then: Going to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding, i'm white!Like much of the written word in these formats, there is no context, so misunderstandings (if that's what they are) are frequent and likely. Even in text messages with friends and family, I would argue that all of us have had experiences where we're unsure of the true meaning of the message because we have no idea of the tone of its author. Perhaps that was meant to be sarcastic, we think. Or are they joking? Were they having a go? Am I being too sensitive? This writ large is Twitter. Well, once you've added the anger and hate. How are we to know what's a joke anyway? And are some things really appropriate to joke about when your subject matter can read it and be offended or hurt? Should we say anything at all when it can end in such horrendous abuse? Ronson argues that her Tweet was meant as a 'comment of white privilege-on our tendency to imagine ourselves immune to life's horrors' [p.68], but even with that explained to me, i'm not sure it comes across that way. Would I have written it? No way. Even if I wanted to make that point, it wasn't the way to phrase or or the appropriate place to post it, as a jaunty aside right after jokingly maligning the English about trivial things.Likewise, Lindsey Stone who posted a silly picture of herself giving two fingers to a military memorial. I get the idea behind doing things in front of signs telling you not to do something (we've all seen them: pictures of people walking on grass next to DON'T WALK ON THE GRASS signs etc), but perhaps the choice of just what to mock should be considered more fully. I really appreciated the recent campaign by an artist attempting to shame people taking thoughtless selfies at a Holocaust memorial (https://petapixel.com/2017/01/21/arti...) Is is wrong to shame these people? Not in my eyes. I'm not advocating the darker aspects of the mob: death threats, rape threats, posting of personal details such as addresses all go way beyond too far. But these altered images and some of the moderate tweeters who responded to the above examples forced people to really think about what they were doing or saying. Perhaps they even prevented others from doing something so stupid, insensitive, and harmful. As Judge Ted Poe was quoted as saying 'sometimes people should feel bad' [p.79].In the end, Ronson seemed to be emphasising that people do not always deserve the vitriol they get online, that maybe we are the ones getting it wrong. He suggests that we need to look at ourselves, the way we respond to these issues/events, and whether we are part of the problem, our knee jerk reactions putting us in the role of pitchfork holder. Perhaps that's true, but there needs to be some acknowledgement between the different types of shaming and whether it may even be our responsibility to do it. The dentist who killed Cecil the lion? http://news.nationalgeographic.com/20... Caroline Cried-Perez who suggested Jane Austen be on a bank note http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology... ? Both of these people where hounded online, but these nature of their apparent transgressions are entirely different. If we are to think abut our role as the arbiters of shame, then we also need to think about how we decide who deserves it. I'm not talking about the tolls, who want to call you a c*** if you say the sky is blue, I mean the larger community working to highlight illegal or immoral or inappropriate behaviour. Increasingly, we have taken on that role as the world is brought to our screens and we have the means of making our opinions heard. I think Ronson has it right in asking about the shamers as much as the shamees, the greater being how we as individuals and then as communities are policing the world and if or when we are abusing that power. It's honestly fascinating and this book is certainly a good way into the discussion. Another is just to put the book down and get on Twitter to see it for yourself....if you dare."}, {"userName": "Sam Quixote", "userReviewDate": "Sep 17, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5759543-sam-quixote", "userReview": "\"YOU'RE AN ARROGANT CONDESCENDING BASTARD!\"\"I RESENT YOU FOR HOLDING THE PHONE!\"Jon Ronson is in a Shame Eradication Workshop in Chicago being screamed at by people who are letting out their inner monologues, uncensored. A couple of them have just admitted they enjoy having sex with their cats. It\u2019s part of Ronson\u2019s exploration of modern public shaming, a lot of which focuses on social media sites like Twitter. A PR Exec called Justine Sacco tweeted \u201cGoing to Africa. Hope I don't get AIDS. Just kidding. I'm white!\" \u2013 a bad joke but obviously intended satirically \u2013 that blew up, caught the attention of millions, and got her fired. Lindsey Stone, a care worker, took a photo of her flipping off a \u201cSilence and Respect\u201d sign in a veterans\u2019 graveyard in Washington DC (the setup is part of an in-joke with her friends), and consequently became a hate figure online, as well as losing her job. Bestselling author and New Yorker columnist, Jonah Lehrer, lost his job, his book contract, his agent, a number of speaking gigs and his credibility when it turned out he\u2019d fabricated Bob Dylan quotes used in his last book, Imagine: How Creativity Works. Dylan actually said: \"God, I'm glad I'm not me,\" but Lehrer changed it to: \"God, I'm glad I'm not me. I'm glad I'm not that\". He created some other lies (one of them, \u201cStop asking me to explain\u201d, was pretty ironic) and tried to pass them off as truth before being discredited by journalist Michael Moynihan.The various stories recounted here are fascinating. Besides the ones already mentioned there\u2019s Texas Judge Ted Poe who incorporates public shaming in his punishments and claims it lowers re-offending; Max Mosley, the Formula One honcho and son of Oswald Mosley, the famed WW2 British Nazi, who got caught in an S&M orgy; and two American software developers who made a couple of dumb Beavis and Butthead-type jokes during a tech expo and got fired when a woman sat in front of them retweeted what they were saying. There\u2019s no real thesis here though. Ronson is being entertaining collecting these various stories with a running theme, but there\u2019s not much behind them besides the shock of how these people paid an enormous price for \u2013 let\u2019s face it \u2013 damn small things. But because of the ubiquity of social media sites, self-righteous hysteria can be whipped up instantaneously and people\u2019s lives dramatically changed by enough outraged strangers. The blurb says that ordinary people are using shame as a force of social control, that people on social media are tearing apart people who exist outside the boundaries of what we perceive as \u201cnormal\u201d, but it\u2019s not a convincing argument. Plenty of people say tasteless things online and never have their lives trashed like the ones in this book and they\u2019re never ashamed of their behaviour. Ronson does make the interesting observation though that men who\u2019ve digressed in some way are often threatened with sackings while women, in a similar situation, receive rape and death threats instead. But, like a lot in this book, it\u2019s touched upon and then just as quickly discarded. Clearly a lot of work\u2019s gone into this book but it doesn\u2019t feel very substantial. Social media can be scary and shame can destroy some people\u2019s lives while completely bypass others isn\u2019t a powerful conclusion. That\u2019s alright though because I read Ronson for laughs and gossip and there\u2019s plenty of that here. The opening chapter about a Jon Ronson spambot on Twitter who loves food was hilarious and I had no idea that Jonah Lehrer publicly apologised while having a live Twitter feed behind him that was instantly destroying his speech. And I just like the full title and author name: So You\u2019ve Been Publicly Shamed by Jon Ronson - really, what\u2019d that jerk do to you!? (You gotta make yourself laugh, y\u2019know?)There are plenty more great bits in this book that are good fun to read and very well written. If you enjoy Louis Theroux\u2019s docs, you\u2019ll like Jon Ronson\u2019s books which are essentially the literary equivalent. They reveal fascinating stories but are basically playing off of humans\u2019 trashy natures at the same time - and that\u2019s a fine trade-off I\u2019m happy with!"}, {"userName": "Lotte", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25309949-lotte", "userReview": "Such a quick, informative and interesting read about the immense power of public shaming in the Internet age. Ronson includes case studies of people who have been publicly shamed on the Internet (e.g. for tweeting a badly worded, vaguely racist tweet, etc.) and have faced severe consequences for that in their real lives (e.g. getting fired from their job). He also explores the role of shame in a broader historical context, with shame being the motivation and catalyst for more aspects in our daily lives than I had realized before.I think I would've given this five stars if the author had gone into a bit more detail about how public shaming is vastly different for men and women (he does mention it briefly in the afterword). Nowadays, while men mostly fear getting fired after tweeting/posting something that meets backlash, women not only often get fired, they also receive countless death and rape threats for a long time after the incident. I think the question of how shame is often utilized in a very gender-specific way could've been a a great addition to this book!Aside from that, it was a truly well-balanced and interesting read that proofed once again that I should pick up non-fiction more often."}, {"userName": "Matthew Quann", "userReviewDate": "Jan 24, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22699228-matthew-quann", "userReview": "You know, sometimes the internet is a miserable collective consciousness that seems to bring out the worst in humanity. For me, I think of the Facebook comments section and what little I know of Twitter--I'm still a dinosaur who doesn't tweet--as some sort of digital hellscape where everyone closes off their inhibitions and lets loose the worst vitriol imaginable. What's more, the way social media has gradually become a kind of news platform has made me feel dejected when scrolling through my feed. I suppose it is all a bit difficult for one to wrap one's head around, but luckily Jon Ronson has written a very good book about the angry people of the internet and their victims. In So You've Been Publicly Shamed, Ronson introduces a slew of individuals who have suffered some form of public shaming via the internet. Ronson then breaks down their perceived affront to the web, their shaming, and subsequent life. It is these portraits that offer the most humanistic vision of this disturbing behaviour in which we all participate to some degree. In seeing the ways in which these people often suffer in the aftermath of seemingly innocuous pranks, I came away with the feeling that the punishment does not always fit the crime. Ronson is a capable narrator who manages to inject a lot of humour in his investigation of public shaming. Though I did miss out on all of the photos included in the print collection, this is the type of book which I relish most in audio format. I'd previously enjoyed the audiobook of The Psychopath Test by Ronson some number of years ago and was happy to return to him here.I enjoyed So You've Been Publicly Shamed because it helped to illuminate a part of the internet with which I've always been bothered. It provides the temporal distance necessary to examine how perceived activism and snap judgements have real human consequences. Ronson also delves into the trend of the internet assuming moral superiority on any given issue and denouncing those who speak up against what is held to be the internet truth. I've always believed that multiple perspectives are needed in order to come to a viewpoint on any matter. By restricting the stories we allow ourselves to hear, read, or listen to we narrow our vision. I'm glad to have read this book and I'll be suggesting it to friends and family for its important examination of a topic on which I've had many discussions. Ronson, I believe, is ultimately advocating for kindness and understanding in the place of rage and viciousness. It's a stance that I can get behind and a future for which I hope. [Review of Audiobook]ADDENDUMWith all the shade I cast at social media in this review, I'd just like to say that Goodreads is my favourite form of social media. Though I am biased, I think that through reading we develop greater empathy, are more open to differing opinions, and are much kinder to one another."}, {"userName": "Paul", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11951948-paul", "userReview": "Is social media; good or bad? Facebook is one of the original ones, but it has since been joined by Twitter and many others. Most of the time these can be a good thing, are fairly harmless, and keep people in touch with each other, but there are times when it isn\u2019t. In this book Ronson meets and talks with those that have suffered from the overwhelming and brutal response from twitter, as well as other forms of public humiliation.He starts with himself though. He is a bit of a twitter addict and on finding out that there was another @jonronson account, with a fondness for baking amongst other things, he started to do some digging. Turns out it was being run by a couple of guys as an experiment. He manages to meet them, mainly to see what was driving them, but also to persuade them to cease. This shocked him somewhat and into finding out what others had experienced. He starts with the \u2018pop\u2019 science writer Jonah Lehrer. It is an author that I have read before, and liked, but in one of his books a journalist noticed that some quotes didn\u2019t ring true. After some correspondence with Lehrer, bordering on harassment at times, he publishes. Cue Lehrer\u2019s career going down the pan, even more so when he makes a public apology on twitter.There are other case studies in the book too; a PR executive, who just before getting on a plane to Africa made a tasteless joke about AIDS and Africa, a lady whose private photograph of her mucking around in a cemetery went viral, a software engineer whose innuendo laden joke about dongles in a private conversation at a tech developer conference offended a lady sitting in front of him. She posted a photo on twitter, and it went viral. All were sacked from their jobs. In a horrible reprisal the lady who posted it then suffered at the hands of the twitter mob, and lost her job too.He interviews Max Mosley, better known as the ex boss of the FIA. The News of the World tried to shame him by releasing a film being \u2018entertained\u2019 by a number of dressed in military garb. He sued them and won, he has never felt any shame, but more importantly he hasn\u2019t suffered from online humiliation unlike others. Ronson concludes that this is because for certain things a lot of people really don\u2019t care. He starts to explore the darker side of this, and comes across a site called 4chan, where people\u2019s desire for finding subjects to be offended by and extracting online revenge is rife. Very worrying stuff. He also talks to an American politician who has used shame as part of a punishment, he says this is limited to that individual and takes place in the local community affected by the crime, then it can have some effect in reducing re offending rates. But even this humiliation that now takes place now was considered excessive when you go back a couple of hundred years.This public shaming of people, for what most sane people would consider just ill thought out comments or stupid lapses, is getting out of hand. The irony of it is that those doing the shaming are sometime equally guilty of crass, insensitive and downright horrid remarks; this once useful social tool is now a heavy blunt instrument. Ronson is a good journalist, and in this book he has had a long hard look at the way we use social media, the potential pitfalls and the potential jeopardy that we face in what we think are private offhand comments. This should be the start of the debate as to what is considered acceptable with regards to shaming of people, and also what steps well over the line when the online mob get started."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11513064-amanda", "userReview": "I'm giving this book five stars not because it is a perfect book, nor because I agree with everything in it. Rather, I think it is a very important book because delves into a conversation that everyone who uses the internet should be having with one another and themselves. This book made me thing deeply about my own use of social media while being extremely fascinating. Ronson goes in depth into many of the \"flash in the pan\" scandals that we all remember from the ast few years and which weren't so \"flash in the pan\" to the people involved. He does an exceptional job giving voice to each person and side involved in each instance and in analyzing his own thoughts and opinions in what seems to be a real attempt to put aside his own bias. That said, I still feel like social structure and privilege and how they play into who should and should not be shamed could have been explored more deeply, but it was touched upon. This book is fascinating, engaging, funny, sad and will make you think.
