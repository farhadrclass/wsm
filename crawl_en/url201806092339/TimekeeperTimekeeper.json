Everything that had gone into the making of the world.\n3.5 stars. Timekeeper is a mysterious tale of magical clocks controlling time in a Victorian London where mechanics are revered\u2026And a forbidden love story involving a clock spirit and his keeper. Danny & Colton won Lola's award of the cutest young adult gay couple of 2016. Their love is so pure and sweet\u2026 maybe a little too much. We get half of a page of sexish content between them, but otherwise, they stick to gentle but brief kissing and that\u2019s it, that\u2019s all.It\u2019s true that I wanted more passion between them, but that can come in time (after all, this is a trilogy) and it didn\u2019t bother me as much I may make it sound right now, because I was focused on many other things.\n \u2018\u2018You\u2019re chaos and order and everything in between. Like sunshine kept back by clouds. Like the entire world\u2019s imploded inside you, but all I see are the stars are sewn into your skin. You\u2019re filled with soft, dark music.\u201d His smile was gentle. \u201cI hear it all the time. Your music.\u201d\nSuch as the mystery. What\u2019s great about Timekeeper is that it doesn\u2019t let the romance overshadow the fantasy elements. In fact, the mystery surrounding the clocks is relatively more important. Which is rare with gay romance\u2026 Normally, it\u2019s the main focus of a story. But not in this case.I truly, truly adored the world-building Miss Sim introduced us to. It\u2019s really, really interesting. Steampunk is not a very popular theme in literature, but it should be. There is so much that can be done with it and this author developed it in an interesting way. I especially found the idea of linking mythology to this Victorian world clever. \u201cHave you ever kissed anyone before?\u201d Colton thought, then shook his head. \u201cI don\u2019t think so. I\u2019ve thought about it, though. There used to be a girl down the street who was very pretty. But that was a long time ago.\u201dDanny, who hadn\u2019t anticipated this answer, took a moment to reorganize his thoughts. \u201cSo you would have kissed me if I was a girl?\u201d\u201cI would have kissed you if you were a girl. I would have kissed you if you were purple.\u201dThere is so much potential in this series. I can see the world-building expanding and revealing many new secrets and characters and danger and hope and love and mystery.I will have to say, however, that I was not impressed with the characters themselves, which gave the impression that this was written for a young audience\u2014twelve, thirteen-year-olds.The world-building is great, the story is good, the writing fine\u2026 but the characters? Just okay. With the exception of Colton who is nothing short of an angel (and I cannot resist them), they are all rather common\u2026 banal\u2026 unsurprising. At one point I could guess what each one of them would say next, which made the dialogs a tiny bit dull\u2026 and tame.\n He touched his chest, then touched Danny\u2019s. When he felt Danny\u2019s heartbeat, he pressed his palm against it, mesmerized. \u201cYou\u2019re a marvel.\u201d\nBut, overall, I am happy with this book. I was extremely excited to get my hands on it\u2014so, so excited\u2014and when I was finally able to read it, I immediately jumped on it. I\u2019m looking darn forward to some more action, mystery, romance (sexy scenes, please!) and steampunkness.Blog | Youtube | Twitter | Instagram | Google+ | Bloglovin\u2019"}, {"userName": "Emily May", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4622890-emily-may", "userReview": "Meh. I am obviously just not that interested in clocks and mechanics.Timekeeper has an ambitious premise. It's a Victorian steampunk universe where the ties between physical clock towers and actual time are inextricable - when two o'clock goes missing from Colton Tower, time itself is disrupted. Danny Hart is a clock mechanic, a timekeeper, someone with the ability to feel and manipulate time. Suffering from anxiety and haunted by the memory of his father who was trapped in a time-Stopped city, Danny tries to fulfill his job at Colton Tower. Of course, it's not going to be simple. Danny soon finds himself falling for the spirit of the tower in a whirlwind LGBT romance.The world is creative, for sure, but I just couldn't find interest in it. The prose is forgettable and the plot wanders aimlessly for a lot of the book, making it really hard to keep turning pages. As I said, mechanics are not really my thing. Cogs and gears do not float my boat. The manipulation and fracturing of time is interesting, and yet the book actually spent very little time on that.What the book does focus on is a lot of protests from the general public against clock towers and clock mechanics. But the whole thing seemed like an ill-conceived plot point used to throw some drama into the mix. The protesters regularly cause trouble throughout the novel, but their reasons for protesting are... what? The \"monopolization of time\"? As Danny points out, the towers and mechanics are crucial to keep the world functioning. The citizens seem to be unaware of this, but the \"they wouldn't understand\" excuse seems like a shitty reason to keep them in the dark.There's also very little atmosphere. This is a steampunk Victorian London FFS, how is there no atmosphere? I think perhaps its because the author opts for a generic portrait of Victorian London with the addition of clock mechanics, instead of developing details to make this world one which is truly unique and memorable. Mechanics/machines themselves are a key feature of the steampunk genre, so this in itself is not interesting and/or different enough.Worst of all, the romance was so disappointing. LGBT steampunk romance makes for a shiny selling point, but it is marred by instalove and lack of development. There's no slow flirtation and chemistry, just instant sparks flying. Danny meets the spirit and literally five pages later they kiss. I did not have time to care about their relationship. So boring.Also: The DEUS EX MACHINA is strong with this one.

Which I'm really really happy about because it's my first steampunk experience that I can flail over! Usually, someone says \"steampunk!\" and I say \"eh\" like the eloquent turtle fish I am. But this?! It kicked me in the feels AND it had fantastic characters and THINGS EXPLODED.I'm so loving this. #ExplosionsFTWIt's set in an alternate reality England, so there is tea and scones. Nice. I cautiously admit I could tell the author wasn't British, but at the same time it wasn't GLARINGLY obviously (like in other books *cough*Lock & Mori*cough*) so I still got the old Victorian vibe quite nicely. Plus tea.Also CLOCKS?! I LOVE CLOCKS. I'm actually kind of obsessed with time so (yes I'm the person who knows when it's 2:32 because that is a huge difference to 2:30, of course, you mulberry) and the fact that there were clock spirits, so basically TIME PERSONIFIED INTO ADORABLE CINNAMON TRAGIC ROLLS just so won me over. Tragic ghosts/spirit characters are my thing. Darlings that need protection.And the characters were AMAZING. Can we talk about Danny?! First off: he's adorable. Second off: he has anxiety and PTSD and so much baggage and nightmares and he saved the world once but also lost a bit of himself in the process and he's hURTING. And just: precious child. He's a clock mechanic. Which means, he can...fix clocks? IDEK. There's magic involved, okay. He senses time and can fix it and etc. (Code for: I actually am not sure. But whatever. I am the mulberry.) He also has a horrible piece of junk car that he loves but also hates and I like this relationship.Plus he has an epic best friend, named Cassie, who is a mechanic, and supports Danny no matter what and PRECIOUS FRIENDSHIP GOALS.And can we talk about the clock now? Dear dear Colton. I LOVED COLTON. He had a bit of a \"childlike\" thing going on, despite being, well, A CLOCK. Because he didn't know much about the world. But he's just so adorable and I loved his and Danny's relationship. No instalove! And they were both so tragic so that ajfkdlasd I just shipped it very very much. I also love these kind of doomed/forbidden romances...aka it's forbidden because mechanics + clock spirits = illegal to where Danny works. And it's doomed because WELL COLTON IS A CLOCK AND CAN'T LEAVE HIS TOWER AND ALSO CAN'T EAT CAKE SO YOU SEE THE RELATIONSHIP IS HEADED FOR THE ROCKS EVENTUALLY. But #shipping. It was such a well written romance. Also the romance WASN'T the sole point of the book! We have a mystery about bombs and we have towns that have Stopped with people trapped inside without time! There's Greek mythology stuff going down. Danny deals (or doesn't deal, as the case may be) with severe mental illness.OMG A GOOD PLOT. A GOOD ROMANCE. GOOD CHARACTERS. AND CUTE CLOCKS. What more can one want?Okay okay I do have a few vague negatives. Just to be Debby Downer:\u2022 It was like 90% via Danny's POV but then it'd switch over to a secondary character. This ALWAYS jolted me and I didn't like it. I prefer when books have consistently one POV or consistently multiple.\u2022 It also like had this Greek mythology snippets going on???? About Aetas who started the whole magical clock thing. So OKAY. JUST DON'T CARE IS ALL. I just wanted Danny and Colon. #mybad\u2022 I also did think it dragged in a few places. Particularly in the middle.Also this would make a GREAT movie. Like the Hugo Cabret movie?!? (Or the The Invention of Hugo Cabret book I suppose.) SO MUCH CLOCKWORKS AND COGS AND EPIC DAPPER SUITS AND JUST YAAAAAS. MOVIE.ALL IN ALL: I really enjoyed this one! It was different from what I usually read. But it just combined sooo many things I love (aka explosions + tragic ghosts) and I loved the accurate anxiety representation. Plus an engaging plot with mystery and high stakes = VERY PLEASED. Who doesn't like it when clocks have opinons and like to kiss people and read fairy tales? I like. And just Danny/Colton were PRECIOUS. Bless this book.This wasn't a simple matter of a clock falling to bits; otherwise, the numeral would have been found by now. No, this was far more complicated. This was an act of burglary or vandalism.Stolen. An entire hour taken like it was the last piece of cake on a neglected platter.There comes a moment when time seems to slip faster, running long then short, shadows shrinking as the sun climbs. It's the moment, he decided, when you're no longer a child. When the concept of time and the need for more of it come together and make you powerless. Make you yearn for the longer days, the lazy days, before you knew what time passing actually meant.#relatable"}, {"userName": "Cait \u2022 A Page with a View", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47412532-cait-a-page-with-a-view", "userReview": "This was such an original and charming story!! It's set in a version of Victorian England that has cars, telephones, and is more socially advanced (so they're cool with gay couples and women as mechanics). There's some retold mythology about Chronos at the base of their society and it's told throughout the book between chapters. The basic idea is that people needed to step in to control time, so they rely on the clock towers in each city. If anything were to happen to one of those clocks, time in that city would Stop and the inhabitants would be trapped in a time loop. Danny is a young clock mechanic whose father is trapped in a town that was Stopped, so he's dealing with a lot of guilt, anxiety, and general fear of clocks. At the start of the story he meets an apprentice in the clocktower and is attracted to him. The apprentice has never read any fairy tales, so Danny tells him stories while he works. Every time they meet the apprentice will have whatever injury the clock tower has (like a mangled hand), but then will be whole by the time Danny's done working. Another character tells Danny how he fell in love with the spirit of a clock tower and how it only leads to doom... and then Danny discovers that the \"apprentice\" is actually the spirit of the Colton clock tower. There are a lot of people protesting the clock towers and trying to blow them up and a whole bunch of other obstacles to their romance. Danny & Colton were adorable, though. This was a really sweet story in a creative world and I'm glad I read it! I was never super pulled into it, but it was generally fun the whole way through. I know the description says that it's a series, but this book wraps up the plot enough that it could pass as a standalone. So don't worry about cliffhangers or anything.Thank you to the publisher for sending me an ARC!"}, {"userName": "Nina \u273f Looseleaf Reviews \u273f", "userReviewDate": "Sep 29, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3456885-nina-looseleaf-reviews", "userReview": "This book came out of nowhere and hit me over the head with its awesome!Danny is the youngest clock mechanic in a alternative-world Victorian England where clock towers like Big Ben literally control time. Each city has its clock tower that safeguards its \"time zone.\" If the clock tower stops working, so does time in the town, and the people in it become frozen and unable to escape - which is exactly what happened to Danny's father three years ago. He has worked so hard to become a good enough mechanic to save the city of Malden. The last thing he ever expected was to meet a spirit that controls time itself - or to fall in love with him.I'm absolutely loving this new trend in YA fiction to make a world so detailed that the plot doesn't feel recycled. Clock towers that control time, backed by an entire detailed mythos of deities? Count me in! From first picking up this book, I hoped and hoped that such an amazing premise would not disappoint, and trust me, Ms. Sim did not let us down!The best part of the world building was that the characters themselves didn't know everything about the physics of their world. Danny knows how clocks work, but he only believes the gods and clock spirits to be legends until he meets them. Even the clock spirits themselves don't have all the answers to how they operate or how they came to be. As a reader who was piecing it all together, it was perfectly paced that we were learning the world alongside Danny himself.Speaking of whom, I loved him as a protagonist! He is just plain grumpy, but given his difficult life, why wouldn't he be? Since losing his father, he has entirely dedicated himself to work, at the cost of most friendships and his relationship with his mother. When he meets a boy who begins to crack his shell of self-loathing, it really means something.And Colton? P r e c i o u s. He was simultaneously ancient and wise while having a complete naivety about humans and their emotions. I won't go into too much detail with the rest of the characters, but generally speaking, there was a lot of delicious moral ambiguity that I love. The \"good guys\" had their own motivations and the \"bad guy\" had an understandable motivation behind his actions.In terms of Danny's sexuality: I almost wouldn't count this as a queer book. It's one of those few LGBTQ romances that is not defined by the protagonist's sexuality. There are so many times that characters have conversations with Danny along the lines of, \"Do you not want to introduce me to him because he's a guy? Because it's okay,\" and Danny just simmers and thinks, \"I don't care that I'm gay. I care that he's not a human dammit!\" So if what you're looking for is a gung-ho queerpositive love story, this may not be entirely it, but if you're looking for an awesome story with a queer character, look no farther!As I'm sure you guessed from the four-stars, there was one major irk that kept this down a star: the setting. Ms. Sim is insistent that this takes place in 1875, but one that is so technologically progressive (cars, phones, etc.) that society (feminism, gay rights) are also drastically progressive. I know the genre is steampunk, but I think she was too married to the idea that steampunk has to be Victorian. Because so much was different, there was actually nothing left that made it Victorian aside from the constant date references. Since this takes place in an altogether different world, I wish she had made it in its own time without tying it to our history line. As it stands, I was just confused until I read her author's note at the end.Thank you immensely to Netgalley for providing a copy of this book.

It's the moment, he decided, when you're no longer a child. When the concept of time and the need for more of it come together and make you powerless. Make you yearn for the longer days, the lazy days, before you knew what time passing actually meant.\n\nI won't beat around the bush : Tara Sim created \n  an imaginative and thoroughly fascinating world\n in which Time needs magical towers to flow smoothly, and whose mechanics are given a highly important task, that is to say : repair and take care of the towers of time. I won't lie, but my biggest fear starting Timekeeper was my usual... distaste... for steampunk. I know, I know. Who hates steampunk?? Well. Me? I'm not sure if I was very unlucky, but almost all of these kinds of books left me utterly bored and uninterested. No such thing with Timekeeper : \n  from the beginning I was enchanted by all the details Tara Sim incorporated into her world\n, and I cannot wait to learn more about it in the sequel (I HAVE SO MANY QUESTIONS OKAY?).\nI was in an accident. I got out. I'm safe now.Was he really ?\nFirst of all : \n  I really liked Danny. A lot\n. Once again, because somehow I love being wrong, or something, I had convinced myself I wouldn't enjoy him after reading reviews saying he was one-dimensional. \n  I strongly disagree.\n On the contrary I was pleasantly surprised by all the layers his character slowly showed, and I really appreciated the representation on PTSD and anxiety. Indeed Danny, the youngest mechanic of London, has been struggling to handle the aftermaths of both a working accident and his father's disappearance. He starts so sad and withdrawn, so riddled with guilt that I couldn't help but cherish every one of his smiles. Truly, I did not expect to care so much about him, but by the end I wanted to hug and protect that boy.Moreover, in my opinion \n  the dynamics between the characters were really well-done, especially when it comes to friendships and family\n (I'll talk about the romance later). His special bond with Cassie, his best-friend, and his complicated relationship with his mother were well explored and seemed genuine. And what can I say about his father, for whom I felt so strongly despite his absence ?Several secondary characters could have benefited from gaining more layers, though, and did appear \n  a bit stereotypical\n. However, I've heard that the sequel took care of this flaw, and it makes me even eager to read it (when the kindle version will be cheaper, though /sad face/).\n\nTime is the language of all things. It is everything you see, hear, touch. Treat it carefully.\n\nI enjoyed the way the story enfolded for the most part : \n  thanks to the simple but compelling writing, I was easily engrossed\n and never felt the need to put away my book. That's rare these days, alright ? The plot managed to \n  surprise me\n when I thought I knew where the story was going, especially in the second half. I don't quite know what I expected, but \"being hooked and breathless all of a sudden\"\nwasn't it\n. Good job, Tara Sim. You definitely got me here. *bows*My only complain through the book was \n  the (m/m) romance that I found rushed and a bit unconvincing.\n Nevertheless, I wouldn't say that Danny and Colton's relationship resorts to instalove either, and I won't say why because that's a spoiler *winks*. All the same, it took me a lot of pages to actually care about them as a couple but in the end, it didn't matter. \n  The emotions I felt in the end - they baffled me.\n Truly. I might not have been the number one stan of their romance, but they convinced me and I cannot wait to see them grow together in the next book.Finally, I did feel like Timekeeper relied a little too-much on Deus ex-machina, especially in the end, but... the possibilities, friends! \u00a0That particular development created \n  so many interesting opportunities for the sequel that I can't be bitter about it.\n It's been so long since I've read about such refreshing world-building that I really couldn't care less if some actions seemed\u00a0guided. I enjoyed it all the same.\nBottom word\n : albeit not flawless, Timekeeper was fun and offered me a few hours of escape so if it looks like your thing, please give it a chance. \n  4 stars out of 5\n.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n  TW -\n PTSD, anxietyFor more of my reviews, please visit:"}, {"userName": "Laura", "userReviewDate": "Jun 20, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5382856-laura", "userReview": "I may be biased, as I am her literary agent...but it's truly amazing.

Check, check and check!This book is a thrilling journey into a Victorian-era world, where time is magic and the clock towers that measure it are under threat from a mysterious source. Without the steady beat of time, life will stall and entire communities of people will cease to exist. This is the daily anxiety that clock mechanic, Danny Hart, finds himself under.This was an utterly thrilling and original story that had great individuality, world-building and plot. The characters, especially main character Danny Hart, felt real and were memorable, and the twists and turns the story took the reader on were unprecedented.Despite this, there was a little too much focus paid to the romantic aspects of the plot, and I felt these sections elongated with declarations of romantic intent and descriptions of burgeoning feelings. I found the budding relationship incredibley sweet, but I would have preferred the primary focus of the plot to eventually shift away from these aspects and back onto the plight of the people. The plot lines did converge and the romance had a place in the story, but, for me, I didn't fully gel with the prominence of it.This was the only negative I could muster concerning this innovative book, but, alas, it was a major one for me, making this not exactly suited to my preferences."}, {"userName": "Katerina Kondrenko", "userReviewDate": "Oct 09, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36306002-katerina-kondrenko", "userReview": "5 out of 10\n\u0420\u0435\u0432\u044c\u044e \u0432 \u043c\u043e\u0435\u043c \u0431\u043b\u043e\u0433\u0435/This review on my blogLiving A Thousand Lives (please use Chrome/Yandex browser or Android/IOS to see the page; otherwise, spoiler-tags I use to make my post compact may not work)Genre: AU, fantasy, YA, queersStuff: clock towers and their spirits, mechanics, time itself, gaysFail: rushed romance, weak logicWOW: main idea, Danny's characterPOV: 3rd person, maleLove-Geometry: noneQuote-Core: \n\"Time is the language of all things.\"\nMaybe my expectations were too high, but the story did disappoint me.We have a world which is literally running on time. There are clock-towers, each creates its own time area, and if the tower is broken or something its area gets stopped, and people who were within are trapped forever or until the mechanism is fixed, which is impossible 'cause no one can enter the stopped zone. We also have mechanics aka Timekeepers, people who try to prevent time from stopping, people who repair clock-towers 'cause they can feel the time itself and manipulate it a bit.Our MC's name is Danny or Daniel Hart, he's living in London and already not an apprentice but a full mechanic. His father is trapped in one of the Stopped cities, he himself has been in an accident not a long time ago, but has managed to get out and save another town from being frozen. The Lead is worrying about Danny and try not to push him hard. Instead, he sends him in Enfield to fix its tower which had to be easy and smooth. And it was, even with Daniel being under pressure and afraid of repeating his recent experience again. But the thing is, the tower keeps having problems and Danny is going there way to often. Why? The clock spirit fell for the new mechanic and wants him around. This is how our story starts.You're up to mysterious bombing, people's protests, first and forbidden love, gay cuteness and stuff. And an alternative Victorian London with telephones, cars and queers being free to be themselves. Alas, it didn't work for me. At all.\n\n\nFirst of all, I couldn't grasp the soul of the picture, couldn't feel the atmosphere. There were to many liberties for the world to stay true to Victorian era and too little unique details to become something more and alive. That could be any epoch with the same nuances the author explained in the end of the book.The world-building is interesting, but raw. I like the idea of time being very essential for people to live and the live itself to be normal, but there are weird threads in this network. When cities are Stopped they supposed to be frozen in time and at first it seem like that, but then we see that people can chat, move and do something inside a damaged territory. For them time flows differently, but it flows. But what about the meaning of the word 'stopped'? These areas called Stopped, not Slowed. So this circumstances look like a plot-tool. It was handy for the final.I have no idea why people were protesting against mechanics and clock-towers. They wanted to get rid of both and time to be free, but how did they imagine the process? They knew that without towers their time-zones would just stop, they knew that mechanics just fix the towers and not try to change the pacing of time. Why rocking the boat everyone's in?The romance was very rushed. It's not a slow-burn, it's not a well-developed and nicely warmed-up thing. It's instalove with a few anticlimactic love-interactions. As if the author had no patience and lost it every time her MCs were around each other. Even the forbidden vibe couldn't help the deal. I didn't felt nothing.Clock spirits are interesting creatures, but we know nothing about their appearance. Why do they look like humans? And feel like them? And have the same desires? Why do they have almost real bodies?The characters weren't fleshed-out properly. Only Danny as the teller of the story had something on his pockets, but that's not enough.\n\n\nThere were things I did like, though. Otherwise, I would'd give the book 5 stars.The detective line was nice. Canonical, but reasonable. I liked how the author represented Danial's relationship with his mother, her grief and their problems. Same about Danny's post-traumatic syndrome. It looked believable. Yeah, unfortunately, that's it. All in all, I don't even know whether I'll continue with the series or not.

I\u2019m feeling really disappointed as I\u2019m writing this review. I was really hoping that I would love the hell out of this book. It\u2019s LGBT, it takes place in an alternate Victorian era, and it had a sliver of a mystery thrown into it. But sadly it was B-O-R-I-N-G. I enjoyed the romance between Danny and Colton, but the story kept dragging on and on and on and nothing seemed to be picking up until about 300 pages in and that is not a good thing. I liked the story surrounding clock spirits and there were tiny bits of this book that I did like, I will say that. I\u2019d also never read anything to do with steampunk before and so this was my introduction to that too and I\u2019m now more interested in that sub-genre and will be checking it out.  I was truly hoping that the \u201cmystery\u201d in this would save it for me (because you all know I love my Victorian era mysteries) mysterious clock tower bombings in an alternate Victorian era? It sounded awesome as hell but in the end it fell flat and though I really wanted to, I couldn\u2019t bring myself to enjoy the entire book and sadly I won\u2019t be carrying on with the trilogy. If you\u2019ve been wanting to check it out I\u2019d say borrow it from the library and then decide if you want to buy a copy or not.

Danny is broody and moody and kinda prickly and Colton is a cinnamon roll ghost and I did lots of *squishy-hands* and bosom-clutching.

I know that if I were to put on my more critical eyes and reread this story I would be able to pluck out a few things to complain about but, at this moment, I\u2019m sitting here and beaming because I fell in love with these characters and this world too much to complain. The characters were just so perfect. Danny, our protagonist, was written so incredibly well. His anxiety and PTSD - following an accident which nearly caused his death - was portrayed perfectly. He was raw and rough at the edges but it made him such a real character in my eyes. I loved that he had a hidden strength inside him that we got to see develop across the story and that his struggles (especially because he was also grieving the loss of his father) were also given proper attention. He really came to believe in himself by the end of the story and well-written character growth/development is my favourite thing of all time (so that made me super happy)! Danny\u2019s short fuse did irritate me a little at times though. He made some impulsive decisions on a few occasion that made me shake my head but I was simultaneously pleased that he flawed enough to give him depth as a character.Colton was such a little cinnamon roll. If you love August from This Savage Song, you\u2019ll love Colton all the same! They both have this magical quality to them - after all, Colton is a clock spirit - but he still managed to have this wholesome human side to him as well. I loved that Colton was a little naive and uncertain at times. It was realistic that he didn\u2019t have a big, vibrant or dominating personality seeing that he had lived by himself for a very long time and had never even left his tower before/experienced life beyond its borders. I love his thirst for knowledge and stories and that that he also had this slightly alarming, primal side to him as well (like we saw when he got jealous). It reminded us that we could never quite forget that he wasn\u2019t quite human. Both the platonic and romantic relationships in this book were handled so well. Danny\u2019s relationship with Cassie was on point. I always love seeing a believable f/m best friendship with no hints of romance. Cassie was so supportive of Danny and, as a whole, she was quite a lovely addition to the story\u2019s cast. I hope she gets even more of a spotlight in the sequel. The romance was also just\u2026 Colton and Danny were literally the most adorable little things! The development of the relationship was perfectly paced but I also loved seeing their struggles, as cruel as that sounds. Colton\u2019s nature as a clock spirit came with a lot of difficulties and they both had to compromise to make their relationship work. It was nice to see them both work through their problems and I cannot wait to see how it is going to fair in the sequel. The storyline was just fascinating. It's based on the premise that time itself is tied to physical clock towers. Time can be fractured, twisted, manipulated and even Stopped if you tamper with your local clock tower, meaning that if you were to steal a numeral from a clock face that hour would actually go \u2018missing\u2019 in time too - as in, time would skip from one o\u2019clock to three o\u2019clock if you stole the two. I don\u2019t know about you but I have never read a concept like this before. I found it absolutely fascinating! I loved that it intertwined with this new mythological lore and that, as a result, time always played a monumental role in shaping English culture. Exploring this world was so illuminating and enthralling. I was hungry for answers so the fact that our protagonist, Danny, was a clock mechanic (which allowed us to explore the clocks further) worked perfectly. There was never a moment where I was bored or lost. I was completely glued to my seat, flipping through this story with ease. It was a definite page-turner.The one thing that I think could have been improved upon is the time setting. The Victorian era is a rich period of history and somehow this story didn\u2019t quite capture its atmosphere like I would have hoped. What the author said in the author's note was perfect and solved so many queries I had but at the same time, I think this story may have worked better if it had been set in a fantasy world that drew inspiration from the Victorian era instead. Some of the liberties the author had to take were just a little too far-fetched and combined with the fact that this story had magical creatures of a sort - clock spirits - it just would have made more sense for the story to have a unique world as its setting.Overall?This was such a fun and delightful read. It was gritty and raw at the same time as being entertaining and feel-inducing. I loved all of the characters and the plotline. I struggled with some aspects of the world-building but as a whole, I\u2019m thoroughly impressed with Sim\u2019s storytelling. For a debut author, she has so much potential and I hope to see more works of her out soon - both within this world and outside.Review copy provided by the publisher for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Stacee", "userReviewDate": "Oct 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7359586-stacee", "userReview": "I had heard about this on Twitter and loved the premise, so I was quite excited to start.

Hands down, the best part of this story is the world building. I love the idea of clock spirits and London is my favorite place in the world, so I was half in love with the book before I even started.

Throughout the 408 pages there wasn't a single dull moment which kept me soo engaged! The plot was fast paced and the writing style flowed really well and was very light and easy to understand. Regarding character development i am a bit unsatisfied :/ if it had more it would have def been one of those character driven books (like the TRC series which omg my love!) but nevertheless it was great! The romance was nice and subtle not rushed whatsoever and soo cute! I soo loved that; there were moments i was soo endeared <3 and the theme of friendship was strong which i also love in stories! I am really hoping we get to see more of that in the next books! The end was indeed satisfying not a huge cliffhanger but still leaves you wondering which is good! I went into this book thinking there was time travel involved but nope unfortunately..

Danny's father has been trapped for the last three years in a town with a clock tower that was destroyed stopping the time within the town so that no one can cross in or out. When Danny is sent to Enfield to fix the tower he finds that it seems to be forever plagued by more and more problems. What Danny finds is that the boy that he thought was his new apprentice has actually been the spirit of the clock tower that likes having Danny around so he's been causing his own problems with his tower. Danny knows falling in love with a clock spirit is forbidden but he finds himself more and more drawn to Enfield and when a series of bombings start happening at other towers Danny vows to protect Enfield's tower. The first book in the new Timekeeper series takes place in a sort of alternate Victorian era London and surrounding cities where these clock towers control the cities and time. One of the things I found with this book is I had a bit of trouble grasping the world in which the author was trying to create. This is taking place in the late 1800's in and near London but the characters have access to things like automobiles and telephones which seemed a bit weird to me. For me I think I would have preferred a new fantasy city/world being created instead of a known city and time so that it didn't seem that things weren't fitting the era. While I understood the idea it just kept seeming a bit off to try to remember the time and setting and mix it into a fantasy. I did however enjoy the plot and the characters in this one with one exception. The idea of a stopped city was also a bit off with the description given when the characters actually encountered one themselves. Supposedly time stops within which would seem like nothing could occur but that wasn't what was actually happening so that seemed an odd term to me. I kept thinking shouldn't we just be referring to it as a broken city or something along that line where time is off and the characters can't escape. In the end I decided on 3.5 stars for this first book of the series. Even with the little details I've mentioned though this was still an interesting start to this series and I would continue to see what happens in the later books.

It's definitely testament to just how good this book is that I managed to devour it in one go on a train the morning after an A&E nightshift. So good that I almost missed my connection\u2026oops\u2026Danny is a young clock mechanic in an alternate London where the only thing keeping time flowing are enormous clock towers spread throughout the land. The failure of a tower causes time to grind to a halt, forming a bubble of stopped time which no one can pass into. It is effectively a death sentence, caught forever more in a stuttering loop of time only a few seconds in length. In the not too distant past Danny lost his father, himself also a mechanic, to a 'stopped' town. More recently still Danny was in a clock accident where he was almost caught in a loop of his own. Anxious and afraid, but trying to build himself back to working on the clocks he loves, Danny is sent to fix a clock in a rural market town outside of London. There he meets Brandon Summers, his new clock apprentice, a young man with a smile that makes his heart stutter. Barely a handful of days later Danny is brought back to the rural tower to investigate potentially willful damage against the clock. Here he meets another young man who also claims to be Brandon Summers\u2026utterly oblivious to who is standing behind him, with a grin like morning sunshine. The young man that made Danny so swoon only days before. With an injury to his body that curiously mirrors the damage to the clock face\u2026Danny knows now that he is in serious trouble\u2026This story is deathly cute. The romance is gorgeous. There are parts that will genuinely make your heart skip a beat. For me, it's immediately become a book that I want to foist on any and all who will listen because I just want you all to feel the warm fuzziness (and periodic sheer terror) that this story brought me. It is the book equivalent of a warm morning with lazy sunbeams, though in places my heart decided it liked to sit in my throat. The ending is very, very tense I warn you. The book is set in a 19th Century Britain which is a little more technologically advanced than our own was in the same time period, with the invention of air ships and early steam powered automobiles making the world a lot more open. Think steampunk-lite, but with more flowers and village greens. Sim actually has written a little history of her world and the things she decided to change from our world at the back of the book. I love hearing her thought process for designing her world. Now, onto our two protagonists. One thing that really struck me, and that I really enjoyed, is that Danny knows that he is gay before he meets Colton, the love interest. Speaking as a bisexual reader, It was really refreshing to not have another romance overly preoccupied on the protagonist 'coming to terms' with being queer. I mean, those books have their own purpose but not every queer love story needs sexuality angst running throughout it. Heterosexual love stories can focus solely on the joy of falling in love, it's really nice to see a LGBT romance being allowed to do the same. Sim also makes the decision to place the love story in a world where being queer was never met with the same levels of puritanical hatred and violence as in our own. I do think that was an important decision, as an LGBT person, it can be wearing to read books where people like you are constantly subjected to derision or danger. We deserve a little escapism too. Here we have a romance that is wonderfully tender and gentle, it truly is a young love story. Warm and deeply emotionally satisfying, every intimate scene between them is filled with sunshine and light. Just thinking about it makes me smile. As with the rest of the book, their story is filled with a fairy tale quality perfect for dim autumn days with short hours of sunlight and a warm cup of tea. It brings the glow even when there is no light around it. So, I guess what I am trying to say is that I can't wait for you all to read this. It's a quick gentle read, doesn't require a tonne of effort or a certain emotional state. In fact I'd say it's the perfect book to read if you're sick and feeling some of the less enjoyable effects of autumn. I just loved it and can't wait for you all to get a hold of a copy for yourselves! Thank you so much to Skyhorse Publishing and Netgalley for a copy in return for an honest Review.
