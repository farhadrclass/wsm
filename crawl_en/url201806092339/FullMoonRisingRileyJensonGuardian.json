I seriously regret buying all nine books in the series, because I couldn't even finish this first one. They're going to the second-hand bookstore TOMORROW, lol - no way in hell am I wasting another minute of my life on Riley Jenson and Co.There's so many things about this book that put me off, but the biggest one would have to be the superficiality ... there's no depth, whatsoever, to ANYTHING - and this makes it very difficult to connect to the characters or the storyline. No emotions, no nothing. What? I've just been shot? That's okay, I'll just do an instant shift into werewolf form, then back to human form, then - what do you know?! - instant healing!! - problem solved. Love?? Who needs that?! In my world, werewolves are overcome with the need to MATE for a quarter of every month. Yeah, we just have sex with everyone, all over the place. Sex. Sex Clubs. Sex. Sex Clubs. Sex. Sex Clubs. Sex Clubs. Sex. Sex. Sex. What? You're a nasty scum-type clone-freak trying to rape me with your barbed penis? OMG! I'm so freaking horny! But NO I'm going to use my super powers of awesome to make you have sex with your partner in crime, THEN make you sit down and stare blankly at the wall. Oh yeah, as for those powers of awesome, I just have them. So many of them. I'm just absolutely freaking amazing.While I have no problem with a lot of sex in books, it just gets on my nerves when characters are sleeping with MULTIPLE people they have absolutely no feelings for, for some stupid contrived reason. I MUST HAVE SEX ALL WEEK!!! SEX! SEX! SEX! SEX! Meaningless sex is just - well - MEANINGLESS. It serves no purpose in this story, apart from filling the pages with sex. It's one thing when it's between two people who have feelings for one another, or are in some sort of situation where it makes sense, but when people are just sleeping with each other for the sake of it, it's just stupid. What? My twin brother's missing? Too bad! I must have sex! Then I must have more sex with another guy. Then I'm thinking about sex with the random vampire stranger trying to help me find my brother. Then I'm turned on by the bad-guy clones, or whatever the heck they are, then MORE sex with the guy who SO OBVIOUSLY drugged me the other day and sliced out my contraceptive chip because he's obsessed with having my baby, yet I'm Too Stupid To Live because all I can think of is SSSSSSEEEEEEXXXXXX!!!I didn't even get half way and she's already had sex about 10 times ... it's all she thinks about ... it's all everyone does ... SEX! SEX! SEX! SEX! My god. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.As for the plot? Please. It's so freaking boring and hardly makes any sense at all. Clone this. Experiment that. Genetics blah blah. Interesting? NO.Also, everyone has so much MONEY! Ferrari this, multi-billionaire that ... but - hey - no big deal, Riley's had sex with rich guys before. *nods* She sure has. She only mentions this about FIVE ZILLION TIMES.Anyway, I have a feeling that if you like Adrian Phoenix's series - the one with Dante the OMG AMAZING GOD-LIKE CREATURE - you might just enjoy this one."}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Jun 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2295424-mel", "userReview": "Reading Full Moon Rising left me confused. I\u2019m not sure how to rate this book: I\u2019m torn between a 2 and a 3 star rating.There\u2019s one thing I am pretty sure about, though: miss Keri Arthur sure loves her heroine. Maybe she had a very strict and conservative upbringing or maybe she was an extremely insecure and overweight wallflower during puberty. Whatever the reason, it seems like she\u2019s been living out her fantasies through her protagonist. Riley Jenson is fan-ta-bu-lous, apparently. She is the center of attention, loved and lusted after by everyone, because she\u2019s pretty, sweet, tough and smart. She proves the latter within the first chapter of the book by wearing 6 inch heels on the job in stead of 8 inch heels, because those are \u2018easier to run with\u2019. Atta girl!Other than that, quite frankly, she didn\u2019t make very well thought out decisions. What she did do, however, was run around semi naked (or completely naked) throughout more than half of the book. The other half she was having sex. And doing stupid things. Mostly simultaneously. Writers being head over heels with their protagonists are a big no-no for me. Another thing I don\u2019t like is bad and/or illogical world building. Riley's world seemed really interesting in the beginning. There were several supernatural communities and the fresh take (well, maybe not so \u2018fresh\u2019) on vampires was nice. But as the book progressed and we learned more about the world Riley is living in, things stopped making sense. My biggest peeve being the whole \u2018moon craze\u2019 thing. While it was the perfect means for having Riley prance around naked and horny for most of the time, it did take away the credibility. Whatever your beliefs, there\u2019s no denying that natural selection ensues that a species\u2019 traits is based on survival, not the opposite. Having werewolves follow their sexual instinct for a week per month (in which they lose all morals, control and not to mention: common sense) is a sure way to get a species extinct within no time. Still, in Arthur\u2019s world, werewolves have been around for centuries. In relative secrecy even, until recently. Another thing that seemed illogical was the fact that the different species of the supernatural community didn\u2019t know much about each other, even basic stuff like general powers and longevity. The secondaries in the book were pretty one-dimensional. The scary vampire, the asshole boyfriend and of course: Quinn. Quinn\u2019s hotness is pretty much shoved down our throat but by the end of the book, I can\u2019t really say I\u2019m interested to read more about him. In spite of all my ranting, I can say that the writing in general was pretty okay. But due to my annoyance with Riley and the lack of logic, I couldn\u2019t really enjoy the book. But since this is a first in the series: I\u2019ll be mild and round up my rating to three stars."}, {"userName": "Navessa", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18104163-navessa", "userReview": "I finished this book a week ago and didn't write a review straight away so now all my feels are gone.

Between reading all 6 books of this series one after another, forgetting to get up in the morning to go to work (i don't know does it count as forgetting, if you have 4 alarms and you don't hear any of them because you were awake reading till 5.40 am and had to get up at 8) and then realising it makes more sense to stay home and read until all the books are over, i think I've lost perspective on other important things in life. Like making sure there's enough coke, juice, and food in the apartment. There's only so many days (10 days) you can live on instant noodles and 9 month old dark chocolate.So, coming to the book. The book was better than the blurb described it to be.This one is about a bitchy smart mouthed werewolf Riley who works for the Directorate which is an agency that looks at all the non-human affairs. She a dhampire (funky name, Yes) which is a cross breed between a Werewolf and a vampire. Her brother is kidnapped and she's in heat.

Physically strong, but emotionally normal. Identifiable. Believable.And then the entire book goes to hell.Instead of focusing on the fact that her twin is missing for the first half of the novel, Riley puts on a brave face and gets on with the day-to-day. Huh? Why isn't she curled up in a ball sobbing? Why isn't she taking off the heads of people getting in her way to find him? Why isn't this taking up her every waking moment? Because she is horny - that's why. The moon is calling to her, so she must have sex right now, and I mean rightnowmusthaveGRR. In Arthur's world, all werewolves spend a week a month having non-stop sex with anyone until they meet their one-true-love. Uh-huh. Sure. How very practical.But whatever. So she is sleeping around while searching for \"the most important person in her life\" - I can get over that. My issue is with the, er, three (?) times Riley was forced to have sex because she was drugged/kidnapped/on a mission. Apparently, this is only slightly unacceptable in Riley's deluded mind. Why? Because with the insane plot device that is the \"moon heat\" she would have been unable to say no anyways. So really, it isn't too big a deal.And when it's all over, is she overcome by her desire for revenge? Nope. When she is betrayed, physically and emotionally, by people she trusted for years - does she feel the need to visit a shrink and let all her emotions pour out? Of course not - that would be completely against her lack-of-character.Honestly. Despite 300-odd pages in her POV, I don't know Riley. One minute she is all touchy feel \"oh gosh, I hate to kill\"; the next she is eagerly dressing up as a prostitute while psychically forcing two guys to rape each other (and no I don't care if they deserved it). What was going on in that fictional brain of hers, who knows.

Riley is half vampire and half werewolf. But her werewolf side is dominant from her vampire side. Riley despises vampires, and it still boggles her mind about what her brother Rhoan does. He works for the\u00a0Melbourne\u2019s Directorate of Other Races, this organization is basically the police force for supernatural creatures. But when Rhoan goes missing on his latest mission, she knows that something is wrong. That Rhoan is alive but has been taken by someone., Riley is shocked when Rhoan's friend and a vampire shows up on her front door. What is worse, is that Riley is about to go through the \"Moon Heat\" a weeklong affair, where the full moon affects her body in a carnal way. Thankfully she has two partners already available, but while on the hunt for her brother. But who she really craves is Quinn, the vampire that heats her blood like none other.In Full Moon Rising I was highly impressed with this story. This is a author I have heard many things about, but haven't read her...until now and I can tell you right now that this won't be my last read from her. This one was a bit more sensual than I was expecting, but the scenes were pretty short but plentiful. What I enjoyed the most was Quinn and Riley and seeing the beginning's of their relationship. We see how much they are beginning to care for each other, even though a relationship can never happen. Quinn was recently betrayed by a wolf that he was in love with. And he will never risk himself ever again. I really liked Riley as the main feature of the story. We see her spunk and her charming personality. She isn't afraid to have sex when she has the need for it...she isn't ashamed of who she is. But we also see how much she craves a mate as well, someone to share a life with and have children with. So even though she is a bit brazen at times....she was refreshing and I am eager to see her in the rest of the series.Overall this was a wonderful book and this one left me excited to try out book 2 especially with a bit of a cliffhanger, not to the story but to the romance, and since I like my HEA....it seemed like a cliffhanger for me. But in all honesty...I truly felt swept away into this story and I couldn't get enouhg. Job well done Keri Arthur....you have me hooked.\n[foogallery id=\"19300\"]"}, {"userName": "Chiara Cilli", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10589022-chiara-cilli", "userReview": "Un concentrato di azione e irrefrenabile passione!Oh, il mio cuore.

Oh... ohhh, Keri Arthur! La sua scrittura \u00e8 qualcosa di SUBLIME che ti prende all'amo e ti lascia andare solo all'ultima parola. Il suo stile narrativo \u00e8 SUPERBO, descrittivo nei punti giusti \u2013 quando c'\u00e8 da esplorare, annusare, percepire \u2013 e cos\u00ec fluido. Una prosa unica e additiva!Sono passati sette anni da quando mi tuffai per la prima volta nel mondo senza freni e inibizioni della fantastica Riley Jenson.

Ogni lupo pu\u00f2 scegliere di avere pi\u00f9 compagni, ma quando trover\u00e0 la sua anima gemella e grider\u00e0 il suo nome alla luna, giurer\u00e0 di essere fedele a lei soltanto e si legher\u00e0 a lei per la vita.

Action packed suspense! Full Moon Rising is a crossbreeding of J.D Robb meets Anita Blake meets Mercy Thompson! This book is positively FABULOUS and I'm super excited about reading the book that is *glances to my right* waiting ever so impatiently for my sweetest attention <3This is a new author and (duh) new series for me. All of the characters are fresh in my brain ... I am being seduced by them as we speak and anxiously await the full sacrificial wave of dreams that will hopefully! ... undoubtedly! ... wake me panting o.O*grin*Full Moon Rising is the first book in the Riley Jenson Guardian series; therefore I will be giving you details about what I have come to know thus far... Even though I have noticed that at times I speak my mind .. I am proven \"wrong\" .. Hey it happens!Not often.But it does!Riley Jenson, a half-breed of werewolf and vampire, the twin to the badass Guardian, Rhoan ... and an erotic dancer of the moon's pull ... She is fun and awesome. I hate comparing .. But I really like this book and I'm going to try and put her into perspective for possible addicts! It's like Anita on valium .. but Mercy on X and revenge. Where does that leave us? With a woman who is sexually confident, betrayed by bastards in her life and does what is needed to .. well the means justify the end, right?She's excruciatingly lonely in a crowded room, a sad character who does not make friends easily ... this leaves her undying loyalty to a fault and somewhat blinds her to the creepy crawly asswipes lurking in the shadows with knives in their hands!There are so many wonderful characters .. Hmm. I'm not sure how to \"go there\" without \"going there\" ...spoilers suck!Skipping characters!This book takes place in the future without the J.D. Robb vroom vrooming. There are ancient vampires, although rare. There are crossbreds, although highly improbable. There is a paranormal section of the law that ... well the seek out and handle what needs handling without bothering to let the \"real\" world know about the bloodshed.Rhoan is kidnapped! A friend goes missing ... A vampire warned and warning Riley to keep her distance, and a handful of potential hot and dripping sexy lovers that quite honestly .. well I hope I dream about the club dance scene tonight!Laurell K. Hamilton is one of my favorite authors. Keri Arthur has excellent potential to wiggle herself onto a higher shelf (the one my toddler should never be able to reach .. cross your fingers!) where she will remain safe and sound. I have high expectations and I sincerely .. I truly hope that Kissing Sin, the second book in this series, keeps me smiling! (I'm 26 pages in and I'm already sick of this review... as it is taking time away from reading!)This book takes off with a BANG .. You do not even have to read 5 pages before being seduced into Riley's world .. She's brilliant and I'm looking forward to more. I recommend this book to mature adults only .. awesome violence scenes although not entirely too eyeball oozing worthy. Fantastic sexual content .. frequent .. descriptive .. but brief enough to allow the actual story to stay at the front row.~happy reading!"}, {"userName": "Katyana", "userReviewDate": "May 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1891730-katyana", "userReview": "Ugh.Seriously, ugh.This reads like an Anita Blake novel, very late in the series when things had devolved into constant sex with only a thin approximation of plot.

If the sentence \"I didn't really want him to touch me, but the way I was burning right now, I might have no choice\" (or something similar) occurred less than 20 times in this book, I'd be shocked.

I loved her writing style! It was both dark and gritty and very in your face! I know a lot of people think Riley is a ho, but I\u2019m going stand my ground and say that I really liked her! I\u2019ve read plenty of Urban Fantasy books before this and not all of the heroines grabbed my attention like Riley did. She was funny, smart and unapologetically sexy! She\u2019s a hybrid mix of vampire and werewolf, with her wolfy side a little more prominent. This fact makes her more susceptible for the moon\u2019s calling. Like a succubus needs sex to survive, Riley needs sex to fight bloodlust during the full moon. But Riley isn\u2019t the only one who is a freely sexual being. Werewolves celebrate with sex and so it\u2019s not so much a sex crazed thing as it is a way to survive. That being said, her twin brother Rhoan has his own love affair going on with Liander. I love these two! They are so amazing! Riley has a lot of sex in this book, but they\u2019re short scenes that are not as explicit as I initially thought it would be, given that others called her the next Anita Blake. The only prolonged, explicit love scenes are between Riley and Quinn, her love interest. Her scenes with Talon and Misha aren\u2019t as thorough and are quite short and I think they were necessary for what Arthur has planned. I don\u2019t want to spoil anything, so read it to find out! And then there\u2019s Quinn whom I just adore! He makes such a grand entrance with his dirty birthday suit! He acts like a gentleman, but I\u2019m sensing that there\u2019s more to him than meets the eye. I\u2019m interested to read more about him and Riley.

If you took Underworld and mixed it in a pitcher with Laurell K Hamilton's Anita Blake series, then threw in a slew of references to his bulging manhood heat and several ice cubes of \"for all intents and purposes\" which every character said at least once (I dislike phrases repeated over and over again) then you've got this book. If you want a lot of werewolf free sex/rape action by/on a really stupid heroine then this is the book for you! While Riley did wise up at the end, at the beginning you just want to slap her for her \"What like, one glass of champagne doesn't make someone pass out? You mean he like date raped me? No way... gee..\" She wakes up being told they had sex all over the house and she wasn't conscious for any of it. Apparently she makes the comment that she can't hold her (1) glass of \"fancy champagne.\" Jesus werewolf lady. Are you really that stupid? You think that the effect champagne has on someone is to black out and have sex for 8 hours? Your an idiot. My opinion is that if the reader can see the punchline coming (and has not been privy to any info/conversations that the main character hasn't) yet the main character can't, then the author has insulted me by making a heroine that stinking dumb.

It was fantastic. I\u2019m definitely a new Keri Arthur fan. And there are a lot in this series to keep me busy for a while. One of my favorite things about this book is Riley Jenson. She is a kick ass heroine. To me, she was a cross between Cat from Night Huntress and Georgina Kincaid. She had all of the snark that Cat has and can kick butt, but she is also a little slutty and definitely compelling and fun like Georgina. Her sluttiness would bother me if it wasn\u2019t for the fact that it ties into the Paranormal story. The werewolf mentality regarding sex is interesting: \u201cWe see sex as a celebration, something that should be enjoyed rather than something that must be hidden away behind doors and darkness.\u201d Having multiple partners and a rampant sexual appetite is just part of being a werewolf. Definitely not what is conventional in our society, but because it\u2019s just a part of their society it is acceptable.  Quinn was a great hero as well. I loved that it was more than attraction between him and Riley him but he would never admit it. He fights hard to convince himself that Riley is not the right one for him. He\u2019s really just afraid of getting hurt again. He has a past history with werewolves and will not allow himself more than a casual sexual relationship with one. I can\u2019t wait to see what happens next with Quinn. Overall, I loved the writing, I loved the characters, I loved the story and I\u2019ve already started book 2. I think this is going to be a great series. So why only a four star rating? I tend to like the Happily Ever Afters in my Paranormal Romances.

At least not by my definition. I would be more likely to call this way oversexed urban fantasy.The writing is average, the story pretty good, and the characters are interesting if not a little underdeveloped. But the core of the book (and series) is sex. It's kind of like the writer created this really interesting urban fantasy world, filled with creatures and mythology that fans of the genre will love, and then thought hmm... what is a way I could twist this so that it's perfectly okay for the main character to be a raging slut? So she made an incredibly high sex drive and incredibly low inhibitions part of the nature of the character's race, and boom, now she can have indiscriminate, emotionless sex with anyone she wants to. And she can just walk around naked all the time. It's totally cool.You get used to it after awhile, and it can be hot (although a little redundant. If you continue to read the series, you'll find that most of the sex scenes seem to have been copied and pasted in. The wording tends to be almost exactly the same from scene to scene.) The book is entertaining enough, and while I'm not a huge fan of the rampant sex, it wasn't enough to completely turn me off. I'm about halfway through the third book, and still no romance, and the writing keeps getting worse bit by bit, but the overall story keeps getting better and better, so if you're an urban fantasy fan, you will probably really enjoy this series. It's enough to keep me reading. Just wanted to warn people who thought they might be getting a love story... uh, no."}, {"userName": "Mello \u2763 Illium \u272eHarry\u272e \u2600Myrnin\u2600 Torin Ichimaru", "userReviewDate": "Jun 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6981505-mello-illium-harry-myrnin-torin-ichimaru", "userReview": "Synopsis:A rare hybrid of vampire and werewolf, Riley Jenson and her twin brother, Rhoan, work for Melbourne\u2019s Directorate of Other Races, an organization created to police the supernatural races\u2013and protect humans from their depredations.

The rating is more like 3 1/2 stars as opposed to four, but I am intrigued enough to find out what's really going on with this clones/halfbreeds mess, so I will continue on.I'm not sure how I feel about Riley as a heroine, yet. She seems fun and doesn't let what other people influence her too much. She can kick ass, too. I have no problem with her sexuality since I knew about it going into the book. Though I'm still not sure exactly how I feel about it. There were maybe some times when the sex seemed to happen at inappropriate moments. Also, I do hope that there are too many instances where Riley is on a case during the week of the full moon. I can only read about her fever rising but so many times. It reminds me of Anita and the ardeur before she got more control over it. Only in this series, moon lust is such a part of what makes weres, weres that I'm sure it will be a prominent theme in the series.

Why? Because I'm going to be forced to continue the series. I really did enjoy the characters. I love the relationship of Riley with her brother and her boss. I even like the vampire. (I know, right? That makes this book truly special . . . )The plot - well, I did see it coming. But, really, how many places can a plot go? The world was interesting and I loved the characters. I honestly couldn't put this one down.So - why did I originally rate this one lower? Because of all the sex. Sex, sex, sex. I've never seen so much sex in a book that passes itself off as Urban Fantasy. And, seriously, as much as I'd like to classify this as erotica, the plot is really more important than the sex. But, Riley has sex with anyone and everyone. Sometimes quite literally jumping from one bed into another. But, hey, Riley doesn't even need a bed. A wall will do just fine. Ms. Arthur sets up all this sex by establishing the werewolves in this series as *needing* sex during the full moon. And, then sets the first book during the full moon, of course. I skipped over as much of the sex as possible. Which made the book much shorter. And may have played a *huge* part in what a fast read this was. I'd really like to give it 3 stars. But, I can't stop thinking about the characters. And, I'm going to want to continue in the series.

Then I find myself all sad when she does nothing more than kiss and maybe cuddle them (Poor Adrian, Poor Vlad). But in this book\u2026 she actually is able to do more with other people because of her werewolf urges from the full moon approaching, and not get labeled a slut. The only sick thing is, this is the ONE book were I think I actually like the guy she\u2019s totally going to end up with. But yeah, I normally would probably give this book only four stars, but I have been having such a dry spell with books lately, I want to give it five stars!

Some love it, and others hate it with a passion that makes me tremble in my metaphorical boots. The main issue is that the leading lady, Riley, is given a great introduction as a strong female lead, but it\u2019s all wasted. Her brother goes missing and instead of going out and moving earth and heaven to find him she's having sex. Personally, that's a big character fault and many readers who didn't like this first book stated that it was one of those PNR tropes where the magic of the world is developed so that the lead HAS to have sex. That's a huge turn off for me. So what lead me to picking up this book? A group of friends on GR with similar tastes as me loved these books. Missing great reads is something I hate to do, and so I went into Full Moon Rising with low expectations. Then I was blown away!Riley is a great lead, a werewolf/vampire half breed. It sounds cheesy (at least to me), but Arthur works out the myths around it well. Riley isn't some kind of super killer. In fact, she's a liaison for the Directorate\u2014a supernatural crime fighting department. When lives are on the line she will step up to the task, especially when her brother is missing. Riley is smart heroine with her own set of human flaws, she's resourceful. This is not one of those books where everything just falls into her lap, Riley has to work to solve the mystery and she does not always win. All this is going on as the Moon Heat is happening. Now don't snicker!To elaborate on the Moon Heat. Yes, it makes werewolves once a month have to have sex. If they don't get down and dirty with it the werewolf will go into a killing rage. The government even lets werewolves have a week off to take care of these needs\u2014which is a realistic idea for something like this. Now I thought I would have a huge problem with this in the plot line. Arthur takes a plot trop that I hate\u2014HATE\u2014and makes it realistic. Riley struggles trying to deal with the Moon Heat as she seeks her brother. It's realized enough that I don't feel like it steals from the story. It's a legitimate crisis that has to be dealt with. Also it's sooooooo nice having a lead female who isn't a virgin, or simply hasn't slept around a lot. Now, I'm not saying a want my lead to be a slut. What I'm saying is that Riley likes sex, she's not ashamed of it and I enjoy reading about a woman that is comfortable with her sexuality. Strangely enough in UF and PNR even though the women are strong they always have hang-ups or issues with sex. Arthur has clearly created an amazing Urban Fantasy world that's exceptionally fleshed out. The people, society, and the concepts are great. It\u2019s nice to read a UF set in Australia. If the paranormal creatures of legend stepped out I could believe that the government would want to create super soldiers using gene experimentation and cloning. It's great watching the politics work out. Arthur has created a wonderful mix of Urban Fantasy, PNR, mystery, and sci/fi. The legends for the myths are clear and Arthur doesn't forget it. If Riley's strength saved her from one situation, she's not going to suddenly not be able to do it a page later, or book later. Things are consistent. Sure the bad guys might get special powers because of the experimentation's and other stuff, but they're not pulling new magical rabbit tricks out of there butts. Another plus is the romance. This series is not going to be dominated by the over done love triangle. Riley has two lovers and a potential in a Vampire that appears naked on her door step. Riley might have to use her sexual assets as tools and sometimes weapons to get what she wants, but that's an asset of being a woman. Arthur is not afraid to use the power of a woman's sexuality. It's great watching Riley fall from lust to maybe love, and then watch her deal with the betrayal of a lover(s). The emotions are raw. Most of all I love how she confronts relationship issues head on. She's not one to take it laying down (um, no pun intended).This first book is edgy and very sexy. It has all the great features of a wonderful Urban Fantasy story and mixes the right kind of romance elements. PNR fans will love it and UF readers can appreciate a book that's sexy while still maintaining a plot. Everything is not solved in one book and there are plot threads that are going to carry on. Love how epic the plot arcs are. If the Moon Heat aspect of this book is what has been stopping you from trying out this series don't. Arthur has talent and she's clearly not going to let those tired old plot tricks most authors love to use muck up her book. She's got talent for world building, character depth, and so much more. Besides how can you say no to a lead who's strong, smart, and comfortable with her sexuality?Sexual Content: Honestly after the review, I don\u2019t think I need to say it! Though I do have to respond to other reviews, this isn\u2019t erotica. Not. Even. Close.4/5- Great!

Her twin brother Rhoan is the opposite, and a Guardian with the Directorate. One evening Riley senses he is in trouble, and when she reaches her home she finds a very attractive, very naked vampire on her doorstep, his memory patchy, but determined to wait for her brother to return.This is only the start of a very deep mystery involving genetic research, cloning, moon fever, shape-shifting, sex, drugs and a Dhampire (Riley) who can seriously kick some arse. She's a great protagonist, strong and fiesty but not invincible, smart and cocky but not irritating. The premise is refreshingly original, and the blend of crime, mystery, espionage and danger blends perfectly and excitingly with intense sex scenes and a deep yearning for a man who wants her but has been burned too badly by wolves in the past to want more from her.The setting and focus on genetics and mutants reminded me - in a very good way - of Dark Angel, a show I love, and the pacing is tight, the action thrilling. I do get annoyed at the way certain words and spelling are changed into American English for US editions - and why change some, like mobile (cell phone) and jumper (sweater), and leave others, like rubbish bin? It doesn't make much sense, and frankly it's pretty insulting. Besides, American books don't get changed like this when published in Australia or elsewhere, so why should ours? I really don't think Americans are so stupid they don't know what a mobile phone is.

I read the first four books back-to-back and here are some observations:1) Riley doesn't seem to have a lot of common sense/street smarts. She's intelligent, but she makes a lot of questionable decisions and trusts way too easily. There were giant red flags that came from the actions of many people in her life, yet she ignored them and merrily continued on her way. I would have liked to see her be a little less trusting and a little more wary. 2) There's a lot of sex in this book, but I wouldn't consider it an erotic romance. Though there's a lot of sex, most of it is off page. In this world, werewolves have to answer the moon's call for one week every month (which means have sex non-stop). They burn with sexual fever and, if their needs aren't met, they turn crazed. That's the way this world is written and that's fine, but the point was all but hammered into the reader. The Fever was mentioned every other page, I swear.3) This speaks more to the four books as a whole, rather than this book in particular, but the storyline really seemed to drag on. What starts here isn't resolved until book four, and even then there are loose ends that still need to be tied up. It may be because I read them back-to-back, but it ended up feeling like one, long drug out story, rather than a continuing story-arc I wanted to keep reading. The same goes for the romance angle. What seemed promising in book one was just tired by book four. 4) For all that, I do like Riley. I think she's an interesting character facing some hard battles not of her making. She keeps a good attitude and does her best to power through, regardless of what life throws at her. I also really like the secondary characters. Especially her twin, Rhoan, and his sometimes boyfriend Liander. After binge-reading four books, I'm not sure i want to continue the series. I may set the series aside and come back to it after I read some of her other books."}, {"userName": "Natasha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2496802-natasha", "userReview": "I LOVED this book. I was into it almost instantly. Some book I think.. yeah I might like this.. but with the great ones I know I'll love it right from the start. I really like how she started this book.

Riley who is the protagonist of the book. Her and her twin brother, Rhoan, have a secret: they are a combination of both Vampire and Werewolf.Natural hybrids such as Riley and her twin brother Rhoan are very rare, and not many know of their condition. Riley is strong, smart and sexy. She works with the Directorate, which polices the supernatural world. Rhoan is a guardian and as much as her boss Jack wants Riley to be one, she wants to keep herself low brow. Riley is a strong, funny redhead halfbread who has someone targeting her as prey.Synopsis:Arthur's suspenseful, colorful debut introduces readers to a world in which vampires and werepeople work side by side. Riley Jenson and her twin brother, Rhoan, have a secret: they are half vampire, half werewolf, which gives them extraordinary powers. Both are employed by the Directorate, which polices the supernatural world. Rhoan is a guardian, but Riley, wanting to keep a lower profile, is an operative. Her boss, Jack, wants to bring her into the ranks of the guardians, but she soon has her hands full when Rhoan disappears. Complicating matters is Quinn, the sexy vampire camped outside the apartment Riley shares with Rhoan, looking for Rhoan on a business matter. When Riley, Jack, and Quinn discover Rhoan's disappearance is connected to a shady company's cloning experiments, Riley isn't sure whom she can trust, especially when she learns one of her lovers may be involved in the conspiracy. Exciting fare with plenty of action, so that horror fans will eagerly anticipate the next installment in a fresh, sexy series.  All in all, I really love this book. The whole series is a favorite of mine, as is anything Keri Arthur does. I recommend this series!!! I loved the characters and the plot. It was well-paced and kept me on my toes. It has a good amount of romance and mystery and I couldn't wait for the next book. I've read all the series and am counting down the days for the newest installment in the series.

There were scenes that actually made me blush and I don't blush easily.While I don't mind sex in books, I was a bit put-off by Riley's whoring. I was appalled at certain points when she used sex as a means to get information. Only to then feel sympathy in the next scene as Riley tried to come to terms with acting like a prostitute. A means to an end. The whole Moon fever got to be a bit much but I get it\u2026 at the end Riley comes to the very sad realization that the two men she trusted as mates, weren\u2019t to be trusted at all and sex isn't everything.

I thought that this book would have an interesting plot with all the distractions of a deliciously irresistable Vampire who appears naked in front of Riley's apartment door keeping Riley from finding her twin brother who is missing. However, the plot seems more focused on the lusty scenes than the \"finding the beloved twin brother\" plot. I think that the author could have focused more on the production and development and intensity of the plot, instead of making lust the dominating theme - although I acknowledge the fact that lust is supposed to be the main theme - without incorporating most of it into the actual plot.
