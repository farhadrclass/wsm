Here are links to my reviews of the previous two books, \nThe Wreath\n and \nThe Wife\n. This book covers the final third of Kristin's life (circa 1299-1350). The final years of anyone's life is full of endings, separations and goodbyes. The same was true for Kristin. First she is separated from her younger sister due to an insult given between their husbands. Then when her brother-in-law dies her sister quickly remarries and moves to a distant estate. Then a disagreement with her husband caused him to live separately from her. He is killed when he returns to respond to a rumored scandal. Then her seven sons disperse, get married, or join a monastery. In the end she feels unwanted at her home estate and joins a convent. The story ends with her showing bravery and strong Christian faith in the face of The Black Plague. In the end she clearly deserves to be honored as a saint\u2014if she weren't a fictional character. Sigrid Undset won the 1928 Nobel Prize in Literature largely because of the Kristin Lavransdatter trilogy. The trilogy provides a well written portrayal of 14th century Norway. The following is a quotation from this book that demonstrates the ability of Undset (the author) to describe internal human thoughts and emotion. It is Kristin anticipating the fact that her sons are approaching adulthood and will soon be leaving her care. These are feelings with which most parents can identify.Was this how she would see her struggle end? Had she conceived in her womb a flock of restless fledgling hawks that simply lay in her nest, waiting impatiently for the hour when their wings were strong enough to carry them beyond the most distant blue peaks? And their father would clap his hands and laugh: Fly, fly, my young birds.They would take with them bloody threads from the roots of her heart when they flew off, and they wouldn't even know it. She would be left behind alone, and all the heartstrings, which had once bound her to this old home of hers, she had already sundered. That was how it would end, and she would be neither alive nor dead."}, {"userName": "Briynne", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94054-briynne", "userReview": "Individually and even more so when taken as a whole, the Kristen Lavransdatter novels are breathtaking. The scope of the novels is unreal; by the end, I felt like I knew this woman inside and out even though she never stopped being a mystery to me. The author follows her life from late childhood to death in sometimes overwhelming detail. The writing is weighty and challenging; Undset dives into her time period flawlessly and doesn't wait for the reader to catch up. It's hugely rewarding in a way that beach lit can't even touch. Through 1000+ pages I never really understood Kristen's devotion to Erlend, but I believed it completely. She hated him only a fraction less than she loved him, and it was a fascinating, if painful, thing to experience. I constantly ached for the ability to shake him until his head rattled; he poisoned everything and everyone around him. Kristen's sons in turns left me cold and broke my heart. I loved Naakve for his name and poor Orm, the stepson, best of all. But I felt like there were so many children, it was hard to feel for them all; interestingly, I think this may have been on purpose since the author implies Kristen lost track of a few of them as well. The most sympathetic character of the novels is undoubtedly Simon Darre. I was wrecked by Simon and he really develops into something wonderful in the final book. Of course you know that he's always loved Kristen, but the admitting of it is so horrible to watch. And Ramborg's quiet, seething envy and bitterness toward Kristen is heartbreaking. The Simon/Kristen/Ramborg triangle was definitely my favorite of the many, many story arcs.Finally, I have to mention the religious thing. I was in awe of the way Undset captures the aura of Catholicism of the 13th century. It's on nearly every page, but it's seamless and fascinating; this aspect of the story alone is enough to distance it from modern life in a very fundamental way. It was so interesting to see the play between strict, practically-felt medieval Christian ideals expressed in the novels and the actual lives of the people she portrays. So, if you didn't get it yet, I'm highly recommending this series. It's well worth the extra effort and time. Also, I understand that this translation by Tina Nunnally is much better and smoother than some previous efforts, so I am also recommending this edition in particular. Plus I think the covers are very pretty. Read these books!!"}, {"userName": "Emma Deplores Goodreads Censorship", "userReviewDate": "Apr 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229326-emma-deplores-goodreads-censorship", "userReview": "The final volume of the Kristin Lavransdatter trilogy is perhaps the best of the three. Judging by the titles and cover images, I had guessed that Kristin would spend this book as a widowed nun and that the book would be mostly about her grieving and repenting her sins. Fortunately, that\u2019s a long way from the truth \u2013 the plot picks up again after the slower and more contemplative second volume, balancing its detailed portrayal of medieval life with plenty of juicy drama.But the heart of the story is Kristin\u2019s struggle for fulfillment in her role as wife and mother. As a modern reader, it can be easy to get frustrated with Kristin\u2019s silent resentment of Erlend \u2013 you want her to either deal with the problems in the marriage or move on. But of course, she can\u2019t move on and without the possibility of divorce as an escape valve, I wonder if addressing the problems with Erlend head-on might be too dangerous; if they can\u2019t successfully resolve them, then bringing them into the open might only make their home life less tolerable. At any rate, their relationship continues to be as messy and destructive as ever. Meanwhile, in the shadow of their parents\u2019 tumultuous marriage, their sons are growing into young men, and Kristin\u2019s influence in their lives is on the wane, to her distress.Others have found this volume depressing, and yes, it\u2019s a bit melancholy. The ending is a sad one, though appropriate, and artistically (and historically) sound. But I enjoyed reading it nonetheless; the prose had a calming effect, as I was absorbed into the lives of Undset\u2019s three-dimensional characters and the richness of their world. Having finished, I\u2019m sorry it\u2019s over."}, {"userName": "Kate Howe", "userReviewDate": "Feb 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13193127-kate-howe", "userReview": "I'm just gonna crawl in a hole now and cry for several hours about this beautifully tragic story."}, {"userName": "Ahmad Sharabiani", "userReviewDate": "Sep 23, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/614778-ahmad-sharabiani", "userReview": "Kristin Lavransdatter 3: Korset=The Cross (Kristin Lavransdatter, #3), Sigrid Undset"}, {"userName": "Rebekah Leland", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5701694-rebekah-leland", "userReview": "This last book is a first-read for me.

She was a novelist that was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1928.\nHer best-known work is Kristin Lavransdatter, a trilogy about life in Scandinavia in the Middle Ages, portrayed through the experiences of a woman from birth until death. Its three volumes were published between 1920 and 1922.\nHer trilogy on the life of Kristin Lavransdatter, daughter (datter) of Lavrans, gained some new interest when her work was translated for a second time in 1997 by the award winning translator Tiina Nunnally.\u00a0The previous translation had been done in older English, and had censored a few things.The picture with the three books from different publishers is my own picture. I found them separately for a good price. When you buy them, if you are interested in getting Nunnally's translation, be sure the edition states her as the translator. The only other translation doesn't mention who did it, it only mentions Sigrid Undset as the writer.The trilogy was brought up to my attention a few years ago by a few homeschooling moms at a forum, who spoke highly of it. At that time, I read book 1, The Wreath. Impervious as I am for romance, the book felt a bit like a YA type of book. In hindsight, now that I've read the 3 books, I'd say they all have a different tone, and book one, with a young Kristin and Erlend, was full of reckless behavior, and faster paced than the other two.At the end of book 1, something moved me to go back to Medieval Norway, and keep finding out what was of Kristin's life and those around her. The Wife, book #2, didn't disappoint. This trilogy gained new heights for me. Undset kept weaving a complex yet unassuming tapestry full of characters, human emotions, history, customs, and unforgettable pictures of the Norwegian landscape. She took me there, she gave me a privilege position, -that of a fly on a wall, and I was there as Kristin had her children, and her marriage entered a new phase.After book #2, I faithfully started book #3, but life took me to different paths, and I quit after a few pages. Three years later, I decided to read the last book in the trilogy. It took me a little bit, but it all came back to me, and soon, I was once more immersed in the life of Kristin and her kin, enveloped by the air, the seasons, their comings and goings, walking towards the last stage of her life.I don't wish to talk much about the plot or characters. I would love for anyone considering the trilogy, to enter as I did, not knowing anything other than it's worth their reading investment. Now that I've read them all, I do enjoy reviews where they elaborate about Kristin and the others. But not this review, -my reviews are never too elaborate, they are simply my impressions on books, maybe some facts of interest, that's all.I know that for many, this trilogy has a special relevance since the book is also a portrayal of the catholic faith. For me, that aspect was significant as a historical depiction of Medieval Catholic Norway, and, despite of not sharing faith with Kristin nor with Undset, I appreciated being witness of Kristin's spiritual conflicts and the development of her beliefs and those around her. The spiritual facets of the book are ingrained in the life of the characters, in the times they are living. I benefited from reading it the same I do benefit and enjoy reading Dostoevsky, -even though I'm not an Orthodox christian either. Sigrid Undset must have been in love with her country. There's so much respect and admiration for Norway, its people, customs, the land.I can only say I'm glad to have traveled back in time, and to have met Kristin and the others. I closed the last page sad, but thankful for Undset's generosity. She did not spare us anything, she offered a lavish banquet, and I'm pleased to have come to her invitation."}, {"userName": "Tatiana", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/180908-tatiana", "userReview": "I loved these books. They were just heartbreaking, but so real. Why is it that some really basic truths about life are entirely non-apparent until I read a book that shows them up? What is it about fiction that can spur us to realize true things we haven't understood through living life directly? That is a mystery on par with the deepest I know. These books surely have that quality. They read exactly like real life, beautiful, heartbreaking, breathtaking; but somehow they encapsulate it in a way that brings some quanta of understanding that wasn't there before.

I had my doubts about the third book given that \"The Cross\" is the title. Set in the early medieval world; before the Reformation, the Renaissance, and, of course, feminism and secularism, I was fully prepared to be turned off by getting to a Nunnery. Much to my surprise and delight, I was so completely pulled into the mindset, time, and place of Kristin Lavrensdatter that I not only understood the arch of her character intellectually, but was also profoundly moved by it. I have very rarely had a piece of literature actually take my breath away. The first time was when, as a girl, I came to the end of Steinbeck's \"Grapes of Wrath.\" It could not have happened again, as it did with this book withou tmy having read the full thousand and sixty plus pages of the trilogy as one piece. This complicated and powerful epic story of a woman's full life took me into a medieval world very distant from mine in both time and substance. On the emotional level, however, her life was much like my own. Here in the last book, Kristin loses her central place in her family and on her estates, yet, the last stages of her life are as profound and meaningful as what came before. There are delights, surprises, and growth as she endures to the end."}, {"userName": "BookishStitcher", "userReviewDate": "Jul 18, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14045793-bookishstitcher", "userReview": "I'm so happy this trilogy is over! I wasn't sure I would be able to finish, but I did. The only good part of this book was the last 2o pages when it dealt with the historical event of the Black Death in Norway. The back of the book was kind of misleading in talking about this event like it was a big part of the book. I kept reading waiting for it and out of 403 pages that part doesn't start till 382. Basically, I would have preferred a non-fiction history book on Norway during this time than these novels with characters which I disliked."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Jun 09, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1613645-shannon", "userReview": "I finished this series today at work, and then I was left with a lot of time to think about it. There are so many things worth talking about, but what seems like it's going to stick with me the most is the role of God-given male power in Kristin's world. Book one is about the obedience Kristin owes to her father. In book two Kristin struggles with the obedience she owes to her husband, the obedience her husband owes to the king, and her feelings that she's somehow been cheated by Erlend being so unreliable; she feels that she should be able to obey him and trust his judgment at all times, but she can't. Book three is largely about her grief over how little power she has in the lives of her sons.What makes Kristin so interesting is that she believes in patriarchal power wholeheartedly, but she also never gives in to it. In a remarkable moment in the second book, her father tells her, \"You struggle like a colt that has been tied up in the stable for the first time, whenever your heartstrings are bound.\" She doesn't want to accept the traditional fate of women, to love deeply but without power. Most often the male response to her resistance is a gentle lecture about the importance of accepting God's will and not trying to act in the world. Meanwhile, all of the men live in the world, make significant decisions, and take risks, apparently feeling that it's different for them, since they act on behalf of God rather than against him. None of the book's characters seem aware of the disparity, and I'm not sure Sigrid Undset is fully aware of it either.It makes me wonder what the gender politics of Norway were like in the early 1920s when these books were written. These days Norway is tied with Sweden and Finland, and maybe Iceland, in the running for most progressive on gender issues. Back then were they on the verge of major changes like we were? I feel like these books contain some unspoken knowledge about why Kristin feels so desperate so much of the time. Undset never oversimplifies the problem. Kristin's father is a wonderful person whose integrity is never compromised, and Erlend is disappointing most of the time, but it's hard to say which of them does Kristin the most good or the most harm.In the final book Kristin stays true to her character, struggling to do important things right up to the end. Maybe Erlend's appeal comes from the fact that he does need her help. He never smothers her with too much protection."}, {"userName": "Robin", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5117973-robin", "userReview": "Others have said this is a novel of goodbyes, of closings and shutting down, and that is true. Kristen's life is winding down, and in this third book she is gradually bereft of every human relationship she once valued, from husband and sister to friend and sons. Alone, she turns to God, who remains with her. Central message of the series is delivered in that sentence. While I understand the popularity and the literary value of this series of novels, I cannot say that I \"liked\" them, because they left me just sad and a little angry rather than ever feeling delighted, hopeful, or uplifted. I found very little joy in them, and the overall spirituality was pretty depressing : basically, cling to God because you ain't got nuttin otherwise. I also struggled mightily from the very start of the series with Kristen's continued devotion to a man clearly incapable of caring for her, or even of growing up and behaving like an adult. It poisons her entire life, it poison's the lives of others from her sister (that poor girl) to her sons, and in the end, it breaks her own heart completely. I never understood her attraction to him (was it just a sexual thing at first? Then she felt like she had made her bed so she had to lie in it?) nor her refusal to throw him out given his HORRIFIC and stupid actions. This made it difficult for me to connect to her, and since the whole series is ABOUT her, I had to literally drag myself through books two and three. So, for me, not a great series, but I understand the literary value and the reason it is popular among some groups."}, {"userName": "booklady", "userReviewDate": "Oct 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/350218-booklady", "userReview": "When I closed the cover on this mammoth trilogy (1069 pages) I just sat there reflecting on the long lifespan of the titular character\u2014from the late 13th to the mid 14th century. I reread the last two pages lingeringly, not wanting the book to end. That more than anything I think is the sign of a good story; you don't want to leave it. In the book, Kristin Lavransdatter, you come to really know the woman by that name. You walk her life from earliest childhood to death in old age and even though you may not always agree with her choices, you come to understand them\u2014or at least I did. She was a very sympathetic character because, while far from perfect, she loved so deeply and passionately where she did love; she learned from her mistakes and she forgave whole-heartedly.A fascinating story which I found myself thinking about when I wasn\u2019t reading it, longing to get back to and yet hoping it would never end. The best book about the Middle Ages I\u2019ve ever read. I know why it won the 1928 Nobel Prize. I read the more arcane of the two available translations\u2014because that was the one I had.

I loved these stories and can understand why Undset won the Nobel Prize for Literature. I wish I could read them in the original Norwegian, but Nunnally's translation is an excellent substitute. I highly recommend these books if you are looking for a story of Medieval times written by a woman nearly a century ago that is still relatable today.

Beautifully written by Sigrid Undset in the 1920's of a young woman in Medieval Norway. The three volumes take her through her entire life with those around her, family and friends. I began the series hoping to learn more of the heritage of the Norwegian people my grandson will be living amongst for the next two years of his mission for The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The series was all I could have hoped for. Nobel Laureate, Sigrid Undset, described setting and characters well as the story unfolded of a full life with extended family, household and community. The landscape of the homes where she lived and traveled were described to be visualized though I've never been to Norway. The writing wasn't immediately engaging nor a page turner but rather an engaging story over time. As it became engaging I found myself pausing at times to look further online into the history, geography, mythology and culture of Norway even though each volume has a number of pages of notes that give background and understanding.

And the estrangement between Kristi and her husband, as well as other feuds between formerly close people, has the ring of realism, not in the least because they make so little sense to the observer. But near the very end of the book I felt that, in contrast to the two earlier books, the dynamic pace of the tale slowed a bit, and perhaps could have been more tightly drawn. This is a minor criticism--I loved the first two books nad if you read those you will want to follow Kristin through."}, {"userName": "Alex", "userReviewDate": "Jan 27, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/547514-alex", "userReview": "I read these books because they were my mother's favorite when she was around 13 in the early 50s. They are very long (and slow) but filled with all sorts of cool tidbits about Norway in the early 1300s (the books well researched) and a lot of drama. I was not a huge fan of Kristin, the main character, so I felt a bit less invested in the books overall. That said, I thought the author did an amazing job of taking Kristin through her life and having her grow and evolve in an extremely organic and real way. No huge plot twists, no OMG growth experiences for anyone - just real humanity. Very much liked that aspect."}, {"userName": "Desertorum", "userReviewDate": "Nov 01, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30839997-desertorum", "userReview": "All in all I would give 4 stars to this whole trilogy. This last book was maybe little bit more like 3 star read. It started kind of slowly and with lot of names and political things. Then it got better but towards the end again it slowed down. This family saga told greatly about human mind and didn\u00b4t make any of the characters \"better\" than they were. They all had their flaws and they did behave just like humans do. I really like that about this. There were no heroes in this one just people trying to survive in the middle age. Definitely worth a read."}, {"userName": "Salma", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2023961-salma", "userReview": "\u0647\u0646\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0627\u062c\u0639\u0629 \u0643\u0627\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062c\u0632\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0644\u0627\u062b\u0629https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...\u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0644\u064a\u0628: \u0641\u0647\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0632\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062b\u0627\u0644\u062b \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0643\u0631\u064a\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0646\u060c \u0645\u0646 \u0639\u0648\u062f\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0625\u0644\u0649 \u0636\u064a\u0639\u062a\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0639\u062f \u0641\u0642\u062f\u0627\u0646\u0647\u0645 \u0644\u062b\u0631\u0648\u0629 \u0632\u0648\u062c\u0647\u0627\u060c \u0648 \u0643\u0628\u0631 \u0623\u0648\u0644\u0627\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0647\u062c\u0631 \u0632\u0648\u062c\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0647\u0627 \u0648 \u0645\u0648\u062a\u0647\u060c \u0648 \u0646\u0630\u0631 \u0646\u0641\u0633\u0647\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a\u0633\u0629... \u0647\u0646\u0627 \u0623\u0635\u0627\u0628\u0646\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0623\u0645 \u0628\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u062e\u0644\u0627\u0641\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0646\u062a\u0647\u064a\u0629... \u0648 \u0628\u0639\u0636 \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0633\u0647\u0627\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0648\u0639\u0638\u064a \u0646\u0638\u0631\u0627 \u0644\u0627\u0632\u062f\u064a\u0627\u062f \u062a\u062f\u064a\u0646\u0647\u0627... \u0648 \u0644\u0643\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0633\u0644\u0648\u0628 \u0623\u064a\u0636\u0627 \u0643\u0627\u0646 \u0646\u0627\u0636\u062c\u0627 \u0648 \u0645\u062a\u0642\u0646\u0627 \u0641\u064a \u062a\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u062e\u0635\u064a\u0627\u062a \u0648 \u062a\u0646\u0627\u0642\u0636\u0627\u062a\u0647\u0627...0"}, {"userName": "Jen", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/225390-jen", "userReview": "\"Then it occurred to Kristin Lavransdatter in a new way that the interpreters of God's words were right.

The trilogy, however, is more than a journey into the past. Undset's own life\u2014her familiarity with Norse sagas and folklore and with a wide range of medieval literature, her experiences as a daughter, wife, and mother, and her deep religious faith\u2014profoundly influenced her writing. Her grasp of the connections between past and present and of human nature itself, combined with the extraordinary quality of her writing, sets her works far above the genre of \"historical novels.\" This new translation by Tina Nunnally\u2014the first English version since Charles Archer's translation in the 1920s\u2014captures Undset's strengths as a stylist. Nunnally, an award-winning translator, retains the natural dialog and lyrical flow of the original Norwegian, with its echoes of Old Norse legends, while deftly avoiding the stilted language and false archaisms of Archer's translation. In addition, she restores key passages left out of that edition.Undset's ability to present a meticulously accurate historical portrait without sacrificing the poetry and narrative drive of masterful storytelling was particularly significant in her homeland. Granted independence in 1905 after five hundred years of foreign domination, Norway was eager to reclaim its national history and culture. Kristin Lavransdatter became a touchstone for Undset's contemporaries, and continues to be widely read by Norwegians today. In the more than 75 years since it was first published, it has also become a favorite throughout the world.", "title": "The Cross\n      \n          (Kristin Lavransdatter #3)", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30171817-the-cross", "average": 4.27, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1463014118l/30171817.jpg", "reviews": 145, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4203.Sigrid_Undset", "name": "Sigrid Undset"}], "type": ["Historical", "Fiction", "Classics", "Historical"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30171817-the-cross", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6219.The_Cross", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/977350.Kristin_Lavransdatter_3", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17405457", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10806967--", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6217.Kristin_Lavransdatter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6220.The_Wreath", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6216.The_Wife", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6226.Gunnar_s_Daughter", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6218.The_Axe"]}
