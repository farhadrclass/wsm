Smoke is pursuing rustlers who've poached cattle from the Sugarloaf, Matt is after outlaws concentrating on a stage line, and Preacher is defending the Assiniboine village of an old friend, once an enemy when both were young, from attack. When the chief's daughter and grandson are taken in the raid, it's that that brings the three men together to deal with it.It's another ploy of the Indian Ring , a group of rich men and politicians intent on milking all they can from Native Americans.Plenty of action as the three men attack to rescue the mother and child and hand another blow to the Ring's greedy intentions.Recommended"}, {"userName": "Barbara Lee Wood", "userReviewDate": "Sep 21, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/56675669-barbara-lee-wood", "userReview": "THEY'RE COMINGThe Three Mountain Men are together again. PREACHER, MATT, and SMOKE. It doesn't matter what their doing or where they are, if one needs help, they finish what their doing and head out. Again ultimate power, possession and GREED are in the air. The railroad and the wealth it can bring to the manipulative attitudes that belong to a certain breed of men. The Preacher and the Jensen's brothers fought this group of evil before. The Circle of Evil, which consisted of politically powerful men living in Washington. D.C. who achieved their wealth underhandedly. Under the guise of their positions they got men to procure the investments without any references to them...sneaky bunch of snakes..sound familiar folks, it's being done...This particular Circle of Evil wanted to utilize the land that the Assiniboine Indians live on. They didn't get the land thru a treaty, but it's government land and this bully feels that these Indians are standing in his way...so annihilate them...no one cares anyway, a good Indian is a dead one...The plan is to storm the village kidnap the Chief's daughter and her son and hold as ransom. He figures since he's holding the upper hand, t h e Indians will vacate land and he can inform the powers that be to begin building the railroad. All I'm going to say is not all plans work..especially when they are devious to start with. Preacher, Jensen Brothers don't feel this way..they are unhappy that this Circle of Evil has reared its ugly biased head..look out Hammerhead, THEY are coming....NO PEACE FOR THE WICKED...."}, {"userName": "larry brashear", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41032890-larry-brashear", "userReview": "Great Story!Another fine master piece by a great story teller of the old west.

The sub-plots are more realistic than the larger part of the thesis. At least these gunfighters could miss -- and often did.The book was entertaining but predictable. One interesting tidbit; the story-line has on Jensen son coming from Colorado and the other from Wyoming -- the back cover has them both coming from Colorado. Perhaps I am too critical!Lots of cowboys and Indians and guys who love their horses -- got to be a fairly good book."}, {"userName": "Dan Smith", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8331146-dan-smith", "userReview": "Good western story of Preacher, Matt and Smoke Jensen.. how they worked together with a Indian tribe after the Chief Daughter and grandson were kidnapped.."}, {"userName": "Kenneth Jones", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43126353-kenneth-jones", "userReview": "All the books with the Preacher or Smoke Jensen are hard to beat.
