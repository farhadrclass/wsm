There is relief in hearing the expressions of desperation in the psalmist's voice. He didn't experience this life perfected, and we don't either. But the psalmist was loved. So are we.God was so kind to give us the Psalms.To walk through darkened days is part of the human experience. To walk through them with faith, comfort, strength, joy, and hope is part of the divine experience. Our eyes, though, are often clouded to those blessings by the thing oppressing us. When we remember and recognize our Father's faithfulness, when we see reality with the eyes of understanding, the darkness ebbs and the light of hope grows. The impossible, unbearable, and unthinkable becomes the hidden passageway to truth, hope, and joy in Christ.These letters were originally written as encouragement to a friend when the darkness began to overtake his path. Each day for 22 days, a letter arrived with one of the eight-verse sections from Psalm 119 along with a small thought to bring light and hope and to be a reminder that we do not fight our battles alone. The letters, along with nine more devotions on the subject of experiencing God in the dark, make up this powerful, honest, hope-filled 31-day devotional.My Review: Each day that I wake up, I still find that I need God more and more. The older that I get I feel like He is my best friend and confidant. I can trust and rely on no one but Him. When I was younger God was always an after thought but nowadays He is my main thought.  The author of God in the Dark is seems especially keen to this way of thinking, as well. She sees God in all she does not just something to do. She gets down to the heart of things. Many of the thoughts and focusing she did this this tiny book shoot straight through and can get to you in a heartbeat. She is definitely a wordsmith. This small devotional contains 31 days worth of devotions and tried and true thoughts and feelings to show you God and its just the right size for gift giving. An amazing read!**Disclosure** This book was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from the publisher.

That is exactly how I felt as I began my journey with author Sarah Van Diest in her book God in the Dark: 31 Devotions to Let the Light Back In published by NavPress. The words of this book were first written to a friend who was in great pain. Knowing that there was nothing that she could do to make the pain go away, she resorted to praying and writing him letters. Each day she would send her friend a small note with her thoughts on a section of Psalm 119. Those small notes and a few more added just for the book are what you have in this devotional read. This devotional is very personal and each day\u2019s read is short and concise. This book of 160 pages is so full of truth, encouragement, Scripture, God, hope, and faith. If I sound as if I\u2019m gushing about it, then you would be correct.I could just about tweet this whole book out, if that was possible. Of course I commend this book to you or somebody that you might know that is in a dark place right now. It is a wonderful reminder that God is always present in our darkness. The same comfort that the author sought to bring to her friend who was hurting, can be brought to you.I received a copy of this book for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Jamie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28638886-jamie", "userReview": "A Companion of Hope God In the Dark: 31 Devotions to Let the Light Back In, by Sarah Van Diest, is a welcome companion when the light of joy and hope barely flickers. For anyone who feels alone, is struggling in overwhelming circumstances, or drowning in the deep waters of pain, isolation, and suffering. This encouraging devotional gives hope and comfort to readers. Sarah Van Diest's gentle words of truth and understanding offer healing and strength to the worn, parched, empty soul. She writes with intention, thoughtfulness, and purpose, pointing readers to the light of God's never-ending love and presence. I very highly recommend God In the Dark. It's a book that is a healing balm for the soul, and a wonderful book to share with those in need of comfort and hope.*I received an Advanced Reader's Copy of God In the Dark: 31 Devotions to Let the Light Back In from the publisher.

I know we are never alone, God is always there with us, but we go through times that can make us feel He is far away. Sarah's words and encouragement brought me to a place where I could see His light again, feel His presence, and take refuge in my Savior. This book is a great companion during dark times, full of support and always directing to God and His saving light."}, {"userName": "Leigh Thomas", "userReviewDate": "Apr 03, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54407404-leigh-thomas", "userReview": "Light.
