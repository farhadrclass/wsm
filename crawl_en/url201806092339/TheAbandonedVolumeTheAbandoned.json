That, and I had really been meaning to read something by Campbell for a while now. That said, I have to admit that the plot definitely felt a little less then original or explained. Maybe it would have felt fresher if I had read it ten years ago when it was published, but a lot of stuff is just glossed over or completely ignored. The zombies are there as a sort of \"be careful what you wish for\" back drop while all the real focus is on the characters.Because while it did feel a bit unbalanced at times, the characters really are worth the read. They're real people - strong and sassy to a fault - even if they aren't always the smartest people or the people best suited to survive a zombie apocalypse. This book is totally brutal, and sometimes you just have to wonder why you put yourself through it all. I believe it's just a stand alone (despite what goodreads says about it being a volume 1) but I felt like it had punched me in the gut by the time I got to the end.As far as the art goes, I really appreciated how confident everyone was in their sexuality. Despite the fact that most of the characters tend not to wear very much, it's obviously something they are fully OK with and they don't get into any \"fuck me now\" poses. It was also pretty cool that all the girls were different shapes and sizes and there were quite a few people of color.So if you want to see a super scientific explanation of zombies with almost super human zombie slayers this is not your book. But if you want to see a gang of sexy punk kids trying to survive as best they can against insurmountable odds you should definitely pick this up."}, {"userName": "Anina", "userReviewDate": "Oct 11, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/577976-anina", "userReview": "I really enjoyed this. Besides for having excellent illustrations, and a completely decent plot line for another zombie story, it tells a sad and beautiful story of young love. Young, lesbian, interracial love.

Look! It\u2019s a zombie comic set/around a majority-black population that has a lot of black characters (*cough*unlikeTWDespeciallytheTVseries*cough*). Snottiness aside, I\u2019m totally biased for this comic because the lead character (Rylie) is a hot, fat, pierced and tattooed, black lesbian punk with an awesome mohawk who volunteers at a nursing home and kills zombies with a toilet plunger. What\u2019s not to love? Seriously, this girl is making me think (1) I do, in fact, need bat wings tattooed on me and (2) oh lordy, how I wish she was real\u2026Anyhow, the comic follows a small group of friends who are punks and queers (many are orphans or abandoned by their parents- and now we have the title!) the day the zombie apocalypse starts in their small town, and the following week\u2019s aftermath. There\u2019s tons of blood, guts, zombie gore, and sexual frustration. I love the background details, it\u2019s filled with punk and horror movie references. For goodness\u2019 sakes, the only black male in the group is named Ben! According to Ross Campbell\u2019s website, there were suppose to be 3 books, but TOKYOPOP pulled the plug and only released one. Which is a damn shame. The ending made so much sense after I read that, but I think the ending works fine as is, also. (it also explains why I paid such a ridiculous amount of money for the trade paperback on amazon) The inking is gorgeous, black and white with reds and pinks highlighted. \u2014-spoilers\u2014-After killing off all but two of the characters we were introduced to in the first book (and after Rylie abandons Mae), I really wonder where Campbell would have gone with the story. Especially as the plot was supposed to have been that the infected are everyone over 23 years of age (along with the younger victims who are only bit, not killed, by the zombies). Apparently this was supposed to be a comment on our society\u2019s obsession with youth, which probably would have been expanded upon in future releases. I absolutely adore and appreciate that the none of the characters had a \u201ccoming out\u201d moment or any discussed backlash about being queer (besides a mention of Ben\u2019s dad not being OK with him- probably because he\u2019s gay, we\u2019re led to believe, but not told), despite being a teen-angst-fueled vehicle.\u2014-end of spoilers\u2014-Even with an ending that will leave you sadly unfulfilled, as we may never get any of the planned sequels, I\u2019d completely recommend this book for any zombie lover, especially anyone who is frustrated with the lack of queer, folks of color, and empowered women in comics. And especially fellow punks. Without more plot, I really can\u2019t say this is an absolute crowd pleaser- it merely skims what some popular zombie vehicles use to their advantage (humor, sex and violence, emotional depth, beloved characters, etc.)- but I think it will hold a beloved spot in quite a few people\u2019s bookshelves who can manage to get their hands on it.(Review cross-posted from \"You Die First!\" blog: http://fuckoffyoudiefirst.tumblr.com/...)"}, {"userName": "R.

This Publisher's weekly and the cover struck a harmonic chord, in some sort of pathetic, morbid way:From Publishers WeeklyCampbell (Wet Moon) adds color\u2014in this case red\u2014to the OEL manga format, the better to highlight zombie gore. Actually, the red keeps the reader's eye on Rylie, a red-headed black lesbian in a swampy Southern town. She's trying to start a relationship with her crush, Naomi, while the world ends around them. Campbell beautifully captures the decaying grandeur of the South, with the palpable weight of its languid air. Wearing little clothing isn't sexual; it's survival in the heat. His characters are solidly fleshy, realistic and with presence. There's a thin line between sex and death, and the characters deal with both in nonsentimental, practical ways as they talk about life and what they want to become and finding someone to love. The questions any teen faces, like whether or not to leave town when you're older or whether your friends will still be your friends as you grow up, become more powerful through the zombie symbolism. When a loved one turns 23, he becomes one of the monsters, and here the adults literally eat their young. This unique blend of zombie horror, relationship drama and Southern gothic says much about love and survival."}, {"userName": "Mel", "userReviewDate": "Mar 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5866692-mel", "userReview": "I'm a huge fan of Ross Campbell's Wet Moon series. I think it's one of the top five comic book series ever! The abandoned is a zombie comic he did while writing some of the early books of Wet moon. In a recent interview I read with him he said that he was trying to get across the idea of the fetishisation of youth in today's society but he thought he'd failed and just produced a mediocure zombie comic. I have to say that I thought it was very good. What made this different from most zombie films/books etc was that here I actually really liked the characters and so felt sad when they were eaten. I really wanted them to survive. The main character was a black lesbian with a red mohawk who volunteered at an old people's home and helped out with her friend's ice-cream shop. What was nice about the story was there were already established characters and relationships. There was a sense of reality to it that got violated in horrible ways. The zombie attacks and the fight scenes were quite gruesome. For some reason it's almost more disturbing to see it in comics than it is on film. Unlike Wet Moon the pacing was very fast with lots of attacks and action but there were still nice scenes with the characters so that the violence became more disturbing. I really enjoyed this one and would definitely recommend it."}, {"userName": "Angela", "userReviewDate": "Dec 26, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1135822-angela", "userReview": "Ok, I'll admit it. I'm a sucker for a zombie movie/book. Being as I'm also a sucker for Ross Campbell books, I melted when I heard about this one. Loved it. I near died when I found out that it wasn't going to be picked up for a sequel! You really can't go wrong with teens and end of the world kind of situations. Teens are so extreme even in normal situations. This worked very well, and I may read it again if I don't get a new novel soon.  Oh, but I did have one beef. This isn't Ross' fault, but the text and everything is really small becaues it's with Tokyopop instead of in a bigger format like Wet Moon. The images kinda suffer because it's cramped and some of the top and bottom, I think are cut off a little."}, {"userName": "Sean", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3056111-sean", "userReview": "Is it possible for a hurricane to somehow cause people over the age of 23 to turn into zombies? In Campbell's \"The Abandoned\" it is! Rylie lives in Georgia and finds in the blink of an eye that every adult around her suddenly dies...and comes back to life. Gathering a group of friends they do their best to protect themselves and find away to escape the mass of horror surrounding them.I loved the illustrations, especially the gray tones and red being the only true color showing through. Very artistic. Lots of lgbtq characters, and the topic of being gay isn't brought up once (score), and realistic relationship drama.

The muted colors and zombies were something that doesn't usually attract me to a book. But, I was pleasantly surprised. Everything about this manga just works. I love how it captured the way that Southern people actually talk. Sadly, that led to alot of misspellings, but it needed to be that way. I also loved how it presented yuri and yaoi relationships.
