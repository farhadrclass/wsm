I was so desperate to find hidden meaning in it, but there was nothing. Why waste so much paper and ink on something so overtly pretentious and so utterly meaningless? A group of oppressed sisters kill themselves after flirting with the neighborhood boys. How horrible that it happened in the middle of suburban America, where white picket fences are supposed to render such neighborhoods impermeable to tragic teenage death. In the end, all I got from this book was the fact that the girls were peculiar (and hello! at least one was not a virgin when she committed suicide), the boys were immature, the girls' parents were psychotic. Okay, sure, I get that there may have been metaphors and themes about the hypocrisy of middle America, oppressive religion, etc. etc., but I wasn't impressed. I saw Sofia Coppola's film afterward; no, it did not improve my understanding or appreciation of the film.I had read Middlesex by Eugenides and thought he was a genius. This book proved he is only an occasional genius.

It is such an unusual story - good, but dark and full of nooks and crannies for skeletons and other vermin to hide. It is hard to say I enjoyed a story like this - that would be like saying I enjoyed a car wreck; intriguing, but lots of people and property were damaged in the process.One main thing I can say is I don't think I have seen the main story take as much of a back seat to the setting, the symbolism, and the side characters. The book is \"The Virgin Suicides\", but they might be the least important, as well as the most important, part of the book. Are you confused yet?Setting: The neighborhood, the houses, the tree house, the school. Description of buildings. The importance of a location. Certain windows serving as stages into the performance of people's lives. All very complex and interesting.Coated in muck: Throughout the book things are covered in dust, slime, dead bugs, etc. Everything is made to seem like it is coated, and a deeper truth is underneath. And, I think it is important that the \"coating\" is never pretty. Things aren't coated in sugar, or clouds, or pretty makeup. It is always foul, stinking, decaying, etc.Symbolism - As the story deteriorates, so do the structures and the people. Buildings decay. People become more and more unstable. Every element spirals into a gloomy miasma and it moves towards the ultimate sad climax.The boys - the boys in the story serving as narrators really kept making me think of Stand By Me or The Sandlot. Coming of age. Looking into other people's lives. Trying to figure things out while wrapped in the innocence of youth. It was a very intriguing approach to telling the story.I think that many will enjoy this. Just remember that it is dark and somewhat disturbing. Not something to read while looking for a pick me up!"}, {"userName": "Sara Cantador", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11328330-sara-cantador", "userReview": "5/5Ten\u00eda ganas de dejar un poco de lado la literatura juvenil, as\u00ed que decid\u00ed coger esta novela que llevaba un tiempo llam\u00e1ndome desde mis estanter\u00edas. Qu\u00e9 sorpresa que se haya convertido en uno de los mejores libros que he le\u00eddo, pero pocos tienen la magia de la que bien puede alardear esta novela. Si tuviera que describir Las v\u00edrgenes suicidas con una palabra, \u00e9sa ser\u00eda sin duda \"intensa\". No s\u00e9 si fue cosa de la narraci\u00f3n, o la necesidad de conocer qu\u00e9 desencaden\u00f3 la secuencia de suicidios de las hermanas Lisbon, y que adem\u00e1s, a pesar de conocer el desenlace de antemano, lograra mantenerme en vilo en todo momento. Viviendo las vidas de este grupo de hermanas a trav\u00e9s de diferentes pares de ojos, que terminan formando un caleidoscopio de las mismas. Un caleidoscopio adem\u00e1s, gracias al cual acab\u00e9 pensando que Bonnie, Therese, Mary, Lux y Cecilia eran reales, que las conoc\u00eda de verdad y al mismo tiempo apenas sab\u00eda nada de ellas en absoluto. Como si s\u00f3lo se narrara lo equivalente a la punta del iceberg, con un fondo tan profundo que se requerir\u00edan p\u00e1ginas y p\u00e1ginas para conocerlas realmente. Y es que as\u00ed somos todos en realidad, \u00bfno?Me ha parecido desgarradora la forma de tratar el tema del control y la opresi\u00f3n familiares. De c\u00f3mo los padres de estas j\u00f3venes, que con toda la buena intenci\u00f3n quieren llevarlas por \"el buen camino\", terminan vetando su felicidad y desarrollo como personas. Sin duda, es una obra maravillosa, profunda y muy cuidada, que si bien puede resultar algo confusa al principio (es dif\u00edcil distinguir la l\u00ednea que separa el pasado con los pensamientos del narrador, o incluso lo que se desarrolla en el presente), termina creando una atm\u00f3sfera \u00fanica y absorbente. Se consigue una transici\u00f3n desde esa confusi\u00f3n inicial, hasta una novela compleja y con un entramado m\u00e1gico, que me atrap\u00f3 por completo y me dej\u00f3 sin palabras. Totalmente recomendado."}, {"userName": "K.D. Absolutely", "userReviewDate": "Mar 12, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2156200-k-d-absolutely", "userReview": "For me, what makes this novel different from those that I\u2019ve read so far is the narrator\u2019s voice: first person plural and the brilliant way Jeffrey Eugenides (born 1960) made use of it. Since the story is about 5 teenage sisters and the narrators were interested on them, readers presumed that they were narrating from the viewpoint of schoolboys with raging hormones and think of sex almost every hour of the day. Until the last sentence when Eugenides revealed that the narrators are already middle-age men with thinning hair and soft bellies. My perception of the story as a reader made a complete turnaround. Being a middle age man myself and having a teenager daughter, the last page upped the story\u2019s impact on me.The collective voice of the narrators who are voyeurs of the Lisbon family oozes with innocence (of being young and sexually curious) and guilt (of being voyeurs who did not do anything to save the sisters). If you read this novel in a superficial manner, this is just about 5 young sisters (13-year-old Cecilia, 14-year-old Lux, 15-year-old Bonnie, 16-year-old Mary, and 17-year-old Therese) who killed themselves because of their very strict mother and workaholic submissive effeminate father. They probably lost all hopes of having a good future like finishing school after they were pulled out just because Lux missed the curfew or finding a rich man to marry since they were not allowed to go out anymore. But Eugenides, having an M.A. in Creative Writing from Stanford University, knew better. It would have been too simple for a story to be all about that. In the narration, the boys said that the suicides were act of \u201cselfishness\u201d as the girls were at the brink of adulthood, pretty hence possible sexual preys. They fantasized about having sex with them and even kept with them the \u201cexhibits\u201d that even in their mid-lives still remind them of how they felt towards those pretty young things. The boys thought that they were innocent but the fact that they were watching the Lisbon house through their binoculars, they were communicating with them via songs played on the telephone, the girls were leaving notes posted on the bicycle wheels or in the mailboxes did not give them the inkling to help to prevent the eventual group suicides. They just watched and did nothing. In effect, the boys were the selfish ones and the guilt that permeates in them in their middle-age is what Eugenides, in my opinion, wants to communicate with this novel. Cecilia\u2019s suicide forewarned the narrators. Forewarned the people of small town of GrossPointe, Michigan. Some paid attention: the priest, the social worker. But in the end those were just not enough. The Lisbon sisters committed suicide with the blood left on the hands of the boys and the whole town.And the creepiest thing there is that since Eugenides used \"we\" and \"us\" and realizing in the end that those narrators were not teenage kids but were middle-age men, gave me the feeling that I, now a middle-age man myself, was with them watching Lux making out with faceless boys and men on the rooftop making me equally guilty. For me, this is a sample of a novel that seems to be a simple story but very rich in terms of interpretation. It just made me think of my role as a father to my teenage daughter. How I should deal with her especially during those times when we misunderstand each other, she locks herself in her room and cry. Fatherhood is trial and error and they say that one has to only follow his heart and everything will turn out right in the end. I wish it is that simple. Not that our family has the suicidal gene running in our blood but I just have to more sensitive and not bury myself in my office work and books and hope that times like that will go away once she's 20 and no longer an adolescent. Now I have enough motivation to read Eugenides\u2019 Pulitzer-winning novel Middlesex. One hell of a writer."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "Wow, you knew that this guy was the real deal after all.I see this as a perfect segue to his masterpiece \"Middlesex\". It's simple, it's sad, it is capital I Intriguing. The first novel always announces the author's intentions for those that come next, and Eugenides loves the themes of adolescence in all its tragic shortcomings. The Lisbon girls are monoliths to the nameless suitors who do nothing else but speculate about them and become passionate voyeurs. They do nothing to save them; they only observe and obsess. I guess while girls become emblematic of sexual repression, the foolish boys become symbols of generic apathy and cowardice. It's a symbol of the times; a portrait of suburban un-happiness."}, {"userName": "Julie", "userReviewDate": "Jun 05, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5211606-julie", "userReview": "Once, when I was 13, my father came home early from work and asked to see my yearbook. It was the last day of junior high, and I remember that I leaned against the kitchen counter, cracking my knuckles, and watched as he slowly turned the glossy pages, reading all of the comments that had been written by my friends. He was silent the entire time he was reading, but when he finished, he handed me back my yearbook and said, \u201cI loved being a teenager, but I wouldn't be one now for anything in the world.\u201dI thought I was going to receive a lecture that evening, but I didn't. To this day, I have wondered what spurred on his sudden interest in my social life and my friends. Had he read an article about the rise of teen suicide? My father had been a teenager in the late 1950s; his kids became teenagers in the 1980s. I can only imagine it was a very different experience for him.He was born 20 years before the author of this book, Jeffrey Eugenides, but they both grew up in the U.S., in the Midwest, and both of them experienced childhoods that were heavily influenced by the auto industry.They also both watched a lot of changes occur in the U.S., not the least of these being the confusing shifts in the lives of American adolescents.And I wish, wish, WISH that my father had discovered Mr. Eugenides and this UNBELIEVABLE, FANTASTIC, INCREDIBLY ORIGINAL debut novel before he passed, because he'd have been shaking his head in a stunned disbelief.Dad never knew Mr. Eugenides, but I do, and his Pulitzer-Prize winning Middlesex just about knocked me out. He's one hell of a writer, and he seems to capture the decline of American society without judgement, rant or sociological nudge.He's a storyteller who tells his tales, these deceptively simple stories that make you stop whatever you're doing, curl your toes, bite your nails, giggle into your hands or shout. . . HOW IS THIS YOUR DEBUT?! HOW IS THIS YOUR DEBUT, MR. EUGENIDES??!! NO, SERIOUSLY, HOW IS THIS YOUR DEBUT?And then he makes you cover your eyes with a cold compress and weep quietly into your pillow. . . I don't hate you, Mr. Eugenides. I'm sorry. I'm so, so sorry. I don't hate you, Jeffrey. In fact, I love you. Oh, I love you, Jeffrey. Oh, Jeffrey, I love you. . . as your family looks on in horror.People, I could write essay after essay about this book. I could stick quote after quote of brilliant prose on here. . . but all I want to do is tell you that after I finished it this evening, I could only curl up in a tight ball of jealousy and awe and suck my thumb."}, {"userName": "F", "userReviewDate": "Nov 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8161922-f", "userReview": "So disappointed with this book.I do not understand why it is raved about so much I thought it was so shit.

I have read some of the reviews of others who did not care for or get this book. I admit that the plot/storyline, though unique, is not what makes this story great--it's the prose. The writing is luminous and reads more like poetry than a novel. We don't even know exactly who the narrators are--it is narrated in first person plural and the name and even number of narrators is left vague. Eugenides uses metaphor to describe the deaths of the sisters as the disintegration of a suburban neighborhood--the trees are being cut down because of the threat of Dutch Elm disease; there are dying flies everywhere that are described by the first sister to commit suicide as not even having time to eat before their lives are over. There are so many themes in the story--going through the layers is akin to peeling an onion. The writing is so lovely that it induces a dreamlike state in the reader. Everything is described so perfectly that you can not only see clearly what is being described, but smell the various smells and recall with clarity everything from that time period. Eugenides did not throw this book together; in my mind's eye I see him sitting at his desk turning each phrase over and over in his hands until he gets it exactly right. Yet, the writing is not strained at all--in fact, it seems to have flowed effortlessly from his pen. This is a gifted writer whose work will be read for generations to come, long after Eat, Pray, Gag is in the remainder pile. Elizabeth Gilbert, Chris Bohjalian, Jodi Picoult, Robert James Waller, John Grisham, read this and weep. To this list I add myself, since I would give anything to be able to write half as well as Eugenides. As for those who look for a conventional plot line like all of the other books out there and do not find it (why EXACTLY did the girls kill themselves?) In the real world, not everything in life can be explained.I loved the book so much that I immediately rented the movie. It was awful, with the exception of James Wood who nailed the part of the father beautifully."}, {"userName": "Blair", "userReviewDate": "Apr 19, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/272909-blair", "userReview": "Honestly, I really wanted to fall in love with this. I've long been aware of its status as a cult classic and many people I know, as well as people I don't know but whose taste seems to correspond closely with mine, have professed to adore it. So I feel a bit uncomfortable about revealing that I disliked it - I'll admit, I have been guilty of judging people a bit if I see they've slated a book I really love, and this seems to be a book that has a lot of meaning for many readers - but, there you go, I can't help it.I DO 'get' a lot of the things people love about the story - the hazy, filmic quality of the writing, the sense of indefinable loss and nostalgia for childhood, the effective use of first-person-plural narrative, the clever structure with the obsessive boys cataloguing every shred of information they can find about the Lisbon girls and collating it into a sort of testament. But I didn't get much enjoyment from reading it. The tone reminded me a lot - A LOT - of The Lovely Bones, which I also disliked, and I presume this book must have been a major infuence on Alice Sebold's style. Some of the descriptive language seemed identical(ly ridiculous), for example the inventory of items thrown out from the Lisbons' house including 'blankets sopped with the picnic of the girls' spilled sleep' - what?! I felt repulsed by a lot of it - the descriptions, the characters - and the general queasy atmosphere made me feel quite ill. I know this is probably a part of what some appreciate, but I couldn't get into it at all. With the narrators seeming so odd, and the Lisbon sisters so distanced from them through the way they are idolised and analysed, I didn't feel a connection with anyone or anything in the story.Thinking about it, this also might be because the characters' everyday experiences were so completely removed from anything I remember about being a teenager, so I didn't find any of it to be something I could relate to either. I know you're not supposed to understand why the Lisbons killed themselves, but as someone who was severely depressed and at times suicidal at that age myself, it all rang so hollow to me and I couldn't shake the feeling that the book itself (as opposed to just the narrators) was romanticising suicide. This is particularly evident in a passage towards the end, discussing the girls attending a debutante party after the suicides: 'they were bound for college, husbands, child-rearing, unhappiness only dimly perceived - bound, in other words, for life.' So the Lisbons got the better end of the deal, I suppose, by escaping from this predestined boredom and misery early? I also couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to accept that ALL THESE MEN would remain so obsessed with the Lisbon girls for the rest of their lives - the bits about always thinking of Lux during sex, etc. Yes, it's believable that being a witness to the suicides of five young sisters would haunt them for a long time, but surely by middle age at least some of them would have moved past it? Surely they wouldn't still be continually fantasising about the early fumblings of a 14-year-old as grown men?! And if any of this is supposed to be at all romantic, I just found it downright weird. By the end I was so, so sick of their tedious obsession.Not for me."}, {"userName": "Maxwell", "userReviewDate": "Feb 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1381728-maxwell", "userReview": "I couldn't put this book down. It's not very long, and I'd been meaning to read it for years after hearing some great things about it. So I managed to get through it in a couple flights I took this week. It's utterly captivating; Eugenides's use of the choral narrative voice was unlike anything I've read before and the descriptions and dreamy and compelling. It has its moments of melodrama but those are balanced by the utterly mundane aspects of these characters' lives too. I feel like I need to read it again to pick up on so many elements I may have overlooked or not fully appreciated the first time around.

I think maybe a few people are going to be disappointed that I didn't give this five stars, and I mean, I'm upset that it wasn't five stars either, but hear me out.The thing I liked the most about this book is the perspective. We're learning about 5 girls who commit suicide.. and we NEVER hear anything substantial from any of the sisters? It was genius. The way this book was written is brilliant. Honestly, every couple of pages I would think to myself \"When Jeffrey Eugenides thought to himself that he should write this from the outside view he had one of the best epiphanies ever. Ever.\" The second thing I liked was the realism. This book is just so true, so pure. It isn't false in anyway, it states it how it is: sad and depressing and demoralizing and harsh and upsetting. But true. Why didn't I love this book? I don't know. I honestly, I don't know. There was something missing. Maybe it was my disconnect from the story, maybe it was my lack of real care for any of the events or characters, or maybe it was the lack of plot. When I'm true to myself, I could act like this was the best book, I could write and essay about how life altering this book is, but it's a lie.

A suburban mythology. At first, I couldn't shake images from the film, which I thought might detract from really appreciating it as a novel, but in the end it didn't. I think that's because I realized Sofia Coppola had done a remarkable job adapting the text. I mean, holy shit, it's pretty much perfect. Such a moody novel with sparse dialogue, but what is there, is so right on (and often funny)... GUSHHHH.Something that I very much loved about the book (and that lacks from the film), are the moments when the boys realize not only that the Lisbon girls are unique entities, but that they're not perfect. One's even described as \"horsey\". I love that. I love it when people fall in love with real people. People with big foreheads, or big noses. People with crowded smiles.I love the narrator. Worringly obsessed (especially considering the time that's passed) though he may be, it really feels like someone is telling you something true. It's the kind of story you would tell for decades had you lived to see it, and I like to think it actually happened in a town not far from where I grew up, years before I was born, a story I'd hear from locals, never quite sure how much of it was true, and how much had become local legend."}, {"userName": "Josu Grilli", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4322616-josu-grilli", "userReview": "La verdad es que me he pensado darle esta nota.

I initially rated this book four stars but no, it deserves a five star rating . And where have I been since 1999? On some desert island? How did I not possibly know of this wonderful gem of a book? Mr Eugenides has shot onto my favourite author list and I've ordered Middlesex and The Marriage Plot from my bookseller.This is a haunting, dreamlike, atmospheric and raw novel. Told from the viewpoint of five men now in their thirties. They recount one year some twenty years earlier and the obsession they had with a family of girls; an obsession which haunts them even in their adult years. It begins with the suicide of the youngest girl; the precursor to the preoccupation the boys have with the Lisbon sisters. This is a tale of the atrophy of the Lisbon family; the gradual breakdown of their tenuous lives over the course of 13 months. And it's basically neighbourhood story; Michigan in the 1970's, one street, one year, five girls and the neighbouring boys. The story is told interestingly in plural first person narration by the boys. The sisters are a mystery to the boys then and still some twenty years later where the memory still haunts them. The girls actually remain a bit of a mystery to the reader partly because you never actually hear from their viewpoint. They appear wraith-like and mystical to both reader and narrators. Cecilia, Bonnie, Mary, Therese and Lux have lived cloistered lives. Although they attend the same school as the boys, they keep to themselves; appear unusual and different from the other pupils. The boys have almost a reverent need to know; it seems driven by a pure want to be close to the girls. They start collecting what will be an extensive cache of what they term as exhibits including Cecilia's journal, a faded polariod, Lux's bra and Bonnie's votive candles. Insights other than the boys' own are recounted as the narrators later seek out various neighbours, other pupils, parents and teachers. Although, as they discover, this knowledge will do little to uncover the riddle of the elusive Lisbon girls. The book is light on dialogue and rich with description; delicious detail, detail, detail.

Que cuando le\u00edas sus novelas te sent\u00edas parte de ellas, con una sensaci\u00f3n de empat\u00eda indirecta, fr\u00eda e inc\u00f3moda. Bueno, a todos los que me dieron eso, les digo que me sent\u00ed igual que ustedes, como todo un personaje m\u00e1s de la trama. Gracias por el dato, fellas.Lo m\u00e1s atractivo de la novela es la trama, el estilo y la narraci\u00f3n. No los personajes, no el entorno, no los acontecimientos posteriores, no. De hecho, de una u otra manera, te cuentan el final en la primera p\u00e1gina. Y me gusta, ya que el autor es valiente, se aventura y toma riesgos. Lo cual le hace el trabajo m\u00e1s dif\u00edcil, ya que mantener al lector enganchado es m\u00e1s complicado.C\u00f3mo la sinopsis refleja a la perfecci\u00f3n, \u201cLas v\u00edrgenes suicidas\u201d sigue la historia detr\u00e1s de la familia Lisbon. Conformada con los tir\u00e1nicos padres, Mr y Mrs Lisbon y las cinco hermanas. La novela comienza con la muerte (suicidio) de la \u00faltima hermana Lisbon, lo cual, a trav\u00e9s de un racconto, volvemos a la historia de la primera hermana Lisbon en cometer suicidio, \u00bfPor qu\u00e9 lo har\u00e1? Esa es la pregunta que el lector tiene a lo largo de la novela.Como hab\u00eda dicho anteriormente, el otro aspecto muy positivo de la novela fue la manera en que cre\u00f3 la narraci\u00f3n de la historia. Con una primera persona plural, no-omnisciente, digamos mejor, \u201ctestigo t\u00edmido\u201d, Eugenides te hace un narrador m\u00e1s de la historia, y eso, d\u00e9jenme decirles, est\u00e1 cool. Es interesante, porque el grupo de narradores son unos hombres que est\u00e1n recordando su adolescencia en donde conocieron (muy de cerca) a las hermanas Lisbon.Sin embargo, sent\u00ed que la novela del autor estadounidense tuvo un problema de conexi\u00f3n y de desarrollo de trama (que la trama general est\u00e1 buena, pero la mal desarroll\u00f3). Mal desarrollada porque al principio de la novela el ambiente es muy gris y opaco, con una intriga muy potente, la cual le da vida a la novela. Pero el final de la historia, adem\u00e1s de brusco y sin sentido, no sigui\u00f3 la l\u00ednea que Eugenides hab\u00eda trazado desde el principio y a lo largo de toda la novela. En conclusi\u00f3n, lo creado por Eugenides es una novela que se lee muy r\u00e1pido (un d\u00eda en mi caso), con una pluma incre\u00edblemente pulida y con un contenido val\u00f3rico muy potente. Refleja el tema de las apariencias, las cuales a veces nos pueden enga\u00f1ar dej\u00e1ndonos un sabor muy amargo en nuestra vida, habla tambi\u00e9n de la muerte, de las heridas (quiz\u00e1s cr\u00f3nicas) que deja, y como un conflicto familiar mal tratado, puede explotar de la peor forma posible. Una lectura amena e inquieta, la cual sin duda llamar\u00e1 tu atenci\u00f3n.

Jeffrey Eugenides has the unique ability to transform a very simple story into one of complete beauty. Suicide isn't the most pleasant of topics, especially when it's the suicide of five adolescents, but Eugenides writes it so well that it is impossible not to appreciate it. He blends just enough dark humor in to keep it tasteful and incorporates melancholy passages that completely numbed me. Almost every page of this book had a meaningful quote on it.I think this is mentioned in almost every review, but the first-person plural narration is done expertly. By using \"us\" and \"we,\" Eugenides drew me into the story and made me feel as if I was one of those neighborhood boys obsessing over the Lisbon girls.I don't really know what else to say about this since the real beauty of this story comes through when you're reading it.

It sounds utterly depressing and it is, but the way it's told it really captures the essence of adolescence yearnings, of unattainable fascinations of the elusive repressed sheltered Lisbon girls. The writing is as beautiful as the sisters, the story travels quickly almost without pause and you get really caught in this captivating story told in this most compelling way. I was completely swept away with this stunning story with it's beautiful sense of melancholia and despair. There is no happy ending but that pretty much sums up suicide. The fact that these girls were in the prime of their life in the midst of their burgeoning womanhood makes this book all the more poetic and unnerving."}, {"userName": "Flor", "userReviewDate": "Nov 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55277703-flor", "userReview": "Juro solemnemente no volver a leer nada m\u00e1s del autor.

I discovered it was first published in 1993 only after I had chosen it to be my eleventh classic of the year. I'd never considered before that one would've been published in my lifetime, but according to Goodreads, many other people have shelved it as 'classic' also. It also has that modern classic feel to it. It seems that everybody has read it or has heard of it yet it's not just popular, but acknowledged to be a literary gem. Regardless of whether it is or not, I felt that it was one of those novels that I must read. And so I did.As per usual, I did not read the blurb before starting the book and so I had assumed that it'd be about a suicide pact, perhaps one started by a group of friends at school. But it's actually about much more than the suicide, because you already know that it's going to happen and how, but not why. It centres around five sisters: the Lisbon girls \u2013 Therese (17), Mary (16), Bonnie (15), Lux (14) and Cecilia (13). It is narrated by the boys who doted on them, but twenty years later. They simply refer to themselves as 'we' and seemed to tell the story in a very emotionally detached way and so I couldn't quite work out who they were at first \u2013 they often refer to specific 'exhibits' such as photographs. Yet they also often slipped into dreamy reminiscence. The Virgin Suicides felt blissful in spite of the imminent tragedy. The boys knew the girls better than anyone, but also did not know them at all.I usually see storytelling as being more important than the writing, but in this case I couldn't separate the two \u2013 the writing is beautiful and the style feels essential to the story. I felt that The Virgin Suicides depicted heightened (and exaggerated) realism and it forces you to truly think about the Lisbon girls, not just as characters, but as real people with intentions. Although the reader is viewing them from the outside, it is still very much the girls' story \u2013 it's just that they are not the ones telling it.The Virgin Suicides is a poignant, contemplative and very American novel that takes us on a distorted flashback through adolescent heartache and emotional pain that can be difficult to grasp unless experienced. I'll definitely be watching the movie adaptation because I've heard that although it's very well done, it's very different. I'll also have to read Jeffrey Eugenides' other novels, Middlesex and The Marriage Plot.I also reviewed this book over on Pretty Books."}, {"userName": "Bonnie", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5136858-bonnie", "userReview": "\"With most people,\" he said, \"suicide is like Russian roulette.

On top of that, it\u2019s actually told as almost a recollection of people who were affected by these girls and their actions.

Because what the heck? I wanted to mix it up a bit. Because besides my tendency to zone out while listening, it's fun to listen to someone tell you a story isn't it?I was scanning the aisle of worn-out plastic boxes and found this stuffed between two other pop-pulp audiobooks and since most of the shelf was populated with pop-pulp I thought  i really should read this one. that eugenides, he's one of those i really should read. And you know what? I'm really glad I did. Because This one was interesting. Yes, interesting because I'm scraping the empty vaults of my vocabulary and coming back with nothing else. Eugenides tip-toes the line between realism and surrealism throughout this entire book. The first chapter is completely bizarre, and flavored by his somewhat ostentatious prose, it has both a religious and magical feel. Needless to say, it pulled me headlong into the rest of the book. In fact, I spent about the entirety of last night and the day today listening just to finish it!The surrealism kept me very intrigued, and to be honest, the book hits some speed bumps with the other more realistic sections. Eugenides really loves to write about specific details. Writing about specific details is very important to any work of fiction but it can be taken to an extreme. In the case of this book, it is taken to an extreme. Especially in some sections where he will just list off thousands of details about the houses or the Lisbon girls with long strings of adjectives. It frequently occurred to me:  what's the point? . Especially the end, which I was hoping to be done with much sooner than it did. Despite this tick of Euginides writing, I feel as though this book will stick with me for a while. There is a lot to chew on and it had me checking the dictionary on more than one occasion. That is a good thing! But I mean \"conflagration\"?!?!?! \"crepuscular\"?!?!? Thanks for making me feel stupid and ineloquent! Other than that I don't have anything too new or original to say about it. But if I can impart one thing; it is that it perfectly captures the myopic obsessions of male adolescent libido. He inhabits the mindset that I saw myself and my middle school friends enter so frequently in the cafeterias and in the confines of vapid gossip. The mindset of infatuated boys and the way it drives them to puzzle over the opposite sex and treat them as to-be-discovered riddles. I couldn't help but think of this brilliant  new Moonface song. I almost laughed a few times at how the girls are described by the creepy old men of the town. Each member of the community tries to take their best shot at \"figuring out\" these girls; the doctors poke and prod in their offices, the psychologists psycho-analyze and the housewives gossip. The Lisbon sisters become cyphers and enigmas under the harsh scrutiny of 60's paranoid suburbia. The book is told all through second-hand accounts. It functions as an investigation of sorts into their psyches. This all makes me think it could have a satirical slant, but I'm not quite sure.This all functions with a touch of Faulknerian-style writing and brilliant usage of first person plural. And when I say brilliant first-person plural, I mean it puts  this  to utter shame. It completely works for the book.

But Eugenides constructs the story so peculiarly that the conventional reaction you expect to have goes flying out the window. The content is depressing. Yet it\u2019s treated in a way that makes it seem surreal and magical, almost romantic, and even darkly funny at times.I\u2019m still not sure what I feel right now. I\u2019m sad, intrigued, a little frustrated, but accompanying everything is a weird sense of detachment and indifference. I feel like I must grieve for these poor girls and their tragically short lives, but I can\u2019t because I\u2019m not moved enough. And strangely, that\u2019s exactly what the book sets out to achieve. You are supposed to know about the girls but not get to know them. You are supposed to know what happened, but not why it happened.The story is narrated from the perspective of a bunch of boys who lived in the Lisbon\u2019s neighborhood at the time of the tragedy. Now in their mid-thirties, the boys are still haunted by the enigma of the girls\u2019 suicides. The tone, in many ways, is like a criminal investigation \u2013 the boys have collected a series of evidence and interviewed people (including the girls\u2019 parents) in a desperate attempt to understand what might have happened during those terrible thirteen months.This style of narration is what keeps you detached. The Lisbon girls are never really the protagonists, even though the book essentially tells their story \u2013 or at least, tries to. Their lives unfold like a patchwork of recollections and assumptions; a collage of many different, tiny details that when put together only forms a vague impression of five depressed sisters.More than the grief, this book stirred an intense curiosity in me. It\u2019s like I\u2019ve contracted the boys\u2019 collective obsession; like I\u2019ve myself lived across the Lisbons and seen them being consumed by rot and ruin. And just like every other person privy to the tragedy, I find myself making assumptions and theories about what the girls must have felt and thought during the last few months of their lives.Sad. Dreamlike. Weird. I really liked The Virgin Suicides. It's a great piece of literature and its status as a cult classic of sorts is justified.

It's such a powerful book full of grief and sorrow. It's incredible sad, mystical in ways, also with an interesting narrative. The five Lisbon daughters all commit suicide, and we follow some boys who live across the street that watch them and obsess with there lives. For the daughters, first we have Cecilia, who is the youngest child. She is 13 years old and the first to go, she is known as the odd sibling. Her suicide takes the town and her families lives for a huge turn. We also have Mary, Bonnie, Lux, and Therese. All of the daughters are and there teens and live with extremely strict parents. There very religious, not aloud to where clothes that show to much skin, not aloud to date, not aloud to go to parities or dances, and barley they are barley aloud to leave the house. Can you just imagine a strict home, and the youngest daughter kills themselves? Like all the repercussions this has on the family and the whole town. The boys who narrate give a very interesting insight. They tell us the story from the past about what went down with the Lisbons when they were teenagers. They had lived on the same street and obsessed over this family, more specially the daughters. They describe them and there personalities and all the odd things about this family. These guys are outsiders but manage to tell a raw story about these girls. I think the way Eugenides narrated this book was just so clever. Overall, this book is very heart braking. If your into conclusions were EVERYTHING is explained, that's not what your gonna get here. The second time around the story still took me for a wild ride and had my jaw dropping.

Everyone has their theories on it, their opinions and no matter how hard we may ever try we will NEVER truly understand the mindset of those who choose to take their own lives. The Virgin Suicides is NOT a novel about the \nact\n of suicide, in truth, it is a story about coping with suicide. Of attempting to comprehend the moments which led to the act and whether there was something, ANYTHING, that could have prevented it. What could possibly inspire five beautiful teenage girls to snuff out their short lives this way?!Told through the perspective of one of the neighborhood boys, this story takes place in \"the afterward\" and is a reflective exploration of the polaroid image moments glimpsed PRIOR to the act, and what they may or may not have meant to the girls...Of course, since it is not told from the Lisbon girls' point of view it is impossible to know what, if anything, these memories meant to them. Our narrator sets images and glimpses into their tragic lives without backstory or subtext and it's incomprehensible. In this way The Virgin Suicides reads very real to life. There are moments which, within context, are grotesque and horrifying simply because of their mundane nature. Boys will masturbate... fantasize about slim pale limbs and glossy blonde hair, this is a fact of life, but with cursory knowledge these acts seem more horrifying than their actuality.This is a bleak read, ladies and gents!! It's a raw, uncensored and unapologetic narration of the attempt to cope with that which is impossible. And that juvenile love, so huge because it never had to survive real life, is more unforgettable BECAUSE when someone dies in your height of love for them, unknown and anonymous but for mere glimpses, they remain forever perfectly perfect in your eyes.
