Imagine inviting all your zombie mates back? It just wouldn't work, would it?However, in the first Zombie tales outing the people in question aren't actually fully fledged zombies yet and it is just another ordinary day for the cursed agoraphobic landlord of Primrose Court Apartments as he spies on the neighbours, makes notes in his little journal (each neighbour has their own specific section), fastidiously cleans himself and prepares to meet his shrink in a Starbucks - his first venture into the outside world in ten years. Unfortunately for our narrator, the reason he doesn't step outside much is that he is some sort of human conduit for every sort of viral plague but rather than dying himself, his illnesses always (inexplicably) coincide with the gruesome accidental deaths of people nearby. The rationale behind this is never explained... indeed I am sure one would be hard pushed to put a medical definition on it, so for now lets just consider it a cruel act of fate. Suffice to say that so far he is has inadvertently killed most of his own family and by leaving his apartment to go to Starbucks, this man is about to jump start the zombie apocalypse.This is a weird story line and as illustrated above, you will need to find a tower crane in order to have somewhere suitable to suspend your disbelief but the writing was really good. Not random, not badly edited, not corny with actual words making sense and in quite an entertaining way which has convinced me to read the next instalment before the zombies nom nom nom on my brain."}, {"userName": "Not Now...Mommy's Reading", "userReviewDate": "Nov 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1185550-not-now-mommy-s-reading", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this short story set in the world of \"Don of the Dead\" created by author Robert DeCoteau.

Today is a first, as I am reviewing three books at one time! LOL! Zombie Tales: Primrose Court Series is a collection of three short stories by author Robert DeCoteau. All three stories were based on Decoteau\u2019s novel Don of the Living Dead. I have yet to read this novel, but I must say that I enjoyed all of the Primrose Court \u201cshorts!\u201dIn the first book, Primrose Court Apt. 205, we read about Theodore Granger \u2013 a man who suffers from Agoraphobia and OCD, has an irrational fear that he is cursed, and that his presence has caused many deaths. In the story, Theodore has decided he is going to take his first step out into the world after ten years of being a recluse. It is an important day for him! He only has to walk one block and cross the street to get to the coffee house where he is supposed to meet his doctor. Unfortunately, there are more deaths along the way.In the second book, Primrose Court Apt. 305, we read about Charles Grimly and his wife, Mariana. Charles definitely has a \u201cNorman Bates\u201d complex, as he, too, cannot let go of his mother\u2019s apron strings. His wife is a stripper at a local club and Charles has a problem with this. He is an over-weight guy who lives with a a woman who cannot stand the sight of him and treats him like dirt. As I read the story, I often wondered why Mariana married Charles if she despised him so. Everyone has a breaking point and Charles finally reaches his. With the help of his dead mother, it looks like Charles may be onto a better life \u2013 minus his pushy wife. However, even the best laid plans go awry. There are some things which cannot be foreseen \u2013 he is about to find that out.In the last book, Primrose Court Apt. 502, we learn Tommy\u2019s story. I actually felt sorry for this young man. He is a druggie who lives with his mother who suffers from Alzheimer\u2019s. He has just lost his job and learned that his girlfriend is sleeping with his drug dealer.

I am often displeased with short stories because there isn\u2019t enough time to get to know the characters and relate to them on a personal level.

I generally abhor short stories with a fiery, stinging passion and avoid them like I avoid that neighbor I can't stand who, when she stops to talk to you, you know you're in for AT LEAST an hour before you can claw your way away from her. For those who are unaware, the \"Zombie Tales\" books are side stories to the author's Don of the Living Dead, which I believe is a full novel. The concept of the \"Zombie Tales\" books, perspectives (in separate novellas) of different residents of an apartment building set in the Don world during an impending zombpocalypse was such a novel (heh, novel, I made a joke!) concept, that I overlooked my general dislike and decided to take a chance. Not only was this very well written (some minor editing complaints, though), but it was surprisingly well done in so few pages. Robert DeCoteau has written Theodore Granger very well as a paranoid, whiny, complainy, germophobic agoraphobe who has not been outside in ten years, honestly for understandable reasons.So, of course, he WOULD pick the onset of a zombie apocalypse as his first venture out in ten years..."}, {"userName": "Karen", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15411105-karen", "userReview": "This is one of three short stories set in the Primrose Court apartment complex.

I thought the idea of this story was very intriguing in the fact that the author picks one individual to follow around and in just a few pages we are introduce to who they are as a person and a quick but revealing back story. Although this is a zombie story there really isn't any zombie type action until close to the end. This is really more like \"Where were you when the Zombie Apocalypse happened?\" and then the story is over.I think this author has a lot of potential and I did go and get a copy of the novel these stories are based on. There is also 2 or 3 chapters of \"Don\" at the end of this story to get you hooked (which I was). The descriptions of the characters, their surroundings, and the so-called meaningless activities they are engaged in are realistic and full, while not being overly wordy, and give depth and dimension to the story.So why only 3.5 stars? There were some pretty significant spelling and grammar errors throughout. There weren't a ridiculous amount of individual errors but the errors that did occur were glaring (at least in my opinion). I would've enjoyed this story more if a closer eye had been paid to editing process. Also, I was not aware that only half of the length of the book on my Kindle device was this story. The other half were the first chapters of the book \"Don of the Living Dead\". I didn't mind that this was included because it did get me interested in the book, however, I already would've been prone to buy the book without the chapters included in the story. I've also actually read the other two short spin off stories and they all contain the same beginning of \"Don\". The description for this product already states it's based on the \"Don\" book so it really wasn't necessary to include it at all. It was a little off putting when you reach the 50% mark and the story is actually over.As stated above, I do think this author has a lot of potential. Especially because I've read the other Primrose stories, which are all worth it and I enjoyed all of them. I just hope when I finally read the actual book there aren't the grammar and spelling errors."}, {"userName": "Doug", "userReviewDate": "Sep 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9522464-doug", "userReview": "This is one of a set of three short stories (also Zombie Tales Primrose Court Apt. 305 and Zombie Tales Primrose Court Apt. 502) written about the same series of events, through the eyes of the residents of three apartments in the same complex.

The first three chapters of the book are previewed at the end of each of the short stories, though I'm going to wait to read because I have a feeling I'm going to want the entire book at hand when I start.One thing I'll say about the series so far is the author does an amazing job at introducing his characters so the reader is able to get a good picture of each of them in such a short section of reading, and leave the reader wanting to know more.This story, my second favorite of the three, tells the story of a young man who is a bit of a punk rocker and a stoner.

Theodore Granger lives in Apartment 205, he owns Primrose Court and is agoraphobic (a fear of public places) and today is the first time in ten years that he is leaving his apartment to meet his therapist, Theodore wants to go out, he knows he has to but due to a never~ending bad luck streak, Theodore believes he is cursed, bad things happen around him and lives are lost, and Theodore becomes ill. As Theodore waits to face the world, his neighbours are annoying him as usual (his neighbours incessant arguing and the strange teenager who lives above them) but what he and his neighbours do not realise, is that the world is changing outside for everyone.Theodore Granger has to be the most unluckiest person in the world and I understood completely why he could not face going outside. Despite the fact its a short story, Robert DeCoteau successfully highlights Theodore agoraphobia in a real and sympathetic way which made for interesting reading. By the end of the story, you will wish along with Theodore that he really should have stayed at home.

Theodore Granger is afraid to leave his apartment. He thinks he's cursed and if he gets sick, people die. Could he be the reason for the zombie apocalypse? DeCoteau never really states as much, but I couldn't help to wonder. I've often wondered what leads a person to become agoraphobic. Reading Theodore's back story, I wouldn't want to leave my apartment either. Especially if I had a hearty supply of these stories.Looks like I'll have to buy Don of the Dead to get more of DeCoteau's zombie writing because when I was finished reading these books, I really just wanted more.Of the three, this one had the most grammatical/spelling errors.
