I've tried out a few of his other works (e.g., Time Storm, The Dragon and the George), but been less impressed. I'm sorry to say that Wolf and Iron fits in that latter category.The prose is smooth, the characters engaging. Dickson has obviously done his research, as attested to in a foreword by the wolf expert he consulted. Unfortunately, it doesn't come across well. The novel was written well before Wikipedia existed, but Wolf and Iron feels like nothing so much as a thorough regurgitation of Wikipedia pages. Protagonist Jeebee Walther is chock full of clever ideas and practical tips that he picked up and remembered through thorough reading, and for every situation he encounters, he remembers one easily and accurately.Part of the book's problem is that there's never really much tension. Jeebee starts off well-stocked with gadgets, and rapidly loses almost all. In fact, he's so certain to lose them that Dickson almost forgets to tell us. For example, he starts with a high-tech water filter - surely a crucial item that he would rely on daily. Yet at one point, Jeebee, in need of water, suddenly remembers that he lost this vital item some time back. Dickson also loses track of the story in other ways, inadvertently suggesting some incredible coincidences that are probably just editorial errors. Jeebee's carelessness doesn't matter, because we always know that this bookish city boy will overcome any obstacle. This despite the fact that he is evidently less prepared for survival than every other person he encounters. The stock ultra-competent young woman he meets loves him despite his at best anachronistic \u201chold her close until she stops fighting love\u201d approach to courtship. Dickson throws in some hand-waving to create some relationship-building time, but it isn't really credible.The problem is that Dickson becomes so enamored of the practicalities of survival that it becomes the core of the story, and he throws in ever trick he can think of. The book is essentially a rewrite of Robinson Crusoe in Montana, complete with makeshift fortress and source of bounty - except that in Jeebee's case, that's not a ship, but a nearby ranch, and Friday is a wolf. The ranch is where the book loses its storyline most thoroughly. Rather than move into the handy abandoned ranch, Jeebee spends chapters dragging material to a more rustic cave, and doesn't even do it efficiently. While it's meant as a temporary shelter for one winter, he immediately plans to establish a smithy. While he's nominally trying to stay silent and inconspicuous to the neighbours who are certain to come, whenever he's not dragging material back and forth, he's out shooting cattle. Even the man-wolf relationship, otherwise the saving grace of the book, is secondary to description of day-to-day chores (though Dickson is much more shy of body parts). Much of the space it does take is either Jeebee worrying about what Wolf's actions mean \u2013 until Wolf isn't quite as useful anymore \u2013 or protecting his belonging's from Wolf's apparently insane curiosity. For example, he sleeps on top of a metal ladder, because otherwise, Wolf would apparently eat it for dinner.The book is mildly interesting because it is well-researched, but there's not much here that Daniel Defoe didn't already cover in a different setting..* A note on the Start Science Fiction e-book edition \u2013 it's evidently OCR based, with less than perfect proofreading. There are a fair number of typos, and one spot in which an editorial note has been left [bracketed] in the middle of the text to clarify one obvious and easily fixed original typo. It's less than impressive for a book that's not that old."}, {"userName": "Fiver", "userReviewDate": "May 29, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2770395-fiver", "userReview": "I only know one stanza of T.S. Eliot's poetry, and the most popular one at that: \"This is the way the world ends, not with a bang, but a whimper.\" Of all the apocalyptic scenarios that I've read about, the one invoked by this line seems to me to simultaneously be the most likely, the most interesting, and the most overlooked. The world won't tumble into anarchy and decay from a comet, or from nuclear war, or a supervirus, or overpopulation. Instead, it will slowly sink into a bog of smaller social problems, letting the human race loose it's infrastructure piece by piece rather than all at once.\"Wolf and Iron\" intrigued me because it is based in just such a scenario. The setup is familiar to fans of PA: the end of the world has come and gone, and now America is a land without electricity, gasoline, or communication. Through this world, our main character Jeebee travels with his aquired pet wolf, Wolf (simple names for simple times, I guess). Together, the unlikely pair learn to redefine their relationship towards each other and toward other humans as they trek across the midwest United States.Dickson does a good job of walking through the nitty-gritty details of survival, but very quickly the book becomes too focused on these points without evidently trying to use them for any higher purpose. Chapter after chapter slowly detail each step that Jeebee takes in his journey, but at almost no point is there a sense of progression or purpose... that is, until the unfortunate end of the book. Here, the timescale of the plot is blown out of proportion. Where the first four hundred pages of the book cover a timescale of perhaps four months, the next thirty cover six, and the final thirty cover an entire year. It is here that Wolf and Iron hurredly throws in some potentially interesting plot developments, and even has some wonderful closing scenes, but they are far too rushed to be enjoyed. If the entire novel had focused on these parts, I might have enjoyed it more.Altogether, it's a book that needs a rewrite. Post-apocalyptic landscapes are constantly in danger of being boring, since there's a strong emphasis on solitude and dehumanization, but I wouldn't expect an author like Gordon Dickson to hit such an obvious pothole. Some parts of the book need to be cut out and some need to be expanded, and while I wait for that rewrite to occur, I'm sure there are more interesting PA books to read."}, {"userName": "Elle", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5634880-elle", "userReview": "This is a rather strange book. The original barely logical plot of traveling to some long-lost brother's ranch is quickly abandoned in favor of survival porn: endless descriptions of scavenging and rigging weapons and shelter. Normally, that'd be pretty tense and interesting, but the main character stumbles across the post-apocalyptic equivalent of Home Depot in an abandoned ranch that provides him with all the supplies he could need for the last third or so of the book, so it's more like reading some prepper's blog about a weekend out in a nature preserve.For how much research Dickson put into this novel, it's strange how often the little details seemed to escape him. Jeebee starts the novel stocked with a handful of futuristic survival devices that simply vanish from the narrative with no more than a passing thought of, \"Oh, I can't find it.\" In the middle of the novel, he's gifted a giant sword-like Bowie knife and even given knife fighting lessons. The other character warns Jeebee to never get into close combat unless he absolutely must, and that he should never use this megasword for chopping wood or other mundane things, only to kill. Oh man, I thought, surely this was going to pay off in some epic life-or-death scene where Jeebee has to machete chop somebody to death. Sweet! Nah. The knife gets strapped to his boot and is never mentioned again.So, for how heavily the book relies on the relationship between Jeebee and Wolf for its interest, tension, and progress, very little is done with it. I started the book thinking it would be something more along the lines of \"A Boy and His Dog\" and was pleasantly surprised to find it was a more realistic depiction, but I still feel like the interactions between human and wolf suffer from the same pitfalls as the survival writing: bland lists of researched details couched in the thinnest plot.As a rather silly aside: This is probably the first book to make me exclaim \"move on already\" aloud while reading it. Strangely enough, it wasn't the scene where the main character eats wolf vomit that did it, but the birthing scene. Granted, I have a strange phobia/hatred of anything pregnancy related, but the details Dickson selected for his otherwise rather sparse descriptions were rough to get through."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Apr 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/800291-andrew", "userReview": "I really did enjoy this book - even though I am on to my second copy of it. The first was ruined when there was a huge section missed from the printing - I would say that over a chapter was gone.The book really is your standard journey of redemption which the world falls apart and reverts back to a most simplistic and as you would expect barbaric age. The real star of the book though is the wolf. I will admit apart from finding the animal majestic and terrifying I grew up with dogs - big dogs and have their companionship and loyalty has always impressed me (and amazed me when you look at the cruelty the suffer at our hands too). So when the two team up to continue their journey and adventures I think you see the start of amazing team all the way up to the final confrontation. To me Gordon Dickson is the creator of the Dorsai series, one of the pillars of the science fiction genre - however he has written many books over a very long career and this book is a perfect example which to me reminds me that every once in a while I need to look past the famous names and titles and look at little closer at what else they have done."}, {"userName": "Jeff Miller", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3947630-jeff-miller", "userReview": "I have always enjoyed Dickson, but found this one to be exceptional. post-apocalyptic, but concentrating mostly on the story of one man. An academic who understood a bit about what was coming, but still was not prepared. The story of him and the wolf he befriends was quite enjoyable along with the little contact he has with others as he tried to travel to his brother's farm. The foreword from an expert on wolf behavior tells of his time working with Dickson to help him to get the wolf-behavior details right. This really adds to the story which seems so true-to-life in a way most post-apocalyptic isn't. Maybe because it concentrates more on relationships than the catastrophe."}, {"userName": "Derek", "userReviewDate": "Aug 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5420722-derek", "userReview": "Post-apocalyptic, Man & Dog (well, wolf), Gordie Dickson: what's not to love!It's years since I read this, but it had a profound effect on me, and I really want to find a copy.***Edit: I got hold of a copy.I'm fascinated by the depth of research that went into the Man/Wolf relationship (somewhat forced on him by his wolf researcher, Dr. Harry Frank, who wouldn't let him get away with anything!) but perplexed how at times he gets even the simplest things wrong. For the second time in a week (the first author who did it was forgettable and forgotten), I read how it was important to stay \"upwind\" of a predator so that it couldn't smell you. No, you stay \"downwind\": just as water flows from \"upstream\" to \"downstream\", air flows from \"upwind\". And speaking of \"upstream\", when Jeebee follows a stream uphill, and finds himself at a branch where two streams flow downhill, how can he possibly even have to investigate to know that one of those streams is man-made? Honestly, Gordie, it can't happen in nature.That said, I loved the book when I first read it, and I still do on re-reading.

Dickson fan for decades, since the late 1960s. This book caught my attention because of the subject matter - Wolf behavior and how it would tie in to a very human survival story after the crash of civilization. In fact, the only thing that got glossed over during the course of the story was the crash itself. Sure, it was mentioned and even discussed but I'm not sure I caught onto the actual causes. But that's no problem because really it's more like background for the rest of the book. Jeebee is sort of an unlikely hero. A former academic who had predicted the crash and still almost gotten killed by former neighbors when things got bad. He moves out, on his own, to try to locate an older brother living in Montana. Along the way he learns quite a bit, most of which is discussed in great detail. He also ends up partnering with a young male wolf who had been taken from the human family that raised it by some unsavory characters that now seemed determined to do harm to Jeebee. The pair escape together and the story ensues.Without describing the whole story, I will say that this was a good book. It covers a lot of deep thought concerning what it would take to survive in the wilderness and how the mind of a wolf works. It's obvious Dickson did his homework before writing this novel. I didn't read it with an overly critical eye. Didn't keep track of how many times Jeebee fired his rifle or how many shells he had left. Although it seemed like he should have run out at some point. If you like almost painfully detailed descriptions of how things are done by someone trying to survive the wilds with a wolf as a companion you might enjoy this book."}, {"userName": "Stephen Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Jul 31, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16992413-stephen-stewart", "userReview": "If you are looking for a Macgyver in a post apocalypse world, look no farther. \"Jeebee\" Walther, a scientist, is fleeing the remnants of civilization as he tries to make his way to his brothers farm. His goal is to find a way to protect his knowledge that predicted the collapse of society and store it for when it is needed in the future. The novel starts out strong, as Jeebee is a fish out of water, and he ends up rescuing and befriending a wolf. A large amount of the start of the novel explores their relationship and really is a treaty on wolves and their social interactions. This was probably the highlight of the novel. The low for me is when he's on his own towards the middle of the novel, is injured, and begins a long recovery mixed with Macgyver-ing absolutely everything. It's interesting, reminiscent of The Martian, but personally no where near as interesting to me. The novel lacks a lot of tension, and really just sort of ends with Jeebee deciding to stay where he is and never move on. It doesn't feel fulfilling or really live out the expectations established by a man who knows the science that can predict the end of the civilized world. Overall, Wolf and Iron is a solid novel, but unless you are interested in a novel ending with domestic bliss and a pages of the main character turning a cave into a house, I might recommend passing this novel. The wolf parts were pretty interesting, I have to admit that at least."}, {"userName": "Bill", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8762882-bill", "userReview": "Allow me to preface: I love Dickson, first of all, and second, I'm fully aware this book is a prize-winning novel. I love his attention to detail, and his wanting to make sure he imparts that he studied diligently the nature of wolves, how they act in the wild and in the social circle of humans. I appreciate that he wants to explain the nature of natural childbirth, and how to use weapons and shoot firearms. In reading, I'm tolerant of some of those expanded details. But, here it is slightly tedious, and at times bordering on OCD. As a writer, I identify more with lean and mean. Saying that makes it seem I didn't like the story; I did immensely. It pulled me through it quite successfully in fact. It's just that there was a wide dichotomy in the elements; what works, works powerfully on the level of WOW! What doesn't work brings on cosmic eye rolling. There are moments it reads like non-fiction with the author annoyingly present, but with the main scenes and the character and story arcs, it is some of the best I've ever read. I can see why it won an award, but there are parts that simply should have been left out, yet there is all evidence of economy. This was an interesting read and a good read.
