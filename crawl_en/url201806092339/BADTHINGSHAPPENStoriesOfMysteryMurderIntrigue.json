Cathi Stoler is a great story teller, and she really shines in the short market, though I do enjoy her novels too. She's build suspense and doesn't disappoint in the end. This is a great book for a trip or the beach because you can finish a story and pick it up to dig into a new the next chance you get. I do believe you'll enjoy it."}], "description": "From the first story of love gone horribly wrong, to the last where the good guy does the unthinkable to save his muse, this collection of short mystery fiction keeps the suspense coming. In between are stories of International intrigue, the cutthroat side of the book business, and someone whose luck is about to run out. Six stories to whet your appetite for the dark side of mystery, murder and deception.", "title": "BAD THINGS HAPPEN: 6 Stories Of Mystery, Murder & Intrigue", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33230604-bad-things-happen", "average": 4.75, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1480738731l/33230604.jpg", "reviews": 1, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/4807990.Cathi_Stoler", "name": "Cathi Stoler"}], "type": ["Thriller"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33230604-bad-things-happen", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11186947-telling-lies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19008767-nick-of-time", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21954815-the-hard-way", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18584977-keeping-secrets", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33006455-bad-things-happen"]}
