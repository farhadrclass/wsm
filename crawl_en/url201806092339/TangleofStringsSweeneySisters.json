Ms. Farley's attention to background information and details ensures Tangle of Strings can be read as a standalone.I like everyone in the extended Sweeney family, even Jackie, the dramatic high strung oldest sister, and mother of Cooper. I admired Flora Bell and her daughter, Thea, who was Annie's best friend. The characters I dislike are Thea's brothers, Tyrone and Willie, living on the wrong side of the law, intimidating others and referred to as the \"Evil Bell Brothers\".With only moments to get to work and her mind occupied by a troubling secret and an upsetting encounter with her estranged mother, sixteen-year-old Annie, unable to hold back the tears, speeds her Honda Accord towards town. Will Annie share her secret?What will Cooper do? Will Annie survive the accident?Will the Sweeney sisters help Annie?Will Annie be able to untangle the strings?I enjoy reading this series and highly recommend this thought provoking, heartbreaking and suspenseful story. 5 stars.Thanks to Ashley Farley for giving me an ARC of Tangle of Strings in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Sharon Metcalf", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/49089020-sharon-metcalf", "userReview": "A Tangle of Strings was recommended via a 5 star review from a GR friend.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I liked the sound of the book and am glad I decided to give it a try.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 This is exactly the sort of book I've always enjoyed in the past and I'm glad to report this was no exception.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Although this was book 4 of the Sweeney Sisters series and I hadn't read any of the earlier books this one made a perfectly good stand alone story.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Whilst I might have been a little more enraptured with the characters had I been with the Sweeney family from the beginning of the series I quickly fell into their stories and found myself full of empathy for teenaged Annie and Cooper and the real life issues they faced.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I was disappointed this is where this series ends but on a positive note I was interested to read that Ashley Farley was inspired to write Saving Ben in honour of her much loved brother who died of an accidental overdose.\u00a0 Having enjoyed her writing I may just give that one a try.Thanks to Ashley Farley and NetGalley for the free electronic copy in exchange for an honest review."}, {"userName": "\u2615 Kimberly ", "userReviewDate": "Jul 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5082615-kimberly", "userReview": "Read during vacation and enjoyed."}, {"userName": "Vishaka Rajan", "userReviewDate": "Jan 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/52397834-vishaka-rajan", "userReview": "I received this novel as an advanced copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.I had no idea that this novel was a part of a series, but it became fairly obvious after the first few pages. Nevertheless, I decided to read this novel and base my opinions on only this one story. The Sweeneys have had their fair share of conflicts, but they have always managed to come together because of their sense of family, their love for each other, and their willingness to forgive. But the latest crisis may be the one that undoes them. At the heart of the matter are 16-year-old Annie Bethune, who is the ward of Faith and Mike Sweeney, and her boyfriend, Cooper. When Annie discovers that she is pregnant, she has to make a decision about what she is going to do. And while she appreciates everyone's support, she soon begins to feel like a puppet with everyone telling her what to do. As a family feud develops, Annie is unable to handle the pressure, and runs away ... right into the arms of danger.Most of the story is about Annie and the pregnancy. We hear each character's opinion on what they think she should, and we also see what motivates each characters' opinion. For instance, Faith has never been able to conceive so she wants Annie to keep the child. Cooper's mother, Jackie, wants Annie to have an abortion because she doesn't want Cooper's future to be ruined. The list goes on and on. While the story definitely explores all of the different viewpoints at length, many parts of this novel didn't work for me.Since I read this book out of order from the rest of the series, I was extremely confused by all of the family ties. Jackie is Faith's sister, and there's someone named Eli who is connected in some other way, and then ... oh, it was just a lot to keep straight in my head! Maybe it is better explained in the previous novels, but I was getting lost a lot on these details and that took away my focus from the story itself. I also found that there were way too many subplots and motivations going on, and it made the story more convoluted instead of complex. There really wasn't much of a focus throughout the story, and it made everything so muddled. Because of all of this, I felt like the seriousness of the issue being discussed in this novel wasn't handled well; the way the characters were dealing with it and talking about the consequences was really childish and tactless. Even the way in which the characters spoke was unbelievable and immature. In the end, this novel let me down because it didn't handle the gravity of the situation well and came off as being very immature."}, {"userName": "Sharon", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28180449-sharon", "userReview": "I was given the opportunity to read an electronic copy of Tangle of Strings via NetGalley. This is my honest opinion of the book.Tangle of Strings is the fourth book in the series surrounding the Sweeney sisters: their life choices, trials, and tribulations that seem to make them stronger as a family in the end. After losing her father to illness, 16 year old Annie has finally found happiness living with Faith, Mike, and Bitsy. Her mom, Heidi, had abandoned Annie to search for stardom and left the little girl with her father, who was ill equipped to deal with the responsibilities. Although Heidi has returned to make amends and become part of the teenager's life, she succeeds in only pushing Annie further away. When Annie is involved in a traffic accident, her uncle asks questions at the hospital that give her reason to be worried. Between her injuries and her tenuous relationship with both Heidi and her ex-boyfriend Cooper, Annie's life decisions weigh heavily on her. Will Annie be able to choose what she feels is best for all concerned or will she be pressured by outside forces?Tangle of Strings goes a little too far into the Christian fiction realm for my taste. The subject of teen pregnancy can be navigated without bringing religion into it, but the author chose to tackle the issue using all sides. The story seemed unrealistic because the adults were so forceful in their convictions and did not listen to the couple in question. The dialogue seemed more like a way to discuss an agenda instead of important life decisions. The choice, and the ultimate decision, were almost an afterthought. With forced discussions and choppy sentence structure, Tangle of Strings was not as successful as the previous books. Readers who are new to the series may be lost, as there is too much history that is not passed forward from the earlier books. Tangle of Strings was a miss for me and is not a book that I would heartily recommend."}, {"userName": "Care", "userReviewDate": "Dec 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/60613428-care", "userReview": "Tangle of Strings is the story of Annie Bethune and her struggling through her recently reappeared birth mother, the desires and pressures of her legal guardians and de-facto adopted family, and her relationship with Cooper in the face of a family crisis. **some mild spoilers below**The novel is a rushed, confusing conglomeration of many different plot lines all intersecting and intertwining. Eli, a member of the extended family of Annie's legal guardians, is a policeman involved in a sting trying to bring down two drug-dealing, pimp brothers. Cooper, Annie's boyfriend, loves her but is trying to leave the town with no strings. Heidi, her birth mother, reappears and reinserts herself in Annie's life, despite her unhappiness with that (there is also a minor plot where Heidi is dating her landlord who comes across as not quite so great but this isn't further explored). Faith, Annie's legal guardian, struggles with her infertility and inability to have a child with her husband Mike. And Annie finds herself pregnant as the result of one night's confusing events, catalyzing a whole host of relatives asserting their opinions and pressures. The novel seems to lack focus and clarity because of the multiple plot lines and intersecting familial relations. As a result, it rushes through a very serious topic and its ramifications in a slightly tactless and unuanced manner where no one seems particularly mature or respecting of Annie's thoughts (even Annie herself, in unconvincing changes of mind), and where ultimately something happens that removes the decision from their hands. Because of the fast pace of the novel and all the characters and thoughts involved, the novel didn't really seem to delve into any character very deeply or conclude any plot particularly satisfactorily. The events and thoughts attributed to characters were not particularly realistic, and it was difficult to really enjoy the novel. Thanks to the publisher for an advance digital copy."}, {"userName": "DJ Sakata", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18344018-dj-sakata", "userReview": "Favorite Quotes:Heidi and Hugh had talked about everything.

A vision of his driving his redneck machine down the crowded streets of Manhattan, surrounded by yellow taxicabs and big city buses, caused his daydream to come to a screeching halt. Maybe New York wasn\u2019t the best place for him after all. My Review:I don\u2019t think I will ever tire of the Sweeney sisters and their odd collection of extended family members. Tangle of Strings is book four and I am more intrigued with them than ever before. Cozy up in your favorite chair and nestle in as the plot is boiling over with twists and turns of family tension, medical complications, police action, wry humor, and a resurfacing of the diva drama llama known as the old Jackie from book one. Poor Annie \u2013 she suffers through several trying incidents and has an extremely stressful and eventful stretch of time where she is constantly under pressure from all sides and has the entire family at odds.

Her mother abandoned her as a baby and has just come back into her life and wants to develop a relationship with her. Since Annie is under the guardianship of the family, this creates turmoil for them. As the book begins, Annie (driving too fast on main street) is in a bad accident and ends up in the hospital. The ER doctor, also part of the Sweeney family, has to ask her if there is any chance she is pregnant. The answer incites a huge family uproar as they try to make a decision about what Annie and Cooper (her estranged boyfriend) should do. They don't stop to realize that the decision really belong to Annie and Cooper. Along with the family drama, there is a sub-plot that is very intense.I loved this book and these characters. I hope that there are future books to this series because I enjoyed reading about the lives of the Sweeney family members.

Although fourth in the Sweeney Sisters series, the book can easily be read as a stand alone novel. The author does a good job of filling in enough of the back stories that one does not get lost in missing details. The focus in this book is on the teenagers of the family, Annie and Cooper, and the decisions that need to be made, the dreams that need to be considered and why can't the adults just let them find their way? So many opinions and which one is right? Will there be a family feud or will love and reason prevail? The story is fast paced with real-life situations that Farley infuses with drama and emotional tension. The characters are true-to-life and evocative--readers will get caught up in their lives.

Finally taking the focus off of Sam, this new book allows the readers to get some insight into the minds of Annie, Cooper, Sam's new husband, Eli, and Heidi, Annie's mother who abandoned her. This actually proved to work out well, because it allowed the story to expand in regards to the type of attachments the reader can make with the characters.Annie is the primary focus of this book and I found myself surprisingly connecting with the young girl and sympathized with the predicament she finds herself in. The three Sweeney sisters don't make life easier as Annie faces a life changing decision and honestly, the predicament furthered my dislike of Jackie as a whole. If I had to save a Sweeney sister from a drowning boat, let's just say Jackie wouldn't make the top two list.The thing I did find to be interesting about this whole ordeal was the development of Heidi. I am by no means a fan of this character and I completely agreed with Annie's anger towards the woman. But I found it to be interesting that as a reader, I was allowed so much insight to Heidi's personality and past. Most authors would have stayed with just Annie's point of view and I think it helps to smooth out my initial irk toward the character.As for Eli's parts of the story, I'll be honest, I could have liked this book with or without his chapters. I suppose this is more of a personal choice, as I've been increasingly annoyed with characters in law enforcement after years of the same ole same. But none of this is the fault of the writing, it's just a personal choice. I didn't feel his storyline was really needed and the drama it brings to the book, doesn't help to make this book good. The book was strong without it, in my opinion. But on the other hand, it helped to introduce new characters from their small town and hopefully, they'll continue to play a role in the future books.All in all, I really enjoyed this book. Perhaps my like for the story comes from my own personal experiences, but I felt a real connection with many aspects of Annie's story. It's those kinds of connections that can really leave a reader wanting more and I can honestly say I can't wait to see what kind of trouble they all find themselves in next.I received this book from the author in exchange for a review.

It is heart wrenching in places, keeps you on the edge of your seat in others and gives you a ringside seat into family squabbles where everyone is right and wrong but too stubborn to see the other side.The main focus of this book is Annie, who is a half sibling to Jamie (Samantha's son). She is 16 and has a streak of bad luck that sets up the story in this book. She is put into some situations that many teens face on a daily basis and I felt like the portrayal was pretty accurate. It doesn't help that some of these situations bring out the worse in Jackie and Faith and that inadvertently makes things worse and might be the cause why some things even happened. I know...vague, but when you read the book you'll understand! Let's just say they are acting like how most parents would act faced with various situations.I felt for Annie and while she made decisions that she could based on the time and situation, I wondered how I might react if I were in her shoes. Annie does learn a lot in this book (which spans about a week) and while some situations are sad and others are scary, they leave a good message for anyone reading the book to look at all sides of a situation.I do hope there might be another book to continue the saga, but if not it ended on a good note and it is left open for more books to follow."}, {"userName": "Alicia", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/39826582-alicia", "userReview": "A true gemThis is Annie's story. A bit from the past but mostly represent. She has to work her way through several trials and tribulations in this novel. While she may be 16, life handed her a difficult and challenging first 16 years, where she often was the more of a parent figure than child. She feels stuck, at times, between being treated as and acting as a teen versus the \"adult\" she often feel she is. This has led her to feel smothered within the Sweeney family while also feeling loved. In some respects this is also the whole Sweeney families story. They show that one can argue and disagree even say nasty words and have.major communication issues, yet in the end family and honesty is what really matters and keeps them together.
