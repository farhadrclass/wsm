Darling, why must you make it so easy ? No, dear, (for once) I don\u2019t mean for the men. I mean for everyone else in the world who goes into this book just looking for an excuse to make fun of you. I would say that most people don\u2019t know that much about France, but they do know a few things: that they like their baguettes, their socialism, Sartre, dirrrty dirrty sexy lurrrve and they despise this thing called the bourgeoisie. This book doesn\u2019t really do a thing to disprove any of this (though I can\u2019t say baguettes had a prominent place in the plot), and I expect that it had a great deal to do with starting the last two stereotypes. Emma, my dear, Desperate Housewives isn\u2019t your fault, but you can see why some people might blame you, don\u2019t you? Your constant, throbbing whining about how your (plentiful) food isn\u2019t served on crystal platters, how your dresses(of which you have more than a typical country doctor\u2019s wife) aren\u2019t made of yards of spider-spun silk, and most of all how your husband dresses wrong, talks wrong, thinks wrong, WEARS THE WRONG HAT (!!), and is so offensively happy with you that he enjoys coming straight home to tell you about his day and relax in front of his fireplace every night instead of going out drinking- well, there\u2019s a saying about the smallest violin, isn\u2019t there?It makes it easy for people to plausibly dismiss this story with things like this:(If it makes you feel better, dear, you are hardly the only one.. Your other compatriots in 19th century repressed female misery receive similar treatment:  )It is easy to despise you, Emma. You and your seemingly shallow priorities, the unthinking selfish harm you did to your husband AND your baby girl, the endless excuses you had for your, frankly, off the charts stupid behavior, the fact that you didn\u2019t even try and communicate how unhappy you were to the guy who loved you who might\u2019ve done something about it (since all the evidence shows that he is willing to COMPLETELY CHANGE HIS LIFE whenever you ask him to) and, finally (what can seem to be) the incredibly coward move you made in finding a way to not face the consequences your childish sense of the world couldn\u2019t believe would eventually come up. What goes around comes around  ,as the wise chanteur sayeth. (Perhaps the alternate cover above should substitute \u2018Justin Timberlake\u2019 for Sassy Gay Friend.)That\u2019s pretty much how I felt about you for about 150 pages after you made your entrance, Emma. While you started your endlessly copied, endlessly bastardized fall from Angel in the Home Grace, and while you tried to make a saint out of yourself for not having sex with a young clerk who couldn\u2019t have supported you anyway. You were simply the grandmother of Lady Chatterley, an extended protest letter to a dead king I couldn\u2019t care less about.But in the end, you won, Emma. I couldn\u2019t escape you. Seriously, y\u2019all, this book would not leave my head alone, for days, and I thought\u2026 many different and contradictory things about it. In the end, though, I kept coming back to one thought: the most terrifying thing I can think of is getting caught in Emma Bovary\u2019s eyes. Did everyone read that profile about Dan Savage this weekend about infidelity and marriage? I did. Emma is the literary incarnation of Savage\u2019s argument. Her eyes are on the cover of this book, and the more I looked at them, the more disturbed I got. Those eyes are the reason that marriage is so frightening, why \u2018commitment issues\u2019 exist. This is a novel about how reality can look just the same to you from one day to the next, but to your partner, it can have turned into a hell or a heaven, even if it is the same Tuesday routine as the last one. Emma\u2019s gaze, how each time she fixes her eyes on some scheme of happiness and how those eyes transform everything they see. She shows how unstable marriage is, how thin the foundations are- resting on nothing but the words- \u201cI love you.\u201d Words that just need one more word to dissolve the entire thing. That\u2019s it, you guys. One word and someone\u2019s will to speak it is all that stands between a solid marriage and one that is over- no matter how much paperwork you sign, how many kids you have, houses you fill with furniture. You never really know what the person across from you is thinking. How do you really know what motivates someone? Are they with you because they have made a resolution to be? Are they there with you because the stars shine in your eyes? Are they perfect to you because they are about to leave? Marriage, for better or worse, no matter what people say, adds so many complications. It is the commitment that people twist and bend over and around in so many different contortions to try to make it work- because it is a marriage, because it means something. How difficult is it to trust that people are simply what they say they are? Charles is simple and straightforward and rather sweet- and Emma hates him for it. She smiles and smiles and smiles\u2026 and then cheats on him, bankrupts him, tries to prostitute herself and kills herself rather than spend another day with him. This is the most anxiety inducing book I have ever read about marriage. It\u2019s the 19th century where you have to make a vow for life that you can't get out of, not really, in order to test the idea that you might want to be with someone. If you're wrong, that's it. You've failed. It\u2019s all-or-nothing. Emma is the incarnation of the expectations of the institution at the time- all-or-nothing. Madame Bovary is destroyed because she tries to put her all into Charles, then Rodolphe and then Leon, and none of them can withstand it. Each of them are good for different things, and only for a little while, and she can't accept it. That is not the ideal. She won't accept less than the ideal. You guys, she's nothing more than exactly what she is told is available to her- granted, she's after the best of what she's told is available: the ideal. But why do we hold that against her? As long as we live in a society where we\u2019re told to strive after the ideal, to never give up, you will have people who destroy themselves and everyone around them to get it. Savage\u2019s discussion of what the \u201cideal\u201d means in real life is enlightening and pertinent here, I think. He talks about how you have to be willing to change a lot and make a huge effort to keep the deal of monogamy alive. Of course everyone has their limits, and in many marriages, the trade offs of one person\u2019s limits for the others (I won\u2019t do this, and you won\u2019t do that- I won\u2019t do that, but I will do this) end up making the deal of monogamy work. But you have to be honest about it, you have to be able to say things that you\u2019ve never said out loud before. You have to admit that you won\u2019t be happy unless you live a life where you have crystal knickknacks on your fireplace, and you get off from pies being thrown in your face. But it\u2019s not that easy- Emma was on her deathbed, writhing in agony from eating arsenic, and she still couldn\u2019t tell Charles what she wanted from him.I can\u2019t blame Emma, ultimately. It actually made me think, of all things, a bit about Planet of Slums. That book talks about the millions of people who have been born outside the system, in illegal settlements to parents who are illegal themselves, and who are not, in fact, ignored by the system. They never get into the system in the first place- a system that is not built to cope with the mind-blowing poverty that arises from its excrement. The system can\u2019t acknowledge it and justify itself. At the risk of sounding like I think relatively-well-off white lady problems bear any resemblance to the horror of someone living on the outskirts of Kinshasa in a lean-to, Emma is just trying to get in to a society that can't acknowledge her and go on. She\u2019s trying with all her might to buy into the fairy tales she\u2019s been told (just like the revived, and growing belief in magic in some slums), and does whatever she has to do to get her hands on it, even if only for a little while. She saw that fairy tales are real (or so she thinks) at that ball that one time- she SAW it, mommy- and can\u2019t handle the fact that they exist on this earth and she can\u2019t be a part of it. And in case anyone finds her head-in-the-sand refusal to face the world overly childish or impossible to relate to: The endless line of irresponsible credit she takes out from the scam artist down the street in order to feed her fantasies about the way she believes her life should look has obvious immediate relevance to America in the pre-2008 financial crisis era. In some ways, the existential crisis Flaubert is trying to outline here: between a solidly practical, profit-and-advancement outlook on life and a sensibility that at least tries to aspire to something higher, even if it is unaffordable or impossible, is the distilled essence of the push and pull of American partisan politics. Monsieur Homais would have done very well on Wall Street. Emma can be read as being more American than French, really. Emma is a true believer. She doesn\u2019t just want attention from men, or shiny things. I didn\u2019t really believe that until the part where she tries to renounce the whole world for fervent religious devotion. Failing making it into her fairy tale, she wants to escape where she is- to somewhere else, anywhere else. By the end, I felt like I was suffocating right along with her. Virginia Woolf said that the  \u201cpresent participle is the devil\u201d . Emma adds the present place, the present time, the present person you are with. She really is willing to try anything to escape. On her deathbed, as she pleaded to die, my heart was racing along with hers and the whole finale read like a blockbuster last action scene with explosives and severed limbs flying. I didn\u2019t enjoy the journey I had with her, but I had made it and lived in tiny spaces with her, spaces that got ever smaller as the book wound down. Every chapter there was less and less light until she was curled up in a ball in solitary confinement with no hope of escape. In the Count of Monte Cristo, we root for the hero to get thrown over the side of a cliff in a body bag because it is his only hope of escape. How could we do less for poor Emma? She deserves her chance to make it to the place she always hoped for- even if priests and businessmen argue whether she got there over her corpse. If she can\u2019t be buried in \u2018blessed\u2019 ground, well, at that point the priest\u2019s God is just another man telling her she has to stay in the woods with the witch and her oven rather than try to find the path home, like she was always taught to do. Flaubert handles his prose deftly, precisely, and with a deceptively commonplace hand. He doesn\u2019t try for smart metaphors and delicate similes, but rather has characters say what the mean in an effectively believable way that makes Emma a character who can impact the lives of real women. Parts of this novel are spine-tinglingly sordid, others wrench out your gut, most of it can be drearily, boringly, mind-numbingly quotidian, and every so often, a gem shines through that makes you turn around and look at someone you had thought you were done being interested in. In other words, it\u2019s like last Wednesday. And the Tuesday before that. And today. And probably next Monday. The morning when you woke up vowing that today it was all going to be different, that afternoon when you just wanted to die, the evening when you forgot it all making dinner and laughing about that thing you saw on the internet.Flaubert can\u2019t get it all, or say it all right, but he knows that. In fact, he\u2019s willing to tell his readers that. But he does it in such a way that you just want to punch him in the face like you do that size 0 model who complains that she\u2019s too fat:\u201cWhereas the truth is that fullness of soul can sometimes overflow in utter vapidity of language, for none of us can ever express the exact measure of his needs or his thoughts or his sorrows; and human speech is like a cracked kettle on which we tap crude rhythms for bears to dance to, while we long to make music that will melt the stars.\u201dAw, come on, Gustave. Why do you want to make those of us with irrevocably not-size-0 rears, who can\u2019t get from Q to R, cry? Yet, even your complaining makes me want to hug you.I guess what I am saying is why are you so awesome, Monsieur Flaubert?"}, {"userName": "DeLaina", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/856197-delaina", "userReview": "This is one of the books that has had a profound effect on my life. The moral? Be happy with what you have and where you are!!! Mme. Bovary fritters away her entire life with thoughts of, \"If only X would happen, THEN I could be truly happy\" and yet she never is. She gets everything she thinks she wants only to find out she's still not content.I read this while I was engaged and at the time, thought, \"Well, I'll be happier when I'm married, but once I am, then life will be fabulous\". After a few years I found myself playing the same role as Mme. Bovary: \"Once I can get pregnant and have kids, then I'll be happy\"; \"Once I'm not pregnant and sick anymore, THEN I can be happy\"; \"Once we get out of this apartment and into our house, then I will surely be happy\"; \"Once the baby starts sleeping through the night, I can definitely be happy\"; \"Once the baby is out of diapers...etc. etc. ad nauseum...literally!I want to be content with my circumstances, whatever they may be, and Mme. Bovary is a reminder of what happens to those who are unable to find contentment in the journey, and are continually seeking yet another unsatisfying destination."}, {"userName": "Jeanette  \"Astute Crabbist\"", "userReviewDate": "Mar 13, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/796425-jeanette-astute-crabbist", "userReview": "Oy, the tedium, the drudgery of trying to read this book! I tried to get into this story. Really, I did. It's a classic, right? And everyone else likes it. I kept making myself continue, hoping I could get into the story and figure out what's supposed to be so good about it.I won't waste any more of my precious reading time on this. It's about a self-absorbed young wife who longs for anyone else's life except her own. When she's in the city, she dreams of the farm. When she's in the country, she dreams of the city. When she's at a social gathering she imagines that everyone else's life is so much more exciting than her own. Blah, blah, blah. Too many wordy descriptions of what people were wearing, what the buildings looked like, etc. If you're going to take a long time to tell a story, it had better be a good story.

The self-obsessed Emma Bovary was obviously (to me) a side of Flaubert himself. She feels that there is so much more but her limited life fences her in and instead of drawing into herself, seeing what she has to offer, how to make the best of herself, she wants happiness to come to her just as it does in the romance novels she, and Flaubert, read.I understood that spiritual flailing around, turning this way and that, using looks to make up for depth, using sex to pass for love, and enjoying fooling those she lived with into believing what they saw was what they got. We've all been a bit shallow at times, but to have made a whole career, a whole life of it, no! But then Emma departs from the author and becomes entirely his creation. She doesn't think forward, thinks her beauty will solve all. Thinks that those who say they love her don't mean they love having an affair, having sex, with her but that they love her deeply and for all time. Not that she is capable of loving that way herself either, so maybe she really didn't know what it meant. Her idea of love is the bodice-ripper, secret affair, always-exciting, happily-ever-after variety, except her affairs die when the men are satiated with this demanding woman. She can't even conceive of real-life nurturing of her child or being supportive, that's for fools like her husband. She always thinks someone will be there to pamper her and indulge her and that there will never be any consequences, that the piper will not call round to be paid for his pretty tune. Such a sad story, so beautifully written and it deserves a far better review than these few lines but I felt like writing down my first reaction on finishing the book, I don't want the emotions to wear off and have to analyse it critically, it wasn't that sort of experience for me."}, {"userName": "Helen \u03a1\u03bf\u03b6\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03af \u0395\u03c9\u03c3\u03c6\u03cc\u03c1\u03bf\u03c2

come, she must, she thought, have been mistaken. And Emma tried to find out what one meant exactly in life by the words felicity, passion, rapture, that had seemed to her so beautiful in books.\nYou might be surprised to learn that I was mesmerized by Emma\u2019s life story. I was mesmerized and suffered along with her as she capsized further and further into the ambushes life presented her. Yes, I felt like I was in a trance and could not escape. Oh, Emma, dear Emma, why do people hate you so? Why did you make them feel that way? I am sorry for being so blunt. You, and your seemingly shallow priorities, gave your critics plenty of ammunition. You did the unthinkable. What excuse did you have for such a selfish, impulsive and futile behavior? Did you by any chance hear Virginia Woolf say 'You cannot find peace by avoiding life.'? What did you have to dive head first before she even professed this truth? But you might have overdid it, don\u2019t you agree with me?\nThe horror of being a woman with no choices\u2026\nAs I read on, I kept coming back to one thought: the most terrifying thing I can think of is getting caught in Emma Bovary\u2019s life. She was not alone in her infidelity, did you know that? Not in her time, not today. What about the reason for marriage? She married to escape, I know. And she hoped for a better life. I don\u2019t believe she loved Charles, not even in the beginning. Maybe she romanced him, what woman would not do it in her place?\n\u2026sitting on the grass that she dug up with little prods of her sunshade, Emma repeated to herself, \"Good heavens! Why did I marry?\"She asked herself if by some other chance combination it would have not been possible to meet another man; and she tried to imagine what would have been these unrealised events, this different life, this unknown husband. All, surely, could not be like this one. He might have been handsome, witty, distinguished, attractive, such as, no doubt, her old companions of the convent had married\u2026 But she\u2014her life was cold as a garret whose dormer window looks on the north, and ennui, the silent spider, was weaving its web in the darkness in every corner of her heart.\nAnd I remembered Jane Austen, who opened the door for woman to search for happiness in their marriage. Why did women marry in those times? Women married only to increase their social standing or for money, but with Austen they start to have a chance at happiness. Flaubert does something similar with Madame Bovary, I believe. He accuses the status quo, the position of women, in a circumvented way, by showing us Emma\u2019s deep unhappiness and how her actions condemned her and society. Poor Emma. I pitied her for each time she fixed her gaze on some scheme of happiness and how her eyes led her astray.\nThen the lusts of the flesh, the longing for money, and the melancholy of passion all blended themselves into one suffering, and instead of turning her thoughts from it, she clave to it the more, urging herself to pain, and seeking everywhere occasion for it. She was irritated by an ill-served dish or by a half-open door; bewailed the velvets she had not, the happiness she had missed, her too exalted dreams, her narrow home.\nThe only pastime she could enjoy without guilt was reading. From that she built fantasies, it is true. But did she not have the right at least of her own fantasies? It seems not, as we overhear Charles and her mother in law talking:\n\"Do you know what your wife wants?\" replied Madame Bovary senior. \"She wants to be forced to occupy herself with some manual work. If she were obliged, like so many others, to earn a living, she wouldn't have these vapours, that come to her from a lot of ideas she stuffs into her head, and from idleness in which she lives.\"\"Yet she is always busy,\" said Charles.\"Ah! always busy at what? Reading novels, bad books, works against religion, and in which they mock at priests in speeches taken from Voltaire. But all that leads you far astray, my poor child. Anyone who has no religion always ends up turning badly.\"So it was decided to stop Emma reading novels.\nAs if she had the choice of earning a living, being a female. What hypocrisy! The only choice they see to avoid her turning badly is to forbid her reading her novels. One of the few pleasures she was allowed.In a time that judged everyone by their wealth; that breathed a suffocating morality deceptively reinforced mainly by women themselves, society would be horrified by women\u2019s pursuit of anything more than their obligations. On top of all that isn\u2019t it understandable that Emma would pray for a son when she got pregnant? \n She hoped for a son; he would be strong and dark; she would call him George; and this idea of having a male child was like an expected revenge for all her impotence in the past. A man, at least, is free; he may travel over passions and over countries, overcome obstacles, taste of the most far-away pleasures. But a woman is always hampered.\nShe was so right, men at least were much more free than women. I not only comprehend her reasons, but commiserate with her. So, why look at a baby girl she knew had been born with the wrong gender! It all went against her most heartfelt dreams. Emma might have towards the end had a touch of evil brought by desperation. But who wouldn't?\nAmbushes and pitfalls...\nOh, she tried to renounce all her dreams through moments of fervent religious devotion. At mass on Sundays, when she looked up, she saw the gentle face of the Virgin amid the blue smoke of the rising incense. Then she was moved\u2026 Intrigue, however, had already tempted her and kept coming her way. Why would she be invited and attend a ball in a house so out of her reality? Was it not a trap? After that, you could not help yourself but wish you had access to that fairy like life. What an ambush, when she was attempting to behave:\nHer journey to Vaubyessard had made a hole in her life, like one of those great crevices that a storm will sometimes make in one night in mountains. Still she was resigned. She devoutly put away her beautiful dress, down to the satin shoes whose soles were yellowed with the slippery wax of the dancing floor. Her heart was like these. In its friction against wealth something had come over it that could not be effaced.\nSuch a fortuitous event served only to stress the undesirability of her life. \nAfter the ennui of this disappointment her heart once more remained empty, and then the same series of days recommenced. So now they would thus follow one another, always the same, immovable, and bringing nothing. Other lives, however flat, had at least the chance of some event. One adventure sometimes brought with it infinite consequences and the scene changed. But nothing happened to her; God had willed it so! The future was a dark corridor, with its door at the end shut fast.\nAnother bait would present herself in the person of Monsieur Lheureux. He began cajoling Emma quite innocently for the first time when offering her to buy some scarves,  'I wanted to tell you, he went on good-naturedly, 'that it isn\u2019t the money I should trouble about. Why, I could give you some, if need be.' Thus, another temptation felt into her lap like a dream come through. The endless line of irresponsible credit was not more than an option offered her that she could not have imagine existed if were not for this trickster.Later we witness how she tries to reform, to be more tolerant and wishing to endure her life as it was, taking responsibility for her daughter and taking interest in the housework. Just then up comes Monsieur Rodolphe Boulanger, who after first meeting Madame Bovary '[s]he is very pretty', he said to himself, 'she is very pretty, this doctor\u2019s wife.' And he goes on, 'I think he is very stupid. She is tired of him, no doubt. She is gaping after love like a carp after water on a kitchen-table. Yes, but how to get rid of her afterwards?' He decides so easily to seduce her. Oh, yes, she went along with it and of her free will. But it was too much temptation, for someone so thirsty. I imagined that if it was not Rodolphe it would be another. And later on came Leon. After the affair with Rodolphe begins, Emma marvels at how much she had lacked living before:\n\"I have a lover! a lover!\" delighting at the idea as if a second puberty had come to her. So at last she was to know those joys of love, that fever of happiness of which she had despaired! She was entering upon marvels where all would be passion, ecstasy, delirium. An azure infinity encompassed her, the heights of sentiment sparkled under her thought, and ordinary existence appeared only afar off, down below in the shade, through the interspaces of these heights.\nThus, Flaubert puts all these temptations in her way. It is as if Emma when walking down a meadow starts to stumble on beautiful, ripe apples that lie on the ground and cannot resist but pick some and take a few bites. Could she have resisted them all?\nBut could Emma have escape her destiny?\nCould she have simply accepted life as it was offered to her?, with all its constraints and no reward... I believe all that she lived was utterly inevitable. Could she have run away from her own behavior and avoided her ultimate destiny? Emma was on the same boat as Oedipus found himself in. I felt after reading Oedipus Rex that there was not really anything that Oedipus could have done to get himself out of his destiny. Could Emma have done it differently? It seemed to me that the more Oedipus attempted to get out of it, the deeper he was immersed in its inevitability. It is simply that there was no way for him to avoid doing it all and facing his fate. Was Emma\u2019s destiny any less inevitable? I do not believe so. There was no chorus to declare that to us, but Flaubert himself serves the role, even if it is not so explicit and you have to read between the lines:\nIt seemed to her that the ground of the oscillating square went up the walls and that the floor dipped on end like a tossing boat. She was right at the edge, almost hanging, surrounded by vast space. The blue of the heavens suffused her, the air was whirling in her hollow head; she had but to yield, to let herself be taken; and the humming of the lathe never ceased, like an angry voice calling her.\n\nAnd so it all ends\u2026\nBut as in the beginning in the end, you beguiled me Emma. I was with you from the start and you could not escape me even in death. Seriously, I tell all your critics, your tragic story would not leave me alone. It still doesn\u2019t. You had no choice like Oedipus could not escape killing his father or marrying his mother. So, why people do not stop condemning you when they pity him?You were clever and wanted to exercise your intellect. Imagine the frustration of nothing to do? Perhaps your mother in law was right, you were fated to end badly. What a tragedy of never finding someone that could begin to understand you. Flaubert with his impressive prose evokes her thoughts and feelings throughout the novel, and I had no choice but be enticed by his heroine.\n...it seemed to her that Providence pursued her implacably, ...she had never felt so much esteem for herself nor so much contempt for others... She would have liked to strike all men, to spit in their faces, to crush them, and she walked rapidly straight on, pale, quivering, maddened, searching the empty horizon with tear-dimmed eyes, and as it were rejoicing in the hate that was choking her.\nFinally, I think I was able to grasp the reasons that make Madame Bovary a classic, a modern tragedy where a soul is doomed because she appreciates and battles against all that comes her way. Despite her limitations in life and as a product of her time, Emma has an unbridled passion and ends pursuing her fantasies. That ends condemning her. Nevertheless, Emma Bovary is brave in her irresponsible choices because it brings her closer to the happiness she wants, even if doing so she is able to attain only a glimpse of her dreams. Even if for that she had to die. And she died so that other women could strive for a more compassionate fate.___"}, {"userName": "Nayra.Hassan", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2016", "userURL":

"userReview": "Since I read Quicksand by Nella Larsen this week, Emma Bovary started haunting my mind yet again!We are old friends, Emma and I. I spent hours and hours over a dictionary at age seventeen in high school, trying to read about her agonies in original French, with only the Isabelle Huppert film as a guidance. In fact, I actually think I owe it to Emma Bovary that I finally made it over the threshold to understand written French. That ultimately led me to university studies in French literature, and a lifelong love for French writers. In a way, I could argue that Emma introduced me to Diderot and Voltaire, I guess.But she did so much more for me, as well. She awakened in me a sense that the world holds different options for women and men, and that women's dreams are dangerous, detrimental and slightly sentimental and ridiculous. She made me socially, politically angry for the first time. I know there are thousands of erudite studies showing all the weaknesses of Emma Bovary, but from the start, I could not - would not - see her that way. I was with her when she danced in the ballroom, and I wished the party would never end. I hated the conventional goodness of Charles, and understood Emma's frustration with him better than his frustration with her. After all, she had ideas, dreams, longings, and he had: routine, reputation and boredom.I rejoiced that she dared to do what men have always, always allowed themselves to do: enjoy a sexual life of her own choice. She knew she would pay a much higher price than any man ever would for that freedom. I loved the fact that she embraced life in its passion and pain, and I suffered through the horrifying pages of her brutal final agony with the feeling that I would not have wanted her to say no to one single piece of experience in exchange for a better end - living according to her husband's standards would have been death over and over, without end.I am fully aware that this is not a moral reading or interpretation of the novel, and I don't encourage or follow her choices in real life, but I loved Emma Bovary's daring rebellion without limits when I was young, and it has never actually changed. Whenever I remember my encounter with Emma, the first thought invariably is: \"Go girl! Do what you want!\"To close the circle: reading Larsen's Quicksand made me think of Emma because the character Helga Crane, not fully belonging anywhere, and drifting from one place to the next, never really lives her dreams fully. She always pulls out, runs away, hides from too strong emotions, and in the end, she resigns herself to rural life with a preacher she hates, and multiple pregnancies to bind her to the hopeless boredom and tedium. Reading about Helga, I found myself thinking again with fondness of Madame Bovary: \"Go girl! Do what you want!\""}, {"userName": "Kat Kennedy", "userReviewDate": "Jan 23, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3270188-kat-kennedy", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Orsodimondo", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10490224-orsodimondo", "userReview": "C'EST MOI Meravigliosa come sempre, semplicemente perfetta, Isabelle Huppert nell\u2019adattamento del 1991 firmato da Claude Chabrol.Letto un paio di volte e sempre amato. Uno dei massimi capolavori della letteratura, secondo me.Flaubert \u00e8 uno dei sommi: me lo immagino di notte, solo nella sua casa di Rouen, che sono ovviamente stato a visitare, al lume di candela, che 'recita' le parole scritte, ancora e ancora, urlandole, cancellando, limando, riscrivendo, fino a trovare la formula giusta, quella perfetta. Le mot juste. Perch\u00e9, lui \u00e8 con la perfezione che si misurava. E alla perfezione si \u00e8 avvicinato, e, secondo me, la perfezione ha raggiunto.Realistico, il romanzo certamente lo \u00e8: non contiene nulla che non sia esistito nella vita reale (e facilissimo da riscontrare attraverso sopralluoghi e testimonianze); e anche se sbuffa ogni tanto \"nulla in questa storia \u00e8 tratto dalla vita, \u00e8 totalmente inventata\", non c'\u00e8 dubbio che questo autore ha seguito con scrupolo il precetto dello 'scrivere solo di ci\u00f2 che si conosce'.

The eternal story of Emma Bovary and her broken dreams is heartbreaking every time.The narration is actually quite modern in that the perspective changes quite often from a mysterious first person in the beginning (a schoolmate of Charles Bovary?) to the interior monologues of Charles, Emma, L\u00e9on, and Rodolphe. The descriptions of the various locations in the book are always surprising with tiny references to the principle characters. It may surprise you to know that this book, which is essentially a tragedy, also is full of humor and sarcasm. For example, when L\u00e9on and Emma have a rendez-vous in the Cathedral of Rouen, the Swiss guard who tries to give them a tour of the church while L\u00e9on is freaking out and wants to get out of there while Emma pretends to be interested because she is not quite sold on the seduction is pure genius. In a similar, if more romantic vein, the whispered conversation of Rodolphe and Emma in the lodge as the vice-Prefect gives the world's most boring speech (his boss couldn't be bothered to come) was extraordinary. Every word in Flaubert is measured and perfectly weighted to each situation, the original French is absolutely splendid - whether he is describing the pretentious conversation of M. Homais or the various season and their impact on the moods of the characters and tone of the novel. The only criticism that I can bring is that the denouement is a bit long - that being said, there is another fantastic ironic payoff in the last sentence.This book from 1856 is of course a product of the Romantic period in culture but it surpasses most of its contemporaries by its precise psychology - both of men and women, its irony, its subtle criticism of the \"petit bourgeois\" and French society, and the meticulous observation of detail. Even 161 years later, it remains a monument of literature and a summit of free expression (Flaubert was pursued in court and beat the censors.)"}, {"userName": "Martine", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/381149-martine", "userReview": "Like every European teenager who takes French at secondary school, I was supposed to read Madame Bovary when I was seventeen or so. I chose not to, and boy, am I glad I did. I couldn't possibly have done justice to the richness of Flaubert's writing as a seventeen-year-old. Moreover, I probably would have hated the characters so much that I never would have given the book another chance. Which would have been a shame, as it's really quite deserving of the tremendous reputation it has.Madame Bovary is the story of Emma Rouault, a mid-nineteenth-century peasant woman who has read too many sentimental novels for her own good. When the hopeless romantic marries Charles Bovary, a country doctor, she thinks she is going to lead a life full of passion and grandeur, but instead she gets stuck in a provincial town where nothing ever happens. Hell-bent on some escapism and yearning for someone who understands her romantic needs, Emma embarks on two adulterous affairs, plunges herself into debt and ends up very badly indeed, leaving behind a husband who might not have been the dashing hero of her dreams but who most certainly did care about her. Madame Bovary is most famous for its portrayal of an unfulfilled woman, and indeed it's Emma's ennui and desperate need for romance that the reader will remember. They are described so convincingly that it's hard to believe the author was a man rather than a woman. However, Madame Bovary isn't all about one woman going through life dreaming and breaking down every time reality catches up with her. Like other great classics of realism, it's about society \u2013 about the social mores and conditions which instil certain kinds of behaviour in people and then punish them for it. Flaubert's depiction of Emma's provincial village (a haven of all that is base and mediocre) is painstakingly detailed and realistic. It's a wonderfully vivid and well-observed account of life in mid-nineteenth-century rural France, where people go about doing their jobs, conducting illicit affairs, gossiping behind each other's backs, ruining each other financially and generally leading lives which are far from exalted. Flaubert's portrayal of his characters is unabashedly vicious and misanthropic, but such is the quality of his writing that you forgive him for taking such a dim view of humanity. There are descriptions in the book (the seduction at the market, the club-foot operation, the endlessly prolonged death from arsenic poisoning) which rank among the best things nineteenth-century realism has to offer \u2013 gloriously life-like scenes which make you feel as if you're right there in the thick of things, watching things happen in front of your horrified eyes. And if the whole thing has a tragic and deterministic slant to it, well, so be it. That's realism for you. At least Flaubert has the decency to grant his heroine a few sighs of rapture before her inexorable demise. For it may be a realist novel, but it has some genuinely romantic moments of passion and drama (cab ride through Rouen, anyone?), and is all the better for it.Ultimately, how you respond to Madame Bovary depends on your own susceptibility to romantic notions. If, like Emma Bovary, you're prone to dreams of passion, beauty and perfection, and yearn to feel and experience rather than being stuck in a dreary life in a village where nothing ever happens, chances are you'll be able to relate to Emma and thus see the genius of Flaubert's depiction of her. If, on the other hand, you think that such romantic escapism is a lot of sentimental, self-indulgent claptrap (which it is \u2013 that's the tragedy of it!), you probably won't be able to relate to Emma at all, and therefore won't much appreciate her as a tragic heroine. As for myself, I'm definitely in the former camp. If I'd been Emma, I probably would have walked into the same traps that she does. I would have fallen in love with the one neighbour who seems to understand my need for intensity, I would have gone through the same mad cycle of repentance, dissatisfaction and making the same mistakes again, and I probably would have spent a bit too much money in my quest for soul-affirming experiences, as well. My ruin wouldn't have been as complete as Emma's, but it would have been fed by the same dreams and desires. Oh, yes. So don't let anyone tell you Madame Bovary is an old-fashioned creature whose dilemmas are no longer relevant to modern readers. There are plenty of people in modern society who are as much in love with romance itself as she is, and not just women, either. And as for discontent, how many people today aren't dissatisfied with their lives because they don't match the glamorous/exciting lives they see on TV? And how many people today don't rack up huge debts because the magazines they read have led them to believe that they're entitled to more than is within their means? Replace 'sentimental novels' by 'TV', 'movies' and 'magazines', and all of a sudden Emma's cravings won't seem so outdated any more. Quite the contrary; they're as timeless and universal as they ever were. That's the hallmark of a classic \u2013 it speaks to us from across a century and a half and shows us ourselves. We may not much like the picture of ourselves, but it's pretty powerful all the same.I'd give the book four and a half stars if I could, but alas. In the absence of half stars, four stars will have to do, with the assurance that it's well worth another half."}, {"userName": "Foad", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL":

"http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5498525-fionnuala", "userReview": "There\u2019s something about Flaubert\u2019s writing that makes me want to comment on his books as I\u2019m reading them. I had that experience with Bouvard et P\u00e9cuchet last year and I had it again while reading this book, so I jotted down my thoughts as I read.Part I jottings When you\u2019re reading such a famous story as this one, the ending of which everyone knows already, you read it differently. You dawdle along, indulging yourself with odd details. And so, in these early pages, I\u2019m admiring how Flaubert describes the part of France in which he has chosen to set his story: Haute-Normandie, his home territory. It\u2019s clear that he loves the countryside around Rouen very much.I\u2019m also enjoying the fact that there\u2019s more than one Madame Bovary in the story. Mme Bovary \u2018m\u00e8re\u2019 is a formidable lady who ushers in Madame Bovary \u2018belle-fille\u2019, formidable in her own way if not exactly \u2018belle\u2019. But Mme Bovary the second, in spite of faithfully taking the medicine prescribed by her doctor husband Charles, dies conveniently, allowing Madame Bovary the third, the very incarnation of \u2018belle\u2019, to be ushered in, bringing bag-loads of tension in her train. If she was a match, she\u2019d ignite all by herself.Now that he\u2019s set up his story, and described its landscape, I feel that Flaubert is really testing his writerly capacities. He\u2019s challenging himself to inhabit Madame Bovary the third\u2019s fiery spirit. He\u2019s good at this. He\u2019s so good at it that I wonder how he can keep it up. I\u2019m noticing too how often he describes the view from her window as she stares longingly at the broader world beyond the walls of her narrow life. That reminds me of something, though I\u2019m not sure what..And I have to smile at his foresight when he makes Emma Bovary wish that the name Bovary will become famous, that it will be displayed all over bookshops and repeated in the newspapers.But as the quiet pages turn, I find myself longing for a change for Emma and for me as a reader. Her world is too limited. What about the reader\u2019s needs, dear M Flaubert? Spare a thought for us.Emma is invited to a ball in the neighboring ch\u00e2teau and I think, yes, Flaubert is going to change the pace here, and he does. The comical descriptions of dinner at the chateau remind me of the humurous juxtapositions that occurred on every other page of Bouvard Et Pecuchet, and I can\u2019t help wishing this book could be more like that one. But unfortunately, the ch\u00e2teau episode is soon over and it hasn\u2019t delivered much in terms of change for Emma - or for the reader. Thoughts on Part IIThis section starts off with a little more promise. Emma and Charles are moving to Yonville, a little town in a valley by a meandering river. Flaubert describes the road leading to the town as bordered by young aspens, une chauss\u00e9e plant\u00e9e de jeunes trembles.The French word for aspen, \u2018tremble\u2019, immediately reminds me of Tennyson\u2019s lines from The Lady of Shalott:Willows whiten, aspens quiver, little breezes dusk and shiver, thro' the wave that runs forever by the island in the river, flowing down to Camelot. Four gray walls and four gray towers, overlook a space of flowers, and the silent isle imbowers, the Lady of Shalott.I remember the descriptions of Emma looking at the world through her window, and I think, Yes! Up to this point, Emma has been exactly like the enchanted Lady of Shalott, looking out at the world as if from a mirror, cut off from real life.Perhaps from her window in Yonville, she will see Sir Lancelot riding by...The town provides some interest for the reader in any case. We are introduced to a colorful set of inhabitants. There\u2019s Mme Lefran\u00e7ois, who runs the local hostelry; there\u2019s her club-footed man-of-all-work, Hippolyte; her regular customers: a querulous tax collector called M. Binet and a young lawyer\u2019s clerk called M. Leon Dupuis. Then there\u2019s a slimy haberdasher called M. Lheureux; the Rouen-Yonville stage-coach driver Hivert; a sanctimonious clergyman called M. Bournisien and a free-thinking but rather pedantic pharmacist called Homais. An immediate battle of words between the clergyman and the pharmacist livens up the story nicely. I welcome these new characters, no matter how sanctimonious or pedantic. And Homais reminds me quite a bit of Bouvard and P\u00e9cuchet, though admittedly Homais seems actually to know what he\u2019s talking about unlike that comic duo.But while introducing several interesting and comic characters, Flaubert is simultaneously playing with our expectations. He tells us there was little to see in Yonville - the single street, the length of a rifle\u2019s range, stopped short at the corner of the road. If you turned right at the end, you arrived at the cemetary. The mention of a street the length of a gun\u2019s range, and which comes to an abrupt end, combined with the mention of a cemetery, doesn\u2019t augur well at all.But perhaps I\u2019m wrong to focus on premonitions. On her first morning in her new home in Yonville, Emma looks out the window and sees the lawyer\u2019s clerk, Leon, go by. Is he Sir Lancelot? In any case, within the space of a few pages, he seems to have cheered Emma up considerably. I\u2019m cheered up too because I\u2019m really enjoying the contrast between the super scientific conversations which Homais engages in with everyone, and the super romantic conversation that Emma and Leon have at every opportunity.But Flaubert is still offering us hints about the future: Homais praises Emma\u2019s new house and mentions particularly the advantage of having a side door in an alleyway that allows people to enter and leave without being seen. The pages go by without much happening, and the side door remains unused. Oh, wait, something is happening. A bunch of characters are going on a day trip! How exciting!But it\u2019s only to visit a linen factory.In Part II, the character list may have expanded but life in Yonville Yawnville hasn't really become more interesting.Emma is increasingly bored and exasperated by her gentle husband Charles and by her narrow life in the town. I\u2019m feeling the same with regard to Flaubert. I absolutely can\u2019t find fault with the writing but the story is becoming just as much a torment for me to read as it is for Emma to live through.But a passage beginning, \u2018Un soir...\u2019 , and which mentions spring and buds, etc, brings hope - for the reader, at least.Alas, the passage ends with the church bells tolling in peaceful lamentation. Poor Emma. Poor me.And poor Leon has become so bored with Yawnville that he can\u2019t stand it any longer. He leaves without having once made use of that tempting side entrance. What has Emma to look forward to now? Oh right, an Agricultural Show\u2026But in the meantime, Emma has realised that Leon might have been her best chance at love and she missed it. Really, it goes from bad to worse. I\u2019m certain Flaubert was chuckling to himself as he wrote! But perhaps shedding a little tear too. His ability to perfectly phrase his character\u2019s thoughts excuses him a lot:C\u2019\u00e9tait cette r\u00eaverie que l\u2019on a sur ce qui ne reviendra plus, la lassitude qui vous prend apr\u00e8s chaque fait accompli, cette douleur enfin que vous apportent l\u2019interruption de tout mouvement accoutum\u00e9, la cessation brusque d\u2019une vibration prolong\u00e9e.Emma has bought herself a prie-dieu, a gothic kneeler. I can\u2019t believe Flaubert wrote that with a straight face.Oh! It\u2019s market day in Yawnville. Perhaps something will happen today...Why yes! From her window Emma spies a fine Sir Lancelot in yellow gloves. Or is it Mr Bingley? A single man with twenty thousand a year renting a house in the area, he must surely be in want of a....Ah! His name is not Bingley but Boulanger, Rodolphe Boulanger. He sounds as romantic as a red-nosed baker. But still, he\u2019s arrived just in time to escort Emma to the Agricultural Show! Who\u2019d have thought the Agricultural Show could turn into a romantic venue!And side by side with the romance, Flaubert offers us a comic interlude between Mme Lefran\u00e7ois and Homais, who according to Flaubert, has expressions to suit every circumstance, even unfortunate ones. Quelle \u00e9pouvantable catastrophe ! s\u2019\u00e9cria l\u2019apothicaire, qui avait toujours des expressions congruentes \u00e0 toutes les circonstances imaginables. Yes, I was right. This IS a comic novel! And now it\u2019s Emma who\u2019s described as having a red nose! Is Flaubert mocking his main character?Yes, he seems to be mocking everyone in the course of this Agricultural Show episode, juxtaposing contrasting scenes to great comic effect. While the local Deputy engages his large audience at a slow pace on the subject of cereal production, Rodolphe engages his tiny audience at a fast pace on the subject of serial seduction. The deputy is planning a venture involving manufacturing linen, Rodolphe is planning a venture involving bed linen!The comic strand has the upper hand in this section, and it may well be descending into complete farce because Homais is proposing a radical new medical procedure to cure Hippolyte\u2019s club foot. Is Flaubert trying to turn Homais, the supreme unbeliever, into a Messiah who will make the lame walk and the blind see? In the predictably disappointing aftermath of the miracle procedure, Flaubert gives us some great dialogues between the priest and the pharmacist. These are definitely my favourite parts. Meantime, Emma dialogues with her conscience on the subject of her affair with Rodolphe. Yes, you\u2019ve guessed right, the side door on the alley has been finally put to some use.But Rodolphe doesn\u2019t measure up to Emma\u2019s expectations, and his letter of adieu arrives by the unfaithful side-door. While I\u2019m reading Rodolphe\u2019s letter, I\u2019m distracted by the mention of a \u2018mancenillier\u2019 tree so I pause to look it up. It\u2019s a poison tree, a tree of death. Flaubert is amusing himself again.And even as Emma enters crisis mode, Flaubert makes Homais create a comic diversion. And then he gives Charles serious money troubles just to bring us back into serious mode again. In the next section, Flaubert cooly announces that Emma wants to become a saint! Elle voulut devenir une sainte. Am I the only one who notices this constant lurching between the serious and the farcical?Ok, she\u2019s now safely through the \u2018saint\u2019 crisis and Charles is going to take her to see \u2018Lucia de Lamermoor' at the Rouen opera house. This should be a serious episode but it\u2019s introduced by another farcical debate between the pharmacist and the priest. The two are stock comic characters. But romance prevails in spite of the comedy; Emma, like Lucia in the garden scene, meets her old love Leon at the opera.This more mature Leon turns out to be as calculating in his modest way as Rodolphe was, and he manages to get Charles to agree to Emma staying on an extra day in Rouen by herself. So the pair rendezvous at the cathedral which gives Flaubert an opportunity to indulge in flamboyant parallels between Emma\u2019s situation and the edifice itself. The cathedral is described as a gigantic boudoir, the vaulted ceiling extending its ribs like arms to receive Emma\u2019s confession of love for Leon, the stained glass illumining her face, the smoke from the incense burners creating an angelic halo, etc, etc.Someone convince me that Flaubert wasn\u2019t laughing when he wrote this. And there\u2019s a ridiculous person hanging around who insists on giving the pair a guided tour, especially of the Chapel of the Virgin under which is buried a Louis the Something, seigneur of something else, etc, etc, who died on the 23rd of July, a Sunday\u2026 The reference to the \u2018Sunday\u2019 is one detail too much for Leon. He flees the cathedral\u2019s suffocating arms dragging Emma behind him, and grabs a cab. Not just any cab of course. It has to be a cab that has blinds that can be pulled down completely. Flaubert sends the cabby and his two passengers on a crazy journey around and around the city so that people in the streets see the cab go by again and again and are amazed at the apparitions and reapparaitions of a shuttered vehicle in broad daylight. Phantasmagoric! When Emma gets back to Yawnville after the cab \u2018ride\u2019 there\u2019s bad news. But Flaubert can\u2019t just give us a simple delivery of bad news. No, the scene has to open with Homais castigating his apprentice for daring to unlock his medicine cabinet - where he has a bottle of arsenic locked away. Homais is so carried away that he expostulates in Latin and would have expostulated in Chinese or \u2018groenlandais\u2019 if he knew such languages! In the middle of all this expostulating, he conveys the bad news to Emma: Charles\u2019 father has died. The story moves on through many more chapters as Emma and Leon find possibilities for more rendezvous, sometimes described in ridiculous terms, sometimes in sublime ones: for Leon, Emma is the heroine of every novel and drama. She is the unnamed She of every love poem. But above all, she\u2019s an angel! This is heady stuff!Emma\u2019s stolen idylls cost money so she borrows and borrows on the strength of Charles\u2019 inheritance. Each time the story strikes such a serious note, Homais is called in to do another comic turn. The man who used to spout Latin at every opportunity suddenly starts peppering his conversation with slang terms to great effect: nous ferons sauter ensemble les monacos. L\u2019apothicaire, autrefois, se f\u00fbt bien gard\u00e9 d\u2019une telle expression ; mais il donnait maintenant dans un genre fol\u00e2tre et parisien qu\u2019il trouvait du meilleur go\u00fbt ; et, comme madame Bovary, sa voisine, il interrogeait le clerc curieusement sur les m\u0153urs de la capitale, m\u00eame il parlait argot afin d\u2019\u00e9blouir les bourgeois, disant turne, bazar, chicard, chicandard, Breda-street, et Je me la casse, pour : Je m\u2019en vais.Then for ten pages or so, there\u2019s no comic contrast. Flaubert is serious at last. Leon is gone - or as Homais might say, he\u2019s vamoosed. Emma is left with nothing but debts and broken dreams - described in the most beautiful language needless to say.Just when I\u2019d given up on any more comic turns, Homais comes to my rescue to advise against eating wheat and dairy products! There\u2019s nothing new in the world surely.And even when things worsen, he still manages to make me laugh. He declares that in cases of poisoning, the most important thing is to carry out a test. Follow the scientific method. Everything will be fine if you follow the scientific method and carry out tests.At the very worst moment after the famous doctors have arrived and given up on curing the poison victim, Homais feels obliged to entertain them at his house, sending out for pigeons and lamb chops, the best cream and eggs, and warning his wife to take out the wineglasses with the stems. He even dares to offer the famous doctor his own diagnosis, not omitting to mention that he can\u2019t imagine where the victim could have come upon the arsenic. And while the entire town, me included, are waiting for news of the victim, Flaubert allows Homais to continue his farce. He can\u2019t finish dinner with the famous doctor without a coffee from a very scientic-sounding machine, using coffee he has of course torrified and pulverised himself, and when he offers the famous doctor sugar for his coffee, he uses the scientific name: Saccharum, docteur?Soon Homais is back in the sickroom, using all his science to protect the dying woman from the priest\u2019s superstitions. But he doesn\u2019t succeed: Emma is encouraged to bestow on a crucifix the most loving kiss she\u2019s ever bestowed on a man\u2019s body. It\u2019s a wonder Flaubert didn\u2019t name her Marie Madeleine! And Flaubert isn\u2019t done with us yet. Homais and the priest sit by the deathbed arguing about religion until they both fall asleep, when they are shown to be indistinguishable from one another: two fat men nodding in their chairs, their chins resting on their chests. When they wake up, their differences re-emerge: one sprinkles the room with holy water, the other with chlorine and the story ends on that note. I really believe \u2018Madame Bovary\u2019 is a comedy. But Homais would no doubt prove me wrong. Using suitably scientific methods, he would prove that the majority of readers consider it a tragedy.

Last year, I had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Jane Eyre. With her modest dreams and dignified living, it was easy to accept and love her. She was far from perfect but there was hardly a thing I would have changed about her. A fictional character of literature exemplifying the virtuous side of real life but she was not alone. There were some other characters surrounding Jane who certainly struck a chord with me but the music thus created was not a soothing melody. The arrogant ways of Reed cousins and the vindictive streak in Bertha Mason\u2019s love symbolized an unpleasant world which held within it afflictive but relevant stories. In one such story this year, I met Emma. \n But shouldn\u2019t a man know everything, excel at a host of different activities, initiate you into the intensities of passion, the refinements of life, all its mysteries? Yet this man taught her nothing, knew nothing, wished for nothing. He thought she was happy; and she resented him for that settled calm, that ponderous serenity, that very happiness which she herself brought him. \n The Bored and Beautiful, Madame Bovary. We all probably know her. That naive little girl who doesn\u2019t appreciate the toy in her hands because another child owns an artificial but glittering tiara. That reckless young woman who jots down a list of inordinate whims which could culminate into a glorious Happily Ever After when time comes. That unfortunate mature lady who finally realizes the vacuity of her air castles when it\u2019s too late. Emma while single had imagination and anticipation; Ms. Bovary while married had perversity and passion. It was difficult to love and accept her but that\u2019s precisely what I did- with a little help from Flaubert\u2019s terrific writing and a little help from the world around me. Love and its vicious pleasures don\u2019t spare anyone. Those pleasures when turned inside out, sometimes take the shape of eternal sufferings too. The difference possibly lies in the vacuum created out of being in love and the idea of being in love. Both can be fatal but I would like to believe that the latter is something that is bound to make a person delusional about oneself and everyone around. Emma tried to form a derisory bridge from her idea too, in a hope to reach an unknown destination she usually read in her books but eventually she suffered too. Where could she have learned this depravity, so deep and so dissembled that it was almost incorporeal?Why, from this society only. A society which thrives upon displaying its pretentious happiness and insists on concealing the perpetual sadness. A society which constantly invent ways of piling up the debt upon another person while wearing the sham of welfare. A society where another Madame Bovary, Emma\u2019s mother-in-law, silently accepts her fateful marriage. Amidst all these lies, it\u2019s no wonder that Emma learned something which was not worth learning at all. Flaubert, through his omniscience narration hasn\u2019t passed any judgment or jumped to futile conclusions here. He has simply stated how people conduct their lives when materialism comes to the forefront of one\u2019s mind. Love goes to hell in such cases.  She was the beloved of every novel, the heroine of every drama, the vague she of every volume of poetry.Ah! The irony."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/386029-shannon", "userReview": "Why are all the \"great classics\" lead by famed female heroines all too often about personal freedom thru means of sexual compromise leading to abject misery and ultimate demise? I realize it's an accurate depiction of culture and times, however why are Bovary and Moll Flanders the memorable matriarchs of classic literature? See my commentary on the Awakening for similar frustrations. Why aren't there more works about strong women making a difference in their own lives if not those of their families and communities? Why aren't we having young women read a work or 2 portraying a strong female who doesn't end up having an affair, committing suicided, or otherwise screwing up her own life and the lives of others as she sinks to the bottom where she inevitably belonged? Where are the strong, sentient heroines who might make feminists look slightly intelligent and/or inspirational?"}, {"userName": "Perry", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6354112-perry", "userReview": "Splendid Sensations of Prose in Lydia Davis' Translation of Madame Bovary\n Most realize that the novel's basic substance or theme: an adulteress supreme and her poor cuckold hubby. Madame Bovary dreams of literary, romantic adventures with young studs and is one of the most self-centered persons in the Western canon. Yet, it could be that some who haven't read it have no idea of the \"ending\" ending (which I won't give away here). This is a masterful novel, and maybe one reason it's so affecting is because most of us know that we could have taken a bite of the luscious apple, that if we had made that one wrong turn in life and given in to sensual desire (however fleeting), we too would have carried ourselves and our loved ones hurtling down a road that leads always to tragedy for someone in our life. If you haven't read this, I recommend this translation, in which Lydia Davis' prose is sublime, e.g.:Love, she believed, had to come, suddenly, with a great clap of thunder and a lightning flash, a tempest from heaven that falls upon your life, like a devastation, scatters your ideals like leaves and hurls your very soul into the abyss. Little did she know that up on the roof of the house, the rain will form a pool if the gutters are blocked, and there she would have stayed feeling safe inside, until one day she suddenly discovered the crack right down the wall. The novel was ground-breaking in several ways, not the least of which is the well and range of human emotions that ebb and flow through the reader while marveling at Flaubert's astounding attention to detail. Clunky translations of this novel in the past took away from the experience of the sadness, anger, disgust, contempt and pity that this translation so aesthetically accentuates.I highly recommend this translation if you haven't read this."}, {"userName": "Huda Yahya", "userReviewDate": "Feb 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7878381-huda-yahya", "userReview":

world, young woman, who believes in the romantic novels she reads, moonlight walks, eerie, forbidding castles, dangerous flights into unknown, and strange lands, always trying to escape their frightening captors... brave, handsome men, that are faithful to their beautiful, virtuous women, fighting the evil, monstrous, corrupt, but attractive libertines , and the hero rescuing them in the nick of time...Emma lives on a farm, in mid nineteenth century France, her widower, remote, still gentle, father, Monsieur Rouault, anxious to get rid of his useless daughter, and though he enjoys the work, is not very good at it ( farming), but a considerably better businessman, being an only child, she wants excitement. Hating the monotonous country, dreaming about the titillating city, Paris , and the fabulous people and things there. Yet meeting and marrying the dull, common , hardworking, good doctor, Charles Bovary, who fixed her father's broken leg, he adores his pretty wife, life has to be better elsewhere, she thinks, so agreed to the marriage proposal. Moving to the small, tedious village of Tostes , Emma regrets soon her hasty marriage. Even the birth of her daughter, Berthe who she neglects, not a loving mother, the maid raises her, has no effect on her gloomy moods. She craves romance, her husband is not like the men in her books, ordinary looking, not fearless, or intelligent, words do not inspire coming out of his mouth, he lacks the intense feelings, she wants. After moving to another quiet village, Yonville (Ry) clueless Bovary, thinks the change of scenery, will lift his listless wife out of her funk. The local wealthy landowner, Rodolphe Boulanger, sees the pretty Emma, senses her unhappiness and seduces her, a veteran at this sort of thing, he has had many mistresses, in the past. At first the secret, quite perilous, thrilling, rendezvous behind the back of Emma's house, clandestine notes, reckless walks in the predawn mornings, to his Chateau, reminds Emma of her novels... but everything becomes routine, no better than married life. Rodolphe gets annoyed, unexcited, he also doesn't feel like the beginning, sends a letter breaking off the affair. The emotional Emma becomes very ill, her husband fears that she may die, puzzled at the sudden sickness. A slow recover ensues, Emma still has the same husband, starts another affair with a clerk, shy Leon Dupuis younger than she , more grateful too, not like the previous lover, the erratic Madame Bovary is in control. In the nearby town Rouen, in Normandy they meet every week, until this becomes uninteresting, the spendthrift woman, behind her trusting, loving, naive , husband's back, drive them to ruin, through her unreasonable buying sprees . Emma Bovary learns much too late, that the only person who loves her, is the unremarkable man she married. What can I say, love or hate this , it remains a controversial classic , the crowds flock to."}, {"userName": "Vessey", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/30910845-vessey", "userReview": "I dedicate this review to my dear friends Will, Jeffrey and Sidharth, whose wise words have always inspired meSPOILERS\n\"Did she not seem to be passing through life scarcely touching it, and to bear on her brow the vague impress of some divine destiny? She was so sad and so calm, at once so gentle and so reserved, that near her one felt oneself seized by an icy charm...But she was eaten up with desires, with rage, with hate. That dress with the narrow folds hid a distracted heart, of whose torment those chaste lips said nothing.\"\n If Emma Bovary had been born into another century, into our century, she could have been a great artist. It is arguable whether she has the talent, but she certainly has the soul. Her weakness could have been her strength in our times. Unfortunately, she lived in the XIX century society that didn\u2019t encourage her sensitiveness, her gentleness, her highly emotional and romantic nature. Instead, she lived in one that did not tolerate passion, assertiveness and freedom of spirit and mind in women. (Her father sees her as useless and instead of trying to help her grow, develop, he is only too quick to find her a husband, and this husband and his mother go as far as forbidding her to read novels) When we long to be understood, to be happy, to be connected, we also long to be seen. For someone else to see what we ourselves cannot or don\u2019t want to see. Sometimes we live on the edge of self-discovery and we only need a gentle push into the right direction. Emma waited, hopes to be saved, to be discovered, to be helped. Like all of us, she longes to be noticed and appreciated.\n\"At the bottom of her heart she was waiting for something to happen. Like shipwrecked sailors, she turned despairing eyes upon the solitude of her life, seeking afar off some white sail in the mists of the horizon. Each morning, as she awoke, she hoped it would come that day; she listened to every sound, sprang up with a start, wondered that it did not come; then at sunset, always more saddened, she longed for the morrow.\"\nHowever, all those rudiments that could have resulted into something wonderful, were molded into something destructive. She is too obsessed, too possessed by her desires. Her romantic nature dives her to harsh judgementalism, she is condemned and renounces everyone and everything that falls short of her idea of perfection. She is a woman incapable of seeing nuances. She is a woman of extremities. Even her feelings are such. Both her joys and disappointments are to the max.\n\"Accustomed to calm aspects of life, she turned to those of excitement. She loved the sea only for the sake of its storms, and the green fields only when broken up by ruins. She wanted to get some personal profit out of things, and she rejected as useless all that did not contribute to the immediate desires of her heart, being of a temperament more sentimental than artistic, looking for emotions, not landscapes.\"\nWould she have been happier had she found what she was looking for? And what does she for? A man with the imagination and passion her husband lacks and with the loyalty and trustworthiness her lovers fail to provide. One might argue that Charles offers her at least the latter. But I don\u2019t think so. Does he want her to be happy? Yes. Des he love her? Very much so. But love and connection aren\u2019t the same thing. She condemnd him for being so very far away from her ideal and he condemnes her by failing to be interested into the inner workings and struggles of her soul. He isn't even aware of them. He is a man satisfying himself with the ostensible. He isn't a man of deep thoughts and desires. This simplicity partially takes a good direction, because it results into a calm, amiable, trusting and optimistic nature, into a man needing a little to be happy. He is easily content. He is a man in denial. A man who needs a hurricane to wake him up. To me the two of them, while miles away from each other in other ways, are very much alike in their inability to see nuances. They are equally blind, equally self-absorbed. And they mutually destroy each other. \n\"Charles\u2019s conversation was commonplace as a street pavement, and every one\u2019s ideas trooped through it in their everyday garb, without exciting emotion, laughter, or thought. A man, on the contrary, should he not know everything, excel in manifold activities, initiate you into the energies of passion, the refinements of life, all mysteries? But this one taught nothing, knew nothing, wished nothing. He thought her happy; and she resented this easy calm, this serene heaviness, the very happiness she gave him...If he had but wished it, if he had guessed it, if his look had but once met her thought, it seemed to her that a sudden plenty would have gone out from her heart, as the fruit falls from a tree when shaken by a hand. But as the intimacy of their life became deeper, the greater became the gulf that separated her from him.\"\nThe same could be said for Rodolphe, who is too lost in his idea of women being weak, superficial and undeserving of his loyalty and affection. He falls in love with her, but fights with this love and his desire to give into it until the end.\n\"Because lips libertine and venal had murmured such words to him, he believed but little in the candour of hers; exaggerated speeches hiding mediocre affections must be discounted; as if the fulness of the soul did not sometimes overflow in the emptiest metaphors, since human speech is like a cracked tin kettle, on which we hammer out tunes to make bears dance when we long to move the stars.\"\nHe does not want to believe that Emma draws from a deeper well. Maybe too deep. Yet, would she have been happy had he stayed by her side, had he taken her away from her unhappy, lifeless marriage? I doubt it. \n\"She did not know if she regretted having yielded to him, or whether she did not wish, on the contrary, to enjoy him the more. The humiliation of feeling herself weak was turning to rancour, tempered by their voluptuous pleasures. It was not affection; it was like a continual seduction. He subjugated her; she almost feared him.\"\nWhen we are too fixated on some purpose, if we reject everything and everyone else that falls short from the image we carry within ourselves, even if we do achieve our dream, we wouldn\u2019t be able to appreciate the result. I have always believed that our ability to appreciate the grand things is build upon our ability to cherish the little ones. The two feed off each other. Is the ultimate goal the only goal? It is so for her. Only in the end, on her deathbed, she reveals a deeper, calmer, more compassionate, more conscientious side of her, which only shows that had she been given a chance, she could have been someone very, very different.\n\"So she had done, she thought, with all the treachery, and meanness, and numberless desires that had tortured her. She hated no one now; a twilight dimness was settling upon her thoughts, and, of all earthly noises, she heard none but the intermittent lamentations of this poor heart, sweet and distinct like the echo of a symphony dying away.\"\nWe breathe life into others through both our happiness and our sorrow. We are always open to the former, but seldom to the latter. I see this book as one illustrating what happens to women stuck into society that suppresses them, smothers them, that pushes them into a corner and leaves them there to rot. Another person\u2019s misery can be our own awakening. However, there are many who, like the characters in this novel, always choose to look the other way. And there are many who see human heart as something to step on and human misery as something to build upon. We all strive to build ourselves strong, but many believe that the best way to do so is by closing their hearts to human weakness and pain, including their own. But I believe that, just as if we don\u2019t possess the capacity to appreciate the little things, the imperfections, we cannot appreciate the extraordinary, if we don\u2019t let ourselves feel the pain, if we devoid ourselves of empathy, we deny ourselves happiness as well. My friend Will has told me more than once \u201cIt is important to let yourself feel the pain\u201d My friend Jeffrey has told me \"It is both weakness and strength' And my friend Sidharth has told me more than once, to be sensitive is to be vulnerable, but it is also to be alive. I believe that we are truly alive only when we have something/someone we would die for.Read count: 1"}, {"userName": "Renato Magalh\u00e3es Rocha", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29402621-renato-magalh-es-rocha", "userReview": "When I start reading a book named after one of its characters, I simply can't help the anxiety to meet them. In this case, I was impatient to finally get acquainted with Madame Bovary.Instead of that, on the opening chapter, we get to see Charles Bovary, the peaceful and shy little boy going to school for the first time. We accompany him while he grows up, study to become a 'doctor' and marry his first wife. After a series of events, he finds and marries his second wife - this time the one - and the story's protagonist finally takes center stage.Flaubert presents to us on his biggest achievement the story of Emma Bovary - the always sad, sorrowful and never quite fulfilled female Don Quixote (read my review)- who, through her reading of love stories in books and Parisian society's glamorous events on newspapers, hoped for a more exciting married life than what it seemed to be destined for her.Madame Bovary - who did not love her husband, or her daughter, or her home - was tragically in love with the possibility of a different scenario, and was willing to trade everything for being able to feel and go through breathtaking emotions. Beginning to grow unsatisfied and longing for a hero who would rescue her from her uneventful life, she ends up getting tangled up in a big web of lies, financial debts and cheating with not only one, but two lovers. The excitement of what seemed to be the real life she dreamed of ends up fading out, and finding herself even more lost and lonely than she felt before, she embarks on her ultimate escapade.Worthy mentioning - and an innovation at the time - is an impressively well crafted scene where Emma and her lover Rodolphe are alone, declaring bit by bit their love to each other for the first time, while, in the meantime, they can (and we can!) overhear the events happening outside on an Agricultural Fair at the village. We get to read, concurrently, the lover's declarations and M. Lieuvain's speech. This technique worked well for building up the readers' (at least this reader's!) enthusiasm and thrill felt when that long awaited moment where we would finally see Emma happy happened.The novel's impact was so huge that Gustave Flaubert was actually taken to trial for having written such an immoral book. Don't worry though: he was deservingly so acquitted of all charges. Its impact came not only because of the story itself, but also from the author's innovations and style: Madame Bovary - unlike most (maybe all?) novels from that time - totally lacks any personal commentaries or interventions from Flaubert; what we read is simply the report of the character's words and actions, leaving to us the task to try to make sense of their most inner feelings and actions. Rating: for Flaubert's literary innovations, his beautiful yet sad story and how it was skillfully constructed, 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Parthiban Sekar", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29910674-parthiban-sekar", "userReview": "Why was her life so inadequate? Why did everything she leaned on instantly crumble into dust? These were the questions tormenting Emma (Madame Bovary) in her solitude that she never expected to exist in her nuptial life of which she dreamed. Yet, the gaps widened. The barriers grew stronger.\"A man, at least is free; he can explore the whole range of the passions, go wherever he likes, overcome obstacles, savor the most exotic pleasures. But a woman is constantly thwarted. Inert and pliable, she is restricted by her physical weakness and her legal subjection. Her will, like the veil tied to her hat with a cord, quivers with every wind; there is always some desire urging her forward, always some convention holding her back.\"The solitude, she was forced to invent for her, had soon become unbearable. Is it the city life she was longing for? There are traces to positively acknowledge this question. But this is not the reason for the entirety of her distress. There must be something or someone she is really longing for.\"Don\u2019t you know there are some souls that are constantly tormented? They need dreams and action, one after the other, the purest passions, the most frenzied pleasures, and it leads them to throw themselves into all sorts of fantasies and follies.\"Was she a sacrifice to her marriage? A woman who had imposed such great sacrifices on herself certainly had a right to indulge in a few whims. She remembered the adulterous women from novels she read and their amorous adventures, imagining herself to be the heroine of her romantic adultery and victimizing herself to \"Women like that ought to be horsewhipped!\". But fantasies fooled her. Follies tormented her. Alas! Heroes left her, once they grew tired of her feminine refinements.\"Would this misery last forever? Was there no escape from it? And yet she was certainly just as good as all those other women whose lives were happy! She had seen duchesses at * who had dumpier figures and cruder manners than she, and she cursed God\u2019s injustice...\"Is she to be blamed for her distress? Are not those princely guys who entered her life, uninvited, and ravished her dreams, even distantly responsible for her self-torment? or Can we just call it as an ill-fate of a wretched soul? The author strictly prohibits you from drawing any conclusion or even making any inference from this story brimming with sad tears which touch the nuptial rings on the delicate fingers of the fragile beings. This is just the account of Madame Bovary. The ordeals of poor Monsieur Bovary are inexpressibly sad. Hence, better not expressed in words or emotions or any form. God save their daughter Berthe! Period!Movie - Warning:Please don't see the movie and underrate this excellent book. It is really disgusting how someone can badly mess up a story like this one. I just don't get it. You have a written script and why can't you make a movie as it is? or If you want to change the story totally or make it meaningless, why to use the title? Meh! I would happily call this movie as \"Confessions of a shopaholic - 2\" or something like that, given a chance. Notes on translationI didn't find any major difference between the translation of Geoffrey Wall (Penguin Classics) and Lydia Davis (Penguin Deluxe). However, Davis' translation is found to be easier to read and have better words at certain important places. But, when it comes to the question of paying more (Deluxe Editions are expensive. At least, here in my country, they are!) for a better widely acclaimed translation, I have to say that I am little disappointed.

something I should have noticed years ago. Rabbit Angstrom is Emma Bovary's literary grandson! As Moira says, Updike was deeply influenced by Nabokov, a fact that had somehow passed me by. Nabokov, in his turn, was a disciple of Flaubert; he famously said that he'd read all Flaubert, in the original French, by the time he was 14. So the family tree is clear enough.It's one of those cases, though, where things have sort of skipped a generation. It's not hard to see that the three authors are stylistically close. But Flaubert and Updike are both ultra-naturalistic and Nabokov is not, and Nabokov also has quite a different take on psychology compared to the other two. So you don't immediately link Updike to Flaubert, or at least I didn't; though I do remember, at least once, defending Rabbit by comparing him with Emma. It seemed somehow like a reasonable comparison, but I'd thought it was just a chance resemblance.Now that I have the missing link, it's all painfully obvious. The central characters in both stories are marked by early experiences which give them exaggerated hopes of what they can expect out of life; Rabbit is a high-school basketball star, and Emma attends the unfortunate ball at the ch\u00e2teau La Vaubyessard. After this, everything is a disappointment to them, and they find life with their respective partners, Janice and Charles, dull and stultifying. Their sense of frustration drives them into increasingly disastrous sexual liaisons, which eventually kill them and destroy several other lives as well.Flaubert makes no obvious attempt to judge Emma, which led to many of his contemporaries denouncing the book as wicked, immoral and even obscene, charges which are often applied to Updike for similar reasons; many American readers today dislike Rabbit as much as late nineteenth century French readers disliked Emma. To me, these criticisms are completely irrelevant to the question of whether or not Rabbit and Madame Bovary are great books. We see Emmas and Rabbits all around us; ignoring the novels is hardly going to make them go away. And the language is so delightful, especially Flaubert's. I'm in the middle of reading Madame Bovary for the third time. Emma has just met Rodolphe: he's put together a crude but effective seduction strategy, which he's already starting to implement. As usual, I'm willing her not to fall for him, but I don't think it's going to work out the way I want it to. Poor Emma._______________________________________________Finished. It's an almost perfect book, that you can read any number of times. Here are some of my favourite passages.The trashy novels that Emma reads when she's feeling depressed during the early years of her marriage:Ce n'\u00e9taient qu'amours, amants, amantes, dames pers\u00e9cut\u00e9es s'\u00e9vanouissant dans des pavillons solitaires, postillons qu'on tue \u00e0 tous les relais, chevaux qu'on cr\u00e8ve \u00e0 toutes les pages, for\u00eats sombres, troubles du coeur, serments, sanglots, larmes et baisers, nacelles au clair de lune, rossignols dans les bosquets, messieurs braves comme des lions, doux comme des agneaux, vertueux comme on ne l'est pas, toujours bien mis, et qui pleurent comme des urnes.MM. Bournisien and Homais watch over Emma's corpse, while squabbling with each other:Le pharmacien et le cur\u00e9 se replong\u00e8rent dans leurs occupations, non sans dormir de temps \u00e0 autre, ce dont ils s'accusaient r\u00e9ciproquement \u00e0 chaque r\u00e9veil nouveau. Alors M. Bournisien aspergeait la chambre d'eau b\u00e9nite et Homais jetait un peu de chlore par terre.Rodolphe finishes his break-up letter:-- Comment vais-je signer, maintenant? se dit-il. Votre tout d\u00e9vou\u00e9?... Non. Votre ami?... Oui, c'est cela.\u00abVotre ami.\u00bbIl relut sa lettre. Elle lui parut bonne.-- Pauvre petite femme! pensa-t-il avec attendrissement. Elle va me croire plus insensible qu'un roc; il e\u00fbt fallu quelques larmes l\u00e0-dessus; mais, moi, je ne peux pas pleurer; ce n'est pas ma faute. Alors, s'\u00e9tant vers\u00e9 de l'eau dans un verre, Rodolphe y trempa son doigt et il laissa tomber de haut une grosse goutte, qui fit une tache p\u00e2le sur l'encre; puis, cherchant \u00e0 cacheter la lettre, le cachet Amor nel cor se rencontra.-- Cela ne va gu\u00e8re \u00e0 la circonstance... Ah bah! n'importe!Apr\u00e8s quoi, il fuma trois pipes et s'alla coucher.And a little earlier, this, which I think is simply one of the most heartbreaking paragraphs ever written.Il s'\u00e9tait tant de fois entendu dire ces choses, qu'elles n'avaient pour lui rien d'original. Emma ressemblait \u00e0 toutes les ma\u00eetresses; et le charme de la nouveaut\u00e9, peu \u00e0 peu tombant comme un v\u00eatement, laissait voir \u00e0 nu l'\u00e9ternelle monotonie de la passion, qui a toujours les m\u00eames formes et le m\u00eame langage.

Madame Bovary is book #26 of the series.The story in a nutshell:Considered by nearly everyone to be one of the best novels ever written, French cynic Gustave Flaubert's 1857 Madame Bovary (originally published serially in 1856) is one of the first fiction projects in history to be as much a deep \"character study\" as a vehicle for simply propelling an exciting plot; it is an ultra-detailed look at an ultra-complex person, the Emma Bovary (nee Rouault) of the book's title, where the whole point is not just to learn what happens to her but what makes her tick in general. Because make no mistake, Bovary is one of the most complicated characters in the history of literature too, still able to ignite passionate arguments among fans to this day: some see her as a clearly sympathetic and very typical woman, forced into a whole series of awkward situations by a whole series of incompetent men in her life, just like such dunderheads have been doing to smart females for centuries; while others see her more like an unmedicated sufferer of bipolar disorder, constantly flip-flopping on what she wants out of life depending on what in particular she doesn't happen to have that particular moment, constantly adding unneeded drama to her life when bored and treating pretty much every single person around her like complete crap.Raised in a convent, a lover of erotica, desirous of an expensive urban lifestyle yet not very smart about money, it is this dichotomy of traits that keeps Bovary careening from one radically different situation to the next: first falling hard for her father's roving rural doctor (full-time \"good guy\" and hence impotent cuckold Charles Bovary), thinking that their marriage will finally bring her the sophisticated Paris life she's always dreamed of; then trying and failing at a domestic life as a small-town wife and mother, after it becomes clear that Charles prefers the dowdy provincial life of the northern French farmlands, leading to a hot-and-cold emotional affair with a young law student there named Leon; then a move to essentially one of the first large \"suburbs\" in France's history (the fictional mid-sized Yonville, not too far from Paris by carriage or rail, based on the real-life suburb of Ry), where she embarks on a much more serious affair with a major hater-playah named Rodolph; then an unceremonial dumping by Rodolph, after she offers to leave her husband for him and bring the kid along, leading to a short period again in her life as a pious born-again Christian; with all of that followed believe it or not by a reacquaintance with the now successful young urban lawyer Leon, leading to a sexually explicit \"hotel afternoons in the big city\" affair (the part of the book that led to its infamous obscenity trial when it first came out); which then finally leads to an ending whose details I'll leave a surprise, but let's just say results in ruin and/or death for nearly every freaking person involved. Oh, those French and their happy endings!The argument for it being a classic:Madame Bovary established so many firsts, its fans will argue, it's sometimes scary: not just the first novel ever to be written in the modern, pared-down \"conversational tone\" we know today, not just one of the first novels to complexly combine both character and plot development equally in one manuscript, but also one of the very first novels in history to establish the \"Realist\" school of thought, a set of conventions which now guide almost all contemporary novels being written (but more on that in a bit), all while ironically being a perfect example of a Victorian-Age Romantic novel as well, and of containing all the hallmarks that fans of Romanticism look for even while making vicious fun of them too. In fact, this book is almost like a freaky artifact from a future time that shouldn't actually exist, if you want to get technical about it; a book that reads exactly like a contemporary mainstream-lit character study, but published at the same time as the severely overwritten, overwrought, epistolary-style adventure tales and pseudo-science babble much more typical of the mid-1800s. It's not just important as a historical artifact (but more on that in a bit too), not just seminal to the arts in about a half-dozen different ways, but is still a surprisingly great read even 152 years later; nearly every novel being written today owes one aspect of its form or another to this ultra-important precedent, fans argue, making it the very definition of a literary \"classic\" that should still be picked up by every lover of great books out there.The argument against:Ironically, the only criticisms of Madame Bovary I could find seemed to argue that the book is just too well-written; that Flaubert created such a hyper-realistic emotional trainwreck, they ended up disgusted by her and couldn't even finish. \"Ugh, that Emma, I can't stand her, she's so despicable,\" I saw one online critique after another say, none of these people apparently realizing that that's the whole point; that the entire purpose of this book existing is to present this ultra-flawed, many times legitimately despicable character, to examine what motivates her and how she can be so sympathetic at times too, to understand ourselves better and especially those parts of our own personalities we share with her.My verdict:So how exactly should we feel about Emma Bovary, anyway? Well, to ponder that question is to avoid the much more remarkable point -- that Flaubert managed to create such a magnificently complicated creature to begin with, one who can still inspire such enflamed debates about her character a full century and a half later. (And by the way, how dispiriting to finally learn that Tom Perrotta's novel Little Children, which I highly favorably reviewed here in 2007, owes much of its success to a rather literal rip-off of many of Madame Bovary's key points, all the way down to sometimes stealing entire scenes beat-for-beat. Sheesh, no wonder Perrotta's follow-up The Abstinence Teacher was such a miserable stinker; he had no seminal semi-forgotten public-domain classic to lean on that time.) Not to mention, concentrating on Bovary's sometimes abhorrent behavior ignores a much more important point -- that every single character in this novel is abhorrent, done so by Flaubert very deliberately. Let's not forget, the book is set in the years of France's so-called \"July Monarchy,\" which in a simplified nutshell saw the creation for the first time in history of middle-class suburbanites; and like every other bitter artist in history, Flaubert despised middle-class suburbanites with every fiber of his being, and meant in many ways for Madame Bovary to be a devastating indictment of them all -- from the schizophrenic Emma to the facile Charles, from the jealous village pharmacist Homais to the weasely neighborhood merchant Lheureux. Let's always remember that Flaubert worked for decades on an epic called Bouvard and Pecuchet, which he always considered his perpetually-unfinished masterpiece; but that when it was finally released to the public posthumously in 1881, it turned out to be not much more than a massive unfocused rant, a grand satire concerning the utterly pathetic mediocrity of most human beings and the utter folly of ever thinking we will learn anything by studying history. Now that's a bitter French artist, my friend.But if this weren't enough, there's also the matter of the utterly remarkable language and structure used, which I now know for a personal fact because of doing this CCLaP 100 series is just so profoundly unlike any of the other novels that were being published at the same time; it really does feel like some freaky anomaly that shouldn't actually exist, snatched from the 1930s during the height of Early Modernism and somehow by time-machine accidentally left behind in the middle of the Victorian Age. (And even more remarkably, Flaubert himself wasn't particularly prolific or well-known, only finishing three other novels besides Bovary and all of them obscure even during his own lifetime.) This is why you hear so many people rave about this book's style, because it really is a perfect example of what the French call seeking le mot juste (\"just the right word\"); there are passages on display here that can instantly transport you in just a few paragraphs to a misty early evening in 19th-century northern rural France, before you even realize what's going on or that you'd left in the first place. And all of a sudden you've missed your bus, and you're standing on the streetcorner cursing Flaubert for being such an astounding writer in the first place.It's remarkable, I think, that this book lays the entire groundwork for the Realist school of literary thought, a full 50 years before Henry James and others even first came up with the English version of the term, and like I said nearly every mainstream-lit novel written today gets at least some of its cues from it; because much like the \"Socratic method,\" Realism has become so permeated in our culture that we don't even realize anymore that that's what it is when we see it, with the entire thing essentially boiling down to the idea of writing stories in a \"realistic\" fashion, as if we were invisible ghosts hovering over the shoulders of the characters and quietly observing the events of the story as they actually happen (now known as \"omniscient narration,\" and the basis behind 95 percent of all novels written). But it's also true what its fans say, that it doubles as a perfect Romantic novel too, a different school of literary thought with goals that sometimes clash with those of Realism; like the best of Victorian-Age literature, Madame Bovary too places great emphasis on emotions, feelings, passion, madness, and all the other great hallmarks of being an alive human being, and also like all great Victorian novels it too features as a character a buffoonish adherent of rationalism (in this case, the constantly pontificating pharmacist Homais), a holdover \"true believer\" from the 1700s Enlightenment who both the Romantics and Realists could agree on regarding their mutual hatred. (Stupid fun-hating scientists!)Although I'm only about a quarter of the way through the CCLaP 100 as of the writing of this particular review, I think it's safe to say that this is going to turn out to be one of my absolute favorites of the entire series, and it's simply astonishing in my opinion how well it's held up now over the last 150-odd years. It's a standard-bearer for sure of this entire series, one of only a handful of books in existence that nearly everyone agrees is a classic, which then helps us make the relative determination as well for much more troublesome candidates. If you're to read only a handful of books in the CCLaP 100 series, do make sure to make Madame Bovary one of them."}, {"userName": "Fabian", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1036893-fabian", "userReview": "The first reading of this novel does no justice to its original intended effect. The book must be reread especially if it was first encountered when the reader\u2019s life was still devoid of romance. Not until the second time around do the details linger, memorably, and the speedy plot that Part One promised is detained for the remaining Parts Two and Three which include photographically-intense colors and emotions felt (or, even not felt at all) by Emma Bovary. The plot is carefully-crafted; it is bookmarked by the lives of the secondary characters, as if Mme. Bovary is the (literal) center meanwhile her dilemma is a more private one: that lives go on before (the education and upbringing of the incompetent man that will be her husband) & after (the deaths of the members of the Bovary clan, the success of M. Homais) the actual core means that the world at large is indifferent to her & her tale is almost wholly forgotten, swallowed up. Here for the reader\u2019s consideration is a full life. Perhaps \u201crobust\u201d would not be a correct adjective to describe a life of desperation and woe. Emma Bovary is human because she is not all good nor all evil. She is materialistic but also idealistic. Wife and lover. Belonging nowhere, like a character born at the most inadequate of times. Like Oedipus with the Oracle, however, she is knowledgeable of the fate that is in store for adulteresses.The plot has plunges and heights, a spectrum that is available to anyone belonging to the human race. The pathos comes from all the chains Bovary must break to become free, and the further entanglement of her emotions complicate matters. Mme Bovary does not commit suicide with arsenic because of monetary problems. The title is perfect since it is itself a title: Madame Bovary. There are several Madame Bovarys in the book, including Charles\u2019s first wife and his mother. She is called Emma when she is free, when her identity becomes her own & she is dehumanized no longer, especially not by the sympathetic reader.Who can escape their position in society, their gender, their duties, their fate? Rodolphe tells Emma: \u201cif two poor souls should finally come together, everything is organized to prevent them from uniting. Still they try, they beat their wings, they call out to one another.\u201d It's this attempt which makes Madame Bovary a classic, modern tragedy where a soul is doomed because she feels everything, yet is only able to express the most minimal. Emma Bovary is in love with the notion of love, the conventions are her ideals, and she is nevertheless brave to at least try."}, {"userName": "Gautam", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32002534-gautam", "userReview": "\u201cBefore her marriage she had believed herself to be in love; but since the happiness which should have resulted from this love had not come to her, she felt that she must have been mistaken. And she tried to find out exactly what was meant in life by the words \u2018bliss,\u2019 \u2018passion\u2019 and \u2018rapture,\u2019 which had seemed so beautiful to her in books\u201dEmma Bovary constantly lived in a web of perpetual illusion, a luminous world which she had engendered through her penchant for reading vivid romantic books, and through her unremitting rumination upon her vague idea of ultimate bliss. Times she spent in the convent had added a holy, heavenly garb to her notion of being happy; the words like \"betrothed\", \"spouse\", \u201cheavenly lover\u201d and \u201ceternal lover\u201d uttered by the priests had made a deep impression on her, as if it was engraved on her heart by molten coal. The inordinate longing for this- vague- exalted bliss made her present reality riddled with ennui. Boredom was her singular trait; she always had a pensive air about her- a deep, hapless longing for \u2018Something\u2019. She spent each day in such wanton longing that the meeting with Charles was like a propitious coincidence, as if angels of bliss smilingly colluded into materializing this fortunate stroke of serendipity. She wouldn't know the least what to expect of this chance-meeting or what ultimate bliss feels like; she simply followed her infantile instincts and waited eagerly for the clinching of that \u2018eternal bliss\u2019, the desire for which inundated her ardent yet too stubborn heart with irrepressible longing. This excessive longing, at some point, is sure to be met with a cataclysmic disillusionment, like a streak of lightning is sure to be followed by a hollow peal of thunder- the crystal palace of her illusive world crumbles under the coarse, brutish force of reality that shatters the former with one powerful sweep. Slipping into a marriage with the conceited motive of attaining the \u2018bliss\u2019, with no inkling about the groom or his disposition, and relying solely on the heavenly collusion which she had had often read in her fiery romantic novels, Emma was about to receive the first blow, hefty still, on her egotistical self. A paragraph, which I highlighted as soon as I read it, shows her disposition in a generalized way:\u201dShe had to be able to extract some kind of personal benefit from things, and she rejected as useless anything which did not contribute to the immediate gratification of her heart, for her temperament was more sentimental than artistic and she sought emotion, not landscapes.\u201dAs soon as Emma got married, she scrabbled her nuptial life seeking to grope the \u2018exalted bliss\u2019 which she was sure of catching hold of. She reconnoitered her feelings and life post-marriage, like a hunter scouring the thickets of forest for his game. All she was able to comprehend was a tangible feeling of calmness, which rendered little to quell her ravenous thirst for the nebulous bliss. She, in her egotistical best, negated this serene calmness as it didn't look like the \u2018happiness\u2019 she wanted, which she so deliriously longed for. Her restless mind, palpitating in the disconsolate vibrations of her longings, couldn\u2019t settle in the cool shade of calmness, for which multitudes of souls fervently pray for each day. She aimlessly wandered on the stranded, even lands of marriage for \u2018something\u2019, like a delirious woman seeking an ocean in the midst of a desert. The \u2018something\u2019 which she longed for didn\u2019t obviously gave her a concrete picture as to what it is or how it may transpire a change in her life; but she knew that that \u2018something\u2019 should come in the garb of a man, a man who is her husband, the progenitor of her bliss. Charles, due to his inability to inspire in her that sort of exalted bliss, soon became an irritable thread in her eyes, making them water in anguish and despair. He, Charles, was an ordinary man with modest virtues and a golden heart. He loved Emma like an idol. He, being a common man, couldn\u2019t comprehend the tumultuous, convoluted heart of his partner, which was smoldering in demoniac rage at his failing to make her \u2018happy\u2019. All this sincere indifference and selfless devotion irritated her like lice on her hair.\u201cBut shouldn\u2019t a man know everything, excel in all sorts of activities, initiate you into the turbulence of passion, the refinements and mysteries of life?\u201d\u201cShe was exasperated by Charles\u2019s apparent unawareness of her ordeal. His conviction that he was making her happy seemed to her an idiotic insult, and his placid confidence about it struck her as ingratitude. For whom was she being virtuous? Was he not the obstacle to any kind of happiness, the cause of all her misery, the sharp-pointed tongue in the buckle of the strap that wound around her, binding her on all sides?\u201dEmma, who was beginning to see her husband as a bolus of hindrance in her ambitions and dreams, began furtively devising schemes to avenge herself for her lost bliss. Charles was scorned upon; he was too deplorable for her to even look at him with calm eyes. Her egotistical proclivities, her selfish quest for exalted bliss, all accrued to her slipping into the adulterous ways. She betook herself to this nerve-tickling idea of adultery with celerity. A new horizon of bliss loomed over her vision as she ruminated upon this exhilarating prospect with temerity. But the idea of bliss still remained recondite in her restless heart, but she wasted no time for any sort of introspection.\u201cThe drabness of her daily life made her dream of luxury, her husband\u2019s conjugal affection drove her to adulterous desires. She wished he would beat her so that she could feel more justified in hating him and taking vengeance on him.\u201dShe, in an amorous proclivity, began seeking adulterous love. In her search, two men caught her fancy : Leon and Rodolphe. The sensual pleasure was accentuated by her double pleasure of deceiving her husband. This vengeance soon paved way to an unusual bliss, and the trysts soon became a part of her being as she longed again and again to get drenched in those waters of passion and poetic bliss. She begins writing love poems for her lovers and becomes a lying machine in-order to get away with her mad desires. Conclusion: Everything has a breaking point, beyond which boredom and repentance takes the reign of the realm of your senses. Emma Bovary, finding at last that the amorous rope which she yanked so hard to her life was a slippery one, began descending into delirium and despair as she abruptly comprehended that her amorous expeditions has destroyed everything in its wake- destroyed her property, family and herself. At the death bed, in the serene and immaculate ambiance of dazzling candle lights and lulling prayers, the truth might have been dawned on her like one final revelation. But the truth of the truth is left by the author for our reasoning with conjectures that might resonate with our sense of judiciousness.\u201cWhy was life so unsatisfying? Why did everything she leaned on instantly crumble into dust? [\u2026] nothing was worth seeking \u2013 everything was a lie! Each smile hid a yawn of boredom, each joy a curse, each pleasure its own disgust; and the sweetest kisses only left on one\u2019s lips a hopeless longing for a higher ecstasy\u201d\nOh Emma\u2026\nWriting style:According to me, this is a sublimely written book. The prose laps onto our minds like the effervescent tides soothingly bathe our feet. His prose is so impeccable, so entrancing, so satiating that one gets on with a sweet soporific effect; there is a stuffy air of elegiac quality as well in his writing which again adds to the beauty.The details are not at all extraneous, and they add so much depth and beauty to the entirety of the novel. This is indubitably one of my favorite novels, and it thus entered into my top ten list. Highest possible recommendation. I cannot refrain from adding this wonderful passage:\u201cThe truth is that fullness of soul can sometimes overflow in utter vapidity of language, for none of us can ever express the exact measure of his needs or his thoughts or his sorrows; and human speech is like a cracked kettle on which we tap crude rhythms for bears to dance to, while we long to make music that will melt the stars.\u201d A brief note on translation:Lowell Bair had done a masterful job in bringing a musical finish to the overall translation. I thoroughly enjoyed this version and I wouldn\u2019t even try to look for other translations. I might as well read this translation again in distant future if a propitious time proffers itself to me.5 shining stars on 5!-gautam"}], "description": "Madame Bovary is the debut novel of French writer Gustave Flaubert, published in 1856.
