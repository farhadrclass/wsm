The first one, For Love of Money, was my least favorite because I found the story not that great and I didn't care for the characters. It was cute in the beginning, but the ending really spoiled the book for me...just didn't like it.The second novella, The Recipe, I loved! It was such a sweet story and didn't even feel like a novella. I loved how Aimee went on a \"journey\" to discover where she belonged and what her dream was. The ending was also very good!The last novella, Hook, Line, and Sinker, was a reread for me as I read it when it originally released. I really enjoyed it both times. The fishing contest was fun, as was the whole story. My only complaint is that the novella did feel a bit short, but still it was good.All in all, a nice novella collection. I enjoyed reading these quick stories and look forward to reading future novels by these authors.*Disclosure of Material Connection: I received one or more of the products or services mentioned above for free in the hope that I would mention/review it on my blog.

I'm a fan of novellas, and Chance of Loving You includes three of them.4 StarsI found the first story, For Love of Money by Terri Blackstock, to be pretty cute and humorous overall, from the minute Julie sits down from waitressing and dips into Blake's soup, since he isn't eating it anyway. Imagine being left half of a sweepstakes ticket for a tip. Julie's replaying of her doubts about Blake's motives do become repetitive after a while, and sometimes sudden, \"180 degree turn\" downturns in romances come off as rushed/forced conflict that therefore isn't altogether convincing, but the way to the resolution here is worthwhile.3 StarsHook, Line & Sinker by Susan May Warren, the last story, was somewhat difficult for me to get into, the storyline and character development seeming more disjointed than gradual to me, almost like starting a new book from the middle and feeling like you're missing the basis or weren't officially introduced to the characters. However, there are some sweet moments along Abigail and Ross's journey through several years'-worth of past grief and misunderstandings.5 StarsMy favorite story is the second, The Recipe by Candace Calvert, where Aimee and Lucas learn a lot about true love in action, and not only true romantic love. (I figure the inclusion of actual recipes after each story is in conjunction with Aimee's culinary aspirations.) The flow and pacing of the story is natural, and the lessons Aimee and Lucas learn come in powerfully, making for some beautiful turns of events.And, to this reader personally, the way God answers Aimee's prayer about her Bake-Off dilemma is so like Him. The Recipe is the strongest reason I have for recommending this novella collection to other readers of Christian romance._____________________Tyndale House provided me with a complimentary copy of this book for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Aerykah", "userReviewDate": "Nov 23, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5920961-aerykah", "userReview": "For Love of Money\n by Terri Blackstock-- 2 Stars.

On the surface, this sounds like a comic little tale- two groups of college students compete for the fishing contest jackpot. When you dive down deep into the characters' hearts, however, you'll find there's much more going on. Susan May has brought her classic emotional depth to this short novella. For me, this is the hallmark of her writing. I start off thinking \"Oh, cute story!\" And then next thing I know she's wrenching my heart around. Abby and Ross are both precious, in their own way. She's a New Testament Greek scholar, he's the class charmer. And you'll be delighted to get to know them, to see how much they mean to each other, to wish they would tell each other the truth, to laugh at all the fishing misadventures, and then to treasure the ending. Susan May always gets me, hook, line, and sinker. I read Candace Calvert's story next. \"The Recipe\" is the tale of Aimee Curran, a girl who has found her calling. Ever since her first \"apron time\" with her mom, Aimee has loved nourishing people. First in her own kitchen, then as a hospital dietary assistant, and now as a rising culinary star. A scholarship to culinary school is within reach- all she has to do is win a Vegan Valentine Bake Off. She did not need a mix-up at the hospital, that lands her at the bedside of an old lady who is refusing her food. How involved should Aimee become with this compelling patient? And with the lady's protective grandson? Will that budding friendship be a help or a hinderance to Aimee's dreams? \"The Recipe\" combines life's strongest flavors- loss, love, regret, and new hope. It all bakes into a tasty, come-back-for-seconds kind of read.And last but not least, Terri Blackstock's contribution. Terri crafts incredible suspense, and I wondered how she's do with the novella format. She has a winning premise, pardon the pun: How would you split a fortune with a complete stranger? And \"For Love of Money\" is full of twists and turns. It's a roller coaster ride of \"Yes, no, maybe- stop, go- left, right, slam on the brakes!\" And the two characters driving the story? Well, they've come unmoored. To continue the driving metaphor, I kept wishing someone would take their license away before they crashed us all. I had to keep reading to find out what happens, turning pages, following Blake and Julie through comedy and catastrophe.This tale will make you reconsider that ubiquitous wish of winning the lottery, and make you glad to have love instead of money. {Blake and Julie, at the end, could probably teach us a lesson or two in this area!} I thank Tyndale House for providing me with a review copy in exchange for an honest opinion. :-)"}, {"userName": "Rachel", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24104675-rachel", "userReview": "Chance of Loving You is an anthology by three bestselling romance authors including Terri Blackstock, Susan May Warren, & Candace Calvert.In the first novella, For Love of Money by Terri Blackstock, Blake Adcock's dreams have collapsed and all he's got to show for his dedicated hard work is a sweepstakes ticket. He has sat at the restaurant table for three hours, ordering things he doesn't want, because there is no place else he wants to go. Julie Sheffield, the struggling clothes designer who is waitressing on the side, is drawn to the man with the kind eyes... until he stiffs her on the tip by leaving her half of a sweepstakes ticket and no money.In the second novella, The Recipe by Candace Calvert, Aimee Curran is a hospital dietary assistant who is determined to win the Vegan Valentine Bake-off to prove that she's finally found her calling. CSI photographer, Lucas Marchal, religiously visits his elderly grandmother in the hospital trying to encourage her to eat and drink to get her well. While caring for Lucas' grandmother, Aimee and Lucas get to know each other and Aimee begins to question where she belongs. In the third novella, Hook, Line & Sinker by Susan May Warren, grad student Abigail Cushman is happy with her life as an Assistant Professor of Greek and Hebrew. Ross Springer is trying to prove his worth by raising money for the college group he mentors and leads. When Abigail and Ross end up competing in the annual Deep Haven fishing contest, they might just have a chance to put the past behind them and find the love they once had. Out of all three of these novellas, I liked The Recipe by Candace Calvert the best. Lucas and Aimee are drawn to one another and as they fall in love they end up helping the other at critical moments in the story. In For Love of Money, Blake's actions leave much to be desired, in my opinion. If he's so broke why is he sitting in an expensive restaurant ordering food he can't pay for? I like Julie's character a whole lot better. She stands by her beliefs and manages to change Blake's life for the better. In Hook, Line & Sinker, Abigail and Ross have known each other practically all their lives. You definitely get more depth to their relationship because of this. I like that they work on their differences and come to peace with the tragedy in their past.*Thanks to Tyndale House Publishers and Netgalley for the complimentary ARC copy of this book for review purposes.

I am a huge fan of all of their writings individually, so when I found out they were teaming up to write a book together with common themes, I couldn\u2019t wait to get my hand on a copy. This sweet anthology features three couples who run into each other: one after many years and the other two were first encounters. The idea of three couples falling in love after meeting seemed like a good idea. Happens all the time. The story by Candace Calvert, \u201cThe Recipe\u201d was my favorite story. I truly enjoyed how Lucas and Aimee had a connection with strawberries. Lucas\u2019s grandmother used to paint strawberries while Lucas was fascinated his grandparents\u2019 love story and has been recording it through photography for years. Aimee, however, has enjoyed how her mother used to make this Strawberry Rhubarb Crumble for her birthday. The nursery home story world created a nice feeling to grab the affection and interest of Lucas and Aimee. I enjoyed watching the transformation of Aimee and Lucas by the story\u2019s end. While \u201cThe Recipe\u201d was my most favorite novella of the collection, \u201cThe Love of Money\u201d by Terri Blackstock seemed unrealistic. Blackstock is known for her romantic suspense, so I think she should stick to that. \u201cThe Love of Money\u201d has Julie and Blake winning twenty thousand dollars and deciding how much it can change them. I had a hard time swallowing the concept behind the story. Plus, the romance between Julie and Blake was too fast for my taste. I don\u2019t even think Julie and Blake really like each other. The money tied them together. I read \u201cHook, Line, and Sinker\u201d before. It has way too much fish terminology that I forget that I\u2019m reading a contemporary romance novel in the process. Being a huge fan of Susan May Warren, this is a short novella that I would have a hard time recommending to my friends.

If you are looking for fun and sweet love stories, this may be a good match for you.Although all three are novellas, I felt like I got to know the characters in each novella fairly well. None of the stories felt rushed to me and all three had sweet, happy endings. I did not really connect well with the two main characters from For Love of Money by Terri Blackstock. It was well-written and an interesting storyline, but Blake Adcock got on my last nerve. My frustration with Blake just got worse as the story continued and I didn\u2019t really want him to end up with Julie! So, although many others will probably enjoy this story, I just did not. I will add, though that this novella had quite a few humorous moments.I did like the two other novellas. The Recipe by Candace Calvert was a very emotional and heartfelt story. I thought that the two main characters, Aimee and Lucas, had great chemistry. Their journey together and the individual growth that each experienced in the book was heartwarming and I did not want to see their novella come to an end.I also enjoyed Hook, Line & Sinker by Susan May Warren. Abigail and Ross had some big hurts to work through. Tragedy pulled them apart and, to be honest, when I learned their backstory, I was a bit surprised at exactly how things had gone wrong. One conversation could have cleared up the confusion and saved some additional heartache!

I really loved this collection as a whole, it was a great read which I highly recommend. For Love of Money by Terri BlackstockThis was the second story of Ms. Blackstock's that I've read, and I really enjoyed it though I do think it was my least favorite of the three novellas in this collection. This novella begs the question we all have probably wondered about at times, if we won the lottery what would happen? Would the money change us? What would be most important to us? I loved the conclusions that Julie and Blake came to. I also really liked Julie's modest clothing line, I totally wanted to buy some of the clothes she designed.The Recipe by Candace CalvertI loved this novella! It was really good. Each of these novellas has a recipe at the end of it and I love that the recipe at the end of this one plays a large role in the story! This story contained all the aspects I love in a story!

I didn't feel drawn to the characters but it was fun seeing how they responded to each other and their unexpected and overwhelming wealth. Their interactions are impetuous and dramatic, and it played like a made-for-tv movie in my mind.\"The Recipe\" by Candace Calvert - 4 starsSet in San Diego (yay!), this one hit closer to home since my mother is an advocate for caregivers and the elderly. Lucas and Aimee bond over his grandmother's care and provide emotional support for each other. Aimee's love of cooking stems from the time she spent with her late mother making meals for others. I enjoyed the themes of compassion, grief, hope, and acceptance as Lucas and Aimee both come to terms with their struggles. Great romantic moments!\"Hook, Line & Sinker\" by Susan May Warren - 5 starsUnlike the two previous, the couple featured in this story has a romantic history. There is a great intro scene involving a dunk tank, but then the grief and misunderstanding that came between Abby and Ross brings a boatload of emotion and angst to the narrative. Their past is revealed to the reader in bits and pieces while the present day takes place at Deep Haven's lake fishing contest.

Hook, Line and Sinker. I\u2019m a huge Susan May Warren fan but I was not a fan of this story. It was a novella that I couldn\u2019t relate to; maybe because this author does an incredible job of having us get to know her characters, (which takes a few pages) and the community they live in (again takes more pages). Then the author usually has the reader delve into the problem. (again takes more pages) I was expecting more from this author because I\u2019ve read other wonderful books by her.

I happen to love all three of these wonderful authors, so I was super excited to see a collaborative anthology featuring them. I was also totally drawn in by the beautiful cover - it just looked magical, so I had high hopes for the book. The first thing I noticed when picking up the book is that two out of the three stories aren't new, they're just repackaged. For Love Of Money by Terri Blackstock was originally published in 2000 in an anthology titled Sweet Delights, and Hook, Line, & Sinker is part of Susan May Warren's Deep Haven series and was published as an ebook novella as book 4.5 in that series in 2011. The only brand new offering is Candace Calvert's The Recipe.

Each short story can be read in an hour or two apiece, and they're entertaining yet lighthearted. For The Love Of Money was the longest piece in this anthology, and it was a fun yet condensed love story. Personally, I enjoyed The Recipe the best out of the three stories. I was able to connect with the characters much more in The Recipe than in For The Love Of Money. And I definitely enjoyed Hook, Line, & Sinker because I love Susan May Warren and her Deep Haven series - although this short little novella does well as a stand-alone as well. I think I may have enjoyed it better because I know the Deep Haven characters, but I feel like anyone might be able to pick it up and not feel lost. What I liked best about each of the stories is how well they fit the theme - each story was about someone who gave up what they thought was their \"ultimate dream\" to discover they gained something much better - love. While these aren't earth shattering, deep, life changing stories, they are sweet and fun and great to pass the afternoon at the beach or to bring along for a relaxing bubble bath. 3.5 out of 5 stars.I received a copy of this book from Tyndale in exchange for an honest review.

It was called \"It could happen to you\". I only know the name of it because I had to look it up. I found this story was an Okay read. I did enjoy the Christian theme to it and the struggle that the sudden windfall of money caused both Julie and Blake. I liked both of the MC's although some of Blake's levity and what looked like carelessness with the money sometimes bothered me. Hey, just showing human nature I think. I can say that I did like the ending of the story. Book 2- The Recipe- This one was a favorite for me. I liked Aimee she was kind of a misfit but so kindhearted and likable. She was trying to find her place in life; her gifts and talaents. She was almost starting to wonder if she had any. The other main character, Lucas loved his grandmother so much and her story was also something different. What a sweet, charming story it turned out to be.Book 3- Hook Line & Sinker- Abigail and Ross had a long history; they have known each other for years. And not all of their history is good. It used to be but grief, insecurities and misunderstandings have done some severe damage. How can these two make their way back to each other? Abby stayed true to herself but Ross was trying to be someone and something else than who he really was; trying to fill the void that was left by his older brother Scotty's death. Each one of the stories had a recipe at the end of their stories. Each one had a good moral to the story without being super preachy; I did like that. Scripture and Christian backgrounds are a part of their stories too. Each also has a Happy Ever After ending. I would say that its a pleasant read over all.

I feel it will be easier to review each story individually, than try to review the book as a whole. All things considered, the Candace Calvert story clearly carried the other two entries into a 3 star rating.For Love of Money by Terri BlackstockThis story reminded me very heavily of the movie It Could Happen To You, and not in a good way. Blake seemed very reckless with his newfound winnings and Julie was a complete shrew about the whole thing. The falling in love declarations were not believable in the slightest, and the faith aspect felt awkward and unwieldy. The whole book had a \u201ctrying too hard\u201d vibe to it, making it feel very fake and a bit rushed. It was mildly entertaining, so I\u2019m rating it 2.5 stars.The Recipe by Candace CalvertI didn\u2019t realize it at the time, but this book fits right into the Crisis Team Series, which was a pleasant surprise! The story was very nicely done, I started really beginning to care for the characters and wanting to see more of what happened to them! Aimee was very realistic as a character, and I liked how the author didn\u2019t go into a lot of detail about Lucas\u2019 job, as her expertise in a hospital setting shines through very clearly in this story. The supporting characters felt just as important as the main ones, and lent authenticity to the story. All in all, a very enjoyable story I will re-read when reading the series! (4 Stars)Hook, Line & Sinker by Susan May Warren This story is part of the author\u2019s Deep Haven series, apparently midway through the series, but I wasn't lost at all. There wasn't much world building done, but the series also wasn't referenced heavily, making this story a good introduction to the author's writing style. However, the characters really weren't realistic to me. What couple wouldn't sit down and communicate with each other when one of them has been grieving? Why did this couple drift apart after the death of Scotty? It made no sense for me. The ministry part of the story seemed contrived and overly competitive, when it really shouldn't have been. I found my interest flagging quite a bit on this story, so thankfully it was short. I think I might check the author's other works out from the safety of the library and not spend my money on something so uncertain.

However if you are already a fan then these short stories are a way to prevent withdrawal until their individual next novel come out. Each story is different and great fun all by itself. \u201cChance Of Loving You\u201d is great fun to read. This is a book where you wrap yourself in a cozy blanket, make yourself comfortable in your favorite chair and have warm cider to drink as you savor each story. All the stories are so well written and the romance is perfect, tender not overboard or forced. Hopefully there will be another and make this a series.

She was not one to go out and spend just because she suddenly had the money to do so\u2014perhaps she held it too close. Blake came across as a spend-thrift but in the end he and Julie's focus was not on the money but on how to help others after pursuing God's guidance. The contrast between before and after obtaining a large sum of money can be seen in the actions of the two main characters. I liked Blake and Julie when they first met and towards the end of the story, the middle was a bit off.-The Recipe***** by Candace CalvertI love the way Lucas Marchal loved and cared for his sweet grandmother. His grandmother, Rosalynn, while she was in the hospital. Hospital dietary assistant, Aimee Curran, \u201clivens up\u201d the patients' meals with some artistic food garnishes with some surprising results. She has also entered into a Vegan Valentine Bake Off and decides to adapt one of her mother's recipes for the next round. Lucas, Aimee and Rosalynn are my favorite characters\u2014must not forget Margie. Everything about the story and the characters flowed well making this a sweet, heartwarming story. This is my favorite of the three novellas in this book.-Hook, Line and Sinker**** by Susan May WarrenIt seems that Ross Springer and Abby Cushman have a past history of sorts which comes across as they interact in this cute story. I'm thinking they should have talked long before the contest and they could have avoided some heartache. The past always impacts the present and future as these two learned.

The first book is by Terry Blackstock called For Love of Money. It's a lottery winner story with a Christian perspective. It makes you wonder how you would handle the situation; would you be more like Blake or more like Julie. I think your stomach will be in notes as you watch the clock tick down \uf04a The second book is called The Recipe by Candace Calvert. The book starts off with a little humor and moves into more serious topics. Lucas\u2019 grandmother is in the hospital and is losing her will to live after recently losing her husband. Aimee works in the nursing home in the food area. Aimee is also entering a food contest and trying a few options out on the residents. There is a lot of reflection regarding her loss of her mother. I think you're truly enjoy the story. I teared up twice; once when we find \"The Recipe\" and again when Lucas gives Aimee her birthday present. The third and final book is Hook, Line and Sinker by Susan May Warren. Each of the stories has a totally different feel and setting. In Hook, Line and Sinker you have two friends trying to move past their grief that tore them apart. I think you will love Abigail who is your smart quirky 4.0 grad student. Ross is the brother of her high school best friend and the boys she's had a crush on since high school. He is her total opposite full of charisma and struggling to pass Greek. The story takes place as they're competing in an annual fishing contest.You can see my full review at More Than a Review dot com where I rate the level of sex, violence, language and drug/alcohol use in books."}, {"userName": "Madison", "userReviewDate": "Feb 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6951127-madison", "userReview": "This anthology is a great way to become introduced to three very talented writers, or for fans to enjoy a small sample from each.In Terri Blackstock's novella Julie and Blake could never have imaged the road their lives would take when Blake leaves Julie half a sweepstake ticket as a tip. This story was crazy. Crazy and hilarious. One minute getting along, the next yelling at each other, Julie and Blake are thrown together, but they will have to determine if they are meant to be together or if money will get in their way.Candace Calvert's novella takes readers to San Diego Hope Hospital where dietary assistant Aimee assembles hospital food trays and dreams of a life of fine cuisine and masterful cooking. But when her dreaming (and garnishing) lands her in trouble, Aimee finds herself assisting ailing patient Mrs Marchal, and rather attracted to Mrs Marchal's son, Lucas. I love Candace's writing - the setting, tone and characters. This is a great short story, so characteristic of Candace's writing.I had previously read Susan May Warren's novella Hook, Line and Sinker, but was very happy to read it again. I love anything and everything she writes. Abigail lost both the Springer brothers the day Scotty died. Now Abigail has a chance to win back her rights as a leader of the evangelic youth group, and maybe one last chance to show Ross Springer that he was always the brother for her. Bring on the fishing.

This book has a great plot that really asks us if money can buy happiness.The Recipe by Candace Calvert The recipe has some great scenes that I found really entertaining, and the contrasting personalities between Aimee and Lucas were wonderful.

For Love of Money by Terri Blackstock is a fun story similar to the movie It Could Happen To You, where a man leaves a lottery ticket for a waitress and she wins, then they proceed to fall in love. This one was a little different in that they had just met that night and Blake left it because he had no tip to leave Julie. He also ripped it in half and when he realizes they won and finds her again, she's not interested due to his desperation and greed when she can't remember what she did with it. They both could definitely use the money since they each are struggling to build new businesses. She wonders if all he cares about is the money. She'd been burned before and thought every man had an ulterior motive. He didn't know what he could do to prove his love. I had actually read this story years ago when it was in the Sweet Delights anthology and I liked it just as well now as then. Blake has some really funny one-liners and he's more impulsive where Julie is a nice complement of being more conservative and practical. There's some discussion of their faith in God and how they'd been forgiven great debts and so forgive others for lesser things and they also pray to discover God's will. This was a fun, unique story with some sweet romantic moments.The Recipe by Candace Calvert was an interesting mix of hospital setting with aspiring chef. Aimee works in the hospital kitchen, but wants to win a vegan baking contest so she can attend culinary school. She meets Lucas there as his grandmother's health is failing and she's ready to die. He, however, is doing all he can to change her mind and get her to want to live and to eat more to get her strength up. Aimee ends up helping to feed his grandmother for a couple weeks and, though they get off to a rocky start, start to confide in each other about their struggles. Aimee can relate because she lost her mom to cancer 10 years ago and knows what it feels like to be helpless. She determines to help him all she can and starts to question what she really wants to do with her planned degree. I really liked the unique elements of the vegan recipes and trying to create something yummy with unusual ingredients. It was a little sad as Lucas's grandmother isn't doing well and Aimee still grieves over her mother. There's a little bit of talk of faith as the main characters all seem to be believers. The grandmother's developmentally disabled roommate was amusing as she pretty much said what she was thinking and often embarrassed others. There were some cute romantic moments in this story, too.Hook, Line and Sinker is a very cute, short romance in the Deep Haven series. Ross Springer and Abigail Cushman are the leaders of different youth groups at Bethel College in Minnesota and decide to enter a fishing contest to raise money. Never mind that Abby has no idea how to fish. They're also trying to forget what they once were to each other. He also had feelings for Abby but believed that she never really cared for him that way. When his brother died, he felt like he needed to fill his shoes, but doesn't think he could ever measure up. Is is too late for them or will love win in the end? For such a short story, Susan does a wonderful job of creating well-rounded, real characters. There are sweet and amusing moments and real depth to the character's struggles. I also liked how they both were trying to figure out what God wanted them to do with their lives. I had also read this a couple years ago as it was previously available only as an e-book. This is easily read as a stand-alone, but reacquaints you with some characters from her other books. This is a great anthology you won't want to miss!

What happens when you go from rags to riches instantly? This takes a look at that event. Julie is very prudent with her spending and I loved that. I\u2019m a saver like she is. Eventually, she has a revelation that caught me by surprise. I really related to her and understood her reluctance to pursue a romance with Blake when she barely knows him. Blake was a little more free-spirited. He loved spending the money on others and seeing their joy. While I understand that joy of giving, it\u2019s not the thrill for me that it is for him. I felt his joy and his sincere belief that God was directing his steps. But, I understood Julie\u2019s concerns that he was after her half of the money.Overall, it was a fun read that went really fast. But, I loved the thought-provoking moments that kept me thinking about it for days.The Recipe by Candace CalvertAimee really touched my heart. She\u2019s floundered a bit after her mother\u2019s death. She\u2019s now on track and ready to compete to win a full ride to culinary school. She works at the hospital with tray prep, but she can\u2019t wait to get to culinary school. She can be a bit impulsive, but her heart is in the right place.

After seeing how she goes above and beyond, he starts to warm to her style. I loved how they took time to get to know each other. It was very sweet. They both had some similar background life events and could understand each other.I truly enjoyed watching their romance blossom and the ending was a total surprise to me. This was a very lovely novella. Hook, Line & Sinker by Susan May WarrenAbigail is a woman who knows exactly where her life is headed. Graduating with her PhD in Greek Studies, she\u2019s already landed a job at the university and plans to continue the ministry she started. So when she hears of a way to earn $5,000 that their Sojourner ministry could use to purchase and send Bibles to developing countries, she\u2019s all in. Always a thinker, she hits the books and takes a crash course in fishing. She knows it will be close quarters with Ross\u2014her never-quite boyfriend and now firmly no-friend. But, she\u2019s willing to do it in order to win the prize. Ross knows he has almost cost New Life their entire ministry. A well-received ski trip didn\u2019t financially fare well and has almost bankrupt the ministry. He\u2019s desperate to be like his deceased big brother, Scotty. He wants to leave a legacy\u2014and not one of killing a ministry. So he devises a fishing trip competition with a $5,000 purse. If he can win the purse for New Life, they will be back in the black for years. Even if he flunks out of college as a senior, he will still leave a legacy. He wishes he could share his concerns with his former friend, Abby, but since his brother Scotty died, it\u2019s become painfully clear that she loved Scotty and will never see Ross as more than a little brother. So he\u2019s going to flunk his senior year over one course, not graduate, and not get the one and only girl he\u2019s ever loved.While I love Susan May Warren\u2019s writing, this story is not my favorite from her. I love, love, loved the ending when the competition was over. The life lessons were spot on. But the story itself seemed a bit contrived and it was hard to believe this animosity had gone on for two years. But, putting that aside, I really did like reading about Abigail & Ross and seeing their story unfold. -- ROBYN"}], "description": "An anthology by three bestselling romance authorsFor Love of Money by Terri Blackstock Trying to launch her own design firm while waitressing on the side, Julie Sheffield was drawn to the kind man she waited on at the restaurant last night . . . until he stiffed her on the tip by leaving her half of a sweepstakes ticket.The Recipe by Candace Calvert Hospital dietary assistant Aimee Curran is determined to win the Vegan Valentine Bake-Off to prove she\u2019s finally found her calling.
