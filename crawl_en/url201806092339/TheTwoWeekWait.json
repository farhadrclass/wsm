The subject is a moving one although I did find it a little hard to connect with Lou's near instant decision to have a child, especially when compared to the more considered desire of Cath. Considering the speed with which Lou seems to come to this decision it did seem somewhat cruel to the characters and the readers that the author decided to only grant success to one woman in this story. There seemed to be several sharp criticisms of single parents running through this book, which I do not feel were entirely necessary, especially not if one remembers the central story of 'one moment'. The title of this book is also a little misleading, the actual two week wait is skipped through remarkably quickly, and even the most traumatic and joyful scenes of the story seem to be given only a short moment within the novel, it does read a little as though the author ran out of steam around the conception stage of the story which is unfortunate. Overall this has the potential to be a very moving story, but ultimately I didn't feel that it held together as well as I would have liked."}, {"userName": "Jeanet", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4766722-jeanet", "userReview": "Heartbreaking and life affirming. Two words I used to describe Rayner's first book about the Brighton based women Lou, Karen and Anna 'One Moment, One Morning' and they could easily be used again for the review of 'The Two Week Wait'. Sarah Rayner once more reminds us that ordinary lives are filled with extraordinary events and once we are able to connect the dots an amazing story is unfolding right before us. I love her no fuss way of telling a story. Written in present tense the events of the books seems to be happening around you - and the story is filled with characters that feels as real as were they truly a part of your everyday. The women of the book don't live perfect lives - and they certainly don't make perfect decisions - and the story is sad and joyous - terrible and perfect - it is filled with life as we all know it and love it."}, {"userName": "Chris Chalmers", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7268416-chris-chalmers", "userReview": "I've read two of this lady's previous novels and loved them both.. This is a kind of sequel to the excellent One Moment, One Morning, though previous knowledge is not required to reap the full benefit of this moving and pacey tale. Her research on the subject of IVF is meticulous though worn lightly, and it's guaranteed to strike a chord with anyone who's been through a similar experience. After One and Two, you do wonder if a Third novel is in the offing - there's plenty of mileage left in Sarah Rayner's thoroughly engaging characters, and I'd love to hear what happens next!

This book took me by pleasant surprise! When I first started to read it, I wasn\u2019t too sure about this book. The topic can be a sensitive one ( infertility), and some of the avenues pursued can be difficult.

Lou makes a visit to the doctor after finding a lump in her tummy. The doctors treat her fibroids and suggest that if she ever wants kids, to do so a.s.a.p. Lou\u2019s partner, Sofia, is not ready to take on that responsibility and they end their relationship on friendly (but painful) terms. Lou is not a wealthy woman and the treatments are pretty expensive. She is approved for a program in which she is able to undergo the treatment for free if she agrees to donate some of her eggs to another person seeking to have a child.Cath, who has undergone chemo and has had her ovaries removed, is the recipient of Lou\u2019s eggs. Her husband Rich is very supportive and realizes that he wants to have a baby just as much as Cath does. Their stories of love, hope, anger, determination, and acceptance are woven together and told with such tenderness. However, the emotions that are stirred up in this fine read are not sappy or over the top. The very end, in which one of the ladies sends the other a note via their doctor, made my eyes well up (and I am not an \u201cemotional\u201d person). I received this ARC through Goodread\u2019s First Reads and recently discovered that The Two Week Wait is a sequel to One Moment, One Morning. I\u2019ve never read Raynar\u2019s work, but I will now. I am definitely going to get the prequel and hope there is a sequel to the Two Week Wait in the works."}, {"userName": "Patrice Hoffman", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5405898-patrice-hoffman", "userReview": "*Won Through a Goodreads Giveaway*At times I find my self wanting to binge on women's fiction and this novel in particular fit that bill. The story centers around two women who have found that their biological clocks are ticking or have already run out of time. After surviving a health scare, Lou's doctors tell her that if she wants to have children, the time is now. Cath, having dealt with cancer, was unable to have children of her own. These women don't know each other except through anonymity. They both decide IVF is the way to go in order to satisfy their want of having a child.The two week wait (2WW) is the period between having the embryos... um... put in and the proof of it's success... or at least a pregnancy test that says at that moment you're a pregnant lady. It was interesting reading what the women go through in order to stay sane during that waiting period. Sarah Rayner does a great job at explaining the process to the reader in a way that isn't like reading a medical document. She weaves it into the story instead of boring the reader to death with procedures and technical terms.This book also throws in the necessary anti- in vitro argument as well. But one person who was against it was painted as the most vile person ever. I usually have problems with cliched characters, but I think a lot of this book was too unrelatable. Or at least to me. I feel that no matter what, if a woman wants to be a mother, she will do whatever she can to become a mother. By that I mean adoption, IVF, or surrogacy. These women both kinda fell into wanting a child easily without much consideration of what they would do if IVF didn't work. It made their want, not need, of having a child seem too unreal. Although the premise of this book was pretty interesting, the characters weren't. I didn't feel any connection to these women. I was more connected to the women in their chat room than I was to them. I also felt more of a connection to the process of IVF than to either woman. Maybe that was the point Rayner was getting at. Overall, this book was a great quick read for lover's of women's lit'. It does not disappoint on the women's issues front. I look forward to adding her other works into my future women's literature binges."}, {"userName": "Danderma", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8604247-danderma", "userReview": "The first book I read by Sarah Rayner, One Moment One Morning, was very good. It was sad but it had a certain type of story that people can identify with. The ending was good and provided a kinda happily ever after ending. When I was last in the UK I looked for more books by Sarah Rayner, only to find that she had written a second book, kinda like a sequel, to the first one. The second book was called \u201cThe Two Weeks Wait\u201d and of course I grabbed it and it made the top of my books to read list, which is getting quite lengthy btw.I came back from the UK in March. I started reading the book right away. We are near the end of May\u2026 and I still haven\u2019t finished the book. I've started and finished several books in between. I give up. I tried. I usually force myself to read so and so books in hope they get better in the end, maybe a different twist? But by doing so I would be hiding from a very obvious reality: Even if the ending was good, the book is boring! BORING! I can\u2019t read it. I cannot engage in it. It tells the story about how someone who now suddenly decides to have a baby after a uterus illness scare and she is running out of time and in the same time trying to give her eggs to another couple where the woman just got out of cancer which killed off her ovaries but her uterus is still OK.First off, I totally cannot relate to it. The situation of sharing eggs and finding donors and what\u2019s not is an alien world to me. Secondly, what happened to the story line from the first book? Its all but diminished. If any of the old characters do appear they are totally dull and now we have to be introduced to the other couple too. It could have been more interesting, but It wasn\u2019t.Therefore, I am putting it down. I give up. Two months trying to force myself to read through the pages of the same book? I began flipping through the pages in the end. That\u2019s it. The first book wasn\u2019t the best book of the century but it was a pretty good one, quite interesting and everyone can identify with it. The second however is meh and the best thing about it is that it had a pretty cover."}, {"userName": "Shelagh Rice", "userReviewDate": "Feb 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20709970-shelagh-rice", "userReview": "A good solid follow up to One Moment One Morning, though you could read it without having read the first one. This follows the lives of four women and their children and the struggle some have with fertility issues. It follows two of them through the highs, lows and heartbreak of IVF. I liked the way the author used a forum the women use to educate the reader on the facts of IVF without feeling you were reading a medical paper. The story kept me engaged and I learnt at lot about a subject I thought I knew about. It is not a deep dark read, the author manages to make you care but does not overwhelm. Another solid 3 star."}, {"userName": "ALEXA", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4988733-alexa", "userReview": "Reviewed on Alexa Loves Books.Ever since I was a little girl, I always knew I wanted to be a mother and raise a family. I thought the process was straightforward enough, but as I got older, I realized it was possible for many complications to get in the way - infertility, a lack of a partner, medical conditions just being some of the few I can name. The Two Week Wait is a beautifully written tale. Sarah Rayner takes us through the twists and turns with remarkable skill and just the right touch of emotion.The CharactersI very much admire Lou's character. Throughout the novel, she demonstrates a whole lot of patience, bravery, kindness, and love. She was stubborn enough to stick to her guns when it came to having a child, and wise enough to recognize the wisdom of going after what she wanted, even if caused a few ripples in her life. This straightforward doggedness in going after what she wanted is essentially what makes her character that much more lovable to me.Cath is a character that I really loved. I feel like I'm a lot like her in my determination to have a family, my propensity for \"nesting\" and the dreamy, emotional personality. She does pull a few crazy, obsessive stunts in this book, but somehow, I find her mood swings understandable. There are many times that I find myself empathizing with her (and often to the point of tears in my eyes).The StoryThis story just took my breath away. The reality of the struggle that Sarah Rayner presents in her story ignited a strong emotional response. I honestly found that, while I was reading, my emotions were going all over the place - there were moments of happiness, deep sorrow, bitterness, rage. To have a story play on my emotions like that... well, I can honestly say that I think it's an incredible ability for a writer to have.Using two women's different, but parallel stories to tell this particular tale was genius to me. Weaving both together made for a more interesting novel. I never felt like jumping from one to the other was confusing, as their stories are definitely easy to distinguish. The lapse in time, though often clarified later on, was a little confusing.I would rather not go into detail about the plot in order not to spoil it, but I thought Sarah Rayner did a wonderful job with her storytelling. Everything that occurred felt real to me, in the sense that it could happen to me or someone I know. I felt like I became much more aware of a few things after reading the novel.Personally, I say you should...Read this novel if you're interested in checking out adult books this year. It's a compelling, emotional read - and I absolutely loved it. The Two Week Wait will definitely strike a particular emotional chord in your heart."}, {"userName": "Juliet Loves Books", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4476395-juliet-loves-books", "userReview": "I loved One Moment One Morning and Sarah Rayner's new novel does not disappoint. The Two Week Wait is about the fertility struggles some women face - in this story, a gay woman who wants a child and a straight couple who are unable to conceive naturally. Bizarrely, despite how common fertility problems are today, it doesn't seem to be a topic covered in novels, at least I haven't come across another, and reading the lives of Rayner's characters does feel like a realistic and close-up insight into what it might be like to be on that difficult journey - the painful desperation, the not knowing if treatment will work, how other people might judge you, and so on. It also makes you think about the lengths you might go to were you in a similar position to the characters. This story particularly focuses on egg-sharing, which I hadn't even heard of before and which is fascinating. What I didn't know, before reading The Two Week Wait, is that the main characters from One Moment One Morning are carried over, as it were, and so we get to find out what happens next to them. That said, it doesn't matter if you haven't read OMOM, this novel does stand on its own. So as well as being a story about trying to have babies, it is also about friendship and the bonds that bind. And it has a great ending, a last line that hit me out of the blue, sent a shiver down my spine and I had to catch my breath. I would definitely recommend this book."}, {"userName": "Gabrielle Kimm", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4672355-gabrielle-kimm", "userReview": "I had absolutely loved 'One Moment, One Morning', so was very much looking forward to Sarah Rayner's new book. And then, as I began to read, I was delighted to find that the characters I had most cared about in that first book (especially Lou - my favourite from OMOM) were featuring in this new story.There is a tenderness in Sarah Rayner's writing which I really love - her characters are real, believable, engaging. This second story revolves around IVF - not something about which I knew very much at all when I began reading - and I learned a great deal about the procedure from reading the book. But the story wears its research very lightly, and the driving force of the book throughout is the interaction between the characters and how the realities of IVF impact on them.A terrific read.

I was literally forcing myself to read it just to get it over with. I'm sure a lot of it has to do with the fact that I'm American and therefore didn't understand a lot of the \"Proper English\". At one point I felt as though I'd be better off keeping a thesaurus on hand to translate. Word choices aside, I understand this is meant to be a touching story, but there's no need for it to be so damn depressing. I only laughed twice, and both of those were well after 200 pages in. I also understand that IVF is a tricky procedure and doesn't work like magic every time (surprise, modern medicine does have it's limits), but to add not one but two failed IVF treatments on top of a successful battle with caner just adds insult to injury. The fact that Cath's sister in law Sukey is such a heartless bitch about the whole thing just turns everything spiteful. And while I get that the egg sharing program is a fantastic way to go about IVF, it almost seems unfair that the egg donor gets everything financially taken care of while the egg recipient is almost bankrupted by the attempts.There were also several times during the book where I thought for sure Lou and Cath would put two and two together through their online forum, and have some way of being in contact that way, but no. Instead we have to wait until the very end of the book for them to have any sort of semi-anonymous contact via the fertility clinic. The only truly cute thing about the whole story is that Cath sends Lou the baby blanket she'd made for her own future baby during her first two week wait. And then you realize the book is over and you're just overcome with joy. It's finally over!! No more agonizing pain as you force yourself to soldier on in the hopes that things get a bit better. I would not recommend this book to anyone easily susceptible to bouts of depression as it will seriously make it worse. However, I do recommend it for anyone that's somehow romanticized IVF into being a miracle cure because it'll serves as a a brutal wake up call.

The story of two women that don't know each other, still are connected. Lou, a lesbian woman, hears after an operation that she shouldn't wait too long if she's thinking about getting children. Her partner Sofia is not ready for children (or will probably never be ready), so they split up. The other woman is Cath. Cath is cancer survivor and will not be able to get children in a natural way. Unless she gets the eggs from another woman. And that's where the lives start to connect, because Lou is going to be the donor of eggs that Cath will receive. The book tells about the background of their lives, their relationships (partner, friends, family), how they get to the decision of hopefully becoming mothers and then the medical procedure and of course after the egg implantation.The book is an easy read, lots of emotions, up until the end. I found however an imbalance in the beginning and middle part. To me the decisions of the two women and their partners (including Lou's perm donor) were a bit rushed. Those are big decisions! I would have preferred a bit more thoughts and dialogue here. No wonder Sofia runs away! The middle part, after the decision, on the other hand was too long and too detailed. The author clearly did her homework on the medical part and everything was explained in a clear words, but it slowed down the story. The speed picked up towards the end to the best part of the book.

However, having now read it I can't say I really enjoyed it or thought it a worthy successor to her first book.This is almost entirely down to the subject matter and my complete lack of interest in pregnancy, IVF and motherhood - as this is pretty much the entire subject of the novel it wasn't ever a book I was going to enjoy or rave about.I also didn't realise until I picked the book up that it included some of the same characters from One Moment, One Morning. I'm not sure how I feel about this - part of me enjoyed seeing them again, but another part felt that it was a bit of a cheat on the part of the author.

If you read the first book (and you really don't need to - this one will stand alone) you'll remember that Lou is gay, so there begins the search for a father, followed by IVF treatment which means she produces more eggs than she needs. I've never fully understood the agony of women who want a family beyond all else (I don't have a maternal bone in my body), but I understand it considerably better after reading this book. Sarah Rayner deals in raw emotion in an accessible and readable style, she has an equally deft touch dealing with love and friendship, and I loved this book every bit as much as I loved her first.

My favorite character was Anna, as she's the friend everyone wants to have. She is thoughtful and kind in both books. The reason it's only four stars is because Sukey who is Cath's sister in law really annoyed me. She was so judgmental and thought she was perfect in every sense of the word, and every time her scenes came up I wanted to throw the book out the window.
