He describes God as being at home and we returning to find him in the present moment. Using the imagery of the parable of the prodigal son, Hasse describes our need to leave the pigpen of our false self and come to the place of our true self. BelieveHasse quotes greats such as Meister Eckhart and St. John of the Cross. He builds his argument on the finding of God in the present moment where God communes with the imago dei in the true self. Meister Eckhart\u2019s quote is central, \u201cGod is at home. It is we who have gone out on a walk.\u201d If this is true then it follows that our work is to turn away from those tings that draw us to wander away from home and return to our house. Hasse calls these attention-drawing things the empty P\u2019s according to his alliterative ordering.DoubtHasse\u2019s focus on the present moment can leave us unbalanced with reference to the future. At it\u2019s worst we can spend the present moment lost in the false self, unconscious of the consequences of our actions. At it\u2019s best such and imbalance fails to recognize the power of time to bring change. With out time change could not occur. The proper corrective to an unbalanced focus on the present moment is Hasse\u2019s reference to the cyclical journey of awakening, illumination, purgation and union. One can also take issue with the true/false-self dichotomy as with out basis in scripture. However I find it does a good job in recognizing the imago dei is still within the midst of fallen humanity. SynthesisWhile I have had my fill of alliteration (after Kellemen) Hasse makes good sense in his empty P\u2019s and escape from the pig pen. I found myself of thinking of Innocent Smith as I read about living with disciplined focus in the present moment with awe and wonder. The material is easy to balance and integrate into my spiritual journey.ApplicationThis book is rich with material, I can see myself returning to it as I teach my congregation about the spiritual life. The things that grab my attention right now are a couple practices Hasse mentions. One is the use of a word with little meat on it to return our attention to the presence of God. I found my mind immediately drawn to the word \u201cstone.\u201d Perhaps it is because of the stone\u2019s lack of meat, or because I see it sitting at the side of the door to my home. I imagine it like some teleporter, that all I have to do is think about it and I am back at my door, ready to engage God in the present moment. The other thing that was very timely was Hasse\u2019s treatment of lent (pp 96-110). His description of a feng shui reestablishing and preserving of relationships gave penance a needed focus to me."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Dec 07, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5655149-amanda", "userReview": "Very good read to help you remember exactly what the false self is and how to stay away from it. Gives good methods on how to be aware of God in the here and now."}, {"userName": "Amanda Weaver", "userReviewDate": "Oct 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33814383-amanda-weaver", "userReview": "The title can be misleading. This book is about Christian Spirituality (mindfullness, meditation, mysticism, living out our prayer) and how every one of us can experience it. A quote from the Foreward gives a good description, \"In this book we have a resource for Chrisitan spirituality that effectively taps the wealth of the Christian spiritual traditionin a way that makes it accessible to contemporary readers.\" This book is an excellent guide to finding yourself home in God and living in the present in the Presence of God as the author says. The author also uses the phrase that our life should be focused on Thee (God) and thee (neighbors) instead of \"me\".Fabulous and easy read."}, {"userName": "Lori Neff", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24749751-lori-neff", "userReview": "Typical Fr.

It has a good chapter near the end on spiritual direction (which directees might want to read first). The book as a whole serves as a good outline for a spiritual journey that is focused on becoming your \"true self\" (the person God made you to be) and leaving the \"false self\", with its attachments to things that separate us from God and stunt our spiritual growth, behind. I particularly liked the chapter 5 introduction to contemplative prayer (\"how prayer makes us prayerful\") which redirects the activity of prayer from something we must do, accomplish, get done to a means of holding ourselves more consciously in God's presence throughout our day. The chapters on penance (as a means of preserving relationships) and discernment are very helpful also. The last chapter on the \"ongoing work of the Spirit\" presents the traditional pattern of human development and spiritual growth (awakening, purgation, illumination, dark night, and union) in a very practical and helpful way. He points out that each person's journey is unique, God isn't bound by and particular road map, God will not trump his gift of free will to us, and that spiritual growth is more cyclical (or spiraled) than a linear progression. Each chapter ends with several good reflection questions. The book also has some appendices with helpful information on designing a \"rule of life\" and finding a spiritual director. There is also an appendix which collects most of the charts and lists that are placed through out the book as a helpful aid to memory for the author's most important points. One thought that seems to run through the whole book is that there is really \"nothing more to get\" in life other than what our experience of God's life provides. That life does not consist in the regrets and losses of our past or in our hopes and fears for the future. It it most profoundly experienced in the \"here and now\". Without that there is no healing for our past or confidence for our future."}, {"userName": "Lain", "userReviewDate": "Sep 27, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/652191-lain", "userReview": "I emjoyed this simple volume on finding your way back to God's will -- which is, indeed, where you are right at this moment. With practical examples and simple language, Haase explains the earthly temptations we face every day, and how they separate us from the Lord, our true home, our true self. He discusses the seven deadly sins (an analysis I found particularly interesting), and shares practices to bring you back to self/God/home.Gentle, thought-provoking, and easy to read, this would be a great book for a study group or individual contemplation."}, {"userName": "Dean P.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1100134-dean-p", "userReview": "Haase does a great job tying together so many themes of the Christian life. He brings in early church and spiritualist themes, brings in the medieval era mystics, and interacts with modern-day Christians like Merton, Bonhoeffer and Mother Theresa. I especially like his chapters on discernment and spiritual discipline and will surely refer back to them over and over again."}, {"userName": "Rose", "userReviewDate": "Jan 05, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2236836-rose", "userReview": "Christian orientation that examines the many ways people create false selves to fill the hole in our hearts.

It is we who have gone out for a walk.\" --Meister Eckhart InComing Home to Your True Self,  Albert Haase invites you to return home--and shows you the way to get there. \"Home,\" he writes, \"is the sacrament of the present moment. It is only living right now, right here, that we discover our lives and this world awash in the grace of God.\" Using the story of the prodigal son to illustrate the far country of our false self and the way back home to our true self in Christ, Haase introduces us to the spiritual disciplines that can help us find the path home to the Father. Rich with insights from Haase's experience as a spiritual director, this is a book for the weary, the lost, the regretful and guilty--essentially, a book for us all. No matter how long you've walked, God is still home.", "title": "Coming Home to Your True Self: Leaving the Emptiness of False Attractions", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2635619-coming-home-to-your-true-self", "average": 4.17, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1348307552l/2635619.jpg", "reviews": 12, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/244137.Albert_Haase", "name": "Albert Haase"}], "type": ["Spirituality", "Psychology", "Religion"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2635619-coming-home-to-your-true-self", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16144835-catching-fire-becoming-flame", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6011281-living-the-lord-s-prayer", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/937800.Swimming_in_the_Sun", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13626633-athanasius", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9551688-this-sacred-moment"]}
