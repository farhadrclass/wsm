I picked this up from the library's holiday display table. I don't have very high expectations for these types of books, people. I approach it as I would a Hallmark channel Christmas movie: no need for a complicated or unique plot line, complex characters, or lyrical prose. The only expectation is for it to deliver on what is promised, namely a mindless read full of Christmas cheer. Christmas should be a driving force behind the plot. Unfortunately, that was not the case with this book (or many Hallmark channel Christmas movies). At first I really enjoyed the premise and the characters. I identified with Jennie and her family, both the move to a new place hoping for a fresh start and the dire financial straits they found themselves in. While not immediately apparent, I could see how Christmas could become a driving force for solving conflict and delivering the feels that I was hoping for. But, that didn't happen. Instead, the family solved their conflict in a climax outside of the Christmas season and there was an epilogue-like chapter describing all the ways the family was so much happier. But then there was still another 50 pages of ... the family being happy, and then it was Christmas. The End. A happy ending and a cheerful one, but not one that makes you love the magic of Christmas. I also found the idealization of the Amish lifestyle and the constant perfection of all their ways annoying. I suppose the moral of the story is not the magic of Christmas, but the magic of being Amish."}, {"userName": "Shirley Chapel", "userReviewDate": "Nov 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64314194-shirley-chapel", "userReview": "Thoroughly enjoyed this book. First time for me to read anything by Cynthia Keller. I'm a person drawn to pretty covers on books. I loved the peaceful country setting as an Amish buggy makes its way across a wooden bridge. I love anything Amish but this book is a story about a dysfunctional English family that makes friends with an Amish family.Shep Davis has lost his job again. There's just not that much work available where the Davis family lives in Massachusetts. Things look grim for the family as their savings has dwindled down to nothing. Then out of the blue Shep learns that a distant cousin who he's never met from Lancaster County Pennsylvania has passed away and left his house and cycle business to him. Jennie and Shep look at this opportunity as a fresh beginning. A chance to start over again. Their kids aren't happy about the move but there's really not much of a choice for the family. They set out on the highway to make the long trip to Lancaster County Pennsylvania. Tired and grumpy from the long trip they arrive at their new home. They pull in the driveway and sit there stunned by what they see. Things are not what they expected. The house is run down and in need of repairs. The lawn over grown. Did they come all this way for nothing?From there the story begins. I thought the Author put a lot of feeling into the story. There are sad times and good times. The story takes place over a year and a half span of time. They go through two Christmas seasons. A lot of changes are made. I hope that if you read this you will enjoy it as much as I did."}, {"userName": "Diane U", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3088649-diane-u", "userReview": "The David family moves to Lancaster County, PA to live in a house left to them from a family member as well as an established business. The house and business were both in rough shape. Jennie Davis is hoping this move is just what her family needed to get back together. Her son, Tim and daughter, Willa, were both miserable teenagers; neither wanted to be there or to help out. Jennie was struggling to make the house a home and hold her family together. Then she started talking to an Amish neighbor, Mattie Fisher, when she would take the dog on walks. A friendhsip bloomed between their families that became invaluable. Will the Davises find happiness and become a family again? What will they learn from their Amish neighbors to help that?Although this book focused more on the Davis family than the Fisher family, it was still considered an Amish book. I did enjoy growing with the Davis family and watching them change as time passed by. But this was not the typical Amish books that I read. This book made the Amish seem like anyone who knows an Amish person can change their life around for the better. I thought the story was good overall; although I would have liked to get to know more of the Fisher family. It was a heart warming Christmas story about family, love and forgiveness."}, {"userName": "Dianne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1401819-dianne", "userReview": "An Amish Gift by Cynthia KellerWhile this could have been a real sappy story that most people of this day and age would not believe; this was not that sort of story. I loved the fact that this non-Amish family, the Davis\u2019s had problems, REAL problems and the Amish while being stoic and helpful ,never preached, They just saw what needed to be done and then did it. In addition, I loved the fact that the problem solving was give and take. So many authors have the Amish become resistant to accepting any advice or help or even friendship from the Americaners.The Davis family is on the brink of bankruptcy when an inheritance forces them to move from Massachusetts to Lancaster Penn. Two adults, two teenagers\u2019 and a dog crammed into a car hauling a trailer of their worldly possessions. When they reach their destination things just aren\u2019t as good as they could have hoped and the family makes their dissatisfaction clear to Jennie. Jennnie is holding the family together with string and prayers at this point. Until one day an inadvertent aside from her son allows her to try something new, something that could really help them get out of their financial mess.This is a character driven story that spans 2 Christmases. A lot happens in these few pages. But one this I will say is that for a while I thought Jennie was allowing herself to be the whipping post, taking garbage from each member of her family. Nevertheless, she stuck it out, and I\u2019m so glad she did.This family was quite \u2018real\u2019 to me as was the neighbors and friends of the neighbors.

The story begins with what is a new beginning for the Davis familly..Jennie, Shep, Tim, Willa and their dog Scout. Can you imagine a relative you have never heard of leaving you their home, and business? What we soon discover is that both the house and business need a lot of TLC. On several walks with Scout, Jennie meets an Amish family, first Mattie Fisher, and then the whole family and extended.We travel through two Christmas's with the Davis Family, on the first there is so much anger and bitterness. As we travel along the next year, something changes.What an enjoyable read between the two cultures. Yes there are differences, but there are also many of the same problems.

Jennie\u2019s own older sister Hope abandoned her family upon graduation and just disappeared, leaving teenage Jennie to care for their alcoholic and abusive mother until the latter\u2019s death. Now, when Shep loses his latest job, they pack up and move to beautiful Lancaster County, PA, where Shep has inherited a vacant house from a distant cousin, along with the cousin\u2019s old bicycle shop. While walking the dog in the mornings, Jennie forges a friendship with her Amish neighbor, Mattie Fisher. However, the Davis family continues to struggle financially. Jennie\u2019s attempt to help out by embarking upon a candy-making enterprise collides with Shep\u2019s growing stress at work, and long-simmering tensions between husband and wife rise to the surface. Also, the kids are having trouble adjusting to their new environment. In addition, the dog is hit by a car and requires some three thousand dollars of veterinarian\u2019s care, and Tim is involved in an automobile accident with Peter Fisher. Will the Davises be able to solve their difficulties, or will this move result in the end of their family? My wife Karen enjoys reading books set among the Amish people. This one sounded good, so I decided to read it as well. Cynthia Keller is also the author of An Amish Christmas and A Plain and Fancy Christmas. There is very little objectionable in this tale. The Davises don\u2019t appear to be a religious family, but the Fishers are faithful to their Amish beliefs. Shep tends to drink a lot of beer at first to drown some of his sorrows, the attitudes of Tim and Willa are both fairly rotten to begin with, and even Jennie has to struggle with some serious emotional issues, but in the end they all learn some important lessons and everything seems to work out for the best. No, the Amish aren\u2019t perfect, but it\u2019s nice to read a novel in which neighbors help each other and people who have problems deal with them based upon the accepted traditional values which have generally characterized our society for many generations. An Amish Gift is a feel-good story that I enjoyed very much."}, {"userName": "Arlena", "userReviewDate": "Apr 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6139982-arlena", "userReview": "Author: Cynthia KellerPublished by: Ballantine BooksAge Recommended: YA - AdultReviewed By: Arlena DeanBook Blog For: GMTARating: 5Review:\"An Amish Gift\" by Cynthia Keller was a good novel It really was just a great, short, sweet, feel-good book to read especially during this blessed holiday. \"It was definitely a reminder of what is really important during the holidays.\" We find that this story is of the 'Davis Family' which consisted of Jeannie (mom), Shep (dad) Tim, Willa (the children) and Scout(the dog). We will travel through two different Christmas's with this family where the first Christmas was one full of sadness, bitterness and much anger. As the story moves along we now find that the Davis Family has moved due to an inheritance. They thought this was a good move due to the fact that Shep has lost his job and their finances were nearly in bankruptcy. Maybe a new start in a new place would be great but upon on arriving the 'new house' and Shep's new job a lots of TLC was needed. You can see in the read that \"Jennie was holding the family together with a string and a prayer.\" \"When the family befriends their Amish neighbors, the Fishers, their home life gradually becomes more civilized and happy.\" \"When Jennie finds a business that she can run, with the help of her family, things look up for them.\" Now, this is the time that I will say you must pick up the excellent read to see how the author gets the reader through this storm for the Davis's. It will be a bumpy ride but in the end...well you will see. \"An Amish Gift\" was a good clean book even with some Bible references in it that wasn't overly done. It was interesting to see the 'Davis Family' actually were learning from their Amish neighbors. So, if you are interested in a good clean read that could be read any time...not only at Christmas...I would recommend \"An Amish Gift\" novel to you."}, {"userName": "Marcy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11343011-marcy", "userReview": "What can we learn from the Amish? This wonderful book shows us the answer, how important family is. Even if our family is messed up, dysfunctional, or broken we still need to love them. We all make mistakes but it is how we forgive out loved ones and then support them through their troubles that count.I found the book a pure joy. I could relate to the characters on many levels, like how Jennie grew up with alcoholics for parents, hated the drinking and feared my husband would fall prey to alcohol as well. I have also had a rocky relationship with my children, family members and spouse. Ms. Keller makes the troubles of the Davis family believable and real and shows it is how we help each other that matters in life. Jennie watches how the Amish families around her handle the trials in life. She puts their values and forgiveness into action in her life and finds how her life becomes happier and more meaningful. Jennie starts a home business like her Amish friends, having her daughter help her market and make candy. The love and bond that grows between her and her daughter is a lesson we can all learn from and hopefully implement into our lives as well.I was surprised that the focus family was not Amish, but moved into an Amish area and learned a great deal about the importance of family through their friendship with the Amish. The Amish religion was mentioned but not the religion of the Davis family I think that added to the believability of the Davis family\u2019s difficulties, if they had God in their lives and Christian values then their lives wouldn't have been easier but they would have stuck together better and been happier in the process. I liked how all 4 Davis' learned from their Amish neighbors. The book is a clean read but I would have liked a few Bible references in it. I like more Bible references in the books I read, it makes me feel I'm reading a book and getting devotion time all in one, but I still truly enjoyed this book."}, {"userName": "Betty Strohecker", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34308442-betty-strohecker", "userReview": "When the Davis family relocate from Massachusetts to Lancaster, Pennsylvania, they are hoping for a new start. Jennie Davis tries to remain upbeat about the move since her husband Shep has inherited a house and bicycle shop from his uncle, after losing his most recent job. However, when they arrive, they find the house and shop in poor condition, requiring a lot of work on their already stressed budget. Their two teenage children are horrified with their new home and have a difficult time making friends at their new school. No matter what Jennie does to try to create a welcoming home and positive atmosphere, the family drifts farther and farther apart. Her attempts to get a job of her own cause tension with her husband, who has never wanted his wife to work, even though he has failed at all of his previous types of employment.The one bright spot in this dour situation is Mattie Fisher, an Amish neighbor that Jennie meets while walking her dog. As the two gradually develop a friendship, Jennie is amazed that Mattie's simple, but hardworking lifestyle is so peaceful. The family works a farm and all have their own chores, even the youngest of eight children. They are a true example of kindness and cheer, as they go about their daily life. Even Jennie's husband finds the Fishers have something special, as he gets to know them and often helps out at the dairy farm in his spare time. An emergency situation brings increased stress to the Davis family, and Jennie finds herself wondering if they can survive.This is a beautifully written book that addresses problems anyone might encounter. Cynthia Keller has created real characters that are easy to identify with and presents a wonderful picture of Amish lifestyle and beliefs."}, {"userName": "Kristine", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13667100-kristine", "userReview": "Jennie Davis and her family of four are less-than-thrilled-with their new house and lives in Pennsylvania.

Jennie tries holding the family together with the help of their faithful mutt, Scout. But the chasm between her bitter children and her struggling spouse, Shep, continues to widen. Abandoned by her elder sister to care for her alcoholic mother alone when she was a child, Jennie fears a recurrence of the same in her own family as Shep turns to alcohol to numb his own painful past. Constant bickering erupts into full-blown family friction, fraying what little resemblance of family the Davises have left. Then Jennies meets her Amish neighbors, the Fishers.

From there we deal w/ issues with her children Tim & Willa not being happy & finances being bad. Jennie eventually meets Mattie Fisher an Amish neighbor who becomes a quick friend as Jennie understands just how simple & enjoyable life can be. When finances become too tight, Jennie then gets an idea to start a candy business of her own which takes off solving life's problems. Keller's story takes place across close to 2 years & involves everything from deaths, family fights & a decision to leave the Amish community & at times gets to far off message to be of any consequence since it's almost predictable.

On morning walks, she forges a friendship with her Amish neighbor, Mattie Fisher, who opens up about her modest way of life. Mattie\u2019s unswerving good character in the face of adversity encourages Jennie to seek practical solutions to her own difficulties. A passing remark by Jennie\u2019s son transforms desperation about their finances into inspiration, leading her to embark upon a candy-making enterprise. \u00a0 Soon, Jennie\u2019s newfound purpose collides with Shep\u2019s growing stress at work and long-simmering tensions between husband and wife rise to the surface. As the holiday season approaches, their family is challenged as never before\u2014until an unexpected visitor arrives to give Jennie the greatest gift of all. \u00a0Praise for Cynthia Keller\u2019s heartwarming Amish novels \u00a0An Amish Christmas  \u00a0 \u201cThis little book is a holiday charmer young and old will find appealing.\u201d\u2014Fredericksburg Free Lance\u2013Star \u00a0 \u201c[A] sweet, poignant story.\u201d\u2014USA Today\u00a0A Plain & Fancy Christmas\u00a0 \u201c[This novel] does what a good holiday tale should; it invites readers to turn off the cellphone and television and wrap themselves up in a warm, compelling story.\u201d\u2014Lincoln Journal Star \u00a0 \u201cA wonderful read for the Christmas season.\u201d\u2014FaithfulNews", "title": "An Amish Gift", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13533653-an-amish-gift", "average": 4.09, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333577764l/13533653.jpg", "reviews": 61, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3236546.Cynthia_Keller", "name": "Cynthia Keller"}], "type": ["Amish", "Holiday", "Christian Fiction", "Christian Fiction", "Fiction"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13533653-an-amish-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19267298-an-amish-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7896352-an-amish-christmas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11447772-a-plain-fancy-christmas", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13531838-an-amish-holiday", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20146969-remembering-ruth-lyons"]}
