{"ratings": 580150, "userreviews": [{"userName": "Maciek", "userReviewDate": "Nov 22, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2969647-maciek", "userReview": "The most important things are the hardest things to say, because words diminish them...Some time ago the wise bald (or white) heads stationed at various universities came to an agreement that a literary form, commonly known as the novel, is dead - fewer and fewer works of any significance are written each year. Of course, one must understand the requirements the wise gentlemen expect of a novel of worth: it would be good if the writer would include some \"aesthetic dignity\" by including as much allusions and connections to other previous works of literature - consciously, that is. The language must also be exquisite; preferably obsure and as incomprehensible as possible, drawing from earlier works of worth and including metaphors and allusions to them. If the author by any chance happens to include a plot in his work, there is a good percentage of possibility that his work will be deemed unworthy, and forever excluded by the adacemia.Or at least as long as these wise gentlemen live.Of course, the reader is not expected to understand, not to mention enjoy the work of worth - no one reads anymore, the wise men would say; people read rubbish like Danielle Steel when Bold & Beautiful is not on the TV. And, by God, no such novel of worth can ever be popular - after all, the intelligence level required to appreciate it is apparently not met by the 90% of world population. A literary figure who is as popular and appreciated like The Beatles? Whose work is admired by thousands of people? And the possibility that these people might learn something from it? That is simply not possible - the wise heads mutter in unison - that is simply not possible! Ask people who know! Ask us!History, as we know it, has a nasty habit of repeating itself - though in this case something good might actually come out of it. Writers have been criticized before - most notably Twain and Dickens - and yet, their work is still read and loved by whole generations of readers. Their fiction is taught in schools. Huckleberry Finn has been deemed as vulgar and impropable, much od Dickens's work was described as overtly sentimental, but it prevailed - which can't be said about those who concerned themselved with being the so-called \"Arbiters of Literature\". In the end, they couldn't grind the knives because they weren't theirs to wield.The bones of those who tried to define \"literature\" perished; the works they so often tried to banish did not. No one remembers (or cares) about those who tried to defy the power of Twain or Dickens; they are immortal through their works.People perish; books do not. No one cares about the boy's club of the literati, who cry out words of rage from the ivory tower, instead of helping people understand the joy of reading, understanding and believing. The main principle of art is to evoke; the problem is, not many of the educated seem to understand that even simple things can evoke great emotions. But they too will go down in history without leaving any mark on it, forgotten and alone; and I believe that there will be a lot of bodies turning in their graves when some titles enter the school curriculum.\"IT\" by all means, is not a simple novel. To classify it as a \"horror\" story is the same as saying that \"Moby Dick\" is a very long manual on whaling. To say that it is all about the monster is to say that the whale is the villain of the piece.We all start out knowing magic. We are born with whirlwinds, forestfires, and comets inside us. We are born able to sing to birds and read the clouds and see our destiny in grains of sand. But then we get the magic educated right out of our souls. We get it churched out, spanked out, washed out, and combed out. We get put on the straight and narrow and told to be responsible. Told to act our age. Told to grow up, for God\u2019s sake. And you know why we were told that? Because the people doing the telling were afraid of our wildness and youth, and because the magic we knew made them ashamed and sad of what they\u2019d allowed to wither in themselves.-Robert McCammonAlthough vulnerable and physically weak, two factors that make them perfect victims, children posess strenght that most adults had lost in the painful process of maturing - the strenght of imagination. A child feels and experiences emotions much more intensely than an adult, but their unique imaginative capacity allows it to cope with the seemingly impropable much more efficiently. Hence when in 'Salem's Lot an adult faces a vampire, he fells down dead from a heart attack. When a child faces one, he is able to go to sleep ten minutes later. As King puts it, \"Such is the difference between men and boys\".King has been depicting children throughout his whole career, and his child characters have subsequently grown older, along with his own children. \"IT\" is in my opinion his best novel with child protagonists; his most elaborate, complex one. It's also one of his longest, if not the longest. The lenght is appropriate, because of the theme: After all, it deals with childhood. Childhood defies Time; a day can last forever, and the summers are endless. And then we grow up, all these years pass, just like a blink.Kids are bent. They think around corners. But starting at roughly age eight, when childhood's second great era begins, the kinks begin to straighten out, one by one. The boundaries of thought and vision begin to close down to a tunnel as we gear up to get along.-Stephen King, Danse MacabreChildren also posess another one of the invaluable assets that most adults strive to grasp, and it still seeps through their fingers, like sand: Time. Children experience the passing of time differently not because time actually slows down for them (that would be a neat thing indeed) but because they occupy a vastly different social position than that of an average adult. Most adults are forced to work and take care of their families, offspring included. Their imagination is dimmed by the countless hours spent on labor, and for most it never really comes back...the disilusions of experience push it farther abd farther down in the dungeons of the mind, until we finally forget that it was even there in the first place.Until we forget what we are possible of...what adventures we can create, what worlds and realms, completely out of the whole cloth.When you are a child the hours lazily pass by, the only important matter is to get home from school and after throwing the backpack in a corner going to get your friends and hanging out with them till dinner...and then go hang out with them some more.The imagination is an eye, a marvelous third eye that floats free. As children, that eye sees with 20/20 clarity. As we grow older, its vision begins to dim . . . and one day the guy at the door lets you into the bar without asking to see any ID and that's it for you, Cholly; your hat is over the windmill. It's in your eyes. Something in your eyes. Check them out in the mirror and tell me if I'm wrong.The job of the fantasy writer, or the horror writer, is to bust the walls of that tunnel vision wide for a little while; to provide a single powerful spectacle for that third eye. The job of the fantasy-horror writer is to make you, for a little while, a child again.Most children experience more during one summer vacation than some adults throughout their whole life; They have their precious innocence, they haven't been spoiled by work, by taxes, by bills and other things that each of us has to face at some point in life. There is always food in the fridge, and there is always roof over the head; and if there is not, there is always hope that there eventually will be, and friends that help to keep it.Children do more and see more because they can; when school ends, the day is theirs. Their schedule is not as strict as that of an adult; their duties not as responsible. Therefore, they do not have to trouble themselves with money and shelter, and even if they do they are easily able to push these matters away and concentrate completely on what they are doing right here and now. With little breaks for homework and chores children can spend the whole day playing make-believe with their precious friends, and sometimes the boundaries between the real and the imagined become thin, and sometimes they vanish altogether. Sometimes their thoughts take shapes...and sometimes their fears do too. Sometimes they joy is almost tangible...and sometimes the boogeymen come out of the closet.And sometimes they are real.\"IT\" is a story of a group of children who are not among the most popular, strongest or smartest; a tale about the group of seven friends living in Derry, Maine in 1958. They form the self-called \"losers\" club and encounter a horrible, awesome force lurking in their hometown...a force feeding on fear and devouring young children. A force that adults do not seem to see; a force that appears as a clown, holding a hand full of baloons.The seven children all have one thing in common: they encountered IT. They had all escaped...and that one summer of 58, the seven friends have confronted and defeated IT.Or so they had thought.28 years later a young homosexual is thrown off a bridge in Derry...it seems like a classic, clear case of homophobia, but the testimony of one of the witnesses changes everything.He claims he has seen a clown under the bridge...a clown and a cloud of balloons.Mike Hanlon, the sole member of the losers who remained in Derry calls the others and reminds them of the promise they had made all these years ago...a promise sealed in blood. A vow to return if IT wasn't dead. If IT will come back. And apparently, IT has.Can they face IT again? Can they go back to the horror they have long forgotten?They faced the terror as children. It was their time to take action, and they managed to fight it. Now they are all grown-up...but it is their time,too.Will the monster be bested...or will IT FEED?\"IT\" is composed of two nonlinear narratives. The first is the story of 1958, where we meet the children and they first encounter IT; King effortlesly interleaves this timeline with the story of 1985, where the adults return to Derry to fight IT, basing on research that has been done on the subject and their returning memories. IT avoids the problems of most other lenghty books: plot threads that go nowhere. Each of them is important, and only adds to the suspense and builds up to the shattering climax.If there is a thing which places King above most other writers, it certainly is his great understandning of adolescence. Few others manage to write so vividly and convinclingly about childhood and coming of age.The unquestionably hard time of growing up - school, bullies, parents, first crushes - they are all here, and the reader feels as if he himself was experiencing them. King allowed me to re-live my past again; I wasn't around in 1958, but if I were I would undoubtedly be one of the boys. It is truly an impressive experience to read how King builds his characters and the world they live in.Which of course includes stormdrains...which might be empty, but then they might be not.IT also manages to adress important social topics: racism, prejudice, domestic abuse. But most importantly it is a story about friendship and childhood: How it irrevocably binds people together and affect their lives. About the power of memory and imagination; about the terror of the familiar world which hides many secrets around the corners and down in the sewers. It's a study of children facing the uncanny, and overcoming their greatest fear: the fear of being alone in fright.IT is a story of seven friends, each different, each indispensable and irreplaceable.stuttering Bill Denbrough, the unlikely group leader; Ben Hansocom, an overweight boy, with a talent for architecture;Riche Tozier, the brilliant witty boy of many voices;Mike Hanlon, the black kid who comes to the group to find acceptance and finds it;Eddie Kaspbrak, the asthmatic and fragile boy who finds within the group a thing he has never dreamed of - courage;Stan Uris, a sensible boy who brings understanding;and Beverly March, the sole girl in the group, an redhead who is both sweet and tough, and helps the boys in most dire of moments.King has proven himself earlier to be capable of producing an epic narrative (The Stand in 1978), but I think that IT is equal to - or even surpasses - the story of the plague.This is a brilliant novel, beautifully told in crisp, clear prose, with truly unforgettable characters and situations. It is the essence of good fiction; the truth inside the lie. King knows his way around the corners; and has that undefiniable look in the eye, the dreamy look of a child. His words are the best set of toys he ever had; and he's generous enough to share them with us. And when he's showing us how his trains travel along the tracks of his imagination and where they go to, we won't dare to blink because we could miss a minute of the experience...even when the carriage passes through some dark tunnels.And if it is the work of an \"inadequate writer\", a producer of \"penny dreadfuls\", without any \"aesthetic value\" or other high-flown pretentious gibberish babbled by people who would most likely want to cast Stephen King and his readers to hell for destroying the image of \"Literary Reader\"?Like Huck Finn, I'd shout loud \"All right, then, I'll GO to hell!\"Literary Heaven might have a better climate; but Literary Hell sure has better company."}, {"userName": "Zo\u00eb", "userReviewDate": "Oct 24, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9303625-zo", "userReview": "I read this entire book in one day during my 24-hour readathon, #readathonbyzoe! Watch the vlog here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W9Vcd...I highly enjoy Stephen King's descriptive writing style! He surprisingly made this story seem like it had to be 1,200 pages long. I was on the edge of my seat for the majority of the novel, and I definitely did not sleep well the following night! This is one of the best horror novels I've ever read. However, I hate his constant use of slurs against black, Jewish, and gay characters. I understand that he is using them as a tool to highlight the real horrors in our everyday lives, but it was 100% not necessary to use them with such frequency. That is the one reason why I could not bring myself to give this book a 5/5 stars even though I loved the rest.Also, TW for sexual assault, domestic abuse, and suicide."}, {"userName": "Jennifer", "userReviewDate": "Oct 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11697287-jennifer", "userReview": "Some parts were truly creepy at first and initially, as often happens with King, I couldn't put it down. But then, as often happens with King, it hits a brick wall and becomes so over-long and has so many unnecessary elements that get in the way of the main story that it becomes a bloated, endless chore to finish. People often say they hate the ending of this book...I did not hate it or love it. I had checked out at that point and simply wanted it to be over no matter who lived or died or whether they defeated It or not.This book is at least 300 pages too long and that is the least that could have been completely cut out without hurting the story in the slightest. Included in those 300+ pages are some particularly disturbing sequences and elements which were just sickening, unnecessary and, to me, actually took away from the main story.The events and elements that killed \"It\" for me: 1. A bizarre, out-of-nowhere scene portraying sex play between two male pre-teen, would-be murderous bullies--which had nothing to do with the story and led nowhere.2. An extended description of animal torture/killing--which stemmed from the bully in the sex-play, which had nothing to do with the story and ultimately, again, was pointless and unnecessary.3. A detailed description of a kid murdering a baby sibling. No point, nothing to do with the story. Again.4. The use of the \"N\" word more in one place than I have ever read or heard in my life combined. Not necessary, nothing to do with the main part of the story. 5. And, the scene which blew me away and pretty much made me feel I had wasted time getting that far in: a gang-bang consisting of nothing but 11 and 12-year-olds. What the F***? And when I say \"gang bang\" I mean it--six boys banging the girl back-to-back. Only abnormal people do not raise an eyebrow at this scene and try to defend it as being \"natural\" and \"normal.\" It's neither and most decent people would be bothered by this segment. So, aside from those main awful things the other annoying elements: the character of Richie. I skipped a lot of his dialogue. I wanted to punch him in the face just for being annoying. And every time he did his \"Mexican\" voice I just cringed and skipped the next couple lines. Never has a character in a BOOK annoyed me so, so much. I was hoping he would die. Their stupid inside joke of \"Beep-beep, Richie.\" By the twelve thousandth time one of them said this I wanted to just throw the book across the room. Painful to read. In the end King took a super creepy story and concept which he could have effectively told in probably 500 pages and blew it up to over 1,000 with too much detail in certain parts, too much back story in others and too many subplots which didn't matter. All of which pretty much wiped out any fear or creepiness for me. By the time I got 700 or so pages in I simply was not scared, not creeped out, no longer interested and didn't care how it ended as long as it ended soon. I am aware that some people will feel that I \"just don't get it\" with my review and complaints. I am totally fine with that. I am totally fine not \"getting it\" when it comes to this type of thing. :) Too bad. Started off as five stars for me and crumbled onto itself into two stars."}, {"userName": "Khanh, first of her name, mother of bunnies", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4527753-khanh-first-of-her-name-mother-of-bunnies", "userReview": "I'm not easily scared these days. As a grown woman, the only thing that brings the feeling of dread into my heart is the constant pinging of new work emails requiring my attention when I'm at home, but there was a time when I was a shy, delicate, sweet little girl who was scared of my own shadow.Proof: not exactly the terror you see haunting the hallowed halls of Goodreads handing out 1 stars like they're candy these days.It wasn't until I was around 20 that I outgrew my fear of scary creatures and things, and stopped tucking in my toes between the blankets, lest they get eaten by monsters, but before that happened...there was It. I can say with complete confidence that this goddamn book (and the movie) scarred me for life.A sentiment that I'm sure many of you who have read the book and seen the movie echoes.I remember the exact moment I saw this movie. It's not something one forgets.I was 16 years old. I was in Academic Decathlon competition in high school, and after studying for the competition, our little group decided on a movie night. The selection: Stephen King's It.From the moment that goddamn clown popped up on the screen from beneath the sewer, I knew this was a terrible, no-good, bad idea. I spent the rest of the movie hovering on the edge of my seat, crouched between my best friends, hands either over my eyes or clamped over my mouth to suppress my screams.I went home. I didn't sleep that night. Neither did I get much sleep for the next two weeks. A few months later, it was winter. Spirit of the season. Clowns can't haunt me when it's Christmas, right? I was brave enough to actually read the book this time.Bad idea.So in closing, damn you, Stephen King. Out of all your books, this one has scarred me most. These days, I maintain a terror of two things: mummies (long story), and clowns. I can no longer visit theme parks at Halloween.Thank you, Mr. King. You shouldn't have. No, you really shouldn't have."}, {"userName": "Melissa \u2665 Dog/Wolf Lover \u2665 Martin", "userReviewDate": "Jun 29, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17438949-melissa-dog-wolf-lover-martin", "userReview": "Listened to the audio this time and it was awesome The narrator is Steven Weber and he did a great job! Hello, welcome to Derry.. I'm Pennywise the Clown and at some point, especially if your a kid, I will eat your face off! Have a nice day!The first time I read this book was in the 6th grade and I had forgotten how good it was! I loved the movie as well, but the book is so much better! I love how Mr. King goes back and forth from when the friends were kids and to them as adults and what they do in life now, while they are on their way back to Derry. See, when they were young and all became friends, they made a pact that if \"IT\" ever came back so would they. IT showed itself to them in many different creeptastic ways but \"IT\" showed itself more as Pennywise the Clown! Bill's little brother Georgie was the first one to be.. um.. eaten... by Pennywise. I'm sorry, I don't care how old I am, if I saw a creepy clown down in a drain-gutter thingy (leave me alone, I forgot the name!) I would have ran until I fell over! I mean..no..no...no.. and NO! Bill, Eddie, Ben, Richie, Stan, Beverly, and Mike are all friends. I love each of their separate stories and I love their friendship together. They are all picked on by the town bully/jerk named Henry Bowers, but when they are together Henry can just go on down the road when the little group gets their courage and attacks Henry and his gang. I love the camaraderie between the friends and how they believe each others stories of meeting Pennywise, even when he wasn't in clown form. They didn't ridicule each other, they watched out for each other the best they could. At one point they think they kill ole Pennywise, but after many years and the killing of kids starts happening again, Mike, who stayed in Derry at the library, calls everyone home. It's weird how they all forget anything that ever happened to them until they get that phone call. It's like they were made to forget. And there is sweet Pennywise to welcome them back! Uggggg, clowns!!!!!!!!I know there are some people out there that hasn't read the book so I won't give out any spoilers for them, but one of the group commits suicide before anything even gets started and another of the group gets killed before they kill Pennywise for good.. or is IT really dead? I think Mr. King should bring him back with a whole new set of peeps that have to take him out :) Yes, I'm not quite right in the head! This is a very long book to read, but you know good books like this one really doesn't matter the length, when they are written very well, it just doesn't seem like a tome. Well, with the exception of holding the book up if you have joint issues, just let it rest quietly on your lap tray while you read :) I didn't get bored not one time in this book, I did, however want to shoot a few people and of course Pennywise... but I digress. At the end Mr. King wrote:This book was begun in Bangor, Maine, on September 9th, 1981, and completed in Bangor, Maine, on December 28th, 1985.That's a good amount of time and would explain how freaking good the book was in all of the detail.

Nor was the clown simply swaddled in a bunch of bandages. There were bandages, most of them around its neck and wrists, blowing back in the wind, but Ben could see the clown\u2019s face clearly. It was deeply lined, the skin a parchment map of wrinkles, tattered cheeks, arid flesh. The skin of its forehead was split but bloodless. Dead lips grinned back from a maw in which teeth leaned like tombstones. Its gums were pitted and black. Ben could see no eyes, but something glittering far back in the charcoal pits of those puckered sockets, something like the cold jewels in the eyes of the Egyptian scarab beetles. And although the wind was the wrong way, it seemed to him that he could smell cinnamon and spice, rotting cerements treated with weird drugs, sand, blood so old it had dried to flecks and grains of rust\u2026\u201d\nOnce I turned the last page of 1,153 pages, I felt like Scribner or Stephen King or someone owed me a t-shirt saying...I survived IT. When I say IT, I\u2019m not just referring to the enormous length of the novel, but also the total sticky, blood encrusted emersion in this epic tale of horror. The book is two novels entwined together. One is set in 1958 when seven children take on this alien creature, and the other is these same children, now adults, returning in 1985 to fight this entity again. A publisher with an eye for more book sales might have convinced a writer, a different writer than Stephen King, to pull these books apart and sell them in two separate novels, but I\u2019m afraid we might have been talking about two three star books instead of one five star book. IT was meant to be.King manages to take these seven kids and make them into seven distinct personalities. After spending so much time with them, I feel like I know them better than friends I\u2019ve had for decades. Even as King reintroduces us to them again as adults, we see the personalities of the children, like a hot stamped template, still in the adults. Mike is the only one who stays in Derry, Maine. He becomes the town librarian, and by default, the person who keeps an eye out for signs of the return of IT. The other six all leave and become very successful. Bill becomes a novelist and overcomes his childhood stutter. Beverly becomes a fashion designer, but still can\u2019t shake her need to be with a man who hurts her. Ben loses all that weight he carried as a child and becomes a famous architect. Stan becomes a wealthy accountant. Richie is a disc jockey in LA. Eddie runs a successful limo service in New York. Mike speculates that IT has something to do with their career successes. But what exactly is IT?\u201dGlamour, he said, was the Gaelic name for the creature which was haunting Derry; other races and other cultures other times had different words for it, but they all mean the same thing. The Plains Indians called it a manitou...These same Indians believe that the spirit of the manitou could sometimes enter them\u2026 The Himalayans called it a tallus or taelus, which meant an evil magic being that could read your mind and then assume the shape of the thing you were most afraid of. In Central Europe it had been called eylak, brother of the vurderlak, or vampire. In France it was le loup-garou, or skin-changer, a concept that had been crudely translated as the werewolf, but, Bill told them, le loup-garou could do anything, anything at all: a wolf, a hawk, a sheep, even a bug.\u201d\nThe glamour creature who haunts Derry prefers the image of Pennywise the Clown because it is primarily interested in attracting and attacking small children. The first victim we are introduced to, at the very beginning of the novel, is Bill\u2019s younger brother George, who is pulled apart by IT while reaching for his paper boat which had fallen into the drain. Only Stephen King can begin a novel with such a horrific murder and keep readers glued to the pages. We have to know what the hell is going on? Our band of seven, or as they proclaim themselves The Losers Club, have watched plenty of horror films, so the things they fear have been manifested from the silver screen. Pennywise might morph into a mummy, Frankenstein, a large bird, a werewolf, a leper, a hideous spider, or a large crawling eyeball. Once one of the kids tells the others what he sees, they can see it, too. The creature must adhere to the rules of the game: if IT is a werewolf, for instance, then IT is susceptible to a silver bullet. Adults are incapable of seeing what the kids see. If blood spouts out of a sink and coats the walls and floor, only the kids know it is there. Once the \u201cLosers\u201d leave Derry to pursue their adult lives, they start to forget what happened. It is only when Mike calls them and asks them to come back in 1985 to stop the creature once again that they start to regain their memories. This time they won\u2019t give up until this hideous evil is vanquished...forever. \u201dGot to become a child again, he thought incoherently. That\u2019s the only way I can keep IT from driving me crazy. Got to become a kid again...got to stop it. Somehow.\u201d\nSometimes we have to crawl back into our inner child to survive the onslaught of visual overstimulation that can crack an adult brain like a rotten walnut. A young elastic brain does better with a world gone mad. At the end of the final battle, Derry will never be the same, nor will this reader. I, too, hope some of my memories fade as I travel further away from the pages of IT. If you are a fan of the horror genre, you have to read this book. There is no time like the present with the new, highly acclaimed movie out in theaters. Read the book. Watch the movie. Mind wipe.

So, why society is so inclined to accept and being really scared of a kind of character that was supposed to make us laugh? Of course, if they are chasing us with butcher knives, that helps to input the scary factor, but be honest, even in the first moment that you watch them, before they would do anything nasty, you are already scared with them. They look terrifying!Just like the one that it's breathing behind you right now...\nTHE POWER OF LIES\nWe lie best when we lie to ourselves.Sorry for the lie on the last line of the previous section. But it was just to introduce the most powerful element of this novel......the lies.I think that Stephen King, showed us how powerful can be the lies.The Losers Club were lying themselves pretending that nothing unusual happened on their childhoods. Even some of them were keep lying to themselves that their adult lives were okay. Lying in such powerful way that their memories are fractured.The adult people of the town of Derry were lying themselves too about the sexual preferences of some of their fellow neighbours.The town's Police officers are lying on their reports.Some moms were lying that their children had some illness.Pennywise is lying about ITs own real appearance to everybody.Lies, lies, lies!Some of us prefer to lie ourselves than facing our lives. The temptation of lying and creating false \"realities\" instead of dealing with the harsh truths.Lying ourselves instead of facing the real monsters in our lives. Even sometimes, lying ourselves that we haven't any other option than to deal with the monsters alone......when there are people around us willing to help us, if we just tell the truth.But telling the truth about our problems, many times is even scarier than the lies.All of us float......between lies and truths."}, {"userName": "Nayra.Hassan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2015", "userURL":

Death and disappearances are the norm and every 27 years they peak as more and more children are killed. When Bill's brother Georgie is killed by It, the mysterious thing behind Derry's darkness, Bill sets out to find it. Bill becomes part of a group of other children, all who have had run ins with It and together they get rid of It. They swear an oath to return to Derry if It ever comes back and starts killing and 27 years later they all return to face down It and try to get rid of It once and for all. Don't read past this point because I can't promise anything about no spoilers.I finally finished this god damn tome of a book, and I really wish I weren't so compulsive and obsessive about finishing every book I start because wow that was 1400 pages and I couldn't get into the story at all. Also I have a few questions and I feel like I may have missed something so if someone could answer these questions I would appreciate it and maybe then I might feel better about the book. First off it's mentioned that none of gang have children and it's alluded to as being part of what happened the first time with It but I didn't understand what that had to do with anything? Was there an actual explanation to this or was it just supposed to be there to be ~creepy~. Second why did they have to go out of their way to find It and get rid of it that first time, if It has cycles of 27 years wouldn't It eventually just have stopped on its own anyways because there's no way someone banished it every time it appeared because they're supposedly the only ones to have done so. Lastly what was the point of them having sex in the sewer, I'm not a prude but having 12 year olds do it in the sewer should have a better explanation than to bring them all together and bond them. I don't see how they had to do at all did he just put that in there to be outrageous because good job it worked. At times I did enjoy the book but it was just really long with so many characters and details and a lot of the time I felt myself getting bored like I didn't need such exact descriptions of the boat flowing down the sewer and the way it kept cutting back and forth especially towards the end between past and present just felt choppy and maybe that was the point but it just made me not get really into the book. When I read horror I have to lose some self awareness and get pulled in so I can be creeped out but the whole time I was too aware that I was reading a book and I just kept feeling like it wasn't scary at all. Especially with It morphing constantly like werewolves don't freak me out so I was just like wow a werewolf thats cool I guess. I do like Stephen King and he writes very well but this one just did not work for me and I guess I just missed something because everyone else seems to have really enjoyed this book."}, {"userName": "Anne", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1720620-anne", "userReview": "[You know at the end of the original battle with the creature when they are kids, the girl (Beverly) has sex with all the boys in the group to supposedly bring them all together or some such nonsense?

Bill Denbrough and his six best friends believe the murders are linked to something that lurks beneath their home town \u2013 something that crawled from their nightmares and has taken form in the shadowed recesses of the sewers. Driven by forces unseen, Bill and his friends sense they have what it takes to stop the monster. They vow \u2013 with a piece of broken glass sliced across their palms \u2013 to come back to Derry if evil ever returns. Twenty-seven years later, the murders have started again. It\u2019s time for Bill and his friends to honor their vow . . . Here in Derry children disappear unexplained and unfound at the rate of forty to sixty a year. Most are teenagers. They are assumed to be runaways. I suppose some of them even are. At over eleven hundred pages in length, It is a prolific book that provides significant backstory for each character and gives an abundant history of Derry, Maine. Because King provides so many specifics \u2013 almost to the point of excess \u2013 the book reads like a vast compilation of research collected on true events. Though the story is sometimes bogged down by the excessive specifics, quite often a slogging passage (that recounts a historical event) eventually arrives at such a disturbing conclusion that forging through a long, slow chapter becomes, with startling suddenness, a worthwhile read. What makes this book notorious, however, is the dreadful monster at the heart of the story: Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Pennywise \u2013 or It \u2013 is not as prevalent in the book as one might presume, given its classification as a horror novel, but any time It makes an appearance, the narrative drops readers into a dark scene where terrifying events unfold. Smells of dirt and wet and long-gone vegetables would merge into one unmistakable ineluctable smell, the smell of the monster, the apotheosis of all monsters. It was the smell of something for which he had no name: the smell of It, crouched and lurking and ready to spring. A creature which would eat anything but which was especially hungry for boymeat. Though it contains elements of horror, It is a literary coming of age story that just happens to take place in a small town were horrific events transpire. Instead of dividing the book into two parts, with the events of 1958 recounted first and the events of 1985 recounted second, King opts to tell both stories simultaneously with the use of clever plot pacing and an unorthodox chapter structure. This sometimes results in the narrative feeling redundant, but the story is so skillfully woven together that one cannot help but appreciate King\u2019s masterful stylistic approach to conveying two stories at once. With characters that feel like old friends and enough scares to keep readers up at night, It strikes a satisfying balance between literary writing and telling grim stories of violence and gore."}, {"userName": "Raeleen Lemay", "userReviewDate": "Oct 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3452652-raeleen-lemay", "userReview": "WHAT A RIDE.First off, I'd like to start out by saying I DON'T NORMALLY LIKE STEPHEN KING. If you look at the other books I've read so far (Carrie, The Shining, The Gunslinger, and Different Seasons), they have all been rated 3 stars or less. Yet somehow, this book really spoke to me. I will also say that the reason I picked this up in the first place was because of the new movie adaptation, which was SUPER GREAT, but also super different from the book in many ways. I'm so glad I decided to pick up the book though, so thank you movie for making that happen!The last 50 or so pages dragged a bit for me, but all in all I loved pretty much everything about this book. The plot was intriguing, and while it was a pretty slow book overall (and over 1100 pages at that!) I never found myself getting bored or sick of reading it. The characters were really well fleshed out, and by the end of the book they all felt like close friends.I've heard many people complain about the sort of non-linear narrative, saying it's confusing, but I thought it was perfect for this book! The past and present sort of meld together seamlessly, and it was very artistic and added a lot to the story for me. I also thought it was neat how in the last part of the book, sometimes it wasn't entirely clear whether or not you were reading about the past or the present, but it still made sense somehow.Lastly, I love how Stephen King deals with the idea of fear and how it can become a physical thing. I've also just recently watched The Mist where a similar idea exists, and I think it really adds a new level of terror! On the surface this book seems like it's just about a clown running around killing children, but really it's about a seemingly all-powerful being that feeds off the fear of Derry, and boy is Derry full of fear. OH man it's so freaky, but in a more surreal way than I expected. So I will say if you're wary of picking up this book because you think it will be full of scary stuff, I'd say don't worry; the new movie is scarier (and even then, it's mostly just bloody).I want to say EVERYONE PLEASE READ THIS but at the same time I know it's definitely not for everybody. It's full of swearing, bullying, racism, homophobia, sex, domestic/child abuse, and plenty of blood and guts to go around, but all of those things had a purpose and added to the theme of fear and how it affects people. Like I said though... Not for everybody. lol."}, {"userName": "Franco  Santos", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/29931457-franco-santos", "userReview": "It (Eso) es una de mis obras favoritas de King.

Son chicos marginados, v\u00edctimas del acoso escolar y de la xenofobia. Son amigos que por separado pueden parecer d\u00e9biles, pero juntos forman una fortaleza inquebrantable. As\u00ed se enfrentar\u00e1n a los chicos que los hostigan por ser diferentes, liderados por los crueles Henry Bowers y Patrick Hockstetter. Simultaneamente, desafiaran a Eso. Eso es un ser que despierta, aproximadamente, cada 25 a\u00f1os para alimentarse. El primer tiempo transcurre en 1957/1958, a\u00f1os en los que despierta nuevamente cobr\u00e1ndose su primera v\u00edctima, George, el hermano menor de Bill. Y ah\u00ed es donde comienza la historia. Pennywise eligi\u00f3 un mal momento para regresar, ya que se va a tener que enfrentar a Los Perdedores, ese peculiar grupo de amigos que lo tratar\u00e1 de derrotar y as\u00ed impedir que siga asesinando.El segundo tiempo transcurre en 1985, cuando los chicos ya son adultos y Mike Hanlon, por una promesa realizada en 1958, les escribe dici\u00e9ndoles que Eso ha vuelto. Por lo tanto se ven obligados a volver a Derry, al lugar donde comenz\u00f3 todo, para esta vez derrotarlo por siempre y evitar que siga haciendo m\u00e1s da\u00f1o.El libro es una completa obra maestra. Resalta por ser una de las historias m\u00e1s terror\u00edficas de Stephen King. Es una joya del g\u00e9nero de terror y de la literatura en general. Su edici\u00f3n de bolsillo consta de 1504 p\u00e1ginas y ninguna tiene desperdicio. Los personajes est\u00e1n excelsamente desarrollados, lo que hace imposible no sentirlos como reales, lo que hace imposible separarse de ellos. En cuanto al ritmo narrativo, es lento y, en algunas partes, pesado. Esto no es un defecto, sino lo contrario: una muestra de un armado minucioso que absorber\u00e1 en la historia hasta al m\u00e1s receloso lector.Con respecto al final tengo que decir que me dej\u00f3 al borde de las l\u00e1grimas. King suele fallar con sus cierres, pero, en mi opini\u00f3n, este es la excepci\u00f3n. \u00abTal vez no existen los buenos y los malos amigos; tal vez solo hay amigos, gente que nos apoya cuando sufrimos y que nos ayuda a no sentirnos tan solos. Tal vez siempre vale la pena sentir miedo por ellos, y esperanzas, y vivir por ellos. Tal vez tambi\u00e9n valga la pena morir por ellos, si as\u00ed debe ser. No hay buenos amigos, no hay malos amigos. Solo hay personas con las que uno quiere estar, necesita estar; gente que construy\u00f3 su casa en nuestro coraz\u00f3n\u00bb.Los Perdedores es un grupo entra\u00f1able. Son chicos inseguros de s\u00ed mismos, llenos de problemas, de adversidades, de sufrimiento, y juntos logran encontrar una salida entre tanta injusticia. Unidos se sienten especiales, pero no en el mal sentido, juntos le encuentran otro significado a la palabra especial. Jam\u00e1s me olvidar\u00e9 de Bill, Ben, Stan, Bev, Eddie, Mike y Richie. Me ense\u00f1aron a c\u00f3mo ver la vida. A enfrentarme a ella sin miedo, pero sabiendo bien mis l\u00edmites. Que no es necesario compartir sangre para ser familia. Que no es necesario ser perfecto para ser feliz. Que estar rodeado de lo que te hace bien es la mejor manera de afrontar lo que te hace mal. Esos amigos me ense\u00f1aron que cualquiera puede ser un h\u00e9roe, siempre y cuando se tenga el apoyo correcto.

The thing with King\u2019s horror books is that... I never thought they were scary. Actually, I can count on the fingers of one hand the number of times a book gave me this feeling. But maybe it's just me. I see people talking about how scary his books are. I only think they are insanely well written. IT especially.This is one of those books that make me think I would read King\u2019s shopping list if I could. The character development is godlike. Also, it\u2019s full of that specific well-known style that makes you wonder WHY THE HELL DO I NEED TO KNOW THAT? and I loved every single word of it!Also, I reaaaaaally liked The Dark Tower references! See the TURTLE of Enormous GirthOn his shell he holds the Earth.His thought is slow, but always kind.He holds us all within his mind.On his back all vows are made;He sees the truth but mayn't aid.He loves the land and loves the sea,And even loves a child like me.

Pennywise made an entire generation scared of clowns when the film came out, kinda topical now that all these assholes are roaming the streets in clown outfits. Suffice to say I'm extra scared to go for a walk!Above all, the best thing about this book is that it's wonderful. King manages to capture the essence of childhood and what it means to have a close group of friends. It's quite similar to Boy's Life in that respect. I was a tad reluctant to read this having watched the film and due to the 1376 pages (which took me over a month to read!!) but it was absolutely worth it. The ending, I think is better and there is, naturally, more story. The way it's written also highlights how talented a writer King is. He seemlessly jumps from kids to adults throughout. I doubt anyone could have pulled this off as clearly and as beautifully as King does. Although genuinely horrifying, this book captures childhood wonder perfectly and receives all the stars.

The idea that there\u2019s an underage gang bang on poor Bev to reestablish the connection between the Losers when they\u2019re lost in the sewers after facing It the first time is completely unnecessary and puts a layer of 'Ewww!' all over the childhood relationships.* Poor Bev really gets the worst of it in a lot of ways in this book. Not only does she have sex with six guys to save them all, she\u2019s the only one of the Losers to have an absolutely terrible life with her abusive husband as an adult. Granted, Eddie has a miserable marriage and Mike got stuck in Derry, but she\u2019s the only one who gets used as a punching bag which seems odd considering that King indicates that they\u2019re all under the spell/protection of the Turtle or whatever force of good made most of them rich but childless. ( Yeah, I know it relates back to her father, but it still seems grossly unfair.)* By the end two of the Losers are dead, and the survivors won\u2019t even get to remember each other or what they did.

First off, if the Losers can\u2019t remember what happened or even each other, how did they put up a memorial? Secondly, the idea that I read this mammoth story only to have King retroactively throw a shadow over the ending by putting a line into another book severely pisses me off. After the unambiguous statement that It was dead at the end, an author shouldn\u2019t play it cute and toss a line off for cheap thrills in something else that undermines the entire book.

What's odd about IT is that it has many horror elements, but focuses more on a coming-of-age story between seven children living in a small industrial town and the power of their friendship as they grow up. I've seen the TV movie too when I was twelve years old but the movie only left me confused. The book is much longer and more detailed, giving an explanation to what exactly the shapeshifting clown boogeyman is and why it chose Derry's sewers to reside in. IT is full of of childhood nostalgia but also plays with common childhood fears, from a boy who encounters a homeless man under his porch to a boy who watched Return of the Mummy in the theater. The characters were all original and likeable in their own way (except for Henry Bowers and his group). King obviously put a lot of time into this huge book and it's one that any horror fan should add to their reading list. After all, it's got everything from evil clowns to old school memories.

The words were leaking crimson [Wake up] and I screamed as I started falling into a bottomless oblivion....Oh, hi there! You just read about one of my nightmares I had since I started reading this book. Oddly enough, I didn't dream about clowns. (Probably because I am not scared of them. The only clowns we have here are Macdonald's!) But I saw a lot of blood in my dreams.... A lot.How does your mind work, Mr. King? And How are you doing this to me?!Welcome to Derry, Folks. A town famous for its history, culture and it's Jubilant citizens. Come join us! (here on this killing floor). The party is just about to begin! (and you'll float tooooooo). As our special guest, you'll be staying here for two summers: Summer of 1958 and 1985! Oh, please remember that the curfew starts at 7 PM for both years. Some of the children went missing (Dead and mutilated) in town. Yes, we found some... bodies. (Ripped into pieces) The police believe it might be an outsider, an unstable vagabond probably. (What about the clown?) The matter will be resolved any day now! You don't have to worry about anything as long as you are a grown up!But the children aren't safe. Because they can see..... It. And It hunts them.This is a grand and ambitious tale. I am not just talking about the length, but the sheer magnitude of the narrative. It is simply incredible. King manages to interwoven the two timeliness, multiple incidents and an array of characters to deliver something unique... Something sinister. The characterization of the wide cast is beautifully done as usual. The story offers straight out horror rather than terror most of the time. And there were many well written moments which made me swear out loud like a sailor. (Coping mechanism)But I wouldn't call this book perfect. It came close, but there were flaws.One of the reasons for this opinion is the amount of trivial information King throws at us. I know that's what makes King's writing style special and for most of the part, it makes the story feel too damn real. But there are times when it simply drags.Also, just before the ending, the story went a bit weird. When the story presented the idea of IT's origin, I was blown away! But when King started to lean into that idea at around 90% mark, It started to feel a bit odd. So there, I'm not a fan of the five percentage of the story between 90 and 95%.Having said that, The number of memorable moments outnumber the other moments by a wide margin. And some of the best parts are not even about IT. It's about friendship, bravery and human nature. A mother's over-protectiveness towards her child, A brother's grief, A bully's journey for vengeance and a bunch of losers finding strength in each other.That's why Stephen King will always be the King of horror for me. Because his stories are not just about horror.-------------------------------I think I'll never look at the word IT same.DammIT. -------------------------------First Update I think I just got traumatized for life after watching \nTHIS PHENOMENAL TEASER TRAILER.\nNeedless to say, I am waiting for the delivery guy to ring the doorbell!(Or the delivery truck to unload a crate.

Eleven years old is far too damn young for such activity. I agree. It's hard for even me to read. But, and this is a mighty large \"but\", I understand the necessity of Bev's actions. To break It's spell on them, the loser's club had to grow up, they had to \"come of age\" quickly, and the scene goes down the way it does. Like I said, I don't enjoy or condone the scene, but I understand it. Next, I'm honestly quite shocked that so many people believe that It's final form is a spider. It's stated over and over again that It's final form is actually the deadlights, that cold ball of orange light cast off at the edge of oblivion. The spider is only the form in which It has been caught in. Even in It's final chapter, It thinks about how stupid it was to trap itself in a physical form, and how that action would be its downfall. I don't think that half the people who have reviewed this book on Amazon and Goodreads actually finished the novel. I believe most of them watched the movie and called it enough. Now on to the last complaint most people have with this book. It ties directly into the Dark Tower series. You have mentions of the Beam and the Wheel, and, of course, you have the Turtle. If you have not read the Dark Tower series, all of this shit will go right over your head. I feel for ya, I do. King's a jerk (a talented jerk, mind you) for doing such. I think Stephen King firmly believes every person who reads his work will either eventually reread every novel, or read them in chronological order. Final bit of business; conspiracy theory time. As far as I know, no one else has come across these things, so I could be on to something, or completely fucking insane. Dig on this:Pennywise first introduces himself to Georgie as Pennywise the Dancing Clown, or, if you will, Mr. Bob Gray. The \"grays\" are King's aliens. The aliens in The Tommyknockers are not called Grays, but we're in the King verse and everything comes together eventually. The Grays are finally called as much in Dreamcatcher. In the chapter The Smokehouse in It, Ritchie and Mike see It crash land from somewhere. Not outer space, they feel, but somewhere else. In The Tommyknockers and Dreamcatcher, King never tells us where the Grays came from. So here's my theory. The Grays are the Old Ones from the Dark Tower series. King never discusses the Old Ones other than to say that they were a technologically advanced race of beings. Once again, I may be wrong, but it's something worth considering.

It will be the last time anyone sees George alive- his death being the first of several child murders and disappearances in Derry.Several months later- a group of children are drawn together after being bullied by- Henry Bowers and his lackeys- to form the Losers Club:Bill Denbrough- The leader/plannerRichie Tozier- The goofballEddie Kaspbrak- The frail sickly oneBen Hanscom- The builderBeverly Marsh- The tomboy Stan Uris- The skepticMike Hanlon- The last to join ...and being bullied isn't the only thing this group of seven find they have in common- they have also had strange and frightening experiences that seem unbelievable -until they all come together and share their stories about \"IT\" with one another. IT must be stopped- and they will be the ones to do it.Swear to me. Swear to me that if IT isn't dead you'll all come back.July 1984- Derry, Maine- IT starts happening again and The Loser Club return to try to stop IT once and for all...27 years ago I read IT for the first time...and even though I absolutely loved IT then- there was something about going back and reading IT now that I am old...er- that made IT seem more special- the friendships even more sweet and pure. ...and FYI- I swear I didn't plan out/or do the math- to read IT the second time at the 27 year mark- IT just happened that way by accident.

It's terrifying, it's sweet, it's disturbing, it's sad. But most of all, It is amazing!The town of Derry is haunted by an evil with thousands of faces. With the entire town caught in the horrible creature's grasp, some of the residents are forced to confront their greatest nightmares, while others are forced to become the nightmares! Many years ago, a group of seven outcast children believed they had discovered the secret to ridding Derry of the terrible monster they knew only as \"It\". But when the murders start again 28 years later, they realize they were wrong. Now, the former \"Losers' Club\" returns to Derry to finish what they started, but there's one major problem...this time, It's ready for them!This book has been on my \"I've gotta check that out someday\" list for years! I heard amazing things about it, but I wasn't sure if it had anything new to offer me, as I was under the impression that it was basically 1,000+ pages of people being terrorized by a clown. Let's fact it, If you've known me for more than five minutes, chances are you've already heard me talking about Batman, which means you know I've already read plenty about a certain scary clown...(NOTE: The term \"clown\" could also be used to describe whoever greenlit that god-awful George Clooney \"Batman and Robin\" travesty!)But I'm glad I finally gave this book a chance, because it's about more than just pop-culture phenomenon Pennywise the Clown. Soooooo much more! Yes, this book is primarily a horror novel, and Stephen King's imagination is at full force in this one. He never runs out of creative ways to make readers afraid to turn the page, yet also enthralled enough to brave forward. But there's also a lot of depth to this story, as well. I was very impressed with the amount of detail King explored in the lives of the 7 self-proclaimed \"losers\". Each of the seven is flawed but likeable. Each of them have their own distinct personalities and they have all had to cope with their own unique tragedies. The way King goes back and forth between childhood and adulthood, and the way all of them tell certain chapters through their own points of view, I was reminded of George R. R. Martin's masterful storytelling technique in his epic \"A Song Of Ice And Fire\" series. I was also impressed by how King explored so many themes throughout the novel. The flashback sequences really capture both the magic and horrors of childhood. The bond that quickly grows between the Losers' Club is very heart-warming, and there are many sweet and tender moments throughout. But they also have to cope with terrible things, like abuse, alienation and bullying. And the present-day sequences are very effective as well, as they illustrate how our childhoods often shape who we become as adults. And while there is certainly plenty of supernatural horror to be found in these pages, King is at his most effective when he explores real-life horror! Spousal abuse, racism, homophobia, anti-Semitism, all these things are present in the story, and they are much more disturbing than any of the ghosts or movie monsters that show up. King makes a powerful statement on how real-life people whose minds are poisoned by hatred and prejudice are far more terrifying than any book that sits on the horror shelves!Throughout most of this book, I only had one minor quibble, and that was in regards to how much detail King provided in the backstories. Yes, I understand how pacing works, and obviously, if scary things happen on every single page, they quickly lose their impact, so I could appreciate what King was going for. But I still felt too many segments dragged at parts. Mike Hanlon's sequences particularly suffer from this...one flashback involving him and his father driving together meandered so long, I was ready to scream, \"They were close, Stephen, we get it!!!\" But even though the pacing could be plodding at times, the book was still so good that I was ready to give it five stars......until I got to the climax!Okay, I get that after a thousand pages of build-up, it's going to be really hard for any kind of pay-off to fulfill expectations. But that doesn't change the fact that the final battle with It just felt silly and out of place. It's hard for me to get specific about why I was so disappointed with the climax without breaking my strict \"no-spoilers\" policy, so I'll just leave it at this...after 1,000 pages of true horror, the book suddenly changes gears towards the end, and at which point King seems to be trying to emulate Douglas Adams' \"comical science-fiction\" style of writing (and failing miserably). The final battle wasn't bad enough to ruin the book for me, but it did cause me to deduct a star.Still, even though it loses its way towards the end, this book is highly recommended for anyone who loves horror, as well as for anyone who is looking for a powerful, complex story and doesn't mind being terrified and disturbed throughout. Although I do have one other minor complaint about the book...really Stephen, did you HAVE to name an unlikable character \"Koontz\"?!?"}, {"userName": "Councillor", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40792319-councillor", "userReview": "[this book included one important sex scene, one which was completely senseless, didn't add anything to the story and only disgusted and deterred me more than Pennywise was ever able to in this book. I can deal with repugnant scenes, as long as they can be logically explained, feel as if they developed naturally out of the story and add some layers to the plot. Nothing of those three aspects was the case here. The scene can be read in a symbolic way as the end of their childish innocence, and for Beverly as her reclaiming her power over her own character. However, King explained it as if the children had to be brought together to defeat IT, and can someone please enlighten me why this had to be done in the form a gang bang between 12-year-olds?

Sure he kills children and some occasional adults, but people of Derry, Maine do not seem to mind. Some of them actually love his presence.In the year 1958 several misfits from a Derry school managed to avoid Pennywise siren song and being rejected by all cool kids formed the friendship they dubbed The Losers Club. They were losers from a normal kid's point of view: one stuttered, another was fat (I believe the modern politically correct term is \"curvy\"), another was a Jew (in a town consisting mostly of rednecks), another was black (remember: rednecks), another had really bad eyesight, another had all kinds of health problems (real and imaginary), and the last one was a girl from a poor family and a tomboy to boot which made her a pariah among the rest of the schoolgirls. As I mentioned, all were losers no cool kid would want to touch with a 10-feet pole. Fast forward to 1985. Pennywise is back to his old tricks again and the only member of the Losers Club remaining in Derry called the others back to deal with the problem one and for all - it seems they already faced Pennywise (or as they call the clown It) and lived to tell the tale, kind of. The grown-up Losers had to uncover some deeply buried memories. As you can guess the tale switches between the years of 1958 and 1985. To no surprise for me the children tale is miles ahead of the adults one when it comes to being interesting. This only confirms what I keep saying lately: being an adult is boring. If you do not believe me recall an average day you spent with your friends as a kid. Now recall your latest company meetings with high-ranking people showing you a Power Point presentation on the company's strategy with all the latest buzzwords. Now say the the latter is more fun than the former and keep a straight face. You failed? I thought so. Children tale talks about the power of friendship, facing your fears, standing up to bullies (this was the time when schools did not protect poor bullies by punishing the people trying to stand up to them, like in nowadays). Speaking about bullies these guys were hardcore in 1958 as Losers often had to literally run for their lives. Adult tale talks about the same subjects, but in more boring adult-like style. Please note that the year of 1985 is only boring compared to 1958; it is a very good tale on its own. After reading King's The Dark Tower and The Stand I became convinced that the guy cannot write a good ending even if his life depends on it. I dreaded the coming of this one, but now I have to say that he actually can do it - if he is in the right mood. Speaking about this: for the love of all that is holy please do not let him create an extended version of the book. It is perfectly fine as it is now. Any book that makes me lose a couple of hours of sleep every night I was reading it can be called a very good one. The Losers were great and King makes you care about every single one of them. The villains were even better. Speaking about villains please keep in mind the following: I admit there were times I was seriously tempted to subtract one star from a perfect rating. There were even (occasional) times I wanted to subtract two stars. In the end I decided the perfect rating is in order as all my problems with the book were not King's fault. It was the editor's fault who was asleep during the editing. Some parts practically begged to be cut off. Were they? Not at all. Imagine the following (this is taken from a middle part): a boy tries to outrun a monster who would love nothing more than to kill the former in the most gruesome ways. Suddenly the chase is interrupted by a 4-page(!) description of the places the boy runs through. By the time I was done with the descriptions I totally forgot about the poor boy's plight; the tension is completely and irreversibly broken. I even hoped the boy would be caught soon for the fear of him getting into another region followed by its endless description. I did not take any writing classes but I still understand that this is a way to mount the suspense: contrast the near death situation of a single person with the tranquility of the surroundings. However 4 pages of such tranquility is way too much. So thanks to a nameless editor who did not bother do properly do the job this otherwise excellent book almost did not get 5 stars from me. My final rating follows. King's work and the book itself: 5 stars. Editing: 1 star. P.S. I realized after watching too much news I was not scared by the scariest parts of the book even a little. Life is scarier than whatever Pennywise (and good citizens of Derry) can come up with. The book is still great. P.P.S. Tim Curry is great as Pennywise: please refer to the first picture. P.P.P.S.

In 1985, the clown is back and the kids return to Derry to finish what they started...Yeah, I'm a couple decades late to the party on this one. So what? Some friends were doing a group read and I decided it was time to tackle this kitten squisher.While it's a horror story, it's also about growing up and forgetting what it's like to be a kid. Stephen King does a great job at reminding me what it was like to hear noises in the night and fearing some monster is coming for you. In fact, It is the third Stephen King novel I've dreamed about while reading it, right up there with The Tommyknockers and the Dark Tower.The characters play well off each other and feel very real. It was all too easy to imagine playing in the barrens with the Losers or running from Henry Bowers and his gang.Having seen the mediocre TV miniseries from 1990, I was surprised by everything that was lost in translation. Lots more Pennywise in this, for one thing, and there was a lot more to the ending. As I've said in other reviews, even though I knew how things were going to turn out, King still had me on edge during some of the tense moments.In some ways, It felt like a trial run of some concepts that found their way into the Dark Tower. The kids were definitely a Ka-Tet and felt Gunslingerish. Also, the Turtle of amazing girth upon whose shell he holds the earth.My only gripe with the book was that I felt like it could have lost about 20% of the length and not lost a whole lot of story. There was a lot of extraneous crap. While some of it fleshed out Derry and made it feel real, some of it felt like no one had the guts to tell Sai King to cut it. In short, some places felt as bloated as a phone book left out in the rain. Was this the book where Stephen King went from \"Stephen King, very successful author\" to \"Stephen King, no editor shall dare command me!\"? This is either a high 3 or low 4.
