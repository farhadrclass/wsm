If these two books are any indication of the rest of his stuff then I have a lot of reading enjoyment ahead of me.Amos Decker is a brilliant character, a man with a perfect memory, imperfect social skills and no tact and yet is still very likable. I enjoyed his team mates too especially as they seem to understand him and let him be who he is. The book is immensely readable and the pages turn themselves. Occasionally I felt we did not really need to know exactly how every new character was dressed, whether his shirt was blue or green, button down or open neck etc. A very small issue though because the author's writing is like a very pleasant ramble on a fine day - you just keep on going and enjoying every moment.I hope Baldacci keeps on going too and that there are many more books in this series. I think there are a lot more stories left in Amos Decker."}, {"userName": "Bibi", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/33411728-bibi", "userReview": "Compulsive reading!"}, {"userName": "Luffy", "userReviewDate": "Nov 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7407364-luffy", "userReview": "The Last Mile's plot is rehashed, and many familiar ideas and objects are about this book right from the start. Baldacci being Baldacci, i.e the author whose thrillers have wowed me more often than not, takes these familiar things and gives them his own personal spin.Melvin Mars' case is rooted in violence in the South. He himself is a tragic figure. He could have made it to the NFL, but instead has been on death row for a case that has become a cold case. That's where Amos Decker steps in.I am used to the twists that abound in this book, and it was more satisfying than dizzying in keeping track of them. The average thriller can come in many shapes. But characterization is a tricky beast. Either too many characters whose names you can't remember, or too flat to care about, can be quite the anathema. Baldacci's balancing act made me give this book 4 stars. And they are well earned."}, {"userName": "Monnie", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6277675-monnie", "userReview": "It's for sure no one will ever accuse me of being a compliant little wifey-poo. Still, more often than not when I've got my nose in my Kindle and my husband pops up with, \"Honey, do we have more of yesterday's chocolate pudding?\" my response is something like, \"Let me finish this chapter and I'll go check.\"But when my nose is in a book like this one, my mouth sings a different tune: \"I can't see in the fridge from my chair, babe. If you find some, how about bringing me a bowl while you're up?\"Oh, yeah - this book is that good.Actually, it's the second in the author's new series that debuted last year featuring Amos Decker, whose promising NFL football career was derailed by a serious head injury during his first game for the Cleveland Browns (\"my\" team, BTW). As a result, he not only is able to remember every single detail of every single minute of every single day (a rare condition called hyperthymesia), but he associates many of them with vivid colors (an even more rare synesthia). That first book, Memory Man, was quite good, but this one jumped to the top of my enjoyment meter from the get-go. For the record, it stands on its own just fine, but I suggest starting at the beginning (as I do with any series).Football, in fact, that is the reason Decker, just picked to be on an FBI special task force, wants to take on a particular case. Melvin Mars, who's been in prison for 20 years after being convicted of murdering his parents, is set to be executed in a few hours. At the eleventh hour, another death-row prisoner confesses to the killing, and Mars gets a reprieve from walking \"the last mile\" to the chamber. Mars once beat the shoulder pads off of Decker when the latter was playing for The Ohio State University Buckeyes (go Bucks!) Not only that, but Decker's own family was murdered, and years after that, a suspect confessed. The similarities are impossible for Decker to overlook (well, let's be honest - given his condition, it's impossible for Decker to overlook much of anything), and he convinces the reluctant head of the FBI team to take on Mars's case.The stakes for getting to the truth are high; in one outcome, an innocent man could be executed. In another, a murderer could be set free. The trail begins, of course, with attempts to learn whether the prisoner's last-ditch confession is true and why he waited so long to make it. That's not an easy task since he's dead (choosing to go out, for some inexplicable reason, via the electric chair rather than the now-standard lethal injection). But guided by Decker's unfailing recollections and ability to not only find puzzle pieces but pull them together, team members uncover clues and follow where they lead. When one teamster suddenly disappears - presumed to have been kidnapped - things really start to heat up.There's no shortage of action and twists (and I'm patting myself on the back for figuring out one of the biggest ones). But the big attraction for me, without question, is Decker himself. I seriously doubt I'd like him much if I met him in person - for openers, his conditions have left him rather devoid of emotions - but watching [reading] how his mind works is absolutely fascinating to me. If I'm forced to say something on the negative side, I'll admit the plot (and outcome) smack a little bit of coming up with an ending and making the details fit after the fact. But hey: As stand-up accordion-toting comedian Judy Tenuta is fond of saying, \"It could happen!\"All I know is it sure worked for me. Kudos (and more, please)!"}, {"userName": "Jonetta", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4876540-jonetta", "userReview": "Originally posted on The Book NymphoAmos Decker is on his way to Washington, D. C. to join an FBI special task force headed by Ross Bogart. They'll be investigating cold and questionable cases. When he hears a news report about a former college football star who was on death row for murdering his parents and just escaped execution when someone suddenly confessed to the crime, it's no surprise that Decker wants this to be the first project of the task force. I loved this story from the start as every scene was compelling, interesting and provided something new to ponder. It went from being fairly uncomplicated to becoming a thing with so many tentacles that it tangled my brain in a good way. Decker's mind continues to be fascinating and the team dynamics suited his style perfectly. I also enjoyed the narration, which transitions between the two narrators every time there is a gender change during dialogue. Aside from helping with character distinction, it also livens up the performance. I'm committed to the audio format for this series. Literally, I couldn't stop listening to this book (even put my headphones on in the middle of the night). This is great storytelling with a very intriguing character in Decker at the forefront. It also has a strong supporting cast and I especially liked the man of focus in the investigation, Melvin Mars, who I couldn't help but root for throughout.

The plot is completely unbelievable and the characters might as well be wearing black or white hats to signify good or evil.

Thank you Hachette Book group for the free copy of The Last Mile. I enjoyed this book so much. I couldn't put it down. It had a lot of twists and turns,when I thought I had it figured out it would go a different way than the way I expected. I like when there's a lot of twist and turns and its not easy to figure out. I like that it continued where the last book left off. I love that Amos found a reason to live and to start taking better care of himself and that he found a purpose to help other people and to put the bad guys in prison and to get punished for there crimes. I just love Amos Decker and like the descriptions that David Baldacci gives of how Amos brain works after the injury he received from his first and last NFL game. Its interesting how he see colors and how he interacts with people. I think it so sad that Amos will never forget the details of finding his wife, his daughter and his brother in law dead when he got home from and how he can never forget it because of his brain injury he received. I also love the new character Melvin Mars. I enjoyed Amos and Melvin's relationship throughout the book. I love at the end of the book when Melvin told Amos that he was the best friend he ever and how Amos reacted to Melvin telling him that. That Amos said that Melvin telling him that he was his best friend topped his first and Last NFL game. I hope in the next book in the Amos Decker series that Melvin Mars shows up in it.

When I first got my hands on this book, I decided to take a look at it which is quite normal for me. I usually thumb through a new book taking note of the number of pages, font size and other basic attributes. My eyes landed on the first page of this book and I didn't come up fro air until I had read 100 pages. I hadn't planned to read this book quite yet but I simply couldn't put it down. Both the story and characters in this book were wonderfully done. Amos Decker is a very interesting character. He remembers everything...literally. At first, this sounds like it would be a fantastic trait to have but when you start to thing about it, there are things that are best forgotten. This book also featured Melvin Mars, a man on death row for the murder of his parents. While Melvin has always claimed his innocence, he starts being taken seriously when another made confesses to the crime. Amos feels compelled to find the truth regarding the crimes that have kept Melvin in jail for the past 20 years. Things get complicated as they trace the past to try to find the truth. Melvin works with the team to try to get to the truth since he has been released from jail. At times, things become very dangerous as they get closer to the answers that they are looking for.The way this story was laid out really kept me guessing. I was never quite sure exactly how everything would come together but I had faith that Amos would find the right piece of evidence to solve the case. The twists and turns in this book really kept me guessing and the book ended up in areas that I would have never dreamed. I would highly recommend this books to mystery fans. Amos Decker is a unique detective and love what his special abilities add to the story. This is the second book in the series but could be read a stand alone with little difficultly. I can't wait to see what case Amos will be asked to solve next!I received a review copy of this book from Grand Central Publishing for the purpose of providing an honest review.Initial ThoughtsWhen I first got my hands on this book, I decided to \"look\" at it....and didn't put it down for 100 pages.

On the one hand, I really like the character, Amos Decker. On the other hand, there were so many places that the characters were one dimensional and like something pulled from a bag of 'standard interchangeable actors' that the book lost some of its impact. I enjoyed the mystery and the idea of this convoluted cold case. However, I found the book to be a bit long winded and sprinkled with one too many implausible scenarios.

Now I'm very glad I did. I haven't read Memory Man, the first book in the series, but that didn't stop me from truly enjoying this book. I do however plan to read the first book some day. The Last Mile starts off with Melvin Mars in prison very soon to be executed for the murder of his parents, but in the last minute, another man steps forward claiming he's the one behind the murder. Amos Decker takes an interest in the case because there are similarities between his case and Mars. This all happened in the first book so all I know is that his family was killed and I bet Decker was accused of the murder. The big question is, what really happened 20 years ago when Mars parents were killed? Why would someone confess to the crime in the last minute? Decker wants to take on this case despite the fact that there isn't really a case to take since Mars is going free. Decker is simply want to know the truth.I found the book really compelling because the story took so many interesting turns that I never expected. I came to like the characters Mars, and Decker very much, and the story was truly intriguing. Especially when one started to finally understand what was really going on. At first, there was a lot of questions regarding the case (that wasn't a case but more a mission for Decker), and there were moments I feared for Mars life, especially since it wasn't even sure he would not be thrown in jail again. The book was thrilling and fascinating to read. I loved not knowing what was going on and just getting a piece of the puzzle now and then and the best part is when the whole picture started to take form and you read how Decker and the rest slowly getting to the truth. A truly remarkable good book! And, I love the last chapter, and especially the very last part of it!I want to thank the publisher for providing me with a free copy for an honest review!"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Feb 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/36199787-jim", "userReview": "I received an Advance Reading Copy of this book and was looking forward to it as David Baldacci is one of my favorite authors. This book picks up pretty much where Memory Man left off. While it may not be necessary to read this first it may help introduce Amos Decker and his situation.Melvin Mars is counting down the hours before his execution. Twenty years ago he was convicted in the violent killing of his parents. With only hours to spare before the execution someone else confesses. Amos Decker, newly hired on an FBI special task force, hears the story and is struck by the similarities in their stories. Both of them were talented football players with promising careers cut short. Both men's families were brutally murdered. And in each case another suspect came forward, years after the killing, to confess to the crime. Did the man who confessed to killing Melvin's parents actually commit the crime? It seems as though someone wants Melvin freed. Why? Why after twenty years? Amos's FBI task force take on the case. And in so doing they discover that there is more to the story than just the murder of Melvin Mars parents. Who were they? Why were they murdered? There are a lot of secrets and skeletons in the closet that some people would prefer stay that way. At any cost. This was a real page turner. One of those books where I kept telling myself that I would read just one more chapter and when I read that chapter I had to read one more because the author left you in suspense. Amos Decker is a terrific character. He has certain gifts but with these he has flaws too. If you enjoyed Memory Man I think you will enjoy this second outing."}, {"userName": "Rachel Hall", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/28372189-rachel-hall", "userReview": "After a decade long break from thriller writer, David Baldacci, my reunion with Memory Man was a rewarding experience despite all the usual provisos, caveats and ludicrously implausible scenarios. The good news is that Baldacci's latest uniquely talented former cop, Amos Decker, is once again leading the way, only this time he is less personally involved with the eventual fallout, thus making for more clarity of focus. Memory Man introduced the former college football player and one time cop Decker and told how a blindside hit altered his mind, leaving him with a perfect memory (hyperthymesia) and the phenomenon of synthesia, which in his case results in associating different colours with certain situations. The chances of such a medical miracle are the stuff of scientific studies and the mental advantages and improved processing power of Decker has been offset by a corresponding decrease in his social skills. In his first outing Decker set to work as a private investigator fixated on solving the brutal murder of his wife, Cassie, daughter, Molly and brother-in-law, Johnny. Along the way he hooked up with his former detective colleagues and aided the FBI in nailing a sadistic killer. His inability to relate to people and his awkwardness made him a character to vie for, with a big heart and pleasantly devoid of ulterior motives. The Last Mile sees Baldacci take things a step further with Decker becoming part of an unusual FBI task force based at Quantico which combines the myriad talents of FBI personnel and civilians with specialists skills ( Decker and journalist Alex Jamison). Headed up by Special Agent Ross Bogart, the remit is to reopen and hopefully solve cold cases and ahead of their first meet Decker's mixed feelings about his new career reflect his own difficulties adjusting to the loss of his family and moving on with his life.The Last Mile sees Decker go on something of a crusade into hijacking the permitted list of cold cases which Special Agent Bogart presents to the team for reopening. For Decker, a news broadcast detailing the last gasp reprieve of a former NFL college star and death row inmate, Melvin Mars, takes him back to his own sorry history. A dead cert to make his mark in the first draft of the NFL, Melvin Mars was twenty-two and on the brink of stardom only to be awoken one morning to the news of the brutal double murder of his parents, Roy and Lucinda Mars. Subsequently convicted of their murder and awaiting lethal injection, the last minute confession of Charles Montgomery in Alabama, a man who Mars has never heard of, sees him suddenly off death row and eventually pardoned. Given Montgomery's death row status, his confession appears baffling and presents a host of questions that astound Melvin and in turn Decker and his new team. It seems that someone wants Mars free after twenty-years inside and still bitter from the loss of his shot at the big league as a NFL professional it adds to his confusion of emotions. But who would do such a thing and why have they allowed Mars to lose twenty-years of his life? Decker can see similarities with his own personal situation and knowing that there is no bigger loss than that of your family he is impelled to take on Melvin's battle. Opting to not simply focus on the inconsistencies of the timeline which saw Mars convicted, Decker effectively re-investigates what could have caused Melvin's parents to be gunned down and their home then set on fire. Extracting memories from Melvin's past and some patient analysis sees Decker pull together the first threads in making sense of the mystery. When the rest of the task force gets cold feet and are recalled to HQ, Decker's refusal to give up forges a bond with Mars. I found The Last Mile a meaty read, less riddled with the layers of unlikely intricacies which I felt bogged down Memory Man into the finish. This follow-up is more straightforward, logically makes more sense and is thus wholeheartedly more believable. As it becomes clearer than ever that the task force are not welcome in rehashing old wounds, it seems that the death of Roy and Lucinda Mars holds a significance that somebody out there is prepared to kill to keep firmly buried. In Decker, Baldacci has moulded a character pleasantly free of political affiliations and with an emphasis on using his brain over brawn wherever he can. Admittedly Decker follows a fairly coherent route and this investigation would not be out of the ballpark for any solid detective or FBI agent, although it just might take them a hell of a lot longer and rack up a sizeable body count along the way!I tend to adhere to the school of thought that with high octane thrillers, you only get out what you are prepared to put in, and any depth of analysis taints the whole experience. For those who are prepared to lap up the plot, accept the cringeworthy situations and smile through the schmaltzy moments, The Last Mile is an engrossing tale from start to finish and introduces another compelling character in Melvin Mars, who certainly brings more to the party than the not so gifted journalist Alex Jamison. In truth, Decker is a one man show and given time could puzzle out most mysteries, but his interactions with Melvin give rise to his more emotional side. Ditch journalist Alex, keep Melvin Mars and let us await a third encounter with the intriguing memory man, Decker. In all honesty, the supporting cast and task force members are very interchangeable to my mind and contribute little to the process of investigation but I shall we ready and waiting for Decker to return!"}, {"userName": "Alex is The Romance Fox", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6663962-alex-is-the-romance-fox", "userReview": "The Last Mile, David Baldacci's 2nd book in his Amos Decker Series is a compelling and complex mystery filled with conspiracies, racial injustices and some pretty evil characters.I liked this book more than the 1st, The Memory Man https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2...The characters are well developed and Decker is desperate to saving a man on death row that he believes is innocent.

Melvin Mars sits on death row, awaiting execution for murdering his parents. As he prepares to walk 'the last mile', that distance from his cell to the execution chamber, a stay is granted. It appears as though someone in Alabama has confessed to the crime, leaving doubt that Mars may have committed the crime. This news hits the airwaves and Amos Decker seeks to take up the case. Working with a newly-established task force as part of the FBI, Decker discusses the similarities to the crime he was previously charged with, able to win over a majority of the team. As they head to Texas to investigate, Decker uses his unusual mental capabilities to unravel some of the facts missed by authorities. After the execution of said criminal in Alabama (who had been on death row himself for other crimes), everything seems to fall into place. However, an explosion kills a woman Decker has been interviewing about the case, forcing the team to wonder if there is more to the case than meets the eye. Mars recounts stories about how his parents sought to remain out of the limelight under any circumstances, which begs questions of witness protection or a life in hiding. Decker pushes deeper and soon learns that there may be something questionable about the murders of Mars' parents, where identities do not match official records. As the previously cut and dry case unravels, Decker, Mars, and the rest of the task force are pushed into the middle of a massive cover-up that spans decades. While escaping death in Texas before, Mars may still be executed by a vindictive group set on burying the past and its ghosts. Another great thriller that keeps the reader wondering until the very end!Baldacci has successfully been juggling a few series, keeping his readers from getting bored. The Amos Decker series could prove to be very interesting, as the 'powers' offer cases a new edge and keeps the reader from sensing anything too repetitive. Baldacci introduces the idea of the FBI task force, which could also inject a collection of new characters on which the stories can build and this can only bode well, as long as Baldacci does not let any of them wither on the vine. The story flows nicely and does touch on recurrent themes when the South plays a role in the setting and plot lines. Baldacci works with what he has and builds a wonderful story on it, keeping the reader guessing for at least part of the novel. Add to that, significant dialogue and the story pushes forward with ease, while also allowing some banter to develop his handful of characters. I look forward to seeing what else Baldacci has in store for Decker and if he will ever do some crossover work with his other protagonists, which can always make for some entertaining possibilities.Kudos, Mr. Baldacci for this piece of fiction that entertains as well as educates.

I was hooked with the way the story was unfolding. But I'm still torn between 3 and 4 stars on this one. This is the second book in the Amos Decker series by David Baldacci. It isn't my favorite series, but there is still plenty of things to like about it. I liked this book better than the first one in this series. Amos, as an MC, was portrayed as more 'normal' than in the last one. This one had him working with other people who were actually capable of adding to the fact finding and not merely as tools to make Amos look good (although, there was still some of that). His memory/brain injury was also handled so much better in this one, but he was still able to make some incredible leaps by skipping the steps that mere mortals (normal people with lower functioning brains) would need. No doubt, this author can write a great story with lots of twists and turns. He can also develop memorable characters. They grow and learn --- even the new ones. I love that, which is why he is my 'most read' author. There was one thing that was a little off putting. It was the dialogue in some places. It was feeling especially wordy and pointless, which surprised me since I'm not used to that from this author. The ending also seemed to also do some incredible leaping over reality and probability. I usually don't mind that, if it is linked to this world I've been asked to accept. I guess I didn't get that feel.

I WAS going to give this 4 stars until the last few pages and the very last line of this book. My heart melted a little and I seriously ended up loving this one. I ESPECIALLY loved these twists and turns even more from this book and I even had a theory come true! Haha it was all a matter of \"how\" and once it was revealed, I was super happy I actually got a book theory right with a character. Usually when I read Baldacci, I think one way and he turns completely around haha. Now I've read ALL Baldacci except his newest and latest one since it came out on the 15th this month (NO MANS LAND) I just need to wait for the audiobook on that one to show up from the library and then I'll be caught up! So this story was of course from the description had quite a few similarities and a few differences to MEMORY MAN but the twists and turns with the outcome of this was BRILLIANTLY executed and just so much fun to listen to. The only beef and disappointment I had with the audio with was no awesome (in a good way I promise lol) sound effects like gunshots, explosions, car chases, suspenseful music to make his action and suspense moments more fun. I was pissed on that one but still read amazingly by two great readers (they had a different guy for this one rand honestly liked him better for decker) and Baldacci really does get FANTASTIC readers for his books especially Orlagh Cassidy who's been doing the female voices for the last few years. She's AMAZING and so if you ever want to read a Baldacci book, try listening to one. He truly does get pretty good readers. This book overall, is all I can say is wow! Just WOW! TRULY not what I expected but loved this. And that end......oh my heart. Seriously oh man. I feel with the media industry he's underestimated BIG time and wish more movies were made from his books like Grisham and Crichton were. It's a true shame some of these or actually most of these books of his aren't films let alone tv series too. So I'd definitely recommend any Baldacci books to anyone who likes a good suspense thriller and one who likes stories with BIG climaxes where things definitely come together and make sense.

It shares some common themes with John Grisham's 'The Chamber' but I consider 'The Last Mile' to be the better book. Amos Decker and team are great in this book with plenty of development as far Amos is concerned. His struggle to get past his disability to connect with other people is very well portrayed. The Last Mile has the right mix of pathos, humour and action. This is a book that is hard to put down."}, {"userName": "Rajan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11662595-rajan", "userReview": "0.5 stars Average read.

From the Camel Club series and King and Maxwell, to John Puller and Will Robie, Baldacci has no shortage of ideas or characters\u2013which is evident once again with his newest series about a man named Amos Decker. Decker is unlike any of Baldacci\u2019s other characters, made unique by an extremely rare neurological condition called hyperthymesia\u2013the result of a crushing helmet-to-helmet hit on the football field, which makes it impossible for Amos to forget anything. While the idea of being able to vividly remember everything sounds awesome at first, in Decker\u2019s case it\u2019s also a curse.Nearly twenty years after his NFL career ended, Decker, now a police detective, returned home to find his wife, young daughter, and brother-in-law brutally murdered. Unable to forget even the smallest of details from that night, he\u2019s haunted and tortured by the loss of his family every single day. Those events take place in Baldacci\u2019s previous novel, Memory Man, which came out last year\u2013but also play a role in this year\u2019s The Last Mile.Note: While reading Memory Man will provide more insight and a deeper understanding of who Amos Decker is, it\u2019s not necessary for understanding the plot of The Last Mile. THE STORYMelvin Mars, nicknamed \u201cJumbo\u201d by prison guards because he happens to be inmate number 7-4-7, is awaiting the death penalty after being convicted of murdering his father and mother nearly two decades prior. At the time, Mars was a Heisman Trophy finalist, and the top-ranked running back leading up to the NFL Draft. He had his whole life and career in front of him. Then it was gone.Now, Mars has made peace with his life and the fact that it was soon coming to an end. A creature of habit, he still maintains his body by performing a strict and grueling workout routine each day in his cell. On the night of his execution, Mars planned to walk what\u2019s known as \u2018the last mile,\u2019 which is actually just thirty feet, to the execution chamber with his head held high. He tells himself dying will be just like going to sleep, without ever waking up. He\u2019s no longer afraid, but rather he\u2019s accepted his fate\u2026 and then a miracle happens. Just before his execution is scheduled to begin, officials escort him from his small Texas cell to a much bigger room. There, Mars is informed that a man on death row in Alabama has confessed to murdering Mars\u2019 parents. But before his confession can exonerate Mars, an investigation must first confirm the man\u2019s claims. Until then, Melvin Mars has to go back to his cell and wait. Amos Decker has just taken a job with the FBI to serve on a newly assembled team of agents and civilians with unique traits who, together, will re-open and investigate cold cases. He\u2019s still in the process of moving to the East Coast when he first hears about Mars\u2019 situation in Texas, and immediately remembers the former Texas Longhorn from his own playing days at Ohio State University. Furthermore, Decker is intrigued by several parallels between himself and Mars: Both were collegiate football players for major universities, both had their playing careers cut short, both had their lives ruined after their families were murdered, and in both cases, someone came forward to confess to the killings after an extended period of time. After he was settled into his new apartment and met his team members, Decker lobbied hard for them to take a look into Mars\u2019 case, which they do. The investigation seems straightforward enough, until one of the team members turns up missing as a result of their poking around. Soon things begin to unravel as Decker races to answer a series of questions, including who might want to help free Melvin Mars, and why. The Last Mile is a serious step up from last year\u2019s Memory Man, which I personally didn\u2019t love. While I still prefer both Will Robie and John Puller, I have to admit that Baldacci has progressed and developed Amos Decker quite well in his second book, and I\u2019m very intrigued to see where he takes the character next. WHY I LOVED ITBecause I wasn\u2019t so high on Memory Man, I started this book thinking I probably wouldn\u2019t really get into it. Instead, I found myself thoroughly drawn into the characters and the plot. I enjoy Baldacci\u2019s writing and am a huge fan of his Will Robie series, so in hindsight, it was stupid to doubt him coming into this book. He definitely did a lot to add layers to Decker, which makes him more compelling and interesting to follow. Also, I know they say to \u201cnever judge a book by its cover,\u201d but the cover for The Last Mile is fantastic! Seriously, this is a great-looking, attractive cover with rich colors and an appealing design. If that\u2019s the kind of thing that matters to you, this will look great on your shelf. WHY YOU SHOULD READ ITDavid Baldacci has sold more than 110 million copies of his books around the world. That doesn\u2019t happen by luck, accident, or chance\u2013he\u2019s one of the most famous and bestselling novelists alive today for a reason. He has a ton of talent, with little to no weaknesses in his writing. Solid from top to bottom, with a near-perfect understanding of how to tell a story, Baldacci is a blistering force in the world of thrillers. If you aren\u2019t reading his stuff, you should be!"}, {"userName": "Judy Collins", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/11063006-judy-collins", "userReview": "David Baldacci  returns following (2015)  Memory Man,  landing on my  Top 10 Books of 2015  where we met an unforgettable man, Amos Decker.

Consequently, Decker now possesses an infallible memory: he can replay moments of his life, scene-by-scene; whatever he hears, reads or witnesses, he remembers \u2014 which means the details of the brazen murders of his wife and child will never fade. In Memory Man, Decker finally solved the case that tore apart his life, and was subsequently offered an opportunity to join an elite FBI task force focused on cold cases. He took it: and The Last Mile centres around that task force\u2019s first case.Convicted murder Melvin Mars is counting down his final hours. Twenty years ago he was accused of the brutal killing of his parents, and he recently lost his final appeal. The end is nigh. But at the very last moment, another man confesses to the crime, and Mars is released. But with the best years of his life vanquished \u2014 years he would\u2019ve spent in the NFL, for he was destined to be a star \u2014 he doesn\u2019t have much left to live for . . . besides understanding what truly happened the night his parents were murdered. Enter: Amos Decker and his Quantico comrades, including Special Agent Ross Bogart, journalist Alexandra Jamison, FBI field agent Todd Milligan, and clinical psychologist Lisa Davenport. Their unit has agreed that something about Melvin\u2019s case doesn\u2019t add up \u2013 but when the ramifications of decades-old racial prejudices come to light, and the killing starts, it\u2019s clear the fledging task force might\u2019ve bitten off more than it can chew. The Last Mile is a sufficiently compelling mystery, laced with implausible scenarios, but packaged for maximum readability. While much of the dialogue is stilted (and lacking any sort of nuance), and too many of the characters lack any sort of personality, the layered plot and its countless red herrings ensure readers will be turning the pages into the wee hours of the morning. As a mystery novel, it is serviceable; as an Amos Decker novel, it\u2019s disappointing, simply because his maximised brain power rarely gets a chance to shine. Melvin Mars\u2019s case is solved more through traditional detective work than Decker\u2019s uncanny recall \u2014 so why make Decker the protagonist in the first place? Why not keep the character in reserve for specific storylines that necessitate peerless memory? Still, millions of readers can\u2019t be wrong, and Baldacci\u2019s latest will doubtless be enjoyed by his die-hard fans and those looking for an easy, uncomplicated yarn. For the rest of us though, The Last Mile doesn\u2019t do enough to separate itself from an increasingly crowded market. Ultimately, it\u2019s readable, but forgettable. Baldacci\u2019s got plenty of talent, but it feels like his increased output is diluting the quality of his work. That said, I\u2019ll cross my fingers, and hope for a return to form in his next, because all misgivings aside, I remain one of his faithful millions of readers."}, {"userName": "Mahoghani 23", "userReviewDate": "Nov 28, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22091363-mahoghani-23", "userReview": "A heisman nominee, a murderer and a death row inmate has one thing in common; Melvin Mars.

He's always proclaimed his innocence but the courts found him guilty & with all appeals filed, today's the day that he's going to get the lethal injection. At almost the very last minute, he receives a reprieve because of Charles Montgomery. He's an inmate on death row in Alabama and he's claiming that he killed Melvin's parents.

As they get closer to one answer a new question arises. There's action, suspense, drama, heartache, death, mystery, politics and the 10 elements needed to keep the readers' attention.
