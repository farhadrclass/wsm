This was my first book set in a Amish setting. Overall I enjoyed it. However i just felt like it was missing depth. The characters were a little too flat for my liking and the story was just ok. The suspense element was ok although I found it a little bit predictable personally. My favourite character was charity and I did like the faith element to this story. Although I am not in a rush to complete this series I do plan to at some point in the future. As this was my first book by Nancy Mehl I do want to read more books written by her in the future as I think you can not judge an author by one book. Recommended for those who like Amish settings or if your looking for a sweet simple read :)."}, {"userName": "Loraine", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1922494-loraine", "userReview": "SUMMARY: Lizzie Engel is used to running away. At eighteen, she left her Mennonite hometown, Kingdom, Kansas, with plans never to return. But five years later, the new life she built is falling apart. Lizzie knows she's being followed, and she's certain the same mysterious stranger is behind the threatening letters she's received. Realizing she'll have to run again, the only escape Lizzie can manage is a return to the last place she wants to go.Once she arrives in Kingdom, Lizzie is confident she'll be safe until she comes up with a new plan. In reacquainting herself with the town and its people--especially her old friend, Noah Housler--she wonders if she judged her hometown and her Mennonite faith too harshly. However, just as she begins to come to terms with her roots, Lizzie is horrified to discover the danger she ran from is closer than ever. No longer sure who to trust and fearful for her life and the lives of those around her, Lizzie finds she has only one place left to run--to the Father whose love is inescapable. REVIEW: After many years of reading Amish/plain people novels, I began to find them all beginning to be somewhat formulaic. Several authors have branched into suspense novels based on these sects, and I have found them much more interesting. This one focuses on a small group of Mennonites who have formed a town \"hidden away from the world\" in Kansas. Lizzie returns there with her daughter after feeling she is being stalked. She finds herself in a world that is divided in two between those who want to move somewhat into the more modern world and who focus on God's love, grace and forgiveness and those who want to remain (including Lizzie's father) secluded, old-fashioned, and depending on God's justice and punishment. Mehl does an excellent job of displaying the feelings of both sides through the characters in her story. Her research into the Mennonite sect is well done and adds to the storyline. I found the mystery somewhat easy to figure out but it still kept my interest. I loved the relationship of Lizzie with her mother, Ruby and Cora; and I found the developing interest between Lizzie and Noah sweet. Her confusion about God is understandable after being raised by her strict, harsh, seeming uncaring father.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes Vanetta Chapman's Amish mysteries and look forward to reading Book 2 in the Road to Kingdom series.FAVORITE QUOTES: \"I don't intend to allow anyone except the Holy Spirit to tell me how to run my life. I've discovered God loves me just the way I am...He cares about my heart.\"\"Maybe trying to keep the peace isn't the best thing after all. Standing up for what is right is more important sometimes.\"\"She will know that in a world where babies are so casually torn out of their mother's womb, a place that should be the safest place in the world for them, her mother bore her, took care of her, and loved her with a great and Godly love.\""}, {"userName": "Olivia", "userReviewDate": "Jan 19, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/43582060-olivia", "userReview": "[Lizzie kissed both Caleb and Noah.

That was a bit of a letdown for me, because I enjoyed the suspenseful plot line more than the small town plot line. I also felt that the showdown with the stalker was resolved way too quickly.

Upon getting pregnant out-of-wedlock, he seemed even harsher toward her. She felt judged by the whole Mennonite community. So she did what she felt was the only thing to do, leave and make a new life in Kansas City. Five years later, however, her new life there is falling apart with allegations of theft and a stalker with threatening letters.Lizzie returns to Kingdom with her daughter, Charity, with great trepidation. Would they be accepted by her father and mother and those she was close to? When she arrives, except for her father, she finds the people friendly and kind, open to helping her get reestablished. She wonders who was more judgmental. She begins to feel safe here from her stalker, and reacquaints herself with her old friend, Noah Housler.When the stalker finds her, she realizes she has no where else to run except to her real Father. The author wove God\u2019s unconditional love into Lizzie\u2019s story in such a way that it opened up her heart to be less judgmental and more forgiving. But she does wonder if she is putting the community in danger by staying in Kingdom.I enjoyed Nancy\u2019s full-bodied characters. All the characters\u2019 quirks and endearments stood out for you to get to know them intimately. The harsh situations were difficult to deal with at times, but the reactions were in character. The danger was felt as the stalker returned. The suspense was charged when they found him later on. I found myself worrying about Lizzie and Charity when I broke to eat because they seemed so real.Charity and Cora became my favorite characters. Cora was her own woman. She didn\u2019t worry that much about what the elders thought of her restaurant and car. Charity was precocious, yet innocently bold in asking the hard questions or telling it like it is.For a genuine read about the difficulties of life, a love that never fails, suspense that keeps you intrigued, and insight into the changes in the Mennonite life, Nancy Mehl\u2019s book, Inescapable, is a great book to pick up and read!This book was provided free in exchange for my honest review from Amy Lathrop and Christen Krumm of the Litfuse Bog Tour.

She leaves her daughter alone in the apartment to get her mail...alone...which is located outside...which is where the \"stalker\" has been lurking for a very long time...gets another threatening letter...instead of running inside and locking her door, she proceeds to read it OUTSIDE in the snow, sees that it is threatening...again...looks up to see her stalker lurking in the same spot and THEN instead of running inside, she steps off the curb to scream at the guy and gets hit by a car- is actually knocked unconscious -yet is perfectly fine and doesn't want medical attention. Why? Because she's not sure if getting fired for embezzlement from her job would disqualify her from having benefits. What??? How is that confusing?!?! She no longer works there!!! That's when I turned it off. Maybe it gets better. I just don't care. Too many implausibles.PS. One more thing...her father is supposed to be devoutly religious...to the point of abuse...YET says \"I swear...something something something\" when she makes a stupid decision.

The characters were all beautifully drawn and very believable. I didn't really know much about the Mennonite community before reading the book, but it's obvious that Mrs Mehl does, as the whole situation felt authentic.

At eighteen she left her Mennonite hometown, her family, and her faith with plans never to return. Five year later, Lizzie finds she\u2019ll have to run again. False accusations at her job, a stalker, and a string of anonymous threatening letters have left her with no other options. This time, however, her escape is back to Kingdom, her hometown. As Lizzie becomes reacquainted with Kingdom, she realizes she may not have left her Mennonite roots and her faith as firmly in the past as she thought. She draws on the support of Noah Housler, an old friend as she hides out and attempts to plan her next steps. When it becomes painfully clear that the danger has followed Lizzie to Kingdom, suspicions and tension run high, and she no longer knows who to trust. With her life and the lives of those she love at risk, Lizzie will have to run one last time \u2013 to a Father whose love is inescapable. My Review:Lizzie Engel and her six-year-old daughter, Charity, live alone in a comfortable apartment but for the third night in a row, a strange man wearing a red baseball cap driving an orange car has been standing under a street light staring up at their window. Lizzie is terrified not knowing who this man is or what he wants. Lizzie has worked at harbor House for the past four years, a shelter for abused women but has been accused, falsely, of stealing over a thousand dollars by, Reba, one of the other workers there. Lizzie and Reba are the only two who have access to this money making it next to impossible for Lizzie to prove that she did not steal the money and Reba is temporary director so who is everyone going to believe \u2013 the director or a general worker? The only one who believes Lizzie is her friend, Meghan. The difficult thing is that Reba showed Lizzie the bogus withdrawals from petty cash that all seem to mysteriously have Lizzie\u2019s initials on them, but she knows she did not steal that money. The fact that Reba used to an accountant might go a long way in proving she\u2019d had years of practice doctoring records, at least that\u2019s what Meghan believes. Lizzie is worried that as a single Mom she could lose her daughter, Charity, if Reba goes to the authorities.Lizzie has also been receiving strange notes and doesn\u2019t know who they are from. She wonders if the man with red baseball cap who watches her apartment is sending them, or is it someone else? Between her trouble at work, the strange man, and the letters, Lizzie decides she needs to move, and she figures the safest place to go is back to Kingdom, Kansas her hometown of only 300 people. She is going to miss living in Kansas City. Really, the last place Lizzie wants to move back too is Kingdom, a small Mennonite community. Her memories of growing up there are far from happy. She had a father: \u201c\u2026who did nothing but use terror and intimidation to control me \u2013 and a mother too timid to stand up for her only child.\u201d Her grandmother used to tell her: \u201c\u2026there isn\u2019t anything too big for God, Lizzie Girl. You gotta cast your cares on Him. He loves you so much.\u201d Lizzie didn\u2019t and doesn\u2019t believe that for one minute, not after the way she was raised. Now that Lizzie and Charity were moving back to Kingdom, and not leaving a forwarding address or telling anyone, where she was going, they would both be safe! Or, would they?The evening before they were leaving, Lizzie ran downstairs in her apartment to retrieve the last of her mail. Inside was a blue envelope, she ripped it open and read: \u201cI\u2019m watching you. It\u2019s just a matter of time before I get you and your little girl. You\u2019ll never get away from me.\u201d Absolutely irate, she sees the man in the red baseball cap standing across the road and bolts out onto the road and begins yelling at him and gets hit by a car and knocked to the ground.Ms. Mehl has done a great job in writing this story.

Published by Bethany House Publishers, copyright 2012, it's twenty-five chapters that literally take the reader to another world. I loved the characters and Lizzie's daughter's name, Charity. I could identify with falling in love with a town and its wonderful people as well as a certain restaurant, and I loved the old restaurant and could just picture Lizzie's cozy apartment above it. In this wonderfully-woven tale, Elizabeth must make a choice between a boy she's known since childhood and the father of her daughter as well as a choice to remain in Kingdom or leave it for Seattle. She depends upon God for guidance with her decision. Set in a Mennonite town in Kansas, Kingdom is the place Lizzie ran from at eighteen and the place she runs back to five years later when her new life falls apart. On the verge of rebuilding a life in Kingdom, one she and Charity come to love, she finds herself facing a decision to run again, this time to Seattle with Clay. Yet, she knows her heart will remain in Kingdom with Noah. She'd do anything for her daughter, even forsake her own happiness. Charity sees Noah as the prince her mommy's waited for so long, but Lizzie can't help but think God has sent Clay back into her life to give Charity the father she wants and needs. Will Lizzie run from Kingdom again to Seattle with Clay, or will she stop running for once in her life? She's run from her problems since she was eighteen years old. Will she discover some problems are inescapable no matter how long and far she runs? What will God guide her to do in the end? Nancy Mehl has written a powerful story rich with detail into the way of life of a Mennonite town. Raised Baptist, I found it interesting to read of the beliefs and traditions, and I was able to identify with how changes in tradition can be hard to take, even when change can be for the best. From buggies to cars and trucks, from dark dresses and black head coverings to lighter ones, the author lets the reader become a part of the changes in lifestyle. I couldn't help but root for Lizzie's mother and was glad to see a change for the better in her life in the end and not just from an outhouse to an inside bathroom. An interesting read to say the least, and a great read that tells the tale of Lizzie's life as well as that of her mother's. For young women as well as grandmother's, there's heart-touching reading for all as Lizzie gradually finds her faith again."}, {"userName": "Tamara Tilley", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1383724-tamara-tilley", "userReview": "INESCAPABLE by Nancy Mehl was a pleasant surprise. I am not a fan of the Amish genre, and when I saw the buggy on the cover of this book, I thought, \u201cOh great, how did I accidently order this?\u201d But, I\u2019m glad I did. To clarify, this book is not set in the Amish community, but a Mennonite community; and was an entertaining story filled with romance and suspense.After an unplanned pregnancy at the age of eighteen, Lizzie Engel left Kingdom, Kansas, feeling shunned by the community and reviled by her father. Though it hasn\u2019t been easy, she\u2019s made a life for her and her daughter. But that life is now slowly falling apart. Accused of stealing money at her current job, she is fired; with the possibility of prosecution. But that is the least of her problems. Threatening letters, and a man stalking her, has Lizzie fearing for her daughter\u2019s safety. Feeling she has no choice, Lizzie does the one thing she vowed she would never do. She runs home to Kingdom.When her father refuses to accept her back, Lizzie gets a job at a local diner. Once back in Kingdom, Lizzie realizes a lot has changed. Many of the people she thought would shun her, accept her and her daughter; among them is Noah Housler. Noah, a childhood friend, expresses more than just a passing interest in Lizzie. And when Lizzie concedes to him the reason she is back in Kingdom, he vows to protect her. As Lizzie dares to dream that she and her daughter are safe in Kingdom, and maybe she and Noah could have a future together, she sees her stalker and realizes she\u2019s been followed. Now it\u2019s not only her daughter that\u2019s in danger, but all those she loves and cares about. I really enjoyed the approach Nancy Mehl took in INESCAPABLE. Having someone close to the conservative Mennonite community and a history with it, but not having to be entrenched in it, allowed the story to have so much more dimension than most stories in this genre. The characters were well written and likable. The tug-o-war Lizzie experiences with her suitors added to the depth of the story. I\u2019m glad I accidently ordered this book.

So, I was a bit hesitant to read Inescapable. This was also the first book by Mehl that I have read. I have to admit, I was pleasantly surprised-I REALLY enjoyed it. I know a lot of people will be put off by the first person point of view, but I actually enjoy them. I enjoyed the story line quite a bit. There were parts that were predictable though. I easily figured out who the \"bad guy\" was pretty early on. There were quite a few unexpected twists that kept me on my toes to make up for that. I also felt the ending was just a little rushed.As I am not normally a fan of the Amish/Mennonite genre, I was surprised by how much I enjoyed that aspect of the story line. I also liked how Mehl worked in the themes of forgiveness and mercy. I found the struggle between tradition and God's mercy to be intriguing. It was interesting to see how the older church members concentrated so much on God's judgement, almost to the point of losing the importance of God's loving mercy. This is something that I certainly see in the modern world as well. I also felt that Lizzie's struggle with forgiveness true to life. She doesn't feel God can forgive her for her past sins, as she struggles with forgiving her father for his harshness towards her.Overall, I really enjoyed Inescapable and am looking forward to reading more from Nancy Mehl. I am especially looking forward to reading more in the Road to Kingdom series.Disclosure of Material Connection: I received this book free from Bethany House in exchange for my honest review.

After finishing \"Inescapable\" I was so eager to find out if there were more Mehl books out there that I Googled it. In fact, Nancy has authored thirteen books total. Previously published by Barbour, Thorndike, and Greenbriar Book Company Nancy Mehl's new Road to Kingdom series has been picked up by Bethany House. If \"Inescapable\" is any indication, Bethany House made a very good call. I can't wait to see what Book 2, \"Unbreakable\" is about!Here, the main character, Lizzie Engel, has been gone from her Mennonite town for five years with good reason. She experienced violence and abuse at home and has no meaningful relationship with her parents. After becoming pregnant and treated with contempt by the townspeople, she left for a chance at life in the city. Lizzie planned never to come back, but when she is accused of theft and embezzlement at her workplace in Kansas City she needs a place to retreat. In addition, she's being followed and threatened. Lizzie can't afford to take chances with her daughter's safety, so she returns home to her Mennonite roots. Unfortunately, this doesn't fix anything, and the threats get even worse. Suddenly, two men enter her life as potential suitors and complicate everything for Lizzie. The entire book had me from page one, and I couldn't have enjoyed it more. I would compare this novel with something from Mindy Starns Clark. If you enjoy mystery with romance, this is a fantastic place to start. I wish the second book, \"Unbreakable\" was already out, but alas -- it will be released February 1, 2013.

The Christian message is very strong in this book, and it is woven so expertly into the fabric of the story. This book touched my heart as I read about how God restored everything in Lizzie's life (no spoilers--you have to read it yourself), and my faith is God was strengthened. I do not often find myself in tears as I get to the end of a book, but this one certainly did. The romance in the book was not \"put-on\"; it was real. Charity was the sweetest little girl in the world, and her faith was absolutely precious. When Lizzie had to make a choice, I was not sure what choice she would make, and I am so glad she made the right one.The mystery in this book was absolutely perfect. It took me a while to figure everything out, and I often found myself continuing to the next chapter when I should have been doing something else. I had to know what the outcome was.I was so happy to discover that there will be a sequel to this book. I definitely want to read \"the next chapter.\" These are some of the most delightful characters I have \"met\" in a while, and I could read several more volumes about them. I recommend this book highly to anyone who likes inspirational romances.I was sent a copy of this book in exchange for my honest review. I was not financially compensated, and all opinions are 100 percent mine."}, {"userName": "Faye", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6215055-faye", "userReview": "Well written characters stand out in Nancy Mehl's Inescapable.I really liked how this book had a strong main character in Lizzie Engel. She wasn't just strong, she was vulnerable to and I really admired her drive to protect her young daughter at all costs. All of the characters in this book were so well developed, it's impossible not to notice how much attention the author paid to making the characters so real, with a rawness to them that made them all the deeper. I liked how this book was written in first person from Lizzie's point of view, because she struck me as a character that would be hard to figure out if we couldn't get such an intimate view of her.The story was slow for me in a few parts, and the suspense side of it didn't really come to play till around the end. But that didn't bother me, because I'm not the biggest suspense fan any way and I liked the romance and the way that the many characters interacted with each other. I could see so much from just how they interacted.Overall this was a well written read that had it's lulls, but was for the most part a pretty good read. With many interesting characters. Plus a mystery! For this book was mostly about the characters and their ineractions, which were very well done!I received this book from the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

A single mother, determined to keep her daughter safe, Lizzie feels that she must return home to the strict Mennonite community that she ran away from years ago. They need a place to hide and the isolated community of Kingdom may be their only safe haven.Throughout the story, Lizzie struggles with trying to decide whom she can trust. When danger follows her back to her hometown, it is hard for Lizzie to know who to turn to. Is Clay, the father of her child, trustworthy? Or is her heart leading her to Noah? Which man truly loves her and will protect her?The author does a great job of weaving danger and suspense throughout this story, as well as taking Lizzie on a journey of self-discovery. After the harsh upbringing she experienced in her father's house, Lizzie has a lot to learn about forgiving herself and others, as well as learning that her heavenly Father is very different from her earthly one. I was blessed to win a free copy of this book from Bethany House. I was not required to write a review, however, I happily do so. I would recommend this book to lovers of suspense, Christian fiction and Christian romance. There is a bit of all three in there."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Aug 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1467086-becky", "userReview": "Anyone familiar with Christian fiction will wonder what rock I've been hiding under... but the truth is that Inescapable is the very first Amish or Mennonite book I've read. To my surprise, I thoroughly enjoyed the setting! In fact, getting to know the Mennonite town of Kingdom -- its residents and its ways -- was one of my favorite aspects of this novel.The story follows Lizzie, a single mom, who returns to her hometown to escape a stalker. She finds work for herself at the local cafe and strives to carve out a safe and secure life for herself and her daughter. There are threats to deal with, suitors to choose between, and relationships to heal. Lizzie's troubled relationship with her father was especially well written, imo. He was an extremely hard man, and I liked that author Nancy Mehl wrote him that way without flinching. Lizzie's difficulties with her father felt real and authentic. ...After all, there are some things in our lives that can only be fixed by God's grace. I appreciated that Lizzie's dad (and her feelings toward him) both fell into that category.Congrats, Nancy, on your first Bethany House book! Proud of you."}, {"userName": "Lynne Stringer", "userReviewDate": "Sep 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6895653-lynne-stringer", "userReview": "I did enjoy this book. It was entertaining, with a good message, and suspenseful. Although I was pretty sure which way it would go, I wasn't 100% sure. I do think that the final conversation in the book, though, was a bit laid back considering all that had happened. Certainly, when discussing those events, a bit of horror at what might have been would have seemed more realistic. Also, this was another book that seemed to skip over the resolution of the climax too quickly. Of course, being written in first person can create difficulties in those situations, but I felt restarting the story a bit sooner after the events would have been better, and perhaps not so much telling and more showing at that point."}, {"userName": "Kat", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6358333-kat", "userReview": "Suspenseful and intriguing read about Lizzie a girl from a mennonite town, who ran away after getting pregnant before marriage.

The writing was clean, and the story well-told. It didn't take me long to figure out who was sending threatening notes to Lizzie, which took a bit of the mystery out of the story for me. The reason behind them, however wasn't clear until the end of the book, and that kept me reading. My biggest issue was with Lizzie's six-year-old daughter, Charity. There were times her voice was that of a little girl, but other times, she appeared to sound much older. I know children are precocious, and often pick up on what older people say, but I didn't buy it at times, and was bothered by it. That said, I'm very much looking forward to Nancy Mehl's next book."}, {"userName": "Tom Elder", "userReviewDate": "Nov 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20353479-tom-elder", "userReview": "Nancy Mehl.

But it's not that simple and so we know something isn't quite right.This is a story which is unashamedly about following God. If you don't like that, then be aware before you start. While I myself have a strong faith in Christ, I approach books of this type with some reticence because I'm just not sure how to deal with the fact that, for the scope of the book, the author has become God. When the author sends horrendous trials and even a judgmental abusive father into this girl's life, I'm just not sure how to take that. It's not that I think God will protect everyone who believes from all evil in their lives. No, but I'm not comfortable with reconciling all the details of what He does allow with the way human authors do. I guess the way to put it is the clich\u00e9 which is also true - God works in mysterious ways. I certainly don't understand them and I'm glad that I don't. When I was done with this book, I was not overly uncomfortable with how the author handled God's interventions, but I also wasn't thrilled with the abuse Lizzie suffered.I found the story to ramble a bit between the various themes of mystery, romance and spiritual journey.
