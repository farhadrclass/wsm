I...LOVED...THIS...BOOK!!!This story was fantastic. The writing was superb and the plot marvelously creative. The characters were multi-layered, endearing, and wonderfully human. Unlike some of Banks's other books, the sex scenes were tastefully written and only moderately graphic. I love when authors include delightfully written children within the plot, and I found myself eagerly looking forward to the interactions between eight-year-old Crispen and Mairin, the heroine. Those endearing scenes became some of my favorites. I can not end this review without giving BIG kudos to Maya Banks. Typically, her main characters actually communicate and work together as a team. A quality sadly lacking in many romance novels. It was refreshing to read!!!Why did I wait so long to read one of Maya Banks's historical romances? That's a good question...they're simply fabulous."}, {"userName": "Zasha", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25255463-zasha", "userReview": "a really entertaining read,though the end for me felt sudden and quick. can someone tell me what happened to the bad guys cause i felt really like they didn't answer what happened to them."}, {"userName": "MelissaB", "userReviewDate": "Jul 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1320046-melissab", "userReview": "*** 4 1/2 stars ***In Bed with a Highlander was a great surprise! I really enjoyed reading this sweet and sexy Highland romance.Mairin has spent years at a nunnery because she is the illegitimate daughter of the former King of Scotland and has a generous dowry that would tempt men to force her into marriage. She is abducted from the nunnery by bad men loyal to Duncan Cameron, who tries to get her to marry him then beats her when she refuses to say her vows. Along the trip to Cameron lands, her kidnappers find a young boy who she takes under her wing. She escapes the Cameron holding along with young Crispin McCabe, who she helped to save from Cameron. The boy's family finds them, as they were out looking for the missing Crispin, and bring them to McCabe land where Mairin meets the intimidating Laird, Ewan McCabe who is the father of Crispin.Ewan McCabe is intrigued by the beautiful Mairin, who refuses to give her name or any information. But Ewan is a smart stubborn man and eventually figures out who she is. He proposes that she marry him because he is able to keep her safe from men like Cameron and can offer her a home and family. In return his clan will get her badly needed dowry. So their marriage starts out as a convenience but these two quickly start having deeper feelings for each other. Ewan enjoys his new wife's happy personality, though her impulsiveness gives him some heartburn. Mairin loves finally having a home, while Ewan's protective but caring actions help her fall for him.This was a really enjoyable romance! The tone really reminded me of Julie Garwood's The Secret, Ransom and Honor's Splendour, so if you are a fan of those I highly recommend it. I like the fact that there were no big misunderstandings or hurtful behavior, just a good love story about two people who appreciate each other. The story was really good, it really held my attention. I love that the heroine was a nice person, but she also would stand up for herself. Ewan was a good alpha hero who learned that it was okay to show softer feeling for his beloved wife. I loved seeing the progression of their feelings as they slowly fell for each other. The ending was really sweet, but I wanted an epilogue! The younger two McCabe brothers will be having their own stories soon and I am excited for them! For those afraid of this book because it's by Maya Banks, I would say it's nothing like her romantica books. The steam level is normal for mass market paperback - but still nice. I like her writing much better in this (and the KGI books) than her romantica, so give it a shot even if you don't like those.Highly recommended if you enjoy a good medieval Scottish romance!!"}, {"userName": "Carmen", "userReviewDate": "Dec 14, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25353295-carmen", "userReview": "When she was his wife, he'd take great delight in advising her of her duty to him and, most important, her obligation to obey him without question.Sigh. What a disappointment. I was so eager to read this book because I adored (ADORED) Banks' \"Montgomerys and Armstrongs\" trilogy, Never Seduce a Scot and Highlander Most Wanted. I loved Banks' kind, honorable, compassionate, and patient heroes. So I dived into In Bed With A Highlander expecting a real treat.Instead I got stuff like this:Misogynistic views, such as:\"She said nothing the entire time she was with you? Let nothing slip? Think, Alaric. She had to have said something. It simply isn't a woman's nature to be silent for prolonged periods of time.\"And\"There'll be plenty of time to see her face. Besides, 'tis not the face you need to concern yourself with. 'Tis the rest.\"Really? This is our hero? Are you serious? And I'm not talking about early in the book, okay, in case you are thinking, \"Oh, he just needs to be reformed.\" No. That second quote is from the 62% mark! By that time, even an \"asshole hero\" should know better....We also have a complete obsession on the hero's part in re: the heroine's obedience - and I'm NOT talking about in bed.\"You WILL obey me.\"and\"I am your laird, and you will obey me as everyone else here obeys me. Is that understood?\"and \"When I issue a summons, I expect you to heed it,\" he said. \"I expect - nay, I DEMAND - obedience. I won't accept defiance from you.\"Ew, really? Ugh. He also likes shutting her up, mostly by kissing her - but sometimes with hand-gagging:When she would have opened her mouth to dispute his assertion, he shocked her by clamping his hand over her mouth.\"You will be silent and allow me to finish.\"Unless you are enjoying a sexual game (which they were NOT), you just do not treat another person like this and disrespect them in that way. It's wrong. The fact that he just wants his wife to shut up all the time and has no desire to listen to what she wants to tell him is bad enough, hand-gagging her is atrocious. I can't forgive this....Then there's all this possessive crap.Lord, but she was sweet. Nay, bedding her would be no hardship at all. The image of her swollen with his child flickered through his mind, and he found himself very pleased with the image. Very pleased indeed.Ew, ew, ew.He was hard and aching. Want was fierce within him. There was nothing to prevent him from charging across the room, yanking her from the tub and laying her on the bed. She was his to take. From the moment she'd set foot on his lands, she was his. Whether she wanted him or not.Okay, two things. One: peeping Toms are disgusting. Not only is what you are doing (watching her bathe without her knowledge or permission) dishonorable, but it is very creepy, skeevy, and revolting. No one likes a peeping Tom.Two: Really? All women who \"set foot on\" your land are your property to do with what you wish? Really? And you're the laird of the clan? I can't believe anyone would let you lead if that is your attitude. You don't sound like a very good leader. You're just okay with raping someone? Really? You think raping people is your \"right?\" I can't even with this....Mairin is a virgin and he \"deflowers\" (hate that term) her in the most brutal way. (Keep in mind that she was badly beaten two or three days earlier.) I mean he just rips her wedding gown to shreds and plows into her. It takes two minutes and there was zero kissing, foreplay, anything. Ugh. Could you be more disgusting? I don't think so. He leaves her bleeding and sobbing on the bed. Do you expect me to forgive him for this shit?!?!?!? NO. I never forgave him. He didn't even feel guilty or bad about it!!!He finally starts caring that he might have hurt her or 'done the wrong thing' when she starts sleeping with his 6-year-old son in her bed to keep him away from her at night. He confronts her about it and she says,\"'Tis truth you've no skill at loving... 'Tis a well-known fact that a man is either skilled in matters of loving or matters of war. 'Tis obvious that fighting is your skill.\"Ewan winced. The little wench was shredding his manhood. His cock positively withered under her criticism.THAT'S when he decides that kissing and foreplay and good sex is worth his time, because he has to prove his manhood and he's insulted that she thinks he's bad in bed. Not, you know, because he should be loving and affectionate to his wife and care about whether she's enjoying herself or not. Good gravy, I can't BELIEVE that this guy is supposed to be the hero. He's a cretin....Is this book bad? Well, it's bad for ME. I hate bossy, demanding, possessive, ruthless heroes. I HATE THEM. I know they are super-popular right now, though, labeled as \"alpha\" and many readers swoon over them. So. If reading my quotes in this review and my status updates makes you excited instead of making you want to vomit -go for it! It's well-written for a romance book and Banks certainly knows how to make a book exciting and pull on your heartstrings. I think she was kind of going for a Julie Garwood-type of thing in this book - ditzy heroine who is 'cute and feisty, but like a kitten' and domineering hero who wants a slave, not a wife. You know the type of book. (Not dissing Garwood - she was my first romance novel ever!)If this kind of thing floats your boat - go for it! Banks is not a bad romance writer.If, however, you like men who are patient and merciful and into things like kissing, I would absolutely and wholeheartedly recommend Banks' other books, Highlander Most Wanted and Never Seduce a Scot. They are sweet, charming, and heartrending. Skip this drivel and go for the good stuff!ONE REAL STAR, ONE ROMANCE STARP.S. If you want to know what the actual plot is, Tessa Dare made THE CUTEST book trailer for this book - using Barbies and My Little Ponies!

She is also fiercely protective of the women and children. She pretty much starts a women's revolution. I have to approve of that! And, she's so bloodthirsty that I want to have lunch with her.After she completely decimates a guy who was threatening her and her husband is asking her what punishment he should give the guy:\n\"I think he should be fed to a pack of wild wolves.

Never a boring moment. I also really liked all of the side characters and am looking forward to their stories.

I thoroughly enjoyed this story with its twists and turns, wonderful characters, sweet romance and the steamy sex that Ms. Banks writes so well.The StoryThe story opens with Mairin Stewart being kidnapped from the nunnery she\u2019d spent most of her life hiding away in. The illegitimate daughter of the king, Mairin is heiress to strategic, prized land, and the man who marries her will make his Clan a force to be reckoned with, a power unlike any other. Duncan Cameron is determined to be that man.Laird Ewan McCabe, a widower, has spent years rebuilding his Clan after an attack that almost wiped them out. He wants nothing more than blood revenge against Duncan, the bastard who killed his father along with most of his Clan. When Ewan\u2019s young son, Crispen, goes missing, he sends out his brothers and his warriors to find him. What they find, however, is Crispen in the care of a bruised and bloodied but feisty, strong willed woman, a woman who might just be the salvation of the Clan, and the answer to all of Ewan\u2019s problems - if he can just open his heart and let her in.The Audio The narrator for this book, Kirsten Potter, has a lovely, rich, clear voice. I enjoyed her Scottish accent and the emotion and humor she gives to the characters and brings to the story. Her flow and pacing is well done and I\u2019m very impressed with how wonderfully she gives men, women, and children, unique and distinctive voices!The Bottom LineWhile I wish there had been more Scottish brogue and period dialog used in the story, I truly enjoyed In Bed with a Highlander. Whether you read the book or listen to it, it\u2019s fast paced, witty, sensual and poignant, and with Ms. Potter\u2019s narration, an absolutely engaging, entertaining read!

I was worried. Ewan lost a 1/2 point for their wedding night. But it was smooth sailing after that and I stayed up ridiculously late to finish it. Mairin was funny, brave and sweet. In the beginning she was so brave that I knew I was going to love her. While she skirted around a couple of \"stupid\" moments, I found her cute and was not frustrated.I loved that the nuns taught her about sex so she thought she should instruct her husband that he did not kiss properly! Or her learning about BJs...I can picture her face!Ewan was tough to take at times but I grew to love him. His adoration of his wife and son helped. I felt bad for his struggles, admired his tenacity and loved that he had no problem showing his affection for Mairin. His character was not quite as developed as Mairin and probably why I did not love him as much.Of course his son, Crispin (aged 8), was adorable. It was nice to see that these big tough warriors were so openly affectionate with the children.The fact that Ewan had a dead wife did not bother me one bit. He says he never thinks of her and mostly cannot even remember her (she has been gone about 8 years). They were childhood friends and married because their fathers told them to. They were not together long and Cripin never knew her. Ewan certainly cared for her, but his love for Mairin far surpasses that. Actually his lack of ever mentioning her was a little strange, but I was pleased.I listened to part of this on audio and I thought the narration was terrific. Safety Gang safe - only issues for some are dead spouse and some violence against the heroine by the bad guy.A note about historicals - I am so grossed out when I think about where these men get their sexual experience. In this book the men talk about tavern wenches and I am totally skeeved out thinking about their swapping fluids without protection. And I am not one to worry about condoms in books, but for some reason this bothers me. I guess because you know there are few women, lots of men and zero protection.

First off, the covers of this trilogy are amazing, not to mention they all feature the hottie that is Paul Marron. Cue swoons.But there is more! Banks introduces three McCabe brothers who are simply delicious. In Bed with a Highlander is Ewan McCabe\u2019s story. Ewan is the laird of his keep, where his brothers Alaric and Caelen are his second in command. While Ewan himself is strong and mighty, his keep and clan are not. They are dwindling in resources and food and a war is threatening to rise among clans.The book starts off with Mairin Stuart, the niece of King David, praying that her enemies do not find her. However, her prayers are not heard because Duncan\u2019s men find and capture her, bringing her unwillingly to his keep where he commands her to marry him. Mairin bears the crest of Alexander on her thigh, which was placed upon her at birth so that no one would ever mistake her identity. With a wealthy dowry and power, Duncan wishes to wed her immediately and consummate their marriage, thus gaining power and an advantage. But Mairin is a tough woman who doesn\u2019t go down easily. She fights with all her might, even using her body as a shield to cover a young eight-year old boy who had the unfortunate luck of crossing paths with Duncan.The young boy turns out to be Ewan McCabe\u2019s son and when Mairin and the boy escape Duncan\u2019s keep for McCabe\u2019s, that\u2019s when the story really begins...I was really surprised with how quick I read this book. Banks crafts an intriguing story with her strong characters and fast-paced dialogue. So much happens within the first few chapters that I didn\u2019t really have the chance to put the book down. It was that good.Mairin, for me, was the stand-out star. I loved her tenacity and wit. She seemed to never show fear, even in the face of Duncan who beat her mercilessly. And I have to admire a woman who is able to keep a man like Ewan on his toes. As a Laird, Ewan is certainly arrogant and is not used to being disobeyed. Mairin matches him well and while it took me awhile to get into the romance, it was all worth it in the end.I cannot wait for the next book in the series. Banks sets up Alaric\u2019s book perfectly in this one. Rionna is from the McDonald clan, a clan that had possible alliances with McCabe. And so, to strengthen that alliance, Gregor McDonald wishes for her daughter, Rionna to marry Alaric. I am dying to know how this plays out since Alaric isn\u2019t too keen on the idea of marriage and Rionna is a warrior herself.Bottom line?

I\u2019ll be honest, until now I instantly dismissed any Maya Banks book. After reading, (and not really liking), her erotic m\u00e9nage book \u2018Colters\u2019 Woman\u2019 a few years ago, I just knew she wasn\u2019t an author for me. But, never say never, right? Right. Despite so many of my online friends repeatedly saying her new series are great, that they are nothing like her earlier erotica stuff, I still held off reading them. But I love a good steamy highland novel, so last week I finally cracked and read this one. Wow, I so enjoyed it! I just picked up the rest of this series. It feels kind of odd to consider Maya Banks as a \u2018must read author\u2019, but that now seems to be the case. I\u2019ll also have to try her KGI series too. In Bed with a Highlander was a fast paced story where the heroine, Mairin, is the main pawn in a game of power, greed and revenge. After spending year in hiding for her own protection, she is kidnapped by a fierce enemy who plans to wed her for her massive dowry and land rights. After a grueling escape, she is taken to safety where she meets Ewan McCabe, laird of the McCabe clan. Knowing she must wed to protect herself and her land, Ewan seems like the right choice. I enjoyed this one quite a bit. The romance was passionate, sexy and always center to the story, while the action kept me guessing and guessing. There were several \u2018OMG, how are they going to get out of that?!\u2019 moments. The end was a bit rushed, but it worked for me. We meet Ewen\u2019s two brothers in the story, and I look forward to reading the Alaric\u2019s story next.

I've surpassed fangirldom and have nothing but pure appreciation for this book. It's 5:03 AM and though I have a busy day ahead of me, given I had even an iota of a chance, I would wholeheartedly start the next in the series. 5 Reasons everyone should LIE read In Bed with a Highlander1. The Heroine: MairinWhere do I start. Let's be honest ladies, I would say majority of the time a romance book's hero is what captures and keeps everyone's attention. That's why we have labels like TSTL for females and mostly positive labels like Alpha and Beta for the males. However, let me be the one to say right here, Mairin completely held her own. She was dynamic and engaging throughout the whole novel. Mairin is no uncoordinated, tripping, tstl lass. Instead, she is a beautiful, strapping, boyount, confident gem. While her consent to marry the laird seemed on the surface like her giving up. Don't be fooled, she was ready to wage a war on everyone's heart. She won the people over and her man through her integrity and willingness to sacrifice for the greater good. Banks wasted no time showing how wonderful Mairin. Her treatment of the Laird's child was above exaltation. She defended him and lived on for him like a true champion. She is in every way a true heroine. Plus, she had me laughing many a time with her blabbering mouth! She knew her place as a woman....and that is wherever she wanted it to be!2. The first Couple of chaptersHonestly, by the first page I was hooked. This book starts of intense and you get invested so fast. My heart was pounding and my blood was pumping as I read through the intense beginning of the novel. Maya Banks wastes none of your time getting into the meat of the story. Your villain is revealed early on as the story starts. Its a welcome change from the usually slow and super predictable starts of most historical romance novels.3. The hero:Ewan MacCabeOh alpha, where for art thou alpha. Let me just say Ewan MacCabe had me on a slow burn the WHOLE novel. He crockpott-ed my insatiable butt with all that slow cooking. Obviously, he is one hell of a hero if he has me sitting here typing like Paula Dean. This man is a loving father, fair and true laird, loving husband, and attentive brother. One thing that I never failed to notice, the whole novel Ewan was fighting for others. He fought to feed his clan, upkeep his crumbling keep, protect his son, aid his men, help his brothers, protect Mairin, and so much more. This guy didnt have a pot to piss in or a window to throw it out of and yet he fought for his people, i mean truly fought. They say desperation is the birth of ingeniuty. Ewan lived his life as if failure was not an option, however, with the weight of so many people's welfare upon his shoulder he assuredly knew the consequences if he did not succeed. In the end, when he was threatened with a starving clan and a dowry-less wife. He simply said , \"We will make it we always do, I'll find a way.\" That is a man. I loved him because he was not afraid to admit when he was wrong or fight when he was outnumbered. Easily, one of the top 5 heroes I've ever read. I have a bunch of quotes I had prepared to place in this description however, One really has to just read the book in its entirety to see what I mean. Favorite thing about him, yes he is alpha and no he is not a jerk. Jerk's have no place in romance. Ewan , however, will always have a place in romance.4. All the other loveeeely menCrispin, is Ewan's ever galliant and adorable son. He was a close contender to stealing the whole show I tell ya. Maya banks did a stellar job of writing about him as a child. I didn't feel like he was imposing upon the story, In fact I found myself constantly waiting for him to appear. He was awesome. Also, Ewan has two brothers: Alaric and Caedon. I CANNOT wait to read their books. They had important roles in this novel, but Maya Banks barely let us grasp the characters. She gave me just enough intrigue the hell out of me. It was nice, sometimes I get tired of tasteless hints about the following books when I read the first of a series. Banks did a very nice and stealth job of introducing the next two protagonists. 5.Last but certainly not least...STEAMWHEW, the sex was fire. Period. In Conclusion, I loved this book. Obviously, or else I wouldn't be writing a review at 5:30 AM!

I'm not knocking on Ms. Banks in particular because she writes very well. There's just absolutely nothing new or special here. And I think I've read this same plot line in at least half a dozen romances: A pretty little Scottish heiress, hiding out from an evil chief/laird/lord who wants to force her into marriage to claim her lands, ends up in the hands of a rival, gruff yet good, chief/laird/lord who also wants her lands but likes her, too, and convinces her marriage to him is her best option. The heiress is a virgin and shocked on her wedding night, and therefore the requisite scenes of asking older women for bedroom advice follow. While the heiress learns how to please her man and tries to become mistress of the keep, chief/laird/lord discovers how difficult it is to protect the heiress from any number of dangers she continually walks into, and from the constant threat of evil chief/laird/lord trying to take her away. Stop me if you've heard this one before.This is by no means a bad book. Ms. Banks' writing is neat and natural, the period detail is good, and the sex is hot. There's just really nothing original about it, and I found myself getting bored. We get a little action and excitement toward the end, but overall I wasn't captivated. I've seen lots of glowing reviews for this one, though, and I can't help but think that some of these reviewers haven't read as many highland romances as I have, and thus weren't getting such a feeling of same old, same old. It certainly wouldn't be a bad introduction for someone who wants to try a highland romance. Interestingly, though, I did find that both of our chief/laird/lord's brothers came across as being much more intriguing to read about, and there's a nice set-up in place for book two in this series. I'll probably give it a try in the hopes that it's more entertaining."}, {"userName": "Lucia", "userReviewDate": "Feb 02, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8837962-lucia", "userReview": "Arranged marriage is one of my favorite tropes in romance genre so obviously, I was looking forward to reading this book. However, romance-wise and plot-wise, this story is pretty simple, straightforward and full of clich\u00e9s (brooding confident overbearing hero and fierce independent heroine prone to cause difficulties). Moreover, I don\u2019t have patience with heroines who always blurt out everything they are thinking. It may happen once but repeatedly through out whole novel? That\u2019s one annoying trend and it made Mairin look quite stupid. In Bed with a Highlander is great pick for leisure reading and I have to admit that here were parts that I enjoyed.

In the past, I\u2019ve found that when I like books of one genre by an author I don\u2019t normally like books of other genres by the same author. So I put off reading this book. Even the description didn\u2019t sway me. It just didn\u2019t appeal. However, Alyssa kept bugging me to read this book. She promised I would like it. Every time I was looking for a book to read she would beg me to read this. And every time I would put her off and pick something else. I finally gave in and promised it would read it\u2026eventually. And I (reluctantly) made good on my promise. Even as I started the book, I wasn\u2019t looking forward to reading it. I am extremely happy to say that I loved every minute of this book. Mairin was very strong and protective of her family and she had the nerve to stand up to her husband. I loved the interactions between Ewan and Mairin. They were a great couple and the McCabe\u2019s are a great clan. I especially loved the scenes between Mairin and Crispin. I can\u2019t say I was disappointed (because I wasn\u2019t) but I do wish there had been a little more of a search for the traitor in their midst. All in all, I really enjoyed this book and I didn\u2019t want it to end.

Like no names or going back in thoughts, but comments like ''this is marvelous experience'' when he explains new position, well I don't want to know how good it was in the past for you dude. Adding to it him having dead wife and kid from her, needless to say it all felt meh to me.(wife is not mentioned or he isn't pinning away for her though. All his thoughts are for h. And no OW showing up or exes. In case someone would feel the need to point that out to me.)And first wedding night was awful, I think she should have made him grovel more.

With marriage Mairin holds a large dowry as well as a prominent piece of land, making her a target for those who would rather use her for the power they would gain then treat her as a proper wife.An abduction from the abbey where Mairin has been hiding thrusts her into protecting a young lad who is lost. Wanting to escape from her abductor who plans to force her to wed, sets Mairin on a journey that sends her to Laird Ewan McCabe whose son she has valiantly protected by her side, taking the brunt of the misuse they received. Ewan sees Mairin as a gift to his struggling clan, he sparks a deal with her, his protection for her hand in marriage, while she reluctantly agrees Ewan has no idea his wife is not only tempting but she is a spitfire who has her own ideas about things and doesn't seem to want to back down when it comes to going head to head with Ewan.Delicious. Mairin is a fireball and has a tendency to react often frustrating her husband Ewan who only wants her happiness, but also believes if she would just follow her orders things would be simpler.

Googling in the information provided in the novel I believe this story is set around the year 1134. The heroine, Mairin, is stolen from an abbey where she was hiding. Mairin escapes and ends up with hero, Ewan McCabe. While a bit spicy in places I did find it sweet. Some have compared this to Julie Garwood's historicals and I did find a similarity here and there. Mainly with the stubbornness of the heroine and the alphaness of the hero and the bits of witty conversation they had. Not being a history major I can't tell you how historically accurate it was but the conversations were in modern english. This could be a problem for some but not me since I don't speak old english or scottish.

She created an amazingly realistic backdrop and provides characters with depth. This one is no different. I felt like I was part of this world and got so sucked into the story that I read until almost two in the morning without even realizing it.Mairin Stuart is a young woman in hiding. She is the bastard child of the former King of Scotland. She is set to inherit a large plot of land upon marriage. The land is highly sought after. Her hand in marriage also comes with a significant dowry. Any clan to get her would be instantly wealthy. The problem is that Mairin may be wed and aught after to produce an heir. Once that heir is born, she is no longer useful. This is why she is in hiding. Waiting for the right moment to make her move.Ewan McCabe is the eldest son in the McCabe clan. He is the Laird of his clans keep. Ewan has a long history with Duncan Cameron. Cameron is poised to strike and he has his sights set on overthrowing the king. Ewan has his sights set on revenge. His problem is that his clan is poor. The walls of the castle are tumbling down and his clan barely has enough food to eat.When Mairin arrives at the McCabe keep she does so with a shroud of secrecy. She tries to keep her identity a secret. She wants to be able to go on her way and go back into hiding. Unfortunately for her, Duncan Cameron has set his sights on her and her inheritance.This story takes us on a twisted journey through time. It is set in a time where women are to do \"women's work\" and men are to do the heavy lifting and fighting. This book tackles this topic and I can't wait to see what happens in book two and three! I also love Mairin and Ewan together. Ewan immediately sees a marriage to Mairin as a way to protect her and a way to secure his own clan. Mairin was hoping to avoid marriage for a bit longer. She wasn't quite prepared to be bowled over by the burly Scot.Mairin is not an easy wife. She is opinionated and often talks back. She doesn't readily agree with her new husband and she finds herself knee deep in a conspiracy that could end very badly. There is a traitor in the keep and Mairin is in someone's cross-hairs. In the end, Mairin has to give up her notion of what is right and do what she must in order to survive.I absolutely love Maya Banks in this genre. I can't say enough good things about her. She is a master at creating sexual tension. This time period lends itself nicely to the dominating man in bed. I found many parts of this book to be quite funny ad lighthearted.I adored Mairin and Ewan together. They are both extremely stubborn and bull headed. Together, they are amazing. I am starting book two right now. I can't wait to see what Aleric McCabe gets himself into.5 Stars!\n\u00a0\u00a0www.readinghaven.me"}, {"userName": "M.
