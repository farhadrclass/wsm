This book was so much fun!!! Filled with action and mystery and some romance. I really enjoyed this book. The reason I give it a 4/5 is because of a few questionable things/words in the book.

This children's book (middle school age) is no different. The book opens with Mom (Sylvia), daughters Madeline (aka Mad) and Ruby (aka Roo) on an airplane that is about to land in the jungle in Costa Rica. They are accompanied by Ken/Neth, a consultant for the La Lava Resort and Spa. Mom and daughters have not heard in months from Dad (aka James or the Bird Man), an ornithologist the Resort, thru Ken/Neth, supposedly hired to document the local birds to help the Resort to prevent any other species going extinct like the Lava-Throated Volcano trogon. In fact, the last letter received was really creepy -- The Very Strange and Incredibly Creepy Letter -- and calls to the Resort only get messages supposedly from Dad. Upon arrival at the Resort, they find they have a 3PM appointment with Dad, but when they see him, Dad acts really strange and after 8 minutes they are told (by the beautiful Resort manager) that they must leave so Dad can get back to work. So begins the mystery of the daughters figuring out what's wrong with Dad and saving the day, as well as preventing a volcano eruption and learning (or not) Spanish. It me a while to get into middle school mode and just accept this book for what it was - a middle school adventure tale. And it is a good tale. The location provides a great location for an environmental lesson about endangered species in a tale full of magic. I loved that Roo's toes grew blossoms, more and more each day. The story is told from Mad's point of view. She's the older daughter -- 12 years old -- and doesn't ever grow blossoms from her toes. She thinks she's a coward but ends up (of course) doing something very brave. And, also of course, there is a 14-year old boy with beautiful golden eyes - Kyle - that Mad falls for. Kyle is bilingual and is hired to teach the Mad and Roo Spanish. His grandparents own the Lodge next to the Resort where Mom, Mad, and Roo stay, because kids aren't allowed at the Resort. Kyle becomes a major player in the adventure.Wouldn't it be cool to have your toes sprout blossoms?"}, {"userName": "Christina (A Reader of Fictions)", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2602702-christina-a-reader-of-fictions", "userReview": "Oh, middle grade books, you are just so delightful. One of my goals this year is to read more of them, because I've had such good experiences with all of my middle grade selections. Here Where the Sunbeams Are Green is the latest success. Phillips' debut is enchanting, full of adventure, nature, and a little bit of magic.For those who like to indulge wanderlust with fiction, Here Where the Sunbeams Are Green is a real treat. Set in the jungles of Central America, the descriptions are as lush and verdant as the landscape being described. Phillips captures both the beauty and the danger inherent in such a setting, from the poisonous bright-colored tree frogs to the daily monsoon-like rains. The descriptions bring this Central American jungle to life.Using this setting, Phillips conveys important messages about modern society's treatment of the environment and extinction of natural species. In Here Where the Sunbeams Are Green, the two young heroines and Kyle, a new (cute) friend, team up to save a species of bird, the Lava-Throated Volcano Trogon, from final extinction. A Lazarus species, the LTVTs were already thought extinct once, but now they are being hunted to death for sinister purposes, and, for some reason, their father, a bird expert and lover, is involved. Phillips manages to get her environmental messages across organically, without any preaching.My very favorite aspect of the story is the dose of magical realism that Helen Phillips added into the mix. La Lava, the plush resort Madeline and Ruby's father works for, is located next to an active volcano, one not believed to blow for another hundred years. However, this volcano's explosive tendencies correlate with the health of the LTVTs. If they die out, the volcano will explode. There are also these giant flowers that can be used as umbrellas if you push the right spot, and glowing mushrooms. These little magical touches really brought the story to life, adding a cinematic touch that middle graders will love.Mad makes a rather unique heroine. Middle grade MCs tend to be funny and plucky kids, adventurous and brave. Mad, on the other hand, fears pretty much everything and envies the confidence and talents of her younger sister. Mad's jealousy of Roo does wear a bit thin, but I was so happy when Mad finally realized her own strengths. Roo does seem a little bit too magical and clever, though, so Mad's inferiority complex does make a bit of sense. For example, Roo picks up Spanish in just a couple days.The plot follows pretty standard middle grade lines. Ruby and Mad's parents, while ordinarily loving and pleasant, have been made to act not like themselves. To restore their parents, Roo and Mad have to complete a quest, using ingenuity and determination. Along the way, Roo has a first crush. It's all very cute and empowering, if not anything out of the ordinary.Helen Phillips transports you to another place and takes you on a journey through the jungles. Her skill at description and timely message make Here Where the Sunbeams Are Green a wonderful choice for middle grade readers (and older ones too)."}, {"userName": "Carol Royce Owen", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1888096-carol-royce-owen", "userReview": "Note to self - Never start a book when you have taxes to finish. Today was a horrible day. I had to finish the taxes, but I was just a few chapters from the end of this book and I just did not want to put it down! I can't wait to share this book with students, because I loved it. I have an ARC version, so I looked to see when it was actually released because I would have loved to have seen this book as a contender for some of the awards. Helen Phillips creates a world that you wonder about - are there really flowers that grow so big in the rainforest that they can be used as umbrellas? Was there once a strange love affair between a mortal and a goddess living in a volcano, and is there a bird as beautiful and elusive as the LTVT? Do flowers grow between your toes in the rainforest?The characters each had their quirks, Mad's uneasiness and fears made her real. For once, here's a book where the older sister isn't the one \"leading the way.\" Instead, that falls to magical little sister Roo, who seems fearless and bold, and yes, a bit manipulative, as little sisters can be. Then there's Kyle, a 14 year old boy hired to teach the girls Spanish, but leads the girls along an adventure that leads them closer to finding out what is going on with their dad who seems to have gone insane.So, yes, I did finish the book - I used it as my \"break away from the taxes\" after about the 8th time that my Excel program shut down on me, losing information. Oh to traipse through the jungles instead of the jungle of receipts and W-2s that sat on my desk.

Both the heroines did bad things with no consequences. \n   The parents were gone (as usual). \n   The main characters were stereotypical. \n  It wasn't bad enough that the main characters cheated, lied, hid and broke promises, but to add on to that--no one ever corrected them. They didn't get punished either. Not only that, but I really didn't like the way that they went about things. At the beginning of this story, when I saw that Roo was being a bold brat and Mad was being a shy, nervous wreak, I was glad because\u00a0I thought that there was room for morals.\u00a0That Phillips could take the characters she had created and transform them before the faces of her readers to show them good themes and elements and how a person can grow. Unfortunately, Phillips didn't take advantage of the situation she had put her characters in and abandoned them to my rants.Eventually, Mad does find some small space where she begins to grow but for me, it just came too late in the book.And seriously? The parents are gone\u00a0once again?\u00a0One thing I admire about MG books where the parents aren't gone is that the authors have to be clever enough to work around or with the adults. Shoving the parents out of the picture is one mediocre, overused way to make sure your characters don't have to deal with anything like that.\u00a0Personally, I feel that a character that is able to work around the situations thrown at them--big or small--demonstrates what makes that character themselves.\u00a0Without that, I just felt like Roo and Mad lost any chance they had of impressing themselves upon me.Besides, the reason why the adults were gone was in no way mysterious or clever or even typical. It was really because of the choices they made and things that they did.Seriously? Roo's the brazen one and Mad's the meek one? Evil people get punished in the end? Despite being brainwashed, the family still strangely loves each other suddenly?*sigh* Cliches and wishful thinking at every corner does not cut it.On the bright side of things, I did enjoy the way that Phillips demonstrated the environment and how it's important as well as the love between the sisters. Formatting was done well and I had fun with the idea of some of the things used here, but overall--the book was a disappointment. The writing was for fairly young MG students, so even higher elementary level kids can enjoy it and I don't think they'll care about a lot of the things I noted. But for me, HERE WHERE THE SUNBEAMS ARE GREEN wasn't enough. 1.5 stars."}, {"userName": "Denzil Pugh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 06, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1631238-denzil-pugh", "userReview": "A cross of The Penderwicks and The Mysterious Benedict Society, but not quite as well done as either. The one thing Phillips does the best is creating full, vibrant characters with feelings as real as the kids who are reading the book. She describes the scenery of the rain forest very well, making you feel right at home at the small motel Mad, Roo, and their mom are staying in. But it's far from a perfect book....To me, the plot stutters and spurts, much like the volcano and its eruptions. It seems that the children go into the jungle to face certain danger while searching for their father, for the elusive bird, and they turn back without really ever having done anything. The aloofness of the mother was never really explained, and it was something I thought needed to be. There were parts at the beginning where it was clear that the author was trying to insert liberal ideology into a kids book. As if... of course the mother would keep her maiden name. And that the most important part about Vivi, the superstar actress, was that she gave readily to environmental issues. There were just hints of it at the beginning, before the story really started. And it really ticked me off. I almost told myself that if that keeps up, I was going to stop reading it. I have thoroughly enjoyed books with environmental issues, but only if it's not thrown in my face. Read Cary Neeper's \"The Webs of Varok\" and \"A Place Beyond Man,\" for books primarily concern with ecological balance but also with an amazing storyline. But I'm giving the book 4 stars because I honestly enjoyed reading it. The ending was satisfying, the explanation from the author was genuine and fitting at the end. It could easily be a part of a series, with the same characters growing up and finding their own iniquities and strengths. At the end, while Madeline was realizing some of her fears, it reminded me of John Christopher's Tripod books, where the kids have fears and faults, and aren't afraid to bring them out. It's what makes this book worth reading, and worth kids reading, for all it's faults... it's a good book."}, {"userName": "Daph (Loving Books)", "userReviewDate": "Mar 27, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328483-daph-loving-books", "userReview": "The synopsis intrigued me and I was very excited to be able to read it months before the release. Here Where The Sunbeams Are Green is a joyful, lively tale of adventure and discovery. Rich with imagination, it\u2019s sure to enthrall young readers and draw them into the place where the sunbeams are green.Sisters Mad and Roo get on a plane with their mom to go and visit their father, who is studying a species of nearly extinct birds in the middle of a rain forest. Mad and Roo have a feeling that something more is going on since their father is acting Very Strange, writing Very Strange and Incredibly Creepy Letters and not sounding like himself at all. When they arrive at the island, everything slowly unfolds. The two sisters take on the task of unraveling what is going on and try to bring their family back together. Along the way they make some unexpected friends, see some unexpected creatures and plants and feel a bit bedazzled by the beauty and power of the rain forest. They are quickly drawn into the middle of the plot their father is in and have to find a way out..This is one of those brilliantly built up tales that didn\u2019t really work for me. While the writing was lovely, the storyline very imaginative and the feeling around the story great, it just didn\u2019t connect with me the way I wanted it to. There were some moments that I absolutely adored, but there were also moments that I would want to skip over to get to the next part. I can\u2019t really put my finger on it what that is exactly, but for me, it wasn\u2019t the amazing tale I was hoping it to be.Having said that, the whole ambiance in this story is brilliant. I loved the magical feel of the story, the way the Lava Bird Volcano was worked into the story and how everything worked together to create the plot. It\u2019s a story of discovery, both for the girls themselves as for the discovery of what is going on and what is in this strange forest, and I\u2019m sure this story will appeal to both boys and girls.Find this review and others on Loving Books."}, {"userName": "Amanda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1753322-amanda", "userReview": "I wanted to REALLY like it, but the 2 sisters kept throwing me off from REALLY liking it--something about the cowardice of Mad and the bravery/anger of Roo drove me nuts! Was it that they were too one-dimensional? Was it the (lack of) story arc? Was it because I am an oldest sister and don't like it when the relationship between the oldest sister/youngest sister is portrayed in such a light? Blech! Maybe it was because the parents were absent?I know that parentals MUST be absent in books for adventures to take place (it's like storytelling rule #1), but the Mom in me freaks out(!) and hurts for these girls. Yikes. Calming down now. Anyway, maybe they will make a really horrible movie out of this and just destroy what could be a really cool book the rest of the way.... *sigh*Positive things: the sisters fully love each other no matter; nature/ecology/the environment is important; the family loves each other and does try to care for each other (after everyone is done being brain-washed); the setting was awesome!; Spanish was used throughout in a fun way; a celebrity steps up and helps out, showing that they are more than just a shallow individual; evil people get punished in the end; Mad finds her bravery when it counts.Negatives: the sisters disobey, lie, and break promises with no consequences!!!; the parents are largely absent (because of various adult choices) throughout the book and the girls suffer for this; swearing; drinking; Roo is a bit of a brat for most of the book and no one corrects her (you could argue extenuating circumstances, but there is also mention of her biting habit--where she draws blood!--and she is certainly old enough to know better by now).All in all a bit of a mix for me."}, {"userName": "Teresa Scherping Moulton", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5219268-teresa-scherping-moulton", "userReview": "Sisters Mad (Madeline) and Roo (Ruby) haven't heard from their dad - a famous ornithologist called the \"Bird Guy\" - in months. He's been in Central America, searching for an almost-extinct species of bird called the Lava-Throated Volcano trogon at the famous La Lava Resort and Spa. Mad is worried because their dad's last letter was strange, a part of a series of strange happenings that she calls The Weirdness. The mystery only deepens when the sisters arrive at La Lava and discover that everyone, from the workers at the spa to their own dad, seems to be hiding something. Their only hope is the teenage Spanish tutor and jungle guide, Kyle, and his family's story about a volcano goddess and the magnificent bird that was once her true love...I loved that this book had such a unique story, but it did drag somewhat in the middle of it and some aspects of the plot are never fully explained. Mad has a realistic twelve-year-old-girl voice as the narrator, although sometimes her anxiety and indecisiveness got a little annoying. In the end, I did like the way she was able to overcome her fears and grow as a character. The little sister Roo is also a very memorable (if slightly unrealistic) character, full of energy and curiosity. The setting was very well described so that sometimes I could almost feel the humidity of the jungle and smell its strange flowers.This book is most appropriate for 4th to 7th graders (there is a little bit of romance). I would compare it to The Penderwicks (for the dynamic between the sisters) or The Great Unexpected (for straddling the line between realistic fiction and fantasy)."}, {"userName": "Mundie Moms & Mundie Kids", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4397975-mundie-moms-mundie-kids", "userReview": "Middle grade readers will enjoy this exciting mystery, adventure book. Traveling to the heart of a Central American rain forest, sisters Mad and Roo, along with their mom and traveling companion, are on a mission to find out what's happened to Mad & Roo's father, who was offered a job to track and find rare birds. This lush jungle offers more than beauty, and the sisters find themselves face to face with villains, a mystery, and form an amazing bond during the process. I love it when authors can write a book for kids that's full of adventure, danger and excitement by incorporating bites of realism with that of magic and a lot of imagination. This is a book I think young readers will really enjoy as they get to know more about Mad and Roo, and feel like they're right along side them on their mission to solve the mystery behind their father's absence and what's really going on within the canopies of this rain forest. I adored the relationship the two sisters have and form during this trip. While Mad is the more serious, insightful one, Roo is a little bit less uptight and a bit more fun. She brought the humor to all the right parts of the book. Together these two are fabulous. It's hard not to love them for who they are. I thought this was a great read. I think it's one MG readers are going to enjoy. There are things they'll be able to relate to, other things they'll enjoy discovering, and over all it's a fun story to read about.

Its appealing for its tropical rain forest setting and extinction subject matter. The characters were loveable, a joy to read about. I really began to sympathize with the girl's situation immediately. At times the story moved quickly, I rushed through the pages dying to know what was going on, the element of mystery was ever present and alluring. Other times the story did drag a little, focusing a wee bit too much on rain forest details or subplot lines. This is one of those stories which could have probably been told in less pages. The puppy love in the story between the MC and her crush ended up being extrememly cute. My favorite character, Ruby, (Roo) never gave up, feared almost nothing and kept everyone laughing.
