I think it was her poetic evocation of place that thrilled me the most. It helped me get out of my narcissistic glass jar and connect more with my surroundings. I took more notice of the world and its detail. Bowen added a new depth and delight to my visual response of the external world. Many of her novels use the regency houses around Regent\u2019s Park for a setting and the park acquired an almost magical dimension for me every time I went there. It still does now. It\u2019s as if throughout this novel Bowen\u2019s sensibility is heightened to the pitch of a lonely woman in a big house who hears what sounds like an intruder downstairs in the middle of the night. Inanimate objects become animated and not only contribute to the tension of every passing moment but define it. The way light falls or dwindles becomes a coded text of prophecy. AS Byatt says in the introduction that she had initially dismissed this novel as too much a work of fine-drawn sensibility. But the novel hinges on a moment of barely plausible melodrama so the fine drawn sensibility is absolutely necessary to sustain not only its tension but its credibility. Both houses in this novel are ruled by vampiric matriarchs, one, you might say, dressed in pink, the other in black. Interestingly you won\u2019t find much feminism in EB\u2019s novels. Women often maintain a tyrannical reign of emotional censorship in her novels. Husbands are reduced to the equivalent of head butlers, emasculated, never speaking out of turn. Karen, the heroine, has such a man lined up as her future husband. Her mother runs a regimented house where deep feeling is considered an affront to good manners. In such houses it\u2019s a struggle for children to achieve identity. This is well dramatised in the first part of the novel where two children struggle to assert themselves in a house dominated by the overpowering Mme Fisher, aided and abetted by her subservient daughter, Naomi. Leopold is waiting for his mother to arrive. He has never knowingly seen his mother and knows little of her history. Part two tells us the story of how Leopold got to be born. Karen, engaged to be married, meets up with Naomi and her fianc\u00e9 in London. Max is a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Mme Fisher who Karen was in love with when she stayed with the Fishers as a young girl. She and Max begin an affair which has to be kept secret from her family. Only now does she realise how oppressive is the emotional regime of her home imposed by her mother. Bowen\u2019s depiction of young love in this novel is brilliant because her lovers are intelligent and can see through to the other side of all the exalting adrenalin. They are not fooled by the joyful anarchy of their bodies. They know they are committing an aberration which will bring two houses down. Each of the three parts of this novel gets better. The first part when the two children arrive at the spooky house in Paris is perhaps a little over-laboured. The second part, a flashback in time, is a fantastic dramatization of an illicit affair, and the third part when everything comes to a head is the best of all. Bowen doesn\u2019t write naturalistic dialogue, often used as a criticism against her by readers perhaps used to reading a more commercial form of fiction. Her characters, even the children, are all as eloquent as Bowen herself and their speech patterns blend seamlessly into her mannered prose style. The marvel though is that her children are completely convincing as children. 4+ stars."}, {"userName": "Marita", "userReviewDate": "Jul 02, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17415449-marita", "userReview": "A day fraught with drama and discovery in the Fisher residence in Paris\u2026 This is the day in which eleven year old Henrietta is in transit to her grandmother\u2019s house in the South of France, but having to spend a day in Paris with Madame and Miss Fisher until her next chaperone can join her to continue the journey.This is the day when young Leopold has come to Paris with high hopes.It will be a day of bitter disappointments, when a person young or old may be changed in a moment just as Karen\u2019s life changed in a moment in the past. Who Karen is, and what happened in the past is revealed in the middle section of the novel.#####Some of the characters:Mme Fisher: this sick old lady ls confined to her bed upstairs, but there is much more to her than meets the eye. I thoroughly enjoyed her conversation with Leopold.Miss Naomi Fisher: \u201cI am not femme du monde.\u201d She fiddles and fusses and tries to please. In the process she drives Henrietta nuts by constantly telling her to go and play. Henrietta indignantly but politely replies: \u201c\u2018We don\u2019t really play very much.\u2019\u201d Henrietta: Being told not to ask questions, she responds: \u201c\u2018I never ask people things,\u2019 said Henrietta coldly.\u2019\u201d and promptly asks questions. She doesn\u2019t fuss over Leopold, but treats him somewhat indifferently which endears her to him to some degree. \u201cNow he had said so much his excitement eased a little: he felt a cloudy liking for Henrietta and began to be glad she was in the room. Her matter-of-fact manner made him feel less extraordinary.\u201dLeopold: Leopold is fussed over and nurtured. \u201cHe was over understood.\u201d \u201cWhere he came from, kindness thickened the air and sentiment fattened on the mystery of his birth.\u201d He is utterly fed up!The section titled The Past tells the story of a different set of adults, but best not to say anything more here. The characterisation throughout is excellent, and even inanimate objects come alive: \u201cThe door shut behind them with a triumphant click.\u201d Elizabeth Bowen deftly and eloquently deals with the disappointments and devastation in her characters\u2019 lives.#####A few more quotes:\u201cBut she could not hear the clock without seeing the pendulum, with that bright hypnotic disc at its tip, which set the beat of her thoughts till they were not thoughts.\u201d\u201cThere is no end to the violations committed by children on children, quietly talking alone.\u201d\u201cThat autumn they sent her away to a finishing school, from which she came back next year with an unchippable glaze.\u201d\u201cYou suppose the spools of negatives that are memory (from moments when the whole being was, unknown, exposed), developed without being cut for a false reason: entire letters, dialogues which, once spoken, remain spoken for ever being unwound from the dark, word by word.\u201d\u201c\u2018I think that humour is English courage,\u2019 she said.\u201d\u201cHer words showered slowly on to Leopold, like cold slow drops detached by their own weight from a tree standing passive, exhausted after rain.\u201d\u201cThey both saw the crack across the crust of life.\u201d\u201cNever to lie is to have no lock to your door, you are never wholly alone.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Ryan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16529-ryan", "userReview": "I tried, man, I really tried to get through this fucking thing.

No gimmicks, bells or whistles. It has a minimalist post war cover and the most animated looking penguin logo ever. In hindsight perhaps the austerity was a nod to the emotional austerity shielded between the cover. Slightly less appealing is the back page with the author photograph. While I have no doubt that Elizabeth Bowen was probably a delightful woman, the photographer has managed to catch her in a pose which has left her looking like Aunt Sally from the Wurzel Gummidge TV series which was probably not the look she was going for (I like to think she was aiming for worldly and erudite but falling wide of the mark).I chose the House in Paris from the 1001 books list based on the name alone, as I knew nothing of the plot and being incredibly lazy did not bother to investigate prior to purchase. About Paris? hmmm, sounds lovely. It's not a lively book, nor is it particularly romantic or evocative of any kind of Parisian joie de vivre, and for the majority of the time I was reading I kept imagining all the characters with those impossibly clipped BBC accents that were so prevalent in the 40's and 50's amongst the upper middle classes ( if you don't know what I mean listen to the Queens speech). Needless to say this didn't help me to take them or their dilemmas more seriously. I disliked Leopold and Henrietta and found Charles the plush monkey (who was only a toy) to be a far more animated and likeable character. As for the adults (who were responsible for the accidental conception of Leopold); I found their story to be the most emotionally neutered love story I've ever encountered. Max and Karen plan their lovers tryst with stiff upper lips and military precision leaving the story with the residual romance of an abandoned fish supper on a wet weekend in Barry Island. I suppose the saving grace is Madame Fisher; a sinister corpse-like, bed-bound figure who despite never making it past 15 degrees from the prone position, still manages to meddle in everyones affairs. Bowen has created a memorable villain here... who knew an old biddy in a bed jacket could be so scary?"}, {"userName": "Roger Brunyate", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/42294189-roger-brunyate", "userReview": "Elegant and Melodramatic\u201cThis is both a very elegant and a very melodramatic novel.\u201d A. S. Byatt has it right, but her introduction, from which this comes, should absolutely not be read before the book itself. More a personal account of her own various experiences with the novel than an aid for the first-time reader, it manages to give away every important surprise. But elegant and melodramatic, yes. This was my return also, to a novel which I first read in 2005, and this time I skipped straight to the first chapter. To be softly seduced by Bowen\u2019s elegance, which I can\u2019t remember noticing before. Then drawn into the passionate but off-kilter romance of the middle section. Then knocked for a loop by what I was glad to see Byatt nail as melodrama, when I finally read her so-called introduction as a retrospective guide.Elegance first, starting with the novel\u2019s structure. It is in three sections, called respectively \u201cThe Present,\u201d \u201cThe Past,\u201d and \u201cThe Present.\u201d Henrietta Mountjoy, a young girl of eleven or so, is looked after by some friends of her grandmother\u2019s, the Fishers, while passing through Paris on the way to the Riviera. As things turn out, she does not leave the quiet house of the old lady and her daughter until it is time for her evening train. But she does meet there a boy of about her own age, L\u00e9opold, who has come to Paris to meet his birth mother for the first time. The middle section will reveal who L\u00e9opold is, and explain some of curious tensions that seem to revolve around his presence. The fact that these mysteries are observed by a sensitive but innocent girl with no possible understanding of adult sexuality provides a teasingly oblique perspective which is surely a large part of the elegance. Byatt compares Henrietta favorably to the title character in Henry James\u2019 \nWhat Maisie Knew\n; but then I love Maisie, and am not prepared to exalt one little girl over the other.Also elegant\u2014exquisitely so\u2014is Bowen\u2019s prose and social observation. This is a book that waits a long time before things begin to happen. But you do not mind, because there is such pleasure in reading Bowen\u2019s descriptions that it seems almost a shame to replace their infinite potential by mere action. Here are three examples, all from the second part, whose heroine is a young woman called Karen Michaelis. How beautifully Bowen captures the moneyed liberalism of her parents:\nHer parents saw little reason to renew their ideas, which had lately been ahead of their time and were still not out of date.\nEarly in the section Karen goes to visit an aunt in Ireland, only to come to the gradual realization that she is terminally ill. Here, Bowen\u2019s use of offstage music is a foreshadowing of what she would later do in \nTo the North\n:\nUp there in the drawing-room, Aunt Violet began playing Schubert; notes came stepping lightly onto the moment in which Karen realized she was going to die. Phrases of music formed and hung in the garden, where violently green young branches flamed in the spring dusk. A hurt earthly smell rose from the piteous roots of the daisies and those small wounds in the turf that her uncle, not speaking, kept pressing at with his toe. Down there below the terrace, the harbour locked in green headlands lay glassy under the cold sky. No one familiar in Karen\u2019s life had died yet: the scene round her looked at once momentous and ghostly, as in that light that sometimes comes before storms.\nAnd here is Bowen\u2019s penetrating analysis of first love, a little tongue-in-cheek but still penetrating:\nShe thought, young girls like the excess of any quality. Without knowing, they want to suffer, to suffer they must exaggerate; they like to have loud chords struck on them. Loving art better than life, they need men to be actors; only an actor moves them, with his telling smile, undomestic, out of touch with the everyday that they dread. They love to enjoy love as a system of doubts and shocks. They are right: not seeking husbands yet, they have no reason to see love socially. This natural fleshly protest against good taste is broken down soon enough; their natural love of the cad is outwitted by their mothers.\nThe long middle section of the book, which could almost stand on its own as a separate novella, shows Karen poised between the two kinds of love: the doubts and shocks of the first and the social propriety of the second. So long as Bowen maintains the suspense, her control is perfect. But now, well past the midpoint of the novel, she is split between two not entirely compatible directions. One is action; the other, perhaps as the result of action, is self-examination. In the techniques she uses for the latter, you are suddenly aware of her debt to Virginia Woolf, but I don\u2019t think she entirely succeeds in her own terms; there is an artifice that fits ill with the modulated naturalism of the rest of the book. And in this context, the more startling bits of action\u2014I am thinking especially of L\u00e9opold\u2019s father\u2014do indeed seem, in Byatt\u2019s word, melodramatic. I found myself thinking of her most obvious successor, Anita Brookner, who writes about many of the same subjects and settings with perhaps less flair, but even greater economy of action. Brookner at her best is elegance personified, perfect in her control of the emotional temperature. But then, by daring less than Bowen, she also misses the chance of being a novelist of the very first rank, which Elizabeth Bowen surely is.I said that the section called \u201cThe Past\u201d might almost stand on its own. So why not let it do so? The Paris house is not the locus of any of the real action, but it does frame the narrative. Karen\u2019s story means so much more to us after the many hints sensed, but never grasped, by Henrietta and L\u00e9opold in the first part. And the long central section ends without all its issues being fully resolved. The last 50 pages, headed once again \u201cThe Present,\u201d cannot tie up all the loose ends; the time gap between sections makes that impossible. But there is a welcome hint of a resolution with L\u00e9opold. Meanwhile Henrietta takes her train to the South unchanged\u2014except for the seeds of adult knowledge now planted inside her. So the book ends in ellipses; the elegance in that is to treasure."}, {"userName": "Lobstergirl", "userReviewDate": "Jan 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1910836-lobstergirl", "userReview": "\"In the first rank of the brilliant women writers,\" asserts the New York Times blurb, offensively. Actually Bowen is in the first rank of the brilliant writers. Her craftsmanship is exquisite, she is masterful at having her characters express the perfect emotion, and if there's a writer of adult novels who can write from a child's vantage point better, I don't know who it is.The House in Paris is divided into three sections. The first and last, titled \"The Present,\" take place over the course of one day. Eleven-year-old Henrietta is stopping over in the Paris home of Miss and Mme. Fisher, family friends, on her way to live with her grandmother in the south of France. Coincidentally a nine-year-old boy named Leopold is at the Fisher house the same day in order to be introduced to his birth mother, whom he has never met. By the end of the first section we know quite a few intriguing spoilers relating these characters, and a terrible sadness descends. Yet the tension in the novel never abates, as the second section (\"The Past\") goes ten years back to introduce us to Leopold's mother Karen, his father, and reintroduce their mutual friend Miss Fisher. This section is told from Karen's point of view and is set in London, Ireland, and France. We then return to the present and the Fisher house, where yet more surprising plotting unfolds.Some of my favorite passages:The inside of the house \u2013 with its shallow door-panels, lozenge door-knobs, polished brass ball on the end of the banisters, stuffy red matt paper with stripes to artfully shadowed as to appear bars \u2013 was more than simply novel to Henrietta, it was antagonistic, as though it had been invented to put her out. She felt the house was acting, nothing seemed to be natural; objects did not wait to be seen but came crowding in on her, each with what amounted to its aggressive cry.Leopold lives unhappily in Italy with his adoptive family:Spezia offered Leopold almost nothing: his precocity devoured itself there, rejecting the steep sunny coast and nibbling blue edge of the sea that had drowned Shelley. His spirit became crustacean under douches of culture and mild philosophic chat from his Uncle Dee, who was cultured rather than erudite.An excerpt from a letter in which Leopold's adoptive parents explain the delicate way they are raising him:\u201cWe do not consider him ripe for direct sex-instruction yet, though my husband is working towards this through botany and mythology. When the revelation regarding himself must come, what better prototypes could he find than the Greek and other heroes, we feel. His religious sense seems to be still dormant. We are educating him on broad undenominational lines such as God is Love.\u201dLeopold's birth mother, ten years in the past, visits relatives in County Cork:Karen, her elbows folded on the deck-rail, wanted to share with someone her pleasure in being alone: this is the paradox of any happy solitude. She had never landed at Cork, so this hill and that hill beyond were as unexpected as pictures at which you say \u201cOh look!\u201d Nobody was beside her to share the moment, which would have been imperfect with anyone else there."}, {"userName": "Sue", "userReviewDate": "Sep 12, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3642045-sue", "userReview": "When I started this book, I wondered if I would make it to the end. Everything seemed disjointed. No one spoke or acted as real people spoke or acted (at least not as I've experienced them). The children weren't really children; the adults...not sure what they were.Then I came to the middle section labeled \"The Past\". This section opened the book up for me, making the characters real, illuminating the author's choices (for me) even for the strange dialogue and monologue choices. Everything else seemed to flow then. Evil people were still evil, weak were still weak, foolish still foolish, but now I could see sense in the arc of the novel. Reality didn't exist until after that middle section had been explained (in my \"Paris world view\"). Then there could be closure of sorts.So I will not give spoilers for the plot...the major points are there in the GR description.

In the 90s, I wrote my diss on Bowen and other neglected British women authors (Olivia Manning, Storm Jameson, Antonia White, Betty Miller [Jonathan's mother:], Rebecca West), but mainly Bowen; she was my portal into the work of these women writing in Woolf's shadow. Last week, I reviewed Victoria Glendinning's biography of Bowen and was reminded that for all her resemblance to James, Bowen was an Impressionist, which approach Glendinning attributes in some degree to the fact that Bowen was extremely nearsighted and hated to wear her glasses. Thus those long, blurry, inferential descriptions of landscapes and interiors, as well as the extremely detailed accounts of faces (Max's, for instance). As with James, the reader has to surrender to Bowen's primary sensibility of life with the lid on--what's going on inside, what heated it, what's radiating unseen, how powerful those invisible, usually unconscious motives. You have the easiest time if you just let her take you where she's going (right down to the bone); those moments when you suddenly find yourself trying to decode pronoun reference happen when you come up for air, try to frame what you're reading in some more familiar shape. You just get in your own way.That said, I must also confess that The House in Paris is the one of her novels I remembered having tried twice to get through and failing both times, chiefly because Henrietta and Leopold didn't seem like children but like miniature adults. But this time, she got me with \"It is never natural for children to smile at each other.\" Now I am loving what a workout she is. And planning to reread several others, the more obscure (Eva Trout, To the North) as well as my well-worn favorites, The Heat of the Day and The Little Girls.P. S. The end is brilliant.

At the time I read this, I had (shamefully) never heard of Bowen or The House in Paris. As in Hadley's novel, this book starts out and ends in \"The Present\". The focus of The Present is two children, Leopold and Henrietta, who are stopping at the house of Mme. Fisher in Paris for just a day as a connection point for further journeying. The bulk of this book is in the middle section \"The Past\", where we learn the backstory of one of these children and how they came to be connected to Mme. Fisher. The House in Paris takes place in Paris, Ireland and London and is full of secrets, pregnant with expectation, energized by anticipation, misunderstanding, mistrust and cultural prejudice. It took me a while to get into the rhythm of this book, at once feeling slow and frenetic. Bowen's primary story-telling device is dialogue, dialogue filled with hidden meaning delivered in staccato. This tempo gets even more frenetic when Bowen writes in monologue, telling a person's thoughts. That aspect I found brilliant - don't our thoughts flood into our mind at that pace, often leading to confusion, heightened anxiety and doubt? I wondered in the first section of The House in Paris if I would like it. But in the middle section, Bowen writes passages of such brilliant insight into friendship, loyalty, romantic relationships/situations that they often took my breath away.

It's an odd work and I'm not exactly sure what I think or how I feel about it. What I'm in no doubt about, though, is that I wish I'd read the novel and not listened to it. This has nothing to do with the writing and everything to do with the main narrator, Elizabeth Jasicki. Her voices for a number of the characters were over-fussy and mannered, her French and Italian accents mediocre, her pronunciation of some words in English eccentric and her pronunciation of most words in French just plain wrong. I'll make every effort to ensure that in future I avoid books Ms Jasicki narrates. Now that I've got that off my chest, back to the book. The action, such as it is, occurs on a single day when two children - Henrietta and Leopold - meet in a house in Paris. Henrietta is en route to the south of France, where she will join her grandmother. Leopold has come to Paris from his adoptive parents in Italy because his birth mother has indicated a desire to see him. The events of the day are separated by an imagined telling of the story of Leopold's parents and of how Leopold came to be born. What I like most about this work is Bowen's characterisation of Henrietta and Leopold. Neither of them are especially likeable, but I found their thought processes and their reactions believable. I also like the way Bowen handled her themes: identity, time, secrets and lies, the relationship between mothers and their children. Another plus is the prose, which is sharp and clear, even though the dialogue can be a bit clunky. Overall, though, this was a frustrating literary experience, made more so by the ordinary narration. How can a novel manage to be simple and intricate, interesting and dull, restrained and melodramatic - all at the same time? I'm usually excited when I discover a new author and look forward to reading more of their work. Not so much this time. It's possible that this novel will grow on me over the next few weeks, but it could also remain a work I admire more than I love. It contains both five star and one star moments.

Many of them, in fact, and they continue to reverberate through the house in Paris...the lives of each person in the house start out the day without any portentous signs that, by the end of the day, there will be no one left standing unchanged.My Review: Oh dear, oh dear, it's just no use. I can't like this book. It's sentimental, it's melodramatic, and I just didn't get off to a good start with it, since I detested Harriet the prim, smug little dumpling and abhorred wet, sniveling, spineless Miss Fisher.The subtext of Harriet's grandmother's Sapphic affair with the invalid Madame Fisher, and the Big Reveal of Leopold's true connection to the Fishers, were not enough to make me change my low opinion of the book. Perhaps if I'd read it in 1935 I'd've been more enrapt. Here in 2011, not so much. I don't think Bowen was all that as a prose stylist, frankly, but I don't think the novel is her form. Her short fiction is far more limpidly written, and lucidly plotted. But still and all, the book isn't the worst I've ever read. I just wish it had been either shorter or longer. The middle section set in the past is awkwardly placed in the narrative, and the present-day bits don't really need it to make sense, so it should either be snipped out like an appendix or expanded to be a full narrative of its own.Not recommended, but no travelers' advisories posted about it either.

After having enjoyed Henrietta's and Leopold's banter, it was a bit hard to get into this part but once it got going, I really enjoyed it - and the story of Leopold's parents was very, very interesting.After we've heard the story of Leopold's parents, we are back in Paris with Henrietta and Leopold - and a very interesting plot twist that I did not saw coming at all.This was a very good book - the people in it felt so real, especially the two children. They were so amazingly well-written that they jumped off the pages. And the story was so good and convincing that I'm sure I want to read it again - and I've put it on my favourites shelf. Only bad thing about it is that it's very short - and I'm a sucker for long books - but on the other hand, this book contained a big story in a few pages and it was so complete that there was no need for any extra pages. It is just perfect as it is - and I loved it.But at the same time as it is complete and perfect, you are left with a lot of questions. Why did Max do what he did - and why did Ray do what he did in the end? How could Karen and Naomi remain friends? What role did Naomi's mother play in it all? Did she in some way orchestrate everything? What is Naomi's relationship with Henrietta's grandmother?But these questions just makes the book more perfect - you don't have to get it all explained - you just get a brief view into these people's life - and it's a great, brief view."}, {"userName": "Renata", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/697616-renata", "userReview": "I find that often the thing about a classic is that I walk away with some strong impressions about parts of the book and then upon retreading the book ( usually years later) I am staggered by all the new layers I discover.  House in Paris was not an easy read for me even as a 2nd go. The formal language, the reluctance of characters to truly speak their mind or their reserve all slowed down the process. Yet I do admit to spending a quiet day out in the garden reading almost all of the book today .  Henrietta and Leopold are two children who meet at the house in Paris at transition point in their life. Henrietta is stopping over on her way to join her Grandmother in the south of France. Henrietta is a motherless child being forced into a grown up world and yet as her tattered stuffed monkey suggests still wanting and needing to stay a bit more in the world of the child. Leopold is a bit younger (9) having arrived from Italy to finally meet his mysterious birth mother. Much has happened in this house owned by the ailing Madame Fisher and her daughter Naomi Fisher. Part 1 sets the tone with hints of mystery, tragedy, betrayal and also the heavy concerns for the children's welfare. Part takes place in the past, narrated by Leopold's mother, the best friend of Naomi Fisher. If they had made a film of the book I feel that Bette Davis or Ann Bancroft would have been well cast as the poisonously manipulating Mme Fisher. Part 3 returns to the present with Henrietta and Leopold trying to find their way through the entanglements of the adult world and their own perceptions as they navigate toward adolescence.  The book put in mind of Henry James and Virginia Wolff and even graham Greene's The End of the Affair. Themes of class, risk vs comfort, predictable vs change, happiness with choices over time, and death ran throughout the book. The choke hold of obligations and the dangers to self by giving in to romantic world views. Karen, Leopolds mother, agonized so much on how to be true to herself and also true to her family's expectations for her. \u201cShe thought, young girls like the excess of any quality. Without knowing, they want to suffer, to suffer they must exaggerate; they like to have loud chords struck on them. Loving art better than life, they need men to be actors; only an actor moves them with his telling smile, undomestic, out of touch with the everyday that they dread. They love to enjoy love as a system of doubts and shocks. They are right: Not seeking husbands yet they have no need to see love socially.\u201d I am very glad to have read the novel again and this time it is not just Henrietta and Leopold I will remember."}, {"userName": "Nicole", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/25128624-nicole", "userReview": "I was surprised by how good this book was. Like some of the other commenters below, I was more taken with the present than with the past, though once I had finished I could see how it works. For me the strength of this book's prose was its pace. It was slow, but in a good way. Not heavy or ponderous or even methodical, just taking as much time as is necessary to describe things as they are. I think, too, that this is why the present sections feel so much more engaging than the past; these sections are the slowest, while the past is much more engaged with a typical flashback narrative where important events are related in order. (Not that this is bad in general, just that this wasn't how the book started out.)I also found myself looking back to that time a few years ago when I picked up What Maisie Knew in a used bookshop, and then found myself tremendously disappointed by it. This book delivers some of what I had expected to find there; the children and their experiences are taken very seriously, and their perspective filters what happens in the present. In the last section, having read the past, you know more than they do, and that gap also drives some of the interest, but the first section, when the reader is placed into the same perspective that the children are -- having to guess what is happening, sensing that things are strange without having the necessary information to prove it -- this section makes the first section the strongest for me. All in all, an unexpected treat. I'm bumping her up a star because clearly this book is under-rated and not well enough known."}, {"userName": "Shannon (Giraffe Days)", "userReviewDate": "May 02, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/395599-shannon-giraffe-days", "userReview": "For my first foray into Bowen, who was a popular writer in her time, I picked The House in Paris mostly because it's from the 30s and I was looking for books written then. I don't know what year it's set in, but it's definitely between-the-wars. Perhaps due to knowing that another war happens, I am always expecting there to be some kind of sign, some conversation that shows a presentiment of danger, some sign that there's rumbling in the air. There never is any indication that the people, were they real, were at all aware of any undercurrents, any trouble on the wind. It surprises me, but when I stop to think about it: why should I be surprised? Maybe there wasn't and great rumblings of war, maybe people really thought the Great War was the end of it, and anyway not even modern authors make reference to political upheavals, distant wars etc. in their books, so why should Bowen?Having knocked some sense into myself, I settle down and focus on the story. The House in Paris has a simple premise: ten year old Henrietta travels from England to Paris on her way to Mentone to spend the summer with her grandmother. She stops in Paris for the day at the home of the Fishers - Madame and Miss Naomi Fisher, who have the temporary care of a nine year old boy called Leopold. Leopold is expecting to meet his mother for the first time in his life. The novel is divided into three parts - the first is set in the \"present\", and tells the story of Henrietta and Leopold; the second takes us back in time to the story of Leopold's mother, Karen, her friend Naomi Fisher and the man Naomi was to marry, Max - Leopold's father. The third part takes us back to Henrietta and Leopold and finishes the day. A.S. Byatt, in her introduction, says it's a novel about sex, time and identity. She also says she first read it when she was as old as Henrietta and Leopold, and I have to say if I hadn't read Possession I would never have believed it. This is a masterful novel, but the language - artistic in its intensity - isn't easy to read. That she understood, at 9 or 10, a line like the one she quoted - \"The mystery about sex comes from confusion and terror: to a mind on which these have not yet settled there is nothing you cannot tell.\" - boggles my mind - I'm 30 and I don't quite get it! (It's the words \"there is nothing you cannot tell\" that confuse me. The rest I get after reading it a couple of times, but I had to break it down into its component parts and read it like grammar.) The novel has these lines sometimes that I get the gist of, but not the literal meaning. The words just aren't used in a way that my brain is accustomed to, and so it strains to find meaning that clarifies and crystalises it. It's like, the sentences turn into maths equations. In this case, grammar equations!Speaking of grammar, I have to quote my friend Lisa here from her review on Goodreads, because it not only makes me feel like I'm not alone in this, but she says exactly what I wanted to say, so well:I had a difficult time getting used to the author\u2019s writing style which was spare and unusual, but lovely too. I felt stupid while reading because the writing style made reading this book feel challenging for me, but I felt as though I shouldn\u2019t find it difficult. Because her language was so precise, I caught at least some of her grammatical errors, notably split infinitives. The fact that I noticed such things in a novel meant I was sometimes almost bored or at least not completely engrossed. Despite the beautiful prose, it took some effort on my part not to skim at certain points, but I never wanted to stop reading. On the one hand, there is some absolutely beautiful language here, lovely imagery, and tonnes of atmosphere. On the other hand, there were some oblique sentences and even conversations that clouded my brain and reminded me of how I felt in classes like Critical Theory and Sex and Subjectivity in uni, trying to read Judith bloody Butler and the like. There are some styles that are like reading another language. You know the individual words, but the combination of them don't compute, the relationships of words are all new. Yes, like maths. It frustrates me. It was rather like skimming, not being able to understand properly. And I have to say, it's hard to admit that I don't. Makes me feel dim. I'm one of those people who wants to understand every. single. word. You know what it reminded me of? Shirley Hazzard's \nThe Transit of Venus\n. There's so much to love, in books like these (books with this kind of language, language that's like an abstract painting). Lines like: \"Her words showered slowly on to Leopold, like cold slow drops detached by their own weight from a tree stranding passive, exhausted after rain.\" (p.232-3) But I found it hard to concentrate on this book, and really take it all in as it deserved. There's a lot of detail, a lot going on between the lines and beneath dialogue. There were times when I'd read a page of description, and not take in a single word. Not because it was hard to read. It just wasn't concrete. Most of the time, I followed it perfectly easily. And yet, even as I'm reading the most straight-forward of sentences, I found that my usual reading technique - the way I read - wasn't the way I was reading this book. I was gaining impressions, rather than a literal word-by-word knowledge. It's really hard to explain. I'm quite fascinated by these things, but disconcerted too. Yet, I know if I were to re-read this, I would have none of the difficulty and all of the joy. It's a comfort, but I don't expect to re-read it any time soon. Books are the voices of individual people, and while there are particular canonised styles, every author has their own voice, their own style of writing. But like with people in the flesh, there are going to be writers who just think in a different way from you, and their line of reasoning isn't easy to follow for you - maybe not always, but enough to perplex. It's not about being smart or stupid. It's about whether a voice clicks with you or not. Like looking at a painting in a gallery or museum: at the end of the day, it either clicks with you instantly or it doesn't. You can admire technique, you can even find it beautiful and you can see why others love it - but if it doesn't speak to you, if it doesn't make your soul sing, well, that's just the way it is. For now, at least.But enough of that. From the start, the book snagged my attention in a personal way. Henrietta's arrival in Paris and her entry into the Fishers' house was a familiar experience because I've been to Paris, and I've been inside people's homes there. Bowen doesn't use fancy descriptions, but the house itself came vividly to life, it breathed and hovered, faintly sinister, over all the drama.The Fishers' house looked small because of its narrowness. It was three stories high, and also, stepping back, Henrietta saw another couple of windows, mansard windows, peering down from above. Its cream front was a strip marbled with find dark cracks; it just held, below the mansards, five wide-awake windows with grey shutters fixed back; two, then two, then a window beside the door - around these pairs of windows the house made a thin frame. ... The hall was dark, it had a clean close smell. Miss Fisher switched on the light, showing a red flock wallpaper; indoors, her manner became more assured and commanding. (pp.9-10) The inside of this house - with its shallow door-panels, lozenge door-knobs, polished brass ball on the end of the bannisters, stuffy red matt paper with stripes so artfully shadowed as to appear bars - was more than simply novel to Henrietta, it was antagonistic, as thought is had been invented to put her out. She felt the house was acting, nothing seemed to be natural; objects did not wait to be seen but came crowding in on her, each with what amounted to its aggressive cry. Bumped all over the senses by these impressions, Henrietta thought: If this is being abroad ... (p.11)Isn't that great? It was a strong image that managed to stay with me throughout the novel, lurking in the background. It makes for an interesting contrast for Naomi, or is a plain, fluttery sort of woman. She isn't so much straight-out described as coloured in in light strokes here and there, becoming fleshed-out through other people's rarely complementary eyes. Even though the people who know her are rather dismissive of her, we get a clearer picture of her by standing apart. The same goes for the other characters in the book: because we're not personally involved in the drama, because we don't know these people personally, we understand better.It's also fascinating to realise how much the characters' perceptions and opinions start to influence you, how you form judgements about other characters based on what they say and think, and, later, how wrong you are. And you think, \"how did I come to think that, to judge so quickly based on very little?\" The characters have that power over us readers, and it's quite something to get swept up in it. It creates twists in the narrative - not real ones, but ones where you've let yourself be fooled into thinking one way, when the truth is something quite different. This is especially true of Leopold's mother, and Max.Even though half of it is set in Paris, we don't get to see any of it. There's nothing French about this novel - in fact, it's decidedly English. The middle part is all set in England the Ireland, and even a trip to the coast of France could just as easily have been the coast of England. I was disappointed by that.This is a quiet, carefully paced story, one of intimate drama and slowly revealed truth. It's a successful novel, really, and you feel taken care of while you read - you're in the hands of a clever, skilled writer who draws poetic scenes. There is still that other side to it though, of sometimes speaking over my head and leaving me behind, that either makes me lose interest or antagonises me. But, as I mentioned before - and I know from flipping through it just now that these convoluted sentences are already disappearing - that on a re-read I would probably be able to get more out of it. There's a lot going on here. I can imagine it being used in a class at uni."}, {"userName": "Lisa Vegan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 09, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/83445-lisa-vegan", "userReview": "There\u2019s a great introduction by A.S.

I liked that it told a story of betrayal from the POV of two children, Henrietta (11) and Leopold (9). It was helpful that I knew the book was \"experimental\" when I had difficulty following certain scenes; a lot is left unsaid. The reader must infer the action, basing those inferences on the thoughts of unreliable narrators. The story is simple enough. Henrietta, on her way to visit her grandmother, encounters Leopold, on his way, he thinks, to meet his birth mother. The children are in the temporary \"care\" of Naomi Fisher, whose \"sick\" mother lies abed above the salon where the children are. Mme Fisher took to her bed ten (!) years ago after a tragic event in her house. The narrative is divided into three parts: present, past, present. The middle part focuses on a time ten years ago, perhaps imagined by Leopold, when a very fanciful young Karen meets secretly with the fianc\u00e9 of her best friend, Naomi. Elizabeth Bowen's writing is exquisite. Her descriptions of objects, trees, furnishings are poetic and almost make them surreal. She plays with time, slowing it down or speeding it up, sometimes eliminating significant chunks of it. I had seen the term \"impressionistic\" applied to Bowen's style, and this word came to mind in a helpful way when I finished the book. Yes, there were unanswered questions of the soap opera variety, but if I stepped back, as if regarding a painting, I saw the author's art in capturing the charming innocence of precocious childhood against a disturbing background of adult perfidy."}, {"userName": "Marigold", "userReviewDate": "Feb 23, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66498-marigold", "userReview": "I'm just not sure how I feel about this book!
