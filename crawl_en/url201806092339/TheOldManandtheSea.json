Cut your line, land your boat and go to McDonald's! Just as in the case of The Great Gatsby, I understand the book. Yes, I know it changed the way American writers write. I also understand that it celebrates the ridiculous American idea that you're only a REAL man if you've done something entirely purposeless, but really dangerous, in pursuit of making yourself look like the bull with the biggest sexual equipment. Get over it, already! Go home and clean out the refrigerator, or wash the curtains, or vacuum under the furniture. Pick your kids up from school or take your daughter bra shopping. THAT would impress me. Being too dumb to cut your fishing line? Not the mate I would pick...The only bright spot about the book is if you think of it on a metaphorical level: there is a point at which ALL of us must grit our teeth and hold on in the face of despair. That is the definition of life. However, if that's the point, then the plot situation needs to be one of necessity (like the shipwreck in Life of Pi), instead of stubbornness.************It's been a while since I wrote this review, and there's a lot of amusing speculation in the comments people have attached. I have to say, they crack me up. Here's my final word on reviewing on Goodreads (or anywhere); One of the most important elements of reading is that it allows each of us to react in the way we need to react, without judgment, as we experience the book. This is how I reacted to The Old Man and the Sea. Hemingway is dead, or I wouldn't have been so up-front with my opinion. He's not insulted, I understand that we all need goals in life, and I've been happily married for a LONG time. Now take a deep breath and smile. Life is too short to be anxious about picayune stuff like this."}, {"userName": "Stephen", "userReviewDate": "Aug 04, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1413439-stephen", "userReview": "My very first time reading Papa and I absolutely LOVED IT. Sometimes the experience you have with a book can be effected by many things beyond the narrative itself, and I think that is certainly the case here. While I believe I would have loved this story regardless, there is no doubt that the stars aligned themselves perfectly to make this a singularly special read for me.Let me explain...Last year, I was in Napa with my wife and two of our best friends celebrating my (oh shit!!) 40th birthday. It was the latter part of October (near the end of harvest time) and the weather was perfect...DUH, it\u2019s Napa. We were staying at our favorite Napa sanctuary, the Villagio Inn and Spa.\nThough pricey, Vellagio is just about perfect, it's centrally located, with wonderful rooms, and one of the BEST breakfast spreads in the world...Hey, when you are going out drinking all day, it is important to load up on foodstuffs to avoid alcohol-related trouble. have a nice big breakfast before you go out and drink all day...it is called being practical. Speaking of drinking all day, we had just come back from an awesome tour of the Castle di Amarossa Winery which is, I shit you not, a real castle in the middle of Napa, California...\n\u2026complete with MEGA DINING HALL\n...and a TORTURE CHAMBER\u2026..yep, a rack, an Iron Maiden and some device that made me constipated just looking at it. \n...Anyway, we got back to the room and had a few hours to relax before a late dinner reservation. Well, I don\u2019t sleep all that much and so, while my wife took a nap (light weight that she is), I decided I would find something fairly short to read. I choose this story because it was only 100 pages long (or just under 3 hours via audio) and it seemed to fit my time allotment perfectly. So, feeling a little buzzed and in a superb, yet contemplative mood (I had just turned 40 for crying out loud), I poured myself another glass of wine (shut up and don't judge me), went and sat on the balcony outside our room and, with the sun starting to go down, began listening to the audio version of this story. Well, this story slammed me and had me sucked in and captive from the very first words: \u201cHe was the old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone eighty-four days now without taking a fish.\u201d By the way, now would be a good time to mention that the audio version I listened to was read by Donald Sutherland, and the marriage of the story with Sutherland\u2019s perfect narration was nothing short of magical. In my opinion it is THE ONLY VERSION of the audio book that should be sold. \u2028\u2028As many have said (and almost as many have complained), this is in many ways a simple story about an old Cuban fisherman named Santiago, who has had a significant run of bad luck fishing (i.e., 84 days). \"Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the \u2028same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated.\" Attempting to change his luck, he decides to take his skiff further out than he has ever gone before, \"beyond all the people of the world.\" Eventually, he lands the largest Marlin he's ever seen and the bulk of the narrative details his epic struggle to reel in the fish and get it back to shore. \u2028\u2028Yes, a simple story and Hemingway uses sparse, straight-forward prose...and devastates with them. The most powerful emotions, passions and struggles that people experience are often tied to the most basic needs and the most elemental aspects of who they are. I felt an immediate connection to the story and was deeply moved by the restrained, yet palpable power of the narrative. The most lasting message that I took away from the story was that, despite the many hardships Santiago faces, and the titanic trials that he endures on the open sea, I NEVER ONCE felt that I was supposed to pity or feel sorry for him in any way. Here was a person doing what he loves to do, what gives him purpose in life, and struggling with an iron will to accomplish his goal. The struggle is hard, it is difficult, but it is who he is and what gives him fulfillment in life. All I could feel was giant admiration for this man. I found this uplifting and a powerful reaffirmation of what is truly important in life. \"But a man is not made for defeat. A man can be destroyed \u2028but not defeated.\"Whether it was the setting I was in, the mood I was in, the wine I was drinking, the wonderful narration or the power of the words themselves, in the end the result was the same. I felt ALIVE, and for that I say thank you \u201cPapa\u201d wherever you are!!! \u2028That is basically it, but I wanted to leave you with my favorite line from the story, one that I think encapsulates everything Hemingway set out to accomplish in his tale. \"And what beat you, he thought. 'Nothing,' he said aloud. \u2028'I went out too far.'\" \u20285.0 stars and one of my \u201cAll Time\" favorites. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!"}, {"userName": "Matt", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1232712-matt", "userReview": "I read this as a young man and was disappointed. It didn't work for me. I thought it was about a crazy old man gone off the reservation, picking a fight with an innocent fish while ranting about the New York Yankees (\"I would like to take the great DiMaggio fishing. They say his father was a fisherman...\").I picked it up again, after the passage of some years, and found it incredibly poignant. It's a simple story. There's an old man, Santiago, who is a fisherman fallen on hard times. He is cared for by a young boy, Manolin, who no longer works on his boat. Santiago goes into the Gulf and engages in the fight of his life with a giant marlin. What follows is a dream-like, stream-of-conscious meditation as the old man matches strength and wits with the great fish. After 84 days of no fish, Santiago takes his skiff far out to sea. He drops his line and hooks a marlin. He can't pull it in, so he takes hold of the line, beginning the back and forth: when the marlin runs, he gives the line slack; when the marlin is still, he pulls the line in. The old man's hands are cut by the rope. His muscles strain. He has no food or water. Yet he doesn't give up. The obsession has shades of Moby Dick, except at the end of this novel, I didn't feel the need to dig up Melville and punch him in the skull:I have never seen or heard of such a fish. But I must kill him. I am glad we do not have to try to kill the stars. Imagine if each day a man must try to kill the moon, he thought. The moon runs away. . . . Then he was sorry for the great fish that had nothing to eat and his determination to kill him never relaxed in his sorrow for him. . . . There is no one worthy of eating him from the manner of his behavior and his great dignity. I do not understand these things, he thought. But it is good that we do not have to try to kill the sun or the moon or the stars. It is enough to live on the sea and kill our true brothers.Eventually, the marlin is hauled in and killed. The old man attaches him to the boat, and begins to row towards shore. Of course, the marlin is dripping blood, so if you've seen Jaws or read James and the Giant Peach, you can imagine that his dreams of hitting it big with this fish are probably not going to come to pass. Age teaches you a lot of things. You start to realize that you might never be the person you thought you'd be as a child. Days go by, you start to lose more and gain less. I thought about this as I thought about the old man, raging like Dylan Thomas against the night; an old man nearing the end of his days fighting against nature, time, death, a fish, able to boil all things down into one climatic struggle on the high seas. At the end, he did not succeed, at least not in the manner he'd foreseen, but he was, in an inimitable way, victorious. 'You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food,' he thought. 'You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?'"}, {"userName": "Madeline", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111921-madeline", "userReview": "\"There isn't any symbolism.

It was the last major work of fiction by Hemingway that was published during his lifetime. One of his most famous works, it tells the story of Santiago, an aging Cuban fisherman who struggles with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream off the coast of Cuba. In 1953, The Old Man and the Sea was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and it was cited by the Nobel Committee as contributing to their awarding of the Nobel Prize in Literature to Hemingway in

Our senses were acutely sharpened. We were aware of each minute spent in this capital of human storytelling, of the neverending drama of human culture and nature in interaction and in occasional clashes. Looking out over the river, my son and I spot the sorry remains of a boat, just the bare metal frame without any \"flesh\", and we instinctively say at the same time:\"Hemingway's old man!\"We look at each other, smile at our simultaneous association, and start arguing whether or not one can see the fish in the same way as a boat, or whether the destruction of the boat is a more definitive loss. While we are arguing, my younger children are enquiring about the story we discuss, and we give them the details.\"Losing something means you really had it!\"That is their conclusion, and while my eldest son and I start pondering whether or not the younger two are ready for the old man and the sea in Hemingway's own words, we continue walking, and life goes on, and a new generation of Hemingway readers find sense and meaning in his parable on the human struggle.We feel like saying: \"I'm sorry, boat!\", in the same way the old man said: \"I'm sorry, fish!\"But the fact that it lies there showing its naked metal ribs tells us it truly existed. That's more than nothing. And it is not a bad place for a boat to rest. Just like the old man and the fish are in good hands between the covers of a Hemingway novel.Nothing's lost as long as we can tell stories about it.Brilliant parable of man's struggle with nature and himself.

Santiago - a humble fisherman with no legendary crew to command and only his frail body instead of a Pequod to do his bidding.Ishmael is a young boy, who instead of being a \"end is nigh\" Nostradamus is a loving, weeping young boy who cares deeply about the world.Queequeg is probably the dolphin which was the old man's only hope against his foe, his brother.Now Moby Dick for me was the grand struggle of an obsessed genius with his destiny (in fact, about the creative struggle) - it proves that life is a tragedy and in the grand conclusion, you go down with a mighty confrontation and your ambitions take you down to the depths of the sea - no trace left of either you or your grand dreams except a mist of madness propagated as a half-heard story.This was profound and it moved me to tears - but it was still grand, was it not? The great struggle, the titanic battle and the heroic capitulation! It was operatic and it was uplifting - even amidst the tragedy, the mighty bellow of man's cry in the face of the unconquerable; that gave me goosebumps.But Hemingway and his Old Man has turned the story on its head. It takes you beyond the happily-ever-after of Moby Dick (!) and as always those unchartered waters are beyond description. This alternate universe is much more cruel and much more real. There is no grand confrontation that ends in an inspirational tragedy. It turns it into a battle of attrition - you are inevitably defeated even in success and life will wear you down and leave no trace of your ambitions. It makes you battle to the last breaking point of every nerve and sinew and lets you win a hollow victory that you cannot celebrate as life has worn you out too much in your pursuit of your goals and the destiny, the destiny too now seems more and more unreal and you ask yourself if you were even worthy enough to start the battle.And as you turn back after that jaded victory, then comes the sharks, inevitably, inexorably. And then begins the real battle, not the grand epic, but a doomed, unenthusiastic battle against reality - with the knowledge that no grand ambition can ever succeed. And the old man tells it for you - \"I never should have gone out that far!\"The alternate universe is depressing and it is Zen at the same time, I do not know how. I probably have to read this many more times before any hope, any secret light in it comes to illuminate me - for today, for this reading, Hemingway has depressed me beyond belief and I cannot remember how I always thought of this as an inspirational fable! The scene in which the restaurant lady sees the bones of the once great fish sums it up for me - In the end you give up hope of success and only wish that at the very least you might be able to bring back a ghost of the fish so that people can see how great your target really was - but all they see is the almost vanished skeleton of your idea; your grand dreams are just so much garbage now and who will have the imagination to see the grandeur it had at its conception?\u201cThey beat me, Manolin,\u201d he said. \u201cThey truly beat me.\u201d\u201cHe didn\u2019t beat you. Not the fish.\u201d\u201cNo. Truly.

Garnering from his life experiences, his novels reflect on his time as a newspaper reporter and correspondent in a Europe during both the inner war and war years. A member of the lost generation, Hemingway was the first of his group to have a major work published. In addition to all of the accolades bestowed upon him, Hemingway is considered along Steinbeck to be a master storyteller, especially of short stories. The crowning achievement to an illustrious career, The Old Man and the Sea won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1952, less than ten years before Hemingway's death. Santiago is an older fisherman in Havana. He is content fishing and contemplating on his life while finding out the daily baseball scores. His favorite ball player is Joe DiMaggio because his father was a famed fisherman. As a younger man, Santiago was considered the strongest man in Havana, one time outlasting a negro from Cienfuegos in a twenty four hour arm wrestling duel. Yet, despite his fame and accomplishments as a fisherman, Santiago's luck has run out on hm. As an older man, her needs help from a boy to complete his daily fishing hauls and tasks, and has not caught a fish in 84 days. In spite of this run of poor luck, Santiago still returns to the seas on a daily basis, hopeful to catch the big fish that has alluded him for his entire life. Because of lack of successes, his boy has turned to another, lucky fishing boat. Santiago has to go at it alone, with only two fishing lines and baits. Determined to catch that big one, he sets out even with the dangers of sea, especially sharks, knowing that each journey into the water could be his last. Yet, this is subsistence and sustenance for many people on an island, so Santiago persists at his task. His voyage for the big fish becomes more than a fishing trip but his contemplating life, bestowing his wisdom on both the fishing trade and life knowledge on the younger generations. This is without the assurance that he will even catch a fish or if this determination to catch the big one will be his last voyage. From this 120 page novella, one can see glimpses of Hemingway's greatness. His sentences are full of imagery and imparting the wisdom of a rich life. As an older man, he himself enjoyed fishing and Santiago mirrors how Hemingway spent his later life. I have read a number of Pulitzers, and while the writing of this novella is enriching, I am left wondering if perhaps Hemingway won the award here as a crowning jewel on his life body of work. The story was captivating and full of messages yet a novella, rather than a novel. Perhaps, unbeknownst to me, this powerful novella was the best work of fiction in its given year and worthy of the award. In my quest to read the Pulitzers, I am glad that I was finally lead to read Hemingway. It is clear to me that he is a master of his craft, and I look forward to reading his further work. The Old Man and the Sea looks back on an enriching life and won Hemingway a deserving award, if not for his lifetime of writing. As a lovely story and another Pulitzer I can check off my list, The Old Man and the Sea rates 4 powerful stars."}, {"userName": "Jibran", "userReviewDate": "Jan 04, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5407952-jibran", "userReview": "My big fish must be somewhere.Many years ago when I read The Old Man and the Sea I thought it was going nowhere, that it was too simple and ordinary to be of any consequence. On a second reading, however, my view changed and I ended up loving it. What I mistook for repetition was a literary device for emphasis and the boat, like the story, that I judged to be unmoving in the rolling seas was caught in a whirlpool churning the waters in its depth so that the boat and the old man at the sea were never at rest till the end.Although grounds for comparison do not exist, reading this novella, Orhan Pamuk came to mind. It's their ability to weave the many similar threads of narrative into a stunning improvisatory whole that turns a small, and prima facie simple, scenario that might be covered in a few pages into an expanded mass of words that transcends the boundaries of its immediate context to inform on larger human struggle. Repetition or artistic improvisation, when done well, is fascinating and here Orhan Pamuk and Ernest Hemingway appear brothers-in-arms. You start with a pin prick of a view that widens and opens out into a wide vista giving you a clear view of the clutter of human ethos. Like his so many stories it's a tale of a heroic struggle but only inasmuch as a frail-legged ant suffers to get a tiny lump of sugar to its colony to claim its superiority on the lesser types. A knackered old man dreaming on the seas of a big catch in a boat fit for the axe of a lumberjack with a young boy for a helper do not evoke the romantic world of heroic battles fought by the gun-wielding machismo of Hemingway's other stories. This is something simpler in its setting yet more profound in its humanistic import.A piece of writing - a prose story or a poem - becomes great because it has no single, fixed, literal meaning that forbids imagination. It is the reader who picks up the idea consistent with the subjective conditions of his own worldview, interpreting the text, changing it, and then getting changed by it in turn. This novella lends itself to interpretation on multiple levels and, for its rich imagery of natural elements and human emotions, remains one of the very best Hemingway offered us.October 2015"}, {"userName": "Fernando", "userReviewDate": "Feb 08, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7665532-fernando", "userReview": "Cuando yo era chico, a la edad de diez a\u00f1os, acostumbraba a acompa\u00f1ar a mi pap\u00e1 a pescar. A m\u00ed no me gustaba la pesca, pero me encantaba verlo a \u00e9l en todo el esplendor de su pasi\u00f3n. Mi padre era carpintero, pero los domingos acostumbraba a subir a su lancha \u201cGui-Fer II\u201d que hab\u00eda reconstruido (era un bote de salvamento de un viejo barco pesquero llamado \"Cristo Rey\") y pasaba toda la ma\u00f1ana y la tarde pescando en su querida laguna \u201cBrava\u201d.Una tarde, nos llev\u00f3 a un lugar m\u00e1s lejano llamado \u201cLa cueva del tigre\u201d, que se parece m\u00e1s a la locaci\u00f3n de una novela de Joseph Conrad que de un lugar para ir a pescar. Arm\u00f3 su equipo (era un profesional en esto) para pescar corvinas y comenz\u00f3, hasta que en un momento enganch\u00f3 algo realmente pesado. Intu\u00eda que era un pez enorme. Le llev\u00f3 un trabajo tit\u00e1nico y una lucha de cuarenta y cinco minutos sacarlo y todo esto haciendo pie en un lugar lleno de algas resbaladizas y con un equipo de pesca para peces de mucho menor peso y tama\u00f1o.Extenuado y con los brazos doloridos, finalmente lo sac\u00f3. Era un tibur\u00f3n leopardo de 2,10 metros de largo y 42 kilogramos. Una pieza realmente excelente que en su desesperaci\u00f3n cuando se encontr\u00f3 fuera del agua intent\u00f3 tirarle un mordisc\u00f3n a un pescador que con la mano quiso agarrarlo de la cabeza. Lo llevaron en un Jeep hasta un lugar en donde lo colgaron y mi padre se sac\u00f3 una foto (que lamentablemente ya no tengo) exhibiendo orgulloso su trofeo. Recuerdo que en la foto, la cola del tibur\u00f3n se doblaba por el piso. No pudieron extenderlo en su totalidad desde el malacate. Jam\u00e1s en mi vida vi a alguien pescar algo tan grande.\u201cEl viejo y el mar\u201d es una novela inolvidable para m\u00ed, porque me remite siempre a esa experiencia que viv\u00ed con mi padre. La lucha de Santiago con semejante pez es m\u00e1s agotadora y le lleva m\u00e1s tiempo pero la similitud entre ambas \u201cluchas\u201d es sorprendente.Esta novela le fue encargada a Hemingway por la revista Time y gracias a ella gan\u00f3 el premio Pulitzer en 1953 y adem\u00e1s le sirvi\u00f3 de espaldarazo para ganar el premio Novel un a\u00f1o despu\u00e9s.Es tambi\u00e9n un ejemplo de tenacidad, de superaci\u00f3n y fortaleza porque el viejo Santiago nunca se rinde. Pelea y pelea hasta el final y de esa lucha sin tregua primero contra el pez y luego contra los tiburones que de a poco van despedazando su presa pero no cede hasta arribar al puerto con los restos que le quedan del pez. De toda esta historia surge la frase m\u00e1s famosa del libro: \"Un hombre puede ser destruido, pero no derrotado.\"En el caso de la novela se aplica a la lucha de este pescador durante toda su traves\u00eda pero es algo que todos podemos aplicar en cualquier aspecto de nuestras vidas.Es un libro muy corto y se disfruta much\u00edsimo. Yo lo recomiendo mucho. Santiago es para m\u00ed, Oscar, mi pap\u00e1, a quien ya no tengo conmigo pero que llevo siempre presente en mi coraz\u00f3n."}, {"userName": "Ahmad  Ebaid", "userReviewDate": "Dec 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16783645-ahmad-ebaid", "userReview": "\"\u0644\u0645\u0627\u0630\u0627 \u064a\u0633\u062a\u064a\u0642\u0638 \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0642\u062f\u0645\u062a \u0628\u0647\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0646 \u0645\u0628\u0643\u0631\u0627 !! \u0623\u0644\u0643\u064a \u064a\u0641\u0648\u0632\u0648\u0627 \u0628\u064a\u0648\u0645 \u0623\u0637\u0648\u0644 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0622\u062e\u0631\u064a\u0646\"\u0648\u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0627\u0628\u0642\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629, \u062a\u0644\u062e\u0635 \u0634\u0639\u0648\u0631 \u0627\u0631\u0646\u0633\u062a \u0647\u0645\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0627\u064a \u0641\u064a \u0633\u0646\u064a\u0646 \u0643\u0647\u0648\u0644\u062a\u0647 .**\u0647\u0646\u0627\u0643 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0645\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u0644\u0627\u0645 \u064a\u062f\u0648\u0631 \u0639\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0648\u0627\u064a\u0629 \u0648\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u0632\u064a\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u062a\u064a \u0628\u0647\u0627, \u0648\u0627\u0644\u062d\u0642\u064a\u0642\u0629 \u0623\u0646\u0627 \u0644\u0645 \u0623\u062d\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0623\u064a \u0631\u0645\u0632\u064a\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0623\u0628\u062f\u0627, \u0647\u064a \u0642\u0635\u0629 \u062d\u0644\u0648\u0629 \u062c\u062f\u0627 \u0639\u0634\u062a \u0641\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0643\u0644 \u0644\u062d\u0638\u0629 \u0645\u0639 \"\u0633\u0627\u0646\u062a\u064a\u0627\u062c\u0648\" \u0648\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0639\u0647.**\u062f\u0643\u062a\u0648\u0631 \u062c\u0627\u0628\u0631\u064a\u0627\u0644 \u0648\u0647\u0628\u0629 \u0645\u0644\u062e\u0635\u0647\u0627 \u0645\u0639 \u062a\u062d\u0644\u064a\u0644 \u0646\u0642\u062f\u064a \u0631\u0627\u0626\u0639, \u0648\u0623\u0642\u062a\u0628\u0633 \u0645\u0646\u0647:\"\u0623\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u0632 \u0641\u064a \u0642\u0635\u0635 \u0647\u0645\u0646\u062c\u0648\u0627\u064a \u0641\u0644\u0627 \u064a\u062f\u062e\u0644 \u0648\u0639\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0642\u0627\u0631\u064a\u0621 \u0643\u0631\u0645\u0632 \u0623\u0628\u062f\u0627\"\u0648 \u0647\u0630\u0627 \u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u0627\u0644\u0633\u0628\u0628 \u0644\u0639\u062f\u0645 \u0625\u062d\u0633\u0627\u0633\u064a \u0628\u0627\u0644\u0631\u0645\u0632, \u0648 \u0644\u0645\u0627 \u0627\u062e\u0630 \u0646\u0648\u0628\u0644 \u0644\u0644\u0622\u062f\u0627\u0628 \u0639\u0646\u0647\u0627 \u0643\u0646\u0645\u0648\u0630\u062c \u0644\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u062f\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0646\u0627\u0636\u062c \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0635\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u062f\u064a\u062b, **\"\u0644\u0643\u0646\u064a \u0623\u0624\u062b\u0631 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u0639\u0645\u0644\u062a \u0639\u0645\u0644\u0627 \u0623\u0646 \u0623\u062a\u0642\u0646\u0647, \u062d\u064a\u0646\u0626\u0630 \u0625\u0630\u0627 \u062c\u0627\u0621 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0638 \u064a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0621 \u0645\u062a\u0647\u064a\u0623 \u0644\u0627\u0633\u062a\u0642\u0628\u0627\u0644\u0647\" \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062c\u0645\u0644\u0629 \u0623\u062d\u0633\u0633\u062a \u0628\u0639\u062f\u0647\u0627 \u0628\u0646\u0634\u0648\u0629 \u0643\u0628\u064a\u0631\u0629, \u0644\u0623\u0646\u064a \u062a\u0642\u0631\u064a\u0628\u0627 \u0648\u0635\u0644\u062a \u0644\u0646\u0641\u0633 \u0647\u0630\u0647 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0629, \u0645\u0646 \u062a\u0623\u0645\u0644\u064a \u0644\u0644\u062d\u064a\u0627\u0629 \u0645\u0646 \u062d\u0648\u0644\u064a. \u0648\u0647\u0630\u0627 \u0647\u0648 \u0646\u0635 \u0627\u0644\u062d\u0643\u0645\u0629 \u0628\u0635\u064a\u0627\u063a\u062a\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0644\u0649 \u0644\u0647\u0627: \"\u0627\u0644\u0628\u0633, \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0633 \u0648\u0627\u062c\u0647\u0632 \u062f\u0627\u064a\u0645\u0627 \u0639\u0634\u0627\u0646 \u0644\u0645\u0627 \u062a\u064a\u062c\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u0631\u0635\u0629 \u062a\u0643\u0648\u0646 \u062c\u0627\u0647\u0632 \u0644\u064a\u0647\u0627 \u0648\u0645\u062a\u0636\u064a\u0639\u0634 \u0645\u0646\u0643\""}, {"userName": "Lyn", "userReviewDate": "Jul 30, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5253785-lyn", "userReview": "A masterpiece.

Happy 2016, Goodreaders!  \"No one should be alone in their old age. But it is unavoidable.\" And so the old man went to the ocean alone on his skiff to catch some fish but ended up being caught by the big fish instead, a fish so big, it controlled the skiff and took its own course at the sea. The big question is why didn't the old man just let go of the fish? It would have made his life easier. He was wise wasn't he? But again, who says wisdom always coincides with practicality? I noticed when reading classics, I end up posing more questions than answers. I guess that's what most classic novels intend to do-to make you question life. To make you think and ponder deeply about the events in the story which may appear superficial and boring at the surface but dense and philosopical in their deeper meanings.When you're old and wise and you catch the biggest fish (literal or metaphorical) in your life, you wouldn't let it go that easily. You'll fight for it no matter what the cost, the best way you know how even if it meant you may have to risk your life or swallow your pride.What fate awaits the old man trapped in the middle of the sea, caught in both internal and external conflicts? You'll be surprised to find out when you read the novel. You'll be even more surprised at the amount of things you'll realize at the end of the story. ^^For an excellent review that catches the novel's very essence, do read Vani's review."}, {"userName":

of Darwinist Capitalism and the survival of the most aggressive and hungry in the world of corporate enterprise and rivalry.Hey, What's the Big Idea?It describes what it feels like to have one big idea or to invent something for which the market is not ready.You struggle and wrestle with your \"big fish\" for ages, until in your mind you have caught it and perfected the way to reel it in, nobody is watching when you start the journey back to the market, your rivals snipe and question you and your catch, the market stands back apprehensive and sceptical, you never give up even when you're totally broken backed and exhausted, then the sharks start to have a field day pecking at your catch, first tentatively, then more confidently when they realise you're too poor to fight them off, then one day you discover there is nothing left of your catch, your rivals have offered the market an alternative but inferior product, and your wife and children regard you as a failure.The Old Man and His ChairEvery afternoon, before dinner, you sit shattered and weary in your chair, wondering whether it would have been so much easier to get a job, be a salary boy and do what the man said.Just before you fall asleep, you wonder if there is such a thing as karma or reincarnation, it would be nice to get a second chance to prove your worth and avoid making the same mistake of believing in yourself, your ideas and your resilience.One afternoon, you don't wake up from your sleep.An Old Man, A Big Fish and the SeaOne old man was lucky enough to have another old man with a beard write a book with simple sentences about his life.That book will have to suffice for the rest of us and our efforts.We read it when we are too young and don't realise that it might one day describe what has happened to those of us who are brash enough to have big ideas.It's just a book about an old man, a big fish and the sea.For Brian\"When a true genius appears in the world, you may

So because of [concern over] the fruits of your karma, never shirk from it.\"This is most probably the most quoted, used, misused, praised and maligned verse from the Bhagavad Gita, where Lord Krishna instructs Arjuna on the Karma-yoga. It has been praised as the epitome of virtue to do your duty regardless of the consequences: it has been severely criticised as the upper caste Hindu spiritual drug to force a person to follow his caste duties without contemplation. Both views have their merits: but what they ignore is that, spirituality aside, this is what keeps most of us sane - having very little control over where we are placed as a cog in this huge machine of the universe, the best thing is to bite the bullet and press ahead, and do the best you can.Hemingway's old fisherman, Santiago, would not have known the Gita. But he echoes its philosophy when he says:Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought. But that was the thing that I was born for.Being born as a fisherman, his karma is to fish - it does not matter whether he manages to land anything. Everyday he keeps on returning to the sea, becauseMy big fish must be somewhere.Yes, indeed.-------------------------This slim book is Hemingway's testament to the eternal struggle of man against nature, a dance of life and death, enacted by Santiago and the marlin against the backdrop of the sea and the sky. Even while intent on killing one another, the contest is one of love as well as antagonism.\u201cFish,\" he said, \"I love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.\u201d You did not kill the fish only to keep alive and to sell for food, he thought. You killed him for pride and because you are a fisherman. You loved him when he was alive and you loved him after. If you love him, it is not a sin to kill him. Or is it more?There is nothing personal in it, no pleasure or pain - just the inevitability of karma. And it does not matter whether one wins or loses, whether one has the catch to show for one's victory - for the act of fishing is what is important, for a man who was born to be a fisherman.Up the road, in his shack, the old man was sleeping again. He was still sleeping on his face and the boy was sitting by him watching him. The old man was dreaming about the lions.Something attempted, something done, has earned a night's repose. Tomorrow is always another day.One of the real gems of world literature."}, {"userName": "Councillor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/40792319-councillor", "userReview": "On the first glance, The Old Man and the Sea is a very simple story about a Cuban fisherman fighting against a giant marlin. On the second glance ... it is still a very simple story. You won't find any complex characters in this story, you won't find even the smallest trace of complexity. One can try to find symbolisms in this story (and will most likely succeed), but as Ernest Hemingway said himself: \"There isn't any symbolism. The sea is the sea. The old man is an old man. The boy is a boy and the fish is a fish. The sharks are all sharks no better and no worse. All the symbolism that people say is shit. What goes beyond is what you see beyond when you know.\"What remains when you take away the lack of complexity? A powerful tale about the efforts of a human being to achieve a certain goal and about how easy it is to lose what you have won. And powerful it is indeed. I was familiar with Hemingway's writing style and his tragic life due to preparing a school presentation about him years ago and reading some of his short stories, so I was able to direct my expectations to the necessary direction, ultimately finding - as surprising as this may sound - a lot to enjoy in here.I don't know if any other author would have been able to spend 140 pages on a subject as simple as this (although Dickens probably could), but Ernest Hemingway succeeded in the attempt, creating a timeless classic. The language is not very demanding - sometimes even poor, if you look at the way he repeats himself unnecessarily at passages every writing adviser would cringe at. And yet there is something powerful, endearing behind those words, something which lures you in without you even realizing it. It is impossible to describe the atmosphere within this tale. Read it for yourself if you are open for classics without a lot of action going on - and this is a short one, a story I read in the course of two hours with interruptions - or don't if you need your complex plots. For everyone else, I'd highly recommend it."}, {"userName": "Matthew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16254355-matthew", "userReview": "This was my very first Hemingway and I loved it! However, I am not sure if it broke me for future Hemingway novels. This one was so perfect in its simpleness. When I got to other Hemingway novels it was almost like there was too much in them - I wanted the basics of this book again. That is not to say that I have not enjoyed his other books, but if I had read the others first and wasn't tempted to compare them to this, I would have rated them higher.So, if you want to read lots of Hemingway, maybe don't start here. I would suggest probably A Farewell to Arms followed by The Sun Also Rises (I don't think I would recommend For Whom the Bell Tolls until you were sure you are into Hemingway)If you have always thought about reading Hemingway and you just want a taste with the chance that you may not read more, The Old Man and the Sea is a perfect place to start!"}, {"userName": "Henry Avila", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5431458-henry-avila", "userReview": "The tail, excuse me, The tale of an elderly fisherman and his not so good friend , a 1,500 lbs. marlin.

Can he battle everything the sea throws at him to land his prize?In the interest of reading a wider variety of things, I snapped this up like an eighteen-foot marlin bites a baited hook. It was definitely worth a read.The Old Man and the Sea is the tale of an Old Man. And a Sea. It's man vs. nature at its finest. Hemingway's language is spare but very powerful. I felt every wound and heartbreak along with Santiago and was nearly as worn out as the old fisherman by the end of the tale.If you haven't already had the ending spoiled for you, do yourself a favor and steer clear of introductions, reviews, and Wikipedia summaries. I knew the ending before I got there due to reading an excerpt in middle school and the experience would have been much better going in cold.What else is there to say?

Though loneliness is an unavoidable condition of our humanity, it resides in the innermost being of the self, expanding as each individual becomes aware of and confronts the ultimate experiences of life: change, upheaval, tragedy, joy, the passage of time, and death. Loneliness in this sense is not the same as suffering the loss of a loved one, or a perceived lack of a sense of wholeness or integrity. Existential loneliness is a way of being in the world, it is an ontological condition, a way of grasping for and confronting one's own subjective truth. And perhaps that\u2019s where, the man uplifts himself against seemingly odds and defines his life and thereby stick to truth of life- truth which he has defined for himself or his life per se.I struggle to put my thoughts into words about this little gem by Hemingway, it is exactly like fishing- just when you think you have grabbed the ideas and put them in assorted order, and you believe you would pull it away, it disappears in the depth of chaos and you lost it. This is what it is- a condensed prose written with the precision of a minimalist who can portray great ideas about human existence beneath the simple tales. The Old, Santiago has been going for fishing for 84 days now without success. In the first forty days a boy-Rogelio was with him. But after forty days without a fish the boy\u2019s parents had told him that old man was now definitely and finally salao. Everything about him was old except his eyes and they were the same color as the sea and were cheerful and undefeated. Perhaps that\u2019s what kept him moving despite all not getting success for a longtime. Probably it was his experience too with life- for he would have been in such situations before- which provides him strength and motivation to move forward. How easy it to lose grip of life when things are not going as you want to be, and how difficult it is to get your act together to move forward even when you \u2018believe\u2019 things are not going as you like them to be. Perhaps not so difficult, probably it is all about mindset but is it really that easy- probably not, for had it been so, there wouldn\u2019t have been no prophets, enlightened men throughout our history. Probably it requires high degree of meditation of soul to cultivate your mind in such a way that it may act as you wish- and a few have been able to do so since the outbreak of human civilization. At one level it is the tale of a man and a fish, at another, a story of man versus nature, at yet another, the story of the culture of manhood, courage, bravery in the face of existence, and at yet another a history of what life was like when individuals were more the central actors on the human stage and not groups or organizations.The Old man no longer dreams of storms, nor of women, nor of great occurrences, nor of great fish, nor fights, nor contests of strength, nor of his wife. He only dreamed of places now and of the lions on the beach.  He has stood up from petty details of life and hope to sustain through punishing life keeps him moving forward. Better to sail an ocean of hope than a sea of despair. The Old man is a dreamer, though his dreams may not have been ordinary, scuffed and sanded down by decades of fishing the Gulf Stream: no longer does his sleeping mind drift to the great events throughout his life but instead just to a place, a childhood memory: lions playing on an African beach. He is reverent but not pious, wary of devotion, although he could waver. He is a symbol of an attitude toward life. He often thinks and talks poetically and symbolically and so artificially.His relationship with nature is not usual- unusual in the sense that he thinks of sea as most people do not:-But the old man always thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great favors, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could not help them. The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.\u201dFish,\u201d he said, \u201cI love you and respect you very much. But I will kill you dead before this day ends.\u201dHe has been victim of worst form of luck- Salao, the fish may remain allusive for 84 days from him, but he sets out 85th day with hope of life, forgetting the burden of last 84 days- as one should do in life. May be today. Every day is a new day. It is better to be lucky. But I would rather be exact. Then when luck comes you are ready. He gets lucky too this time and his quarry hooked and a big fish from the hope of sea struck in his fishing net. But then true test of life begins for him, Day becomes night becomes day, and with little or no sleep the old man loses track of time and islands of Sargasso weed drift by. Eating raw bonito and dorado to maintain strength, while slowly sapping the marlin\u2019s will, Santiago regrets his poor planning: I will never go in a boat again without salt or limes. Santiago symbolizes courage, gut and perseverance- which are perhaps most important of the traits required to live the life. He will win the battle but lose the prize, and rue the desperation that carried him beyond practical bounds. He laments the ruins of his lionheart dream, and yet he remains unbowed: \u201cA man can be destroyed but not defeated.\u201d He is not only courageous. He is humble and gently proud, aware of beauty and filled with a sense of brotherhood with nature. And he has a loving heart. These attributes have not been common in Hemingway characters in the past. Since they are admirable and Mr. Hemingway admires them, the moral climate of \"The Old Man and the Sea\" is fresh and healthy and the old man's ordeal is moving. The book reflects upon some of the basic parameters of human existence- which are loneliness and recognition. Here, it builds upon Sartre\u2019s  The Other,  when the old man is fishing right in the middle of sea, the loneliness of human existence strikes him- a man may achieve insurmountable feats but he needs to someone to share the very feat; solitude may be a bliss but you need someone to discuss that it is. He looked around for the bird now because now because he would like him for company.. He develops psychological association with \u2018the fish\u2019 over a period of time as man generally becomes attached even with inanimate things if put in exile. But he is the symbolism for entire humankind, and he realizes how laws of nature work and any sort of unrequired affection may be futile in the struggle for existence. I wish I could feed the fish, he thought. He is my brother. But I must kill him and keep strong to do it. The Old man and The Sea may come across as a simple fable about an unlucky fisherman to a na\u00efve reader, but it is what it conveys beside simple arrangements of words and it is exactly the beauty of Hemingway that how he has been words with minimalist approach to portray profound subjects of humankind. The book, to me, may be said as bible of human existence, the Old man symbolizes the human attitude towards life in general; it is the tale of civilized human life and exactly what does it take to live such one- courage, love, faith, hope, and clarity. And the prose of Hemingway provides indefinite possibilities to the readers to interpret it according to their own world, how rare it is to find a piece of art which can be interpreted in every probable way, which holds true in every era, and that is what exactly Hemingway offered to the mankind. \n\n5/5"}], "description": "It is the story of an old Cuban fisherman and his supreme ordeal: a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream.
