It\u2019s out there in my reviews for anyone to see. It\u2019s one of my hobbies, a rest from the mainframe of more serious readings. Jean Johnson's Hellfire is #3 out of the 5-book Theirs Not to Reason Why saga. Being in the middle is a drawback; I know that from experience since I am a middle sister myself. So I know how hard it is to shine out in that spot. All the novelty has gone, and you know the end emotion is way in the future. Pun intended! Nevertheless, Hellfire is still a great book for us military science-fiction aficionados! Ia is back as Ship\u2019s Captain, and there is plenty of action, though a bit too aptly as she applies her 'precognition' to even the tiniest of details. For me, in Hellfire Ia simply lost part of her drive, some flair or her \u00e9lan if you will. But the last fifty pages do sizzle and lend me hope that the sequel just may bring Ia fully back to the pillar of strength and resolve that I sorely missed. And from already having read it, I can tell you it\u2019s all there. So, don\u2019t give up. Helfire is a great entertainment a pleasure to read, a 4-star book and outright recommend."}, {"userName": "Dreamthiev", "userReviewDate": "Aug 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19866947-dreamthiev", "userReview": "\"This is a bloody terrible book,\" I quipped. I really enjoyed the first book in the series, but I feel it's been going progressively downhill in the last two books. For the uninitiated, the series about Ia, the most powerful precognitive ever. After looking forward in time, she decided to become a soldier because she learned that the only way to save the future is to stop and tell every single person she meets, at least three times, how she's fated to save all life in the known galaxy. It's not just that the books are filled with repetitive phrasing and dialog (Ia keeps having essentially the same conversations over and over with practically everyone), it's also that these repetitions seem to happen instead of actual plot-advancement. While Ia having the exact same conversation for the hundredth time takes up page after page, the story leads up to encounters, battles, etc only to skip over them to another conversation where Ia convinces yet another person she's fated to blah, blah, blah all over again. Besides that, the level of Mary-Sue-ism is absurd, to the extent it's pretty much killed my suspension of disbelief. All in all, I'm through with this series."}, {"userName": "Lyndi loathes love triangles", "userReviewDate": "Aug 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5913818-lyndi-loathes-love-triangles", "userReview": "I have a hard time reconciling the fact that this series is one of my favorites, but the same author wrote a book that I wanted to beat people with and another book that I couldn't stand past 5%.

No, wait, I know exactly when it happened: when she let herself be bullied by her supposed friend and counselor Christine Benjamin into shacking up for a weekend with her hormonally resonant roommate, Meyun Harper. Now, I'm no prude; I appreciate sex as much as the next meioa, in or out of fiction. But! The effect of the coersion (though possibly not the sex itself) was devastating to Ia, sending her careening off the rails......until well into book 3 (Hellfire). There, in one particular twenty-minute (and subsequent hour) of respite from her life-long mission she CHOOSES to be with Harper. Then as if my magic - the magic of hormones, anyway - the Ia we had grown to love in Soldier's Duty and the first ten chapters of Officers Duty came back. I can only mourn that this doesn't happen until page 421 of 473. But the last fifty pages do sizzle, and lend me hope that book 4, when it arrives, just may bring Ia fully back to the pillar of strength and resolve that I sorely missed.Oh, as for the story of Hellfire - it's fine. Plenty of action, though a bit too pat as Ia applies her precognition to even the tiniest of details. Certainly a pleasure to read, and even recommend.But I regret not being able to give it that elusive 5th review star. Ia is more that the protagonist of this series, she is the meioa-e that we all must love, unconditionally, for the story to work - and you just can't feel the love when the character herself isn't sure. So, Ms. Johnson, kudos for creating a character I can enjoy, even adore on many levels...but take care. Allowing her to be side-tracked, even by her (half) humanity, runs the terrible risk of making her less than she can, and MUST, be."}, {"userName": "Marlene", "userReviewDate": "Sep 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7001837-marlene", "userReview": "Originally published at Reading RealityDamn if this isn\u2019t a middle book. It\u2019s a damned good middle book, but it is definitely a middle book, suffering from all of the attendant problems of a member of that dreaded breed. You need to have read the previous books in the Theirs Not to Reason Why series A Soldier's Duty and An Officer's Duty) and you need to wait impatiently for the next and hopefully finally book in the series, Damnation, to be published, probably next summer.It\u2019s going to be a hellishly long wait.Ia is finally the Captain of her own ship, the Terran United Peacekeepers Space Force (TUPSF) Hellfire. Her crew will come to be infamously known as Ia\u2019s Damned. She knows exactly when and in what circumstances they will acquire that nickname because Ia is a massive precognitive. Her coming has been foretold by one interplanetary religion as The Prophet of a Thousand Years. Ia has only one purpose in her life; to save the existence of all sentient races from an invasion that will wipe them from the galaxy, 300 years in the future.She walks the timeplains, always seeking the one and only one choice that has a dim chance of success. For her people. For all \u201cpeople\u201d.By the point where she takes over the Captaincy of the Hellfire, she has revealed herself to her superior officers in the TUPSF and to her crew. Forces have aligned themselves against her; not because they oppose her ultimate purpose, but because they are playing a game, and can\u2019t believe that Ia is playing for such high stakes that their game will be rendered meaningless.Hellfire is a book about the hurry up and wait involved in waging a long, slow war...because there is an enemy who comes before the ultimate enemy, and Ia has to defeat them first, so that the TUPSF still has something left when the dark days come.It turns out that even a massive precog cannot account for all the possible chances.Escape Rating A-: Notice that in the \u201cformat read\u201d section above I have both an ebook copy that I purchased and I bought a paperback at WorldCon just so I could get the author to sign it. This probably gives a hint on my thoughts about the series as a whole.Ia is a fascinating character. She knows everything, and yet, sometimes she still can\u2019t control everything, which becomes the central tension in this story. She may see all events, but she can still be tripped up by her physical limitations. She can only be in one place at one time.The story drags on in the middle by the need to describe the military logistics of the \u201churry up and wait\u201d wear and tear of a long campaign. It\u2019s a necessary part of the story but it just wasn\u2019t as interesting to this reader as focusing on the human (or Gatsugi, or any other sentient) aspects of the story.The parts that sing for me were the times when the focus closes in on specific actions. The early scene where Ia returns to her homeworld of Sanctuary and gets to seriously tweak the nose of the religious zealot bureaucracy was much too much fun.Near the end, there is a scene that should bring tears to any sentient. The aftermath of the scene explains much about the price that Ia pays for her knowledge and power. It\u2019s about page 339 in either the paperback or ebook.Ia\u2019s story is definitely being sent into the light. Read it and you\u2019ll be enthralled into understanding."}, {"userName": "Aurian Booklover", "userReviewDate": "Aug 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14328604-aurian-booklover", "userReview": "I have been waiting for this third book in the series a whole year, but it was well worth the wait. And waiting for the fourth book will take another year, and that is so killing me! Beware, gushing review follows!As Captain of her own ship, and with the Admiral-General of the Terran Forces behind her, Ia is having carte blanche in where to use her ship in fighting and ultimately destroying the Salik. As the most powerful precog ever born, Ia can see the timelines of everything than can possible happen, and what she needs to do to ensure the best possible outcome, to save the most lives. This is not easy, as sometimes she has to sacrifice people in order to save others. She knows everyone who dies, all their names, and how they die. In order to stay sane to carry this burden, she needs to stay in action, see the results what happens when she saves this colony instead of that spacestation, check the timelines time and again. She needs the trust of her crew to be able to do the most good, they need to have confidence in her abilities to guide them, and to follow her orders without hesitation. She knows the powers that be have planted some spies in her crew, but she knows who they are, and how to circumvent them if necessary. But she would prefer to sway them to support her. The Hellfire is the fastest and most deadly ship out there, and her secrets have to be kept a secret. There can be no chance of it falling into enemy hands. The canon that is the core of her ship, is capable of such destruction, when it misses its target, its fire will be deadly for months. This makes Ia the only person capable of shooting it, as she can see where her enemy will be in the next ten seconds. She has her friend and chaplain Benny with her, and some of her friends she trained in the academy, and she needs Meyun Harper in engineering, even though it will be very hard to keep her distance from him. There can be no relationship between them whatsoever, except that of good friends. She also needs him to make a weapon that will make her a full blood Feyori when the time is right, and for that, they will need to visit the Timesafe on Earth, where the Immortal stores her knowledge of the ages. Ia will need more technology than is available at the moment to be able to win the war against the Salik, and to prepare the galaxy for the next war. In the previous book she made an enemy out of one of the Feyori, and he is actively working against her now, not having a clue what her final goal is: to safe the galaxy from being destroyed 300 years from now. And this means, she needs a Feyori ally herself, something she hoped she did not have to do for a while yet.Ia also needs to be formally acknowledged as the Prophet of a Thousand Years by the V\u2019Dan, and to earn their trust and loyalty. I loved the book very much, it is chock full of action and fighting. Ia keeps helping her home planet and the rebels on it and I love to read how she thwarts the church officials. Ia is a great captain, a good leader even though she knows how to act to get the most result. Still, Harper is a mist for her, and she cannot predict him or the things around him, and it keeps her on her toes. Ia hurts for everyone she loses, for every battle she cannot fight, every hard choice she has to make. And I so admire her strength and her loyalty. Yes, the book had me in tears a few times, and laughing at other times. I was totally immersed in the story while reading. Jean Johnson\u2019s writing style is perfectly matched to my reading tastes.The ending blew me away, and I hate to have to wait a whole year for the next book. Still, if you have read my interview with Jean Johnson, she is planning plenty more books and stories to keep me a happy reader in the coming years.11 stars.\u00a9 2013 Reviews by Aurian"}, {"userName": "E.", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1573922-e", "userReview": "\u201cHellfire\u201d by Jean Johnson is part of the enthralling \u2018Theirs Not to Reason Why\u2019 science fiction series. Ia is a massive precognitive who is also known as the Prophet to some of the Feyori and has honed many of her skills, including electrokinesis and her ability to use what she calls the timeplains. She has become captain of the ship known as Hellfire which is armed with the Godstrike cannon and staffed it with a handpicked crew who are known as Ia\u2019s Damned and who become her greatest asset in the war against the Salik. Ia constantly navigates the narrow path that she sees as the only way to save the most beings in the future but she is sorely tested in her convictions, and challenged by her need to deal with the \u2018Meddlers\u2019, the Feyori who object to her half-blood connection to them. The struggle to constantly juggle a myriad of potentially fateful choices exert a horrendous pressure upon the driven female but she never loses sight of her goal, no matter how many obstacles she has to destroy, avoid or restructure. She just has to make sure she has the right beings around her at the right time. Simple for a precognitive, right? Definitely not.This exciting addition to a fantastic space opera series continues to provide a mesmerizing multi-layered read. It is exhausting to think of all of the constant consultations performed by the heroine to make sure that events are unfolding as they should and the stark example of the \u2018butterfly effect\u2019 made a significant impression, not only because it showed that Ia is capable of great emotion but it also demonstrated her dedication to her cause and willingness to put her body on the line for her beliefs. I was thrilled to see the reappearance of those important to Ia and enjoyed watching her crew (including the requisite spies) being won over to the cause. There are plenty of exciting descriptions of military engagements for those who are fond of such things but there is a beautifully emotional depiction of the price required to ensure that the final goal is feasible, no matter who it harms or how much regret is engendered. The understated humor and veiled insults that Ia wields in addition to her firm conveyance of the logic behind her actions is contrasted with the reactions evoked in those she interacts with, whether alien or human, and the exquisite way she tailors her actions to the audience. I think that it would be easy to fall into the spell woven by this wonderfully talented author if one hasn\u2019t read the rest of the series but this story is best savored by starting at the beginning with \u201cA Soldier\u2019s Duty\u201d. That way you can fall under the spell and join me as I cheer for Ia\u2019s accomplishments and mourn for her losses and anxiously await the next installment of her adventures.\u00a9 Night Owl ReviewsI received a copy of this title in return for an honest review."}, {"userName": "Frances", "userReviewDate": "Sep 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2494591-frances", "userReview": "I only have one complaint, then I will get to how awesome it was. This is mostly a complaint as to the printing, not the the writing, too. As the book was published as a paperback (and at 471 pages, no less), the copy my library received was cut in such a way that I had to bend the book in a way that adds stress to the spine just so I could read the words along the inner creases. In short, this book will not get as many reads before it gets withdrawn and recycled from my library and (hopefully) a new book will be purchased. This is great for the author, but not so much for the library. That being said, I love this story. I wish the series was in audiobook, because I think that would be really awesome (even more awesome would be if it were done as some of them, with sound effects). I was heartbroken to get to the end of this book because it is where MANY authors would have left it.

Her character growth has taken her from interesting to dull to annoying. Even while she speaks about the burden of knowing the names and fates of every person in the universe she can't save, she comes across as almost mechanical and emotionless. The only time she seems to show real emotion is when her plans almost come crashing down around her ears. There were only two real moments that saved the book from being a complete retread of the others, and one of them was the ending. I hope Ia's future is less predictable and more random. What the books are missing is mystery. I worry that by giving us so much foresight concerning Ia's goals, the author has dimished our opportunity to be surprised."}, {"userName": "DemetraP", "userReviewDate": "Jul 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6988470-demetrap", "userReview": "Ia is finally getting her higher ups in the military to respect her talents for seeing the future.

Ce tome \u00e9tait vraiment int\u00e9ressant mais il est \u00e0 la crois\u00e9e de l'histoire, la fin d'une \u00e9poque et tout juste le commencement d'une nouvelle.Ia est finalement le capitaine de son propre vaisseau le TUPSF (Terran United Peacekeepers Space Force) Hellfire. Ia est une precog, elle est capable de voyager dans ce qu'elle appelle le \"timeplan\" ou elle peut voir avec pr\u00e9cision toutes les probabilit\u00e9s de vie de chaque personne qui existe et qui existera. Elle a ainsi pr\u00e9dit une invasion massive qui arrivera environ 200 ans dans le futur et parmi toutes les voies possible, une seule et unique lui permettra de sauver l'esp\u00e8ce humaine. Depuis elle a mit en place son plan et elle s'y tiens.Mais \u00e9videmment \u00e7a n'est pas facile quand on fait parti d'une force arm\u00e9e, de devoir justifier \u00e0 chaque fois toute ses actions sans trop en d\u00e9voiler de peur que certaines personnes modifient leur comportement en sachant ce qu'il va arriver. Heureusement depuis qu'elle c'est d\u00e9voil\u00e9e comme \u00e9tant \"The Prophet of a Thousand Years\" qui est une des composante de la religion V'Dan (qui sont les humains avec des pouvoirs), ils ont d\u00e9cid\u00e9 de lui faire plus ou moins confiance en lui donnant une carte blanche lui permettant d'agir plus ou moins \u00e0 sa guise du moment qu'elle assure la victoire des humains dans la prochaine guerre qui se pr\u00e9cise contre les Salik.Les Salik sont des pr\u00e9dateurs marins, ils vivent avec la loi du plus fort et pour eux la vie n'a aucune valeur sentimentale. Ils sont arriv\u00e9s dans la partie humaine de la galaxie il y a environ 200 ans, il se trouve qu'ils fuient justement la menace qui va d\u00e9truire les humains et qui a d\u00e9truit leur propre galaxie. Depuis ils veulent vraiment s'installer sur place et devenir l'esp\u00e8ce dominante, reprendre leur place en gros. Ils ont \u00e9t\u00e9 repouss\u00e9 une premi\u00e8re fois lors de leur arriv\u00e9e et depuis un cess\u00e9 le feu plus ou moins permanent a \u00e9t\u00e9 mis en place. Mais en vrai pour eux la guerre ne c'est jamais termin\u00e9e vu qu'ils n'ont pas r\u00e9ussi leur coup. Et depuis, alors que les humains se pensaient en paix, ils ont reb\u00e2ti leur force, et l'ont rendu bien plus massive qu'avant. Lorsque ce tome d\u00e9bute la guerre n'est pas encore install\u00e9e mais justement les actions du Hellfire vont la d\u00e9voiler aux yeux des humains, montrant que les Salik ont envahi la zone tampon et s'en servent pour stocker des armes et des \"nurseries\" de futurs soldats produits \u00e0 la chaine (ils naissent dans des \u0153ufs).Nous sommes ici dans de la SF militaire, pleine de codes et de r\u00e8gles et ou Ia utilise vraiment son vaisseau et son \u00e9quipage comme arme. Elle les a choisi pour \u00e7a, des personnes n'ayant aucun impact sur le futur, donc des pions parfait et sacrifiable si il le faut (elle n'h\u00e9sitera pas), tout en \u00e9tant capable de suivre les ordre et d'\u00eatre bon dans leur domaine respectif.Le protocole militaire est tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9sent tout au long du tome, et tr\u00e8s contraignant aussi, du coup on passe r\u00e9guli\u00e8rement par des meetings et autres rapports.En fait pourquoi je dis que ce tome est un tome interm\u00e9diaire? Parce qu'il n'y a pas vraiment d'histoire pour le personnage d'Ia et de son \u00e9quipage ici mais plus une \u00e9volution g\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la situation du monde alors que la guerre se met progressivement en place. Du coup il se pr\u00e9sente plus comme une suite d'actions qui se lit comme une succession de nouvelles les unes \u00e0 la suite des autres. Toutes ayant une objectif diff\u00e9rent et nous expliquant une partie des actions du Hellfire et en quoi elles seront importantes pour la suite. On est totalement dans une ambiance qui alterne les longues attentes pour agir au bon moment suivi d'une successions d'actions tr\u00e8s pr\u00e9cises qui doivent \u00eatre ex\u00e9cut\u00e9es parfaitement pour ne pas tout g\u00e2cher ...Du coup c'est tr\u00e8s \u00e9parpill\u00e9 comme r\u00e9cit m\u00eame si \u00e7a reste bien sur totalement fascinant je trouve.En plus il faut se rendre compte que je n'ai racont\u00e9 ici qu'une partie de la situation initiale qui est en fait plus complexe que \u00e7a au niveau des vrai plans d'Ia. Du coup la quantit\u00e9 d'informations est assez monumentale pour une s\u00e9rie du genre. Il y a tout de m\u00eame une histoire centrale bien sur qui revient de temps en temps, et qui concerne un autre point du r\u00e9cit que je ne vous d\u00e9voilerai pas pour ne pas tout spoiler non plus. D'ailleurs vu comme ce termine ce tome, on sent que le prochain sera centr\u00e9 dessus et qu'on reprendra donc un type de r\u00e9cit plus normal et moins coup\u00e9 comme dans les premiers tomes de la s\u00e9rie. On pourrait croire que c'est trop facile pour Ia vu qu'elle sait tout \u00e0 l'avance mais en fait non pas du tout, elle surf avec la limite \u00e0 chaque fois. Il lui faut par exemple maintenir en vie une personne bien pr\u00e9cise lors d'une bataille spatiale chaotique ou infiltrer discr\u00e8tement une zone pour poser des camera lors d'une mission plus diplomatique. Elle prend des d\u00e9cisions difficiles en permanence comme par exemple ne pas aller sauver la famille d'un de ses amis parce qu'on a plus besoin d'elle ailleurs au m\u00eame moment.En gros tout ce qu'elle fait est bas\u00e9 sur des minutieux calculs de rentabilit\u00e9s sur le nombre de personnes qu'elle sauvera ou pas et l'importance des personnes en question sur le futur, suivant l'action qu'elle choisi de faire. Du coup c'est vrai que des fois elle parait limite inhumaine. Son vaisseau participe au grand jeu de sa vie, et son objectif est bien plus important que sa vie ou celle de son \u00e9quipage, voir de celles de plan\u00e8tes enti\u00e8re. Je dois dire que ce genre d'histoire marche vraiment bien chez moi. Il y a ce \"facteur Waou\" que je retrouve par exemple dans les Craft Sequence, ce cot\u00e9 \u00e9merveillement qui est tr\u00e8s fort quand on commence \u00e0 se faire une vrai id\u00e9e de l'histoire g\u00e9n\u00e9rale et de sa complexit\u00e9.Encore une fois j'ai donc vraiment bien appr\u00e9ci\u00e9 ma lecture. Apr\u00e8s c'est vrai que si ce tome met en place la suite il \u00e9tait un peu plus long \u00e0 lire du fait de sa forme.J'ai conscience que ce genre de r\u00e9cit n'est pas pour tout le monde mais pour moi \u00e7a fonctionne tr\u00e8s bien, je suis prise du d\u00e9but \u00e0 la fin et j'ai du mal \u00e0 m'y remettre une fois fini, je suis limite essouffl\u00e9e tellement j'ai retenu mon souffle.17/20"}, {"userName": "Moira", "userReviewDate": "Jun 01, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5694594-moira", "userReview": "1.6.2017 - 3,5*Bylo to... m\u00edsty v\u00e1\u017en\u011b nudn\u00e9.

We\u2019ve seen how Iantha Quentin-Jones joined the Terran United Planets armed forces and how she set about creating a legend of her actions and her name, such that it would carry down through the ages to the moments that mattered most. A full-scale intergalactic invasion by a ravenous species the likes of which have never been seen before.Iantha, or Ia as she chooses to call herself from the moment that she joins the armed forces, has seen it all in precognitive visions and she\u2019s taken up the responsibility to guide the galaxy to a point where it can have the barest chance of resisting the invaders, perhaps even win through. Employing all her psychic skills to full effect, but working under the letter of intergalactic and army law for the most part, she has made some great inroads.And now she is finally reached a fulcrum moment, where she actively participates in the new Salik War where her superiors are fully cognizant of her special abilities and (in the broadest sense) know what she is doing.By the time Hellfire starts, Ia\u2019s plans are well on their way and we finally get to a point where we can truly see some big space battles, of the kind that Star Trek and Star Wars and other such large-scale space opera franchises are known for. We don\u2019t see many of them, but we do see two fairly important ones, and those were well the price of admission, so to speak.As always, I loved Jean\u2019s characterisation of Ia and her supporting cast. This is Ia\u2019s third outing and by now I\u2019m very well familiar with her as a character, which helped put a lot of her actions into the proper context for me. If you haven\u2019t read any of the previous books, then you are most likely going to be lost here since you are going to be missing out on a lot of character development that has already happened and a lot of Ia\u2019s decisions, or the references to events in the previous books will not make as much sense as they would otherwise. I\u2019ve remarked before that in Ia Jean has created a really wonderful character, a protagonist with agency who always deals on her own terms and is able to twist her way out difficult situations when called for. Sure, she has to finagle her way past a ton of obstacles in the process, but then that\u2019s the charm. Everything in the novel is not just about the characters themselves, or the situations or what have you, its about the execution.And Jean definitely excels at that.There is one particular moment, during the second major space battle in the novel, where all of Ia\u2019s careful planning is burned up in engine exhaust because of the carelessness of a crew member. Suddenly, its like dominoes are falling. That moment gives the most in-depth emotional look into Ia as a character. Till now, we\u2019ve always seen her at her best, at her most confident, even arrogant. And now she learns some true humility. Through this entire scene, Jean also shows something that we\u2019ve only heard Ia speak of before in a passing manner: that there is always a chance that something wrong will happen, no matter how miniscule. There\u2019s only so much that Ia can do, she can inspire, she can lead, she can guide, but ultimately the individuals themselves have to do something too, and she can\u2019t always\u2026 control that properly. And that\u2019s what happens here, ruining almost all her work that she\u2019s done ever since she first had her visions as a teenager.Its a crystallizing moment in her character development, and we see just how she rises to the incredible challenge and beats it, saving herself and the galaxy by the skin of its teeth. Everything that she has done has been for a purpose and every individual she commands aboard the Hellfire is vital to her plans. And yet, one small mistake, one small carelessness can bring everything crashing down. To use a flowery, descriptive metaphor, Ia beats this challenge as if she is a phoenix rising from the ashes. Given the consequences, it is an apt metaphor I believe.One thing that made this novel stand out more than the other two novels was Ia\u2019s interactions with everyone around her. On one level, we have her interactions with her the men and women under her command, the crew of the Hellfire, the titular ship that is Ia\u2019s chosen weapon and steed during the Salik War. We see a lot of how she interacts with everyone as both a Captain and as a fellow soldier and as a human being. And this ties into the aforementioned event which throws all her plans into ruination. A very sobering moment in the entire novel. If you remember the scene from the first (and only good one) Starship Troopers movie where during a live-fire exercise Rico\u2019s decisions lead to the death of a fellow infantryman, and his punishment that follows, you\u2019ll have some idea of what Ia has to go through to ensure the loyalty and respect of her crewmates."}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Jul 14, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27324982-john", "userReview": "A real space soap opera!
