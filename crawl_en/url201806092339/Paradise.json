I get the impression that maybe I should have started with something a little more essential, but this was a quick, fun read.An aging architect named Simon is recently divorced from his wife. One night at a bar he catches the tail end of a lingerie show, and makes friendly with three models from Colorado. Without much explanation as to the why or how of it, Barthelme throws them all in Simon's large apartment in New York City, where they all share a rather quirky lifestyle together. Despite how gratuitous the plot may seem, Barthelme casually avoids indulging in it as a typical male fantasy. Simon's character is far too nihilistic or apathetic to function as the archetypal male reaction. What's endearing about him is his rather pragmatic perspective, possibly a bi-product of having more money than he knows what to do with. He is a man who is genuinely confused when accused of malice, one content with drinking cheap wine, cooking, having sex, and smoking cigarettes. However far his potential can extend is something that he is unconcerned with. It almost seems accidental that he is even an architect.The chapters are nice and short, each one reading like a comic punchline. They alternate between Simon's life with the three women, and his absurdist dialogues with someone who appears to be his psychiatrist. If I had to think of a subtext for the novel, I might say that Simon is supposed to be the anti-hero of eighties excess. This could possibly be why Barhtelme is choosing such a ridiculously idyllic premise. I think that the plot would be far more laughable if Barthelme were seriously exploring the dynamic there because it's sort of funny how it causes as much a reaction from some readers as Simon's apathy seems to provoke from the three models. Still, Paradise is an inconsequential book. Which to some extant is probably intentional. I just wonder what the intention is?"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 27, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/439937-jim", "userReview": "You'd think a book about a middle-aged architect cohabiting with a harem of three models would be Paradise itself, but in the end I was disappointed in the garden. I didn't much care for the dialogue, in fact, didn't really even care for the premise. I wasn't all that impressed with the writing either. It is a quick read, and it has some funnier moments, and it kind of represented some of the lifestyles engaged in during that era. Almost like he was having a midlife fantasy, and decided to write it down. I was also dismayed by the, what I felt was, unrealistic conversation between the counselor and the protagonist. Really, I didn't feel there was much here that enlightened or made me feel anything."}, {"userName": "\u041c\u0430x Nestelieiev", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20100683-x-nestelieiev", "userReview": "\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0431\u0448\u0438\u0439 \u0456\u0437 \u0439\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0447\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0440\u044c\u043e\u0445 \u0440\u043e\u043c\u0430\u043d\u0456\u0432. \u0421\u0430\u0439\u043c\u043e\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043f\u0438\u0432 \u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0439, \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u0436\u0435 \u0432\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0438\u0432 \u0404\u0432\u0443 \u0437 \u0434\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043d\u043e\u044e \u0456 \u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044c \u043c\u0430\u0454 \u0442\u0440\u044c\u043e\u0445 \u0434\u0456\u0432\u0447\u0430\u0442. \u0421\u0430\u0439\u043c\u043e\u043d - \u0430\u0440\u0445\u0456\u0442\u0435\u043a\u0442\u043e\u0440, \u0430\u043b\u0435 \u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u043d\u0430\u0437\u0438\u0432\u0430\u0454 \u0436\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0444\u043e\u043c \u0430\u0431\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u043e\u043c. \u043c\u043e\u0432\u043d\u043e \u0434\u0456\u0432\u0447\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0433\u0435\u0442\u044c \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0440\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0456, \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044f \u0442\u0435\u0436 \u043f\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0434\u0431\u0430\u0447\u0430\u0454\u0442\u044c\u0441\u044f \u0432\u0456\u0434\u043f\u043e\u0447\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0443. \u043d\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u0433\u0456\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0456\u0441\u0442\u044e, \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0431\u043d\u0430 \u043b\u044e\u0431\u043e\u0432, \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0454 \u0441\u0435\u043a\u0441, \u043a\u043e\u043c\u0443 \u043f\u043e\u0442\u0440\u0456\u0431\u0435\u043d \u043f\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043c\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0440\u043d\u0456\u0437\u043c, \u043a\u043e\u043b\u0438 \u0432\u0436\u0435 \u0431\u0443\u0432 \u0411\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u043b\u043c\u0456."}, {"userName": "Jason Jordan", "userReviewDate": "Mar 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/983325-jason-jordan", "userReview": "During my stint as book reviewer here at decomP, I've tried to limit my reviews to contemporary writings such as books published within the last 10 years.

Ever the prolific writer, Barthelme published several novels and collections during his lifespan, with this specific release arriving about three years before his death in 1989. As an experimental author, he was way ahead of his time, breaching avant-garde territory continuously, while his brothers Frederick and Steven also entered the writing/teaching field.

Rather short, otherwise I might not have finished it, for it is entertaining enough for a short format, not sufficient for an epic novel.-\tIs this about Paradise?-\tYou bet it is, for:-\tA fifty three years old man lands three stunning young models in his apartment to\u2026live with him-\tWhat else can beat that?-\tAnd yet, this is a strange heaven, described in a modernistic, if fortunately not altogether absurd mannerThe characters are- Simon, the architect hero who happens to Stumble Upon Happiness, you might say, when he meets three exhilarating women in need of a place to stay, which\u2026Bismillah \u2013in the words of the Koran and the Bohemian Rhapsody- he has available and they all come together to talk, have hot sex and then argue over nothing in particular.The three women are \u2013 Veronica, Anne and Dore, but I never knew who is who and did not care frankly.They have reminded me of my own heaven, in terms of gorgeous creatures that I was blessed to hook with. Apart from a Miss Romania, who could be considered a nec plus ultra, there have been two other fabulous creatures, who were even better than the Miss and by a weird stroke of luck, I happened to know them and enter a relationship with at about the same time. To add to the weirdness of the situation, they had the same name, albeit one was called by friends Nicky, while the other was Nicole.It sort of worked, because one was a virgin having sex, but wanting to preserve the \u201ctechnical innocence\u201d at all costs, including me seeing other women, while the other had a boyfriend with West German citizenship, who was going to marry her and so the affair was meant to be just that- a short term sexual camaraderie, albeit we kind of fell for each other.In this other Paradise, the one from the book does not fit together either, because it is too postmodern and outr\u00e9 for my tasteVery often I had a feeling of alienation, perhaps increased by the questions and answers that appear to be evocative of an analyst who talks to our architect.The architects Pei, Gehry and others make sense, but thrown in are sentences that lack meaning, or more likely I just miss it.There is hot sex and that obviously I could not miss, with felatios, sex in the kitchen- which is supposed to be a female fantasy\u2026There is the bizarre, with references to the clitoris, which apparently was unknown to the hero up to the age of twenty.Then there is the furniture which is supposed to be in heaven and it would be by Kroll- not that I know who that might beThe architecture as thought by Corbusier, Gropius no longer exists, with its meaning of improving human beings or something like that.In descriptions that I do not know if I should believe: Wright had his cape and Mies his pinstripes. Another good thing that happened during the reading of this book- I have read that one of the super-hot women keeps in shape with a trampoline and I remembered that we have one and so I have started using it again today, after \u2013 I do not know, eight years?There is a question though:-\tHow, or better said -why did I start reading this book?-\tLooking up on the net- where else? \u2013 I found a day later why- it was a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize, even if the same internet says in another place that this is the least appreciated of the author\u2019s books"}, {"userName": "Mateo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 24, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/277214-mateo", "userReview": "I like Donald Barthelme. I like Donald Barthelme because he made it acceptable for Serious Modern Fiction to be funny, goofy even, even nutty. I like that he was doing serious work while, basically, making it look like he was goofing around, doodling in class. Despite the best efforts of Updike, Vonnegut, Pynchon, and a few others, modern fiction has too often been a depressing, gray pond full of dissolving suburban marriages, broken up by the occasional oppressed Third World orphan. So it's a pleasure to read serious writing that's trying to make you laugh. Paradise tackles an old question: what if your fantasies came true? In this case, what if you were a middle-aged divorcee who suddenly found himself rooming with three gorgeous, smart, and sexually willing lingerie models? Wouldn't that be GREAT? Wouldn't that be paradise? Or would it turn out to be Paradise, where, after all, you're still middle-aged, and divorced, and a little confused, and not quite up to the mark of dealing with three complex, sometimes difficult, often ordinary human beings? At its best, Paradise manages to hit the same sweet spot of melancholy and silliness that Vonnegut perfected, and that Richard Brautigan nearly perfected. And yet, for all its keen humor, I found that halfway through the book it felt a little labored; the humor felt less funny than arch, and the randomness more pointed than inspired. There were metaphors being bandied about that I couldn't catch, or symbols, or maybe there weren't; it was hard to tell under the literary-ness of it all. All those moments that seem unsatisfied with being merely funny, but had to be High Lit funny, they began to take their toll (Barthelme's tic of using run-on sentences seems less quirky than patronizing to me it made things hard to read I mean this isn't Finnegans here), and by the end, I didn't care, really when or where the end would come. Still, despite the emphasis on literary experimentation, there's some good and funny stuff here."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Dec 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5896190-andrew", "userReview": "The book reads like an afternoon reverie, is it transpiring or just the kindest of fantasies? While not likely to supplant the necessary core collectible that is Sixty Stories, this is my favorite of the great comic writer's novels. Modest, absurd and imperturbable in its art, the novel is tinged with a male menopausal sadness. The novel virtually drifts away, in a cloud of jokes and resigned wisdom, like a favorite uncle who no longer visits. Better, though, with a stab, to simply cite the master:Simon wanted very much to be a hearty, optimistic American, like the President, but on the other hand he did not trust hearty, optimistic Americans, like the President. He had considered the possibility that the President, when not in public, was not really hearty and optimistic but rather a gloomy, obsessed man with a profound fear of the potentially disastrous processes in which he was enmeshed, no more sanguine than the Fisher King. He did not really believe that to be the case. He himself had settled for being a competent, sometimes inventive architect with a tragic sense of brick. Brick was his favorite material as the fortress was the architectural metaphor that that he had, more and more, to resist. To force himself into freshness, he thought about bamboo."}, {"userName": "Samson LeFerg", "userReviewDate": "Nov 19, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/37122169-samson-leferg", "userReview": "What's that, Barthelme was a miniaturist? Best at the short stuff, where his goofball pomo antics and non-sequitur-laden dialog could make its quick and wily impact on the reader before zipping out the door? Sure, that's probably true, but this novel (really a novella I guess) is very good. I give it 5 stars because I am grading it on my own personal bias-scale where a 4 star Barthelme book is better than a 5 star book by most others. My favorite parts of this book: the Q and A sections, a Barthelme specialty, in which a therapist of sorts grills Simon about his experiences with the three women, often inserting his own twisted, lustful psyche into the dialog in ways that are decidedly un-shrink-like; the frequent references to jazz, including the brief bit where Simon tries to list \"ten additional drummers\" and \"twenty bass players\" in his head because \"our nation is rich in talent, he thinks,\" or when he tries to imagine what Christian rock would sound like if Dodo Marmarosa were playing it; and, finally, Barthelme's satire of the aging white man and his \"hog heaven\" sexual fantasies, in a story that is both parts feminist and anti-feminist, radically egalitarian and casually sexist, snort out loud funny on every page and bleakly dark just as often."}, {"userName": "wally", "userReviewDate": "Aug 15, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4268560-wally", "userReview": "\"...he found a red wrinkled bra hanging like a cut throat over the shower rail and not knowing what else to do with it, threw that out too.\"i enjoy barthelme...what's that commercial...guy gets slapped....with aftershave is it? thanks...i needed that...yeah, so this guy, simon, who is like 53, finds himself living w/three lingerie models who gave all their money, $3000 buckeroose i guess, to stop african hunger....and i saw something in the local rag, some guys in the saviour of the seas land carrying their 5 and 7 yr old dead sons for burial.....sprinkled through the book, the chapters...there are these other chapters q&a, simon, i take it, and another...if the other was ever identified definitively, i missed it...but there's these q&a chapters that talk about the past....the 3 have moved on by the time the story opens....and so on...all in all, a satisfying read, though i've enjoyed some other barthelme stuff more so...this was entertaining and so forth and so more.good read. too bad, this man lived what 58 years? nice, how he constructed some of the dialogue sentences, writing them out like people talk, no commas just the straight hash you want beans with that?"}, {"userName": "John", "userReviewDate": "Jun 12, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/544978-john", "userReview": "A bit hard to know where to begin in commenting about this novel. It was a glimpse into everyman's erotic-middleage-crisis-dream written in a non-linear free flowing James Joyce like style, with much of the thematic material advanced thru choppy dialogue. In this book, Simon, an adulterous 53 year old architect recently seperated from his wife and is taking a sabbitical from work in NYC when out of nowhere he meets and invites to live with him three linegerie models. A bit stereotypically, he engages each of them sexually, continuously. Despite this sophomoric plot, there are hidden turns deeper than the youth-beauty vs. age-wisdom argument. I think that many of the more cryptic meanings that Berthelme was trying to get across to the reader were largely lost on me.

What results is like Three's Company on crack, as Barthelme sends up 1980s sexual and gender politics, and the relationship of the artist to his subject, craft and audience. Funny, deftly ironic and heartfelt, Paradise is ultimately a novel of sadness, of languid reflection on the past and the fleeting nature of time.

The novel does objectify women, though the objectification feels more a reflection of society than the characters involved. The writing has Barthelme's signature flare for the compelling and obscure, and also many moments of wit, but the novel ultimately failed to deliver. It's told in collage form, alternating between in-scene moments and dialogues. The only character the reader can truly get a sense of is Simon, and he comes off as half-formed.
