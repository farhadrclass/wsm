Vogt's book, written in 1948,shows its age, but is important historically and as a point of reference for thinking about how we treat the world. He stresses two themes throughout: conservation of natural resources and control of population growth. He is brash in his argumentation on both points. Indeed, his fervor is echoed today in the horrid scenarios painted by the global warming community. Vogt's contention was that the planet could not survive the continued growth of population beyond the then level of 3 billion people. We are now at 7 billion, and growing; the planet is still surviving.At heart, Vogt was a believer in Malthus's theory that the population would outgrow its food supply. Technology has staved off that outcome, so far, but Vogt believed that relief was short lived as we continued to degrade the basic productive capacity of our soil and other resources. He first makes his case on the United States experience, then reviews the even worse situation around the world. He drew on his own experience working abroad, as well as on current research, statistics, and interaction with scientists and policy makers. Key problems he identified were loss of topsoil by poor farming practices and crop selection, severe erosion, siltation of rivers, and loss of water supply. Additionally he cites loss of forest resources at home and abroad, and the scant attention paid to wildlife protection. All of these were problems domestically and worldwide.While these problems could be addressed with dollars, trained resource managers and scientists, and education of the public, the underlying, difficult to address problem was overpopulation. His words and attitude are harsh. He refers to malaria and sleeping sickness as useful checks. He condones medical and food supplies to overpopulated areas to \"save ten million today so that fifty million more would die in ten years.\" Of one country he wrote, \"perhaps the greatest asset is its high death rate.\"Another GoodReads reviewer has correctly noted that Vogt got a number of things wrong. His pessimistic predictions of the future are truly far off in some cases. For instance, he writes that China, \"quite literally cannot feed more people.\" While many did starve under Mao's wild leadership, China's population today is higher. Laughably, in light of trade today, Vogt wrote, \"Foreign areas that can supply food are not likely to buy Chinese products in sufficient amounts to take care of considerably increased numbers of empty stomachs.\" Referencing India and China he wrote, \"Large external markets will not be available for the products of Eastern industry.\" Making long term predictions can leave you hanging out there. Having said that, the truth remains that many of the world's resources are finite. and that there is more to gain than to lose by managing those resources sustainably. Hyperbolically couched, that is the point Vogt makes. He writes: \"At a time when our school system threatens to break down because we cannot pay teachers a decent wage, or support hospitals to care for the sick, we are urged to spend billions on people too stupid to stay off the flood plains, and on damming rivers that have got out of hand largely because of destruction of forests and grasslands.\" Anti-corporate voices will be pleased with his comment that, \"free enterprise must bear a large share of the responsibility for devastated forests, vanishing wildlife, crippled ranges, a gullied continent, and roaring flood crests. Free enterprise--divorced from biophysical understanding and social responsibility.\" However, the problems is more universal, for in \"Russia, the police state has not yet found the way to sound land use.\" The Congress also comes in for criticism for it is heavily populated by lawyers who, \"know as little of biophysical law as the average biologist does of corporation law,\" noting that , \"they have still not learned that we need to know what we are doing.\" Amen."}, {"userName": "Kevin", "userReviewDate": "Sep 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17402671-kevin", "userReview": "Well written, interesting, but he was wrong about so many things.
