We had a cattle ranch in southeast Wyoming and he was doing some of his ranching research with us. I was just a teenager then, but I remember him vividly. He asked the sort of question that would allow someone to respond thoughtfully and in great length. He would smile and listen and never write anything down, but I could see him filing away every word that was spoken. He read at least 200 books for every book he wrote. He would spend a couple years researching, asking questions, and getting to know peoples' stories for every book he wrote. Many of the ranching stories in Centennial came from historical events that happened on our ranch. He was a remarkable man. I miss looking forward to his next book."}, {"userName": "Duane", "userReviewDate": "Jan 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/24389390-duane", "userReview": "You could take a university course in the History of the American West and not learn as much as you can from this completely thorough fictional history by James Michener. His background research is as detailed as any writer in the genre. And he has the skill to fold those details, that history, into a fictional story that makes history come to life. I've read most of his novels and they are all exceptional, but the three that really stand out for me are Hawaii, Centennial, and The Covenant."}, {"userName": "Gary", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/51196399-gary", "userReview": "A magnificent epic of a book set in Colorado in the USA from prehistoric times to 1974.

The historic details, interweaving of plots, and lifelike characters were a collective thing of beauty. I did note that Michener left a couple of loose ends (Ethan Grebe, to start), and seemed to forget to color up a character who fascinated me (Tim Grebe). The character was toward the end of the book - maybe he just got tired of writing and wanted to finish it already? What pissed me off, however, was a distinct sanctimoniousness. In addition to crappy dialogue in the modern sections (\"Because he sends me, you old prude!\" Really? People talked like that?), I'm guessing based on the tone of this book that the 70s were full of people wandering around and wailing about the state of the natural environment at the hands of the evil, evil homo sapiens. The opening chapters about the natural development of the landscape and the early inhabiting species and migrations and such were fascinating. It was fine when it was only the Native Americans there because apparently they understood the world and were in harmony with absolutely everything. But then the white man comes along and it's all downhill from there! Because of civilization, the rivers are polluted and the landscape is stripped, and the natural fauna are exterminated, and everyone is oppressed, oppressed I say! I'm not denying that it happened, I just object to the tone. My heart ached during the passages about exterminating the buffalo and trapping the beaver into oblivion, and I came near to tears about the abuse of the Arapaho. But seriously, did the settlers do ANYTHING right? Were they all evil, selfish, heartless people except for a thin handful of protagonists that I can count on one hand? Are only descendants of Native Americans able to see and be dismayed by what kind of disaster has been wrought?I know the book was written 35 years ago. I know that vast advancements have been made in the way things are handled out there in the past 35 years, possibly as a result of things like this book. But I don't like reading a novel and coming away from it hating myself for being a human and thus related in any way - including merely sharing a species - to the people that performed these atrocities. I was depressed and angry for the rest of the day. The 70s must have been an utterly miserable decade - thank god I missed most of them."}, {"userName": "Stacy", "userReviewDate": "May 12, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/55502227-stacy", "userReview": "Another of my favorite author's-- I have yet to read one of his books I didn't thoroughly enjoy.

At 280 pages, I'm nearly one-third of the way through, and enjoying it very much. Michener packs a heck of a lot of historical detail into the narrative, but as I said in my original comments below, this novel seems to have better pacing than some of the more formulaic ones that were to follow.8/27/15: Michener has often been accused of cardboard characters in his epics, but I don't find that to be true of CENTENNIAL - many of the characters are larger-than-life, but the ordinary folk are quite well-drawn and believable.8/31/15: Just under 200 pages left to go, and we've finally reached the early years of the 20th Century. This novel is a reminder that in his relentless drive westward, the white man was unforgivably inconsiderate to Native Americans as well as some of the wildlife, such as the buffalo, and we're still paying a price for these actions today. 9/04/15: Finished it. Although the final chapter flags a bit as Michener ties it all together, my Five-Star rating still stands, as does my opinion that CENTENNIAL is the overall best of Michener's historical epics. There were times when I felt I'd been dropped into one of the great screen westerns by John Ford or Howard Hawks.\nMy original comments:\nAlthough I haven't re-read it in full since the mid-1970s (when I read it twice), CENTENNIAL probably remains my favorite novel by Michener, who for many years was my favorite novelist. This was only the third of his really \"big\" novels (preceded by HAWAII and THE SOURCE) and the formula wasn't quite set in stone yet. This one had, I thought, great \"sweep\" to it (like HAWAII, it begins with the very creation of the land on which the story will unfold, and its earliest inhabitants), and some fascinating characters - Michener's powers as a storyteller were at their peak here (despite one or two reviewers who regarded it as a snooze-fest)."}, {"userName": "Trisha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1300121-trisha", "userReview": "I chose this book because I have decided to take a literary tour of the United States. Having been to the south with Eudora Welty and the Optimist's Daughter, I decided to go West. And I couldn't have chosen a better guide than Michener (whom I have never read before.) I was absolutely fascinated by the details and historical information - beginning way back some billion years ago when the cooling earth began to shape itself into what is now known as Colorado. Each chapter of this book was like reading a separate novel except that they all fit together in one sweeping progression that took me from the age of the dinosaurs right on through to the present time. I grew attached to all of the characters - even the beavers, the horses and the buffalo but especially the people - the Indians, the settlers, the fur traders, the cattle Ranchers, cowbows, hunters, farmers, even the scoundrels, swindlers and politicians - because they were so carefully portrayed. But this wasn't primarily an epic story about people and families (although it was fun watching them or their descendants show up from one era to the next)It was an epic story about the west itself and what happened there over the thousands and thousands of years that have made it what it is.

Try this one. Michener details the story of a Colorado settlement, Centennial, from the geology and the prehistoric animals all the way up to the modern day. There's native Americans, the trappers and early settlers, cattle ranching vs. sheep herding, con artists, the circus coming to town, the horrors of the Dust Bowl, and the modern problems of today. Most poignant is the fate of the Arapaho people, endlessly lied to and persecuted by the American government and military. To his credit, Michener spares the reader little of that atrocious time in history, and gives a great read in the meantime. Five stars overall and a must recommend.

The book starts in the distant past and moves forward through the Native Americans, the fur trappers, the settlers, the ranchers and many more. I expected the book to be centered in the Rocky Mountains, since that is what I think of when I think of Colorado, but here, the Rockies mostly form a backdrop.The book is long and a bit slow-going in spots--not for the faint-hearted.

I enjoy Michener's books and have had this one sitting on my shelf for a while. I'm glad I waited to read it. I never could have appreciated it as well if I hadn't spent some time living and traveling out west. The history and themes of this book have become some of my favorites to read about over the past few years. It was a pleasure to read a fictionalized account of historical topics I enjoy, including the Dust Bowl period and, of course, the cattle drives. But I enjoyed also the new and detailed perspectives about Native American history and the history of \"outside\" cultures in this area - Mexicans, Japanese, and Russians, for example. I love books about the west because they exemplify all the great things about the human spirit, and because they are closely connected to the land. Finally, I appreciated the author's clear concern for environmental issues and for being ahead of his time. I live in the west, and water shortages and smog are very real issues that still haven't been adequately addressed. James Michener addressed them at length, and other issues related to stewardship of the land, when this book was published over 40 years ago.

James A. Michener invites the reader to be a fellow traveler from the first animals to first humans to the modern chaos that is the American West. His characters are very human, often flawed, and mostly fighters to survive a land under tremendous pressures from with in and without. He begins with the the story of the Arapaho, Lame Beaver and the courier dubois-Pasquinel, who trades with the Indians while living a free life even though he has two familes and two sets of children-- he is the epitome of a long gone man-- free, able to travel and very much the individual. Michener's characters are from all walks of life, Levi Zendt a former Quaker, Jake Pasquinel son of Pasquinel and his brother --both conflicted for being both Indian and white which lays the ground work for the entire novel. This novel in the end is about identity and change-- should you stay with your culture? Should you live a new life? Should you go on the journey or stay home? This novel is one of my favorites-- I read it in honor of my Dad who instilled in me--a love of the American West-- it's land, people and evolving history.If you feel like getting lost and finding the real west-- take the Centennial Journey with James A.

We alternated between listening to the audiobook version (my first real introduction to audiobooks) and cramming in some nighttime reading in various cities such as Richmond, Nashville, Winston-Salem, Raleigh - Durham, and so on. Centennial is the kind of book that will make you want to gouge your eyes out at its tediousness, however it is also the kind of book that will force your respect by its attention to detail and intricate (and subtle) plot developments. I have never read any other Michener, however nothing can possibly top this. You follow cowboys, fur trappers, Native Americans, etc., through time and eventually Michener\u2019s story weaves together to form a fantastic and cohesive description of Americana.

For years a friend has been suggesting I read Centennial, and now I see why. Michener has created lush stories with engaging characters. With each chapter, I became friends with a new set of characters and when they would show up in later chapters, it felt good to see them again. It is apparent that the book is well researched, although only rarely does Michener go overboard with showing you how much he knows. This is one of those books I did not want to put down at night, and in the morning, I picked it up as soon as my eyes adjusted to the light.Centennial missed a perfect score from me for two reasons. There are two chapters early on which go into exhaustive depth on the geological and living histories of the west. Some information would have been okay, but there was just too much for me. Then, as the story entered the 20th century, the storytelling began to fall apart a bit. I just didn't care as much about the characters, and there were too many stories being told at the same time. Oddly enough, with over 1000 pages, the end felt a bit rushed. Great care was taken earlier in the book to craft the stories. Towards the end, I got the feeling that it was time to \"wrap it up\" but Michener had too much more to say. Perhaps this could have been two books, then Michener could have fully explored all of his time periods fully.Even with the drawback chapters, I would highly recommend Centennial to anyone. Even if they felt intimidated by the page count, I would say to just not worry about it, the story will fully support you through the journey."}, {"userName": "Evan", "userReviewDate": "Jun 19, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1248986-evan", "userReview": "Stories set against historical backdrops or that contain historical threads in some manner -- OK, I'm all right with those. But, in general, the idea of historical fiction makes me bristle. The notion of reading a speculative history such as, say, Lincoln by Gore Vidal versus, say, a factual documentary non-fiction account by, say, DK Goodwin, would have me decisively favoring the latter, if one is going to set aside time for such an attempt. When history is at hand, it's nonfiction for me.Having said that, I had a friend in college in the 1980s who recommended this Michener opus to me around the time we were spending college spring breaks in the foothills of the Rockies in Boulder, Colorado. I found that it gave me a greater appreciation for the place, and is a very flavorful, informative history of the US West, starting all the way back to prehistoric times before settlement by the earliest Native Americans and moving forward eventually to the late 1800s with, of course, a large cast of fictional characters. After I read this, a new Michener book called Space came out, which I bought and read, and it was probably the first time I realized that a notable author could be truly awful.

Even the beaver made me cry. Michener is more than a story teller, he is a historical scientist and a geologist. He had the mountains and their formations pegged to a \"T\".

Basically I always wondered if people just had Michener books on their shelves because they were long and impressive looking, or if they were actually good and engrossing reads. I started The Source a while ago, but gave up when I got close to the present day. I found the stuff about ancient times really interesting, but the more modern it got the more it lost me. I feel I should give it another chance. Centennial was interesting all the way through, partially because even the more modern stuff was still the old west, and it's hard to make the old west boring. I think it is a little ridiculous to start the book in dinosaur times. I know he wants to be thorough, but the stuff about the animals just isn't nearly as compelling as the stuff about the people. The reader also needs to suspend his disbelief just a bit, as sometimes the characters throughout history are a little too convieniently linked to each other. But for the most part, the story really does flow along nicely, the characters are compelling, the plot twists are well played, and he does evoke the setting very well. I actually felt myself getting emotionally wrapped up in these characters, and feeling sad when they died, which doesn't always happen to a reader. It's funny the way some of this is dated. I find it crazy that a normal person from the east coast in 1973 would never have eaten a taco, or had a coors. I guess the world has changed, but man, that seems ridiculous. In fact the whole framework he puts this story in is a little silly, framing each chapter as a project for a magazine in New York. I think Michener could have come up with a better structural device than that. In fact, that's why I gave it four stars, in retrospect. But anyway, If you want a book that's evocative of the west, the plains in particular, I highly recommend this one."}, {"userName": "Suzanne", "userReviewDate": "Oct 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3739451-suzanne", "userReview": "Centennial was my Colorado pick for the Around the USA in 52 Books Challenge. And, I might add, having read it, I have completed the challenge! Yay for me!Doubly exciting was fact that Centennial was a wonderful read. As usual, Michener takes a place and goes far back into history, showing how it was formed geologically, and then how it was settled by people. I especially enjoyed his depictions of the Arapaho and Comanche and how settlement of the area affected them. There was a great deal about the treatment of Native Americans and Michener\u2019s research is excellent here.I also enjoyed hearing how cattle were brought into Colorado and the evolution of cattle ranching from Texas longhorns to Herefords and various breeding issues. I\u2019m not necessarily a huge bovine lover, but as a North Dakota native, you can\u2019t help but have an interest in cattle.And then, in the early 20th century, farming was attempted in the near desert areas. They tilled and furrowed the land, stripping it of the sod which held the dirt in place. Giant dust storms were created and thus Colorado became part of the dustbowl during the depression. I remember asking my dad about that time, and he said he remembered shoveling huge piles of dust that blew in from these storms.Also mentioned was the planting of sugar beets. I live in sugar beet country, so I had no idea that Colorado also had that in common with North Dakota. Michener\u2019s tales of trying to hire workers to help thin the beets, was a fascinating look at the evolution of immigrants and migrant workers.Overall, great story. Not quite as good as Hawaii and Alaska, but that\u2019s probably just a personal preference."}, {"userName": "Holly Lindquist", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2650600-holly-lindquist", "userReview": "A novel about Colorado and a large book in every sense of the word, Centennial is one of Michener's most successful outings. It boasts the humongous timeline we've come to expect from him, but the fiction itself rests on a solid foundation of fascinating historical facts. Exposition abounds, of course, but in this case it's well balanced against the human stories.Michener starts with a somewhat didactic geology lesson and gamely presents us with the personal trials and tribulations of dinosaurs and early mammals, followed by.. um, beavers? Well, beavers can have rich and emotional inner lives, too. Heck, you can tell the man even did massive research into beavers. This is a very dedicated writer, folks.Anyway, the human part of the book starts with the first inhabitants of the area, the Arapaho, and their initial encounter with whites. This portion has some of the most interesting characters, the Arapaho chief Lame Beaver and the intrepid French trader Pasqinel. These people are so colorful they must surely be based on real historical figures. There's a particularly disturbing massacre about a third of the way through the novel (basically the Sand Creek Massacre). Sad that so little of the horrific details of this event had to be made up by the author. (Truth is often worse than any nightmare one can dream up.)An impressive pageant of characters wander in and out the pages of this book; it'd be a slog to go through them all. You have your usual black hats and white hats, a generous amount of gray characters, and a generous sprinkling of under-developed walk on parts.

With each new generation we are able to see how our behaviors have effected the land and people around us, from dinosaurs to American Indians to cattleman and farmers.
