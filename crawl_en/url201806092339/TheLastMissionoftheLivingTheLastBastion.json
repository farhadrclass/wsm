This installment switches points of view from Maria Martinez to her best friend Lindsay Rooney and is fortunately no less intense than we\u2019ve all come to expect from any Rhiannon Frater tale. The Last Mission is a definitely longer tale but is no less worth the time.In The Last Bastion, the stronghold and the last group of people that have survived the undead creatures known as Inferi Scourge, a team of soldiers were chosen to be \u2018modified\u2019 in order to fight the undead with a higher percent chance of success. That group of soldiers became the last chance for the Bastion to survive but the mission failed and the city is still enduring the threat of the undead that swarm the borders. The political conspiracies and the constant double-dealing going on in the background of the Bastion are focused on more in this installment and it was an interesting switch-up. There was less zombie/Inferi Scourge action as The Last Bastion, however, this is still a solid follow-up and a fantastic expansion to this fascinating world.In addition to the political tidbits, there is still a worthy romance to swoon over. Lindsay and Torran, who is a part of the Science Warfare division, are on opposite sides of the game at play. When the two are put on a team with a mission to seek out food to bring back to the Bastion, a friendship develops which slowly transforms into something more. Torran had his own secret mission though and it involves bringing Lindsay\u2019s best friend Maria back to the Bastion for experimentation. The ongoing tension between the two was fantastically written.The Last Mission of the Living is a fabulous follow-up with exciting twists and turns that expands on Frater\u2019s created world nicely. The action is less than the first installment, however, the world-building is on point and will leave you hoping a surprise third installment is a possibility. Would work well as a 2nd installment or even as a stand-alone but of course I still highly recommend The Last Bastion.I received this book free from the Author in exchange for an honest review.

Well I'm thrilled to say that, even though it doesn't focus on the same characters, it's just as good as the first. I absolutely loved it and devoured the book in only a few days. Considering its a long book, that just shows how good it is!!This one features Marias best friend Lindsey. I loved Lindsey in The Last Bastion of the Living and am glad she got her own book. Character wise, Lindsey is an awesome heroine. Even though she has her disability, she is still kick ass. She isn't afraid to stand her own ground and get down and dirty with her crew. She is strong, really smart and an all round kick ass girl! Then we have yummy Torran MacDonald. He was constabulary but is now SWD. He is sent on a mission into the inferi scrag horde but unfortunately things go wrong and apart from him, his whole squad is destroyed. Torran ends up running for his life and gets help from Lindseys squad. Both strike up a friendship, which develops from there. Torran is so brave, strong and down right hot!! He stole a bit of my heart! Plot wise, it's not as focused on the inferi scrag as book 1 but is still just as good. Torran and Lindsey are sent on missions to retrieve food from the outside. But their mission is compromised and Lindsey and Torran end up stranded in Inferi Scrag infested areas and have to run for their life. This edition is more politically focused and character focused then book 1 but I enjoyed it non the less. The romance in this is intense and strong but I loved seeing Lindsey and Torrans friendship develop. They are such a great match together. Anyway, overall I absolutely loved this book. It's an intense, suspenseful read and one I know will stay with me. Lindsey and Torrans story wrapped up well but I hope we haven't seen the end of this world the author created. It's such a terrifying world but one that will drag you in. Rhiannon Frater has such a phenomenal mind and with every book I read by her, it just cements my love for her written word. She is fast becoming one of my favourite authors. She puts so much depth to her characters and world that it's hard to leave them. The Last Mission of the Living is one of those books that you wish you could read again for the first time. It's such a unique and thrilling story and I would highly recommend to everyone. You are taken on a terrifying journey along with the characters, that will have you on the edge of your seat the whole way through and leave you reeling. It will grab you an not let go!! An amazing series by an amazing author."}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Aug 16, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5375148-beth", "userReview": "The Last Mission of the Living is a outstandingly gritty plunge into the marvelous world created by Rhiannon Frater.I loved The Last Bastion of the Living so when I was given a chance to jump back into Fraters post apocalyptic, zombie infested world, I was 100% on board.What a ride!!!This story focuses on Lindsey, for those who read the first book she is Maria\u2019s best friend. Lindsey was injured and has a disability in her leg. Thought she was forever delegated to desk job, she's happy to be back on the field. When her team is sent to investigate the tunnels, it ends up becoming a rescue mission for Torran MacDonald. Torran was the last survivor of his team who went on an expedition outside the wall to eradicate the remaining Scrag (zombies).Torran and Lindsay end up on a mission to find food outside the Bastion. Of course their mission goes horribly wrong, leaving Lindsey and Torran fighting for their lives.This story has a little less focus on the scrag and a lot more political machinations. The twists and turns blew me away. Don't get me wrong there is plenty of zombie interaction...just a lot more inner workings and corruption in the Bastion.Let me just preface this by the fact I\u2019m not a big zombie fan. That being said, this book was the BOMB! I was ripped into this story and clung to ever page. The character depth is absolutely outstanding. Frater somehow takes these totally fiction characters and situation and made me feel like an active participant in their story.I requested The Last Bastion of the Living not be the end of this incredible world, now I am asking that The Last Mission of the Living still not be the last we see of this astounding, imaginary world. If Rhiannon Frater writes it I'm going to be there reading it. The way she masterfully creates these stories is truly inconceivable to me.Written by: Rhiannon FraterSeries: The Last BastionSequence in Series: 2Paperback: 294 pagesPublisher: CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform; 1 edition Publication Date: August 29, 2014Rating: 5 Stars FAVORITEISBN-10: 1500959359ISBN-13: 978-1500959357Genre: Science Fiction > Post-ApocalypticFind this book on: Amazon | Barnes & NobleReviewed for: http://tometender.blogspot.com"}, {"userName": "Lelia Taylor", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6089004-lelia-taylor", "userReview": "Much has changed since the Special Ops team cleared out most of the Scourge but there are still Scrags to be killed and, worse still, Abscrags, those that have been turned into thinking undead. It could be, though, that the most dangerous battle is taking place inside the Bastion where a struggle for power is taking shape.We first met Lindsey as a secondary character in The Last Bastion of the Living when the Vanguards made a deadly and mostly fruitless attempt to rebuild the wall. Best friends with Maria, Lindsey was given a desk job after being severely disabled but that desk job, and her hacking abilities, were ultimately more critical to the Special Ops team than could have been anticipated. Now, she's asked to go on a mission that could mean survival for the last humans and her friend, Torran MacDonald, will be going with her but he has a hidden agenda that she'll resist with all her being.Lindsey and Torran have a relationship that grows from friendship to something more and its evolution feels right, not created by the abnormalities of a post-apocalyptic situation. Whether they, or their feelings for each other, will survive the continuing fight against the Scourge and the traitors in their midst is questionable but their devotion to duty will survive. Won't it?A bit of fun comes near the end when we learn where the Bastion is in our current geography. The revelation was completely unexpected and a breath of fresh air to me and this small tidbit of information is one of the reasons I love Rhiannon Frater's work---her worldbuilding is so good I can see what she wants me to see but there is always something new around the corner. Is this the end of the story for Lindsey and Torran? Perhaps. Both The Last Bastion of the Living and The Last Mission of the Living are seemingly self-contained and there are no real cliffhangers but I'd love to know more about this world and its people so I hope that, someday, there will be at least one more book.Reviewed by Lelia Taylor, December 2014."}, {"userName": "Melissa Gouveia", "userReviewDate": "Aug 12, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13458601-melissa-gouveia", "userReview": "Loved it!!"}, {"userName": "Jennifer  (BTH Reviews)", "userReviewDate": "Apr 22, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19169838-jennifer-bth-reviews", "userReview": "I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. This does not affect my opinion of the book or the content of my review. Review originally appeared on Books That HookThe Last Mission of the Living is the second book in The Last Bastion series by Rhiannon Frater. It is available in both paperback and e-book, through online retailers only.This book picks up right where the previous book, The Last Bastion of the Living, stopped. However, the reader is now seeing things from a different point of view. This is Lindsey\u2019s story instead of Maria\u2019s.I understood the importance of giving the backstory of what happened in the first book, but the information is dumped all at once on the reader at the beginning of the book. I think it could have been given in chunks, worked in between action. But, it wasn\u2019t, and I thought there was an awful lot of \u2018telling\u2019 at the beginning. Instead of the reader being able to see how Lindsey feels, the reader is just told how she feels. This may have been for the sake of expediency because it seemed like the author was trying to quickly get the reader up to speed rather than letting the reader figure some of it on his or her own.One thing that I think will put some readers off from reading this book is the overlapping point-of-views. The reader has to go through the same scene or conversation he/she has already read, but from a different person\u2019s point of view. Sometimes this worked well for the story; other times it didn\u2019t and seemed too repetitive.After the initial information dump, the story swings into full action. Unfortunately, the goal of part one\u2013rescuing Torran\u2013is resolved quickly and there doesn\u2019t seem to be a goal for part two. There is nothing for Lindsey to accomplish at that point. Part two doesn\u2019t fit with the rest of the book. It is about Lindsey\u2019s love life. It\u2019s relevant, but drags down the pace of the story. It felt like the author didn\u2019t know which genre she wanted to be writing in, so jumbled them together in one book.I think what would have helped is if there had been a goal carrying over from part one that influenced the events in part two.In the first book, the author did this as well, but mostly skipped over the courting part of the relationship. That didn\u2019t really work for me either, so I can\u2019t say that there is a good solution to the problem, other than what I have already mentioned. I think having Lindsey fall in love is fine, but it should have been within a context of a setting that kept the action going and gave Lindsey a long-term goal other than just floating along for a while.Part three of the book introduces a new story goal of keeping people from finding Maria and Dwayne. At this point, I was back on board with the story. I loved the rest of the book. There was lots of action, great character development, and some surprises.Part four wrapped everything up well. I just thought the ending was a little implausible. If more information had been given about how it had been accomplished by Lindsey, I probably wouldn\u2019t be saying that. I don\u2019t want to give too much away, so I won\u2019t say more about this.Overall, I enjoyed reading The Last Mission of the Living, but not as much as The Last Bastion of the Living. However, I would still recommend it because the action parts more than make up for the parts that lag. If you like romance mixed in with zombie killing, you should give the series a try."}, {"userName": "Stacey Brutger", "userReviewDate": "Mar 08, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7765468-stacey-brutger", "userReview": "DESCRIPTION:Vanguard Lindsay Rooney has faced the undead hordes of Inferi Scourge and lived to tell the tale, but she has also suffered horrible losses. Like millions of other civilians, she had hoped that The Bastion would recover after a team of modified soldiers eradicated the undead hordes of Inferi Scourge that infested their valley. Yet the city still crumbles around them, along with any chance of survival.Lindsey\u2019s growing friendship with Torran MacDonald, an officer with the Science Warfare division, is her only solace as the decline of the city continues. When food riots fill the streets, martial law is enacted, and the upper echelons of government battle for control of the city, Lindsey is conscripted by her superiors to embark on a dangerous mission into the dead world beyond The Bastion. To add even more complications, Torran and the SWD join the squad.Soon, Lindsey realizes that her mission is more than what it seems, and there are secrets that could both destroy The Bastion and take her life.REVIEW:Thanks to the sacrifice of the modified soldiers, the number of Inferi Scourge has been drastically reduced. The Bastion has two missions: gather food stores to keep from starving and find the survivors of the Inferi Scourge. Lindsey volunteers for the mission to protect her friends, but when it is discovered the survivors are now immortal, the leaders will do whatever it takes to capture them, including using her as bait. Lindsey can only trust one person to guard her back, the handsome Torran MacDonlad. Now they are both on the run from the Bastion and Inferi Scourge, where they must make the ultimate decision of who lives and dies to ensure the last Bastion remains standing.Rhiannon Frater has a way with words that immediately drew me into the story. I really enjoyed being pulled back into the world of the Bastion. The characters felt very real, but as the story progressed, their day-to-day life slowed down the pacing some. While I liked both characters, I didn\u2019t really get the feeling of a wild romance between them. Although there was a few great action scenes, there was a lot less excitement and action than what I was expecting. So while I enjoyed the story, I missed the twists and turns of the first book.Posted from my site: www.StaceyBrutger.com"}, {"userName": "Rachel Tsoumbakos", "userReviewDate": "Nov 15, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5286682-rachel-tsoumbakos", "userReview": "The Last Mission of the Living by Rhiannon Frater held a major concern for me: could this book live up to the first one in the series, The Last Bastion of the Living, or would it fail like so many second books have?Well, I am happy to announce that it certainly did live up to my very high expectations!This book is unique in that it covers a whole new set of main characters, so if you wanted to read it as a stand alone, then it would completely hold up on its own. However, it is still set in the world of the first novel and uses many of the same characters from Bastion as well. Ultimately though, this novel also ties in with the first one as the end starts to intertwine with the events that unfolded at the end of the first novel.One other thing I was a little concerned about while reading this book was how it started off feeling like this series would be a two book deal. Honestly, the first conflict (in book #1) had occurred and been sorted and the second book had also had it problem set up and was on the path to being resolved.And this made me sad. Mainly because I love the world building Frater has created and I didn\u2019t want it to be over quite so quickly.But fear not! Rhiannon has managed to add more conflict that can ultimately lead into another book. All this is done without the clunky feel of your typical second novel, where there isn\u2019t much action per se other than to set up all the pieces in place for the next book.Once again I completely fell in love with the new set of characters and even found some extra enrichment for characters that I suspected I would turn out to completely hate from the first book.While I am happy to rave about this novel as much as the first one, there was one moment where I felt the tension that should have been deliciously rich in one of the action scenes just wasn\u2019t there. I\u2019m not sure why it didn\u2019t work for me, especially since every other action scene had me on the edge of my seat.Also, I am pretty sure there is a bit of a time frame issue that occurs when the main characters are climbing up endless stairs. While it takes them (what seems like) forever to get there, the scrags manage to do it in a record amount of time.Overall, I am giving The Last Mission of the Living by Rhiannon Frater 4.5 stars out of 5!"}, {"userName": "Tnt Reviews", "userReviewDate": "Dec 24, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27025470-tnt-reviews", "userReview": "I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review.This book picked up right where book one left off but from Lindsey's point of view. It again sucked me right in. I couldn't put it down. The ruling parties of the Bastion are at it again. The SWD is attempting to sabotage the President and take over. Food supplies are running out. Something needs to be done ASAP or everyone will starve to death. The Scrags have been cleared out and farming has begun. Unfortunately someone sabotages the food supply and riots break out. I really don't understand how someone can sacrifice something as basic as food for a political agenda. Lindsey and Torran, a member of the SWD, have a friends with benefits relationship. They're trying to protect their hearts from heartbreak because they've both lost loved ones. They fall for each other anyways. They are on opposite political parties and are both keeping secrets. I love these two together. They understand each other. I hate that they're keeping secrets. I hope those secrets don't tear them apart.Lindsey and Torran are selected for a team being sent out to scavenge food from old settlements. They must travel out into the world of the Scrags to aid the survival of the Bastion. Unfortunately, the team has a hidden agenda. Torran is tasked with finding Maria and Dwayne, from book one. This sets up a conflict because Maria is Lindsey's best friend. Lindsey doesn't want to see Maria captured and put in a cage in a lab. Torran will do anything to keep Lindsey safe, even capture her best friend for a cure to the virus. I found it a tad funny that they both knew the same intel but kept it from each other. They weren't sure what the other knew. Again, I could go on for days explaining what's going on in this book. There is so much. I loved it. It kept my mind engaged throughout. I never knew what was going to happen. I didn't know who to trust. I was frustrated that Lindsey and Torran didn't share all their intel. I loved Teeny the drone that Lindsey programmed. I loved how this book ended; although I was scared for a bit when Torran had to return to the Bastion.

If you thought The Last Bastion of the Living gave you heart palpitations wait until you read this one. I binged read this last night and couldn't sleep afterwards. Every time I closed my eyes I started dreaming of Inferi Scourge running amok in the valley chasing after everyone and trying to turn them into what they are while I sat and watched perched in a cage and was unable to do anything. Weird huh?The Last Mission of the Living picks up where we left off in The Last Bastion of the Living. Maria and Dwayne have been turned into Inferi Boon and have disappeared from The Bastion. Dwayne and Maria are wanted back at The Bastion, but Vanguard Lindsey Rooney (Maria's best friend) is trying to do everything she can to prevent that from happening. Meanwhile at The Bastion nothing is going right. Food shortages have been brought up to a level 4, rolling blackouts continue, and citizen have become upset and unruly. Two teams have been brought together to try and reclaim some food storages beyond the valley. Lindsey is head of her team and her boyfriend Torran MacDonald is in charge of the other. While out on a mission to retrieve some food storages at Notre Dame, Lindsey's tiltrotor goes down in the river. Torran who was in the other jumps out to save her. After saving her and a fellow crew member they must battle to stay alive and get word back to the Bastion. They find themselves in a fight to save their lives and also learn the rest of humanity.That's all the sneak peek you are getting.
