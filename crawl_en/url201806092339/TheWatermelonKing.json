His stories are written like sophisticated fairytales; more complex and therefore more meaningful, engaging, and rewarding. The Watermelon King takes place in the same city Big Fish was, Wallace\u2019s best known work, mostly due to the phenomenal motion picture version. Ashland, Alabama is best known for its Watermelons. At least historically. Once upon a time. Before our protagonist\u2019s mother, Lucy Rider, came into town, with an open mind. Something the Southerners happen to find appalling. Why change their traditions? How dare some stranger come and open their minds to new ideas? They like the way things are. I really liked how the novel was divided into two parts; how this division was done- ingeniously interweaving the two points of view (Ashland\u2019s citizens and Thomas\u2019s). **** Spoilers **** At first, all of them find Lucy\u2019s personality magnetic. They fall in love with her, each for their own reasons. The women find her mesmerizingly different; a new friend and new fun. The men, of course, cannot turn a blind eye to her unparalleled beauty. Lucy returns their affections. She has this way of making each one of them feel as if she has chosen them as her favorite. Even the town retard finds his way into her heart. In fact, some say he most of all. When she discovers Iggy\u2019s illegitimacy, she spends hours of her day teaching him how to read. Everything is great until Lucy finds out the traditional of all traditions, the one that ensures the growth of watermelon in Ashland. Every year, at The Watermelon Festival, the oldest and most loved tradition in all of Ashland, the oldest virgin in the city is paraded in ceremony and the forced to consummate with one of three selected Queens. Finding this understandably cruel and wrong, Lucy claims that she has evidence that Iggy is not The Watermelon King; she was the one who took his virginity. Due to Iggy\u2019s ugliness and retardation, she is hardly believed, but the rules state that they must wait it out for evidence of her claims. Or evidence to the contrary. The Watermelon Festival but two weeks later, there is no festival that year. That year, the watermelons suffer. And all of a sudden, all of Ashland turns against her. Nine months later, her baby is born. She manages to have a friend, Anna, rescue her son by surreptitiously taking him out of town to her father\u2019s. Even more appalled by Lucy\u2019s actions, she is shunned. In every way, this is the end of her. The rescued baby is Thomas. Thomas Rider. His story is examined in the second part of the novel. His family, as far as he is concerned, is Anna and his grandfather. Thomas\u2019s grandfather is a pathological liar (maybe by choice), creating fictional answering for everything from mundane questions to those more serious like Thomas\u2019s beginnings and in his career as a real estate agent. He is the top selling agent around, almost entirely due to the stories he tells his clients regarding previous tenants, in order to have them believe that they would be able to, for example, channel the spirits of the deceased or be able to strike it rich from oil on the land. In this way, his grandiose stories serve as a vessel for Wallace\u2019s imagination. When Thomas is of age, with Anna\u2019s blessing, he returns to his birthplace and begins the process of finding himself, finding out who he is. After learning the story of his mother from various sources, he is told that The Watermelon Festival can begin again, now that he has returned; they always knew he would, that it was only a matter of time. As a virgin, he, of course, is to be The Watermelon King. Although he is aware he can simply leave town, something compels him to stay; to see it all out and let his destiny unfold. As is not always the case, I found the ending well orchestrated. Iggy\u2019s sacrifice, paying his debt to Lucy, was not a good thing, but inevitable in a way. Thomas finally begins to fall in love- also, fittingly, with a young Lucy named after none other than his mother. Like the princess and her prince riding into the sunset, the two of them escape the clutches of Ashland under the cover and distraction of the fire Iggy started. The End."}, {"userName": "Lily Tice", "userReviewDate": "Jul 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/13867913-lily-tice", "userReview": "DNF. I got about 40% in and just can't bring myself to finish it. I think this story had a lot of potential, has some interesting language, and I'm generally accepting of slow-burners, but this just didn't move fast enough for my taste or have gripping enough characters to sell me, even close to the halfway point of the book. I picked this book up because I'm a huge fan of Big Fish (both the book and movie), and because I loved/still love the cover design of my edition. Watermelon cults and magical realism? Yes please. I liked the premise, I just think the novel format wasn't the right home for it, in my opinion. This would be an excellent short story, with just a few (or even one) narrator in the vein of Faulkner's \"A Rose for Emily\" or Shirley Jackson's \"The Lottery\". As a short story, I think this would make a chilling literary piece that could be picked apart in a higher education lit class like the best of them. But as a whole novel? I'm personally not convinced. I'm still open to experimenting with Wallace's other work, and still love the masterpiece that is Big Fish, but for now I'll accept this book as \"not for me,\" and that's okay."}, {"userName": "MB Shakespeare", "userReviewDate": "Mar 18, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/78667658-mb-shakespeare", "userReview": "An 18 year old returns to his birthplace to learn of the mother he never knew.Fave quotes: \"There is so much for them in the world and yet they refuse to see it\u2026because they're small-minded.

Providing as much a sense of place and background as William Faulkner\u2019s Yoknapatawpha County, Ashland is a small-town suburb of Birmingham, Alabama, where folks either get out or die trying. In Wallace\u2019s third and most recent novel, The Watermelon King, readers are invited back to Ashland for a new adventure of mythological proportion.Divided into four distinct sections, The Watermelon King begins with our hero, eighteen-year-old Thomas Rider, setting out on the ultimate quest in search of the details of the life and death of his mother, Lucy, in the hopes that he will find out who she was and who he is. While not a terribly original premise, one mustn\u2019t be discouraged. Wallace is becoming a master of modern-day mythology, and while the novel is a journey of discovery, there is plenty of symbolism and diversion to maintain one\u2019s interest.Thomas\u2019 voice appears at first as an almost omniscient Greek chorus where our only real knowledge of him is as the recorder of each townsperson\u2019s story. From the local innkeeper, realtor, festival committee chair, carpenter, and pharmacist to the town widow, negro, and idiot, the majority of the town\u2019s and Lucy\u2019s past as well as Thomas\u2019 beginning is discovered, and the varied personalities are established.Part Two brings the reader reminisces of Thomas\u2019 childhood and is most like Big Fish, relying on the father/son (or in this case the grandfather/grandson) bond and on oral storytelling traditions. Some of the interactions between Thomas and his grandfather parallel imagery and symbolism in Wallace\u2019s previous novels including Thomas\u2019 grandfather\u2019s tendency to stretch the truth a bit and a story about Thomas\u2019 ability to communicate with the natural world and an extraordinary comfort level underwater. Wallace also details visits to a neighbor who traditionally gives Thomas a lucky dime as a Christmas gift, which shadows a different grandfather\u2019s lucky penny found in Wallace\u2019s second novel, Ray in Reverse. Both parallels serve as foundations in Wallace\u2019s carefully constructed town of Ashland, where lucky coins symbolize the willingness and innocence of a child\u2019s trust and faith in his loved ones, while stories of people moving easily between the human world and the natural world mirror old Greek stories where mortals are sometimes given the ability to walk among the gods.As Thomas matures he begins to tire of his grandfather\u2019s elaborate responses to every question Thomas asks about who he is and who his mother was. Thomas realizes, along with the reader, that although his grandfather has defined himself by his stories, it has also been his sole means of avoiding the bare truth. Thomas is forced to watch this tragic flaw become his grandfather\u2019s demise: \u201cBecause he was not made out of flesh and blood: he was made up mostly of stories, a high-wire act of a life balanced on the suspension of disbelief, and as he became deprived of his stories he actually seemed to shrink.\u201d Part Three thrusts the reader back into present-day Ashland, where the Watermelon Festival is getting under way. The festival, in which a virginal Watermelon King is chosen to sacrifice his virginity to ensure the fertility of the town\u2019s soil and a healthy watermelon crop, bares resemblance to Shirley Jackson\u2019s \u201cThe Lottery\u201d. Followed by a plethora of folklore, mythology, and biblical symbolism, the reader is lead down the path towards surprising, albeit somewhat open-ended, conclusions. Wallace\u2019s use of biblical symbolism as we watch Thomas, the prodigal son, turn into a savior - complete with a last supper - and symbolic crucifixion contrasts with the heavily weighted symbolic comparisons of Lucy as a Greek goddess or an otherworldly siren whose Electra complex causes a swift fall and return the harsh realities of mortality.Wallace\u2019s multi-layered story unfolds as slowly and seamlessly as the petals of a flower and is immensely pleasurable to read. His foundation for Ashland is solidified in The Watermelon King, and fans of his work are surely looking forward to the next development in a world that is both recognizable and yet fantastic."}, {"userName": "Maria", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2190427-maria", "userReview": "I'm not really sure where to start with this book. I did like it, overall, but it had some elements I didn't really care for. For one, there was that magical factor like what you always see in \"folksy\" movies, but I didn't feel like it really worked for this book. Maybe it was the lack of sparkles and harp music playing in the background, but I just couldn't really suspend my disbelief and get into it like I can in a movie. It's hard to swallow magic in a story that occurs in an otherwise realistic setting. At least give me some princesses and dragons.Then, there was the pace of Part 1. The idea of introducing the back story through various interviews was good, but the execution of it felt absolutely interminable. It was obvious from the first few pages what Part 1 was getting at between Lucy and Iggy, what everyone was going to say had happened between them, but everyone just kept dancing around and around it. Get to the point, already! I feel like if a storyteller wants to take their time getting through a story, then their foreshadowing should be subtle. This was like taking an anvil to the head and then having to wait in the ER for eight hours only for the doctor to come in and say, \"Well, it looks like you sustained blunt head trauma,\" and send you on your way.Part 2 was where I started to enjoy the story more. I found the majority of the characters totally unlikeable and was completely put off by the culture of the town, but the story picked up the pace and I was able to enjoy the writing style a lot more now that it didn't seem to be beating a dead horse. From here, there was one more skull-crushingly obvious episode of foreshadowing (namely, who would be the Queen), but the author made up for that with a plot twist that actually did come out of nowhere and shake up the earlier story. I absolutely did not see this anvil coming at me.I don't want to give away whether or not the town achieved its goal in the end, but I'll say that I'd hoped the revived festival would be a failure, simply because I didn't feel that the town deserved any better. The way they excessively scorned and mocked men for being virgins and women for being promiscuous, the way they behaved towards Iggy both before and after the Lucy business, the racism and gratuitous use of the \"N\" word (which in my opinion can't even be \"excused\" by the time period, since it was set in the 1980s, though it was backwoods Alabama, if that's worth anything, I guess), the horrible plotting as far as Lucy's baby... I wanted them to fail because their culture and attitude were awful. The part with the car, just before the ending note from Iggy, seemed like maybe the author was off his game a bit. Maybe it was just because the excitement was pretty much over, and I'd reached the part you find in most \"folksy\" stories where the author has to wrap things up in a nice pretty package and satisfy the folksy readers who want a happy ending. In a way, it was sort of nice that the book didn't leave me hanging, but at the same time, I feel like it could have gone from the previous chapter straight to Iggy's note, and any reader could've concluded what would happen afterwards. The business with the car making noises and what the noise could mean just didn't feel like it was taking me anywhere. If the noisiness of the car had anything to do with advancing the plot, then it was too subtle for me to pick it out of there. But I'll admit; once I feel like the story is concluded, if the book continues to go past that point, I tend to go into skim mode.I suppose there were actually more elements here that I disliked than elements I liked, but with some authors, I can find myself enjoying a book even while I hate nearly everything about it. This seems to be a recurring feeling among many books I've read lately.

Daniel Wallace\u2019s The Watermelon King revisits the fictional town of Ashland, Alabama, the setting for his novel Big Fish and seriously the most magical realism-charged town since M\u00e1rquez's Macondo. If you\u2019ve never read One Hundred Years of Solitude, shame on you. I hope ants carry you away and devour you. You probably don\u2019t get that reference which only further proves the degree to which you suck. The novel unfolds by way of folklore, tall-tale, and myth; accounts told by a smattering of small town characters reliving the glory days of Ashland\u2019s legendary Watermelon Festival. Thomas Rider returns to the town of his birthplace searching for answers about his origins, and specifically, information on his mother, Lucy Rider. Through interviews with a number of the town\u2019s colorful characters, he learns the truth about his mother and her hand in the demise of Ashland, a once thriving and prosperous town, now dusty, dry, and balls-hot. Seriously, this place sounds hella-miserable.During the course of Thomas\u2019s proverbial find-yourself-quest, he uncovers something extremely....interesting\u2026 about Ashland. Apparently, their crops depend on an odd, ritualistic fertility tradition that pretty much boils down to this:1. Pick virgin guy2. Gather a gaggle of single chicks3. Select the soon-to-be exploited single chick that best fits with the soon-to-be-exploited virgin guy4. Make them have sex in a fieldSeed is sown. And so comes a new prosperous year for Ashland and its inhabitants (Pun Count: 2)So, as you can probably discern, something goes horribly amiss with Lucy Rider and whatever happened has left Ashland, Alabama in a state of, \u201coh lawds, we used up all our virgins.\u201d Verdict?There were a few turns of story that I wasn\u2019t too sure of, one in particular that definitely threw me for a loop. I'm personally not so fond of this plot twist; it's really the only aspect of the novel that keeps me from loving it. Regardless, I promise it will be shocking at the very least. I'm pretty sure when I read it I said out loud, \"bitch wha?\"So overall, I liked The Watermelon King. Wallace manages to create a world saturated in magical realism, always teetering on the edge of the real and fantastic while interweaving the two effortlessly. Every character is a story-teller, constantly playing with the improbable; forming a tale that is poignant and original but not without an element of violence coupled with fear that can\u2019t be shaken. By the way, those of you who have read Big Fish, or perhaps saw the movie; yes. The incredibly creepy swamp lady is still there, more fantastically, still alive, and just as charming as ever. Just consider yourself lucky if she doesn\u2019t smash any watermelons at your feet because apparently that means you're the new Watermelon King. Or I guess you could consider yourself lucky since you'll likely be de-virginized sometime in the immediate future.You shall get laid!

The blogger there had nothing but good things to say about Daniel Wallace's writing and storytelling ability. And with such a glowing review how could I resist?One of the actual cheesy quotes on the back of this book compared Wallace to Roald Dahl and I have to say I agree. I grew up reading Roald Dahl and loving the obvious imagination he put into his books. It's obvious Daniel Wallace has the same big imagination.The Watermelon King plays out in Ashland, Ala., the world's biggest watermelon patch. However, after the arrival of one Lucy Rider and her desire to stop the archaic practice of naming a watermelon king, the watermelons stopped growing in Ashland. See, the problem Lucy had with the town naming a watermelon king was that it was based on a legend that went something like this:The fertility of our land and the fertility of our people have always been intertwined. Fertility to us is everything. And so it has been our belief that no boy shall reach manhood with his virginity intact. If this were to happen, the land would dry up and we would have no more watermelons. So each year at the watermelon festival the oldest male virgin in town is chosen as the watermelon king. He goes out to a field where he is greeted by three females who take a handful of watermelon seeds from a bag. Whichever girl ends up with the golden seed is the one he sleeps with that night.But Lucy Rider, new to their town, will have none of that, so when the king is picked that year, she says she's had sex with him and she' pregnant with his child. Within the week all of the watermelon field in town wither up and die.The ensuing story is told by her son, who comes to the town to learn about his mother and hopefully find out who his real father is, which could be difficult considering every man in town is keen on taking credit for the deed.

I don't know if I was rushing through it, but the pacing was great at the beginning. Wallace expertly unfolded stories within stories, letting the reader come to understand Lucy Rider, the main figure of this novel. Her son has come to the small town she died in (as a result of giving birth to him), and he's trying to find out about her and about himself. Each townsperson featured tells his or her part of the story, and Wallace weaves these perspectives in and out, until going back to the beginning... the birth of the protagonist and what his upbringing was like with his grandfather and his mother's friend. His return to the town awakens so much there in Ashland, and the way he was just swept along into it began to feel so rushed. I don't know what else, but he was such a lackluster character compared to the vivacious personality that was his mother. I was looking for more from him, rather than just going along with the tide in the way he did.I suspected Lucy was pregnant before going to Ashland, and I suspected she and Iggy hadn't slept together. I was disappointed in her for sleeping with various other men in the town. I was disgusted by the incest element, and I felt it threw the whole story away. I loved the thoughts about seeds being life and death, and I wanted Ashland to find its revival, so I was disappointed that the town was burned down at the end. It was all just so bizarre... I thought it was heading somewhere different. I was greatly disappointed in Hargraves-Rider... he was a champion there at the beginning, and it seemed like his whole character twisted along the way. What can I say..

The cast of characters is both charming and unnerving. The ideas that Wallace plays with are ones that run deep \u2013 identify, family, tradition, sexuality. Despite the thematic gravity and sometimes very dark turns in the story, he handles the narrative with a light hand that keeps you, the reader, from feeling weighted down by the pain and grief that runs through the story.Despite the many fanciful turns in the events of the novel, the characters seemed very real. Wallace\u2019s characterization is subtle and stretched out over a series of brief encounters that make up the first half of the book as the protagonist, Thomas Rider, interviews citizens of Ashland, the place of his birth, about his mother.

Relationships are based sometimes on real feelings, sometimes on fantasy. The middle section of the book shows us the son's childhood, growing up with his mother's friend and his grandfather. The grandfather tells tall tales, the taller the better. However, no one but the reader recognized the one story that is true. I have to admit, I was pretty sure I had guessed this long before it came, but the way it was written was lovely, wrapped up in a fairy tale.

The way the author structured the book, first as a series of short interviews reconstructing the events that lead to Thomas' birth, then with his own story of how and why he came to return to the town where he was born and his mother died were interesting enough but I was fascinated and more than a little impatient to see what would happen when the two stories collided once he returned to Ashland. It kept me fascinated right up to the last page. All in all, a great read and I look forward to checking out more of Wallace's work."}, {"userName": "Kris - My Novelesque Life", "userReviewDate": "Aug 05, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6275022-kris---my-novelesque-life", "userReview": "3.5 STARS\"An endearing, often outrageous blend of fable, tall tale, and page-turner, The Watermelon King brings readers to Ashland, Alabama -- the fictional town immortalized in Daniel Wallace's Big Fish -- whose reputation is based on the long-ago abundance of watermelons. Thomas Rider knows almost nothing about his parents, only that his mother died the day he was born in Ashland. He travels there in search of his past, learning of the town's bizarre history.

The second and third sections are then told in a more straight-forward manner as Thomas recounts growing up with his grandfather and going to visit the town his mother died in. Each voice is unique and the characters and town are drawn with vividness. The truth of Thomas's father is forecast, and is a bit of a predictable and unsavory downer. But the book still sits at 3.5 for me because of the richness of the narrative. A quick read that is equal parts light, funny, tragic, and heartbreaking."}, {"userName": "Tung", "userReviewDate": "Jan 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/763514-tung", "userReview": "The third of Daniel Wallace\u2019s published works, and I only read it out of a sense of completion since I\u2019d read the other two Wallace works. In this book, Wallace\u2019s desire to be creative is overwhelmed by his lack of talent as a writer. The story is about a man returning to his grandfather\u2019s and mother\u2019s backwoods Southern hometown and trying to unravel the mystery of their past. The watermelon festival is a town tradition integral to the story. The plot is ridiculous, the characters unsympathetic, the prose fairly plain \u2013 just overall not a very well-written piece. I\u2019m beginning to think that Big Fish was an aberration for him."}, {"userName": "Erinn Maine", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16807741-erinn-maine", "userReview": "Big Fish is hands down my favorite movie, so I wanted to read something by the author. I thought reading Big Fish was too obvious a choice, so I went with The Watermelon King. Wallace definitely brought me back into his world quickly and I was entranced. I felt the hazy over-exposed light of Tim Burton. But the twists and turns and plot choices similar to a Lifetime movie or episode of SVU, pulled me out just as quickly. But, overall, I appreciate things where redheads are prominently featured and adored."}, {"userName": "C.E.", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/990760-c-e", "userReview": "I wanted to like this book. Really, I did. Ultimately though, I never connected to what I'm sure Wallace wanted me to see as a bunch of quirky, colorful characters and what I think is intended as some sort of magical realism/modern day fairy tale. In the end, although there are moments, I found it dull--not in the \"I can't stand to read this book\" so much as the \"I just finished this book and I'm already forgetting it existed\" sense.
