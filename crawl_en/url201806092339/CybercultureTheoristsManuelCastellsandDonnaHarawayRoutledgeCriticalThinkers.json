There are some interesting theories that Bell touches on, but he also doesn't full explain some concepts that are necessary for understanding theories, and he approaches the book as though everyone should already know something about cyberculture. However, since it is a beginners' book, that's a pretty big failing in my eyes. There's a lot of interesting information, however, and if you are willing to look up some of the terminology and such, then you'll be okay."}, {"userName": "kristen", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/64511-kristen", "userReview": "I believe I just found the Cliff's Notes series for PhD students."}, {"userName": "Can \u00d6zmen", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1868477-can-zmen", "userReview": "a very fast survey. made me want to read some castells so I guess it worked"}], "description": "Cyberculture Theorists is the ideal starting point for anyone wanting to understand how to theorise cyberculture in all its forms.
