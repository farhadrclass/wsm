That's pretty high praise, considering Bouton(author of \"Ball Four\") is a master of the genre. But Pat Jordan's brilliant memoir transcends the baseball theme, delving into deeper issues such as maturity and coming to grips with failure.Jordan was a \"can't-miss\" pitching phenom in 1959, and was given a huge signing bonus right out of high school by the Milwaukee Braves. But he never made out it of the minor leagues as his talent mysteriously faded all too quickly.Jordan let this experience germinate in his mind for about a decade before writing the book. Then, as an established writer and with bitingly honest self-perspective, he masterfully chronicles his own demise. His objectivity makes it seem at times as if he's writing about another person.With the passage of time, Jordan clearly sees the arrogant youngster he was. And he deftly pokes fun at himself. The New York Yankees had already heard of him while he was just a Little-Leaguer and invited him and his parents as guests to Yankee Stadium. Bristling that he wasn't asked to show off his pitching, the young Jordan \"sat there, glaring across the field at (Yankee star) Vic Raschi, warming up with his pathetic fastball.\"Jordan's descriptive powers are immense. Here, he illustrates one of his minor league pitching coaches: \"He wore horn-rimmed glasses and had thin lips always pressed so tightly together that a hundred tiny lines had formed like stitch marks around his mouth, which made him resemble a prissy, taciturn spinster.\"And there is so much more vividly depicted in this book: small-town America in the late-'50s, racism, young love, and, yes, baseball.But most gripping is Jordan's painful path to humility--a path that ultimately we all must take."}, {"userName": "Mike Reuther", "userReviewDate": "Apr 20, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5795391-mike-reuther", "userReview": "This is probably the best baseball book I ever read. Of course, it goes deeper than baseball. Pat Jordan is a big bonus baby in the Milwaukee Braves organization with the blazing fastball and the big future ahead of him. The problem is, Jordan can't harness that talent to make his dream of reaching the Major Leagues. He's self-centered, arrogant and distant from everyone. We see Jordan from the time he is a hotshot high school pitcher groomed by an older brother. And then, reality sets in. Jordan is suddenly away from home for the first time - in McCook, Neb., pitching for a Class D team, the lowest rung on the minor league ladder, and not doing so well. And that's pretty much the way Jordan's career goes for the next few years - lonely minor league outposts, few pitching triumphs. Jordan's descriptions of some of the small towns and ballparks of these dots on the map are part of what I like about this book. It's also fun to read about some of the future Major League stars that Jordan plays with or against. He nearly gets into a fight with Joe Torre. His roommate in McCook is Ron Hunt. Another teammate is Phil Niekro. Some readers have criticized the book because Jordan is not a very likable character. It's true he exhibits plenty of boorish behavior as his focus to become a Major Leaguer is so all consuming. He screams at his coaches, fights with teammates. He shows no interest in the clubs he plays for. It's all about him. That said, I like the honesty of the writing. Jordan doesn't paint himself as a saint. Sure, maybe I wouldn't have wanted to hang out with the guy back in the late 1950s and early 1960s when he was struggling to control his fastball and fumbling at learning to become a man. Still, there are some real heart-felt sections of this book too. Midway through his minor league struggles, Jordan finds himself in Wisconsin. He's at the point where he's lost all confidence, and the team isn't even letting him pitch. He pleads to be given a chance, and when it doesn't happen, he jumps the team. He has a fling with a young woman in McCook. She wants to get to know the self-absorbed pitching prodigy a little better. But Jordan pushes her away. Jordan does have a girlfriend back home whom he eventually marries. We learn little if nothing about her, although we see her enduring the life of a baseball wife. Jordan rails at her, moving her to tears, when she doesn't have his supper ready after a game. Even if you can't root for this young pitcher, it's a book worth reading. Let's face it. We lose more than we win in life, and this story pounds that point home."}, {"userName": "Harold Kasselman", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16965781-harold-kasselman", "userReview": "I am a bit disappointed because of how this book was hyped. It is very well written and holds nothing back. You have the feel of what it was like to play in the minors in 1960. The description of the towns, baseball accomodations, the tedium of the days, and the frustrations and tears of the rejected players is palpable in this story by Pat Jordan. It is honest, gut revealing, but this reader could not feel for the highly touted pitcher for the Braves organization.His aloofness and indifference to others is so paramount that the reader cannot find a way to root for Jordan even at his lowest point in a Florida flop house with his wife.True, Jordan bears his soul but there is barely an apology or regret. There seems to be no redemption. I would have liked an epilogue which told us how he has evolved(if in fact he did). There is little to get uplifted about in this classic book.Maybe the idea is that the road is not worth taking.Or was the smallest details and moments of victory enough to justify those 3 years in the minors? I gave it 4 stars because it is one of the earliest and grittiest accounts of its nature"}, {"userName": "Spiros", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/245237-spiros", "userReview": "Pat Jordan's haunting depiction of a bonus baby's four year bus ride to limbo, from a cocky, fireballing high school senior to a washed up never was, playing out the string in the lowest rung of the Milwaukee Braves' minor league chain. His descriptions of life in bush league towns, with their empty coffee shops, seedy bars, deserted streets and family-run cathouses, evoke Edward Hopper far more than they do BULL DURHAM. The fun of seeing intimate portraits of titans from my Baseball fan's infancy (Joe Torre, Tony Oliva, Phil Niekro, Rico Carty) in the earliest stages of their illustrious careers (and of finding out that Ron Hunt, who for years held the Major League record for being hit by pitches, called every casual, older female acquaintance \"Mom\") is leavened by the sobering realization that for every one of the 750 players on Major League rosters, there are hundreds that are struggling to reach that exalted plateau, to say along with Crash Davis: \"I was in the Show once...I was in the Show...best two weeks of my life...\""}, {"userName": "Jay", "userReviewDate": "Nov 09, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1618357-jay", "userReview": "[his friendliness, then his ability to pitch.

You get the impression that Jordan fancies himself a sort of young F. Scott Fitzgerald, if Fitzgerald were good at sports (the narrative voice in A False Spring is as reminiscent of Nick Carraway as it is anything), and the result is that the writing can be a bit overwrought--overly descriptive at times and quite often painfully self-aware to the point of discomfort. Still, I appreciate the memoir's ambitiousness, and, as a raw and incisive depiction of the hidden world underneath the glamor and eight figure contracts of the Major Leagues, it's pretty indispensable."}, {"userName": "Matt Moran", "userReviewDate": "Jun 30, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/278760-matt-moran", "userReview": "There's no redemption in this story and it is hard to feel much sympathy for Jordan. He may have sabotaged his career through indifference and immaturity, or he may have already been declining when the Braves signed him out of HS. There is no real explanation for why a teenager without an arm injury would lose a mighty fastball so quickly, and as Jordan seems to describe it, so mysteriously.From a pure baseball standpoint, color me skeptical that this guy was ever a high level talent.From a literary standpoint, Jordan is evocative and the reader really gets a sense of what playing in the minors was like in the late '50s/early '60s. To me, this book is kind of an unintentional companion piece to 'Ball Four' and I am not surprised Bouton liked it. The prose is vastly superior (if occasionally overwrought) and the story much less humorous, but Bouton and Jordan both write like detached, independent loners, guys who stand outside of the insularity of the baseball lifers."}, {"userName": "Jeremiah Graves", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5305599-jeremiah-graves", "userReview": "It started out with so much promise, but by the second chapter, I'd grown to loathe the narrator and found the entire thing to be an overly prose-y, jumbled account of this guy's failed attempts to prolong his minor league career.

My career was no aesthetically well-made movie-rising action, climax, denouement. It was a box strewn with unnumbered slides. A box of pure and frozen moments through which I have been sorting, picking up a moment here, a moment there, holding them to the light, seeing previously undefined details, numbering that moment, then putting it with all the others in some order which, I hope, will eventually produce a scenario of my career. But this process goes against my grain. I still prefer moments.\" p.169I first read Pat Jordan during his now infamous \"Jose Canseco is doomed article\", I envisioned him some sort of hard-ass. However for all the self-inflicted claims that he's short-tempered and un-interested he's one of the best sports writers I've ever read. Though this memoir details the minor leagues of the early 60's there are aspects of baseball, socially, that seem applicable today:\"Most American players treat Latins (often the first foreigners they have ever met) in such a condescending way because of their belief that deficiencies in the English language imply other intellectual shortcomings. For certain sensitive Latins this condescension is a constant irritation that leads to a moodiness which only reinforces the Americans' belief that all Latins are overgrown children.\"A lot of this book concerns lonely young men in empty towns. Quiet cups of coffee in the only diner in town. Dressed in uniform to watch games you won't play in that night. And failure, the failure of money as the one and only motivator. What do get when you mix loneliness and failure in a desolate landscape?

If nothing else,it is a great time capsule of small town, minorleague baseball in the early 1960s. Jordan wrote the book when he was about 31 years old,(published 1973) 10 or so years after he left the minorleague system. He describes himself, and most of histeammates, as the source of the stereo-type - 'dumb jock'.It is impressive that over those short years he developedthe maturity to see how silly and shortsighted are manyof the things that 18 year olds do. Baseball fans of the '60-70s will enjoy the 'name-dropping'Jordan does through his journey of many teammates. You geta glimpse at the early careers many players that went onto be pros (and many more that don't). Additionally, most ofthe coaches were veteran players from the '30s-50s, so thereis a view into old(er) school baseball too. He spends a few extra pages on Rico Carty and Joe Torreas they were stars at the time the book was published,thus more interest, and sell more books. The Torreinsights prove even more valuable, as of course he wenton to a long baseball and coaching career particularly withthe Yankees. Jordan is not quite as vindictive towards baseball asJim Bouton is in 'Ball Four', but they do share theperception that most coaches are blithering idiots. There was an extra interest for me in one story as hementions some local (for me) baseball lore, a teammate,promising young pitcher Jerry Hummitzsch, who was killedin a car accident when he was a member for the Austin(Texas) Braves. 'False Spring' is a great read. It's a story justas much about learning about life as it is about baseball."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Mar 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4182158-michael", "userReview": "I don't know why this book hit me. The dreams denied, as happens to most baseball players? The constant travel between cities, walking around without much to do; meeting new people but standing a bit apart? Maybe the character sketches, like the scout who looked like a weasel, but was actually honest. Or the abrupt biographies of people like Lois Steinecke, \"Word also got around that Lois Steinecke, our manager\u2019s daughter, had promptly fallen in love with Cullum. I remember seeing her once after I\u2019d heard that rumor and wondering just what Cullum saw in such a plain-faced girl. Of course, I never noticed her spectacular body at the time, nor was I aware of her impressive I.Q. and disposition so gentle as to draw anyone. They carried on their romance throughout his minor league career, and often Lois would appear in Boise, Eau Claire, or Davenport, just to be with Ken for a short time. Never during those years did she make the slightest demand on him. Finally, sensing he would not marry her, she left for South America one day, where she taught English to Indian Children.\"How, looking back, the writer can see in specific detail what an idiot he was.Pat Jordan and I are different people, with different flaws and careers.

False Spring is a kind of miracle of self-awareness. The much praised classic book, \"Ball Four\" by Jim Bouton is justly lauded but Bouton happens to be a charming self-righteous asshole. He probably still believes that he should have had a longer career in the majors. His book is funny, biting, observant and boorish in an exhausting way. He must be the most annoying dude in the world. . .all his books reveal these self-important blowhard character flaws. Whatever - Bouton brought a kind of tabloid \"honesty\" to sports journalism that was probably needed.

The author was a highly regarded pitching prospect for the Milwaukee Braves in the late 1950's, and this is the story of his first season away from home in the minor leagues. It is not a breezy tale. It is realistic, clear-eyed, and emotionally honest -- the author does not sugar-coat his own shortcomings. The flat, clear, hard language somehow evokes the small midwestern town where the story takes place, and there is a pervasive sense of longing and loneliness in the narrative, for is \"minor league\" not a natural metaphor for falling short? I read this years ago, and still remember descriptions of fans, players, and coaches -- though not of baseball action. The manager's eyes when he smiled at an old gal with whom he used to dally shone \"like little blue peas.\" \"Can't cut the mustard you old fart,\" she tells him. \"Not with an old piece of meat like you,\" he retorts -- then tells his young charges with a gleam in his eye what a fine lay she was back in the day.
