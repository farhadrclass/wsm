It takes place at the end of the Civil War and just afterwards. The main character is a teenager. The region is plagued by 'home guards', men whose job it is to catch deserters and young men who are avoiding military service. There were a lot of them in that part of the country because there was a lot of Union sympathizers. There are also raids by union and confederate bands that roam the countryside, which has turned essentially lawless. The other thing the home guards did was to capture runaway slaves, free blacks and Indians, of which there were many in this part of the world, and send them to work camps. Fort Fisher was built by such people.The main character falls in love with a young man who organizes a band of local youths hiding out in the swamps. They conduct raids and turn into outlaws and rebels against the confederate cause. The corrupt local sheriff tries to find them. In a climactic scene, the young man watches in hiding as the sheriff tortures and then kills his father and brother looking for information. When the war ends, the band stays hidden in the bush, and turns to robbing. Altogether this is a fine book. The only problem I had was keeping track of the characters. There were too many for the casual reader to keep track of despite the genealogical trees displayed in the front cover. It is also a little difficult to follow, especially when there is a scene with a lot of action."}, {"userName": "Shannon", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2007", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/216164-shannon", "userReview": "This is a beautifully written book. Humphreys clearly loves words and it was a pleasure to read her descriptions and her characters. While this is not a fast-moving book, it has a great sense of place and time and transports you there as the reader.As with many good characters, the narrator, Rhoda and her love, Henry, are flawed. Flawed characters are wonderful because they remind me of how flawed we all are - how we all make good choices and bad ones and pray that our bad ones don't hurt ourselves or others too deeply. While I thought the characters were well-written and thought provoking, I'm not sure I ever knew them very well. While that would often be a strike against a book, I think in this book it is a testament to the writing that we don't know the characters better - they kept their true selves hidden from each other as well.This book is set in the swamps of North Carolina, a murky, muddy area. Because this book is so well-written, the narrative felt at times a bit murky and muddy. You couldn't always see exactly where the author was going until you were there, just like the trails the characters follow through the NC terrain.If you're looking for a read that will challenge you and transport you, this is a good choice."}, {"userName": "Terri", "userReviewDate": "Feb 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8545305-terri", "userReview": "An exquisitely written story of a North Carolina backwater caught between forces of the American Civil War, told through the eyes of a Lumbee Indian girl.

Derisively dubbed Scuffletown by its \"mack\" neighbours (Scottish farmers mostly), known as \"the settlement\" to its inhabitants, the area subsists on turpentine manufacture, which has come to a halt with the war.The story is told by Rhoda Strong who recalls those days of upheaval, tragedy and love from the vantage point of her middle years. She was 16, daughter of a stalwart Scuffletown woman and an outsider, a Scot, weaned from drinking by his wife and subject to bouts of depression.As the story opens, Rhoda's mother, Cee, keeps the family inside their one-room, windowless cabin in the heat of summer to protect them, especially Rhoda's two brothers, from the Home Guard. The Home Guard is made up of \"mack\" neighbours, determined to spare their own boys by conscripting Scuffletown youth for forced labour at the Confederate forts and salt works.It's a lawless time in the backcountry and the sadistic head of the Home Guard rules with impunity. After two boys are killed escaping from the work gangs, Scuffletown's young men take to the woods, under the leadership of Henry Berry Lowrie, a charismatic, focused young man admired by the whole community, secretly loved by Rhoda. Cee is against the match, though she believes Henry \"could turn out to be the best we've got. The best we've ever seen.\" But since when does a girl ever take her mother's advice on a husband?Eventually Sherman's March brushes Scuffletown, incidentally disrupting the Home Guard's final murdering rampage. The rampage's aftermath makes Henry a permanent outlaw with a price on his head, leaving Rhoda waiting.It was a different story to what I usually read and at the end of it I wondered if it was a true story or not, it was so compelling."}, {"userName": "Tiffany", "userReviewDate": "Jan 11, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3127773-tiffany", "userReview": "I don't think I could have enjoyed this book more.

The heroine is serious but sassy Rhoda Strong, daughter of a Native American and a Scotsman, brought up dirt poor in the swampy, turpentine-producing woods area of Robeson County, North Carolina.Scuffletown is peopled with Lumbee Indians, whose origins have been obscured, but this is of much less concern to them than it is to the good doctor McCabe, who is something of an amateur anthropologist. Also in the area are Scots plantation owners, freed black slaves, and others of mixed race. Rhoda's parents recognise that their daughter has the brains and ability to be a schoolteacher, so she is exempted from helping at home and goes every day to the McCabe household for lessons. But, having learnt to read, Rhoda tires of the 'mack' (Scottish) culture, and dreams instead of love \u2013 'the kind as fierce as fire'. Well, she gets it, and a whole lot more besides.With the onset of the war, Rhoda's Indian brothers and cousins avoid conscription into the Confederate army by becoming outlaws and hiding out in the roadless, notoriously difficult terrain of the swampland. Rhoda falls for the elusive ringleader, Henry Lowrie, against her mother's advice that it will end in tragedy. While Scuffletown is not a major arena in the war, everyone's bellies are affected by the interruption of commerce and soldiers raiding the fields and stores. The area is the scene of numerous local battles, friction between the two communities, mack and Indian \u2013 or sheriff and outlaw. Henry is increasingly embroiled in this and so Rhoda becomes involved, emerging as a resourceful, resilient survivor of the hardships and slaughter.Nowhere Else on Earth is meticulously researched, and many of the characters, including Rhoda and Henry, are based on real people. Josephine Humphreys has a knack for the Carolina vernacular, and makes her characters come alive with filmic vividness. She starts out slow, setting the scene expertly with descriptions of life in the backwoods, and builds the story gradually until it grips the reader with a series of intense crises. The straightforward prose underlines the impact of the traumatic events, which were described so poignantly I was close to tears.The scope of this saga is broad, encapsulating the effects of colonisation, racism, class, poverty, and the different effects of war on women and men, without once lecturing. But is is also a love story, written with warmth, compassion and a penetrating eye on the human condition."}, {"userName": "Michael", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4865358-michael", "userReview": "I did not realize until I had already finished the book and read the Author's Note at the back that this novel is based on a true story! Henry Berry Lowrie, the novel's central male character and center of interest, actually lived and did the things described in Ms. Humphreys' book, living as a member of an outlaw gang out of the forests of Robeson County, a kind of Robin Hood to his own people. Nowhere Else on Earth, told from the perspective of Rhoda Strong, his eventual bride, follows the fortunes (mostly misfortunes) of Scuffletown, an unofficial settlement of Lumbee Indians in North Carolina during the Civil War. As the characters eventually discover, they are probably descendants of a local Indian tribe and the missing English settlers of Roanoke colony whom they took in. Not much is made of this revelation in the story, though there's a feeling that that is proper. Nothing in the lives of the Scuffletowners \u2014 their poverty, their Indian origins, etc. \u2014 is sensationalized or romanticized. In fact, if I had one main criticism, it would be that there is hardly any romance in the book, save in the modern sense. I felt that the first half could have been dramatically shortened, as the main incidents of the plot do not occur until later on, and when they do come, they pass by too quickly. I think the problem is that the author wanted to write a nonfiction treatment of this intriguing area and its history, in the form of a novel. I did not get the feeling of the lushness and richness of history which I usually get in historical novels that I love. And much was made of Rhoda's family's experience early on, only for most of these characters to disappear into the background once she marries Henry. Don't get me wrong, the characters (especially Henry) and their situations and their choices and actions were all very interesting. I just felt that there was a certain something missing. I'd recommend it for lovers of Southern fiction, and for enthusiasts of the Civil War, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it for general reading \u2014 though I am glad I read it, and do think it worth the time."}, {"userName": "Kellie", "userReviewDate": "Apr 27, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/842772-kellie", "userReview": "I did not finish this book.

Characters are dropped into the story and you have no idea who they are or the role they play. I found myself re-reading pages thinking I missed something but I didn\u2019t. It wasn\u2019t there to begin with. The story was choppy. No flow. Not to mention, I was never sure what the actual story was about. I know the story is about Rhoda, a young girl with Native American blood who lives with her family in the south during the Civil War. She spends a lot of time with her family in a house with no windows in the middle of the hot summer. Local boys are being taken for hard labor and some are never seen again. A character named Harris kills two black boys in cold blood and nothing is done about it.

It's about people I didn't know existed. A tribe I suppose. People who lived along a river called The Lumbee, in North Carolina near Lumberton. Poor folks, of Indian and mixed race stock. The voice of the woman narrator is believable and full of a kind of back-woods regional pridethat I feel like I understand, in spite of having been brought up within a few hours of Manhattan. Having worked for years on an oral history of a town that is a three hundred year old European settlement, in NY State, I've often felt a sadness at the lost history of the Indian blood that blended in with those mostly English settlers.

The story centers on a place in Robeson County called Shuffletown that housed a mixture of Native Americans and their families.

The story recounts the terrors and hardships of the war, and shows that the Robeson County inhabitants had to fight off both the Yankees and the Rebels.

The Lumbee settlers are a strong-willed bunch, and for the most part they find a way to get through it all.In something of an aside, it's asserted in this book that the Lumbee Indians are actually descended from the lost Roanoke Colony.
