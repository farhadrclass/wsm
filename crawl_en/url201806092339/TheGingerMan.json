That was probably a wise intuition as I'm quite certain that Sebastian Dangerfield, the ginger man of the title, would have driven my younger self to some extreme act such as burying the book in a deep hole after the first twenty pages. But if I had done that, I\u2019d have thrown away a collection of curious artefacts. Donleavy's book is like the archeological site of literary Dublin and this review is an attempt at an excavation of that site. You won\u2019t discover much about the plot or the characters here, just a comment on each find I unearthed, at least the ones I was able to identify. So, this way the museyroom, folks, and don\u2019t forget to clean your boots goan out!*Although the terrain of The Ginger Man is strewn with appropriations from other works, their titles are never mentioned so the reader has quite a bit of digging to do to assemble them in a recognisable form. Fortunately, this reader has been getting lots of practice at that activity while tagging similar unattributed artefacts in Joyce\u2019s Finnegans Wake so scraping through the clay of Donleavy's book was easier and more rewarding than it might otherwise have been. The practice of not citing his references is but one of the parallels with Joyce\u2019s work; fragments from all of Joyce\u2019s writing are generously strewn about Donleavy\u2019s worksite. Sebastian Dangerfield not only shares Stephen Daedalus\u2019 initials but he also shares the surname Dangerfield plus some other unsavory attributes with the scurrilous villain of Sheridan Le Fanu\u2019s The House by the Churchyard, a nineteenth century tale set in the Chapleizod area of Dublin and which Joyce built into the foundations of Finnegans Wake, also set in Chapleizod. However, the Hill of Howth in the north of the city, is even more central to the historical themes in Finnegans Wake. And where does Donleavy begin his tale? On the Hill of Howth, a great place for the history, as Dangerfield bluntly puts it. He also meditates on the 'coincidence of contraries', a pet theory of sixteenth century philosopher, Giordano Bruno, which along with his writings on metempsychosis, greatly influenced Joyce in both Ulysses and Finnegans Wake. The Ginger Man opens with talk of tubs, and it\u2019s difficult not to be reminded of Jonathan Swift\u2019s A Tale of a Tub which Joyce refers to frequently in Finnegans Wake. The Ginger Man ends with Dangerfield eating a mutton kidney exactly as Leopold Bloom is doing on the 16th of June, 1904, when we first meet him in Ulysses. In between there are many other allusions to literary Ireland, almost as if the Irish Tourist Board had commissioned the book as an advertising gimmick. Or perhaps not; the narrative is set in the late 1940s, a time when Dublin was home to an entire pubfull of literary men, more than one of whom had drinking talents to rival the Ginger Man, men such as Flann O'Brien, Brendan Behan, Patrick Kavanagh and Anthony Cronin. The group used to meet in a pub called McDaid's in the city centre and when they were particularly short of funds, some of them lived in an infamous basement called The Catacombs where they continued their drinking and carousing. Both McDaid's and The Catacombs feature in The Ginger Man along with practically every other pub in the Dublin of the period. Guinness and Gold Label whiskey have starring roles too: When I die I want to decompose in a barrel of porter, Dangerfield intones from the bottom of his whiskey glass. Certain sections of this book reminded me very much of Anthony Cronin's memoir, Dead As Doornails: A Chronicle Of Life, written much later than Dunleavy's book: There were some Americans, ex-service men who had come to Ireland originally to be Trinity students under the G.I. Bill and remained on when its bounty was exhausted, among them J. P. Donleavy, then supposed to be a painter but meditating a big book about Ireland to be called, I seem to remember, \u2018Under The Stone'; and Gainor Crist, who was to provide the original for that book, subsequently called The Ginger Man (a curiously transformed and lessened portrait)... Most of this company assembled in McDaid\u2019s every day...and almost every night the entire assemblage moved on to the Catacombs. These and what went on there have been described so often now, in works of apparent fiction like The Ginger Man, or alleged fact such as Ulick O'Connor\u2019s Biography of Brendan Behan. The whole place smelt of damp, decaying plaster and brickwork, that smell of money gone which was once so prevalent in Ireland. Off the corridor leading out of the kitchen were various dark little rooms. Mine had, I think once been a wine-cellar. There was hardly space for a bed in it, and none for anything else except a few bottles and books.Sebastian Dangerfield is a student in Trinity College when we first meet him, busily drinking up his G.I. money; he describes The Catacombs in similar terms to Cronin\u2019s: A smell of damp walls and cavities. A feeling of long corridors and hidden rooms, tunnels in the earth, black pits and wine cellars filled with mouldy mattresses. In these corridors he meets a character called Barney Berry, a thinly disguised but hilarious double for Brendan Behan. Other characters may be based on real life people too, perhaps even Cronin himself, but if so the portraits are better disguised. I wondered if Dangerfield\u2019s sidekick Kenneth O\u2019Keefe, another Irish American G.I., was a portrait of the Dunleavy himself. O'Keefe exits the novel at one point to go and achieve his ambition of being a 'writer' in Paris; Dunleavy wrote The Ginger Man partly in Paris.Among the other curious items found while excavating the site of The Ginger Man were some odd narrative strategies. Who is the narrator, we wonder in the early pages, and then it slowly dawns on us that the narrator is in fact the main character: Dangerfield sometimes speaks in the first person and sometimes in the third so that the reader gets nicely confused. The strategy is a little like the spider walk described on page 209 : I've been trying to perfect it for some time. You see, every two steps you bring the right foot across from behind and skip. Enables one to turn around without stopping and go in the opposite direction.Songs and rhymes are threaded through the narrative as in Finnegans Wake, and Donleavy often concludes a chapter with a haiku-type verse, sometimes shaped like its subject:In AlgeriaThere is a townCalled TitThere are lots of religious references and an odd preoccupation with the days of the week: Come down God and settle on my heart on this triangular FridayAnd: I\u2019ve known Mondays come on a FridayMuch of the narrative is written in a kind of telegraphic style almost like stage directions but there are more eloquent lines too:  Where is the sea high and the wind soft and moist and warm?Or: clusters of men hunched in black overcoats sucking cigarettes, spitting and mean. With tongues of shoes hanging out like dogs' hungry mouths.And this:  Wednesday, a grey dreariness general over the city, reminding us of the last lines of Joyce\u2019s The Dead, snow was general all over Ireland..If it sounds like I\u2019m complaining about such appropriation, I\u2019m not. When you\u2019ve read a book without echoes, a book of bare space and rough hewn furniture as I did recently, finding one which is full of rich furnishings from its author\u2019s reading life, is very welcome. Any writer who sets his novel in Dublin city must find it exceedingly difficult to avoid the shadow of the great authors who\u2019ve gone before. Perhaps Donleavy is simply offering homage, not only to Joyce and the others he alludes to, but to the very practice of appropriation.* Finnegans Wake, page 10"}, {"userName": "Jonathan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3802964-jonathan", "userReview": "I'd hazard a guess that this is one of Shane McGowan's favourite books. Personally, I found the wife-punching, baby-smothering, lying, stealing gobshite of the title utterly charmless. Reading the reviews, however, he's apparently a delightful comic rapscallion. Perhaps this sort of thing was daring and bawdy back in the uptight 1950s. If, like me, Dangerfield's sozzled transatlantic blarney leaves you cold, you are left with the world's most unconvincing sex-machine (with the possible exception of Reg Varney in On The Buses). Sure, Dangerfield wins all his fights, outwits all his pursuers and beds all the women, but only because of Donleavy's benevolence. Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but we're away with the fairies as far as plausibility goes here. And the book simply reeks of misogyny. There are only so many times women (who, it seems, are only good for one thing) can be hit, verbally abused or get covered in excrement before your eyes start to roll uncontrollably in your head."}, {"userName": "Lynne King", "userReviewDate": "May 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15736557-lynne-king", "userReview": "Review \u2013 The Ginger Man \u2013 28 May 2013\u201cWhen you get back Kenneth, I\u2019ll walk naked wearing a green bowler to greet you at the boat. With a donkey cart flying green streamers and green shamrocks imported from Czechoslovakia and a band of girl pipers blowing like mad. Did you know that they imported the English sparrow into America to eat horseshit off the streets?\u201dWho else, but an Irish writer, and a zany one at that, could possibly have written that?It\u2019s interesting to know, however, that when \u201cThe Ginger Man\u201d was published in Paris in 1955, it was simultaneously banned in Ireland. It was considered obscene at the time and it typically took the all-embracing French to appreciate it for its sensual and literary worth.Yes, I did find it slightly risqu\u00e9 when I first read it but then that was twenty or so years ago and so returning to \u201cThe Ginger Man\u201d after this gap, has been a shock, to put it mildly, to my system. I recall that previously I sailed through it, appreciating it for the Irish dry sense of humor, the nonchalant air of the poverty-stricken protagonist, Sebastian Dangerfield, and the atmosphere of Dublin in the late forties. I was so impressed by it in fact that I immediately purchased another five of his books:\u201cThe Onion Eaters\u201d\u201cA Singular Man\u201d\u201cMeet My Maker the Mad Molecule\u201d\u201cThe Saddest Summer of Samuel S\u201d\u201cThe Beastly Beatitudes of Balthazar B\u201dThey were all pretty comical and wacky, especially \u201cThe Onion Eaters\u201d but basically the best one was \u201cThe Ginger Man\u201d. Why is it, I ask myself, that so many authors write a magnificent first novel and then the following ones never seem to live up to the initial expectations?But now, reading this book, I\u2019m viewing it completely differently; if anything it\u2019s more the style as opposed to the plot which really cannot be called too exciting and which regrettably doesn\u2019t enthrall me to turn the page, and read and read, without putting it down until the end. It has a writing style, however, that is quite unique, and I would imagine very difficult to do, that of swinging from the first to the third person and back via the main character, Sebastian Dangerfield. That is either very clever or extremely foolish but it suits the style of this book.An example is:\u201cO\u2019Keefe sauntered sadly off and disappeared down this gray dark street called Seville Place. Dangerfield walked back across Butt Bridge, a finely divided rain falling. My body has blue joints. Ireland is heaven bound with this low weather...And clusters of men hunched in black overcoats sucking cigarettes, spitting and mean. With tongues of shoes hanging out like dogs\u2019 hungry mouths. I\u2019d give anything for a drink now.\u201dWho but J. P. Donleavy could have started his book with the first three mini paragraphs:\u201cToday a rare sun of spring. And horse carts clanging to the quays down Tara Street and the shoeless white faced kids screaming.O\u2019Keefe comes in and climbs up on a stool. Wags his knapsack around on his back and looks at Sebastian Dangerfield.Those tubs are huge over there. First bath for two months (note from me: let me stay a mile from him \u2013 I imagine that he would be \u201cwell cooked\u201d). I\u2019m getting more like the Irish every day. Like going on the subway in the States, you go through a turnstile.\u201dStrange turns of phrase run throughout the book but what a helter-skelter of a ride has this turned out to be. One moment I think that Sebastian is a ghastly fellow. He appears to be such an unsavory, unclean, unreliable, Irish-American, who really doesn\u2019t seem to know which country he belongs to \u2013 Ireland or America; who is constantly on the lookout for sexual pursuits and imbibing copious amounts of alcohol. Worst of all, he\u2019s a liar to all intents and purposes. Then a few paragraphs or chapters later on, he becomes funny, gentle, endearing, picaresque, full of the blarney and a pleasure to read. There\u2019s a certain mockery about him too and yet also a poignant side.I feel for his long suffering wife Marian, who tries so hard to make a go of this marriage but our dear Sebastian had no idea how to behave with her and even fantasizes and thinks of another woman, Ginny Cupper, when he\u2019s making love to her. Ah yes, she \u201ctook me in her car out to the spread field of Indiana\u201d.I actually think I would have tossed him out with a flea in his ear!To help their financial problems, Miss Lilly Frost comes to live with them. Marion finally, however, gives up on her husband\u2019s feckless behavior and takes the child Felicity back to Scotland. Does Dangerfield appear to miss her? Not really, just the convenience of having her around, like a well-heeled shoe.His attitude towards money counts for naught. What decent man who has been left money by his wife to pay the bills, would spend it and in addition hock their fire. His well-spoken American friend, Kenneth O\u2019Keefe, with delusions of grandeur, also deserves a boot up the backside. Such a clever, amusing, unclean, complex individual and also thoroughly unlikeable but then he also turns up trumps in that he\u2019s so amusing from time to time. What a contradictory book this is turning out to be. He constantly admonishes Sebastian about his bad drinking habits:\u201cThis, Dangerfield, is your blood for which your family will starve and which will finally send you all to the poor house. Should have played it cozy and married strictly for cash. Come in drunk, have a quick one and whoops, another mouth to feed\u2026\u201dOther girls/women such as Chris, Mary and Miss Frost all love him to death, feed him, not only by giving him their food or money but also physically. He\u2019s a taker and the remarkable thing is that he gets away with it; his stealth in his creepy, sly way of getting into Miss Frost\u2019s bed and the guilt after the event. Her wish to confess to the priest because this sexual act was a mortal sin.And yet the hypocrisy:\u201cLilly, why did you want me to do it this way?\u201d\u201cO Mr Dangerfield, it\u2019s so much less of a sin.\u201d\u201cAnd fun too.\u201dStill Sebastian always manages to extricate himself from his involved, convoluted relationships with women and yet he goes off to London with Mary and \u2026.well that\u2019s for you to find out.And finally, on being viewed by other people:\u201cOn O\u2019Keefe\u2019s head a brown dirty tweed cap. Women in this lounge looking at the two of them with their legs stretched all over the place. And they were cocking their white ears to hear that bearded man go on about such fantastic things with that awful accent of his and who is that man with his haughty ways and county voice, flicking his fingers exquisitely and rolling back his head to belch laughter. So sure of themselves.\u201dIn conclusion, am I pleased that I reread this book? Well, yes and no. There\u2019s a strange kind of brilliance to it that I didn\u2019t feel the first time around but the criticism I do have, of myself anyway, is my ambivalent feeling here. This was definitely the best of all his books but nevertheless I think my reading style is now going in a different direction. I\u2019m more into a good plot, sensitivity in the writing style, one that flows but with a touch of exotic spices and flavors thrown in, combined with musical elements that enthrall me; a book to entice and whet the appetite; to try and venture out and experience all; laughs and thrills too I guess. But the most important aspect is that of unexpected anticipation\u2026 That says it all. Whatever one says about this book, it certainly remains in the mind and I\u2019m intrigued to know for how long."}, {"userName": "Darwin8u", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2294090-darwin8u", "userReview": "\"The lyrical quality of money is strange.\"- J.P. Donleavy, The Ginger Man (It is like J.P. Donleavy lifted Harold Skimpole out of Hard Times and made a whole whore of a novel of him as a young law student in Dublin. There are novels about drinking and there are novels about being shitfaced. This is a shitfaced novel. It ranks right up there with Lowry's Under the Volcano. Except insead of meszcal, there is plenty of stout and Irish whiskey. The prose is distilled three times: once with food, once with f#cKing, and once with irreverant flippancy (maybe once too for finances, but that would ruin my trinity of distilation image). But the prose? Dear God, Mary and the baby Modern Library, J.P. Donleavy can write crazy post-Joyce juice. He was rock and roll before rock and roll. His sentences hit you like Mick Jagger dancing on John Bonham third drum stick. It doesn't seem like a long novel, but requires slow, devoted reading.

For all those 1 and 2 star reviewers on here who \"hated\" the book for its \"misogyny\" and the \"unpleasantness\" of Sebastian, I quote the following: \"He sat there elbows on his thighs hands hanging from his wrists.Dreaming out this sunset. Tacked up on a cross and looking down. A cradle of passive, mystifying sorrow. Flooded in tears. Never be too wise to cry. Or not take these things. Take them. Keep them safely.

Her lashes dark and flickering, the wandering skin around her eyes. Some lines of her hair and her age of thirty four. The vulnerable steep bottom of her skull. Never to turn around and look at our backs, or as we are walking away. But her feet stepping with red toes. The part of her that was her falling arches, the sway bent ankles which put a tender part in her eyes. For women are lonely people, lonelier with women and with men, enclosed by sunless children and the little vanishing things that go away during the years of waiting. And hearts.

I don't know why so many people seem to be so appalled by the protagonist Sebastian Dangerfield. Sure, I don't personally agree with many of Dangerfield's actions (his often offensive behavior seems to be the sole reason as to why some people slam The Ginger Man). I don't read literature to find examples of characters who never commit a sin, however. I read selective fiction, for the most part, to be engaged in an entertaining tale. Donleavy more than delivered my craving for a raucous and thought-provoking fictional ride. This literary feat was accomplished all through the lens of a character who may not be the most stand-up guy, but one who I surprisingly found myself rooting for in the end.After reading many of the other reviews, a lot of readers compare The Ginger Man to The Tropic of Cancer. I have also read the latter and while I do see some comparisons between the protagonists here, I absolutely detested Miller's work. I didn't dislike Tropic of Cancer because of the offensive material, but rather because I thought it was base just for the sake of being base. I also just thought it was an unenjoyable read. As for the comaprison of the two, I don't think Donleavy was chasing the shock appeal that Miller may have sought. I found The Ginger Man to be quite a well-written and engaging story. My only criticism would be that around the last third of the book or so, the stream-of-consciousness scenarios became a little difficult to follow and not as tight as the earlier anecdotes."}, {"userName": "Wanda", "userReviewDate": "Nov 21, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9246169-wanda", "userReview": "Before starting this novel, it would be helpful to review two definitions:1. Satire: the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.2. Picaresque: of or relating to an episodic style of fiction dealing with the adventures of a rough and dishonest but appealing hero.I started reading The Ginger Man without reviewing those principles and nearly quit in disgust. Even after getting those concepts clear in my head, I was able to merely tolerate the main character. Sebastian Dangerfield is truly a bastard, totally consumed with drinking, smoking, eating, and seducing women, all while doing absolutely no work (or study) and paying as few bills as possible. In other words, I had great difficulty with seeing him as an appealing main character.You\u2019ve probably run into one of these characters at some point in your life\u2014if he would just put as much effort into a job as he puts into avoiding getting a job, he would have the money that he so desperately desires. Those of us who live responsible lives watch these cads with fascination and revulsion\u2014most of us wouldn\u2019t be able to withstand the mental strain that they navigate on a daily basis, leading me to believe that they are either narcissists or sociopaths, who simply don\u2019t feel the responsibilities of civilized life in the way that most of us do. [Wikipedia informs me that this book is reputedly semi-autobiographical for Donleavy, making me wonder what kind of person he is].I\u2019ve also read a later book of Donleavy\u2019s, The Beastly Beatitudes of Balthazar B, which is somewhat different in tone. Balthazar is a somewhat more sympathetic character, portrayed as a confused victim in life, manipulated by those around him (somewhat like O\u2019Keefe in The Ginger Man). But Balthazar\u2019s friend Beefy is another version of Dangerfield. I\u2019m also curious about the title, The Ginger Man. It is never explained and Dangerfield doesn\u2019t refer to himself as the ginger man until page 255 and not again until the very last page. If the cover is any indication, it refers to Dangerfield\u2019s hair colour, as he is illustrated as a red head. So that remains a bit of a question in my mind.Part of my issue, I am sure, is that I am female and tend to identify with the women in the novel. I was frustrated with their behaviour as well. Why in the world would his wife leave Sebastian a forwarding address the first time she left him? And those single women whom Sebastian seduces\u2014what in the world do they see in him? I want to shake each and every one of them!One of my female friends recommended Donleavy\u2019s writing to me and I chose this book because it was on the Modern Library\u2019s list of 100 top novels. Obviously other people find it amusing and worthwhile to read. I cannot count myself among them, however, despite the skillfulness of the writing. I think this is the last Donleavy work that I will read. There are too many books that I\u2019m sure I will enjoy to spend my valuable reading time on this author."}, {"userName": "Ian \"Marvin\" Graystik", "userReviewDate": "Feb 11, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5022264-ian-marvin-graystik", "userReview": "REVIEW:Chaucer\"O scathful harm, condition of poverte!With thirst, with cold, with hunger so confounded,To asken helpe thee shameth in thin herte,If thou non ask, so sore art thou ywoundedThat veray nede unwrappeth al thy wound hid.\"Down and Out in Paris and DublinManning Clark talked about sex, religion and alcohol as the three great comforters. In \u201cThe Ginger Man\u201d, JP Donleavy seems determined to prove that you can get by with at least two: sex and alcohol, if you add the occasional brawl, fist fight, punch or slap with your rivals, your peers, your mates or your wife, partner or mistress.Manning Clark\u2019s reference to comfort begs the question: for what are we receiving comfort? It doesn\u2019t seem that parenthood, marriage or relationships are particularly stressful, at least for the \u201cginger man\u201d, Sebastian Dangerfield. His greatest source of stress is his desperate poverty, which he seems to share with most of his Irish friends, even though he is a law student at Trinity College, Dublin (a Protestant from the USA), and most of them are poorly paid manual workers (Catholics or micks). With poverty comes the need to rent a home, and the inability to pay the landlord, so Dangerfield is continually hounded by his landlord, the dreaded Egbert Skully, who doubles as his own debt collector and haunts him like a troll.Lilly, Rose, Mary and the Jack of HeartsIf Dangerfield has one more source of comfort, it\u2019s his way with words.

Dangerfield gets the best lines, while Donleavy habitually switches from third person to first person narrative, as smoothly and imperceptibly as a pint of Guinness going down after a hard day's work. Donleavy often writes in short, abbreviated, staccato sentences, which create an urgency of motion or emotion, especially when the protagonists are embedded. He also resorts to modest alliteration, which delights as much as finding a sixpence in your pudding at the pub.\"Today a rare sun of spring.

Obviously if one is going to spend hundreds of pages in \u2013 or around \u2013 a character\u2019s head, then it is preferable to empathise with him or her. However there are some books, Dostoyevsky\u2019s \u2018Notes From Underground\u2019 say, where clearly we are not supposed to like the central character and yet the passion of the prose is such that we can\u2019t help but admire the work anyway.These thoughts were high in my mind as I read \u2018The Ginger Man\u2019. Sebastian Balfe Dangerfield is an American with an English accent who drinks, carouses and swindles his way through Dublin and London. His behaviour is mostly atrociously selfish and sometimes seems to spring from a deep-set maliciousness, and yet (sort of Spoiler Alert!) he faces no great comeuppance at the end and one gets the impression that if his story was picked up a year later it would be much the same. He staggers, shagging and arguing, from one grim situation to the next, leaving a trail of gullible women injured in his wake. And are we supposed to like him for this? Are we supposed to be amused by his exploits and smile at what an uncontrollable rogue he is? Or, if we are occasionally amused by the set-pieces which arise from his actions, do we chuckle with a little shudder? Do we congratulate ourselves on (hopefully) never having run into such a person?To be fair it is brilliantly written and there are some laugh out loud moments within these pages. But whereas a book like \u2018Notes From Underground\u2019 is a character study where the reader is supposed to dislike the character, I think \u2018The Ginger Man\u2019 wants the reader to be on Dangerfield\u2019s side. And if you\u2019re not in Dangerfield\u2019s side then it is like looking through a window at some dreadfully reprehensible party and being immensely glad that you\u2019re not part of it."}, {"userName": "James Newman", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5138768-james-newman", "userReview": "I became aware of this book after recently reading a Hunter S. Thompson biography, wherein it describes how Hunter discovered the book in New York, and did his best to imitate Dangerfield's lifestyle. After reading the Ginger Man it became apparent that Hunter had at last found a hard act to follow in terms of womanising, alcohol abuse and empty promises. Apparently the Ginger Man was turned down by something like 40 publishers before finding it's way to the mainly pornographic publishers Olympia Press in Paris. Despite turning out mostly smut, Olympia owner Maurice Girodias also published some early works by the likes of Samuel Beckett, William Burroughs, Henry Miller and Jean Genet amongst other rising literary talents of the time. I mention the publication as it's interesting to note that Donleavy entered into 20 plus years of litigation with the publishing house. He eventually won the case and subsequently owns Olympia Press. But anyway, the book. It is, for better or worse, very real. The \"hero\" Sebastian Dangerfield is a reluctant family man and a reluctant student of law. He just doesn't care about the things which we assume he should care about. He is constantly in a state of scheming his way into the next free drink, or getting into the knickers of an easily led girl. He has no morals, nor does he feel that he should have. He is banking on an inherited wealth which will be his once his sick father dies. The style of the book is modern for the time of it's writing. Donleavy uses both the first person narrative and the third person narrative to illustrate his main character. This can be confusing at first, but I found that after a few chapters, it adds to the urgency/pace (first person) and the backgrounds (third person) as he switches between the two different types of narration. This could not be achieved by sticking to either one of the disciplines. The plot is quite simple, as a character novel should be. The backdrop is Dublin and then later London. Both are described well. The dialogue is at times simply brilliant. One of the few books where you find yourself laughing aloud, and re-reading passages in an attempt to recall lines and slip them into a conversation at some point in the future. It is so easy to see why this book has since been turned into a stage production. I would imagine that the theater would be in fits of giggles. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the development of modern literature. And for that matter anyone with an open mind and a good sense of humour. It is in many ways one of the best novels of the 20th century"}, {"userName": "David Lentz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3604115-david-lentz", "userReview": "JPD launched a storied literary career with a masterpiece in The Ginger Man. Sebastian, which means \"venerable,\" is a man perpetually on the brink of utter madness brought largely upon himself. He is a Trinity College Dublin man whose condition is given to \"staving off starvation\" and whose only option when things always get worse is to \"cheer-up or die.\" When you consider that JPD was first a painter, it's understandable that his writing style is pointillistic. The syntax like Dangerfield is non-traditional presented like life itself in fragments of which to make sense. His little lines of stacked type at the end of each chapter are works of art in themselves: \"All the way/From the land/Of Kerry/Is a man/From the dead/Gone merry./ This man/Stood in the street/ And stamped his feet/ And no one heard him.\" Here the work winds from prose to poetry to create an endearing human quality and even tenderness that enables us to forgive the ginger man for his outrageousness. What would he and his poor as Pozzo crones do with a lot of money? Drink at every pub from College Green to Kerry over the course of a year and then \"I'll arrive on Dingle Peninsula walk out on the end of Slea Head, beat, wet and penniless. I'll sit there and weep into the sea.\" Very Dylan Thomas. A touch Kafkaesque. Joycean. JPD's Ginger Man is worthy of a higher position on Random House's \"Best Novels of the 20th Century.\" His body of work, including \"Darcy Dancer,\" \"Balthazar B,\" \"The Singluar Man,\" \"The Onion Eaters,\" \"Wrong Info at Princeton\" and \"Samuel S.\" is astonishing in its lyric virtuosity, power and originality. When will the mavens of Hollywood treat us to tales by JPD that shimmer and dance upon the silverscreen?

I was simply bored by the events of the novel. I didn\u2019t find it, as all the blurbs promised, an exuberant, witty, wildly comic escapade.

This is certainly one of those. Sebastian Dangerfield is an American studying law at Trinity College in Dublin just after WWII, married and with a daughter, and with a serious drinking problem and a really, really bad attitude. He is a 100% unredeemable character, beating and humiliating his wife and trying to smother his daughter in one of his rages. He very occasionally studies or goes to his classes, but more often is found at the local pubs and fighting with others like him. He has no money, his house is a horror, he sleeps with other women and lies to every one who comes in contact with him.I don't enjoy characters who feel a sense of entitlement, and Sebastian clearly feels he deserves more than he is willing to work for. Somehow the women in his life are completely entranced by him and keep coming back - his wife is probably the smartest of them all, but even she stuck around entirely too long. Sebastian Dangerfield is the same sort of character as Ignatius Reilly in A Confederacy of Dunces, another book which is hailed as being \"brilliant\" that I could not stand. I expect characters in books to have some sort of quality that I would hope to find in a real person. Even if they are disgusting creatures throughout most of the novel, at some time there should be a learning experience, a turning point, in which the character tries to improve his life. I do not feel Sebastian reached that point, which makes me feel that the 347 pages' worth of time I put into it were entirely wasted.On a fun note, however, the copy of this book I purchased (luckily for only a buck at Half Price Books) has names, addresses and phone numbers of people in the front and back covers. I like to think that the person this copy originally belonged to was staying at a hostel and met some interesting folks with whom he planned on communicating later, ranging from Montreal to Maine to the United Kingdom. I hope he/she wrote these numbers down before selling their book. And I hope after I sell it back to the store it doesn't fall into the hands of a stalker, because this would be a gold mine for someone of that nature."}, {"userName": "Mick Stepp", "userReviewDate": "Sep 20, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2736775-mick-stepp", "userReview": "I have to be careful when I talk about this book.

Actually, what they despise is the Sebastian Dangerfield character for he is a drunken, misogynistic, lecherous scoundrel, the very kind of man they are terrified that their daughters might someday meet. The more open minded among them, however, appreciate the quality of Donleavy's rendering, the richness and inventiveness of the language and the out and out hilarity of the story.I love women to the point of reverence and on every real world level find The Ginger Man despicable. But the Ginger Man is not the real world. It's fiction. It's a fabulously written book with a fabulously flawed character. One doesn't accuse a fan of The Silence of the Lambs of being a proponent of cannibalism, right? So lighten up ladies. Read this book for what it is. It's a caricature.

Much like the dialogue in that film, Donleavy's witty, loosely constructed vignettes might be a bit disorienting at first bit they grow on you and you find yourself chuckling more and more especially in the more bizarre stream of consciousness moments (kangaroo costumes, public transportation \"wardrobe malfunctions\"). The other point of reference for me was Tropic Of Cancer as the narrator is also an \"anti hero\" on uninhibited instinct. However, Sebastian here can come across much nastier as he has a wife and child to provide for (unlike Henry Miller who was all by himself in Paris) and he instead drinks constantly and even beats them pretty early on in the book. Sebastian represents the best and worst of human nature and as such is not always traditionally likable as he is both the hero and villain of the book. But his less than savory adventures are written with the kind of imaginative energy and surprisingly subtle wit that makes you wonder (love him or hate him) what will happen next and keeps you turning the pages.

Published in 1955. If there's a reason people don't succeed in working through the Modern Library backwards, it's probably this. \"The Ginger Man\" is a novel for no one, except perhaps sociopathic poser intellectuals who find bawdy antipathy entertaining.I'll start with Donleavy's prose style, the only redeeming thing about the novel. \"The Ginger Man\" swerves wildly between the first and third person, an interior monologue one moment and a systematic sketching of contextual details the next. Since I'm not particularly well-read, and since the novel is set in Dublin, I'm going to make the easy mistake of seeing this as the influence of James Joyce. Donleavy's actual stylistic inspirations are almost certainly subtler than that. So the writing is fine. The problem is Sebastian Dangerfield, our antihero. He's supposed to be a loathsome, drunken rogue. Success! He stumbles through the novel's 300 pages drinking, womanizing, committing acts of petty larceny and domestic violence, and bumming money off of other unlikeable characters. And that's about it. Appparently it's supposed to be funny. In one crucial scene, referenced throughout the remainder of the novel, Dangerfield accidentally rides a train with his penis hanging out of his pants. Hilarious. Maybe \"The Ginger Man\" had a place in 1955. Maybe it inspired later works of dark comedy and contributed to a stylistic evolution in Irish and American literature. Maybe I'm just completely missing something. But I'm glad to be moving on."}, {"userName": "Vit Babenco", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/19283284-vit-babenco", "userReview": "\u201cShe went down the steps.

(The bit of amusement I felt after reading the scene about Skully at the window faded quickly.) But while reading the thing? I laughed only once, and it wasn\u2019t something Sebastian did or said at all but part of a letter he received from his friend in America: \"This is America and we out-produce, out-sell, out-manufacture, out-fight, and out-screw the rest of the world but the latter is elusive.\"There you have it. The only truly funny line in the entire 347 page novel. You may now avoid reading the whole thing to find it, as it is on page 333.So how does it end? Instead of going to jail, Sebastian somehow manages to outrun everyone who is after him and at the end found a rich man who for some unknown reason likes him because, according to the rich guy, Sebastian was nice to him when he wasn\u2019t rich. Which is a load of nonsense because Sebastian \u201cborrowed\u201d money from everyone. The rich guy kept handing him money and clothes and offering to give him haircuts where the novel leaves off with Sebastian shacking up with one of his mistresses having gone through no character development whatsoever. At least his wife finally had the sense to leave him.Do I think the novel deserves to be on a list of the top 100 books of the 20th century? No. Not even the writing style could redeem it. I even think Donleavy\u2019s failed attempt to write something in a stream of consciousness mode made the story that much harder to tolerate. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I like the technique when it\u2019s done well: James Joyce, Virginia Woolf, and Thomas Pynchon are masters. But it\u2019s not a stream, it\u2019s choppy slashed up bits with the occasional phrase in first person, which isn\u2019t clever, and the unraveling of prose into poetry at the end of chapters.

I did laugh. But I also cried at how long I had to spend in the head and world of Sebastian Dangerfield, an American with the English, no Irish, accent of the permanently inebriated. I'm no delicate flower, but Dangerfield's gross debauchery left me \"cold as a eunuch's balls on the quays.\" At one point he calls one of his adulterous escapades \"bestial bedlam.\" And it is. Wife and baby at home, too busy freezing to worry about starving. And Dangerfield? Out feckin' around - admiring the female arse, getting thrown out of bars, or leaving his little dangler out on the train for all to see. Cute.I loved the power of the stream of consciousness narrative though. At first, I found it irritating. Was I reading third person? First? I got into the swing though. Some absolutely brilliant lines. A sample:\"Eight o'clock. The streets were wet, puddles of water on the granite blocks. Western clouds swarming soundlessly catching up the turf smell from the steaming chimney pots on this chill Saturday night. Bird feet moving his soul through this Danish city. The hoarse voices of newsboys punctuating the corners of streets behind. Up here in White Friar Street I can hear them saying rosaries. And in the hospital window, the light goes on and a nurse pulls down the shade.\"That's really lovely. Ghastly character (which is not a crime, I admit) but tremendously interesting writing."}, {"userName": "Judy", "userReviewDate": "Jun 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333943-judy", "userReview": "The long and tortured history of J P Donleavy's first novel parallels the trials and tribulations of Sebastian Dangerfield, anti-hero and bad boy, aka the Ginger Man. Because of sexual content, Donleavy had a heck of a time getting published and until 1965, all versions were expurgated (obscene or objectionable passages deleted.) It is considered a classic as well as Donleavy's best work.As the story opens, Dangerfield is unhappily married to a woman whom he had hoped would bring him money but instead has brought him a daughter and a nagging disposition. You can't really blame her for nagging. Sebastian is a fellow who will pawn items from their furnished apartment and spend it on drink. He is supposed to be attending law school in Dublin but instead he drinks, parties with his buddies and chases women.There is nothing admirable about Sebastian Dangerfield. He is incapable of work and lives only in hopes of inheriting money from his aging, wealthy father. All his friends are the same kinds of guys and they prop each other up while they egg each other on. Yet many women I know, including myself, have fallen for this type of man at least once.The story has humor, pathos and a smidgen of hope that Dangerfield will get it together, but all along the reader knows he won't. I don't understand the appeal but I couldn't stop reading it."}], "description": "First published in Paris in 1955, and originally banned in the United States, J. P. Donleavy\u2019s first novel is now recognized the world over as a masterpiece and a modern classic of the highest order. Set in Ireland just after World War II, The Ginger Man is J. P. Donleavy\u2019s wildly funny, picaresque classic novel of the misadventures of Sebastian Dangerfield, a young American ne\u2019er-do-well studying at Trinity College in Dublin. He barely has time for his studies and avoids bill collectors, makes love to almost anything in a skirt, and tries to survive without having to descend into the bottomless pit of steady work. Dangerfield\u2019s appetite for women, liquor, and general roguishness is insatiable\u2014and he satisfies it with endless charm.", "title": "The Ginger Man", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10365011-the-ginger-man", "average": 3.66, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1328312007l/10365011.jpg", "reviews": 481, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/922006.J_P_Donleavy", "name": "J.P.
