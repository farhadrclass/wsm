I'd rather have 800 pages than 80. BUT this was a VERY cool anthology of short stories by fantastic authors about Mad Scientists. Some were artistic, some were Dr. Horrible-esque, and all were very very enjoyable! Definitely recommend to turn your head around on the bad guy we see in all our genre faves!"}, {"userName": "Miriam", "userReviewDate": "Jul 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/237469-miriam", "userReview": "Favorites:Professor Incognito Apologizes: an Itemized List by Austin GrossmanInstead of a Loving Heart by Jeremiah Tolbert Rural Singularity by Alan Dean FosterHarry and Marlowe Meet the Founder of the Aetherian Revolution by Carrie VaughnRocks Fall by Naomi NovikMofongo Knows by Grady HendrixVaughn's and Tolbert's seemed like parts of larger stories that I'd be interested in reading.A few other stories that I liked less but found noteworthy:\"The Mad Scientist's Daughter\" by Theodora Goss.Actually mad scientists' daughters, plural. All of them living together, trying to make ends meet. Really liked the concept but too many characters for the short length, and not enough action.\"Space Between\" by Diana Gabaldon.This is novella, not a short story. Are there no page limits assigned? Hardly any other author even wrote 20 pages and this was 80. The opening pages with Rakoczy and his allusions to 'the frog' were intriguing but then we switched to a different narrative with a Scottish widower and a lady planning to be a nun who seemed to know nothing about nuns conversing and it was so boring that I looked ahead and saw how long the story was and skimmed a bit and then quit. \"Father of the Groom\" by Harry TurtledoveIs Turtledove always this full of bad puns? and antiquated gender stereotypes?"}, {"userName": "Gavin", "userReviewDate": "May 15, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8192509-gavin", "userReview": "This anthology contained 22 short stories. As with most anthologies the quality varied wildly. I was initially drawn to this anthology because it sounded like a fun premise and it contained short stories from Austin Grossman and Theadora Goss. In the end I was shocked that I liked many of the other short stories better than the ones that caught my eye. Grossman's opening story was actually a bit of a flop. The Goss story fared better, but was only enjoyable rather than anything memorable. My favourites were David D. Levine\u2019s \u201cLetter to the Editor\u201d, Jeremiah Tolbert\u2019s \u201cInstead of a Loving Heart\u201d, and Marjorie M. Liu\u2019s \u201cThe Last Dignity of Man\u201d. All three tales were interesting and emotionally engaging and left me wishing they had been full novels! Naomi Novik\u2019s \u201cRocks Fall\u201d and Genevieve Valentine\u2019s \u201cCaptain Justice Saves the Day\u201d also deserve a special mention. I'll be pursuing more short stories or full novels from these authors at some point in the future. The only truly awful story in the collection was Harry Turtledove\u2019s \u201cFather of the Groom\u201d. I'll be avoiding his books! Some short thoughts and my rating for each of the individual stories: \"Professor Incognito Apologizes: an Itemized List\" by Austin GrossmanI was actually a bit disappointed in the opening story. Which is a pity as it was the one I was most looking forward to reading. It was not half so much fun or interesting as Soon I Will Be Invincible was. I wonder if that is because the itemized list premise just did not work out well in audio. This is basically a list where Professor Incognito apologizes to his girlfriend for a few things. Mostly from keeping secrets from her, but also about the fact that he is secretly a supervillan and has just succeeded in selling out the planet earth to an invading Martian horde! It had a bit of humor and a offered an interesting commentary on the nature of a relationship, but on the whole was nowhere near as funny or interesting as Grossman's Soon I Will Be Invincible. Rating: 2.5 stars.\"Father of the Groom\" by Harry TurtledoveIn this short story the father of the groom decides to literally make his new daughter in law into a bridezilla. It sounds like it should be a good premise for some light hearted hilarity. Unfortunately it did not play out that way. The omnipotent narrator gave the whole story a pompous and arrogant feel.Rating: 2 stars. \"Laughter at the Academy\" by Seanan McGuireThis tale featured a very different sort of mad scientist. A devious and murderous psychologist who used her own special area of study to push scientists in other fields into madness. The story was OK, but had no real hook that grabbed my attention. Rating: 2.5 stars.\"Letter to the Editor\" by David D. LevineThis was the first truly engaging story in the anthology. This is the story of Doctor Talon, the arch nemesis of the famed alien superhero Ultimate Man. He explains, in the form of an open letter to the wider world, that rather than a mad scientist supervillain he is actually a misunderstood saviour of humanity. I found our narrator's tale to be an engaging and fascinating one. The story had an incredible and unique take on a superman like hero. Rating: 4.5 stars.\"Instead of a Loving Heart\" by Jeremiah TolbertThis was another excellent short story. The tone was surprisingly sad as this story was told from the POV of ZED03 an android slave/servant of a mad scientist. The mad scientist in question is seeking to create an even greater AI in the hopes that it will eventually supplant humanity and in doing so prove its creators genius. ZED03 was once fully human before his mad master ripped his brain from his body and placed it in his now inhuman shell. ZED03 fears becoming obsolete once his masters new creation comes into existence and despairs over the fact that he can no longer create the art he used to love while a human. He was a fascinating character. Despite this being one of the shorter stories in the anthology we still got a glimpse of potentially interesting world. It is a pity this was never expanded into a full length novel as there was infinite potential for more fascinating stories in this world. Rating: 4.5 stars. \"The Executor\" by Daniel H. WilsonThis was another strangely sad tale. It was about a man who desperately wanted to save his daughter's life. To do see he needs a lot more money than he has the ability to earn. The solution is a simple one. He needs to attempt to pass the tests of The Executor. The Executor is a genius AI who was created by a mad scientist 200 years ago. The robot guards, and successfully manages, the largest fortune in the world. A fortune that can be claimed by any member of the mad scientist's descendant's who can pass the Executor's tests. Unfortunately for our the Executor is not the only one with a vested interest in making sure no one passes his test.The futuristic world seemed an interesting one and the lead character was easy to sympathize and root for. The only real flaw in this story was that Wilson tended to slow the pacing by being overly descriptive in his writing. Rating: 3.5 stars.\"The Angel of Death Has a Business Plan\" by Heather LindsleyThis proved to be another very engaging story that had a good blend of action and humor while also managing to be strangely dark. The Angel of Death is an aspiring supervillain in her own right, but a lack of funds has forced her to set up as a counsellor and superhero surrogate for other supervillians. She helps boost their self confidence or simply listens to their villainous monologues! She has her own dreams of world domination and means to follow her own advice to see her goals achieved.In a world packed with larger than life superheroes and supervillains our determined narrator proved to be the stand out character. I'd have prefered a different ending, but I guess it was in keeping with the tone of the story. Rating: 4 stars. \"Homo Perfectus\" by David Farland - another 3 starThis was actually a super creepy story. A new employee for a brilliant pharmaceutical company finds herself being tested by the company's director and founder while thinking she is on a dinner date. Our mad scientist in this one came across as part spy and part date rapist as he uses his drugs to manipulate both himself and his date. The twist at the end was fairly interesting and just about saved the story from being too disturbing. Rating: 3 stars. \"Ancient Equations\" by L. A. BanksThis was a mix of fantasy and sci-fi as the mad scientist in question was trying to summon a Goddess with a mix of magic and physics. This mad scientist was perhaps the craziest in the whole anthology, but it was also easy to sympathize with him as he was trapped in a lonely and isolated existence. If I had to pick for faults, I'd say the tone of this story was just a bit crude at times for my liking. The ending was also left open to the readers imagination.Rating: 3 stars\"Rural Singularity\" by Alan Dean FosterI'm not sure what to say about this story. Like most of Alan Dean Foster's work it is perfectly readable, but not particularly memorable. A journalist is dispatched to a rural farm to investigate the reports of a two-headed chicken. It is a slow news week and the journalist expects to get there and find the whole thing is just a money grabbing hoax. Except it turns out it is not. The farmer's daughter is not entirely sane, but she is a genius, and her inventions go far beyond just some genetically mutated chickens. The story was OK.Rating: 3 stars.\"Captain Justice Saves the Day\" by Genevieve ValentineBrenda is the assistant to a crazed mad scientist. The guy might be an evil genius, but he cannot even competently deal with people for long enough to order a pizza! The madman's last assistant has disappeared without a trace and Brenda suspects she know why when her boss suggests she let him strap her to his latest doomsday device as a damsel in distress lure to entice the heroic Captain Justice. Brenda mulls the idea over before decided to give it a try. This story was both fun and humorous. Brenda was a likeable character and proved you do not need to be a mad scientist to be smart or a muscle-bound superhero to save the day!Rating: 4 stars. \"The Mad Scientist\u2019s Daughter\" by Theodora GossThis was the story of what life might be like for a group of daughters of mad scientists after their fathers died. We had the offspring from the likes of Jekyll, Frankenstein, and Moreau as well as others. It was an interesting story. Not one high on action, but a thoughtful and interesting tale.Rating: 3.5 stars The Space Between by Diana GabaldonThis one felt out of place for the anthology. For one thing it was about 10 times the length of the average short story in this collection. It also lacked the mad scientist theme. It was more of a historical paranormal tale. It turned out this was actually a novella from Gabaldon's Outlander series. Which makes sense considering this felt like a story where the reader should already be familiar with some of the characters and with the magic of the world. Since I was not it was actually quite confusing at times. It did not work great as a standalone novella.I found this a little slow paced and confusing and did not particularly enjoy all the Scottish lingo from days of yore. The story did hold my interest at times so it was not all bad.Rating: 2.5 stars. \"Harry and Marlowe Meet the Founder of the Aetherian Revolution\" by Carrie VaughnThis was an interesting short story set in an intriguing alienpunk(rather than steampunk) world. Harry and Marlowe investigate a notorious mad scientist's lair for signs that he has lapsed back to his old ways. I found the story quite enjoyable. I wish this had been a set up for a larger series with these characters and this world. Rating: 4 stars.\"Blood and Stardust\" by Laird BarronThis story is a tough one to rate and review. It was told from the first person perspective of a female Igor as she explained a bit about her life as an assistant to a mad scientist and her plans to escape. It was hard to decide what to think of Mary, the main character. She was definitely villainous, but I still managed to sympathize with her. The story was bizarre, but interesting. Its main flaw is it was confusing and hard to follow at times.Rating: 3 stars. \"A More Perfect Union\" by L. E. Modesitt, Jr.The mad scientist in question in this story was a political strategist. We follow the progress of his candidate through from the early regional elections right through to eventual leadership of a futuristic North America. This one could have been quite clever, and it did have its moments, but on the whole it came across as a bit dry and boring.Rating: 2 stars.\"Rocks Fall\" by Naomi NovikThis was excellent. Very short, but captivating and emotionally engaging. It mainly focused on a short conversation between a supervillain and a superhero as they waited, trapped in the ruins of a collapsed building, for the rescue team to reach them. With neither person knowing who's men lead the rescue team. Both the characters were fascinating individuals and the story managed a few twists in its short length. I was left wishing for more. Rating: 4.5 stars.\"We Interrupt This Broadcast\" by Mary Robinette KowalThis was quite an interesting and sad tale. It was not action packed, but was interesting for how easy it was to sympathize with and like the mad scientist despite what he plans to do. Rating: 3.5 stars.\"The Last Dignity of Man\" by Marjorie M. LiuThis was the second longest story in the collection and I think it made good use of that time to build both the story and the character. It was a melancholy tale. It asked the question does a man make a name or does a name make a man. Alexander Luther believes the latter. Though he is never quite as villainous as he thinks he is.I found the story enjoyable and engaging.Rating: 4.5 stars. \"Pittsburg Technology\" by Jeffrey FordThis story never really worked for me. It was about a guy who was not happy with his life and found himself using his savings to buy into the Pittsburg Technology in the hopes it could improve his life. It was sort of like one of those get rich quick schemes. With similar results!Rating: 2 stars. \"Mofongo Knows\" by Grady HendrixThis was another short story that fell just a little flat for me. Geniues ape Mofongo has been imprisoned by his nemesis for years. Only now his jailer has died. Mofongo discovers that he is no longer considered a relevant threat and that his Nemesis's adult daughter is shipping him off to a retirement sanctuary for apes. The story is an allegory for old age and the losing of ones mental faculties. It could have been quite poignant if it had been executed better. Rating: 3 stars.\"The Food Taster\u2019s Boy\" by Ben WintersThis was a poor way to end the anthology. I'm still not sure what the point of this story was. To show that we yearn for things, but are still not really happy even when we have the things we yearned for? Rating: 2 starsOverall anthology rating: 4 stars. It was worth reading for the good short stories. The lesser tales were not that bad and all were quite short with the exception of the Outlander novella. My advice it to skip that one if you do not like the start. Audio Note: This was narrated by Stefan Rudnicki, Mary Robinette Kowal, and Justine Eyre. I like Rudnicki as a narrator for hard sci-fi stories and while he did OK here his narration is not ideal for humorous stories. Both Kowal and Eyre were excellent. Kowal is one of the very few authors I've encountered who is genuinely talented when it comes to audio narration!"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Jun 21, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/695116-jim", "userReview": "I generally like to review each story, but so far they've all been short, appropriately humorous, & quite good (3-3.5 stars, at least).

The stories range far and wide; while the mad scientists are the focus, they don't always tell the story but nevertheless, we see them in lights, contexts and situations unheard of and unseen before. In all, the stories are unique and creative even though, some of them have structural frames rather similar to that of tales of superheros. There's a gradual change in the tone of stories as the anthology progresses: the telling becomes graver, and stories less comical, discerning and more focused, which unfortunately, also decreased their selling points. In the shadow of riotous stories prior to them, their tone becomes almost unbearable and straightforward.Professor Incognito Apologizes: An Itemized List by Austin Grossman.In this one, the supervillain leaves a long list of apologies and explanations for his fiance after he dooms the world by handing it over to Martians. There are yet surprises to be revealed in the story but the Professor's voice- arrogant yet trying hard to make amend- was a breath of fresh air. Yet after a while, his apologies/narration started to grate on my nerves because of repetition.Father of the Groom by Harry TurtledoveAnother hilarious excerpt into a mad mind's everyday life. I appreciated the author's writing, especially its occasional smugness. Yet there's really no point to the story and it remains constrained to its beginning, but that's not really a demerit.Laughter at the Academy by Seanan McGuireThis story was dark but not by much. It's very straightforward and there's little appeal to the characters as it's told by a detective who's looking to identify and capture the supervillain. But it was fun, nevertheless. And the world building was interesting, to say the least.Letter to the Editor by David D. LevineHa! This was intriguing and made me see supervillains in a new light. Basically, Doctor Talon, supervillain extraordinaire is dead of leukemia(I think) but has left his legacy to the world in the form of an explanation of his actions against the world's savior. What draws me to the story yet still is that it draws paradigms to our society of winner/powerful writing the history and controlling the present.Instead of a Loving Heart by Jeremiah TolbertHmmm. I'm not sure what to say about this one. Ambiguity is a big theme of its ending, I think, but the whole story is one I'm ambiguous about. While the artist and all that he lost, all that he does were written in an evocative manner, the story never grabbed my by the collar.The Executor by Daniel H. WilsonI could've loved this story but there were too many unnecessary details, unsavory paragraphs that I had trouble not skimming because they were so monotonous. But I did skim, and that made the story so much more heartfelt and to the point. It's about a father who wants to save his daughter but doesn't have the means to. I liked the emotion and the plot, but the execution and tools used were crap.The Angel of Death has a Business Plan by Heather LindsleySO MUCH YES. The story was entertaining throughout and ended with a bang that complemented the story, even if it was of the norm. The Angel of Death works as a counselor to supervillains, helping them to aim for their heroes and resist the urge to go Voldemort style- giving speeches when they just need to kill.Homo Perfectus by David FarlandA slice of life supervillain-style! On a date! But simple and boring. The only difference was in the narration. Keeps the notion that supervillains like isolation in check. Ancient Equations by L. A. BanksSuper-freaking-fantastic! The beginning was slow and trivial, where the narrator just keeps whining and yapping, but once it gets going, and entered gods and monsters, it was delicious. It's another of the story where supervillains look for partners in crime. It'll NEVER pan out, I suppose. The ending has me a bit confused, and my sister and I had opposing ideas about it but whatever.Captain Justice Saves the Day by Genevieve ValentineBrenda is a supervillain's assistant so this one is basically about all the dirt deeds behind the curtains. A must especially since Brenda is an engaging and figuratively kick-ass narrator.The Space Between by Diana GabaldonThis story had me the most excited but sadly, it was the one that let me down the most. Not only is it convoluted and prolonged, there's also an outrageously serious tone that the rest of the stories follow. It's a wearying story and I couldn't finish it.Anyways, the rest of the stories didn't either retain my attention or there's nothing to comment upon.Review copy provided by Tor/Forge."}, {"userName": "Tim Hicks", "userReviewDate": "Sep 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/111076-tim-hicks", "userReview": "This just barely made three stars. Mostly, I am remembering Diana Gabaldon's long story/novella which is set in her Outlander world. Many here bought the book just for that. Maybe for them it was good. For me it was a complex story that ended with a giant Pfffft! Big, long buildup, and thud, it's over with nothing resolved. I suspect many who aren't into the Outlander series found this story disappointing. And it's full of unnecessary Scottish dialect -which I am quite familiar with, it just wasnae needed. The repeated references to clenching wames were unnecessary decoration that distracted. A lighter touch would have sufficed to present them as Scots. A couple of others just left me flat, too. Took an idea, ran with it, ended up nowhere special - and made it into the book anyway. But there were some that earned, \"Heh, heh, that was clever.\" Which stories were which? Ah, I won't tell, because the ones that succeed or fail for you won't likely be the same as mine.

If his powers and abilities were always increasing, when would he lose control? Would he even know that he was moving towards loss of it? And how would we protect ourselves?

But that\u2019s not exactly correct. Unlike Dr Frankenstein he isn\u2019t just doing it for science he really does hope it will take over the world and displace humanity.

Years pass. Decades pass and no one can claim the inheritance. Until one man tries and fails, but then tries again for his daughter\u2019s sake.

Levine is all about how having good publicity can be the difference between 'Mad Genius Threatens Crowd with Heat Ray' and 'Philanthropist Inventor Staves Off Global Destruction.'- \"Rural Singularity\" by Alan Dean Foster takes the tricky route of idiot savante and traverses\u00a0the dangerous path of what if creative science fell\u00a0into the wrong hands.- Ever wonder what would happen if a hero and a villain got trapped in a cave? \"Rocks Fall\" by Naomi Novik digs into that budding relationship, revealing how even the evilest villains can have some empathy.Finally,\u00a0let's remember to sing the praises of the ones who aid their mad scientists:- \"Instead of a Loving Heart\" by Jeremiah Tolbert is a heart-twisting retelling of the Tin Man in which an artist's brain is shoved into a helper bot, forced to serve his evil master, who doesn't appreciate art.- On the other hand, \"Captain Justice Saves the Day\" by Genevieve Valentine has a willing assistant, one who puts up with her employer's demands, always making sure to be one step ahead of him.- And, of course, \"Blood & Stardust\" by Laird Barron, giving you a whole new Igor, one who's going to get her freedom even if it means getting her hands dirty in the meantime.I admit this is only a tasting of what's inside the covers. If I listed any more, I'd be itemizing the entire anthology.You'll notice I'm not discussing any of the tales I wanted to punch in the face (and I sincerely did). I'm also not going to super-whine about that one super long story that felt so out of place and then hit me with an unnecessary sex scene. Nope. I'm going to remain positive in this review because this book deserves it.Mad scientists. Some of them want to rule the world while others want to save it. Some do it alone, some require help.\u00a0All of them make you wonder about the limits of imaginations and their worth to\u00a0the world.{Check out this review at Entropy Alarm Reviews}"}, {"userName": "Caitlin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 16, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4802875-caitlin", "userReview": "Check out Books Are My Drug for other reviews.My review copy was an eARC provided for free by Tor through Netgalley.Reviewing short story collections is tough. No matter how much work the collector put into it, there\u2019s always going to be one or two that you don\u2019t think work. I can\u2019t give a rundown review of all of them, so what I am going to do is discuss a few I thought were good, a few I thought\u2026 weren\u2019t, and then talk about how well the collection works together.The first story (Professor Incognito Apologizes: An Itemized List by Austin Grossman) is a strong opener, which is always necessary in a collection. Witty, amusing and a nice riff on the supervillain theme, as well as on the nature of the lies we tell about ourselves to the people we love. Also, I jsut love the writing. Grossman is a strong writer, and does humour well. In three more weeks I had a working blaster, and we met to see Hannah and Her Sisters at the Regent. I fell asleep on your shoulder, dreaming the genetic code for a race of sentient tigers.Wonderful. But as well as being funny, it\u2019s also quite an honest and touching look at a troubled and turbulent relationship, where both parties have been lying about something big. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s more than one reader that can relate.From that onto another story about villains and love, except this one is by Harry Turtledove and there\u2019s not much to say except the fact that I\u2019ve never really liked his writing and this short didn\u2019t convince me otherwise. That may be heresy, but I am what I am and I\u2019ve never been keen on that sort of self-conscious trope acknowledgement. Far too arch and knowing. Clever, but in love with its own cleverness. Blah. Not for me.There are a couple of good-but-not-great pieces before we get to the next one I really liked \u2013 Instead Of A Loving Heart by Jeremiah Tolbert, a story about artificial intelligence and true, uncaring evil. It\u2019s very sad, and bleak, and it makes my heart hurt to read.I simply do not have enough space to review the entirety of the rest of the collection, but in all I was pretty impressed. There were plenty of good stories, a few great ones and very few bad stories \u2013 though there were a couple I thought were mediocre, or that I thought didn\u2019t fit. In general, it\u2019s a well-curated collection, with most of the stories being above average and working together very well to increase the strength of the whole. I may have to track down a physical copy for dipping in and out."}, {"userName": "Kate", "userReviewDate": "Apr 13, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5229815-kate", "userReview": "[bridezilla is played as humorous, and the story seems to be trying to perpetuate harmful stereotypes of women planning weddings, and as someone who finds the term \"bridezilla\" to be dismissive and generally hurtful to women, I didn't like the story.

Ah gots ta put Grossman on my TBR list.Harry Turtledove\u2019s \u201cFather of the Groom\u201d plays off the bridezilla that has become too common in our North American society and demonstrates how a mad scientist would deal with her! Take notes!Seanan McGuire\u2019s \u201cLaughter at the Academy: A Field Study in the Genesis of Schizotypal Creative Genius Personality Disorder (SCGPD)\u201d demonstrates the suspicious nature of an advanced college degree, clearly a sign of madness, lol. And McGuire is quite sneaky in this one!David D. Levine\u2019s \u201cLetter to the Editor\u201d takes the form of an editorial complaining about the misperception the public has on the public service he\u2019s doing for the world. Yup, another funny one.Jeremiah Tolbert\u2019s \u201cInstead of a Loving Heart\u201d is gruesome as he slowly reveals the truth behind Dr. Octavio\u2019s assistant. I am curious as to what happened to Lucinda.Daniel H. Wilson\u2019s \u201cThe Executor\u201d is a sad tale of a loving father wanting to help his baby girl and the trust he must go up against to claim the fortune his mad scientist ancestor left for whoever can win it. The choices he makes just make me cry\u2026 I could wish Wilson would pen a sequel; I bet it\u2019d be bloody!Heather Lindsley\u2018s \u201cThe Angel of Death Has a Business Plan\u201d is yet another funny with a\u2026hmmm\u2026can I say nasty twist? It\u2019s a twist on the expected trope that benefits one person if no one else in the world, lol. It will take you aback.David Farland\u2018s \u201cHomo Perfectus\u201d takes the shape of a date with a test. I love how Farland uses dinner to explain what Chancellor Pharmaceutical does and their requirements of their employees. And yes, there\u2019s another twist at the end. L.A. Banks\u2019 \u201cAncient Equations\u201d pokes fun at Ernest Lassiter and his totally organic approach to life. I do think he should have stuck with the totally natural, though.Alan Dean Foster\u2019s \u201cRural Singularity\u201d tells the tale of a too-eager reporter who doesn\u2019t know when to stop, although I can understand his desire for access to Suzie\u2019s inventions! I definitely want her generator.Genevieve Valentine\u2019s \u201cCaptain Justice Saves the Day\u201d is definitely a twist on the mad scientist assistant role. And thank god for Brenda! We need more practical assistants like her. I\u2019ll bet Captain Justice is thrilled with her!Theodora Goss\u2019 \u201cThe Mad Scientist\u2019s Daughter\u201d should really be plural since it\u2019s a club of six daughters, all descended from mad scientists. It supposedly explores how genetics affect the mind, but it seems to veer more toward how being raised by mad scientists affect their child \u2014 nature versus nurture.Diana Gabaldon\u2018s \u201cThe Space Between\u201d follows two separate people: the Comte St. Germain and Joan MacKimmie, The comte is obsessing about time travel and Ma\u00eetre Raymond with a side worry about La Dame Blanche. The comte does have an interesting addition to traveling through the stones using precious metal to make the passage easier and smoother, and one of his acquaintances, M\u00e9lisande, has left the comte afile powder that she got from Rose Hall in Jamaica.Meanwhile, Jamie\u2019s stepdaughter is on her way to Mother Hildegarde\u2019s convent in Paris. We get a glimpse of the tattooed Ian Murray with his advice to Michael Murray on how to survive the death of one\u2019s spouse. Interesting bit in here about the Parisian cemeteries. I hadn\u2019t realized the French still hadn\u2019t put the dead into the ossuaries.Carrie Vaughan\u2019s \u201cHarry and Marlowe Meet the Founder of the Aetherian Revolution\u201d is a subrosa look at a sequestered murder and the inventor of this new technology that supposedly makes life in late Victorian England so much easier. A bit gruesome. Laird Barron\u2019s \u201cBlood & Stardust\u201d is a confusing short story about a female Igor, time travel, and circuses. This Mary hates her boss and eventually plots her freedom.L.E. Modesitt, Jr.\u2019s \u201cA More Perfect Union\u201d is a horror story \u2014 it\u2019s too close to reality in how political aides and managers manipulate elections and the men for whom they work. Naomi Novik\u2019s \u201cRocks Fall\u201d will make you cry. Novik has created a glimpse into the life, death?, of a superhero and his nemesis, and for such a short story, it is filled with a wealth of background. Then Novik ends it with hope on your part that they\u2019ll get the guy. Damn it.Mary Robinette Kowal\u2019s \u201cWe Interrupt This Broadcast\u201d finds Fidel Dobes with no intention of letting American politicians bully the rest of the world, for the U.S. won too big after World War II and is taking its preeminence too much to heart. A little math, a few punch cards, and no one will ever know. Scary thoughts, from both ends and a little too close to home.Marjorie M. Liu\u2019s \u201cThe Last Dignity of Man\u201d has some fun with Alexander Luthor buying in a little too hard on those comic books. All it takes is one honest man to make it okay. Now what we\u2019ll do about those government idiots\u2026Jeffrey Ford\u2019s \u201cThe Pittsburgh Technology\u201d pokes fun at all those \u201cget rich quick\u201d ads.

Barnum was right: \u201cThere\u2019s a sucker born every minute.\u201dGrady Hendrix\u2019s \u201cMofongo Knows\u201d takes off on early twentieth century adventure stories with a super-bright gorilla who almost took over the world. In some ways, Mo\u2019 ain\u2019t too bright. Ben H. Winters\u2019 \u201cThe Food Taster\u2019s Boy\u201d finds a dictator whose rule has been going on too long, and he\u2019s bored. Bored, bored, bored. So bored, that he tries to set up a future bad scenario. I gotta say, it sounds like the kind of thing a crazed, bored dictator would do. The CoverThe cover is shades of green with a splodge of orange and yellow inside the glass container \u2014 and no, I don\u2019t want to look too closely at its contents \u2014 ICK! It\u2019s bad enough having to look at the mad scientist with his squared-off glasses, half-bald with his long, stringy, white hair flaring out behind his head, those bared teeth with the gaps between them in that rictus of a smile.

Mad scientists pop up fairly frequently in comic books, movies, and television shows, but they don't seem to be explored as much in fiction. We have the classics, like Doctors Jekyll, Frankenstein, and Moreau, among others, but I was interested to see these sorts of characters tackled in prose.While several stories do succeed in taking a tongue-in-cheek look at mad scientist supervillains, I appreciated more the stories that took the subject seriously and really dug into the psychology of these people. What drives a person to create monstrosities, to break the laws of God and man? Are they evil? Or simply curious?The most popular type of story is the superhero/supervillain setting, but the collection is fairly diverse, especially since it doesn't confine itself to focusing on the mad scientists themselves, telling stories from the perspectives of assistants, family members, reporters, and, in one case, a robot. I must also mention that one story is about a mad scientist gorilla. A mad scientist gorilla.Some of my favorite stories include Austin Grossman's \"Professor Incognito Apologizes: An Itemized List,\" which is even more hilarious than it sounds, and David D. Levine's \"Letter to the Editor,\" structured as a letter to the editor from a Lex Luthor-esque figure claiming that his evil deeds were done in the name of saving the world from a Superman-esque figure. Seanan McGuire's \"Laughter at the Academy: A Field Study in the Genesis of Schizotypal Creative Genius Personality Disorder (SCGPD)\" tells you what's going on right in the title, yet the slow reveal is wickedly sinister. Alan Dean Foster's \"Rural Singularity\" is a winning tale of a country girl who has created two-headed chickens...among other things. And Marjorie M. Liu's \"The Last Dignity of Man\" is goddamn fantastic, the story of a man named Alexander Luthor who struggles with living up\u2014or down\u2014to the fictional character whose name he shares and obsesses over Superman.I could praise nearly every story in the book. Some are a bit unfulfilling or confusing, but most are quite strong and present an interesting take on the topic. The one black mark is Diana Gabaldon's \"The Space Between,\" a novella that has almost nothing at all do with mad science and whose inclusion is mystifying and irritating, given that those 80 pages could have gone to four interesting stories.For any of you interested in taking over the world with SCIENCE!!, this book is required reading.

The longest story in this collection by far is by Gabaldon (no surprise) and this novella was also the least \u201cmad sciency\u201d story of the lot.As with all anthologies, there were a couple of clunkers mixed in, but I\u2019ve been drawn to John Joseph Adams\u2019 collections before primarily because he has the uncanny ability to pick and choose the kinds of stories that I enjoy the most. Often, with other anthologists, I find too many stories included that apparently are of high literary merit but seem to lack any interest for me.

Some of them are from author\u2019s who I\u2019ve liked over the years, including Austin Grossman, author of Soon I Will Be Invincible, Seanan McGuire, author of the Newsflesh novels and the October Daye novels, and Harry Turtledove. And others I had never heard of but will certainly be checking out now that I\u2019ve read some of their material, such as Theodora Goss, Laird Barron, and Jeffery Ford. That\u2019s what makes anthologies great, with the world of books expanding and with time so crunched in what we can read it\u2019s hard to pick out and find new authors. Adam\u2019s compiles a top notch level of authors, and while not all of them were my favorites, there were enough in there that did strike my fancy, that I have no trouble recommending this book as a fun and worth wile anthology.Now, if I had to pick my favorite from the book, I\u2019d have to say it was Austin Grossman\u2019s Professor Incognito Apologizes: An Itemized List. Not only was it hilarious and original, but it reminded me why I loved reading Grossman\u2019s works, in fact so much so that I went out and pre-ordered YOU, his new book coming out in April. The story is a memo of the inner workings of Doctor Incognito\u2019s love life and plan to take over the world. It is funny, engaging, and makes me wish there were more to read on the doctor\u2019s adventures.All in all this was a fun book that introduced me to interesting new authors.

That said, I really liked this collection of stories. I don't know if it's all the comic book movies being popular these days, but I was in just the right mood for something like this.It wasn't all perfect. I really enjoyed the first half of the stories in the collection but thought things got less interesting/slower in the second half. It may have been that some stories shared some similarities and the repetition got tiresome, but I don't think so. I think it was actually that the second half of the stories had more of a serious tone to them that just didn't go as well with me as the more humorous first half.Non story stuff: I really liked Chris Claremont's introduction to the book. I thought it brought some interesting insights into why the bad guy is so important for the hero. I thought John Joseph Adams' introductions to each story were helpful although a bit confusing in the audiobook format (it took a few stories before I understood what the heck was going on with the scientific categorization). I thought they helped me get into the story faster since I kind of knew what to expect and I do think I enjoyed the short stories more as a result. Some would say they spoil the stories but I didn't think they revealed any more than the back of a novel would about its story.Stories: This is hard because there are 22 stories in this collection. Many are humorous and have interesting spins on the common tropes you'd expect from mad scientist or superhero stories. I generally liked all the stories but I'd say my favorites were Professor Incognito Apologizes, The Angel of Death Has a Business Plan, Captain Justice Saves the Day, and Rocks Fall. I didn't overly dislike any stories except for The Space Between by Diana Gabaldon. The story is by far the longest and I had trouble following the different character's stories and understanding the point of the story. It appears that story is from a series by her so it may be that I didn't like it because I haven't read her other works.Audiobook specific: I really like all three readers of this collection. I thought they did a fantastic job with their voice acting. I would definitely listen to books performed by these readers again. I particularly liked Mary Robinette Kowal's performances. She does a great job doing voices of people trying to be patient with the mad scientists - whether it be their therapist, assistant, or fellow evil genius.TOR.com has posted some of the stories online to read for free and those would be a good litmus test if this is the book for you. Professor Incognito Apologizes: an Itemized List by Austin Grossman is a great example of the more humorous offerings and The Mad Scientist\u2019s Daughter by Theodora Goss is a good example of the more serious stories."}, {"userName": "All Things Urban Fantasy", "userReviewDate": "Dec 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2732683-all-things-urban-fantasy", "userReview": "Review courtesy of All Things Urban FantasyI have a confession to make \u2013 I\u2019m not usually a big fan of anthologies. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s because I get annoyed that there\u2019s not more to the story or what, but short stories and I have never gotten along. So of course I went with an anthology for my first review here at All Things Urban Fantasy. Oops. Or at least oops is what I was thinking when I first sat down to start the book. Then I started reading and that oops quickly changed in to a grin as I dived in to story after story.This topic is absolutely perfect for the short story format. I may not want to read an entire book from the evil genius\u2019 point of view, but reading a couple dozen pages from said point of view was certainly fun. Way more fun than I was certainly expecting.From the delightful opening \u201capology\u201d letter written by Austin Grossman to the closing story by Ben Winters there wasn\u2019t a bad story in the bunch.

I don't think I'm helping my case that scientists are people too... I expected something heartfelt, or at least some sort of rational justification for carting lab equipment to [insert ludicrous location like volcano, ocean, the moon, etc.], where you're absolutely certain no rep is going to uphold their service agreement. When you're centrifuge blows up because some douchbag is breaking into your lab releasing your most recent attempt at scientific genius in to (or on to) the general public, putting your lab back together is going to be impossible. Tucker and Dale style, \"this was all a huge mistake, and you just don't understand what's going on,\" would have been an awesome and hilarious take for such a unique point of view. I also thought the writing style would be more complex, as it is supposedly coming from a scientist, evil or not. It's not, and the condescending tone [could have been my interpretation colored by \"evil scientist\" remarks for the last 10 years] just made it worse. I'm sure I'm biased but even the comedic value was slapstick/ simplistic and just left me irritated. I can assure you I am most certainly not writing this from a secret lab in a ridiculously complex location, and scientists are just like everyone else. REAL science is in fact MUCH more boring than the media portrays. I can always tell when someone is about to \"science\" something because they start the centrifuge up, like it's some sort of mythical disease crystal ball. I read this exactly two years ago, so the details are sketchy at best, other than the general feeling of hate/ despise/ loathing I had at the conclusion, which I carry with me to this day. --this message has been sent from the secret underground lab of Sirius Scientist--"}, {"userName": "Matthew Barron", "userReviewDate": "Aug 17, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18966231-matthew-barron", "userReview": "This was a great concept for an anthology, and great fun to see where different authors took the mad scientist theme. Some broke away from the hard sciences and included mad social scientists, mad mathematicians, and mad political scientists. Many stories in this collection are full of camp and superhero parody, but I was surprised to find drama and philosophy too. There were three stories in the middle of the book that I felt were quite slow. The Mad Scientist\u2019s Daughter was a great idea, and I feel that the author was trying to create a celebration of the mundane for his fantastic cast, but it made for a dry story. The Space Between took a long time to develop and didn\u2019t fit the theme as well as some of the other stories. A More Perfect Union covered a long period of time with a distant narrator, which made it hard to get a feel for the characters. I\u2019m glad I kept reading, however, because two of my absolute favorite stories from this collection are in the second half of the book. The Last Dignity of Man took me completely by surprise. It was an interesting concept that started out harmless, but when the characters were in jeopardy, I found myself really caring about them. This is quite an accomplishment from author Marjorie M. Liu. Mofongo Knows by Grady Hendrix is also one of my favorites in this collection. If you like talking gorillas or old pulps, you will like this story. In the first half of the book, Tin Man was another favorite. Those three stories alone are worth the price of the book. The reader may want to save the story introductions until after they have read the stories."}, {"userName": "B.

Nay--years. They say that the villain is the hero of his own story. Nowhere is that more true than the pages of this book. And, as fate would deem it, many times the villains story is extremely humorous. I had many laugh-out-loud moments while reading this book. Not a grin. Not a snicker. A full-blown laugh. While most of the stories in this book were just... great (there's no other word for it), there are a few that were a little more of a struggle, but ultimately paid off. I'd recommend this to adults who've graduated out of reading comic books, to young adults who may read comic books, to folks looking for nice bite-sized stories to read over their lunch hour, to superhero prose enthusiasts, and to absolutely anyone who needs a good laugh.As my digital ARC of this book is self-deleting, I will be buying a copy of this when it comes out, as I want to read these stories again and share them with others."}, {"userName": "Paul Harmon", "userReviewDate": "May 18, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9723640-paul-harmon", "userReview": "I did this as an audio book.Like all Anthologies it had highs and lows, It had some good stories but as I went on I became less interested.The Worst for me were Modesitt's A more perfect Union which bored me badly, then getting worse LA Bank's Ancient equations...yeah lets resort to sex...it bores me. And finally with almost all of the stories coming in around a half hour give or take Diana Gabaldon having a 4 HOUR! story was something I dreaded from the beginning and saved it for last...I can't take Gabaldon's writing for 15 minutes let alone a 4 hour story and thats what happened after 15 minutes I was so bored and zoned out I quit. Ive tried her stuff and Ive hated every work Ive tried to read. Ive never been able to even complete one single things she's written including short stories.

The longest story in the book -- one about the respective \"daughters\" of such luminaries as Dr. Frankenstein, Dr. Jekyll, Mr. Hyde, Dr. Moreau, etc -- seems to go on forever without actually having a whole lot to say (although I suspect that's very much a personal preference thing rather than the story itself not being well written).All in all, it was a decent light summer read, with a couple of interesting concepts and a couple of stories that didn't quite hit the mark for me."}, {"userName": "Mattison", "userReviewDate": "Jan 07, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/45878049-mattison", "userReview": "This is a collection of mad scientist themed short stories from various authors. As with most such books, I like some, I get bored with others. I particularly enjoyed Professor Ignognito Apologizes: An Itemize list, by Austin Grossman, where our mad scientist apologizes for lying to his girlfriend, when she discovers his secret identity. The Laughter at the Academy, by Seanan McGuire was also a great story of mad social sciences slipping through the cracks of a global effort to monitor potential mad scientists. Rural Singularity by Alan Dean Foster, is also an amusing tale about farmer's dauther mad scientists. The one bad thing I'll say about the book is that my least favorite of the short stories was the least short one. Diana Gabaldon's The Space Between, has satisfying ending, but I found its beginning and middle a little dull and long."}], "description": "From Victor Frankenstein to Lex Luthor, from Dr. Moreau to Dr. Doom, readers have long been fascinated by insane plans for world domination and the madmen who devise them.
