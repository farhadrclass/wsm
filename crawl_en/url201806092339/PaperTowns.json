Quentin/Colin/Miles is this very thoughtful, somewhat nerdy young man who is on the cusp of fucking reaching out and grabbing life by the balls however he can. He is also enamored with Margo/Alaska/Katherine, a girl who is unattainable. She is unpredictable and full of a shimmering charm; she fades oasis-style the closer and closer you try to get. In addition, she feels too much and is never really seen for who she is (but rather, for who everyone wants her to be). Having said this, I am in love with Quentin/Colin/Miles, and Margo/Alaska/Katherine is the girl I want to meet/aspire to someday be so I can't be too critical. Green knows these people and has lit them from inside with realism and dimension. 2) There were moments (albeit far fewer than in his previous books) where I felt like...okay, this is maybe a teensy bit contrived. A little bit too perfectly quirky. I cannot totally relate or believe in a guy who has invented a mathematical formula calculating the probability that the next Katherine he dates will dump him. I think it's a creative premise that makes me want to read the book and is extremely well-executed, but if I don't believe in someone, I'm not going to fully feel for them or understand them. This prevents me from enjoying the book as much as I do Margaret Atwood, etc. Maybe this doesn't bother anyone else, but it bothers me, and I just can't put the guy up on a pedestal. However, however, I fucking loved this book. And I'm not going to summarize it. It was practically perfect and ridiculously engrossing and extremely fascinating (so much so that my adverb use has increased exponentially). If I even tried to give a synopsis, it would trivialize it too much. Green uses Leaves of Grass in a way that made me want to re-read it (after having suffered through it in high school) and potentially graffiti it all over the United States because: we. have. it. so. wrong. here. (I love Green's use of periods). Part of why I loved it is for selfish reasons. Margo's struggles are my own, and her hates are my hates. In Quentin deciphering Margo, it helped me realize a lot of things about myself; this is something that would be valuable to anyone who needs to become the wounded man."}, {"userName": "Sophia.", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6520961-sophia", "userReview": "Why so many good ratings for this book? It could basically be called Looking for Margo, or Paper Alaska, because it's the same formula, again and again. How many books can he write about an unbelievable teenager secretely loving another unbelievable teenager? Everything was so absurd, Quentin's parents, the road trip, Ben, the black Santas. All the metaphors are perharps what made me lose it completely. The book that Quentin reads, Song of Myself, all the thoughts he had about it are so painfully forced down the reader's throat. I've read somewhere that John Green was in love with his own brain, and I cannot agree more. The rant of the detective about balloons was so badly executed I thought it was a joke. It's not poetic, it's ridiculous. And Quentin is so self absorbed, bashing Ben when really he should take a good look at himself. And Margo. God. I had such a hard time finishing the book.

I first read it years ago; back before I'd heard of vlogbrothers, back when John Green was only known by a handful of readers, way way back before The Fault in Our Stars. And I loved it.\n\u201cIt is so hard to leave\u2014until you leave. And then it is the easiest goddamned thing in the world.\u201d\nThen TFiOS happened and I began to question my feelings for John Green's writing. I know millions loved his tragicomedy about teens with cancer, yet I found it cheesy and contrived, with unrealistic characters who wallowed in their own pretentious philosophy (sorry fans, but that's how I felt). And I began to wonder if perhaps his books had always been like that and I'd somehow missed it. If perhaps Paper Towns wouldn't be the way I remembered it.You see, here's some truths about John Green: He's an intelligent writer. He loves philosophy and he embraces nerddom. And, under it all, he's a romantic. In TFiOS, I believe he took these things too far. It felt like a book that set out with a mission to be deep, clever, to deliver a multitude of messages, to prove that teenagers are quirky and intelligent. Augustus, especially, seemed built around \"intelligence\" and \"quirkiness\" to the point that he didn't feel real; he felt like a caricature of a \"philosophical teen\".But coming back to Paper Towns made me realise that I hadn't changed. JG's style had. Unlike TFiOS, these characters feel real. I felt like I was observing real teens living real lives, even though the plot does contain some fantastical elements. But it's because Quentin and his friends feel like teenagers. Many of them are still smart (it wouldn't be a JG book if they weren't) but they're realistic, silly, horny, and as ridiculous as we all ultimately are.I laughed out loud so many times. I highlighted so many quotes and then couldn't decide which ones to include in my review. I enjoyed the \"depth\" of the novel that emerges gradually behind the silliness. The lessons about teen love and growing up and wanting to escape. In TFiOS, I felt like JG created caricatures. In this book, he takes caricatures and stereotypes and peels back the layers of them to reveal the people underneath. Which is, ultimately, the underlying theme of this book:\n\u201cWhat a treacherous thing to believe that a person is more than a person.\u201d\nYears have passed. People have changed.

I'm kind of perplexed by this book. I know I never want to read the name Margo Roth Spielgelman ever again, that's for sure. The characters (apart from the previously named) were fantastic and very believable. The dialogue between the friends was great and funny as I have come to expect from John Green. The first quarter of the book was highly enjoyable and then it deteriorated for me. I think this book suffers from it's own storyline. *spoilers* It veers from an amusing and interesting start to the baffling obsession of Quentin in his quest to find the will-not-be-named-again girl after they had one night of vengeful fun. I found myself wondering if this was seriously what this book was about after Quentin starts a desperate search for said girl who left home, is 18 (yes a legal adult) and has studiously ignored the crap out of him for 9 years apart from that one night! Not to mention she has her own head firmly stuck up her own arse. What is with all the convoluted clues left for Quentin? Talk about self important! Anyway, I read through it all hoping it all had good reason, but it turns out it was just a giant exercise in navel-gazing.

Last weekend, I attended a company-sponsored teambuilding session and the facilitator used this. I got some good feedbacks that confirmed what I already knew but also some revelations. Those included in the so-called \u201cblindspots\u201d quadrant.In this novel Paper Towns, John Green indirectly used Margo Roth Spiegelman for Quentine Jacobsen or simply Q to understand love and life and to know himself better as a person, as a man. Not by giving him direct feedbacks but by making him experience the things that he would not have dared doing. Who would have dared driving your parents\u2019 car in the middle of the night, pushing it with your friend few meters away from the house so as not to awake them with the sound of the engine? Then going to the houses of the people who wronged your friend just to avenge? Then your friend disappeared, with no intention of returning and not wanting to be found, the following day? Leaving a note after a hug and a kiss: \u201cI. Will. Miss. Hanging. Out. With. You.\u201d That was after leaving catfishes in the underwear drawer of a friend ha ha. Who would have thought of having this plot in the first place? What makes this novel engaging is the prose: it is downright sincere and true to its voice: youngish, quirky, innocent yet full of life lessons. Green does not push down his philosophy on growing up down your throat. He lets you enjoy his story and life realizations just naturally follow. I am sure that Green\u2019s idiosyncrasies must have been reflected somehow by his many male characters: Q, Radar and Ben but Margo permeates in each page of this novel: \n\u201dYes. The fundamental mistake I had always made \u2014 and that she had, in fairness, always led me to make \u2014 was this: Margo was not a miracle. She was not an adventure. She was not a fine and precious thing. She was a girl.\"\n I applaud Green for creating a character like Margo that can rally boys to transform themselves into men without disregard to the pains of growing up. After all, we all went through those pains \u2013 not having a prom date, losing your first love, unrequited love, unknowingly pissing off some of our friends, etc \u2013 and we all learned from them. As we grow old, we tend to ridicule young people experiencing the same pains and call them trivial and proudly say something like you ain\u2019t seen nothing yet! But for them, those are parts of their lives. That\u2019s where we were. That\u2019s where they are now. Like Margo\u2019s paper towns, we need to take care not to blow down the delicate houses and make them fall apart. And yes, even one of my blind spots has just been cleared by this novel. I never thought that a middle-age man like me would still enjoy a YA book.

I realize that this was one of the messages of the book, that we all assign traits and \"personalities\" to people we hardly know, but it was still hard to take, page after page.

Considering she has no troubles at home, there doesn't seem to be a strong enough reason for an eighteen year old to suddenly decide to run away (except that oh, she's oh-so-kooky and larger than life and a small-town girl etc etc.) John Green explains why she does, but I still have trouble accepting it. To me, she only did it because she was self-centred and looking for attention. I didn't feel anything for her character.Q was also really annoying, pining for a girl he barely knows, instead in love with her from the friendship they had as a child, rather than the girl she is today. I'm willing to bet all my money (which is not much) that John Green bases the male protagonist on himself, and that the female character is the type of character he fancied at school, and it sort of plays like he's the dorky, awkward girl in love with the popular, unattainable boy. Q's need to abandon everything to find this girl (who, btw, never showed any sign of affection before their pranks together), is entirely self-indulgent and illogical. And whilst at times he sounded like a teenage boy, other times he sounded a decade or two older.The fact that his friends also decide to follow him on a road-trip to find her doesn't make sense. They do it on graduation day. Why would anyone ditch graduation (which they seemed to look forward to) to find a girl who a) doesn't want to be found and b) they don't even like? Everybody loves a roadtrip, sure. But these are limits. These implausibilities made this book really hard to finish.

Still, we should be always brave enough to meet the real person and accept them for what they are.

We can live the lives that others expected, because if so, we would be ending living other lives than our own. Always a wise advice should be well received, a friendly tip, but at the end, we must forge our own lives, since only us would be guilty of a sad existence or recipents of a happy lifetime.However, we also have in mind that we aren\u2019t islands. Our personal decisions can affect others.

In fact, I think that the movie has a better tempo to tell the events. There are some missing stuff but nothing so relevant. The really important elements in the general story are there. Also, the cast of actress Cara Delevingne was the right one to give life to the very complicated character of \"Margo Roth Spiegelman\". I think that the movie is adequate to tell the same message but giving a better light to the character of Margo Roth Spiegelman that if you don't get what the author wanted to tell in the story, it's quite easy to fall in the road of not liking her. The only sin of the story is not being the clich\u00e9 of all romantic stories and giving a realistic angle."}, {"userName": "Lola  Reviewer", "userReviewDate": "Aug 31, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14596170-lola-reviewer", "userReview": "I can see why there are people out there comparing this with Looking for Alaska.

Isn\u2019t it gorgeous? His prose always succeeds in charming me and I don\u2019t quite consider myself as an easy target\u2026 Lie. I am such an easy target. I am the easiest of targets when it comes to writing style. But still.Margo Roth Spiegelman disappears with clues behind so smart people can track her. Quentin, a smart and bewitched-by-Margo person, makes it his life quest to find the dear disappearing love of his life and, with the help of his friends, Q embarks on an adventure like never before! I make it all sound very dramatic, but the thing is that it IS extremely dramatic for Q and the story overall pretty intense.I thought the clues were fun, although there weren\u2019t that many. I didn\u2019t like that Margo indirectly ruined prom and graduation day for him, although I can only imagine the need to find someone when you think they\u2019re dead. The pacing was a little uneven but here, too, there\u2019s a nuance to be expressed: there was \u2018\u2018action\u2019\u2019 (if I dare call it as such) in the story, there was humor and there was a lot of thinking to be made by Q.I adore this one message (among many others) that I extracted from the story: a girl is just a girl. HA! Margo was first described by Q as a unique, splendid, otherworldly creature, but really, she was just a lost little girl who didn\u2019t know what she wanted, who to be, was relatively tired of living the life she had and just damn liked planning big things and then acting on them (although she liked that a little less, she said so herself).I very much anticipated the denouement\u2026 the moment of revelation\u2026 the ending, because this is the type of story that you know would surprise you with the truth.

Just imagine that, but a guy taking it to another level.So I understand what John Green was trying to do:I love that message, it's great. What I didn't like were the dull characters, especially the main one. He definitely was obsessed with Margo and the way it played out on the pages was annoying. I don't want to hear about how amazing someone is in every single chapter. I didn't even like Margo, she just seemed to think herself as above everyone. In my opinion leaving and letting people think you commit suicide is a pretty indecent thing to do. Even if you think your life is a \u201clie\u201d, have the common decency to tell people you're leaving. This was probably a good demonstration of how we sometimes think of life as a game. It isn't about being the most mysterious or having more adventures than someone else, it's about being authentic. Be who you are and don't expect others to be the same.Another thing I'd like to mention is that there's certainly consequences to just disappearing or breaking in. I don't know if I'd even recommend this to a younger audience since I sincerely wouldn't want anyone taking pointers from Margo. One thing I have to mention is that John Green knows how to write. He can certainly create memorable/inspirational quotes. His characters have never been for me, but the philosophical aspect is always interesting. My only little complaint is that having so many \u201cdeep\u201d quotes/metaphors, can take away.\nHaving a couple really highlights the story and makes you go:\n\nBut having one in every chapter, is more like:\nA quick reminder for anyone and especially young readers, is that wanting to project yourself as something doesn't make you become that. If you desire to make yourself seem like a mystery, it doesn't mean you're a mystery. You're a person and it's wrong for even you to see yourself as something less or more than that. It's amazing to have adventures, it just doesn't define you.Only you can. I've learned that once you stop seeing things the way other people do, you'll learn how to open your eyes to your own perspective.\nOverall thoughts:\nI appreciate the message of the story, just not the plot in general.

It then became difficult for her to remove her coating and be herself. So the only option is to leave it all behind. But there is still one string attached to this papergirl \u2013 Quentin Jacobsen. She wants Q to know her; understand her; love her for who she is inside, no matter how crooked and unreasonable that Margo may be.\n\"The way I figure it, everyone gets a miracle.\u201d\nQ braved the challenge- he took the journey and accepted the would be consequences of it.

He didn't portray them a certain way and then, at the end, abandon that and have them hook up anyway even though it wasn't best. So yes, I'm glad they went their separate ways.

I really don't know what the big deal is about John Green. Sure, The Fault in Our Stars was good but it was hardly a masterpiece and all his other books seem average at best. Why does he get so much love? Is it because he's a guy? I've noticed that most people tend to give men praise and credit even when it's not deserved (whilst the opposite is true for women). I honestly don't think John Green deserves all the fan love and respect he gets \u2014 his books are nothing special.I didn't enjoy Paper Towns all that much. The plot, the characters, the pacing and the writing were all mediocre.Paper Towns was divided into three parts:Part 1: Boring and nerdy Quentin, is surprised when girl next door/girl who he's obsessed with climbs through his window and takes him on an all night adventure around town. Naturally, the girl (Margo) that geeky Quentin's been in love with for years is someone he hasn't talked to since he was a child and someone who just so happens to be beautiful, mysterious and popular. Hmm\u2026 Isn't it every nerdy guy's wish to get the attention of the beautiful girl? Why is it that nerdy, unattractive guys in books/movies/tv always seem to get the pretty girl yet there aren't any plain ugly girls getting the fit guy? Sure, there's the girls who think they're ugly but in actual fact are beautiful that get the fit guy and there's also the plain girl who gets a sexy makeover that gets the guy. But where the hell are the genuinely plain geeky girls that gets the sexy bad boy? Ugh. Double standards, will they ever end?Anyway, Margo wants to get back at her boyfriend and friend for cheating on her. I thought Margo would be some crazy badass but she wasn't. Quentin was even worse than Margo, he was scared about every little thing and Margo had to keep pushing him to loosen up and have some fun. I did like the role reversal \u2014 it's usually the heroine that's cautious and uptight until the hero struts into her life and makes her do crazy things. So yea, points for that. I thought Margo's revenge would be cool but it wasn't \u2014 it was the lamest revenge ever. Part 2: Margo goes missing/runs away. Quentin worries and then worries some more and then keeps worrying. Margo leaves obscure clues to her whereabouts and Quentin becomes obsessed with them. He forces his friends (Ben the loser and Radar the token black guy) to help him find her. So yea, Quentin just goes back and forth visiting different places trying to find his pwecious Margo. In between looking for her, he gets all deep and profound about people and how they act and who they truly are. It read like an 'after school special'.Part 3: Quentin and co miss their graduation and drive a really long way to find Margo. This was the most boring part of the book \u2014 it was just a long journey that involved Ben pissing, Radar being the token black guy, Lacey being the token female, and Quentin being a boring douche. The ending was really anticlimactic\u2026 The whole mystery of Margo was less a mystery and more a mess. Quentin was a dull and charmless character. He only seemed obsessed with Margo because of her beauty and popularity \u2014 it was a very shallow love and that in turn made the whole driving force of the book (Quentin's desire to know/find the real Margo) come across as false and meaningless.Ben was irritating \u2014 especially when he kept calling girls 'hunnybunnies'. I scoffed when he started dating Lacey - it just wasn't believable that someone like Lacey would date a lame loser like Ben.Radar and Lacey were the only likeable characters. Yea, Lacey was a cow at times but she was one of the good cows.Was I meant to care about Margo? 'Oh the poor little popular rich girl has pwoblems'\u2026 Honestly, I didn't care. I could have liked Margo if her problems weren't so lame\u2026 Yea, I'm sure some people would think she had a difficult life but to me she had it easy\u2026 Even with her cheating boyfriend and distant parents she had a pretty great life. All in all, I wasn't impressed. The plot was weak and I couldn't relate to Quentin or his pathetic infatuation with Margo."}, {"userName": "Clair", "userReviewDate": "Aug 01, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3333119-clair", "userReview": "Paper Towns Let's go back to March 2012. I bought The Fault in Our Stars, which had been getting rave reviews, causing me to make a fool of myself in public by jumping up and down in my local bookshop when I discovered I was holding a signed copy. (Don't worry, they're more than used to my behaviour by now.)\u00a0I read it in the space of two days, and promptly had a crying fit so hard that I could have flooded the area where I live. Which is atop a very steep hill. (This sob-fest was unparalleled until I finished Patrick Ness' Chaos Walking trilogy, during which I fell asleep crying, then woke up to find my head resting on a very soggy pillow, and a hollow, empty feeling deep down inside that made me want to have a crying fit all over again.)\u00a0But enough about me blubbering over books. Let's go back to blathering on about them, shall we?In July, I found that my five-county library service stocked three John Green books. Huzzah! I'd just have to wait for them to come in, and slowly wade my way through them as they trickled into my home away from home (and funnily enough, my workplace).\u00a0The first book I received was Will Grayson, Will Grayson, which was a very cute story about two boys who share the same name, and wind up meeting each other, finding love, and putting on a musical. The story itself was quite sincerely told, but it didn't strike the right chord for me, hence why I'd give it 3.5/5 at best.\u00a0Then I moved on to Looking for Alaska about a month later, and this one, I thoroughly enjoyed. It made me think, the love story was quite sweet, and I really loved Alaska as a character. She may have been a bit self-centred, but she was at least fun to read. This one got 5/5.\u00a0Now, for the final one that arrived, wrapped in an old envelope and rubber band with my surname scrawled on it - Paper Towns. I'd heard lots of good things about this novel, and even though I was more aware of John Green's penchant for using Manic Pixie Dream Girls in his books, I thought Alaska was at least done well in Looking For Alaska, as was Augustus (a rare male example) in The Fault in Our Stars. So, let's stop dithering and take a look at Paper Towns.\u00a0It is around this point I should mention that when reading, my mind should not be wandering off and creating a drinking game for the John Green books I have read. The rules will be revealed at the end of this review. Wink wink.\u00a0Paper Towns certainly had me hooked within the first ten pages, which consists of a childhood flashback to our two main characters, Quentin and Margo, discovering a corpse in their local park. We then jump into a time skip (though preferably not the dumpster kind), where Margo and Quentin are at high school. Quentin is a band geek, and Margo flits around the popular kids, but happens to have a touch of eccentricity about her. She runs away from home, plays pranks, and likes leaving riddles whenever she goes off on one of her escapades.\u00a0So, imagine Quentin's confusion when Margo enlists him and the use of his driving skills to play a series of pranks on the kids in the popular crowd. This takes up about... 70 to 80 pages, and it's a genuinely fun read, but where this novel really failed for me, was where Margo was suddenly taken out of the picture. I never quite clicked with Quentin or his friends, and so the investigation portion fell really flat for me.\u00a0Margo also felt a lot like a plot device at certain points, rather than a character with a fleshed out personality. \u201cHey guys, she's gorgeous, eccentric, and has a talent for epic pranks, but now she's missing and we have to search for her, I guess.\u201d Every little new discovery did nothing for me, and I saw the blatant symbolic comparison between Moby Dick and Quentin's search for his own particular white whale way before he went: \u201cOh my god you guys, the pieces just completely clicked together for me just now.\u201d\u00a0It has its funny moments, like in every John Green novel I've read (the line: \u201cBecause nobody can catch the motherfucking fox,\u201d as a character's reason for wearing a fox hat had me in stitches when reading Looking for Alaska), but they were quite sparse.\u00a0So, with all this negativity I have spewed thus far about Paper Towns (and certain other John Green books I didn't enjoy), are there any good parts to Paper Towns? Well, there is that 70 or so page romp through the suburbs, playing pranks that become sillier and sillier as the night draws on, and the ending actually nicely subverts the Manic Pixie Dream Girl trope. Yes, Margo is actually revealed to be not as batty as rumour would have it, and her MPDG-ness is all just embellishments tacked onto her by school friends and Quentin's own delusions about how cool Margo is. It is to that, I truly doff my cap. It's also nice how it ended up relating to the title, even if the literal explanations of 'paper towns'/'copyright traps' (the idea that cartographers would add fake towns onto their maps so they'd know if another mapmaker had copied them) was rather weak.\u00a0I also found that the author did accurately capture post-exam, between high school/college and university anxiety, especially when Margo essentially dresses down the whole concept of going to school so you can go to university so you can have a good job so you have support having children or a lavish lifestyle so you can retire and pass on your legacy. Margo thankfully became more likeable towards the end.\u00a0Although the second act of the novel would sometimes trudge through the investigation into Margo's disappearance like a tortoise with wads of chewed up bubblegum on its feet, the ending does have a satisfying pay-off, and I would implore readers to give it a chance beyond the \u201cugh, god, another John Green novel with a Manic Pixie Dream Girl and a boring male lead.\u201d 3.5/5.\u00a0Now, as promised, here is the patented John Green drinking game. ;)TAKE A DRINK/SHOT/SIP/WHICHEVER YOU PREFER EVERY TIME...\u00a01. The words 'bro', 'awesome', 'dude', or Internet vernacular come up.\u00a02. There is a reference to classical literature or poetry.\u00a03. The Manic Pixie Dream Girl/Boy does something, well, manic. (Bonus sip if the characters figure out s/he has left clues after his/her disappearance.)\u00a04. Indie bands, whether real or made up for the novel, are referenced.\u00a05. Not just indie bands, actually \u2013 any kind of older music.\u00a06. The Manic Pixie Dream Girl/Boy isn't actually around for much of the novel, but his/her presence is felt by the characters even after s/he's gone.\u00a07. Our main character is an awkward teenage boy.\u00a08. Our main character is a miserable teenage boy.\u00a09. Our main character's friends are also dumb teenage boys, one of whom is a regular Casanova, and the other is a support crutch.\u00a010. Instant messaging is used.\u00a011. Things are listed like this: a) I was awkward, b) she was beautiful and clever and smart and funny, c) I had no chance in hell with her, d) she was probably going out with somebody else, even if she thought s/he was too mainstream for her.\u00a0(Also, the drinking game is always open to suggestion. Have fun, though I am in no way liable for any alcohol-related injuries or illnesses if you so choose to play this drinking game whilst reading all of John Green's novels in one go. Just saying.)"}, {"userName": "Etnik", "userReviewDate": "Aug 30, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34369915-etnik", "userReview": "This book as the others by this author has the John Green theme:1.Awkward funny charismatic good looking fit main character who somehow is a looser.2.The hot popular girl who he is forever in love.3.A weird funny bestfriend who gets in trouble.4.Prom.5.Everything happening in the last 2 weeks of high school.6.Quotes that every teenage tumblr girl has in their blog description.7.Road trip8.Some meaningful ending when you re-think all your teenage years and wish that this would have happened to you."}, {"userName": "Kai", "userReviewDate": "Apr 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41788524-kai", "userReview": "\u201cIf you don't imagine, nothing ever happens at all.\u201d A Disappointment You know, it started promising.

So I'm driving.\"a) as we find out shortly, the cost of driving to Upstate New York from Orlando, Florida is pretty expensive. Gas aint cheap, and neither are the provisions needed to make the journey in one almost non-stop run. A plane ticket would probably be cheaper, I mean it's fucking Orlando there are always cheap flights to and from the Magic Kingdom. b) a town just outside of Woodstock is at most two and a half hours, but more likely two hours from NYC (depending on how far off the Thruway it is). A flight to Albany though, and then driving from Albany to Woodstock is about an hour. Eight hours from New York City heading North would put Margo's location somewhere about fifty miles North of Montreal, or by the New York Thruway out somewhere near Binghamton or Rochester. Q could have easily flown, although I don't know how an 18 year old would have rented a car. That would have been the problem, not the distance of Woodstock from New York City.

He writes Young Adult novels (Looking for Alaska [wherein \"Alaska\" is a girl's name], An Abundance of Katherines, to name a couple) and is both a popular and critical success. This is the first of his books that I've read, and I wish now that I'd started with one of his earlier ones.In a nutshell, this novel bored me. If I were a teenager (the novel's primary audience) reading this book, it's doubtful that I would have finished it. Green failed to make me care.There were some interesting ideas sprinkled throughout (not that many of them, though), and some of the dialogue was entertaining (very much soon-to-be-dated teenspeak, as is often the case in YA lit), but I only actually liked one of the characters--Radar--and he wasn't the protagonist. Ouch.Mr. Green just didn't tell much of a story here, nor did he do any of the things that make me forgive a lack of story (experimenting with form; relating incredibly real characters, either likeable or not; achieving transcendent language/description; getting across startling or important ideas--none of these).I will, out of a sense of professional duty and based on the recommendations of people I trust, try one more of John Green's books--probably Looking for Alaska.
