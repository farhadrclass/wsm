Just as we adorn sex with the fancy gold-leaf filigree of love, so we dress the need for sustenance in the finery of cooking and connoisseurship\u2026Yes, men and women eat meals. But they also ingest nutrients. They grind and sculpt them into a moistened bolus that is delivered via a stadium wave of sequential contractions, into a self-kneading sack of hydrochloric acid and then dumped into a tubular leach field, where is it converted into the most powerful taboo in human history. [no, not wearing white after Labor Day] \nIf I had my own university I would see to it that Mary Roach received an honorary doctorate in Scatology. She does seem to have a predilection for investigating elements of human functions that would be considered indelicate in polite company. Of course, to my not-so-inner-Beavis, this is mother\u2019s milk. (Oh, god, no. Is she going to look into that next?) So far, Ms. Roach, a science writer, has managed to process information and squeeze out books on dead bodies (Stiff), the afterlife (Spook: Science Tackles the Afterlife ), some of the more personal elements of space travel (Packing for Mars) and sex (Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex). In Gulp, Ms. Roach looks into the details of how, during our corporal existence, we fuel the engines that allow us to scoot between planets or partners, and which make it possible to contemplate what should be done with our remains. Mary takes us on a lively cruise down the alimentary canal, which lies somewhere between Love Canal and Root Canal, but with more jokes. Really though, a canal is what we are. Stuff in, stuff out, and an increasingly complex control mechanism to make sure it keep flowing. Philosophy? Religion? Civilization? Whatever. Feed me. Let me poop and pee and the rest is gravy. Because, you know, if you can\u2019t or don\u2019t eat, everything else is moot. (Insert anorexic model joke here) If you can\u2019t get rid of the final product, everything else is really nastily moot. So, while our trip with Captain Mary may lack the derring do of the good ship Proteus, (and the wooden leg of that other well-known cruise) it is a fantastic journey from here to there, and most definitely not back again. As with any sightseeing outing, your tour guide will point out the structures along the way that are considered to be of interest. All ahead full and pay no attention to those white particles dangling from the tree roots along the side. We begin our look inside by examining how smell affects the way things taste to us. If you smell a rat, it might be because of its diet, of which more later. Our first stop is the nose, along with our sense of smell, which functions as the body\u2019s TSA, with its own list of items that may not be brought aboard.Hold on for a bit as the captain steers the boat into an unexpected cul-de-sac. While there, you will pick up some info on the food you get for your cats and dogs. Ok, backing out and here we are, looking at the appetite for organ meat in various places and cultures, what is good about it and how many of us consider it nasty. It is in this chapter that we discover that Narwhal skin turns out to be rather tasty. Around the bend and down the hatch, Ms. Roach spends some time pondering the question of whether, like one jaw-weary fellow in 1903, we might believe that by chewing one\u2019s food very, very thoroughly, one can gain greater nutrition from it than someone could by chewing it a more typical number of times. And while you are mulling that over, Roach goes poking into the strange case of Dr. William Beaumont, the researcher, and Alexis St Martin, his personal guinea pig, the proud possessor of an ill-healed and surprisingly non-fatal gunshot wound to the torso. It scarred up oddly and left the enterprising Doctor Beaumont direct access to Mister St Martin\u2019s stomach. Let the testing begin, and go on and go on. Hey, come back here. I\u2019m not done. For a feature length look at this, up that tributary on the left, you might poke your nose into Open Wound: The Tragic Obsession of Dr. William Beaumont by Jason Karlawish. Next, Captain Mary points out the surprising relationship between spit and laundry detergent, actually between spit (there are two kinds, neither of which is called warm) and a lot of things, and why we like our foods to be crispy and crunchy. And if you were wondering if this little excursion included the risk of being devoured by large living creatures, Roach can fill you in on the odds of surviving inside a leviathan\u2019s stomach.From Heidelblog.netThere are plenty more sights to be seen on this journey, subjects like ways of eating oneself to death, the explosive danger of intestinal gas,(\u201cI know a case, this was fifteen years ago, where the man ate a huge meal and then took an inordinate amount of Alka-Seltzer.\u201d [Dyspepsia expert Mike] Jones made an exploding sound into the telephone. It was like that Monty Python sketch, the Wafer-Thin Mint, where the guy is gorging himself and finally he goes, \u201cI\u2019ll just have this one wafer-thin mint\u2026\u2019\u201d)From GIPHY.COMand the booming field of flatulence.From Flixter.com(I bet you thought I was gonna go with the infamous bean scene from Blazing Saddles. I am much too classy for that. You will have to go there on your own. Just click this.)And did you know that it was not only possible to ignite farts, but that there are some people who have flammable belches? Roach gets to the bottom of the practice known as keistering, and hooping. Prison is a likely lab for such research into the use of the rectum as a cargo hold. The storage capacity is impressive, to the point that one inmate was referred to as OD for Office Depot, for his hooping capacity, actually used for keistering office supplies. I\u2019m not using that stapler. And you will be amazed at how much of a rat\u2019s diet consists of material that\u2026um\u2026emerged from the rat. So on spotting a certain rodent in Orlando, try to stop yourself from asking what it is in that taco he is toting. And you do not want to be downwind of that breath.The colon comes in for considerable examination, and figures in a surprising theory for the cause of death of a king. She comes clean in a look at the history, reasons for and abuses of enemas. And, of course Mary lets loose when she gets the scoop on pooping. She even notes a chart that delineates the seven different types. You know you want to see it. Bristol Stool ChartOk. Time to squeeze yourself off the boat. Be sure to tip the guide. Roach always delights in reporting on names that are particularly apt.my gastroenterologist is Dr. Terdiman, and the author of the journal article \u201cGastrointestinal Gas\u201d is J. Fardy, and the headquarters of the International Academy of Proctology was Flushing, New York.I suppose the academy might be better off in Richmond, VA, in the neighborhood called Shockoe Bottom, or maybe in Proberta, CA.A couple of minor gripes. This book could really have used an index. And the chapter on feeding Spot and Fluffy, while interesting, seemed a bit of a digression from the main journey.That said, reading Mary Roach is akin to the pure joy one experiences from things like Ripley\u2019s Believe It or Not, with the benefit of knowing that there is no smoke and mirror involvement. Reality is soooooo weird. And we have Mary Roach to thank for refilling our occasionally dwindling mental storehouse of disturbing images, (You will never think of Elvis quite the same way after reading this book) and fascinating scientific facts, like the possible origin for the belief in fire-breathing dragons or the medical efficacy of fecal transplants.There is never a doubt that Mary Roach will make you laugh and teach you things you never knew before. What could be better? Ok, I mean aside from the Blazing Saddles clip. ==============================EXTRA STUFFHere is the full vid of the wafer thin mint bit, aka  Mr. Creosote. Don\u2019t even try watching this if you get queasy easily. It requires a very strong stomach or a very weak mind. The May 2013 issue of Smithsonian Magazine features an article by Roach,  The-Gut-Wrenching-Science Behind the World\u2019s Hottest Peppers and there is another piece in that issue that may be of interest, Why You Like What You Like by Tom Vanderbilt.

I'm left with the feeling that lies somewhere between TMI, an author's perverse, small-boy like joy in slightly shocking the adults by talking about farts and turds, and actually being interested in the transformation from a Michelin chef plate of food into, moments later, a disgusting saliva-covered bolus no one even wants to look at. The book is punctuated with many small revelations that won't change my life in any way but are good to drop into a conversation for that OMG moment on someone else's face. Like, Elvis Presley died of constipation, the straining of which brought on a fatal heart attack. Poor man had been constipated all his life and never travelled without his Fleet and laxatives. Judy Garland and Lenny Bruce also died on the loo, but more mundanely (for celebrities) of drugs. Catherine the Great also died on the toilet in one version of her final exit. In the other she was crushed by the horse she was shagging. This isn't in the book btw. Just trivia I picked up along the way.If you prefer to think that all that goes on beneath your skin should remain shrouded in a little mystery and want that aforementioned Michelin chef plate of food to remain in your mind as an artfully-decorated dish of delicate flavours, then don't read the book. Because it's not about the plate of food but the turd that comes out the end incorporating spit, bitter green bile and the slime of mucus and how it got that way. If you don't want to know all about that, then don't read the book. You won't enjoy it.

Roach truly is the funniest, best science writer I've ever had the pleasure to read. Her inquisitive mind doesn't always follow a linear path & the side tracks are illuminating.--------------\"While a seaman might survive the suction and swallow, his arrival in a sperm whale's stomach would seem to present a new set of problems.\"*[footnote]*I challenge you to find a more innocuous sentence containing the words sperm, suction, swallow, and any homophone of seaman. And then call me up on the homophone and read it to me.- Mary Roach in Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary CanalJonah got swallowed by a big fish? The above quote is in the part of the book discussing that. The good news is that whales have a fore stomach with no digestive juices. The bad news is that it is like a gizzard on some birds & crushes the food into manageable sizes. Sharks will also swallow prey whole, but their stomachs do have digestive juices & they do digest living prey as three sea turtles found out to their detriment. ---------Yes, much of the book was about gross stuff, but it was seriously interesting. We're basically an evolved digestive system. The alimentary canal is the core of the man-beast. It creates our energy & all the rest of the body is simply a way to spread the wealth & get a return investment to feed it more efficiently. We rely on (live for?) our gut & the sales pitch we're subjected to daily is full of misinformation & outright lies. You think I go too far? The first third of the book is devoted to what we eat & why. Smell & taste are not processed by the frontal lobes of our brain. Did you know that people who lose their sense of taste & smell can actually starve to death because they can't swallow? It's that important. Our body's sensors can get screwed up & we can develop bad habits, but it's often good to give in to a craving. I never thought much of food restrictions & never subscribed to any fad diets, thankfully. I always try to eat a fairly balanced diet of what I want & apparently that's pretty much a good thing since everything is working well & I've been the same weight since I was 20. Maybe liver tastes yucky to me because I shouldn't eat it. Yeah, I'm going with that.Why do some diets work for some people & not for others? Apparently, each gut is as unique as a fingerprint. By the amount & types of bacteria in it, your family could be traced since Momma seeds yours. What you digest & how is also covered to some extent. This isn't a dietary book, though. There are no clear cut answers to the individual, but there is a lot of overall knowledge.I never knew how much misinformation was floating about. The chewing fad of the early 1900's was disproved a century or more (Roach gives dates, I just have a bad memory.) before it was suggested & even implemented in some cases by our government, basically at the behest of a well connected con man. But that's just one of many cases she discusses throughout the book. Many are still in play today.The stomach is amazingly ductile, but people can blow it up. Interestingly enough, it's never happened to a competitive eater. There are several sections devoted to this wondrous organ & its abilities. Really interesting chapters devoted to comparing what it can digest & how fast it moves food along, too.The small intestine gathers most of good stuff out of what we swallow and the colon gets a little more plus the water, but it does some important digestion of its own. I was a little disappointed that there wasn't anything about the gall bladder, but my wife's problems with that organ taught us that it isn't considered part of the digestive system, even though bile is very important in the process. Be warned. Your stomach doctor might scope you through both ends, but they don't do gall bladders at all. It's like the step child of the digestive system. They just tell you to take Maalox & ignore it after that.She also explores the similarities & differences between our digestive system & that of herbivores a bit. I didn't know that rats & rabbits processed their food for many vitamins in their colon (B's & K). Process, but not absorb. Whoops! This is why they HAVE to eat their own poop. (Bunnies suddenly aren't nearly as cute, are they?) They're severely stunted if diapered. More illuminating are the comparisons between us, gorillas (vegetarians) & monkeys.Probiotics? The overwhelming majority are just marketing. The bacteria you need most are anaerobic (can't live in an oxygen environment) so you won't find them in a yogurt cup nor will they survive the trip through the stomach. There is a way to restore them, but neither the insurance nor pharmaceutical companies are happy with it. You probably won't be either, unless you're suffering from severe colon problems & changing your own diapers a dozen times a day. Two words: Fecal Transplant. It often works, too. There are a couple of chapters devoted to farts. Gross! Yeah, but figuring out what makes them stop smelling would sure be nice, wouldn't it? I've been in a couple of elevators that I barely made it out of with my lunch intact. So some people study them, even make synthetic farts. Eating charcoal doesn't help - it's absorbancy is used up way before it gets to the colon where the smelly gases are generated. So just how do they deodorize them? Well, Beano DOES help with beans, but they've worked out some other ways, too. Unfortunately, no one will read about them in normal magazine ads. Those publications say the yuck factor is too strong. You can find out about them in this book, though.There's another quote in the book about the anus being a marvel of engineering beyond man's technical ability in that it is able to handle gas, liquids, & solids on command with aplomb. (Usually, hopefully!) So calling someone an asshole is really talking them up!This has gotten way too long, sorry. It's fascinating & I only touched a few of the high points. There's a lot of excellent knowledge here & only Roach's delicate touch could make it so readable, even at lunch time, about the only time I have to read during the spring.I'd also like to tip my hat to Ed, Mary's husband. You're a lucky man, but you must have a great sense of humor & the hide of a rhino. Seriously, she explores whether or not he can kill her in the night with beer farts if she sleeps with her head under the covers! That's almost as bad as his trip to England in Bonk: The Curious Coupling of Science and Sex where he got to spoon with Mary while a doctor used a sonogram to see how things fit together during coitus. Ed, you're a better man than I!;-)"}, {"userName": "Jim", "userReviewDate": "Aug 25, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1460921-jim", "userReview": "I'm considering giving up on this book even though the topic is interesting. If only Mary Roach could restrain herself from quite so much levity. The jokes, asides, and snarky personal observations come on strong. They're constant, unrelenting, (somehwhat geeky humor) and are a distraction from otherwise fascinating material.Her research is impressive and I appreciate her trying to make it not dry and clinical, but she goes overboard. Why do I care how pretty the scientists are, what they're wearing, or how the room is furnished? She has a rambling style and includes lots of irrelevant details, along with puns, apologies for the puns, and so many little wink-wink, nudge-nudge passages that it verges on dumbing down. It's kind of like those PBS science shows about the complexities of the universe or time travel - or a Michael Moore documentary - where they incoporate lots of cartoons, sound effects, and nerdy jokes to lighten it up and make it more accessible to teens.

After scanning all the usual places in the store, I finally asked an associate to direct me to the new book, only to have her type and study her screen, then point vaguely into a back corner of the store and dismiss me. At this point, it was a mission. Minutes later, I was back at the now-empty workstation, so I peered at her screen and saw that indeed there were supposed to be five copies of this invisible book somewhere in the store. I revisited all the tables and shelves again before finally giving up and finding a different employee. Lucky for me, this person noted that I'd been in the store wandering around for about 30 minutes and joined me in my hunt. The book was released that day, and the trusted computer insisted that there were five copies somewhere. She got her manager and after much deliberation they polled yet another employee who didn't recall seeing the books either.

Though the book was a little graphic at times, I learned a lot about the human body that I didn\u2019t know before. The structure of the book was easy to follow when listening, and the information was presented in a clear and humorous way. Another reason I enjoyed this book was because my husband and I could listen to it together: for the first time ever, he had asked me to turn on an audiobook when we got in the car!

Warning: Possible side effects of reading this book include forcing your loved ones (aka the husband, in my case) to listen to about a bajillion facts about pooping, burps, farts, and gas.

Roach again writes about a somewhat squeamish, gross-ish, yucky topic that you didn't know you were interested in until she made you realize the subject matter is interesting. Examples: 1) Did you know that most laundry detergents contain at least 3 digestive enzymes found in your saliva, to help break down food and grease stains on your clothes? Roach even goes as far as asking the experts why we can't just rub our saliva on stains to help get them out? (Answer: even the detergent scientists think that's gross and would rather use a Tide stain stick). Same goes with dish detergent; saliva enzymes are at work. 2) Roach interviews Elvis Presley's personal doctor. Did you know Elvis' colon was 2-3x the normal size? I won't spoil it here, but for you Elvis fans, a plausible and probable cause of his death is discussed between the author and his physician. Very interesting. 3) Perhaps the most intriguing (yet disgusting) thing Roach researches is the the study of fecal transplants to help those with diseases such as Crohn's and diverticulitis. I know your cringing if you're reading this but studies have found many patients are benefiting from this. Problem is it takes years to get approved. Roach predicts in 10 years that it will be common to know someone who has undergone a body fluid transplant of some sort to treat a disease.This was a fun and fairly quick audiobook that was narrated by Emily Woo Zeller. She was did a good job. I love science and medicine and recommend this book to those of you who enjoy these topics, too. Roach's eccentric and humorous wit and research style definitely has me hooked. I look forward to reading the few other books she has written as well. 4 stars."}, {"userName": "Carol.

It\u2019s astonishing, really, those primitive forms of waterborne life, and it emphasizes an interesting thing about animal anatomy, that we aren\u2019t a solid, discrete, bounded organism: the environment moves through us as much as it moves around us. We like to think of \u201cinside\u201d and \u201coutside\u201d our bodies when in fact, it\u2019s much more complicated. Those familiar with the gastrointestinal system (\u201cthe GI tract\u201d in medical slang) understand that as a system rather continuous with the \u201coutside,\u201d it is one of the least sterile parts of our anatomy (the case could probably be made for skin as well). Perhaps that is why there are so many taboos surrounding what we eat, how we eat, vomiting, farting, defecation and such\u2013all those different ways we interact with our environment. Gulp. Adventures on the Alimentary Canal explores the GI tract and its unmentionables in an engaging way that is somewhat limited by basic scholarship.*******************************************Further criticisms at:http://clsiewert.wordpress.com/2014/0...andhttp://carols.booklikes.com/post/8590...-"}, {"userName": "Erica", "userReviewDate": "Feb 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2644090-erica", "userReview": "You know what would be amazing (or potentially disastrous)? A Mary Roach/Mark Kurlansky collaboration, preferably on some obscure topic. Can you imagine? The depth, breadth, and width of their topic would be so fully explored, we'd all be experts on the subject by the end of their book.I love Roach's passion for whatever she's researching. She goes down rabbit holes and gets excited to try to tie her findings in with her main thesis, sometimes with success, usually without. Example: While researching why organ meat went out of vogue and then tried to make a comeback during WWII, she found some pledges about eating organ meat for patriotism. That segued into a discussion on the popularity of pledges up through the \u201850\u2019s which then went into the scarcity of menfolk during the war and suggestions in domestic engineering magazines that suggested making baby clothes from old adult clothing. Regardless, the end result is entertaining and informative. Even better, she writes conversationally, like she's at a party, relating her experiences to an interested audience, making her topic easy and fun to understand. That's sort of how this review will be structured, less as a review and more of me spouting things I enjoyed and learned.I didn't learn quite as much from this book as I did from Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers because for reasons unknown to me, I'd already encountered a lot of the information in this one. However, that's not to say I didn't learn anything; at least 50% of the tales herein were news to me!She starts this book with the assertion she wants readers to say, \u201cI thought this would be gross but it\u2019s really interesting.\u201dI didn\u2019t think it was going to be gross. I love the journey of food from the ground to the sewage treatment plant. I find our ingestion and digestion systems to be endlessly fascinating. One of my favorite topics of conversation is poop and I am always thrilled when I run across others who feel the same. Gabe is not one of those people, by the way. In fact, he hates it when I read books like this and he specifically hated this one because of the END. Ha ha ha! I mean because the last part of the book was all about the colon and getting waste out of the body...by means of THE END! Ha ha ha!Roach starts at the top, with the nose. I actually learned about smell being taste when my dad lost his sense of smell, thus, most of his tastery, in a plane crash. There have been some amusing stunts pulled at Christmas dinners focused on his inability to smell and, thus, taste. Throughout this part, I got to be all smug and stuff, telling myself, \"Yes, yes. I know this! Ha ha! I am very smart.\"But I want to argue about cats and their taste buds. She posits: Cats are more or less monoguesic meaning they stick to one food. Outdoor cats tend to be either mousers or birders, not both. - I don\u2019t think this is true, based solely on anecdotal evidence to the contrary. I know and have known cats who like just one type of prey but I've known just as many who like multiple types of prey. And then there's Evie who thinks blood is gross so she brings me all her prey, still alive and freaked out. There's a lot of catch-and-release that goes on in my house.Roach also says: Cats, unlike dogs and other omnivores, can\u2019t taste sweetness Except Toki. He has a terrible sweet tooth. If it's sweet, he wants to eat it. His favorite sweet treat is anything lemon-flavored. He doesn't like lemon on its own or on chicken or on vegetables but if there's lemon frosting, lemon cake, lemon cookies (he thinks the lemon Girl Scout cookies are the best), lemon filling, lemon ice-cream, anything that's lemon+sugar, processed or home-made, he wants it and we fight.I clearly need to become a scientist of cats' food habits because I have research that needs doing and theories that need disproving.Here's a truth I have proven to myself time and again: Research has shown that if people try something enough times, they\u2019ll probably grow to like it. That\u2019s why I like kimchee, retsina, and bitter tea. However, it doesn't always work. I still don\u2019t like beets, coffee*, liver, or lima beans.*except coffee with chicory. Something about the chicory dampens the coffee taste.Also, if I have to drink coffee, I make sure it\u2019s 1 part coffee, one part milk, one part sugar, and alcohol if I can get it. I really do not like the taste of coffee, despite trying it regularly.Now we\u2019re talking about spit! This is so fun.Spit enzymes are used in detergents and in art restoration.She missed a golden opportunity here, though. She never discussed mothers spitting onto tissues/their fingers/handkerchiefs/whatever and then applying said spit to a child's face. I'm pretty sure there should have been, at least, a paragraph devoted to the practice.Roach says it\u2019s socially unacceptable to taste your own spit, as in spit it out and then drink it on purpose. I remember doing that as a kid, though, because I wanted to know if my spit tasted like something. See? I've been doing this alimentary canal stuff all my life!Fat is the main carrier of flavor - hmmm. Now it makes sense why fat is so appealing and why we use oil. I love this! I love how everything is linking together!Human bites aren\u2019t as detrimental as rumored when you bite other humans. However \u201cFight Bites,\u201d knuckle contusions brought about by socking someone in the mouth, do get infected not because of spit but because hands don\u2019t get a lot of blood flow so the immune system has a harder time delivering healing stuff to that area. Ditto ear cartilage. Also, fight bites can lead to arthritis. Note to self: Don't punch people in the mouth unless there's hand protection involved.There\u2019s a whole section on why crispy, crunchy food is satisfying. We associate crunch with fresh, like apples and carrots. Mushy fruits and veggies mean they\u2019re rotting and rotting foods make us sick so we don\u2019t like mushy stuff.I don\u2019t know if I agree with this, though. I think there needs to be more research into this area. I'm not going to be the one to do it, though. I'm going to assign this to my BFF, Tina. Her love of crispy, crunchy food is ridiculous and I think she needs to find out from whence stems this obsession.I think we're skipping the esophagus. If there was more than a mere mention, beyond choking hazards, I missed it, which is a shame because the esophagus is a weird animal and more people should know about it.We're onto the stomach now! Digestion central!Ooh, I feel so smug knowing about hydrochloric acid. I used to use it for tanning leather. It\u2019s much less corrosive than other acids, but man it smells weird, super gross when it's on your skin. Did you know that if you don't have a vat of hydrochloric acid handy, you can use human female pee? Human female pee has a higher concentration of ammonia and...something else so can also be used to make leather. I never did that because I didn't feel like peeing in a vat. I didn't learn that from this book, I learned that when I learned to tan hides and, before that, in second grade when we learned about American Indians and how they stuffed animal skins into tree stumps that were filled with rotty tree stump water OR how they peed on the hides in order to cure them.I am a bit alarmed at the amount of fistulated animal stomachs in this book, humans' included.Just like The Bloggess, Roach had to put a full-length arm glove on and stick said arm into a cow. Roach put her arm into the rumen of the cow, though, instead of its vagina, via a fistula with a window. Still, how many books have you read recently that had someone gloving-up and then going shoulder-deep into a cow? Wait. I don't think I want to know the answer to that.And now we're going for the gut! Intestines!OMG! Your butt can blow up badly enough to kill you! That\u2019s awful! A French dude blew up during a colonoscopy.Bwahahahaha = As anyone who has typed pyroflatulence into YouTube search is aware\u2026 Wait, let\u2019s do that and see the results. Here you go!Finally, we get to the poop of the matter. Pee, too, of course, but poop is more fascinating. For instance, there was a dude who felt putting a warm kitten on your stomach would help break up constipation. I think this is probably the reason but she says nothing has been proven one way or another and that, more than likely, a warm kitten snoring on your stomach is relaxing and you can finally stop clenching so hard and let the poop flow.THE END.No, seriously, though, I had so much fun with this book. I'm going to listen to all her works. And then I'm going to marry her so I can take her to parties and she can do all the talking and I just have to listen and not be involved.And I really do want her to write something with Kurlansky because OMG, that info dump!"}, {"userName": "The Captain", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/54489623-the-captain", "userReview": "Ahoy there me mateys!

Maybe you think that's gross, and if so, to you I say THIS.*Seriously, if you're not going to read the whole book, at least read that chapter. She includes a transcript where astronauts see one of their turds floating around, and they're all, 'It's not mine!' 'Mine was more gooey!' 'Mine looked like a snake!' or something like that. It's amazing.I did indeed learn way more about pooping (and not pooping) in Gulp than I had bargained for. I also learned about saliva and parasites and exploding stomachs and how smelling is more important to eating than tasting and how Elvis was really killed by his colon (Roach has great personal interviews with experts that accompany each of these things, including one with Elvis' doctor). Also: how some people think the dragon myth was started because of cavemen kicking snake corpses close to a fire, which might have caused the explosion of other dead animals being digested inside the snake, releasing a gas that then burst into flames out of the snake's mouth (this was in one of the chapters about the science of farting -- yes there is more than one). Also also: poop transplants are a real thing.Actually, I want to talk about that poop transplant thing some more because I think it's the perfect example of what Mary Roach is all about. Poop transplanting -- or as it's known in the medical community, fecal transplantation -- is actually a really beneficial procedure, although it sounds majorly disgusting. The human colon is a veritable colony of bacteria, most of it beneficial to our digestion and immune systems. When that balance is upset by something, like a large dose of antibiotics for example, or if a person is born without certain bacteria (fun fact: babies get most of their bacteria from their mother at birth) diseases or disorders can result. The example she uses is the common bacteria c. diff, which in the case of the patient she observes, has taken over his colon due to an absence of other more important bacterias. Poor guy's had basically nothing but diarrhea for YEARS. But after his fecal transplant? The proper ratio of bacteria is re-established and his digestive problems are cured in a matter of days. And yet, as Roach is careful to note, the medical community does not take this procedure seriously, in large part due to the taboo surrounding its subject matter. No insurance company yet recognizes the treatment as valid, and it's extremely hard for doctors and scientists to get funding. Also a factor is that drug companies do not enjoy the idea of a procedure that does not involve drugs, and that in fact, removes the possibility entirely that drugs will be needed by patients in the future. But Mary Roach loves this stuff, the stuff nobody wants to think about, and she loves the people who spend their lives asking questions and doing weird experiments just like this one, because she understands that we need people like the guy who invented poop transplants to think outside the box. If they're not doing it, who the hell will?I suppose it will be another two years before we get the next Mary Roach book, but I'm willing to wait if she's willing to keep writing books like this one."}, {"userName": "Jsavett1", "userReviewDate": "Apr 12, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1289730-jsavett1", "userReview": "I'm a big fan of Mary Roach's books, and that said, this is her best. I'll admit straight off that this opinion is deeply influenced by the very fact of my chronic inflammatory bowel disease; for one thing, I am well beyond the squeamishness and taboos that this subject matter may induce or cross. Digestion, food's long journey through the bowel, and the composition and frequency of \"release\" are very conscious parts of my daily life. To read Roach approach such familiar and usually off limits subject matter with her characteristic wit and charm was incredibly refreshing. And boy, is Roach funny in this book. Whether it's reading one of her many amazingly interesting and clever footnotes, or just chuckling at Roach's INCREDIBLE luck at continuously finding doctors and specialists whose last names seem to DESTINE them for work in digestion, this book is a joy to read at every turn.Finally, just a short encomium for Roach. I love reading her books because she's a good writer of course; but what MAKES her a good writer is her endless curiosity for and awe of the world around us. She is the very best kind of intellectual because there is a naked honesty in her curious searching. And her findings are never twisted or pruned to fit an a priori ideology---rather, we get what she gets when she asks the questions we're all praying she will, the ones we'd love to have the guts to ask.

Even her more conventional works flirt with taboo, and in Gulp she embraces disgust whole-heartedly, by treating readers with iron stomachs to a discussion of all things digestive. Gulp is not, strictly speaking, a book about the digestive system. Instead, it's a history of the odder means scientists through the centuries have fashioned to study it, though some of the questions themselves are startling enough (how many cellphones can you pack into a rectum?) Its intent is more entertaining than educational, but readers will glean an understanding of how our body works regardless, and perhaps learn more than they wished they knew. The body's own structure gives Roach an organizational structure her other books might lack: her record of experiments follows the 'alimentary canal', an older name for the digestive tract, from our tongue right through the intestines and out the other side, pausing for a great many fart jokes. Roach is definitely a 'popular' science writer in that she writes for the lowest common denominator, appealing to as many readers as can be possibly found who are willing to read about spit and constipation. This is not a work that takes itself seriously; it is disgusting, funny, and informative in that order. Largely entertaining, but a touch on the gratuitous side."}, {"userName": "Lena", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/220791-lena", "userReview": "Mary Roach's latest book examines what happens to food from the time we put it in our mouths to the time it comes out the other end. It contains all the elements of her trademark style - cheeky humor, a gung-ho attitude towards the disgusting, and actual quality science.There were many sections of this book I found genuinely fascinating. Her initial chapters about the elements of taste - both human and pet - got me hooked and wanting to read more, and her closing chapters about maladies of the colon (including what REALLY killed Elvis), the century-old scam of colonic irrigation, and the astonishingly high success rates of fecal transplants contain much useful information. In between, I marveled at the ability (albeit rare) of some humans to eat themselves to death and enjoyed the scientific dissection of the claims of those who assert Jonah-like survival of whale (or python or frog) swallowing.I must confess, however, that this book revealed to me that I am extraordinarily squeamish when it comes to discussions of certain aspects of the digestive system, in particular, stomach acid. This not so much a problem for me when such acid is contained to the stomach itself, as nature designed, but a not insignificant part of this book is dedicated to experiments in which these internal fluids are accessed from the outside of still living creatures, including a French-Canadian trapper who had the misfortune of being shot in the side and then treated by a doctor who saw his wound as an excellent opportunity to promote the advancement of medical knowledge. I'm not sure what it is about this subject (as well as disturbingly in-depth discussions of saliva) that caused me such consternation, but it did make the book somewhat harder to read, particularly since what little reading time I have these days coincides with the taking of my own meals. Given how many bodily taboos this book dives merrily into, I would not recommend the reading-while-eating strategy if you tend towards the squeamish yourself. Aside from that, however, if you like Mary Roach, you'll find plenty of good stuff to digest (ha!) here."}, {"userName": "Daniel Chaikin", "userReviewDate": "Nov 25, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18695911-daniel-chaikin", "userReview": "Gulp is Roach's 5th major non-fiction book and I think that colors a lot of its character. It feels very casual, and to a large extent Roach is simply having fun in her own way. She follows the topics that interest her, the ones that lead to some of the oddest places. That means as a reader you will be entertained (a word that has a one-off shade of meaning here), but if it changes your life in anyway, its purely accidental. You won't come away with a feeling that you now know the digestive system. Instead you'll feel terrible for Elvis Presley, fascinated and disgusted and slightly impressed by the culture smuggling up there in prison, and you might pause for a second when she slightly modifies the advice of 8 glasses of water day with \"but not all at once.\"The book has a loose structure, from one end of digestive tract to the other, but mainly this is a collection of essays on specific odd digestive trivia. That makes it perfect for background audio on my daily commute, and I'll continue to seek out her other books.The reader gets mixed grades*. She reads mostly fine, but she struggles with voices and then compensates for this by doing a lot of voices. (note to narrators of nonfiction - every person quoted doesn't need to be given a unique voice, especially not a strange one that likely has no connection to the voice of the real person quoted.)*Emily Woo Zeller won an \"AudioFile Earphones Award\" for Gulp.

There were a few things that turned my stomach (only a handful of pages total), but for the most part I was mesmerized by all I was learning about the Digestive Tract. How come competitive eaters stomachs don't burst? Did you know a person who has lost their sense of taste and smell could starve to death? How do prisoners sneak things like cell phones and tobacco into prison? Did you know saliva has antiseptic qualities? This book starts with our sense of smell and the mouth and follows the digestive tract all the way through elimination. I took so many notes (on great facts and hilarious quotes) that if I expounded on them I'd probably need to publish a book on this book ;-) If you haven't read anything by Mary Roach I have to tell you reading her books is a treat. She is irreverent at times but her total grasp of all the details pertaining to her subject, play on words, wit (including Monty Python references), impeccable research and hilarious footnotes keep you smiling. One of my favorite footnotes was in reference to asking an ad man how he got people to be in an advertising photo for an anti-gas pill. He laughed and said they didn't - they had to use stock photos because no one wants to be in those types of ads. So here is my favorite footnote:\"Back in the 1980s when everyone looked a bit off, my friend Tim and his brothers had some publicity photos taken of their band.

It seems she can make the fine balance of making a scientist such as myself happy, while also placating my inner 8-year-old. And really, all she is doing by telling us how artificial farts are made, and the size of Elvis' colon is saving us time; I know I'd be looking up articles to see if anyone has gas chromatographed a fart after reading this.

She has created a book that I purposely read slowly so I could savor every bite, picture, and footnote*. This time she takes us on a trip down the Alimentary Canal, from nose, tongue, and teeth to the bitter end of the trail with all the explorers, characters, scientists, and even Elvis to enlighten us on our way. Roach has a way of taking you along this field trip asking all the questions that you know you wouldn't have the guts to ask, of the professionals who are passionate about your gastrointestinal tract. As always, I learned a lot, laughed a lot, and dreaded to see the last page. If you've ever had a colonoscopy, constipation, heartburn, or were interested in medicine or history, this book is for you. I also learned a thesaurus' worth of terms for excreta, including my favorite--digestive ash. I am prepared for prison with details and the slang used for \"hooping\" a phone into maximum security. I know the seriousness of constipation, the wonder of saliva, the strength of my jaws and the wisdom of the anus.  As always her eye and ear for the interesting, bizarre, and absurd make wonderful reading. This time I also noticed a universal truth that bears some thought. As a teacher I've seen thousands of names, and I know enough that you don't name a child Destiny, Brandy, or Jeeves for fear of setting up the expectations of a career. I even always enjoyed reading anything about earthquakes by the renowned seismologist Dr. Waverly Person. This book not only enlightens you on human biology, but also explores the name-fate/destiny factor. I only noticed this halfway through the book, but look at the power of names for these individuals: Dr. Doctor Willard Bliss--James Garfield's doctor; gastroenterologist, Dr. Terdman; flautus researcher, Colin Leakey; and Dr. Crapo, a researcher into manure pit deaths. Take care in naming your children. Mary Roach is a national treasure. She makes science fun, scientists human, and the world around us and in us understandable and awe inspiring. My only regret is that I will have to wait two years for her next book. She is definitely not full of digestive ash.*Only one of my many favorites; \"The human disgestive tract is like the Amtrak line from Seattle to Los Angeles: transit time is about thirty hours, and the scenery on the last leg is pretty monotonous.\""}, {"userName": "Lauren ", "userReviewDate": "Mar 17, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1291915-lauren", "userReview": "Fascinating and disgusting - Roach has the corner on this market! I learned several tidbits and interesting facts... although not necessarily ones to share in polite company at the dinner table!"}], "description": "The irresistible, ever-curious, and always best-selling Mary Roach returns with a new adventure to the invisible realm we carry around inside.\u201cAmerica\u2019s funniest science writer\u201d (Washington Post) takes us down the hatch on an unforgettable tour of our insides. The alimentary canal is classic Mary Roach terrain: the questions inspired by our insides are as taboo, in their way, as the cadavers in Stiff and every bit as surreal as the universe of zero gravity explored in Packing for Mars. Why is crunchy food so appealing? Why is it so hard to find names for flavors and smells? Why doesn\u2019t the stomach digest itself? How much can you eat before your stomach bursts? Can constipation kill you? Did it kill Elvis? We meet scientists who tackle the questions no one else thinks\u2014or has the courage\u2014to ask. And we go on location to a pet-food taste-test lab, a bacteria transplant, and into a live stomach to observe the fate of a meal.Like all of Roach\u2019s books, Gulp is as much about human beings as it is about human bodies.", "title": "Gulp: Adventures on the Alimentary Canal", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13615414-gulp", "average": 3.93, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1352232547l/13615414.jpg", "reviews": 4134, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/7956.Mary_Roach", "name": "Mary Roach"}], "type": ["Nonfiction", "Humor", "Food and Drink", "Audiobook", "Health"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13615414-gulp", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17857245-gulp", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17725934-gulp", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17725929-gulp", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32912159-gulp", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32145.Stiff", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2082136.Bonk", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7237456-packing-for-mars", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14990.Spook", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191737-grunt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16498123-a-guide-to-the-present-moment", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198297-hunting-eichmann", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193094-the-breaks-of-the-game", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5312677-celebration-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40243434-soul-keeping", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22561514-the-autobiography-of-eleanor-roosevelt", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31391295-how-to-be-a-bawse", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8143199-how-remarkable-women-lead", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5440602-how-soccer-explains-the-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193421-dry", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204948-a-truck-full-of-money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40229444-animal-liberation", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19485478-a-woman-in-charge", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38272015-the-measure-of-a-man", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203910-32-yolks", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193675-recovery", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18880380-enemies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36693639-victoria", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40203983-being-nixon", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20960501-100-days-of-real-food", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40268935-barbarians-at-the-gate", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26064021-things-no-one-will-tell-fat-girls", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29465033-whipping-girl", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19730030-a-history-of-warfare", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22844509-best-friends", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18939110-let-it-go", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40192801-future-crimes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13576617-still", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35525893-sick-in-the-head", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205119-paris-1919"]}
