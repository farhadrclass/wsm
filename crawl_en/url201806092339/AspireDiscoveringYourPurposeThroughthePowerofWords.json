It was recommended reading for a homeschool retreat, so I ordered it only knowing the info you see on the cover.Surprisingly powerful and engaging, Aspire turned out to be a 5 Star read.Kevin Hall discusses the power of words. As a book-lover and aspiring writer, you might think I had already grasped that concept, but this book has a different angle than you might expect. Hall talks about the original meanings behind words, helping us to grasp a much fuller understanding of the words and concepts.I found myself highlighting many parts, but I was particularly interested in the original meanings of the words. The first word Kevin Hall discusses is Ganshai. While this word is not a familiar one to English speakers (It's actually an ancient Hindi word.), the meaning is powerful. \"Genshai means that you never treat anyone small--and that includes yourself...If I were to walk by a beggar in the street and casually toss him a coin, I would not be practicing Genshai. But if I knelt down on my knees and looked him in the eye when I placed that coin in his hand, that coin became love. Then and only then, after I had exhibited pure, unconditional brotherly love, would I become a true practitioner of Genshai.\"Other words discussed include: Pathfinder (leader), Namaste, Passion, Sapere Vedere, Humility, Inspire, Empathy, Coach, Ollin, and Integrity, among others.Listen to this: \"Originating with the Greeks, 'enthusiasm' means God within or God's gifts within. Enthusiasm, he went on to explain, is the fuel of happiness and bliss. It refers to the divine light that shines within each of us.\" Do you see how just understanding where the words came from can open our eyes to a deeper understanding and a new commitment to live well?I was drawn to concepts that I could apply to myself as a mother and teacher of my children. \"To inspire to breathe into. The Master of Words explained that when we breathe life into another, we inspire their hopes, goals, and dreams...When you 'encourage', you add to some-one's heart. And when you 'discourage,' you take away from someone's heart.\"And I loved this: \"Originally crafted for aristocracy, coaches carried important people to their desired destinations in luxury and ease...Over time, other forms of transportation adopted the term \"coach\"...But however far-reaching and prevalent the word has become since the first coach rolled out of production in Kocs, the meaning has not changed. A \"coach\" remains something, or someone, who carries a valued person from where they are to where they want to be.\"I recommend this book for people who want to increase their understanding of language and aim for self-improvement."}, {"userName": "Michael Watkins", "userReviewDate": "Mar 21, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5160124-michael-watkins", "userReview": "I can proudly say that the Professor is my Grandfather! I was reading this book with a different set of eyes, mostly zeroing on things my Grandfather would say or offer. I always remember him lecturing us on his linguistic knowledge or offering a story from his life, all very fascinating. The book offered interesting insights and stories from Kevin's life, as well as those he has come to know. Everything was really well-written and logical. One complaint I have about the book is it almost feels as if Kevin is hiding the fact that he lives in Utah (always refers to living 'in the Rocky Mountains', etc), and that he is LDS (Mormon). Not that you must disclose that, but my Grandfather was a professor at BYU...a private university owned by the LDS church. Also not mentioned, even though BYU has some of the best and leading linguistics programs in the world. It wouldn't really matter to me, but whenever he mentions places outside of Utah, he offers details about where he is and what he is doing. When he is inside of Utah, it's clear to me that he is in Utah because I have been there many times. Very vague if you aren't as familiar."}, {"userName": "Becky", "userReviewDate": "Oct 17, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6702221-becky", "userReview": "Aspire Discovering You Purpose Through the Power of Words is a book like no other I have ever read. I couldn\u2019t put it down and I find myself reading it over and over, underlining, highlighting and sharing its content on my facebook and blog. I have gifted about 40 books. The secret word reveled in chapter one shot right to my heart, leaving me more conscientious of the words I speak and the way I treat others. I am a happier, kinder person having learned the meaning of Genshai. Thank you Kevin for writing and sharing your wisdom and insight of Genshai and the other 10 powerful words and their meanings. Aspire breathed new life into me and has inspired me to go after my dreams with the confidence that I can do anything. It was catastrophic in sending me on a journey of networking and surrounding myself with incredible people. I recently was able to go to India to teach a goal setting program at a college for young women. One of the highlights of my trip was teaching the 700 plus young women the meaning of the word Genshai and gifting 15 teachers their own copy of Aspire. Aspire is changing lives all over the world. I highly recommend Aspire to everyone! It\u2019s a feel good, do good, and be good, kind of book.

Emails, text messages, and smart phones make the need for people to learn how to write and communicate almost nonexistent. Aspire: Discovering Your Purpose Through the Power of Words reminded me why I loved being an English major and that I really like words and what words stand for. But this book has nothing to do with being an English major.Aspire is a non-fiction book that is broken up into eleven different chapters that each focus on a different word (well words really) and how practicing that word can really change your life for the better. Words that we all hear and know like passion, humility, and inspire. And words that we don't all know well like ollin and sapere vedere. Each chapter includes some sort of story or anecdote where Hall explains how he learned the true meaning of each of these words.There were a lot of things that I really liked about this book, but there were two things that I absolutely loved. Each chapter, along with a poignant anecdote, also included a true linguistic explanation of each word (e.g., inspire comes from the Latin \"inspirare,\" and \"spirare\" means to breathe. So inspire literally means to breathe into). The linguistic explanations were fascinating to me and really tied into Hall's explanations of each word. And the second part I loved was Hall's \"journal thoughts\" about each word at the end of each chapter. It allowed me more of an insight into the mind of the author as he thought through each word and the true meaning behind it.Overall I really enjoyed this book and finished it with a newly gained knowledge and appreciation for words and even more than that, for becoming a better person. All of the words that Hall focuses on are characteristics of the people I admire the most - empathy, humility, coach - and characteristics that I think we all can use some work on. 5 stars."}, {"userName": "Jason Coombs", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7106444-jason-coombs", "userReview": "Can Aspire help me with my addictions? The answer is YES!My name is Jason and I am a recovering addict/alcoholic. My dear friend, Steve Carlston, gifted Aspire to me about two years ago. The book sat in my car for two weeks until one night while working a graveyard shift I decided to grab it and read the first chapter. At the time I was only interested in book about addiction recovery, but I didn't want to let the gift from Steve go to waste. For the first time in my life, I was absolutely captivated reading a book. I was blindsided that the entire book aligned with everything I had learned in recovery. Principles that saved my life: such as humility, honoring my God-given gifts, relying on my Higher Power, serving others, and being willing to suffer for what I love. Furthermore, my recovery took on a deeper, more personal meaning to me. I started to set goals for my life and decided to face some of the fears that were holding me back. I made the decision to begin exercising again and have lost 65 pounds. I made the decision to go back to school and get my Masters in Professional Communications and I have one more year left. I decided to begin the process of writing my own book about the gifts I learned through my addiction. My relationships are more meaningful to me than ever before. Ultimately, I understand my purpose in life and that is to assist and inspire others who suffer from addiction find hope and meaning in their suffering. The principles Kevin taught me in Aspire have given me a new life. Today I am in my third year of sobriety and I have never been happier. By reading Aspire, my recovery was injected with new hope, clarity, and motivation. I recommend it to anyone who struggles with addiction, hopelessness, or limiting beliefs. We all have our struggles in life and this book gives them a sacred meaning and directions to overcome them. Just read the first chapter and you will see what I mean. Kevin, you are my brother and I thank you for sharing this gift with me.

It is easy to read but as I read it, it stirs something deep within in me an understanding and a recognition of truth of which I deep down inherently have always known and felt.

I feel like I am ready to swing these doors wide and begin to live life to my fullest potential.

She said there were two books that she read last year that absolutely transformed her life. One of these books was, Aspire. With that I purchased this book and began my journey. I\u2019m finding this book to be a revelation to be pondered, thought about, and written about in my journal as I read and study each chapter with the wealth of ideas, thoughts, quotes and stories. Sometimes within a couple of days of reading a chapter, I find circumstances popping up in my life where all of a sudden the meaning in the book and how to apply it in my life becomes clearer. Using the new insights I\u2019ve found my path lighted to help me go in a \u201cdifferent direction\u201d, than I otherwise would have. I\u2019m thrilled at what is happening within me as I read, ponder and apply the lessons within. I would recommend this book to anyone who is on a journey to live their best life."}, {"userName": "Nate", "userReviewDate": "Jan 18, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7464741-nate", "userReview": "What could be more important than communication? How many conflicts and how much strife in our world's history, could have been prevented if the parties involved truly understood each other? And, what could be more essential in today's world than understanding how the words we use effect and affect our lives and our world? I've always been a believer in etymology as an important tool for improving communication, but Kevin's taken this to another level, with his ability to inspire and irradiate the soul of the reader through the study of some of the most powerful words in spoken/ written language. If you're interested in improving your communication skills, enlightening your soul, revitalizing your mind, and increasing your empathy with an inspiring book, Kevin Hall's Aspire is a modern classic, in the arena of inspirational self-improvement literature, that I believe you will enjoy immensely. Leonardo da Vinci had seven principles by which he lived his life, and inspired the world. In a similar fashion, Kevin Hall offers 11 words, which, when understood through the paradigm of this book, can transform lives, and thus the world, in the most Awesome way imaginable. I'm am watching for Kevin's next book, \"Healing through the power of words\" with great anticipation."}, {"userName": "Mari Landeros", "userReviewDate": "Nov 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5486830-mari-landeros", "userReview": "THIS IS what's stayed in my MIND.Humility is one of the most misunderstood and misapplied words in all of language. Humility is not being passive and submissive, nor is it distinguished by slumping shoulders, bowed heads and subservient downward glaces. Humility is about being TEACHABLE and COACHABLE. It trademarks a continual COMMITMENT to LEARNING and growing and expanding. It is living life in crescendo, w/ shoulders back and heads up as we reach and stretch to become our very best, and then extend ourselves to HELP OTHERS do the same. And then, we start again.Reading the book of \"ASPIRE\" By Kevin Hall # Page 115 The middle of any journey always gets more difficult-- as does the middle of accomplishing our goals and dreams. That is where true passion comes in. But what symbolizes our life is the hyphen in between. What happens in the middle? What happens between the traumatic moments? The euphoric moments? And now, through a combination of hell and heaven of our own making.Page 85 of the Book \"ASPIRE\" by Kevin Hall( Recommend reading this book it is AMAZING!!

I would put it in my top two inspirational books along with Byron Katie's \"Loving What Is.\" It is a triumph and specifically speaks to me because my love and my life are lived with words and Mr. Hall uses words to illuminate the beauty of the human condition. I think I was teary-eyed pretty much every chapter because I was so moved and I found many things that I will use to help motivate myself and to propel myself from a good man to a great man. I believe that the struggle for greatness is something that is ongoing and I hope that I will be able to use Mr. Halls lessons to become better and to remind myself to love life and to give to others freely. Please, read this book, it is something that will give to you and enrich you."}, {"userName": "Carolyn", "userReviewDate": "Nov 11, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6944068-carolyn", "userReview": "I am a journalist and write for Examiner.com (online news) as the Phoenix (AZ) Genealogy Examiner.

In Aspire! he teaches readers to understand what words mean in their purest sense and unlock their importance as they develop a thoughtful new vocabulary.As Stephen R. Covey so beautifully elucidates in his foreword, \"this masterfully written book will help you understand that words have an inherent power, a force capable of lighting one\u2032s paths and horizons. Used correctly and positively, words are the first building blocks for success and inner peace. Used incorrectly and negatively, they are capable of undermining even the best of intentions. This is true in business, in personal relationships, and every other walk of life.\"By focusing on eleven words-one per chapter--Aspire! shows how to use these words as building blocks for success and inner peace.
