There was a time in my life when I read all of those books, and enjoyed a great many of them, but I've never felt a compelling need to swim in those waters again. That said, every once in a while you will find a story that is truly well done. One series that stuck with me from my childhood was the \"Blood of Kerensky\" series by Michael Stackpole. It's a favorite I come back to every couple of years.Stackpole was a stalwart of the RPG writer scene before becoming a novel writer, having worked for a time at Flying Buffalo/FASA (which is how I originally became acquainted with him). The \"Blood of Kerensky\" books are set in the Battletech universe which, for those of you who don't know, is a post-diaspora-to-the-stars, future war concept with different political factions duking it out in giant robots called \"Mechs\". It's ground that's been well traveled in Japanese Anime but here it's given a western, military sci-fi flavor.Stackpole, to his credit, plays this material straight, keeping it action forward with strong but simple characters. You don't care that it's a bunch of guys in robot suits because after a short while you are interested in their personal lives, their successes, failures and relationships.A few related books followed the original trilogy but they never quite live up to the level of Stackpole's writing here. I wish he had explored this world a bit more fully, because he was very well suited to it."}, {"userName": "Clint", "userReviewDate": "Apr 06, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/62343833-clint", "userReview": "Boringtech. Man, Stackpole sure wrote some thick Battletech tomes back in the day! And that\u2019s not a good thing. This book is boring to the extreme. It could easily have been cut by half. There is way too much time spent with nothing happening.Case in point: the entire first third of the book. You can skip it all, because nothing happens. Only when the clans start invading (finally!) does the action pick up the pace a little. But not by much. Reading this is a real slog.There are also way too many characters and POVs to keep track of mentally. None of these characters are all that different from each other, which makes it harder. And it is constantly switching back and forth. I finally figured out who is who toward the end of the book.The main characters have a lot of weird names. Here is a brief bio of each:Feelin\u2019 Kell - He pines for his old girlfriend a lot, then becomes a prisoner of war. After that, he follows the time-honored \u201cDances with Wolves\u201d storyline where he slowly builds grudging respect with his captors and then later becomes one of them. Gets a clannie girlfriend first, of course. It always starts with the girlfriend...Kai Mallard-Layo - He too pines for his girlfriend. He\u2019s a Solaris 7 guy. Mostly he just doubts himself a lot, or so we are told. He gets a Moment of Awesome(TM) in the book. Then he spends the rest of the book whining about it.Shin Yo\u2019mama - Has a great appreciation for ancient Japanese architecture. He also spends a lot of time doing cool, ninja-ey Japanese stuff, and talking about honor and dragons and such. Is REALLY into tattoos.Victor Steiner-Davion - Doesn\u2019t do anything the entire book.There were a lot more characters but those seemed to be the author\u2019s faves.Reading this, I\u2019m kind of struck by how thin the Battletech universe really is. There were a couple of things that stood out to me.For one, you never really get a true sense of the size and scale of this universe. We are talking about hundreds of populated worlds here. But in the story, it\u2019s like each entire world only has one city. And it\u2019s usually only one small mech battle to capture an ENTIRE planet. I don\u2019t think this is realistic at all. You can\u2019t capture a whole nation with just a few tanks. Scale it up to Battlemechs, and even a thousand of them wouldn\u2019t be enough to conquer every city on an entire planet. The scope of a true planetary invasion would be enormous! And it would be extremely costly in terms of ships and manpower. This is never depicted realistically in any Battletech book.Another thing is just exactly how goofy the whole Battlemech idea really is. I mean, we have ships here who can nuke an entire planet\u2019s surface from orbit. Surely something that dangerous could easily target an enemy mech on the ground and annihilate it from space. The ramifications of having that much power, and what it would really mean in terms of a war, is barely touched on in this book. It\u2019s touched on, but pretty much sidestepped. With ships like that, mechs would be useless. All you would need is marines to take the ground.I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m just getting too old for this kiddie stuff I guess. I loved Battletech back in the day, but these books for the most part seem really lame. I\u2019ve become used to good science fiction like things written by Ian Banks and William Barton. This Battletech stuff is just empty filler, like eating a bag of potato chips. Oh well. I\u2019ll press on. I\u2019ve bought the kindle books and am curious how it all ends. We will see!"}, {"userName": "Jacob", "userReviewDate": "May 21, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2540040-jacob", "userReview": "I read this because my recent re-introduction into the Battletech universe (Harebrained Schemes superb game) got me curious about the lore. I had read this back when I was maybe 12 or 13, and found the entire Blood of Kerensky trilogy for maybe 3 bucks at Half Price Books. Being a huge MechWarrior fan at them time (as well as a proponent of needlessly capitalized letters in the middle of words) I remember really enjoying this book, so much so that I\u2019ve been recommending it to people well into my 30s.I\u2019m not going to lie, I may have to rescind those recommendations. If you like Battletech, this book is readable. It rewards a familiarity with the lore (as do most franchise fiction series from the mid-90s...lookin at you Shadowrun) but this comes at a cost of feeling very lost if you aren\u2019t. Stockpole attempts to get around this with some seriously, uh, interesting dialogue choices. Each of the main characters gives a soliloquy in their initial chapters, explaining who they are, their heritage, their motivations, their desires. In at least one case, this monologue is delivered to an empty beach with nobody in particular there to listen, aside from the reader. This continues throughout the book, as liberal use of italics as internal monologue continue to explain some of the more finicky plot points that might go over the heads of readers. Unfortunately, this feels like the characters being over-explanatory and verbose, almost like they\u2019re talking down to you. I have my critiques about the way the plot is presented as well. The plot, honestly, is superb: after centuries of war between several states, all those states are invaded by a mysterious force with advanced technology and seemingly unstoppable tactics. Man, that\u2019s a great story!Except you, the reader, are privy to the truth in the first 25% of the book. By the time the Successor States are figuring out what the nature of the invasion is, you are already experiencing the other side of this invasion from another POV character. Everything that comes after seems hollow. Imagine if the White Walkers in Game of Thrones got their own POV chapter in the first book.In the end, I can dissect what went wrong and what didn\u2019t, but it boils down to this: if you\u2019re just curious about the lore, go look at the Battletech wiki. If you\u2019re looking to read about the Clan Invasion after that, then pick up the book.I\u2019ll be reading the rest of the series, honestly, because the book does set you up with an interesting premise for the next. I\u2019m just going to be hoping that less things will be explained to me via internal monologues so I can draw my own conclusions about the plot."}, {"userName": "Magussartori", "userReviewDate": "May 01, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/57674401-magussartori", "userReview": "These novelettes were absolutely entertaining, but they weren't what I would call well written. The plot moves at blinding speeds covering literally years and massive world-significant events in a matter of sentences or an offhand bit of dialogue. The result is that the novels are a series of things that happened, with little foreshadowing or other storytelling artistry.Note that while I'm being very critical of the book, I don't intend to condemn the author. Rather I think that the stories were severely handicapped by their short format, which was likely not in the author's control. A Song of Ice and Fire level of material is being jammed into 3 tiny novelettes. Quite naturally reading them is going to feel like you're hanging on to a wild bull.Rather I applaud Stackpole for being able to surface multiple interesting characters from this cacophony and give them unique voices.Still, the story would have greatly benefited from being a trilogy of 3 full-length novels rather than a trilogy of mini-novels."}, {"userName": "Stewart", "userReviewDate": "Mar 29, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/71962032-stewart", "userReview": "I listened to the Audiobook over on Audible. It was abridged, which is a bummer. I listen as I work and can knock out a 3 hour book (like all these Battletech books) in a day. But, you get the gist of the story. It's a pretty good story as well. Knowing the lore from playing the board game and video games as a kid I didn't miss out on much. The 1994 animated series is based off of these novels. I'd recommend giving this series a go if you like Sci-Fi. The Innersphear is a totally believable thing. Humans expand out and colonize worlds only to have progress halted by infighting. Corporations manipulate States, Houses, and Nations to bring on a new dark age. There is some believability that has to be pushed aside but the story makes sense as does the believability of the universe."}, {"userName": "Vojtech", "userReviewDate": "Oct 26, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5051728-vojtech", "userReview": "Brought back memories of playing Battletech universe tabletop and video games back in the days. I really wanted to like this book more, but unfortunately there are just too many factions and characters to really care about anyone. Then again, this book is probably just setting the scene for an epic series. I am not sure I have the time or will to follow along, but who knows - maybe at some point in the future. Definitely not as good as I remember Saga of the Grey Death legion to be - but hey, that's probably almost 20 years ago now :-)"}, {"userName": "Kimball Newton", "userReviewDate": "Apr 04, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/80293873-kimball-newton", "userReview": "Epic undersells the scale of which the story moves. Following the many characters and following the development between in the inner sphere. I love Stackpole's style and how he takes the characters to a different height through their actions. Everything feels so real and lifelike, even the deadly clans seem to have a real lifelike driving force. Start of the trilogy that got me back into reading.

The politics are well played out and you start to get a feel for the different societies. I especially like the way Stackpole writes and describes 'Mech combat.

At the time I wasn't much older than the \"second generation\" characters in the book - Kai Allard, Phelan Kell and the others. Also, I had played a lot of Battletech in my youth and the Clan invasion was a natural continuation in what I thought was a fascinating story of politics and war. Most of that is really still true - the Battletech Universe is vast and sprawling, yet feels very human. The technology is a little dated (some of the high-tech depicted has already been surpassed, 1000-something years early). But overall I still can get excited about the world and its characters. But the writing is just bad. Bad. Bad. Michael Stackpole was always one of the best, maybe the best of FASA's writers and did a lot of good work in both Battletech and Shadowrun. But this book was just painfully poor in regard to realistic responses, characterizations and so on.

I mean, the story is deep and engaging, but it's not dark by any means. The plot points all tie up nicely with satisfying, feel-good kind of conclusions, even if they are quite predictable. Anytime you find yourself saying, \"I hope such-and-such happens\" it generally happens that way.But with that said, the characters are memorable (I'm a fan of Phelan Kell and Kai Allard-Liao) and there's enough action and plot to keep you turning the pages.This really is the must read trilogy for anyone into the Battletech universe."}, {"userName": "Brad Wheeler", "userReviewDate": "Jun 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4959290-brad-wheeler", "userReview": "I picked this up on a whim because I remember enjoying it when I was younger, and re-reading Michael Stackpole's X-Wing novels is something I still do every couple of years. They still hold up.That's not the case with this bad boy. It was entertaining enough; I still like the science fiction war feudalism thing that Battletech has going on. But the writing was really clumsy, obviously Stackpole was less experienced and confident. Lots of telling rather than showing, particularly of characters' feelings.
