Alison Heller: the book you would get if Jane Austen had gone to law school and settled in to write at a Brooklyn Cafe. It's quick, funny, sharp and romantic. Perfectly paced, laugh-out-loud hilarious, with a Mr. Darcy-surprise that will make you do a dance on your couch. I couldn't put it down. Can you tell I loved this book?!"}, {"userName": "Isabella", "userReviewDate": "Aug 19, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/22622445-isabella", "userReview": "FINALLY. It\u2019s been difficult, but I\u2019ve finally found a protagonist in a chick-lit novel who isn\u2019t the owner of a cupcake bakery, who isn\u2019t a florist, and who doesn\u2019t have a glamorous job in marketing. A character with a normal job seems to be a rarity in this genre, and it\u2019s so refreshing to be able to immerse myself in the life of someone who deals with such mundane things as deadlines and student loans.That\u2019s not to say The Love Wars is stereotype-free, but it is a witty and charming novel with pitch-perfect pacing and characters with which you instantly develop a connection. I devoured it in a single sitting.Molly Grant is a corporate lawyer with a top-tier law firm in New York whose life is segmented neatly into billable hours. After an epiphany triggered by seeing a sleek, stylish divorce lawyer in the office lift, she transfers to the family law division, where the rose-tinted glasses quickly fall away. A narcissistic senior partner, selfish and unlikeable clients and the inherent drama of family law ensure that life is not quite as cushy as it might have seemed from behind her desk in the dull-as-dishwater Commercial Law department.A challenge to a custody arrangement between a media mogul and his ex-wife, taken on pro bono by Molly, forms the backbone of the novel, and dominates to such an extent that the romance is relegated to a mere sub-plot. The characters involved are so well-written and sympathetic that I was much more emotionally invested in the outcome of the case than in the outcome of the Molly\u2019s love triangle with an ex and a work colleague. Part of the problem is that, in contrast to the rest of her characters, Heller really needed to have padded out Molly\u2019s ex-boyfriend a little more. As it is, there is literally nothing memorable or charismatic about him and I\u2019m left a little mystified as to why, exactly, Molly is so hung-up on him. The fact that he is so very two-dimensional really lessens any drama and suspense that the love triangle may have had. Molly\u2019s colleagues and clients leap off the page, but when Heller (a former lawyer herself) stops writing what she knows and moves away from lawyers and the law, I feel the quality of her writing suffers.It\u2019s probably time for a full disclosure here: I love law-related books and shows. I even tuned in loyally every week to watch Miss Match, an execrable series starring Alicia Silverstone as a divorce attorney who drafted divorce settlements by day \u2026 and match-made by night. It was ridiculous (and short-lived) but, for some time, I toyed with the idea of working in family law. Now that I\u2019ve almost completed my law degree, I have a better appreciation of the stress and emotion involved with this area of law. Heller does a great job in reflecting this in a fairly realistic manner. Divorce and custody proceedings can be intense and confronting, but Heller treats the subject with respect, rather than mining it for cheap laughs or trashy melodrama. Even the least likeable clients occasionally evoke pity.The lack of zing in terms of the actual romance is only a minor complaint. I understand that Molly\u2019s romance coming second to her work may be a deal-breaker for some readers, but for me, Molly was too sympathetic and the case too interesting for it to be much of a problem. Taken as a whole, The Love Wars contains everything I like in a romance read: sharp writing, quick pace, an intelligent plot and likeable characters. Thoroughly recommended!For more book reviews, see my blog Fictitious and Delicious."}, {"userName": "Samantha March", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4681357-samantha-march", "userReview": "I received a copy of The Love Wars by L.

It was interesting how much I learned from the book, mainly about law and the processes that go on during a divorce and the dynamics of a law firm. There\u2019s a bit of romance thrown in between the pages, but that is not the focal part of the story, and I really enjoyed that.

I am totally blown away by this book!!!! I LOVED it! I read it VERY VERY fast and I have to say, it really hit home with me. This book touched a VERY personal place in my heart. I myself was taken through an awful custody battle and unlike Fern in the book, I could not find an attorney to take my case without thousands of dollars and I ended up losing my children. They were taken by the state and I now have been diagnosed with PTSD, Major Depressive Disorder, Generalized Anxiety Disorder, on top of being diagnosed with OCD. Losing your kids is such a terrible and emotional thing and I was so touched that inclusive in the story were cute sentimental times with Molly but the base part of the book was Molly standing up for what she believed in to HELP a mother who needed it. I was brought to tears several times remembering my loss and how it affected me and I was so grateful that even in someone's imagination, there are kind civil attorney's who love their work and know they have to be there to stand up for those who do NOT have the money too. Thanks so much for this tiny bit of inspiration.

From start to finish a joy to read and I can't say that about many books right now.Molly Grant is a matrimonial attorney at a prestigious Manhattan law firm that caters to the rich and famous. One client changes everything for Molly and she begins to re-examine her career and who she represents. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who is considering reading so I will leave it at that.Finally, a heroine to root for. Molly is smart, funny and just a good person. I've read some chick-lit lately that main characters just annoy me. Hard to believe premises and heroines that are just impossible to relate to. Not so in The Love Wars which is a breathe of fresh air. It is hard to believe this is Ms. Heller's first book.

I have a soft spot for chick-lit but I usually hate the main characters. They all seem to be ditzy or have a knack for being on one side or the other of cheating, which drives me insane. Molly Grant is smart, relatable, and doesn't find her way into the pants of a married man. Molly's story focuses more on her crazy boss and helping out someone in need.I found myself taking local trains to/from work because I wanted to spend more time with The Love Wars.

The romance subplot is secondary, maybe even tertiary. It's all about Molly finding out what kind of lawyer she wants to be.

Alison Heller. We all remember the novels or stories that showcase a hardworking newbie attorney working their way up the difficult corporate law field with the best of intentions at heart. This is exactly the case for Molly Grant who lives in New York City working for one of the most prestigious law firms Bacon Payne. Their client base is some of the wealthiest people in the world and when Molly finds that working on the bottom rung a little too long, she opts to work for the Matrimonial Division. Here under the leadership of high powered attorney Lillian Starling who handled all the firms high-profile divorce cases. It was here you either were on top of her list of favorites, called her 'girls' or you were on top of her hit list meaning you won't last a day once you make it there. Molly just hopes to last long enough to secure what's known as a Payne-ment, which is a bonus equivalent to a years salary so she can pay off the law school loan her parents have had to take out to send her to school. Just under two years to go and she'll have it in the bag and life will get much easier to bear. For now, however it means jumping when Lillian asks her to jump and to not ask how high but to already know how high and to exceed those expectations, working anything less than 16 hour days is unheard of and if you make one simple mistake you can count your career at Bacon Payne a good-bye. Molly starts to question working for some of this highly demanding clients who seem to think she is there strictly to appease them at all costs instead of handing their law cases. When she finds herself dealing with the wife of one of their clients, Fern Walker. When Lillian asks her to oversee some of the issues regarding the child custody arrangement between the Walkers, Molly finds herself facing a dilemma that probably tries most legitimate attorneys. Is it possible to still work for Bacon Payne and work a legal case against one of their clients? Everything Molly has ever worked for is on the line, but after an episode in Molly's past, she finds that she might have to bend the rules a lot to make up for a possible second chance to do something noble and worthwhile instead of merely winning another divorce case. I received The Love Wars by L. Alison Heller compliments of Penguins Publishing and Book Sparks Book Tours for my honest review and received no monetary compensation for a favorable review. This is a great look at what the world of high-profile family law looks like from the outside. It seems that even though the cases are similar, in the world of the rich and wealthy, no demand is too small for some. It shows you what can ultimately happen when good people stand up for those that need it the most. I'd rate this one a 4 out of 5 stars due to my personal rating system. The book does contain some profanity and thus the reason for a lower rating. If you ever wanted to know what working for a law firm that deals with the high profile cases looks like, you might just want to pick this one up. Truly some of the things that the attorneys have to work with are a bit on the outrageous side and really makes you wonder just how true this novel might be to the real world. I know personally I could not work for Bacon Payne. I think sometimes people fail to remember the innocent people that will become collateral damage in the process of some divorce cases."}, {"userName": "Romancing the Book", "userReviewDate": "May 25, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5328566-romancing-the-book", "userReview": "Reviewed by RobinBook provided by Spark Point Studio for reviewReview originally posted at Romancing the BookMolly Grant a different type of heroine. She is a lawyer with a conscious. She is smart, easy to relate to, warm, caring and because of the conscious she just may succeed in the cutthroat business of being a lawyer. Things happen for reasons I like to think and when things happen to Molly it is no different. Not one that is really into Chick-Lit per say I found this to be a very entertaining story. It shows that perhaps there are some lawyers out there that do have a heart just like Molly.Molly may soon find herself out of a job. Trying to make her life have more meaning she takes a new job in the law firm she works for. There was an incident in law school; her parents struggled to help her pay for law school and Molly find that her loans have become quite overwhelming. Life just has a way of sucking every so often. She finds that no matter how much you work to get ahead it seems as if you get further behind. So therefore a new job may be what she needs. With a new job comes a new boss, Lillian\u2026a real barracuda. I found her to be way too intense. She needed to lighten up a little. But, I guess she didn\u2019t get where she is at being too soft. Lillian tends to be rather moody, changes her mind allot which equates into longer hours and much more work. Molly thinks she needs to just stick it out for five years grab her bonus and all her money troubles will be righted. As there new person in the Marriage department Molly finds she doesn\u2019t fell she will make it to that five year mark. When Lillian dumps Fern in Molly\u2019s lap, Molly rethinks her whole purpose of being a lawyer. Thus she becomes the lawyer with a conscious.I really enjoyed this story. A great book to add to your list of summer reads for the beach or if you don\u2019t have plans something to curl up with and enjoy. The characters all with unique personalities were a little on the quirky side. But they were there to help Molly and proved to be really good friends at work and outside of work. How many can say that about their co-workers. Ms. Heller shows that there is always hope for the underdog that you just have to find the right person to help. She gives Molly that never gives up attitude. It was fun to see how things unfolded as Molly took on a client she was to have gotten rid of. Ms. Heller took her insight about lawyers and gave us a more realistic side with a touch of humor thrown in. She took the ordinary and expanded on it to create just the right balance of humor making us think that just maybe lawyers are real people after all.A really light story with a humorous look into what happens when you try to take on to much while struggling with your regular work load and the one that your heart tells you not to give up on. You can\u2019t help but fall for Molly, her co-workers and yes even Lillian. A delightfully entertaining story with substance."}, {"userName": "Viviane Crystal", "userReviewDate": "Jul 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2682057-viviane-crystal", "userReview": "Molly Grant is employed as a corporate lawyer for the prestigious law firm of Bacon Payne; she\u2019s okay with the 16 hour days because that\u2019s the cost of earning one\u2019s way into partner status. One day she hears a conversation in the elevator and soon thereafter applies to work in the Divorce Department. No, this isn\u2019t a bleak, suffering, painful novel; Molly describes her work in a light manner that is both amusing at the foolish demands and counter-demands of couples ending a marriage; satire at the laws that dictate who gets what material goods; and poignant moments when one is on the brink of losing a child and Molly is bold enough to put on her fighting style for the sake of what is truly right and wrong and not just \u201cbillable.\u201dUpon entry into the marital real of legal affairs at Bacon Payne, Molly meets Lillian Starling, a high power, driven attorney who either totally loves her \u201cgirls\u201d or fires them with the most absolutely withering phrases and insults, with no in-between moments. When Molly meets Fern Walker and hears her story, she is reminded of another request for help from a threatened mother years ago and how cavalierly she was turned away since protecting an abused spouse was not the area of the facility where Molly was then interning. Deciding to represent Fern Walker is risky because Fern\u2019s husband is a very high profile customer of Bacon Payne. Fern knows there\u2019s a conflict of interest and yet believes she can manage it by starting her own firm. There\u2019s another bonus in that Molly would get the chance to represent needy clients and not the rich snobs who constantly range from cajoling, insulting and bossy ordering snobs.How Molly can manage to do her normal work, pay off her college loans her parents assumed for her dream career, and juggle friends and dates is funny, cool, and interesting. For there are elements of the law that aren\u2019t dry and boring but instead specifically designed to be neutral in order to protect a wife or husband from losing a child, an event that could quite literally destroy that person forever. Molly also forms new relationships with colleagues that are honest, straight-forward, challenging, and more reflective of the family-like atmosphere of many law firms that succeed because of successful lawyers and a collegial team spirit and an additional touch of spicy appeal.The Love Wars is a fascinating look at divorce law and the lawyers and clients who pass through its gates briefly but with all the drama of a high speed roller coaster. L. Alison Heller presents the topic and gutsy, intelligent characters with panache and an obviously personal knowledge of the subject. This may be her first novel but it is definitely a successful endeavor and will leave readers eagerly anticipating more and better of this author with a definite, unique style! Well done, indeed, L.

One wrong move, and her boss will turn on her, and Molly will lose everything she's worked so hard for.The problem is Fern Walker, ex-wife of a powerful man who is intentionally depriving her of their children, and poisoning them against their mother.

Read it in 8 hours, I couldn't put it down. Molly is a very likeable, relatable character. There was lots of humor in the situations Molly finds herself in, yet the topic of divorce and custody are treated with the seriousness they deserve. Can't wait to read Heller's next book!Thanks To Goodreads First Reads for the free book."}, {"userName": "Eva", "userReviewDate": "Apr 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16852996-eva", "userReview": "This is an excellent read.
