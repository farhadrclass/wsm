Mike is investigating the suicide of a beautiful young woman who had it all. She also happens to be the daughter of his former boss. Usually with Amis you know you\u2019re going to get a lot of laugh out loud humour and some dazzling passages. This isn\u2019t quite the case with Night Train.

It looks like suicide, but why ever would she have killed herself? It's interesting to see Martin Amis's picture of someone who had everything to live for. Her talented and handsome partner loved her; he says bitterly that it's kind of embarrassing to admit how much time they spent in bed together. And she was an astrophysicist, doing cutting-edge work in cosmology.Sex and astrophysics: what could make anyone happier? I thought of this book yesterday when the CERN physicist we'd invited to dinner told us, as he held his beautiful wife's hand, about cosmology's long-term plans. Over the last decade, we've managed to map the Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation, which comes from the Last Scattering Surface; the moment, a few hundred thousand years after the Big Bang, when space became transparent. It's told us remarkable things about the Universe. But there are still huge mysteries concerning what went before. Now, I learned, there is a far more ambitious dream: if we could build a neutrino telescope, we'd be able to see back to a point two seconds after the Universe began. It's possible that we'd be able to catch neutrinos that had come straight from that time to us, without interacting with anything en route. A direct message almost from the moment of creation. So far, no one has any idea how to do this. But it doesn't seem out of the question that it will be possible one day. Okay, Martin, now I see what you meant.

The death is ruled a suicide but Colonel Tom is not so sure and asks Mike to look into it.In a way this story is a straight up crime suspense novel but it's also really very different from others I've read. The narrator makes little attempt to clarify her own thinking in a way that lets people outside of police to know what she means. There are times that her comments are opaque to me and I was a bit baffled by them. This ends up doing an excellent job of immersing you in the narrator's world but it's a world that's far outside of my own experience. I thought at first that this would diminish my ability to enjoy the book but I was very wrong there. Somehow it ended up getting me more locked in on what was going on.Somewhere around the 2/3 mark this book sucked me in and wouldn't let me go. Any attempt to pry it out of my hands would have resulted in a full blown tantrum, I'm pretty sure. Or the person attempting the prying would have had to drag me around the house with the book. By the end the book ratcheted up the suspense to an agonizing level and I actually felt enormous relief in the final paragraph. It still took a long time for my heart to stop pounding but I at least felt relief!It absolutely amazes me that the author sucked me in that much in a book that was only 175 pages.

In Night Train, he adopts the voice of a tough American female cop, Mike Hoolihan, who's investigating her friend's supposed suicide. It's a pastiche of a particular sort of police procedural, edging into erotic thriller territory - it reminded me a lot of \nIn the Cut\n by Susanna Moore, published in the same late-90s period. Riddled with deliberate cliches interspersed by passages of clever wordplay, it's an effective and really quite easy read, but there's something haunting about it, too."}, {"userName": "Misha", "userReviewDate": "Jul 11, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2205814-misha", "userReview": "Not a bad way to start my reading year in 2010.I found this a flawed, but in the end quite excellent, book. I wish Amis had just gone ahead and set it in the U.K., as I can see no reason for it being set in America other than the use of a handgun. It unfortunately read like something written by a British author, not quite American enough to truly take place here. For example, the opening paragraph in which the main character insists that cops would refer to themselves as \"a police\" is just wrong, and every time Amis used that construction, I wanted to scream at him. No American cop would ever refer to him or herself as \"a police\" or \"the murder police.\" They're \"cops\" and \"Homicide.\" I say this as a reporter who's spent a fair amount of time talking to cops -- daily for about two years at one point in my career. It's one of those things that was annoying enough to pull me out of the book whenever I came across it.The book took a little time to get going. I think once Amis got past the police procedural elements and really started exploring the characters is when it took off. The book really is a character study of two women -- the narrator, Detective Mike Hoolihan, and the suicide victim, Jennifer Rockwell. It's a study in contrasts in some ways. Jennifer gets all the breaks while Mike takes all the beatings, and yet it's Mike who's ultimately better equipped to survive in a pretty senseless world.I also think it's a meditation on the senselessness of death, whether it's an unexplainable suicide or a baby being murdered over a diaper. None of it makes sense. Mike knows this, even though it's her job to try to impose order on the chaos of it all. But we humans, we look for patterns and meaning, often seeing those where they don't exist. As a reader, I kept expecting a neatly wrapped explanation for Jennifer's suicide. She was an astrophysicist - maybe she learned there was an asteroid hurtling toward the Earth that would wipe us all out anyway? I can't recall what other theories I entertained, but I thought there'd be one. In this sense, Amis turns noir fiction on its head. There is no solution to the puzzle, there is no sense, because that's how life is. That's how death is. It doesn't make sense, no matter how hard we try. (My corollary: And so isn't life really about the connections we make while we're here?)One more note -- I really loved the recurring imagery of the night train. It really added to the noir feel, as well as serving as a metaphor for death. The night train comes for us all sooner or later. (It's also really making me want to listen to Johnny Cash, for some reason. Alas, I have none in my CD collection. I feel a trip to Best Buy in my immediate future.)"}, {"userName": "Bex", "userReviewDate": "Aug 10, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3283584-bex", "userReview": "44-year-old female detective and recovering alcoholic, \"Mike\" Hoolihan, takes on the job of investigating the apparent suicide of Jennifer Rockwell, the only daughter of police brass, Colonel Tom. Tom is a powerful father figure for Mike: he saved her life by getting her off the booze. Now he wants her to explain what happened to his daughter. Jennifer had everything anybody wants: beauty, wit, health and a stimulating career. So the discovery in her orderly apartment of her naked body with three shots to the head strikes Hoolihan not just as a shock, but as an endlessly troubling mystery. As she attempts to solve it, Amis takes us down the well-worn paths of the traditional detective story: the crime scene, the autopsy, the interviews with Jennifer's doctor, lover and colleagues, mostly set in offices, bars and smoky police cells. The resolution is original while still remaining reasonably faithful to classic crime conventions. As Borges once observed, the American detective story is generally a disappointment precisely because its solutions don't satisfy the curiosity the plot has stirred. But Amis, to my mind, nails it. The ending is incredibly bleak and quite unexpected, though some readers will undoubtedly find it ambiguous... So much of the criticism of this startling little novel misses the mark by holding it to a standard it doesn't attempt to meet. The one thing we can be sure Amis is not doing here is attempting a conventional noirish crime novel. Rather, he borrows the conventions of one genre and uses them for something else: in this case, he takes the \"detective story\" as the narrative architecture for an existential drama, much like Paul Auster did in \"The New York Trilogy\". As \"a police\", Mike needs to be interested in the what and the how, and less in the why. But as Amis shows, the why is everything. The why is our central dilemma. I read \"Night Train\" in one sitting and enjoyed it immensely. I suspect the hatred it inspires has more to do with the average crime buff's disappointed expectations and/or the corrosive and now-automatic distaste many critics have for Martin Amis, and less to do with the book itself."}, {"userName": "Azumi", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/14024451-azumi", "userReview": "[\u00bfpor qu\u00e9 se mata Jennifer? \u00bfpor qu\u00e9 deja tantas pistas falsas? \u00bfcomo es que nadie nota lo deprimida que estaba? \u00bfest\u00e1 pensando Mike tambi\u00e9n en el suicidio? \u00bfpuede alguien realmente suicidarse peg\u00e1ndose 3 tiros????

Yes, it is a quick read, both short and engaging. But there is so much packed into it that not only did I have to reread the final 20 pages immediately upon finishing the book, I also had to go read all I could find about it on the internet, trying to understand what exactly happened. And I will definitely need to read it through again. Ostensibly Night Train is a straight up crime novel, narrated by a female \"police\" named Mike Hoolihan, who is given the task of investigating the suicide of a young woman named Jennifer Rockwell. Jennifer\u2019s father is Mike\u2019s boss, and neither Colonel Tom Rockwell nor Mike can truly believe that Jennifer, given her seemingly perfect life, would kill herself. So plot-wise, the novel follows Mike\u2019s findings faithfully. But that\u2019s just the surface layer, and underneath is so much more. Night Train is a meditation on identity, on suicide, on expectations; it\u2019s about appearance vs. reality, it\u2019s about the cosmos and humans\u2019 place in it; it\u2019s about love and family and secrets and lies.

At 175 pages, it\u2019s over before it starts. It gestures toward grand philosophical imponderables without really allowing them to impart any gravity or profundity. The police-procedural dimension, too, is entirely sketchy and insufficient. And our protag, Mike Hoolihan, is a blur: a woman with a man\u2019s name and a masculine manner, an American with peculiarly non-native habits of speech, a figure with some history--a past of trial and trauma--and profile, none of which condenses into even a broadly drawn human specimen.

Thus, you are left with an implausible scenario of a beautiful, happy, brilliant, loved, young, healthy woman inexplicably killing herself, by even more implausibly shooting herself in the head three times while sitting on a chair naked Not only that, we are supposed to believe that the detective assigned to investigate the suicide will have personally known the victim, her dad and pretty much everyone else involved in the story despite it allegedly taking place in a relatively large American city.

So it's no surprise that this tale of a recovering alcoholic detective investigating the apparent suicide of her boss the top cop's beautiful daughter (and there's even more baggage than that) winds up with the reader going \"Huh?\" Whatever. It is, I think, a rumination on life, death, the universe, despair, love, death, the beastliness of it all. It's just not much of a mystery."}, {"userName": "Stephanie", "userReviewDate": "Jan 10, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3953927-stephanie", "userReview": "I did not care for this book at all. The writing style was so awkward and choppy that it took away from the story. There were too many tangents, or thoughts spun off the narrative, that the whole thing read like noise to me. It also annoyed me that the protagonist was a woman named Mike--I mean, why? And other characters named Trader, and Hi, and Bex, and Arn Debs, it was all just annoying. If you're still reading, and are interested, the story is about Mike, a cop, sleuthing her way through the apparent suicide of a colleague/friend's daughter."}, {"userName": "Rita", "userReviewDate": "Jun 03, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27938812-rita", "userReview": "He dudado.

A fifteen-year veteran of the force, she's gone from walking a beat, to robbery, to homicide. But one case--this case--has gotten under her skin.When Jennifer Rockwell, darling of the community and daughter of a respected career cop--now top brass--takes her own life, no one is prepared to believe it. Especially her father, Colonel Tom. Homicide Detective Mike Hoolihan, longtime colleague and friend of Colonel Tom, is ready to \"put the case down.\" Suicide. Closed. Until Colonel Tom asks her to do the one thing any grieving father would ask: take a second look.Not since his celebrated novel Money has Amis turned his focus on America to such remarkable effect. Fusing brilliant wordplay with all the elements of a classic whodunit, Amis exposes a world where surfaces are suspect (no matter how perfect), where paranoia is justified (no matter how pervasive), and where power and pride are brought low by the hidden recesses of our humanity.", "title": "Night Train", "url": "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23040.Night_Train", "average": 3.23, "cover": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320541731l/23040.jpg", "reviews": 353, "authors": [{"url": "https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/11337.Martin_Amis", "name": "Martin Amis"}], "type": ["Fiction", "Mystery", "Mystery", "Contemporary", "European Literature"], "outlinks": ["http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23040.Night_Train", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4961058-il-treno-della-notte", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18284043-nakties-traukinys", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6306057-night-train", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1217015.Night_Train", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1188791.Night_Train", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/14061976-tren-nocturno", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8234569-o-comboio-da-noite", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/16140364-night-train", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18825.Money", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23031.Time_s_Arrow", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18830.London_Fields", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18828.The_Rachel_Papers", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18833.Dead_Babies", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39928984-mercy-among-the-children", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20620995-take-me-with-you", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6565401-five-quarters-of-the-orange", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25600623-the-diver-s-clothes-lie-empty", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18867378-the-traveler-s-gift", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198373-big-stone-gap", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40198387-friendship-bread", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193401-the-little-giant-of-aberdeen-county", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35963775-her-sister-s-shoes", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22617980-the-rock-harbor-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35269080-a-thousand-tomorrows", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204902-caravans", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31192689-shoeless-joe", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40204877-a-hero-of-france", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6473113-death-in-venice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40266651-the-tilted-world", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33117501-blonde", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36546758-ever-after", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40193580-rescue", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22032837-the-pearl-that-broke-its-shell", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36589911-the-lords-of-discipline", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11963271-the-sheltering-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25596951-the-dressmaker-s-war", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35120598-gena-finn", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29550710-a-charles-martin-collection", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19977229-remember-tuesday-morning", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8530701-a-town-like-alice", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35414455-the-other-alcott", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18800554-the-scavenger-s-daughters", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40205036-under-the-udala-trees", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32861105-the-streets-have-no-king", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39929534-the-passion", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35654710-this-dark-road-to-mercy", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11513574-breath-eyes-memory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/21942189-the-language-of-hoofbeats", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18165412-house-of-bathory", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37984397-we-own-the-sky", "http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36004055-not-perfect"]}
