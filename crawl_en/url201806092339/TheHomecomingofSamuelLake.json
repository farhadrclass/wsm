Samuel Lake usually leaves his wife Willadee and three children there while he runs to see what congregation he will be assigned to preach at for the coming year. This year Willadee's father dies and they find out that Sam has no flock to preach at. So they move in at the Willadee's mom's home. That happens to be a store and all night bar. The Lakes youngest child Swan is mostly the main character, but you come to know this whole family over the course of this book. Swan totally steals the show for me though, she is spunky and just the most perfect character. Plus, Swan knows that her uncle Toy is going to be her new best friend. He just doesn't know it yet. Toy is one of those haunted characters, he lost a leg during service, came home found out his wife was sleeping around, murdered her lover...you know..just an average guy. Don't think badly of him though. I adored him. His wife Bernice was Sam Lake's previous fianc\u00e9 before he met Willadee. She knows that she could have Sam back just like that so her planning starts.\nThen you have the evil man who lives next door. Ras Ballenger, who abuses his wife, son (Blade)and animals with gleeful abandon. (Be warned that there are some scenes that aren't pretty)You know throughout the book that some kind of evil is lurking but I wasn't sure if Bernice would bring it or that turd Ras. (Ras is that bad guy that will have you squeezing your book pages in your hands to keep from wanting to punch him in the face.)I'm totally crapping the bed on this review trying to get my point across so I'm just going to share a couple of the quotes. I totally loved this book.Preachers' kids are the worst kind.Nobody ever said the worst kind of what, but the implication was that all preachers' kids had illicit adventures, and Swan could never feel close to anyone who looked down on her for things she hadn't had a chance to do yet.The hard part about this plan was going to be coming up with a good enough lie to explain why she'd been where she'd been, but Swan had tremendous confidence in her lying ability. And if worst came to worst, she could always tell the truth.\nBooksource: library\nMy friend Cher's review did much better than I did on getting her feelings across for this little gem of a book."}, {"userName": "Dem", "userReviewDate": "Jul 05, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2752994-dem", "userReview": "Jenny Wingfield's debut novel The Homecoming of Samuel Lake is a real gem !Set in rural south Arkansas in the 1950s this story is about the Moses family and when good and evil cross paths and its consequences, but above all else it is about the love courage and struggle of a family and rural live. I loved the title of this Novel and was intrigued to see where this story was going and Jenny Winfield\u2019s tale really flows from the opening line . ( I really love a novel with a good opening line).\u201c John Moses couldn\u2019t have chosen a worse day, or a worse way to die, if he planned it for a lifetime\u201dSamuel Lake is a preacher who has lost his ministry and goes to live with his wife's family in rural Arkansas with their 3 children and the story unfolds from here and we spend the summer with the Moses family and go through happy sad and some cruel times with them. This is a character driven story and I loved watching those characters develop and come alive, I could feel their emotions throughout the read and I fell in love with Swan, I loved her courage and how she took Blade under her wing, I enjoyed the character of Willadee, such a good person and so quiet and yet so strong. I loved Toy for the way he watched out for the kids and the family and I could go on and on about all the wonderful ( and not so wonderful) characters in this book but think I will leave that for a bookclub discussion.This is one of those books that made me exclaim out loud, there is a lot of happy times and a lot of sad times throughout this story. Some people may even find this a tough read but it is a terrific story and a real page turner. Jenny Wingfield does not spend time on long descriptive passages she has a story to tell and she just gets on and tells it and what a great story it is.There is also wit in this Novel and I found myself underlining sentences as I was reading as they had me laughing out loud. I loved every single thing about The Homecoming of Samuel Lake, from the sweet Southern charm to the likable and dislikeable characters to the sense of time and place.This is certainly one for my favourites list."}, {"userName": "Florence (Lefty) MacIntosh", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/10856439-florence-lefty-macintosh", "userReview": "[Graphic descriptions of animal abuse.

From the title you might assume that it's just about Samuel Lake but it is about so much more - good and evil , darkness and joy , love and infidelity , caring and abuse , horrific deeds , and the loss of innocence of young children who witness evil before their very eyes and suffer at the hands of it. But yes , it is ultimately about Samuel Lake and how he discovers that he can \"tend to God's business \" as well as his family . It's also about a good man named Toy Moses , Samuel's brother in law , and my other favorite character in the novel whose actions reflect the true meaning of family .You can read the description or other reviews that tell more about the story. I'll just say that is one that I'm glad I didn't miss . It's gripping, heartbreaking but yet so hopeful. Highly recommended but not for the faint of heart .

Of miracles happening when one least expects it, especially for Sam Lake, a preacher who is without a pulpit and his faith beginning to wane; and his daughter, Swan Lake, who captures the innocence and purity that only a child can have.

Annually, Samuel Lake and his wife, Willadee Moses, head from Louisiana to the family reunion in Arkansas with their three children in tow. Samuel Lake is a good and loving husband to Willadee, a loving father to his children Noble, Swan and Bienville, a passionate preacher to his congregation.Samuel and Willadee\u2019s daughter, eleven year old Swan (yes, Swan Lake) is a spirited little girl, not afraid of much, and with a strong sense of right and wrong. Others have compared her to Scout Finch (To Kill a Mockingbird), and while this is a lovely and charming book with similar themes of justice, set in a small southern town, this book stands on its own merits. Swan really captured me, although each of the characters gets a fairly equal part in this story that centers around Swan\u2019s intention to save a young neighbor boy from his father\u2019s ways. Set in 1950\u2019s Arkansas with a cast of characters that in other hands might end up being too trite, Jenny Wingfield keeps each character from being overly predictable. \u201cThe Homecoming of Samuel Lake\u201d is Wingfield\u2019s debut novel. \u201cI was picking them for that man,\u201d he said softly, nodding toward the house. \u201cThat uncle.\u201d Calla tipped back her head and sucked air in through her nose, the way a person does when a feeling gets to be too much to handle.

Debut novelist Jenny Wingfield conjures a cast of characters fresh and imaginative \u2013 all set against the lush backdrop of a rural Arkansas farming landscape in the \u201850s.\u201cI think maybe miracles are something everybody has to find out about for themselves.\u201d This astute knowledge comes from one of the key characters, a likable, resilient pre-teen Swan, and gets to the heart of this story that focuses on the family struggles of an out-of-work preacher.Wingfield\u2019s narrative style \u2013 using an observant, omniscient point of view \u2013 allows the reader to explore a number of dark topics: manipulation, abuse, dishonesty, infidelity, animal cruelty. They are, however, tempered with countless laugh-out-loud moments, including (among others) the name of the grandfather\u2019s bar, \u201cMoses Never Closes.\u201d And of course, there is hope and love peppered throughout this story that follows the lives of four incredible, children, their parents, and aunts/uncles. And no story would be a good story without a villain; Wingfield delivers just that, a character named Ras, who is so despicable and abhorrent that he still gives me the shivers. (Warning: not an easy read for some).Perhaps I was drawn also by Wingfield\u2019s portrayal of religion; the revival scenes and even the thoughts of the preacher, Samuel, were reminiscent of the stories my mom tells of revivals in the \u201850s in her hometown of Pennsylvania. (For anyone shy of religion, this is not a book with a religious agenda. In fact, often the religion takes a back seat to other pivotal plot threads.)Even though this story has heartbreaking, heartbreaking elements, I think Wingfield expertly wove reality and hope into the story. The ending was not a \u201cperfect\u201d and \u201cwrapped in a bow,\u201d \u201ctidy\u201d ending (I personally love endings that aren't perfectly wrapped). But in so many ways it was a peaceful ending \u2013 a reminder that each of us must come to peace with our circumstances, whether they are good or bad.I\u2019m looking forward to more of Wingfield\u2019s work!"}, {"userName": "Crystal Craig", "userReviewDate": "May 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4729956-crystal-craig", "userReview": "Recommended Reading\nThe Homecoming of Samuel Lake is just one of those books you must read.

The characters, especially the children are fun.

I really loved it.I blew through this one in 2 days and loved it from the first paragraph. It's southern lit set in Arkansas in the 1950's, which does not have a romance-centric plot and does not focus on the overdone racial tropes. Can we please, please get more of these?? The author delicately balances the power of hope against a realistic portrayal of the cruelty in our world. Her characters are memorable and there are some great humorous moments. There are several characters that are incredibly endearing, another that you will absolutely love to hate (cough, homewrecker, cough), and another that is so cruel he will give you the heebie jeebies. Be forewarned that there is animal cruelty in this one, particularly towards horses and cats, but it was not so graphic that my tender heart could not stomach it. This is an easy novel to recommend, and I look forward to reading the author's next novel.-------------------------------------------------Favorite Quote: They\u2019d have people out looking for her, and nothing makes grown-ups quite so mad as finding a child safe when they\u2019d been scared silly that they might find that child dead.First Sentence: John Moses couldn\u2019t have chosen a worse day, or a worse way to die, if he\u2019d planned it for a lifetime."}, {"userName": "Bette Crosby", "userReviewDate": "Jan 25, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3329399-bette-crosby", "userReview": "Awesome book...loved the story, the pacing, the language.

I hadn't come across it before and it wasn't on my book radar at all. I opened it up to page 1 and fell in.In 1956, Samuel Lake takes his wife, Willadee, and his 3 kids to her family reunion at the old home place in Arkansas. The Moses family is big, rambunctious, noisy and loving, with a lot of history, resentment, jealousies and tragedy and joy among them, just like most families. And there's more in store as this novel takes off and sends the reader in so many different directions that it's almost impossible to put it down. The best thing about this book was that everything was so real. The characters were REAL, their conversations were REAL, the kids were REAL. There was humor mixed in with the sadness, hope mixed in with the really bad things that happened. Southern cooking was very much a part of this family, as was all the golden southern phrases that I remember from my childhood.This author brought these people to life and told a tale that had me spellbound for two days. Most of this book is filtered through the eyes of Swan, who gets my vote for the best 11 year old girl in the book world, outside of Scout Finch in To Kill a Mockingbird. She's sassy, honest, smart and brave, with a great big heart. No one stands a chance with her, once her mind is made up.I hope you'll give this book a chance, it deserves a wide readership.

To borrow words from The Homecoming of Samuel Lake ... it's \"enough to make your heart fill up and burst\"Jenny Wingfield's writing is pure bliss ... it's all warmth and honesty, it filled me with joy, tugged at my heart strings, made my face ache from smiling, it made me sigh and giggle and cry.

Swan did, too, she was sure, even though she bent His rules with some degree of regularity, and prayed only When It Was Important. She'd never been one to wear God out with small talk.Swan said, \"This means we're really poor, right?\"\"Not really poor. Really poor people don't have enough to eat, and can't afford to go to the doctor when they get sick. There's a difference between being poor and being prudent.\"Swan sighed. \"I don't suppose there's any way to know how long we'll be prudent is there? Because I'd sure hate to be prudent at Christmas.\"from Toy\"It's hard to believe, but there are people in this world who are low enough\" - he paused for emphasis - \"sorry enough\" - he paused again - \"pure pig shit worthless enough to maliciously harm a child.\"from Calla\"Did you know flowers bloom better if you pick them?\"He shook his head solemnly.\"Well, they do.

THE HOMECOMING OF SAMUEL LAKE. (2011). ***.\tThis first novel from this author who has several successful screenplays under her belt is likely destined to be a best seller. The reviews have all been glowing \u2013 to the point where the reader feels constrained to love the book, too. I thought it was capably written, but on the level of a YA novel told like Bible stories for children. It is the story of the Lake family from southern Arkansas. It starts out with the celebration of the annual family reunion. All the relatives are there to celebrate with the patriarch, John Moses, this annual fest. John, well on in years and filled with increasing doubt about his place in the world, is quickly gotten rid of when he commits suicide with the aid of a shotgun while the party is going on outside. The focus then shifts to his daughter, Willadee Moses \u2013 married to Samuel Lake, a Methodist preacher who is too far to the right for a permanent congregation \u2013 and her children, especially Swan, their daughter, a piece of work just about 12 years old. There are lots of standard characters included, all, it seems, pulled from Central Casting. The conflict between good and evil is exemplified by the interaction between the Moses/Lake families and their neighbors \u2013 including a sadistic father who beats his kids, kills cats on a routine basis, and trains horses using a whip. As you read on, you can\u2019t help but think of the Tales of Uncle Remus, not that Uncle Remus is there, but the style of Joel Chandler Harris is there. The novel is a collection of fables, each of which ends up with the requisite moral, while leading into the next series of tales about the adventures of these southern families. Interesting reading, but \u2013 in my opinion \u2013 highly overrated in the reviews I\u2019ve read."}, {"userName": "\u262eKaren", "userReviewDate": "Dec 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1076079-karen", "userReview": "I love this book and this author.

While Grandma Calla runs a general store by day in the front of the house, Uncle Toy runs an all night bar at the back, and Samuel himself holds a nightly tent revival in a neighboring field, the three Lake children, most notably feisty eleven year old Swan, are learning what it's like to come of age as goodness and evil play tug of war around them. The evil comes mostly in the form of a neighbor who mistreats his wife, children, and animals, and who carries a grudge towards the Moses clan when they try to intervene. Parts of this book are difficult to read. This is an emotional bittersweet tale of sin, redemption, justice, dishonesty, honesty, and even miracles.

Moreover, it\u2019s about family and friendship and the unifying power of unconditional love \u2013 a love so strong it can weather any storm. And storms come in all shapes and sizes, some born of the natural world and some are devilishly man-made. \u201cThere are moments in our lives that we more or less stumble upon \u2013 moments that we could not have predicted, and we\u2019re not prepared for, and would have done almost anything to avoid . . .\u201d\u201cThe Homecoming of Samuel Lake\u201d taps into many genres: Family, Coming-of-age, Suspense, Southern-fiction, Drama-noir, Faith-based-fiction\u2026. It also deviates a bit from standard linear storytelling. In a figurative way, the title is quite fitting. The story, told from various viewpoints, is not centered on Samuel Lake, per se, but rather, events encompassing him and his family when they are forced to move back to their hometown in Arkansas after being ousted from a preaching assignment in Louisiana to take a mandatory year sabbatical. \u201cChurch members are funny . . .

But when his only daughter, Swan (my favorite character, who I dearly loved and easily identified with) gets entangled in a tug-and-war match between good and evil (an evil so sinister and brutal, it\u2019s hard to fathom let alone speak of) Samuel comes undone. Broken. Shattered. Over the edge. Crushed. Sometimes though, it takes being devastatingly broken to be made whole in a glorious way that wouldn't have been possible otherwise.\"Sometimes a sense of loss can be so great that anyone who offers comfort seems to be making small of it.\"Aside from extreme creative liberties taken concerning Blue Laws in 1957 Arkansas, and the Sheriff being so lackadaisical regarding the law with the exception at the end, I passionately enjoyed this novel.

Set in the 1950\u2019s Arkansas this story has a little of everything - romance, murder, compassion, cruelty and the value of family. The characters are all lively and especially the children were a delight. We have righteous Samuel, strong-willed Willadee, scheming Bernice, lively Swan, reserved Toy and of course young Blade who will crawl into anyone\u2019s heart.The story has a few sub plots but for me it really revolved around Swan Lake and her new friend Blade Ballenger.

The majority of characters were also presented as either very good or very bad with nothing in between.But ultimately this was a compulsively readable story that is meant to warm your heart and leave you feeling happy afterwards so go make a big pot of tea, put your feet up and enjoy."}, {"userName": "Imi", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3126915-imi", "userReview": "[committed on children including the rape at the end (hide spoiler)]"}, {"userName": "\u2615Laura", "userReviewDate": "Apr 08, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15033381-laura", "userReview": "As I started reading this book I thought it was going to be one thing and then, boom, it was another thing entirely. I love a book which can take me by surprise like that. Based on the first couple of chapters I was expecting an enjoyable but somewhat light-hearted quirky-characters-in-a-large-southern-family type of story. What I was not expecting were the dark themes which would later emerge: suicide, abuse, murder, incarnate evil. What is truly masterful is the way Jenny Wingfield manages to imbue her novel with a sense of hopefulness despite all of this. In the end, this book is about love, faith, and the power of family. This book is a journey, by turns sad and beautiful, horrifying and joyous, but at all times wonderful."}, {"userName": "Ruth Turner", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17861817-ruth-turner", "userReview": "I loved it, from beginning to end.Although this story deals with the disturbing issues of child abuse and animal abuse, it is still a wonderful read.

Samuel Lake is a Methodist preacher who is moved around in the South from parish to parish with his family, (they have two sons and a daughter, until one year, a parish is not offered to Samuel. They return to Calla and John Moses's home with their children.I really wanted to love this story. The author is the screenwriter for one of the most tear jerking movies of all (my) time, The Man in the Moon(1991), Reese Witherspoon's first movie. This is a similar setting: times are simpler, people are more down to earth, there is no television or internet. The Lake family children are playful and well adjusted, particularly Swan, the only girl. This was pretty much my biggest problem in the novel, but there were a few. While the title of the book leads you to believe this book is going to be about Samuel lake, the first third of the book seems to be about Swan Lake, and her antics and adventures. several new characters are introduced, and while I understand you need minor characters, the author seems to delve into details about these minor characters, and creates tiny little plot diversions that pretty much go nowhere.There are so many different tentacles to the plot, I began to wonder what this novel was really about. Was it about the spiritual failings of a pastor and family man, his daughter and her struggle for identity? Or his brother in law Toy, a disabled WW2 vet with a beautiful yet unfaithful wife, with her eye on Sam? Calla, Willadee's mother who is widowed by her husband's suicide right at the start of the book? Blade, the abused neighbor boy who is nearly murdered by his sadistic father? There were just too many plot lines to feel like I was getting to know these characters, the story jumped about. About 50 pages before the end of the novel, I wondered why I was even reading it any longer. But after about 30 of those pages, the plot takes a final turn that grabbed me and pulled me in and made me cry. It pulled together several of those characters and united those plot lines. This book had some really wonderful things going for it. But the possible Mockingbird small-town feel without the wise characters didn't work. Justice turns a blind eye in this novel (there is murder, rape domestic abuse and child abuse, almost all of which goes without prosecution). Samuel Lake is no Atticus Finch, Swan, not quite a Scout. The conclusion of the novel is almost spectacular, and there were many great ideas there for other themes in the book; redemption, sacrifice, faith and miracles. But somehow, for the first 8/10ths of the book, there was nor real central unifying theme.I like this novel, I just heartily wish it was better. Perhaps a little more editing and paring down of the length of the story as well would have worked. I don't think I'll be recommending this book to friends."}, {"userName": "Louise", "userReviewDate": "Aug 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2143983-louise", "userReview": "I absolutely loved this book and couldn\u2019t put it down. For a debut novel, Jenny Wingfield has penned a winner!The story opens in Columbia County, Arkansas, in 1956. The entire extended Moses clan have gathered for their annual reunion. John and Calla Moses have been hosting this reunion for years. The majority of family members live close-by with the exception of John and Calla\u2019s daughter, Willadee, who lives down in Louisianna. She is married to Samuel Lake, a preacher of the Methodist religion which does not sit well with old John. He sees the Methodists as: \u201c\u2026the vilest bunch of bandits alive\u201d. Samuel and Willadee have three children: twelve-year-old Noble, nine-year-old Bienville, and eleven-year-old Swan Lake.\u201d Three precocious children who were adept at keeping themselves entertained playing war games and spying on people.Calla ran a store from the front of the house where folks could purchase the staples of everyday life. Her store was open from dawn to dusk. John, not one to be outdone, opened a bar at the back of the house and was open dusk to dawn with a sign that said: \u201cMoses Never Closes\u201d.The family reunion is going along fine until tragedy strikes throwing the family into chaos. Although the rural setting appears picturesque, there are many failings in the characters.Swan Lake is an absolute fearless eleven-year-old and was compared to Scout in the movie \u2018To Kill a Mockingbird\u2019. Although fearless she is chocked full of kindness, generosity and love. Her eight-year-old neighbour, Blade Ballenger is a character that you are totally going to fall in love with and if you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ll be rooting for someone to save him from his horrifying father and indifferent mother.This is an emotionally charged book that, at one point, had me sobbing like a baby! I could easily see this novel becoming a classic someday.

This is a marvelous read.This is a beautifully written debut novel. Ms. Wingfield is also a screenwriter and this would make a great film so I\u2019ll keep watching for that!The title character is a very committed young preacher who loses his job and the only option is to move his wife and their three children to her family\u2019s farm in Arkansas. The Moses\u2019 farm is no longer a farm, but has been turned into a general store and an all night bar. The novel begins in June when the Moses family always has their reunion. When tragedy strikes at the reunion, the consequences create crisis and profound change in everything.One of the most memorable characters is, of course, Samuel\u2019s eleven year old daughter, Swan (Swan Lake?) whose delightful spirit and fearlessness makes her a bright shining star. In many reviews she is positively compared to the character of Scout in TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD. I heartily agree with this comparison and she may be the new standard character for the new generation. Swan becomes a champion and a refuge for a much abused child, and is to be applauded for her bravery.And I have to say my most memorable character was Toy, the brother married to a shrew and madly in love with her. Despite this blind spot, he becomes very loveable, dependable, empathic and extremely heroic. I fell in love with him and rued his sacrifice.This captivating plot is so much more than I have written, but is a glimpse into a wonderful novel that is Southern gothic at its finest! The families dynamics are so well represented you feel a part of them and their emotions, which is one of the reasons it is so hard to put the book down.THE HOMECOMING OF SAMUEL LAKE is a bittersweet inspirational novel capturing the disappointments, the redemption, the good versus evil, the faith and the forgiveness of an enchanting cast of characters and a memorable novel.Highly Recommended"}], "description": "Every first Sunday in June, members of the Moses clan gather for an annual reunion at \u201cthe old home place,\u201d a sprawling hundred-acre farm in Arkansas. And every year, Samuel Lake, a vibrant and committed young preacher, brings his beloved wife, Willadee Moses, and their three children back for the festivities. The children embrace the reunion as a welcome escape from the prying eyes of their father\u2019s congregation; for Willadee it\u2019s a precious opportunity to spend time with her mother and father, Calla and John. But just as the reunion is getting under way, tragedy strikes, jolting the family to their core: John\u2019s untimely death and, soon after, the loss of Samuel\u2019s parish, which set the stage for a summer of crisis and profound change.In the midst of it all, Samuel and Willadee\u2019s outspoken eleven-year-old daughter, Swan, is a bright light. Her high spirits and fearlessness have alternately seduced and bedeviled three generations of the family. But it is Blade Ballenger, a traumatized eight-year-old neighbor, who soon captures Swan\u2019s undivided attention. Full of righteous anger, and innocent of the peril facing her and those she loves, Swan makes it her mission to keep the boy safe from his terrifying father.With characters who spring to life as vividly as if they were members of one\u2019s own family, and with the clear-eyed wisdom that illuminates the most tragic\u2014and triumphant\u2014aspects of human nature, Jenny Wingfield emerges as one of the most vital, engaging storytellers writing today.
