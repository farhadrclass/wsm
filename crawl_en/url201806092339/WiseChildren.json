The stories, street wisdom, wise-cracking, jokes and double entendres just pour out of her endlessly.I've met this kind of woman before, at cocktail parties, a long time ago. If you enjoy flirtation, nobody in the room could possibly be more flirtworthy. (I don't mean flirtation in any way other than the sheer pleasure of good company and good conversation.)At first, you approach them tentatively and gently, as if they might be quaint, thinking they'll only last one martini, and they'll want or need to catch a cab home. Then you realise that, as the twinkle surfaces and remains in their eye, they can handle their liquor better than you. They're the life of the party, not you. They're the speaker, you're just the listener. They're the author, you're just the reader.They've had more practice, and besides, they have more and better stories to tell than you. Slowly, drink by drink, they better you. Without doubt, they've met better men than you, too. They might forget you, but you will never forget them.I used to live next to two twins like this. We used to attend monthly Art Gallery functions, when the Gallery still paid for drinks and hors d'oeuvres. We always caught a cab home together, if I could handle the pace. Brush Up on Your ShakespeareAt another level, this novel is an extremely sophisticated project. Its five chapters function like a five act play. It appropriates themes and tropes from just about every Shakespearean play in existence (except perhaps two?).It really is an exercise that proves, if you brush up on your Shakespeare, you can achieve something breathtaking and remarkable. Well, at least Angela Carter could.Shakespeare is the foundation upon which the novel is built. Well, his theatre is. As we fast-forward into the present, Dora reveals to us her life in theatre, music hall, song and dance, and ultimately film of the Hollywood variety.Dora proves that all the world's a stage. I don't really know to whom the stage belonged in Shakespeare's age. It wasn't just Shakespeare and Co. However, increasingly, entertainment has been taken over by the supposed deal makers. The playwrights have been pushed into the background, as have the actors and actresses. In a way, Dora/Angela asserts the value of the person, the storyteller, the actor, the one who gets up on stage, the one who acts the part, the one who acts a goat, the one who entertains.Doesn't Feel like I'm Fixin' to Die RagAs narrated by a 75 year old woman, you have to wonder whether this is all nostalgia, a requiem for a time that has passed.Yet Carter's prose beats with the biggest heart you can conceive. This is no \"feels like I'm fixin' to die rag\".This is a tale told by someone who is determined to eke the most out of their life until the very last heartbeat.What a Joy It Is!I could tell you about the difference between a Hazard and a Chance. I could tell you that Dora has an identical twin, Nora, and I could tell you about all of the other twins and all of the scope for mistaken identity that this creates, not to mention the uncertainty about paternity (and maternity, believe it or not).But what I really want to tell you about is the joy that runs through this novel, these five chapters, like a river.\"So Long as Men Can Breathe, or Eyes Can See, So Long Lives This, and This Gives Life to Thee\"After all is said and done, Dora proclaims:\"What a joy it is to dance and sing!\"She's right, of course. If you make the effort to dance and sing.But isn't that what life is about?When you read that last sentence, you look back on the novel in its entirety and you marvel at the effort that went into it. The effort that was required to be precisely this hilarious, this vulgar, this witty, this dynamic, this wise.It's OK for a writer to be praised for the quality of their sentences. But here is someone who writes great sentences, great paragraphs, great chapters, great novels.Angela Carter never relaxes the pressure on herself in this novel. Only the best will do.Then you realise that for almost the whole time she was writing this novel, she knew that she had lung cancer and that it would take her life within 12 months.There isn't one iota of self-pity in this novel. It asserts that tragedy is something that happens to other people (even if comedy might also be a tragedy that happens to someone else).But most importantly, it asserts that tragedy isn't so much a life that ends (for this happens to us all), but a life that is wasted.Angela Carter wrote to the very end, partly so that her two sons might have a better life, but so that we might too.Ironically, or perhaps not, both Shakespeare and Carter died around the time of their 52nd birthdays."}, {"userName": "Cecily", "userReviewDate": "May 05, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1199525-cecily", "userReview": "This is a gloriously ribald carnivalesque adventure, with deeper themes. It is the life story of identical twin musical hall performers, Dora and (Leo)Nora and their complex family, as remembered by Dora on their 75th birthday. Dora is a wonderful raconteur, though hardly a reliable narrator. She's more of a chatty old biddy, rambling away, enthusiastically, and suddenly remembering little asides. She would be great fun to meet, and I really felt I did.There are many twins in the story: contrasts, duality, uniqueness, and mistaken identity are the most obvious themes, all in a theatrical setting, with many Shakespearean references.THEMESAs well as duality/twins (and related themes) and the theatre, uncertain parentage, absent fathers, decline and fall, comedy and tragedy, all feature strongly, and in fact most of them come back to duality and contrast. The performers range from the most revered Shakespearean thespians down to presenters on the trashiest sort of TV game show.Twinship sometimes reduces a pair to a single entity, but also enhances to more than the sum of its parts: \"Neither of us is anything special on our own... but put us together, people blinked... we turned heads.\" The trouble is, \"This night of all nights I wanted to look like myself, whoever that was.\"There are even similarities among those who are not twins, the same circumstances and actions recurring: romances arising from productions of King Lear, consensual incest (actual, presumed (but not certain, where paternity is not definite), and fictional (Lear and Cordelia, a pantomime goose and its gosling!)), and \"to die for love runs in the family\" - as does being long-lived (another contrast/contradiction).Legitimacy and illegitimacy is another aspect, both in the literal sense of people's parentage, but also in terms of \"proper\" theatre versus lower forms of entertainment. Randolph, the patriarch, toured the world, evangelising Shakespeare, to the point where \"the touring was turning into a kind of madness\".Performance is the background of everything, even real life: Grandma Chance's boarding house - on Bard Road \"never looked plausible. It looked like a stage set of a boarding house, as if Grandma had done it up to suite a role she'd chosen on purpose\", which was almost true. She even created her family out of scraps.Fate is a strong thread, too, even in the main surnames, Hazard and Chance. \"Ambition, the curse and glory of the Hazards, who'll risk everything they've got and a little bit more on a throw of the dice.\"If you like spotting such things, also look out for mirrors, the grandfather's Grandfather clock (and indirect references, e.g. \"we stopped, short...\" re the menopause!), Shakespearean-style potions and poisons, and Melchior's obsessive attachment to a cardboard crown.FAMILY TREEThis is rather complicated, as there are lots of twins, as well as partner-swapping, resulting in children being raised by their uncles. Other children, including Dora and Nora, are raised by people who are not their parents or uncles. There is a Dramatis Personae listed at the back, but this family tree is more useful:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Wis...The title becomes clear towards, the end, \"I may never have known my father in the sense of an intimate acquaintance, but I know who he was. I was a wise child.\"INCESTThis should be a troubling issue, but it's all glossed over in such a jolly way (no gory details), it's hard to be as outraged as one should be. Just the thought of it makes one character say, \"Dread and delight coursed through my veins\".TRUTHParts of it are a little far-fetched, but whether that's Angela Carter's fantasy, or embroidered by Dora, we don't always know, though at times, doubts are explicit: \"Over the years, Perry offered us a Chinese banquet of options as to what happened to him. He gave us all his histories, we could choose which ones we wanted - but they kept on changing.\" Another time, she admits, \"I always misremember. It never seems the same twice, each time that I remember it, it distorts.\"Similarly, \"Grandma invented this family. She put it together out of whatever came to hand... she created it out of sheer force of personality.\"There is a scene where a comedian tells an old joke about multiple illegitimacy (http://goodriddlesnow.com/jokes/view/...), but it becomes a rather meta joke within the novel, as the fiction has so many parallels in the story. The conclusion is that children invent their own histories, and Nora wonders if much of their own memory (especially of Peregrine) is \"just a collection of our hopes and dreams... Something to set our lives by, like the old [grandfather] clock in the hall.\"ALL THE WORLD'S A STAGEFor their seventh birthday, Dora and Nora are given a beautiful toy theatre, and Dora comments (perhaps only with hindsight) that it's \"just like life\". They, like another pair of twins in the story, were born on Shakespeare's birthday.\"The priest and the game-show presenter. Not so different... Both of them in show business. Both, in their different ways, carrying on the great tradition of the Hazard family - the willing suspension of disbelief. Both of them promise you a free gift if you play the game.\"\"I... have always loved it best of all, the moment when the lights go down, the curtain glows, you know that something wonderful is going to happen. It doesn't matter if what happens next spoils everything: the anticipation itself is always pure.\"When one pair of twins meet their real father, he denies parentage by quoting the Bard - ouch!Dora describes the experience of watching film of her and Nora in their youth as \"batty old tarts with their eyes glued on their own ghosts... When I was young, I'd wanted to be ephemeral... to live on just the glorious moment... But if you put your past on celluloid, it keeps.\"FAVOURITE QUOTES* \"The habit of applying warpaint outlasts the battle.\"* \"He loved his boys [who may not have been his].

By chance it is also her last novel. A fitting swan song for the master enchanter, conjuring wonders out of her magic pen for the last time, guiding me again by the light of a Paper Moon into world of entertainment. After joining the circus in the company of a winged trapeze artist in Nights at the Circus, it's the turn now of Dora and Nora Chance to be the hosts of a wild ride through almost a century of popular entertainment. They are twin illegitimate daughters of the greatest Shakespearen family in the English Theatre, the Hazards. Being from the wrong side of the tracks (literally from the South Bank of the Thames), their career develops in the 'bastard' scion of the art : the Vaudeville. Foul mouthed, gin infused and outrageously libertine, Dora Chance on her 75 year birthday recounts the tumultous history of the family, starting with their grandparents and going through several pair of twins in each Hazard generation. Prepare to be shocked out of your socks and to laugh until you cry your eyes out. Well, you might have known what you were about to let yourself in for when you let Dora Chance in her ratty old fur and poster paint, her orange (Persian Melon) toenails sticking out of her snakeskin peep-toes, reeking of liquor, accost you in the Coach and Horses and let her tell you a tale. The whole journey takes place under the auspices of The Bard : the grandparents toured the world as a Shakespearean company, Melchior and Peregrine Hazard, as well as the Chance twins are born on the same day as Shakespeare. Melchior would achieve his world wide fame playing dramatic roles from the Bard's repertoire, and later in the novel the whole family would move to Hollywood to film  A Midsummer Night Dream . This reference is not a coincidence, as the whole book is a manifesto against artificial divisions of entertainment between high- and low-brow, be it theathe, literature, music or cinema. Shakespeare is the perfect master of both the comedy and the tragedy that is life, indivisibly and irrepressibly bursting out of the restraints of conventions and categorizations.Dora and Nora Chance are raised in poverty by their grandmother, unacknowledged by their sire Melchior, but supported from a distance by their wandering uncle, his twin Perry. Their fate is sealed on their seventh birthday, as they are treated to a night out at the theatre. They see a performance of Lady Be Good and afterwards the Grandmother exclaims:  \"You've got stars in your eyes, girls\"  All they want to do from now on is to get up and dance. They will take lessons, and start earning money as chorus girls in their early teens, but that first magic moment will be cherished forever in their pit-pating hearts: The lights went down, the bottom of the curtain glowed. I loved it and have always loved it best of all, the moment when the light go down, the curtain glows, you know that something wonderful is going to happen. It doesn't matter if what happens next spoils everything; the anticipation itself is always pure. To travel hopefully is better than to arrive. Their career is anything but a bed of roses, with two world wars to get through and the degradation of the vaudeville scene into nude peeping shows in later years. But throughout their tribulations they stood shoulder to shoulder and kicked their heels high and the air, laughed at the troubles and sang out their songs as loud as they could: She said \"Yes!\" to life and I said, \"Maybe!\" but whe're both in the same boat, now. Two batty old hags, buy us a drink and we'll sing you a song. Even manage a knees-up, on occasion, such as New Year's Eve or a publican's grandbaby.What a joy it is to dance and sing! One thing you can be sure of: nobody will say the Chance twins will go gently into that good night. And neither will Angela Carter, who remains in my heart a rebel and a fighter, cheerfully demolishing stuffy historical figures and dusty moralities in thinly veiled references to Lewis Carroll (Not many people can boast a photo of their grandmother posing for kiddiporn), Lawrence Olivier, Charlie Chaplin, a Certain Distinguished Person from the Royal Family, F Scott Fitzgerald (I read on wikipedia that he is the inspiration for Irish), Fred Astaire, Hollywood moguls and divas, TV presenters and venerable lords of the theatre. TV game shows are Simplicity itself. It's all about greed. The camera lingers on the faces in the audience, their eyes are popping out, they're drooling and slobbering. Money! Money for nothing! A win on Tristram Hazard's 'Lashings of Lolly', almost as good as a Civil List pension. Coming back to the twins in the family and the best Shakespearean tradition of mistaken identities, switching places and shady parenting, every Hazard / Chance generation recreates the dialectics of entertainment: tragedy and comedy, Carnegie Hall and Las Vegas, meditation and escapism, marriage and adultery, poetry and doggerel, chalk and cheese. Each twin is not a carbon copy of the other:- Melchior is King Lear and Hamlet, Perregrine is Falstaff traipsing around the world and hunting for butterflies in the Amazonian jungle;- Nora falls in love at the drop of a pin, Dora guards her heart fiercely;- Saskia is a famous TV chef, her sister Imogen is famous for her role as a goldfish in a children's programme;- Tristram is a game show presenter, his brother Gareth a Jesuit priest ( Not so different, really, I suppose. Both of them in show business. quips Dora)And none of them is actually certain who his/her parents are. That's where the title of the novel comes from (It's a wise child that knows its own father, hissed Peregrine, like the gypsy's warning. But wiser yet the father who knows his own child.), and the whole argument Carter makes in here that we should love life fully, unrestrained by moral prejudices, envy, greed, timidity. In the end: all is laughter, forgiveness, generosity, reconciliation just as the Bard taught us four centuries ago.----I've got a couple more quotes that I couldn't fit in without repeating myself , but I'll add them here because I would hate to misplace them later: Tragedy, eternally more class than comedy. How could mere song-and-dance girls aspire so high? We were destined from birth to be the lovely ephemera of the theatre, we'd rise and shine like birthday candles, then blow out. ---when Dora advises the American Star Daisy to lie to her producer husband:  Such moral horror as suffused her features! You never saw anything like it. We were quite surprised and felt shoddy, by comparison, as if we lived in an ethical twilight, a cockroach world of compromise, lies, emotional sleight of hand. And so we did, I suppose. We called it \"Life\". But Daisy wanted something better. So did Irish, come to think of it. It's the American tragedy in a nutshell. They look around the world and think: \"There must be something better!\" But there isn't. Sorry, chum. This is it. What you see is what you get. Only the here and now. ---Irish is Dora's elderly playwright boyfriend in Hollywood:  Poor old Irish. I gave him all a girl can give - a little pleasure, a little pain, a carillon of laughter, a kerchief full of tears. And, as for him, well, he gave me the ability to compose such a sentence as that last one. Don't knock it. That's lyricism. ---from Grandma, a lesson to last a lifetime:  Come off it girls! Pluck the day! You ain't dead, yet! You've got a party to go to!

And all of the links back to Melchior Hazard, Shakespearean actor, made me think of Station Eleven! But Carter definitely makes this tale all her own, despite the echoes with other authors.Like the Shakespeare that permeates the novel, there are lots of twins, sudden changes in fortune, costumes, and a lot of uncertain parentage. As the old saw goes, it\u2019s a wise child that knows its own father. Dora Chance, Melchior\u2019s illegitimate daughter and twin to Nora Chance, tells the tale and it unrolls like an article in a gossip rag. Whether you can trust all she says or not is a Chance that you\u2019ll have to take! The Lucky Chances, as the sisters are known, can only be considered lucky in comparison to others in the tale. For instance, they were raised by a woman who seemed to actually care about them, rather than by their biological parents and in this, they seem to come out ahead.Dora and Nora sound like they would be a lot of fun to have a gin and tonic with, but I wouldn\u2019t want to stay in their house!"}, {"userName": "Elizabeth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 28, 2009", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2226946-elizabeth", "userReview": "Oh, why did it take me so long to read this? Books like this one, sitting on my shelves gathering dust because I once thought they sounded interesting enough to buy, but then never got around to reading them, are exactly why I am undertaking this project and reading the books that I have instead of buying anything new.I loved this book a lot, obviously. It\u2019s the kind of book I want to read again for fun, but it also makes me want to go back to school, to read or reread all of Shakespeare (I am limiting myself to The Winter\u2019s Tale for now), to go back and read some Bakhtin.This is a novel about the theater, about the romance of family (blood ties and created families alike), about fathers and daughters, about the \u201chypothesis\u201d of fatherhood and the effects of its denial, about Shakespeare, about bastard children and lost heirs and endless sets of twins (I think there are five sets of twins, all told). Dora Chance, an identical twin and a bastard child and an elderly woman, looks back on her life as a song-and-dance girl on the wrong side of a great theater family that has fallen on hard times, artistically speaking: they now do margarine commercials, game shows, and cooking shows. Shakespearean plots and illusions repeat all through the novel and are sometimes consciously evoked by Dora, and sometimes appear under the surface.The story is nominally about fathers and daughters and the claiming of paternity, right down to the title: the proverb reads, \u201cIt is a wise child that knows its own father,\u201d but Shakespeare turned it around to, \u201cIt is a wise father that knows his own child,\u201d in The Merchant of Venice, and in this novel the knowing and not knowing definitely goes hand in hand with wisdom, on both sides of the parental equation. And Carter opens the novel with a quotation: \u201cHow many times Shakespeare draws fathers and daughters, never mothers and daughters.\u201dBut I think the novel is about mothers. The absent mother, dead in childbirth or murdered by the father, the adopted caretakers, the grandmothers, the stepmothers, the nanny. Fathers are both larger than life and entirely elusive here, but mothers are everywhere. They crawl out of the woodwork to fill in the gaps Shakespeare left, while the \u201cwise children\u201d are so focused on fathers that they take for granted the mothers all around them. A quote from near the end: \"\u2018Nora \u2026 don\u2019t you think our father looked two-dimensional, tonight?\u2019 \"She gave me a look that said, tell me more. \"\u2018Too kind, too handsome, too repentant. After all those years without a word. Remember that terrible bank holiday when he pretended to our faces that he thought we were Perry\u2019s? And tonight, he had an imitation look, even when he was crying, especially when he was crying, like one of those great, big, papier-mach\u00e9 heads they have in the Notting Hill parade, larger than life, but not lifelike.\u2019 \"Nora sunk in thought for a hundred yards. \"\u2018D\u2019you know, I sometimes wonder if we haven\u2019t been making him up all along,\u2019 she said. \u2018If he isn\u2019t just a collection of our hopes and dreams and wishful thinking in the afternoons. Something to set our lives by, like the old clock in the hall, which is real enough, in itself, but which we\u2019ve got to wind up to make it go.\u2019\"And on top of all of that, Wise Children is raunchy and very, very funny.

I read two of her novels deep in the middle of a hyper-anxious era that rattled me so badly that I barely remember anything I read that whole year (I promise you, \"Magic Toyshop\", I will come back!) and I'm afraid it has tainted my enthusiam for her other books. I have to thank Cecily for writing an enthusiatic review of \"Wise Children\" that got me dusting off the used copy that had been patiently waiting on my shelf\u2026 I now feel silly for neglecting \"Wise Children\" all this time: Shakespeare, musical theater acts and convoluted family history are like literary catnip to me. I have a viceral and romantic attraction to any story that could have a grinder organ soundtrack, the more sequins and greasepaint, the better!Dora Chance has that dirty old lady voice that I aspire to have when my seventy-fifth birthday rolls around (although anyone who hangs out with me over a few glasses of pinot noir might tell you I already sound exactly like that\u2026). She is a rambling, passionate, self-depricating story-teller who spins a colorful, topsy-turvy yarn. You might be tempted to call her an unreliable narrator but history has a way of being so much stranger than fiction\u2026 Its useless to try and summarize the Chance sisters' story but I will tell you about the aspects of it that really stayed with me.Duality is explored in so many ways in this novel. Obviously, there is a rather improbable amount of twins running around, all of which have personalities that oppose each other. The introvert and the extrovert, the man of the cloth and the game show host, the refined Shakespearean actor and the stage magician. But there are also two sides to the river Thames - in this story's context, it is about being born on the \"bad\" (read: poor) side of the river. The legitimacy of acts such as classical theater vs. the Vaudeville and other such low-brow forms of entertainement. But do those extremes not complement each other? Isn't that the constant balancing act of life?Another important theme is that of nostalgia. Dora is telling us this story on her seventy-fifth birthday, which happens to be her father's hundreth's birthday. She looks back at a world that has all but completely vanished. There is something sad about Dora and Nora being aged biddies, living with their sort-of-stepmother and having very little to do with themselves. It is tempting to live in one's memory of good times gone but it ain't over 'til the fat lady sings, as they say - and the ending will give them a lovely second wind.The theme of absent fathers struck a chord with me: my father left my mom when I was too young to appreciate that it was the right choice for everyone, but even before they separated, he wasn't around much. He's tried to make amends since, but you don't teach an old dog new tricks, and in many ways, Melchior reminded me of him. Dad never went as far as to pretend my siblings and I weren't his, but the serial deranged marriages are a speciality of his\u2026The only thing I am really unhappy about with this book, is that it isn't longer. I would have wanted to listen to Dora's stories for another hundred pages. But despite this flaw, this lovely bittersweet book made me giggle and sigh, and what else can you ask from a dirty old lady?"}, {"userName": "Nandakishore Varma", "userReviewDate": "Feb 12, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6237864-nandakishore-varma", "userReview": "I love Angela Carter's prose: the sentences dance together, perfectly matched, creating a sinuous harmony of prose that's almost poetry. Wise Children is no different. In telling the story of the Misses Dora and Leonora Chance, the \"Chance Sisters\" whose rhythmically clicking heels have lighted up many a music hall stage, Ms. Carter has not spared any expense, choosing to spread the paint in loud, garish brushstrokes. For are they not the twin daughters (albeit born on the other side of the blanket) of the great Shakespearean actor Melchior Hazard?Dora tells the story-and does it in such a bawdy style reminiscent of the music hall that you get carried away. It is a wildly improbable story, full of clandestine affairs, terrible disasters and great revelations-yet somehow unreal, as though we are watching a burlesque play. The girls are bastards of the great Melchior, born during the first world war, abandoned by their mother and brought up by Grandma Chance and their father's twin brother Peregrine. Even though their father do not accept them publicly, their story is always entwined with the story of the Hazard family, as Melchior moves from the drama stage to Hollywood and back again, picking up three and discarding two wives in the process. He has twin daughters from his first wife and twin sons from his third, and they all interact in wildly improbable ways throughout this kaleidoscopic novel.It would not make any sense to describe the plot, so I will not attempt it-even if I were able to do so! Suffice it to say that there are artifices and deceptions aplenty, and nothing is what it seems to be...rather like a Shakespear play... In fact, the spirit of the great bard, especially the bawdiness of his comedies, is present throughout the narrative. This novel could be Angela Carter's tribute to him. Also, the vulgar light of the music hall makes itself felt on each page.This is show business, and after some time, we start asking ourselves: is anything for real? As Nora asks Dora towards the end-does their father really exist? Or is he a pasteboard creation of their imaginations?The other persistent theme is that of twins. One active, one passive: one quiet, one sprightly: one good, one evil... Even the city of London, split by the river into \"twins\": the North, respectable and the South, vulgar. Diametrical opposites permanently linked together. The novel aptly ends with the arrival of a new set of twins.The question then arises: for such a many-layered story, why only three stars? Well...the book had a bit too much of vulgarity in it for me. Maybe Ms. Carter did it on purpose, but the constant references to semen (especially on one occasion, the presence of it on a young man's moustache after he has oral sex with another man) put me off. Also the numerous instances of incest didn't help. But I confess it is entirely a matter of personal taste.So the verdict: a well-written, fast-paced literary novel, but perhaps not everybody's cup of tea."}, {"userName": "Teresa Proen\u00e7a", "userReviewDate": "Jul 13, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6923777-teresa-proen-a", "userReview": "Muito divertido, emocionante, original s\u00e3o alguns adjectivos que me ocorrem para classificar este livro, de que fiquei com pena quando terminou e com muitas saudades das personagens.A narradora \u00e9 uma velhota, com mais de setenta anos, que conta a sua vida e da sua fam\u00edlia - de muitos g\u00e9meos (quatro pares mais um de presente) - que trabalha no mundo do espect\u00e1culo (teatro e dan\u00e7a).

Wise Children is a lovely book in which there is never a dull moment, and I do mean never. It is funny, audacious, bawdy, and often flat-out farcical crazy, and I loved every second of it. Why is that, you might want to ask, and my answer is that above all, it is just teeming with life.The novel begins at 49 Bard Road, Brixton, London, South West Two. It's a special day -- the Chance sisters (\"Chance by name, chance by nature\") are celebrating their seventy-fifth birthday. Notice I used the word \"their\" -- the women are twins: our narrator, Dora, was born just five minutes ahead of her sister Nora. On this day, Dora gives a \"little shiver,\" because she knows that \"something will happen today.\" She doesn't \"give a monkey's\" what it is -- as she says, \"Just as long as something happens to remind us we're still in the land of the living.\" It's also the day of the centenary birthday celebration of their father, the actor Sir Melchior Hazard, \"though not, ahem, by any of his wives.\" The title of this book comes from an old saying that is brought out now and again here: \"It is a wise child that knows its own father,\" and one thing Carter does quite well in Wise Children is to examine the idea of parenthood -- not just on the paternal side, but the maternal as well.As Dora notes at the beginning, some readers may want to know \"Just who is this Melchior Hazard and his clan, his wives, his children, his hangers-on,\" so her role is to \"provide some of the answers:\"\"It is in order to provide some of the answers to those questions that I, Dora Chance, in the course of assembling notes towards my own autobiography, have inadvertently become the chronicler of all the Hazards...\"and with that, we are launched into a saga which, as W.B. Gooderham notes in a Guardian article, \"contains all the juicy Shakespeare tropes of ambition, greed and revenge; fathers and daughters; brothers and sisters; twins, mistaken identity, incest and adultery.\"I would love to just go on and on about this book, but time and all that. The truth is that I'm sure I could read this book another two or three times and find something new I'd missed before -- that's just the sort of book it is. Anyone who hasn't read this novel is in for a treat -- I can promise that this book is one of a kind, and that it is a story not soon forgotten. It's a lovely book, really, and it's sad to think that this was the last book Angela Carter ever wrote.

Credo che lo spirito giusto per affrontare questo romanzo sia quello della pi\u00f9 completa apertura e disponibilit\u00e0 nel lasciarsi trascinare ovunque Angela Carter voglia portarci, mettendo per un po' da parte tutte quelle belle questioni sulla morale, sulla veridicit\u00e0 di una storia, su regole di tempi e spazi, tutto. Un po' come quando ci si ritrova ad una festa un po' squallida ma troppo grande, dove non si conoscono abbastanza persone e non si sa nemmeno bene perch\u00e9 ci si trovi l\u00ec, e allora si potrebbe cercare in ogni modo di tenere insieme i pezzi, di giustificare la propria presenza, cercare di ricordare i nomi e intuire i comportamenti pi\u00f9 adatti da tenere, finendo con l'isolarsi in una bolla di disagio e straniamento. Oppure si pu\u00f2 accettare di mandar gi\u00f9 in un sorso il contenuto del bicchiere che prima o poi ci si trover\u00e0 in mano, quasi fosse una medicina, e ci si pu\u00f2 semplicemente lasciare andare, seguire l'onda, parlare con persone di cui non si conosce il nome, raccogliere storielle e confondere persone, fare figuracce e voltare le spalle, parlare troppo di s\u00e9 e ascoltare racconti che non hanno probabilmente nessun fondo di verit\u00e0, ma chissenefrega, va bene anche cos\u00ec. Ecco, con Angela Carter bisogna lasciarsi andare ed accettare quello che viene senza fare domande, mettendo al massimo da parte qualche suggestione per ripensarci il giorno dopo, con la bocca secca e la testa pulsante. \u201cFiglie sagge\u201d \u00e8 una grande farsa, ha facciate di cartapesta e corone di cartone dorato, superfici luccicanti troppo vecchie per nascondere la tristezza di un teatro di provincia, la polvere e la puzza di sudore, l'alcool a buon mercato, ombretto di tre colori e ciglia finte che non aderiscono nemmeno bene alla pelle di un viso raggrinzito e incastrato in un passato troppo lontano. \u201cFiglie sagge\u201d \u00e8 il racconto di Dora (Floradora) e Nora (Leonora) Chanse, due gemelle figlie illegittime di gemelli, nate dalla parte sbagliata del Tamigi e dello spettacolo. Loro padre, Melchior Hazard, \u00e8 il pi\u00f9 grande attore Shakespeariano dell'epoca, loro sono ballerine di avanspettacolo nemmeno troppo brave, che da sole valgono poco e niente, ma possono far girare la testa se prese in coppia. Saggio \u00e8 il padre che conosce suo figlio, e saggi sono i figli che conoscono i propri genitori. E in questo romanzo \u00e8 tutto un rincorrersi e avvoltolarsi su s\u00e9 stessi di intrighi familiari, scambi di persona, doppi (non a caso i gemelli abbondano nella famiglia di Dora e Flora), e in fondo a tutto questo immane gioco di riflessi ci si chiede se effettivamente ci sia qualcuno di saggio. E forse saggio \u00e8 proprio quel lettore che smette di interrogarsi su quello che si nasconde dietro il velo variopinto e sgargiante della rappresentazione, perch\u00e9 tutto, se visto da troppo vicino o fuori dal suo contesto specifico, perde di forza e importanza, e finisce per apparire squallido e terribilmente finto, proprio come il comico George a Hollywood. Perch\u00e9 se si gratta sotto la superficie, se si ascolta con pi\u00f9 attenzione la voce gracchiante e appesantita dal gin di Dora, se si cerca di collegare tutti i puntini, inevitabilmente il castello di carte croller\u00e0. Per apprezzare \"Figlie sagge\" bisogna accettare le regole del gioco, sospendere l'incredulit\u00e0 all'interno di un gioco di sospensione dell'incredulit\u00e0, accettare di prendere il racconto di Flora e Dora per quello che \u00e8: un racconto rimaneggiato da tutta la vita, un racconto soppesato e ingrandito, esaltato, confuso e forse anche un po' tradito, lo spettacolo migliore che le sorelle Chanse siano riuscite a mettere in scena. Angela Carter ci regala un meraviglioso omaggio al mondo del teatro, alla finzione, agli scambi di identit\u00e0, alle scene madri recitate con troppa enfasi e agli effetti speciali cos\u00ec palesi da far quasi tenerezza. E ci regala un omaggio a Shakespeare commovente. Shakespeare si respira ovunque, fra queste pagine, ma non lo si respira con la deferenza accademica con cui spesso si trattano i grandi nomi della letteratura: Shakespeare in questo romanzo \u00e8 un vecchio amico, un amico che si conosce cos\u00ec bene e da cos\u00ec tanto tempo che lo si pu\u00f2 anche prendere un po' in giro, gli si pu\u00f2 fare il verso. Angela Carter si sporca le mani con Shakespeare, e spinge il lettore a fare altrettanto. Qui c'\u00e8 tutta l'attenzione ai dettagli, la commistione di farsa e tragedia, il gusto per il grottesco e l'esasperato di Will. S\u00ec, perch\u00e9 credo proprio che Angela Carter possa permettersi tutti i nomignoli che desidera, ed \u00e8 bellissimo che, grazie a lei, anche noi lettori possiamo calarci un po' in quell'atmosfera di grande familiarit\u00e0 che mi piace immaginare dovesse aver regnato sulle assi del Globe Theatre.Un romanzo onirico, dalle tinte esasperate ed esasperanti, un romanzo a tratti non semplice: come in ogni racconto fatto da una persona che ha molti hanni alle spalle, e questi anni li ha raccontati tante volte proprio per il gusto del racconto, i personaggi spesso si confondono, il filo della storia si perde in aneddoti e filoni secondari, il fine ultimo della narrazione si sgretola, lasciando solo il ritmo concitato di una voce che narra e narra e continuerebbe a narrare. E noi lettori, col trucco ormai sfatto e i piedi doloranti, vorremmo solo non allontanarci mai da quella festa dove gli ospiti pi\u00f9 eccentrici ci stanno incantando."}, {"userName": "Ashley", "userReviewDate": "Oct 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32654906-ashley", "userReview": "I probably spent the longest time reading this book compared to all the other books I read due to the complexity and complicatedness of its plot and the unsettlingly eccentric cast of characters.

And, eventually, one remembers with a surprise that streak of magical realism hidden up her sleeve. This is a masterful work \u2013 light and frivolous in tone, but is superbly worded and has playfully sharp dialogue.

Lasciate che mi presenti. Mi chiamo Dora Chance. Benvenuti nel lato sbagliato della citt\u00e0. In altre parole: se venite dagli States, pensate a Manhattan, poi a Brooklyn. Mi spiego? Per un parigino \u00e8 probabilmente una questione di rive gauche e di rive droite. Ma a Londra si tratta della barriera nord-sud. Io e Nora, mia sorella, siamo sempre vissute sulla sponda sinistra, quella che i turisti di solito non vedono, la sponda bastarda del Vecchio Padre Tamigi.\" Ecco, a me \u00e8 bastato questo incipit a farmi capire che stavo per cominciare un viaggio straordinario, in compagnia di due protagoniste eccezionali e di una scrittura che difficilmente riuscir\u00f2 a dimenticare. E infatti non mi sbagliavo, perch\u00e8 questa \u00e8 stata una delle letture pi\u00f9 belle e sorprendenti che ho fatto quest'anno. A raccontarci questa storia \u00e8 proprio una delle due protagoniste, Dora Chance, della quale io mi sono innamorata fin dalle primissime righe e che costituisce assieme a sua sorella gemella Nora l'asse portante di tutto il romanzo. Se in alcuni romanzi il rivolgersi del narratore direttamente ai lettori pu\u00f2 apparire bizzarro o addirittura fuori luogo, qui invece questo espediente ha funzionato alla perfezione, conferendo alla vicenda un'immediatezza e una freschezza che hanno reso il tutto ancora pi\u00f9 coinvolgente. Conosciamo le gemelle Chance nel giorno del loro settantacinquesimo compleanno quando ricevono, a sopresa, l'invito ad unirsi ai festeggiamenti per il centesimo compleanno del signor Melchior Hazard, il pi\u00f9 grande attore shakespeariano del suo tempo, nonch\u00e8 loro padre, che mai ha voluto riconoscerle come sue figlie. Questo invito inaspettato dar\u00e0 il via a tutto il romanzo e permetter\u00e0 a Dora di raccontarci la storia della sua famiglia, una storia che ha innumerevoli sfumature, una storia triste, a tratti assurda, divertente, bizzarra, malinconica, narrata con una profonda ironia, mai forzata, mai fuori luogo, ma delicata, affascinante, irresistibile e che rende lo stile della Carter assolutamente unico. Dora e Nora sono gemelle, sono ex ballerine ormai avviatesi sul viale del tramonto, sono due donne forti che si sono aggrappate alla vita con le unghie e con i denti, che hanno superato insieme innumerevoli difficolt\u00e0, che hanno fatto del teatro e dello spettacolo la ragione della loro esistenza, ma sono soprattutto due figlie illegittime. Questo tema accompagner\u00e0 praticamente ogni pagina del romanzo ed \u00e8 presente fin dall'incipit: Dora parla di una Londra divisa in due, parla della sponda \"bastarda\" del fiume Tamigi, in una potente metafora che accomuna questa visione a quello che \u00e8 anche la loro grande, strampalata famiglia: da una parte il ramo \"legittimo\" degli Hazard, incarnato dai figli che Melchior ha avuto dalle sue tre mogli, dall'altro il ramo \"illegittimo\", che comprende il loro volto, il volto di due bambine avute dal grande attore dopo un'unica notte di passione passata con una povera cameriera di una scalcinata locanda situata nella parte \"sbagliata\" di Londra, appunto nella parte \"bastarda\" della citt\u00e0, una giovane donna morta dandole alla luce. Dora e Nora avranno come unica figura materna la vecchia Nonna Chance, un personaggio incredibile, una donna forte, accanita animalista, promotrice del nudismo e vegetariana convinta, che le accoglie ancora in fasce dando loro il suo cognome e, cosa pi\u00f9 importante, tutto l'amore possibile. Nonna Chance \u00e8 un personaggio frizzante, esuberante, tenero nella sua eccentricit\u00e0 e che riempie le pagine del romanzo a lei dedicate e il rapporto tra lei e le bambine ci viene descritto benissimo da Dora, in maniera schietta, mai melensa, eppure dolce con quella vena di malinconia che si avverte in maniera particolarmente acuta nelle parti delicate e commoventi dedicate al ricordo che di lei hanno Dora e Nora. Questi ricordi sono cos\u00ec vividi nella mente e nel cuore delle due donne, che le portano a sentire ancora il suo inconfondibile profumo di cavoli e naftalina, la sua presenza in quella vecchia casa che avevano condiviso per decenni e che porter\u00e0 sempre la sua impronta. Oltre al rapporto con Nonna Chance, emerge fortissimo nel romanzo il rapporto tra le gemelle e il loro vecchio padre, o meglio, il loro \"non-rapporto\" e tutte le implicazioni che questo mancato riconoscimento paterno ha portato nella vita di Dora e Nora. Sono proprio queste, secondo me, le pagine pi\u00f9 struggenti di tutta la storia e allo stesso tempo le pi\u00f9 reali. L'attesa spasmodica di vedere per la prima volta quel padre che avevano sempre e solo immaginato \u00e8 l'attesa di ogni bambino che aspetta solo di incontrare gli occhi di chi gli ha dato la vita, l'emozione incontenibile che porta Dora e Nora a tremare come foglie, a sentire il cuore scoppiare nel petto, a non riuscire a dire nemmeno una parola durante il primissimo incontro con Melchior \u00e8 quella di ogni figlio che sente di stare realizzando uno dei suoi pi\u00f9 grandi sogni e soprattutto la loro sofferenza, le loro lacrime davanti alla gelida indifferenza di quel padre che tanto avevano agognato di conoscere \u00e8 quella di ogni figlio che si sente inspiegabilmente e crudelmente rifiutato da chi invece dovrebbe amarlo in maniera appassionata e incondizionata. L'unica figura paterna che Dora e Nora hanno conosciuto nel corso della loro vita \u00e8 il loro zio Perry, fratello di Melchior, che si era assunto agli occhi del mondo la paternit\u00e0 delle due bambine per risparmiare al pi\u00f9 famoso fratello uno scandalo in pubblica piazza. Perry \u00e8, al pari di tutti i personaggi del romanzo, una persona bizzarra, amante della vita e dei piaceri che essa pu\u00f2 riservare, inaffidabile sotto una molteplicit\u00e0 di aspetti, incostante, volubile, divertente, animato da uno spirito di eterno fanciullo che lo fa apparire piuttosto irresponsabile agli occhi dei pi\u00f9, ma allo stesso tempo dotato di quella enorme dose di bont\u00e0, di gentilezza e amore che lo porta a prendersi cura delle sue sfortunate nipoti fin dalla loro nascita e ad amarle come solo un padre saprebbe fare. Nonostante la presenza, seppur incostante, dello zio Perry, \u00e8 Melchior che Dora e Nora vogliono conoscere, \u00e8 lui che tentano in ogni modo di conquistare, \u00e8 al suo affetto che anelano, \u00e8 il suo amore che quasi elemosinano ad ogni costo, sognando il giorno in cui il loro vero padre dir\u00e0 davanti al mondo che quelle due ballerine scalcinate, tenere, assurde, divertenti, sono proprio figlie sue, dando loro finalmente il benvenuto nel ramo legittimo della grande dinastia degli Hazard. Nonostante gli innumerevoli rifiuti, la terribile indifferenza che Melchior non manca mai di dimostrare loro, Dora e Nora lo amano di un amore tanto inspiegabile quanto profondo, straziante e doloroso e questo passo che ho deciso di riportare ne \u00e8 la perfetta dimostrazione: \"Quel sorriso! E, accidenti, ci innamorammo di lui, un'altra volta, proprio come avevamo fatto in quel giorno di festa di agosto tantissimi anni prima, quando ci spezz\u00f2 il cuore per la prima volta, quando era giovane e sciocco e impaurito. Adesso vedevamo che non era pi\u00f9 nessuna di tutte queste cose. Eravamo cotte, dalla testa ai piedi. Non avevamo bisogno di parlare. Le parole non sarebbero servite a nulla. Il suo sorriso. Nora stava piangendo come una fontana e lui allung\u00f2 la sua vecchia mano venosa e cosparsa di lentiggini per toccarl, tremulo ed esitante, la guancia con un gesto da spezzare il cuore.\"Dora e Nora dovranno aspettare settantacinque lunghissimi anni per avere da lui quella piccola, semplice, splendida carezza che finalmente permetter\u00e0 loro di chiamarlo \"Pap\u00e0\" come tante volte avevano solo sperato, settantacinque anni perch\u00e8 lui le guardi con un piccolo barlume di affetto e tenerezza, eppure non si sono stancate di aspettare. Nonostante il comportamento indifendibile, sciocco, duro, imperdonabile del loro sciagurato genitore, nonostante le volte in cui ha spezzato il loro cuore, le due donne non solo lo perdonano, ma gli offrono tutta la loro gioia, la loro emozione agguantando ogni suo sorriso per imprimerlo nella loro mente, cibandosi di ogni suo sguardo rivolto a loro due sole, afferrando con disperata felicit\u00e0 ogni suo gesto di affetto, aggrappandosi finalmente a quella realt\u00e0 che per settantacinque anni era stata solo un inafferrabile e malinconico sogno. Non c'\u00e8 solo ironia, divertimento, spensieratezza in questa storia, c'\u00e8 anche tantissima malinconia, dolore, rimpianto, nostalgia ed \u00e8 come la Carter sceglie di narrare tutto questo spettro di emozioni e sentimenti che mi ha lasciato a bocca aperta. Il suo stile \u00e8 sempre molto diretto, senza troppi fronzoli, a volte perfino crudo e amaro, fatto di frasi brevissime ed incalzanti, tanto per le pagine pi\u00f9 spensierate, quanto per quelle pi\u00f9 cupe e dolorose ed io l'ho apprezzato tantissimo. Mi \u00e8 piaciuta molto anche l'ambientazione della storia, questa Londra fumosa, quasi triste, grigia, ferita dalle atrocit\u00e0 della seconda guerra mondiale, dalla miseria, dalla fame da essa portate, resa splendidamente dalla scrittrice perch\u00e8 raccontata in maniera quasi abbozzata, accennata, senza perdersi in infiniti dettagli e descrizioni minuziose, eppure incredibilmente incisiva. Secondo me sta proprio qui la grandezza di questa autrice, nel saper colpire al cuore i lettori anche narrando vicende complicatissime senza approfondirle in maniera eccessiva, nel saper incidere con la sua scrittura in qualsiasi cosa decida di raccontare e nel saperci riuscire alla perfezione anche in pochissime righe. Ho trovato interessante anche la netta contrapposizione tra il grigiore londinese e la bellezza di tutto l'aspetto teatrale della vicenda perch\u00e8 il teatro, in modo particolare quello shakespeariano, gioca un ruolo fondamentale nel romanzo. Il teatro \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che ha plasmato la grandezza della dinastia degli Hazard, \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che costituisce la vera identit\u00e0 di questa famiglia, il teatro \u00e8 l'ossessione di Melchior, \u00e8 il destino di Dora e Nora che gi\u00e0 da piccolissime amavano sgambettare in tut\u00f9 e calzamaglia nei teatri pi\u00f9 sconosciuti e decadenti della citt\u00e0 e bearsi di ogni applauso a loro rivolto, \u00e8 ci\u00f2 che le lega al ramo legittimo della loro famiglia che, pur avendole sempre respinte, ha trasmesso anche a loro il DNA artistico di tutti gli Hazard. Emergono forti i riferimenti a Shakespeare e alle sue pi\u00f9 grandi opere e questo rende il romanzo ancora pi\u00f9 accattivante. All'inizio la storia potrebbe risultare un po' confusionaria, soprattutto perch\u00e8 narrata in un continuo alternarsi tra il presente e le vicende passate, \u00e8 un lunghissimo viaggio che da Londra porta Dora e Nora in America per la preparazione di un'improbabile spettacolo teatrale in cui \u00e8 coinvolta praticamente tutta la famiglia Hazard, \u00e8 una serie infinita di colpi di scena, di amori proibiti, di amori soffocati e tragici, di matrimoni mancati, di scambi di persone, di segreti indicibili, di disastri e fallimenti che in alcuni punti pu\u00f2 travolgere il lettore come un fiume in piena, ma in cui io ho amato immensamente perdermi. Non potrete mai pi\u00f9 dimenticarvi di Dora e Nora, non smetterete mai di amarle anche dopo aver terminato il romanzo, starete l\u00ec a sognare con loro, a vivere tutte le loro incredibili disavventure, a fare il tifo per loro, a desiderare che abbiano la migliore delle vite possibili, soffrirete e riderete con loro, vi prenderanno per mano per condurvi in un viaggio che vi sembrer\u00e0 di vivere da vicino, di toccare con mano, in una storia tanto bizzarra quanto irresistibile, la loro storia, unica e meravigliosa che solo Angela Carter poteva narrarci con tale maestria."}, {"userName": "L", "userReviewDate": "Jul 06, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4328155-l", "userReview": "Oh, icky, icky, icky.

It's the twins' 75th birthday and Dora takes this opportunity to recount the dramatic story of their lives, born on the wrong side of the tracks in South London and into a life of musical theatre as chorus girls (aka \"hoofers\") which is but a faint copy of their natural father's \"legitimate\" acting career. However, fear ye not, that won't deter the Chance sisters from treading the boards, living life to the full and ending up having a less complicated and perhaps more enriching life than the legitimate children of Melchior.Wise Children has copious amounts of twins and this twin theme mirrors the themes of illegitimacy versus legitimacy (not just in terms of birth), upper class and lower class, illusion and reality. However this is most certainly not a dull social treatise but an absolute powerhouse, rollercoaster ride of a tale with Dora very firmly at the helm. I cannot begin to tell you how much I loved Dora, an old gel who likes to give the impression that she doesn't give a damn yet she takes in the invalid ex wife of Melchior who has been abandoned by her upper class twin daughters. Being upper class is obviously not contingent upon being charitable and or/loyal.At the outset I must admit to being rather befuddled by the huge array of characters in this tragi-comedy, but a quick glance at the Dramatis Personae will keep you right and let you sink into the story. I would hope that this list of characters now appears at the front of the novel rather than at the back where I found it, rather frustratingly, when I had read the last page! \"Design faults\" aside, Dora's story has echoes of Shakespeare, Dante, Boccacio, Greek drama alongside the more low-brow allusions to music hall performers with their lewd jokes. Actually there is probably not that much difference between the high and the low at all - just that the likes of Dora and co tell it as it is rather than couching their words in obtuse, metaphorical language. There is so much exhuberance and engagement with life in Wise Children and given that it was written after Angela Carter was diagnosed with cancer, I can't help wondering if this is her song to life, her legacy for her young child, as the closing lines state \"What a joy it is to dance and sing!\". And what a joy it is to have read this madcap, life affirming novel - if I am blessed to live into my 70s, I certainly want to adopt some of Dora's philosphy rather than slipping into grumpy old woman mode!"}, {"userName": "Brenda", "userReviewDate": "Jan 29, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/149902-brenda", "userReview": "Angela Carter's name came off the magical realism list, however this book does not seem to fall into that genre. As it was not what I expected, the pleasant surprise I felt for the story was a nice bonus.The book chronicles the life of un-parented twin sister starlettes from London in the 40's and 50's as reminisced from the present day. The girls' mother died in childbirth and their father, a famous Shakespearean actor turned cabaret and eventually media star, never acknowledges his children as such. But the girls are drawn in and around his life due to their career in show business.Carter paints a picture of two sad, washed up old cranks sitting around living in the past (\"At six we switch to gin.\") and does a nice job capturing the name brands of designer things like perfume and clothing that are particularly obscure. Or at least I think she does, she could be full of it for all I know and making up crazy car makes and models from WWII. One can imagine these over-painted women sitting around a smoky bar name dropping acquaintances to anyone who will listen, but the people being mentioned are either dead or ancient, but they used to step out on the town and turn heads. One can also imagine someone from our generation falling into this trap - sitting around an oxygen bar in 2055 as an octegenarian clutching an out-of-fashion Coach multi-colored patch purse and talking about how she used to party with all the hotties like Nicole Richie and Bai Ling.Poop on this story for the ending. Lame lamer lamest. I wouldn't want to spoil the last bit so I won't go into detail, but I will say that the main plot line fails to wrap up in a satisfactory way and a sub-plot line turns downright creepy.Still worth the read - if nothing else as a cautionary tale to avoid peaking before your time."}, {"userName": "Rosemary", "userReviewDate": "Jan 13, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4723954-rosemary", "userReview": "Dora Chance and her twin sister Nora are the unacknowledged illegitimate daughters of a great Shakespearean actor. Singing and dancing their way through life on the stage and off, they live in a showbiz world full of exuberance and duality where nothing is what it seems - especially family. In this book it really is \u201ca wise child that knows its own father\u201d.I thought of Angela Carter as a difficult writer but this is a very easy book to read. The story carries you along as if you are watching the acts of a circus \u2013 which in a sense you are. All of the main characters are performers in one way or another.

I fell in love with sassy, vulgar\u2014and with just a touch of class\u2014Dora and her engaging narrative, although slightly confusing at times, is the kind I had always wanted to hear from the mouths of actual elderly ladies (there's no way that they've never done/witnessed something scandalous, after all!).Anyway, because I'm very late to this party and all that I've thought to say has already been said, I'll leave a link to this review by Ian \"Marvin\" Graye, which I find apt and utterly brilliant."}, {"userName": "Angie", "userReviewDate": "Dec 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2128058-angie", "userReview": "\u2018Hope for the best, expect the worst\u2019.This is the motto of Grandma Chance, the cheery Cockney who has brought up her two grand-daughters, Nora and our narrator Dora Chance (known professionally as the Lucky Chances, former stars of music hall, stage and as we learn at one time, on the silver screen).Her words crop up throughout Dora\u2019s story and prove wise advice to her two much loved girls. As the story unfolds the \u2018girls\u2019 are now 75 and are about to attend the 100th birthday party of their father, Sir Melchior Hazard, the finest Shakespearean actor of his day, and one who has never admitted openly to his parentage of the girls, so there is much unfinished business afoot.Dora is an imaginative writer and she shares fully with us their outrageously bawdy family history (Melchior was the son of another lauded English stage actor whose origins we learn more about, a little like turning the pages of a Victorian photo album) and the fantastic voyage through life which she has taken with her beloved twin. Twins run in the family \u2013 Melchior\u2019s brother Peregrine is another larger-than-life mentor to the girls throughout their lives and for me, was one of the most vivid characters in this novel. The girls work hard from an early age on the stages of theatres in London and the south of England. Their big break comes when they go to Hollywood as part of the cast for their father\u2019s film version of \u2018A Midsummer Night\u2019s Dream\u2019 in the 1930s\u2019. This, as in many other parts, made for colourful reading:''the wood near Athens covered an entire stage and was so thickly art-directed it came up all black in the rushes, couldn\u2019t see a thing, so they sprayed it in parts with silver paint\u2026The concept of this wood was scaled to the size of fairy folk, so all was twice as large as life. Larger. Daisies big as your head and white as spooks, foxgloves as tall as the tower of Pisa that chimed like bells if shook. Gnarled, fissured tree-trunks; sprays of enormous leaves \u2013 oak, ash, thorn, like parasols, or glider planes, or awnings. Bindweed in streamers and conkers, deposited at intervals in heaps on the ground. Yes conkers. All spikes. And rolling around at random underfoot, or stuck on buds, or hanging in mid-air as if they\u2019d just rolled off a wild rose or out of a cowslip, imitation dewdrops, that is, big faux pearls, suspended on threads. And clockwork birds, as well \u2013 thrushes, finches, sparrows, larks \u2013 that lifted up their wings and lowered their heads and sang out soprano, mezzo, contralto, joining in the fairy songs.What I missed most was illusion. That wood near Athens was too, too solid for me. Peregrine, who specialised in magic tricks, loved it just because it was so concrete. \u2018You always pull a live rabbit out of a hat,\u2019 he said. But there wasn\u2019t the merest whiff about of the kind of magic that comes when the theatre darkens, the bottom of the curtain glows, the punters settle down, you take a deep breath\u2026.none of the person-to-person magic we put together with spit and glue and willpower. This wood, this entire dream, in fact, was custom made and hand-built, it left nothing to the imagination.You spotted snakes with double tongue,Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen \u2013And there they were, waiting in cages, snakes and hedgehogs, not to mention newts, worms, spiders, black beetles and snails, with snake handlers and hedgehog handlers ad lib at hand to keep them happy, waiting for their cue to scatter this way and that across the set as soon as the fairy chorus started up.It was all too literal for me.It took me donkey\u2019s till I saw the point but saw the point I did, eventually, though not until the other day, when we were watching 'The Dream' again in Notting Hill, that time, a couple of batty old tarts with their eyes glued on their own ghosts. Then I understood the thing I\u2019d never grasped back in those days, when I was young, before I lived in history. When I was young, I\u2019d wanted to be ephemeral, I\u2019d wanted the moment, to live in just the glorious moment, the rush of blood, the applause. Pluck the day. Eat the peach. Tomorrow never comes. But, oh yes, tomorrow does come all right, and when it does it lasts a bloody long time, I can tell you. But if you\u2019ve put your past on celluloid, it keeps. You\u2019ve stored it away, like jam, for winter. That kid came up and asked for our autographs. It made our day. ''This is just one example of the rich prose and first person eccentricities which are prevalent in this wonderful story. I loved being party to the life story of these two sisters and the build up towards the amazing birthday party at the end of the book proves that their life is far from over, in fact there are new challenges ahead, which of course, ducky, is exactly how you would like to leave the Lucky Chances.Carter\u2019s gift was one from which any reader (and certainly any would-be writer) can gain an awful lot. Her words and turn of phrase are rich, humourous, gloriously shocking, flamboyant and insanely human. This was her last book before her untimely death. Carter revelled in the diverse, so I have read and this comes across tenfold. So far, everything I have read by her has knocked my socks off \u2013 this story is no exception."}, {"userName": "Ciara", "userReviewDate": "Oct 10, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1333177-ciara", "userReview": "i think this book is brilliant! it's no secret that i love angela carter, as a general rule. she's such a great writer. she has this incredibly rich, verbose style, but it strikes the perfect note every time. it doesn't sound over-worked or clunky. this is the story of two twins born to a poor woman in a boardinghouse. they are the illegitmate children of england's greatest shakespearean actor, a wealthy man who is married & has children from that marriage, who live in the lap of luxury. these girls, however, are brought up by the boardinghouse matron, who sends them to dance classes & encourages them in a life on the stage. the girls go on vaudeville & work their way up. although their father doesn't publicly acknowledge that they're his kids, they are invited to some family functions & their uncle dotes on them & is always bringing them presents from his various world travels. ah, i'm not explaining this well. the upshot is that the whole book is a take off of some actual shakespeare play. the fact that i can't remember which one indicates that angela carter is a bit smarter than me. i mean, it's done well, it's very sophisticated--not at all gimmicky. the whole book takes place via flashbacks while the twins are getting ready to celebrate their father's hundredth birthday--they themselves are 75. there are a lot of twins, a lot of illegitimate births, a lot of people with the same birthdays, a lot of conspircous redheads, a lot of dish about english theatre. i think it's a very feminist book, in the way it addresses aging, beauty standards, sexuality in older women, etc, but when i made a bunch of anarcha-feminist-leaning 20-year-olds read it for a book club, it seemed like they didn't agree. they were very hung up on the fact that the characters wear make-up. they're STAGE ACTRESSES. of course they wear make-up. get off your high horse. man, 20-year-old anarcha-feminists are in for a rude awakening when they turn 70 or so. in sum, read this book & don't be an ideological stick in the mud."}, {"userName": "Chris", "userReviewDate": "Oct 18, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1605591-chris", "userReview": "The first book I ever read by Angela Carter was The Bloody Chamber, which I read because Ellen Datlow &Terri Windling listed it as one of the most read fairy tale based books. (As an aside, I discovered a great many writers and books much sooner than I would've thanks to D&W. Thanks ladies, from the bottom of my heart). While I love Chamber in particular the title story, I now think that my favorite Carter work is this book.What really makes this book is the narrator Dora Chance. A crusty, at times foul mouthed, old dame, she is one of those characters who could quite easily step off the page. (And why this book hasn't been made into a movie, I don't know. Dame Judi Dench could be the twins in their later in life years). It truly does feel that Dora is right next to you, in one of those smoky English pubs that no longer really exists because of the smoking ban, have a gin with you, telling you the whole sordid, messy, humorous story.Dora and her twin sister, Nora, are the illegitimate daughter of an acting scion. They are never, truly acknowledged by their father, but by their uncle Perry and, strangely, their father's wife, 'Wheelchair' aka Lady A. What Dora unfolds for the reader is the family story, worthy of any soapy soap opera. She does so in a unapolgetic, unrepenent tone. This was the way it was, if you don't like it; hoof it style of speaking.It has wonderful lines like, \"Saskia . . . unique amongst mammals, a cold-blooded cow\" or \"Comedy is tragedy that happens to other people\". And I now do wonder about Mrs. Lear.There is much of Ellen Terry and her crowd in the characters, much of the bardioloatry that took hold of the world. Carter mocks all of this, gently. A wonderful funny book."}, {"userName": "Lindz", "userReviewDate": "Jun 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2485778-lindz", "userReview": "Wise Children is so brilliant it made me giddy. I could easily go all fan girl, the writing, oh divine, the Shakespeare references, the theatrics - Carter knew how to build a scene till it reaches a divine surreal hysteria, the characters a 75 year old woman who still wears high heals and a low cut light leopard print top has my respect. But what this book reminded me of is a elderly woman who I use to take, I think it was Classical Lit with in uni. She had to be in her 70's a typical kiwi granny. Then on a Classics night out, she started talking. First of all she could't see why her children should inherit all her money, so she went back to uni, then telling these amazing stories of when she was young traveling around the Mediterranean with a Homosexual, which is what they called them in those days, instead of Fred, or James or Sebastian like today, you know their name. Stowing away on ferries drinking absinthe with sailors, constantly falling in and out of love with men called Spiros or Miguel. She managed to drink us all under the table one night, but to be fair she had had more practise. I wish I could remember her name, but she had lived a life frivolous and important. From little I can remember of that night I remember being completely entranced. Like I was with this book.

This book is irreverent, humorous, tongue in cheek, witty, sarcastic, definitely NOT politically correct, & can be a bit confusing. It has more plot twists & turns than two snakes tied in a knot.

The family intrigues will leave you a little sad, but not for long, as the whole concept of family in this book ends up being not who is there biologically, but who is there for you in all other ways.
