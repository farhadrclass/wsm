I enjoyed seeing 3 of the main characters from the first and how they had turned out after their ordeal. The details of the setting were fantastic. I would say more, but I would have to do it using spoilers and I don't want to do that."}, {"userName": "Bernie Morris", "userReviewDate": "Feb 09, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6847271-bernie-morris", "userReview": "Another work of intriguing fiction from GB Hope. The zombies may not be real but they serve to bring out the best of human nature in those challenged by them, whereas humans, as usual, are their own worst enemies. http://gbhope9.blogspot.co.uk/The three main characters to survive the fake zombie apocalypse in the extraordinary Fighting Out Of Mobberley, England, are enticed to do it all again, this time in an Old West fort in Texas. They and twelve other varied characters are to spend six months besieged by robotic zombies. Transported to the location on a Wild West train, kitted out in cowboy and cowgirl outfits, armed with original Colt pistols and Winchester rifles, they must get along as best they can as winter sets in.From Spike Pitt: \"Just finished Fighting out of New Milford USA...Why would anyone want to go and do another six months of Death and mental torture? Well three peeps would and money can change most people's minds: cowboys, weapons, American attitudes, more nasty automatons and more intrigue. I did enjoy this as well.\""}, {"userName": "Nancy", "userReviewDate": "Feb 26, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8505059-nancy", "userReview": "\"Fighting Out of New Milford, USA\" by G. B. Hope This was a great second story with three of the main characters from the first book included. I loved the first book \"Fighting Out Of Mobberley, England\". I loved that I got to see what happened to these characters from the first book. I loved the wild west setting and the author did a great job with the story of how they could possibly end up in a situation similar to the one in the first book. It was believable to why they agreed to it again , which was a concern of mine I couldn't imagine why they would go again.  In the end I still hope to read more of these characters. I would love to read more of where they go from here. I hope this book gets into the hands of more than zombie reader fans. There is robotic zombies included but the story is so much more and you become so involved in each character and want to know more. Thank you G.B.

The characters are once again well thought out and the drama is pretty entertaining. But, again, motivation is my question. why do they do the things they do? and what is the connection between everyone. and what the FUCK is up with that ending???? maybe there is a third book coming that explains everything... god i hope so."}, {"userName": "Andrew", "userReviewDate": "Mar 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/15247858-andrew", "userReview": "I Received this book in a Goodreads First-Reads give away.Full review to follow."}], "description": "Sequel to Fighting Out of Mobberley, EnglandThe three main characters to survive the fake zombie apocalypse in the extraordinary Fighting Out Of Mobberley, England, are enticed to do it all again, this time in an Old West fort in Texas.
