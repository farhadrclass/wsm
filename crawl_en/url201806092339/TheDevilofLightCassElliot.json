It had me hooked so much that my usual lack of sleep became even less! It is a long book, but that only gives it credence into the detail and magnificent writing.I don't want to give spoilers but will say that I would recommended it as a fabulous crime novel of the highest calibre - and yes, I'm already reading book 2 in the series.

A beautiful detective with a troubled history; bodies turning up in strange circumstances; a villain who himself is only the tip of the iceberg. If that sounds like cliche, think again. The Devil of Light is full of surprises.It all starts when they turn up a half\u2013buried body out in the woods. The strangest thing about this body is that it\u2019s missing a foot. Mystery lovers will enjoy putting the pieces of this puzzle together. There\u2019s a mysterious fire at a local greenhouse. Then a local rancher is impaled on a hay dolly, a sort of giant pitchfork mounted on the front of a tractor. That\u2019s the end of him. What\u2019s interesting here is why the sheriff refuses to arrest the rancher\u2019s wife, who freely confesses to driving the hay dolly.A large number of colorful Texas characters populate this mystery, from the hard-bitten detective, Mitch, to the pudgy Baptist minister, David Cronus. Wallace and Wilbur Pettigrew are twin ranch hands who play a role in the story. The star of the show is Cass Elliot, whose personality is complex, strong and lovable. This is a woman for whom work and career come first, but the choices are never easy.The author masterfully identifies the main characters with their quirks, like the old man and his sweet smelling pipe, and the way a person listening on the phone hearsthe pipe stem clacking against his teeth. Or the crime scene investigator who sniffs the air and declares that there has been no accelerant used for the fire, but maybe cooking oil. Wow, I like the way the author doesn\u2019t skimp on details like this.The dialogue is equally masterful, establishing these characters in their roles, and fixing them in the reader\u2019s mind. The story takes place in a small town in East Texas, near the Sabine River. Racing up and down the back roads in this county, picking our way down the rutted trail through the forest down to the river bottom near Deuces Flat, I just felt as if I was there, smelling the mud and the smoke and the blood. Bottom line: The Devil of Light is an extremely well crafted mystery, a complex web of treachery and betrayal building to a killer finale. I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good mystery, or just good writing."}, {"userName": "Toby Neal", "userReviewDate": "Jan 17, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4463825-toby-neal", "userReview": "***Caution***schedule time to read!I'm a very busy woman. I work 55 hours a week and write when I'm not working, so the LAST thing I need is a suspense thriller so believable, so twisty, so vivid it has me up til 12 PM night after night (granted I don't start reading until ten p.m., perhaps that's where I went wrong!) Hitch and his drill--evil incarnate, yet somehow not as scary as the ordinary men of the very local-color Texas cult that practices corruption of the word of God-- and of every decent thing. These are the monsters that roam among us unchecked, the wolves in sheep's clothing. Hitch was just... a wolf.The only thing I wanted a little more of, was the nice hint of chemistry between the well-rounded Detective Cass and green eyed ME, Kado. Cass is a wounded woman with an axe to grind, and grind it she does--exceedingly well, and to a conclusion that leaves the reader (poor me) wanting more: more of Texas, and more of all things Forney County!"}, {"userName": "Russell Blake", "userReviewDate": "Oct 25, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6177534-russell-blake", "userReview": "Woods keeps the reader guessing right to the last page while crafting a plot with more twists and turns than a silly straw, all in an incredibly thoughtful and well-written novel. Her sense of place is evocative, her characters richly drawn, her command of language dexterous, and her ability to balance all the elements in the story without resorting to cliche or predictable devices unexpected. This debut effort is further proof that there are undiscovered novelists out there who can more than keep up with the big names. I expect we'll be hearing more of Gae-Lynn Woods in the future.

Who says everything has to be done the traditional way in order to work? Gae-Lynn Woods throws away enough of the rule book to keep readers on their toes while sticking to the tried and true when it counts.A mix of thriller and good old fashioned detective mystery, with a very subtle undercurrent of horror, The Devil of Light is well paced with strong characters and an intriguing plot. Following Cass Elliot as she investigates a series of murders and discovers things about her hometown and its inhabitants that leave her with more questions than answers.Having grown up, without her mother and the youngest child and only girl in a large family, her eldest brother in jail for a crime Cass has her own secret behind her choice to join the police force. Driven to resolve her own problems, protect those she loves, and bring justice to her town, Cass is an intriguing, well rounded heroine with enough weaknesses to be realistic and enough spunk to make you smile. I can\u2019t wait to see who will play her when Hollywood gets hold of this story \u2013 and trust me they will get hold of it.The ending, while frustrating, is satisfying \u2013 and leaves me convinced Ms Woods has a series planned. I certainly hope so \u2013 because I really want to find out what happens to Cass and the rest of Arcadia \u2013 and tie up some loose ends.Really, the only question that is important is when do we get to visit Forney County again?by Angelique Jurd (for The Kindle Book Review)"}, {"userName": "Liz Barnsley", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16471876-liz-barnsley", "userReview": "The first thing I need to say about this book is, I was very impressed with how well written it was, and how quickly the author draws you into the world of the protaganist, Cass Elliott, without giving anything much away about what is coming for her. The \"family\" scene at the start of the novel really gives you a sense of her before you begin to dig into the main plot. I love this - sometimes you feel that a main character in a novel is embroiled in all sorts of things but you don't actually know anything about them until later. It wasnt a long drawn out scene, but it was enough. As to the main plot, when a man is found murdered, his wife unconcious nearby, and strange photographs peppering the kitchen, Cass and her partner Mitch (another well drawn character) find themselves in the midst of a violent cult that has remained hidden for years. I won't say anymore...the story expands and contracts in almost perfect harmony - you have your twists and turns, yes in places it is very violent but not vicariously so, and oh, the ultimate resolution - believe me its heartstopping. This is quite a hard review to write in that there is a lot more I'd LIKE to say, but the chances of me giving accidental \"spoilers\" is too high so I will shut up now. If you like mystery novels I would just get a copy and find out for yourself. I seriously doubt that you will regret it."}, {"userName": "Lynette Aspey", "userReviewDate": "Mar 05, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6493437-lynette-aspey", "userReview": "Apart from one little hint that there is another layer to be revealed, this novel is your standard detective-thriller/murder-mystery. A series of apparently unrelated events: a mutilated skeleton, arson, the murder of a prominent businessman by his abused wife and revelations that respected members of their community are involved in a morally twisted, pseudo-Christian cult, begin to reveal themselves in interesting ways as Detective Cass Elliot and her colleagues unpick the evidence.The pacing is unhurried; there\u2019s plenty of time to get to know the characters and their relationships. The author has gone to a great deal of trouble to set up her cast, crew and backdrop. The heroine has enough spice and sufficient history to make her interesting, while the supporting characters are well drawn and carry the story along.Unfortunately for Detective Cass Elliot (but interestingly for us) the end result of her actions bring her to the attention of the cult leader\u2019s secret instrument of evil; a predator down to his DNA, who now has her in his sights.

I had a little bit of trouble getting into it and almost gave up on it at first but once I started learning who was who and getting more and more hints about what was going on, I had a hard time leaving it to do other things I needed to do.When I got toward the end and saw that there wasn't enough pages to answer all the questions, I figured there would be a sequel. I can't wait to read the sequel and I think this author has a very bright future ahead of her.This is a novel about a small town in Texas and a lot of dirty secrets shared by a large part of the more powerful people in the town. It is one of my favorite kinds of books where the heroine doesn't know who she can trust. I love the relationship she has with her dad and brothers and with her partner. She has been damaged emotionally and that shows up in the way she handles her job.

They are so lively and real that you can feel yourself inside the novel, like you were living the story with the characters, standing on their side. It's something which is not so common, so all my kudos go to Gae-Lynn, well done.The final cliffhanger has kept me literally glued on the story, so I can't wait to read the #2 book."}, {"userName": "Scott Bury", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5301204-scott-bury", "userReview": "I began reading Gae-Lynn Woods\u2019 The Devil of Light in January, at about the same time I started watching True Detective on HBO, the gritty series starring Woodie Harrelson and Matthew MacConaughey, and was immediately struck by the similarities between the two stories.Both stories feature victims of ritual murders, corpses found in bizarre poses and clues pointing to occult behaviours. Both stories also hint at a circle of sexual abusers of children, men who use their powerful positions in their communities to cover up their crime and enforce the secrecy of their cults.And a further connection between the two: True Detective is set in the Louisiana coastal plain, just across the state border from east Texas, where you could find Arcadia, the setting of The Devil of Light.This novel bears an uncanny resemblance to Project Truth, a police investigation in Cornwall, Ontario of a suspected ring of child abusers, men, including priests, who traded their child victims among themselves.I was so struck by all the similarities that I even emailed Gae-Lynn Woods, author of The Devil of Light, to tell her about it. She responded that she had not watched True Detective, nor heard of Project Truth, but she was going to look into both.But this post is a review of the novel by the independent author from east Texas, so let\u2019s concentrate on that.The story: A complex series of murdersThe Devil of Light begins with a drifter, who adopts only the name Hitch, ritualistically killing an unnamed victim at the behest of an \u201cold man.\u201d Cassandra \u201cCass\u201d Elliot and her partner, Mitch Stone, are assigned the investigation, which is hampered because the body has no identification. They suspect it\u2019s a missing migrant worker, but before they can make much progress, a local businessman and hobby farmer, Lenny Scarborough, is murdered by his long-abused wife in a spectacular, if very rural way \u2014 she drives the spikes of a hay loader through his chest.In Scarborough\u2019s house, the detectives discover the motive of the murder: photographs of men having sex with young girls and with other men. All the shots are very close-up and show no faces; scars in one picture, though, match the murder victim\u2019s body. It seems Angie, Lenny\u2019s long-abused wife, had discovered the photos while Lenny was working in the cow barn, and that was enough to channel the anger from years of physical abuse into driving the specialized fork-lift truck through her husband.The photographs lead the police to suspect their idyllic town harbours a ring of pedophiles, and the investigation indeed uncovers it \u2014 a ring comprising some of the most powerful and respected men in the community.This being a crime novel, the bodies begin to pile up, as do layers of secrets and conspiracy.Where a writer\u2019s skill is criticalWoods is a skilled and talented author. She creates detailed and believable characters, people readers can picture and hear. The main character, Cass Elliot \u2014 who insists that the coincidence of her name with that of the late singer from the Mamas and the Papas is really nothing more than a coincidence \u2014 has an interesting back-story including rape and a scar around her breast, as well as an older brother serving a long jail sentence for something he may not have done. But Woods knows how to keep the back-story from bogging down her plot, and brings out details when they\u2019re needed, just enough to keep us turning pages (or swiping the e-reader screen) to find out more.Very few weaknessesThere are a lot of characters in this book, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to keep them all straight \u2014 especially the younger minor policemen, most of whom seem to be blond and athletic. This is in opposition to most of the baddies, who in addition to sharing a compulsion to sexually abuse young people, share a propensity to obesity.The family and social links among the police, suspects, victims and those who discover the bodies also get thicker and more tangled, enriching rather than confusing the story.The main characters are clearly drawn and consistently presented \u2014 except for the main bad guy. The author never names him, and provides only enough detail to make us suspect he could be one of two people in Arcadia.Overall, an enjoyable and thought-provoking novelWhile this novel has an enthralling climax and satisfying conclusion, it did not solve the mystery or end the story. Again showing her writing skills, Gae-Lynn Woods leaves us on the last page of The Devil of Light with a reason \u2014 no, a need \u2014 to buy the sequel, Avengers of Blood.Well done, Ms. Woods!5*"}, {"userName": "John Davis", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/8609189-john-davis", "userReview": "Clearly Gae-Lynn Woods is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the crime thriller genre. The Devil of Light begins as a classic crime, murder mystery but very soon the reader learns it is so much more.Following the death of upstanding member of the community, Lenny Scarborough, at the hands of his wife, a disturbing trail begins to emerge, a trail that threatens to shake Forney County to its very foundations. Following that trail are the story's protagonists, Cass Elliot, a firey young rape victim determined to prove herself in a man's world, and Mitch Stone, an experienced detective who remembers Cass before her world caved in on itself, as they seek to uncover the truth behind Scarborough's dark past.At its root, the plot is a mystery, but unlike most this is no ordinary case of the good catching the bad. Packed with intrigue, deception, and a century-old conspiracy, The Devil of Light is an epic tale that delves into the unquestionably real scenario of what happens when the professional success of powerful individuals develops into a capability of undermining local authority. In similar vein, Woods powerful writing deals with the horrifying effects of when such men are misguided by the ambiguity of Christianity's most controversial beliefs and warped by the effect of ancient cult, blurring the line between right and wrong.The Devil of Light is excellently written, beautifully paced and offers such great eye for detail that the reader will have no problem following the locations in vivid detail. The main characters are both convincing and likeable and the development of the main protagonist is excellent, allowing for the effects of personal trauma and dealing with the horror of overcoming events that threaten to unleash the demons of her past.Fans of the crime thriller genre will undoubtedly be charmed immediately by the writing of Ms. Woods, but this is not merely confined to the fans of Marple or Wexford. Fans of the thriller genre will love it for its intrigue, fans of horror will relate to its darkness, and, as the author's career develops, I'm sure Cass Elliot and Forney County will earn a special place in the hearts of many of the genre's hardcore fans...Bring on the next one!"}, {"userName": "Dana Griffin", "userReviewDate": "Jul 08, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/9348430-dana-griffin", "userReview": "I enjoyed reading this novel. Ms. Woods wrote a compelling story that engaged me from the beginning and didn\u2019t let up. The characters were interesting and fleshed out throughout the book so that I came to love and cheer them on, or hate them.The plot, set in a small Texas town with some strange murders taking place, was intriguing. Throughout the book I hoped the protagonist, Cass Elliott, and her fellow police officers would discover who was doing the evil deeds they investigated. Ms. Woods used enough detail in setting scenes that I could easily visualize them without long paragraphs of scene building. The other thing I found satisfying was very little backstory. There is just enough for the reader to know there is more to the main characters that drives them, or has given them their point of view, without pages of backstory. You learn most of the characters past through conversation with other characters which makes for a more interesting read.If I had something bad to say about the story, it is the abrupt ending. It comes to a satisfying conclusion, leaving the following novel, Avengers of Blood, to pick up where The Devil of Light left off. But it left many questions that I would\u2019ve liked to have seen answered. This was probably Ms. Wood\u2019s intention as I feel how Cass Elliott answers those questions will be quite involved and will make this reviewer read the sequel soon.I would recommend this novel to anyone looking for a good mystery revolving around cult-like activity."}, {"userName": "Terri Powers", "userReviewDate": "Apr 23, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7288292-terri-powers", "userReview": "The Devil of Light is a fast-paced, suspenseful crime novel set in a small, peaceful town in Texas. The peace is disrupted as mysteries dating back to the 1920\u2019s, and bodies from recent missing person reports, boil up to the surface.Gae-Lynn Woods leaves you hanging at the end of each chapter with a little tease that will keep you moving through to the next chapter. I like the main character, Cass Eliott and her partner Mitch Stone (great detective name). The investigation into the crimes, the procedural work, is detailed enough to be interesting, but not so detailed that you get caught up in the words and get bored. I was never bored in the book and the author did a good job of describing the scenery and the characters to draw you into the story.There were very few grammatical errors, which led to an enjoyable reading experience. The story was interesting, believable, and had me thinking it could happen in any small town where people know practically everyone in town.Ms. Woods is writing her second book based on the same characters in what, I hope, is a sequel to this story. Because that is probably the only thing I didn\u2019t like \u2013 I didn\u2019t want the story to end without finding out who is \u201cthe old man,\u201d and seeing justice for the killings (I\u2019ll admit I\u2019m a little selfish here).

The writing is so effective that even this reader\u2019s overbearing sense of editorship was cast aside and I found myself carried along by the story, the wonderful characters, the riveting sense of place and the real trauma of a community in crisis. Cass Elliot and Mitch Stone make great detective partners. The supporting cast of law-enforcers, law-breakers and members of the close-knit community all come to life in the midst of Woods\u2019 assured prose. There is plenty of evil about in Forney and plenty of good to combat it. Criminal investigation, crisis, violent action and the normal intercourse of ordinary people are all handled with aplomb. There is no sense of stepping back from the often gruesome, sexually disturbing and manipulative nature of the events which have been secretly enacted over generations and now explode into the present.A truly excellent work of fiction.

She's one hell of a storyteller, and if \"The Devil of Light\" is any indication of what to expect from her, we'll hear a lot more about Ms. Woods. \"The Devil of Light\" is a tense, sometimes enigmatic tale of murder, mayhem and deception set in a small east Texas town where it appears some kind of quasi-religious cult is carrying out rituals that are leaving people dead and children sexually assaulted. Forney County sheriff's detective Cass Elliot is on the case, and it's not going to be an easy one, since some of the community's leading citizens are prime suspects. Woods breathes life into a host of colorful characters, from Elliot, the only female detective in the department who has to battle a variety of prejudices and protective instincts of others, to the enigmatic 'Hitch', a mysterious ranch hand who stays in the shadows but seems to enjoy inflicting pain on others, to a variety of fellow officers and townspeople playing critical parts in the tale.

The writing is smooth and comfortable, and I must admit that after reading several crime/mysteries with sudden overwhelming romantic elements in the midst of messy and intense investigations, I was happy with this one that did not succumb to romantic trappings and therefore remained true to the character of Cass Elliot, and her past as brought forth in these pages (I know there is more story to tell there, about her personal life, more to be meted out by Woods over the course of the series).

When she responds to a 911 call at the home of a prominent businessman, she finds him violently murdered. Cass is stunned when she finds graphic photographs scattered across the floor of the kitchen. This introduces her to a shadowy sect called The Church of the True Believer. Cass and her partner delve into a world of blackmail and violence. In the center is a cult that has been concealed for almost a century. Their investigation triggers a brutal response. Powerful men want their identities protected at all costs.The subsequent media frenzy and weak sheriff begin to destroy the trust within the department. As Cass and her colleagues close in on the cult\u2019s members, more chaos is unleashed. Evidence leaves them with more questions than answers. With time running out, Cass and her partner must pull the department together for this final confrontation with evil.Review:The Devil of Light introduces the reader to Cass Elliot, detective of the Arcadia police force. Cass has is a tough small town detective but has demons of her own to deal with. Arcadia is a quintessential small town: everyone knows everyone and has for generations. Ritual human sacrifice is something they have little experience with. Evidence points to important people within the town. With a sheriff unwilling to confront this, Cass and her fellow officers are working at a disadvantage. Gael-Lynn Woods weaves this together, taking elements of cozy mysteries to make a real page turner. The evil is real, but how deep does it go? Does the cult itself even know? It is a complex web that neither side may fully be able to untangle. I look forward to the next Cass Elliot novel."}, {"userName": "RedRedtheycallmeRed", "userReviewDate": "Jun 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16123194-redredtheycallmered", "userReview": "For such a long book, there was no ending. The case wasn't resolved, there's no answer as to whether a major character is alive or dead, and it's unclear if Cass even has a job with the police department. Seriously, all that and I have more questions than when I started?Several of the characters were racist and/or homophobic (even some of the \"good guys\"), yuck. Cass' brothers use the word \"fag\" in casual conversation, WTH?I bought two books in this series at the same time, and part of me wants to read the second one to get some answers, but I don't want to get strung along with no end in sight, either."}, {"userName": "Nola Arganbright", "userReviewDate": "May 17, 2018", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/17508999-nola-arganbright", "userReview": "So GoodA long book but well worth the reading time. Well written with a strong plot and characters. This book could be considered violent and the scenes are descriptive but for me the storyline outweighed the violence because I wanted answers to the mystery."}], "description": "A BIZARRE MURDERWhen young Detective Cass Elliot responds to a 911 call at the home of a prominent businessman, she finds him violently murdered in the barnyard with his battered wife unconscious near the tool that killed him.
