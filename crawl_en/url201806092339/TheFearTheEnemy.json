Drowning, fire, suffocation, abandonment, being eaten alive, having your head used as a centerpiece? Well\u2026all that and more can be found in Charlie Higson\u2019s world. *grins* I love this man!The Fear, fun, and action picks up five days before the end of the previous book, The Dead. Mr. Higson has been playing with the timeline all along, but this story just fit and locked into place with the previous books like a key in a lock. Beautiful, bloody storytelling! With patience, power, detail, and oh-I-see-now revelations-- everything comes together. Brilliant! :) Let\u2019s dive back in to a world where every adult over the age of 16 is out for blood! Kid blood!This story focuses on DogNut, Courtney, and a small group of kids determined to step out from behind the walls of \u201csafety\u201d to explore, hunt, and search for new kids and old friends. Restlessness and the need to know propel the gang across London to hook up with other bands of kids and settlements. \u201dIt\u2019s safe here, but I been feeling more and more boxed in lately. All we do is get from one day to the next. I\u2019m taking control of things. Hitting back. Not letting the sickos rule my life.\u201dDogNut was not one of my favorite voices from the last tale, but he certainly has a unique, memorable, and hilarious style and way of expressing himself. He can make me smile one minute and groan the very next. Haha\u2026You can never predict what will come out of that boy\u2019s mouth. Can DogNut lead, protect, and make the decisions necessary to survive though? He will need all his strength, courage, and every trick in his bag to survive the horrors in the streets of London. Hold on! It is going to be a wild, bloody, gore filled ride! One of my favorite aspects of Higson\u2019s writing is the way he pulls together so many kinds of voices and perspectives. From kids to sickos, readers get to taste all sides. He is constantly changing the view. One minute we are down on the street laughing and poking fun with the kids as they pick their way through the rumble of London. Then *BAM* readers are floors above the same gang looking down\u2014watching as a horde of grownups push, drag, and drool along to surround the kids. From laughing to stomach dropping shock in a blink of an eye! Truly stunning. The suspense, action, running, twitching, decaying, and blood splatter never stop! Your heart will be racing along with the action!My reading heart falls in love with plots, villains, heroes, lovers, and endings almost every day. :D But I can\u2019t remember the last time I wanted to latch on to one scene and profess my undying devotion. There is a chapter here that I want to carve out, hold it up to the heavens and say\u2014See this! This is perfect! The Collector. *bows head in creepy awe* The first time DogNut\u2019s gang falls into The Collector\u2019s den of horrors and STUFF is unforgettable. I sucked in a breath and never let it out until I needed air to swear and shout\u2014\u201cGET OUT OF THERE.\u201d The suspense, fear, filth, and horror will leave you breathless and grossed out. I actually got up and washed my hands after this scene. A powerful chapter in my reading life I will treasure. Do you want to know what The Collector collects? *shivers*Sorry I know I\u2019m gushing all over the place. So let me get one point in at least. Haha\u2026 This story is layer after layer of life, history, loyalty, courage, power, and friendship. My heart kept pulling out one thread over and over though\u2014We can\u2019t do it alone. Whether life is full of zombies or not, life is too hard, cold, and lonely without love, friends, and support to help us along the way. This story is filled with death, but it pulses with life. Pages and moments chock full of heart shattering pain and decisions, but also hope and love. Friends holding on to friends. Never giving up. Searching for more. This supposed upside down world, where psychos rule, grownups literally fall apart, and kids show tremendous strength every single day filled my heart with love, disappointment, pride, pain, and hope. Everything life is about.All that said, you would think the blood, chunks of flesh, brains, and buckets of ooey-gooey fun would be what gave me a true *chill* here. But really one line got through my hardened horror wall of defenses. One line sent cold, cold shivers dancing down my spine and straight to my heart\u2026.\u201dWhat difference will one more day make?\u201dI am dazzled and addicted! Can\u2019t wait for more. I am waiting by the door until the next book comes from across the pond\u2026.waiting, waiting, waiting! Favorite DogNut insult:\u201cskonky ratburger\u201d hehe\u2026Huh? :DFavorite Description:This one actually made me \u201ceewww\u201d. \u201cfoul cocktail of bodily fluids\u201d"}, {"userName": "Jo", "userReviewDate": "Sep 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2467655-jo", "userReview": "I have to admit, I wasn\u2019t looking forward to reading this book. Well, I wasn\u2019t not looking forward to it because it\u2019s Charlie Higson and you know you\u2019re pretty much going to be left speechless after you\u2019ve finished one of his books in this series but, from the synopsis I was a bit \u2018meh\u2019. I mean, there are only so many times you can read about a group of London misfits walking across the city finding other London misfits and fighting the occasional zombie. Do you get what I\u2019m saying?And while the second book offered me a chance to find out more about the gang in the Tower of London, I wasn\u2019t especially sold on an entire book about DogNut. Eh, he was a non-character to me in The Dead. I didn\u2019t dislike him but\u2026. Ehhhh.Oh Mr Higson, you are the King of the YA Castle and all the others are dirty rascals. And I am the fool for doubting that you knew exactly what you were doing.Because by the time I had finished this book, I was hopelessly devoted to DogNut and I would have followed him all across London in a heartbeat.Before I go into full on \"RA RA RA HIGSON *high kick*\" mode, and believe me it\u2019s coming, I might as well get the bits I wasn\u2019t too mithered about out of the way. Because even though I am, um, enthusiastic about these books\u2026 there were some parts that I could\u2019ve done without.Like David. I just don\u2019t get that character at all. And Paul. Actually, that whole\u2026. situation is a bit odd. And Brooke\u2026 well, she\u2019s interesting. I haven\u2019t decided properly just yet about our Brooke.Except when she describes boys as \u201chunks\u201d. I am very decided on that fact and I have come to the conclusion that no girl ever would describe a guy as a \u201chunk\u201d without immediately cackling a moment later. But maybe I\u2019m just being a bit picky because I am Team Courtney.I think the problem with having books like these that have so many characters within them is that you\u2019re bound to get your favourites and I tended to get a bit cranky and impatient when we weren\u2019t spending time with them.Also, and this is just me being stupid so this doesn\u2019t count as a black mark against the book as such but I had somehow managed to convince myself that one of the story threads was the beginning of The Kid's story, but it wasn\u2019t. At all. And this made me sad because I genuinely missed him. He\u2019d better be in The Sacrifice or else\u2026. or else.But soon those minor niggles flittered away because I got to the end and I was flabbergasted. And there aren\u2019t many books I can say that about, which is a shame because I love the word flabbergasted and wish to use it more often.My favourite thing about this book was that it is so obvious that Mr Higson never ever runs out steam. Usually at this point in a series, the author has run out of things to say, lost their grip on their characters and run out of ideas and the plot is so thin it could get lost in your back teeth. But in this book, and let\u2019s remember this is the third in the series, Higson\u2019s story is still racing ahead and I have absolutely no idea how it\u2019s going to end.I adore how these kids\u2019 stories have been set in motion right from the beginning and Mr Higson has handed you all the pieces you need to fit them together and just leaves you to it. This actually makes it worse because when the pieces do come together and you\u2019ve worked it all out, you can\u2019t even blame him for all the feelings because he didn\u2019t hide anything from you.He has obviously thought about every single detail in this series, interweaving the stories and the characters together and ensuring that if he started a character\u2019s story in the first book, he sure as hell finishes it eventually.Yes, ladies and gentlemen, that\u2019s my attempt at being cryptic and mysterious because I simply refuse to spoil the bit that got me so worked up. It made me leap across my room and play bookshelf Jenga to retrieve my copy of The Enemy and The Dead and shout \u201cNO BLOODY WAY!\u201d.Well, ok, I didn\u2019t shout as such but I definitely whispered it in a shocked manner.Seriously, I have no idea what I\u2019m going to do when this series is over. I\u2019m almost tempted to dress as a zombie and lurch around a group of under 15 year olds in a terrorising manner just so I can feel like I\u2019m back in this story.But I won\u2019t.Because that would be odd.And there is a chance I would get scowled at and/or bottled.You can read this review and lots of other exciting things on my blog, Wear the Old Coat."}, {"userName": "\u2728    jamieson   \u2728", "userReviewDate": "Feb 13, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7706640-jamieson", "userReview": "\u201c...the smell that came out of the lorry was disgusting. Sour and rotten. 'Jesus, who's died?\" he said. 'About four-fifth's of the population of the world' said Justin.'Very funny\u201d\nHOLY FREAKIN HELL these books are so much better then I actually remember them being the first time. I cannot believe this !!WHAT IS THE ENEMY? It's The Walking Dead meets the Gone series. In the near future, the entirety of the population over 15 is either dead, or diseased and now \"zombies\" (or sicko's as the kids call them) who are looking to eat all the kids they canAND ITS FREAKIN WILD.Ok it sounds like trash(it kinda is sometimes)BUT ALSO ITS SO GOOD psa ! The third one, THE FEAR, is definitely the best so far!Especially because all the different groups are now meeting and interacting and merging togetherWhen Brooke met up with Maxie and Blue I yelled !!!!!!ANYWAY\nREASONS WHY THE FEAR + THIS WHOLE SERIES IS THE BEST \n\u2192 It's got lots of different storylines, which all merge up together. LIKE BASICALLY all the kids move into different areas of London - you got the Buckingham Palace Crew, London Tower Crew, Natural History Museum Crew, Parliament House Crew .... and then they all meet up, and all their stories combine and it's BEAUTIFUL. It's so beautiful. Also, they all shit talk the other crews which is a good laugh for me, the reader, who knows them all individually and loves them all. \u2192 The timeline. So you'll be following one crew, but while you're following them other crews are making deals and working together. You'll switching perspectives and realise what's going on behind other crews backs. I love how it seems like the world is always active and things are happening no matter which characters you're following at that time \u2192 The zombies. They are. freakin. terrifying. SO SCARY. The zombies are organised !! they make plans !! they ambush kids !! some of them use knives and things !! some of them even talk a bit !! yikes yikes yikes. Also there are different zombie groups and like, sub groups within the zombies so they are actually really interesting !!\u2192 The setting. The books are all set in London, and the fact the kids are living in iconic London places is so cool !! I love it !! \u2192 Fast paced af. Literally so much happens, and not all fights between kids and zombies. There is a lot of politics between the different groups of kids, lots of little fights between them and exterior plots, like discovering cures for the sickness or some religious stuff going on which means it's actually alot more complex then kids fighting zombies \u2192 The different groups of children. Love how they all have different cultures, ideologies, beliefs. Love how each group is v different ! Love how there is lots of politics and drama between the groups and there are even people who don't fit into groups, some kids who are good and want an organised world, some who are anarchists, some who are loners. Some who drift. It's very cool getting to know them all !! I love the diversity \nSOME OF THE LETDOWNS \n\u2192 The characters can be a bit boring and plain. Not all, some of them I love so much !! But some of them are boring and not very deep. The characters do go through character growth, but this is more about the plot and so the characters suffer a little because of it\u2192 Lack of diversity. Anytime there is a character that is a \"minority\" they die. It's so annoying. In all of these kids its a bit urggh most of them are white and straight. Like why god WHY. I'm annoyed the diverse characters are always killed off. It's not good enough imo \u2192 Rep of women can be a bit iffy at times. There are some great female characters (Jackson, Courtney, Nicola) but in general the way that women are talked about and portrayed is a little stereotypical and blergh at times. I don't like it how the women are stereotyped really badly into \"mothers\", \"bitches\", \"weaklings\" u know it's the worst HEY THO ! These books get better and better with each one, and after book3 we are caught up with the events at the end of The Enemy which is exciting !!I'm coming up to the books I've not read yet (I had to reread the series to finish it because I couldn't remember) and I'm excited to see where it goes from here I really recc these books ! They are fun and read really quickly, and are actually alot more complex then they let on. ALSO THE NEW COVERS ARE THE BEST \n\u201cIf we make our own history, if we tell stories that bring us together, we'll be stronger. It'll give us something to believe in. The sickos can't do that \u2013 they're no better than animals \u2013 but we can. Every battle we win we have to tell the story over and over, so that we can win more battles. People love stories. They've told stories since even before they could write. Myths and legends, stories of heroes and villains, gods and monsters. Real things happened, the story got told and then the stories became legends. That's what we've got to do \u2013 tell our own heroic stories.\u201d"}, {"userName": "Mr.G", "userReviewDate": "Sep 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/407405-mr-g", "userReview": "Zombie horror really doesn't get any better than this. I've really enjoyed J.L. Bourne's Day By Day Armageddon series and Z.A. Recht's Morningstrain Trilogy, but Higson's The Enemy/The Dead/The Fear series is really superior in a number of ways.For those unfamiliar with the series, Charlie Higson's books are set in contemporary London where a \"28 Days Later\" style virus has affected every adult, turning them into a ravenous flesh-eating monster. Children and young teens are unaffected and band together in little tribes to survive. The whole thing is kind of a \"Lord of the Flies\" meets Night of the Living Dead.The books benefit from a number of intriguing distinctives. Each has the best elements of survival fiction. The reader is easily drawn in by these kids' creative and at times ingenious attempts to survive in a hostile urban wasteland. Furthermore, the books are very British and the reader is treated to a somewhat exotic (to an American reader) teen culture. Additionally, the element of adults preying upon children is horrific on a scale rarely seen in young adult fiction. Honestly, these books are the most horrifying young adult literature I've ever come across. Finally, Higson uses a really interesting narrative style I've never encountered before. Though he's already written three books in this series, the books are not strictly chronological. They should probably be read in the order of publication, but don't necessarily need to be. Minor characters that wander into the first book's third act have their back story developed in the third book for example. It is difficult to explain how the author accomplishes this, but it definitely makes for gripping reading."}, {"userName": "Darren Hagan", "userReviewDate": "Jul 07, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/34101852-darren-hagan", "userReview": "*No spoilers*These books are destroying my soul and I don't think I can take it haha. The Fear begins a few days before the start of The Enemy, and features primarily characters from The Dead as they journey across London trying to find what happened to their friends that they got separated from a year ago. It does get to a point where it happens simultaneously with The Enemy. I really liked the way that this was done and it brought the groups characters together neatly.I keep finding myself getting so attached to these characters, and when some of them die I actually feel the loss. I need to start realising that no one is safe, so stop getting attached! There was a couple of changes of opinion from the first time I was introduced to them. One was far more deviant and ruthless than I first thought, and another had much more depth. And there is one character that just needs to die so badly!!!!!One thing I do appreciate is that some of the chapters are actually from the view of the infected adults. I feel like it just adds more to the story to see inside the head of the villains. These adults are just getting scarier too - they are actually thinking and plotting and becoming very formidable zombies.There is rarely a dull moment throughout these books and its so tense the majority of the time. I'm really not sure I can take much more from them. They are giving me so many feels!"}, {"userName": "Hamelynn Harzman", "userReviewDate": "Feb 28, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/58891300-hamelynn-harzman", "userReview": "This series reminds me of the Star Wars Saga. All of the books connect in the most terrifying yet beautiful way. I think that, with the right people, this would be a great TV series.The infected ones, the adults, are always thought to be the enemy. However, kids can be just as dangerous. Kids are just kids. They don't know any better and inexperience and impulsive decision-making isn't a good combination. And being naive and not infected, they are, in a sense, far more dangerous than any zombie.For characters themselves, I can't say my favorite's name since I revealed she died in one of my updates, but she was awesome. She was so relatable and she pretended to be strong when on the inside she was in shambles. I also liked Shadowman. He always knew what he was doing whether he was fighting, spying, or talking. He always had a plan and was prepared for anything and everything.Overall, this was an amazing book.

I liked this book because it tied some characters from the other books together, and gave me different perspectives on some of the other events, but I still feel like it could've been easier to understand.

Here are a few reasons why.The kids.They are so varied; some a devious, others honourable, but they are all absolutely terrified by 'the sickos' that plague their existence. David is a particularly ruthless and calculating character, busy plotting to take over London in the new world in the relative safety of Buckingham Palace. Shadowman is a great addition - a real hero to root for and feel nervous about whenever he's attacked. To bring someone so immediately likeable into the series three books in is a great achievement.The action.Charlie Higson writes brilliant action scenes and can create some terrifying scenarios of kids stuck in cluttered and dirty houses with hoards of zombies (or one particularly disturbing 'collector'). He's also not afraid to 'go there' with the gore. This particular description was perhaps the highlight: \u201cThere was a tearing noise and half the mother\u2019s face came away. Shadowman was left with a handful of skin and pus.\u201dDisgusting, but brilliant, right?!The premise.It would be very easy for Higson to let the situation take a back seat and to stay away from tough questions about whether the kids should sympathise with the undead, whether they should try to rebuild their society, whether they should try and find a cure for the disease. The fact that he addresses them through the kids themselves adds a sense of reality and perspective, reminding the reader of just what a shitty situation the kids are actually in.I highly recommend this and the previous books in the series to anyone who has enjoyed anything remotely zombie related. One word of warning though, it isn't suitable for younger readers. (I know a lot of books say that these days, but really. Seriously.) The reasons outlined above make this book and series far more than a blood-filled, unrealistic zombie-fest. It feels very real and could absolutely terrify many 'teen' readers out there.Absolutely, bloody, brilliant though.

I finished reading The Fear last night and I am still not completely over what had happened! I totally started to bawl my eyes out once I was less than 100 pages towards the end. HOLY GUACAMOLE! Talk about an ending!Seriously, each book in this series keeps getting better and better than the last. Just like the previous two books, The Fear was full on action-packed, gruesome, heart-wrenching and just plain insane. I grew emotionally attached to the characters in The Fear. Especially to Dognut, Courtney and Shadowman; They were my favorite. I loved how well they all worked together with their groups (except for poor shadowman, he had the worst luck with his.) Charlie did an absolute phenomenal job at bringing all these individual characters to life. I felt their fears, worries, excitement and everything else in between; like if I were right there with them. The only characters that I absolutely loathed were David, Jester and Paul. They are deranged! Someone, please, get rid of them! It's also extremely nerve wracking to see just how evolved the \"strangers\" [zombies] are becoming! Anyway, The Fear, so far, is my favorite of the series. I can't wait to read The Sacrifice next month!

A lot of events towards the end of this book actually occurred in the first book, so I was really confused at times. There were some pretty boring parts of the book, but the suspenseful parts made up for it by a long shot. Charlie Higson proved, once again, that he can kill anyone in this series. Two of my favorite characters died together towards the end of the book, and I was slightly heartbroken over that. I thought it was really cool that there were more chapters centered in the minds of those infected as they slowly became more intelligent again.

While zombies and dead kids is bad enough there is also lots of other things going on that give you chills the way some kids have turned into power hungry cold beings while other seem to really be working for a better future. The series is set in London and as I live close to there you can\u2019t help but feel cold shivers when going by a building that\u2019s been used in the book. The Author has brilliantly written the book in a way were everything feels so real and downright creepy and scary at times. There was long moments in the book were I held my breath fearing for the characters and willing them to KEEP GOING! It was easy to get hooked into this world that the author has written. The book showed you lots of things you never got to see in the first or second book and if you have read all the books like I have you will see that each book is like a piece of puzzle and they all fit together in a wonderful and perfected way. I felt that while the book is action packed with more blood and guts then a slaughter house there was so much more going on. David is one character while power hunger and evil to me he also kind of makes the book cool because you\u2019re willing other character to over thrown him. There are lots of other characters that you start to love but you\u2019re always scared that they will not last with all the zombies about.

Higson is proof that just because an author's book get tagged as a \"young adult\" title doesn't mean the work is second tier.

No scene is wasted, no plot point is a throw away, it all fits together, brilliantly in the end, and believe me you will absolute joy, as well as a healthy bit or terror, when you see some scene from an earlier book shown in a different book from a different \"camera angle.\" Higson is brutal and unrelenting to his characters, as befits the giant sandbox of post-apocalyptic London he has cast them down into. I have only three questions: 1. When is the next book in the Enemy series going to get to the States?2. Why am I not already reading the next book in the enemy series? (and preferably the one after that and so forth.)3. Why are all books not written by Charlie Higson?

Although it couldn't help but feel like a prologue. It fills in all the gaps created by the last two books in the series. In fact, the feeling i have after reading it, closely resembles that after watching \"Deathly Hallow's Part 1\". And that feeling is, WHERE IS THE REST!?In case you didn't know, in a nutshell, this book is the third in a series (with more to come) where all adults over the age of 14 (is it 14? i think it was) have either died, or become brainless, kiddy-eating zombies.In this third book, Dognut, a side character from the second book (NO SPELLCHECK, i DO mean Dognut, Stop trying to correct it to DONUT, jeez), travels across the zombie-plagued London to reunite with some of the friends they were split up from, and the girl he 'Likes'.However the zombies are becoming less brainless as these novel's progress, and are becoming much more of a formidable opponent. And again, the question is raised: Who is the real enemy? For kids are taking up settlement, and surviving in different ways. David however, the leader of the group who have found refuge at Buckingham palace, is power hungry to take over all that is left.The main character of this novel, was really 'Dognut'. And he was brilliant. I didn't like him in the last book, and if i met him in really life, i probably would have thought he was a wander, but he was my favourite character in this book!As with the rest of the books in this series, one of the best parts of reading them, is the fact that you really don't know who the author will kill off. Or the zombies, rather.You know that none is safe, which really adds to the suspense. However in this book, i found there were slightly less death's throughout the middle and beginning, which all lead up to a big blood bath at the end, which was ultimately quite shocking. Some great characters that i were sticking out for, ended up sadly dying, which ended up being quite tragic. However the 'Hollaway' kids were briefly introduced in this book (The set of kids from the first novel) Which only means they will be in the next book, 'The Sacrifice\". And i've been waiting for them to reappear since the start. Maxie and Blue FTW!One other thing i love about this series, is that it features great landmarks in London as set pieces, and what makes it even cooler, is that half of these places i have actually BEEN to. The imperial war museum for one, i went there on a school trip in year 9. For some reason i find this extremely cool and amusing. Well, at least it made it easier to picture!A great series, that is extremely unpredictable, and features brilliant characters! But the prize question. Is it scary? Not from my point of view, i'm used to horror movies and books (COUGH-STEVENKING-COUGH) however some parts i think would be disturbing to others, and i even found some bits quite disgusting and gross.Make sure you check this series out!That is all ;)"}, {"userName": "Kahleia Corpuz", "userReviewDate": "Mar 31, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/47405498-kahleia-corpuz", "userReview": "Dystopians never seems to fail me on its massive death count.

After loving the last two books I was really disappointed with this one. My main issue was the romance, love triangle, and the fact I didn't like DogNut, Brooke or Courtney at all.

There were some characters from book 1 that we had, but not many. It involved a lot more mental problems than physical. It is mainly, just like the second book, to tie up loose ends and to give a backstory for new ones. The end is very abrupt. It seemed to be thrown in to set up the plot for the next book( and book 1). It is good that the author is showing more light on the infected, through Shadowman's story. It also shows us that not all the kids want to kill all \"grownups\" or \"sickos\". It seemed important that no one had the technology to do so, so the author had to add a new location, the museum, where the logical place for equipment like that would be. Certain part, like the end, was very abrupt, but overall a good book"}, {"userName": "Erin", "userReviewDate": "Feb 19, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3947264-erin", "userReview": "[Okay, this space is basically just where I cry about DogNut dying. I was reading so late that I couldn't really have a true emotional response, but I felt just... empty. I'm used to Higson killing his kids, but DogNut seemed so safe! I mean, he's the protagonist! You don't kill your protagonist! How it went down: 1. I find out Courtney is dead. 2. I literally believe it is a joke or a dream sequence. 3. DogNut gets stabbed. 4. I start to realize Courtney is actually dead, but there's no way Dog can die as well. 5. Frickin' narrative switch to a different set of characters. 6. Come back to Brooke! 7. Why is Brooke narrating? 8. I don't even like her. 9. Where's DogNut? 10. HE'S DEAD??!!? 11. And it just kills me that his whole journey was about redeeming himself for letting Leo die, then for letting Olivia die. He hated himself for always leaving his friends behind to protect himself, even though it was necessary in order to stay alive. And finally he has his moment, his big moment, when he orders his group to stay and protect their friends. He redeems himself. Maybe it's poetic or something that he dies in the process.

Reading the books back to back, it's so obvious how many threads are running through the story and how they're all starting to pull together. Yes, it's gory and horrific and heartbreaking. But it's also fun and tense and constantly intriguing, even when it's stabbing you in the feels by killing your favourite characters. 22/5/20153.5 stars. I don't know what it was about this book, but I didn't enjoy it QUITE as much as the previous books. I feel like it was partly because it felt gorier - there's a huge fat zombie guy who keeps children as toys and rips off their limbs so they can't escape and then creates tableaus with their body parts, for starters - and partly because the story was split between multiple locations and it was a little tricky to keep track of it all sometimes. This is the book where the events of books 1 and 2 start to blend together, so I'm REALLY interested to see what happens in book 4, especially seeing as the zombies are becoming meaner and smarter and are forming armies and using weapons. So...that's interesting. As always, don't get attached to ANYONE in this book. If you do, Higson will laugh maniacally while jumping up and down on your heart. The deaths are usually pretty quick - this is YA after all - and the story ploughs on leaving the reader little time to mourn for the characters. Which is kind of sad because the characters are generally great (except for David and Paul), and yet it's hard to have feels when these amazing characters get killed off because it all happens so quickly. In short, I enjoyed it - although not QUITE as much as the previous books - and I'm excited to see where things go from here."}, {"userName": "Mehsi", "userReviewDate": "Mar 20, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6720768-mehsi", "userReview": "4.5 stars.As these books progress, they get more gory and also more disturbing.There were just times I had to stop reading, stop going on, and sometimes I just had to skip. And at other times I wanted to know more. There are new disgusting characters in here. We got the collector, my God, he was scary and disturbing. Taking and maiming kids, and doing God knows what to them. We also have St George (who I knew from the next book), who is a very scary, smart and organized zombie. We also got various other zombies, like the gym bunny mother. It was kind of scary to see things from her point of view.And then we have the children. My God, Charlie Higson doesn't go out of the way to kill them does he now? It happens in all the books, that main characters or even side characters gets killed off as easily. It doesn't happen often that writers do this, so it is kind of awesome that Charlie Higson does so, sadly I am also not so happy with it. I keep hoping that these kids would survive, but well... nope.David is just a scary kid. The power really went to his head and made him all psycho.I really liked Dognut, Brooke, Courtney and all the other characters we meet in this book.Well I will be waiting for book 5 now. Hopefully it won't be long before I can read it. I am kind of curious as to why the zombies are being able to think, are able to use weapons. And I am also cheering and hoping some kids will at least survive this damned thing.Review first posted on: http://twirlingbookprincess.com"}, {"userName": "Ms. Yingling", "userReviewDate": "Sep 03, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2636606-ms-yingling", "userReview": "Sequel to The Enemy and The Dead. The zombie plague is still affecting the adults over the age of 16, and some of them manage to stay alive by eating children in graphically described disgusting ways. DogNut's group is pretty safe and secure inside the Tower of London, but some of the children want to venture out to see if they can find friends and relatives they lost. After taking a boat down the Thames, the group runs into other groups of children, as well as plenty of sickos. DogNut doesn't really want to stay at Buckingham Palace with David, who is a little too fond of the power he has now, nor does he want to stay with Brooke at the Natural History Museum. Traipsing around town leads to the gruesome death of several of the children, and the book ends with more sickos being unleashed.Strengths: Best zombie books ever. Blood, gore, you name it. PLUS, kids get to be in charge of great London landmarks like the Houses of Parliament.Weaknesses: I had trouble keeping all of the characters straight, and didn't really care because I figured they would all be dead soon. Also, the kids spoke in fractured English that I don't remember from the other books. There was also a long riff by one of the girls about how fat she was. Really? You're living in the Tower of London and trying to save everyone from flesh eating zombies, and you're worried about whether the boys will like you because your butt is too big? I think I zoned out after that. Somewhat disappointed-- I really liked the other books. At least one more to come."}], "description": "The sickness struck everyone sixteen and over.
