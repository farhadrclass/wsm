That's what I call books like Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe. The premise of this book like most Monroe fanfic is that The Kennedy's murdered Marilyn Monroe to hide the fact they were having affairs with her. Now while I agree that based on available evidence Jack & Bobby Kennedy were with all probability having affairs with her. I think its pretty ridiculous to think they either had her killed or as this book says Bobby Kennedy killed her himself. From everything I've read or watched about Jack & Bobby Kennedy they were most definitely slutty whores and I often wonder when they found the time to conduct the nations business. I don't think they killed Marilyn Monroe to keep her from talking. Even the author admits that Marilyn had a reputation for lying and her struggle with mental illness was well known, so had she held a press conference as it is alleged in this book she planned to do. Its doubtful anyone would have believed her. Also we have to remember that in the 1960's the media didn't report on the lives of politicians. I once read that Ben Bradley the former editor of The Washington Post & friend of JFK said that the press could have walked in on JFK having sex with intern and no one would have reported it. I love Marilyn Monroe. I love her movies, I love her songs(I'm Through With Love is my fave) and I love reading about her life. I don't think she committed suicide. I think she was addicted to opiates likes millions of other Americans and she simply took too many pills. That doesn't make it any less tragic or interesting. Marilyn Monroe probably had Bi-Polar Disorder and like lots of people self medicated with drugs.

Tell all about a star without her there to defend herself. Marilyn has always been, to me, one of the most misunderstood \"stars\" of the universe. Perhaps it was her destiny to carry the mental illness that crippled her mother. We will never really know. Modern medicine was not as modern back then and Marilyn seemed destined to live a life of depression and desperation, that was constantly medicated.She always said she just wanted to be loved, but perhaps she never really knew what that word meant. When I read this I had the feeling that she felt alienated from everything and everyone around her, trying desperately, to find some sort of common thread, no matter how tattered, thin, or tenuious it might have been.Her choices were compulsive, anyone who showed her attention or compassion in at small way was something she latched onto like a drowning woman in the middle of the ocean. I doubt that anyone really had her best interests at heart, they all wanted a piece of Marilyn Monroe, and in the end, she broke, into a million pieces."}, {"userName": "Richard", "userReviewDate": "Dec 03, 2010", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/438580-richard", "userReview": "What a mess!

A lot of ink has been spilled over her life and even more over her death, and while I'm sure there are inaccuracies and omissions in Anthony Summers' \"Goddess\" ...was a fantastic read. Summers traces her life from birth til death, but not in a simple, linear fashion. He acknowledges (if not embraces) the complex mythology that has built up around Marilyn Monroe. He uses Marilyn's own words about her life (which changed frequently over time) as well as those of the friends, relatives, and colleagues who knew he best . Ultimately, the picture he paints is a sad one. The story of a little girl who never quite grew up; the brilliant actress with crushing stage fright; and the sex goddess who really just wanted to be loved. I was amazed at how much she was at the crux of mid-century life and fame and that she knew...absolutely everyone. Most haunting, certainly, were the last days of her life...her decent into drugs and alcohol and loneliness. All in all, a compelling read and a well-rounded portrait."}, {"userName": "Wordsmith", "userReviewDate": "Nov 30, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7584724-wordsmith", "userReview": "[image error]"}, {"userName": "Tonya Wertman", "userReviewDate": "Jan 15, 2008", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/786030-tonya-wertman", "userReview": "This was the first biography that I ever read....I was a Freshman in high school and this book and Marilyn Monroe's story have stayed with me ever since. It is the most in-depth and personal account of this truly unique woman. It's an absolute page turner and you are sure to discover many things that will shock you. By the end of the book I was emotionally attached to Marilyn and she will forever be a goddess to me. Why such a tragic ending for an immaculate screen goddess? The real tragedy is that she never realized the consequences of her actions. Her lifestyle- non-stop drugs & sexual promiscuity- destroyed any ounce of hope & future that was awaiting her. This book teaches many lessons and unfortunately, the most beautiful woman in the world lost her life in the process. Then there's the question of her death being a murder.

America's favorite poor little rich girl.She was used, she was abused, and she was not amused.Problem is, she also used, abused and didn't amuse those closest to her.Was her death an accidental overdose? Was it an intentional suicide? Who really knows. The fact remains that she did have very marked suicidal tendencies and had attempted it in the past. Luckily for her, her past attempts were always twarted by her friends... I guess, in the end, it just became a case of the little girl who cried wolf once too often.Did she have affairs with all the men depicted in the book? Probably, probably even more that aren't in the book... she was used by, and she used men (and abused, and excused, and wathever othe used term you wish to add).I loved in the book how she was so concerned for animals and children and even flowers, yet she was constantly receiving flowers and wearing furs wherever she would be.What it comes down to is that she got everything she ever wanted and more. When she discovered that some men were \"non-available\", she palyed out her usual scenario probably thinking that the dejected man or men would come to her rescue. This last time, they didn't get to her in time.Sure there were probably cover-ups, but aren't there always ways to try and place the blame on others?This book is pretty dated, it was published in 1984, over 20 years after her death. Marylin's been dead for over 50 years, she still haunts our memories to this day. Isn't it surprising that celebrities that died young in the 60s and 70s still have so much star attraction in the 21st Century?Addendum: This book was given to me by my mother, which is the only reason I even read it.

His writing tone is very readable and not at all humdrum. The title of the book suggests there are many layers to his research, and this is proven chapter after chapter. Goodness knows how long Summers spent on his research, for it is candidly thorough from start to finish. As a fairly long book, it would have been easy for him to waver and focus on more interesting, dramatic parts of Monroes life e.g. her various gynaecological issues, marriage breakups etc. This biography falls into the 'I love Marilyn' section, which is absolutely fine, as most readers will already be ardent fans of hers.She comes across in a favourable light, again, which is reasonable for most readers!Highly recommended, and a welcome addition to any bookcase."}, {"userName": "Laurie", "userReviewDate": "Mar 07, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/18031439-laurie", "userReview": "This is the worst famous Monroe biography.

It speed untrue stories which add to the supposed \"mystery\" around Monroe. It even has an autopsy photo, which Monroe fans don't want to see as we want to focus on her life, not her death.

It covers her career from her early days being a photographic model through her death in 1962. It is comprehensive in its scope, in the acknowledgements the author claims to have interviewed about 650 people, there are almost as many footnotes covering the 50 chapters plus a 50 page postscript of additional information discovered after the book was written in 1985 (the postscript was added in 2007). The author interviewed people who knew Ms. Monroe and friends and spouses of those people and refers to several dozen published works on Ms. Monroe. The research is very impressive.Her career is best described as a \"meteoric\". She was in the Hollywood star system and got a contract at a movie studio as $50 week. In the final years of her career she was earning $100,000 per week. Summers spares nothing in describing how she had made that climb. She took advantage of those around her as well as being taken advantage of by the same system. . Her personal life is best described as a \"mess\". She never knew her father and her mother was sent to a mental hospital when she was thirteen months old. She had a need for constant companionship which resulted in numerous sexual encounters and affairs. The author claims she had as many as thirteen abortions, the first in her late teens. Her one unfulfilled dream was to have children and a family but physical damage caused by those abortions prevented her from completing a pregnancy as an adult. She, like many in the Hollywood community at the time, became alcohol and drug users. Her drug of choice were mostly barbiturates, although an interview with Timothy Leary strongly suggests she tried LSD. In the later years before her death, she was seeing a psychiatrist daily. She called her friends at all hours of the night, then took sleeping pills to get to sleep. This resulted in problems with her getting to movie sets on time to work because of the drug's effects. It wasn't unusual for her to be several hours late for filming. As she got older her reliance on drugs increased and she became more of problem to work with. She was fired from her last movie due to her inability to get to work timely.The most interesting section of the book describes her relationship with Jack and Bobby Kennedy. The book follows the relationship with both brothers, documented by eyewitnesses and verified by secret tape recordings made by the FBI, organized crime and Joe DiMaggio. The CIA also had an interest in Marilyn's activities. Her contacts with the Kennedys, organized crime and people in Mexico the CIA considered possible threats to US security made her a target to them also.Summers goes into great detail into the circumstances surrounding her death. He proposes an alternative story to the official police report evidenced by eyewitness reports of certain individuals not included in the police findings. Summers points out the deficiencies in the investigation and autopsy which halted any follow up investigations when questions about her death were raised by people outside the LAPD. I found this to be one of the most interesting section of the book.Finally, the postscript was written in 1985 as a result of a television segment to be shown on the ABC show 20/20. Following up on the details and questions raised in the book, ABC investigators and the author did additional research, including a FOIA request to see the file on Monroe held by the FBI and CIA, which presumably contained information on the surveillance tapes and the extent of stakeout activities on Marilyn and her acquaintances. So much of the papers in the file were redacted, they turned out to be unusable. After months of work by ABC, the planned segment was cancelled by Roone Arledge, then president of ABC News division. Arledge was then close friends with the widow of Bobby Kennedy.A substantial part of the book is built on oral testimony and recollection by people who at times have an interest in hiding or disclosing information. Summers is clear on this point. But the weight of the research is undeniable. . When a conclusion is suggested by second or third party information Summers isn't afraid of suggesting alternatives or even that he could be wrong. For me, that adds to its credibility. As I said at the beginning, if you have any interest in Ms. Monroe or even the Kennedys or the circumstances of her death, this book is a must."}, {"userName": "xoSammiDxo", "userReviewDate": "Aug 08, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/32825993-xosammidxo", "userReview": "I would prefer rate the book 2.5 stars, its not quite deserving of the 3 star rating. I only opted for the higher 3 star rating rather then the 2 star due to the amount of research/effort the author put forth. But in the end, the research was in vain because the book remains 89% hearsay.Not being someone who had a great admiration for Marilyn prior to reading this book, I must give credit where credit is due. The author exposed enough of Marilyn's personality that allowed me to fall deeply for her. Anthony Summers is no doubt a good writer. Although, he doesn't have many nice things to say about Marilyn until the end of the book, and only 3 paragraphs worth. The rest is passive aggressive comments about her sexuality, addictions, and emotions. Yet I was able to sift through things and find a true Marilyn emerge. I attribute that to Mr. Summers writing abilities. It's as if Mr. Summers is writing in riddles; forced to claim one thing, but to the observant reader, exposing the other.My reasons for reading the book were simply to dive into the many conspiracy theories surrounding Marilyn's death. I was not disappointed, this book definitely engaged in conspiracy theory after theory after theory. The book provided a wonderful timeline of Marilyn's life and enough references for me to sort through fact and fiction via my own research. I can say with tremendous confidence, the authors conclusions surrounding Marilyn's death are ridiculous.How anyone with a thread of morale conscious can make allegations without even 1 shred of evidence or proof is beyond me. Marilyn's death happened more than 50 years ago, there is no evidence supporting the authors claims. Zero, zilch, nada. Even though the hearsay claims diaries, tape recordings, and video recordings all exist to support such claims, nothing has ever surfaced. It is unbelievable that with all of the hands supposedly involved (gov., mafia, friends, housekeepers, etc.) there is nothing we can grasp onto. Well, actually there is.Who earned millions through Marilyn Monroes estate? Who had 24/7, unlimited access to her home, staff, body, mind and soul? Who was prescribing her the very medication she overdosed from? Come on!! There is evidence pointing to a very specific set of people. People all linked to each other, people who sheltered Marilyn from those she called friends and family. People making thousands of dollars from Marilyn in life and millions of dollars in her death. People who were manipulative and at the very least, have some serious malpractice issues to defend. Where is this book?? This is the book I want to read.I am perplexed as to why so many cling onto the Hollywood gossip rather then the facts that are right in front of them. Marilyn deserves justice, past actions by those closest to her at her time of death need to be brought to light. This book does not even entertain these notions. This book is only more Hollywood gossip.
