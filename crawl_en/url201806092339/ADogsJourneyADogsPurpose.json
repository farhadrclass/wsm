This dog keeps coming back for his favorite human, Ethan, no matter what. He's been Toby, Bailey, Ellie and, at last, Buddy. Once Ethan passes away at an old age, \"Buddy\" thinks his purpose is fulfilled. He loved Ethan with all his heart and now Buddy is ready to pass on. Only...things don't go to plan.\nNow what? Was I to be reborn over and over, forever? Could a dog have more than one purpose? How was that possible?\u201d\n In his last few years as Buddy, he meets Baby Clarity - the granddaughter of Ethan. Buddy saves Clarity - once from drowning and once from an anxious horse - and both times, Clarity was \"under supervision\" of her mother (Gloria)And when Buddy finds himself reborn (yet again) - this time as a poodle mix named Molly - he also finds his way back into Baby Clarity's life. Clarity - now a teenager called CJ - desperately needs love, affection, protection and just about everything only a dog can offer.Gloria is ever the narcissistic, neglectful mother and CJ is coping in all the wrong ways - running off, dating the wrong sorts, and binging and purging. \"Molly\" doesn't know what to do to help CJ. \nIt cannot be a dog's purpose to understand what people want because it is impossible.\n But no matter what, Molly will do his best to love his human. After his lifetime as Molly, he comes back again as Max (a Yorkie-Chihuahua mix) and again as Toby (a beagle mix). Each time, he is reunited with CJ when she needs him most.\nShe taught me that it was a good thing to love more than just my boy, Ethan, opening my eyes to the fact that I\u2019d actually loved many people in my lives, that loving humans was my ultimate purpose.\n This was an ah-mazing sequel. It really is an absolute delight when the sequel turns out to be better than the first. The author did a fantastic job of blending a \"dog-level\" of comprehension along with enough clues to alert the human readers to trouble. This book tugged all the right heartstrings - I desperately wanted this series to continue but I am in absolute love with the way this one ended. \nYou can usually tell that a man is good if he has a dog who loves him.\nAudiobook CommentsNarrated by George K. Wilson. The reader did a pretty good job but his voice sounded too...human. I kept forgetting that Molly/Max/Toby was a dog because the narrator was so good at his diction."}, {"userName": "Mary Lou", "userReviewDate": "Jul 04, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7098587-mary-lou", "userReview": "If you read \"A Dog's Purpose\" you'll feel the same way - good or bad - about this continuation of the story. Have your hankies ready and your dogs close at hand. Some reviewers of these books complain about the simple writing style. The story is supposed to be told by a dog, and part of the message is that dogs are simple creatures. It's part of the books' charms. Readers in search of Great Literature shouldn't expect to find it in books that depict dogs with thought bubbles on the covers, for heaven's sake. Cameron's books are for people who want a unique, engaging dog story. My only gripe with this installment is that our main human character never seems to catch a break. There's always more calamity heading her way, and my stomach was in a knot throughout most of the book. The good news -- as much as I enjoyed these two books, I was pleased that \"Journey\" had a definitive ending. This shouldn't be a trilogy or series -- too much of a good thing can ruin it. Now I'm going to go hug my dogs and tell them how good they are. There might even be a treat in it for them."}, {"userName": "Nik Markevicius", "userReviewDate": "Jul 20, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3400326-nik-markevicius", "userReview": "As a writer myself, I can't help but look at the mechanics of a piece when I read it. Not that I've lost the ability to enjoy a well-told tale. I'm like an auto mechanic at Cruise Night, admiring all the great work. A Dog's Journey is a great story, a great sequel, and one of the best books written about dogs. The first book, A Dog's Purpose is the kind of emotional gut-wrench to a dog owner like me that makes you proud to care for a canine, and proud of the loyalty they show to us. ADJ does more of the same, but with a more unified focus, and it's here, in this sequel, that the narrative power of Cameron shines. Combined with his ability to portray a dog's point of view at a high level of detail and (in my experience with dogs), accuracy. Never did I stop to think, \"Hmm, that doesn't sound like a dog.\" I was drawn in with this approach, and made to care deeply about the dogs, the people, and what happens to them. I can't always say I get this involved in the characters, but when I do, those are the books which are usually most memorable. If you're not a dog lover, or at least a dog liker, steer clear. If you're like me, grab a copy of ADP Aand ADJ, settle in, and oh, yeah: be prepared to laugh, smile, yell at imaginary people, cry, and of course seek out a furry friend many, many times. I'm pretty sure you'll want some hugs and licks and cuddles."}, {"userName": "W.

I am willingly spoiling the plot, the same way I would yell DON'T DRINK THE POISON at somebody. Why read a book where you fall in love with the dog and then, in the end, the dog dies?I wrote A Dog's Purpose as a love poem to the relationship between people and their pets. And, since true love never dies, and no truer love comes from a source more treasured than the heart of a dog, I gave my readers a gift--the dog doesn't die in the end. That's not really a plot spoiler, that's the premise. This means that at the end of A Dog's Purpose, the dog is still alive, leading me to wonder, what next? Could there be another purpose, or an extension of the same purpose?A Dog's Journey picks up where A Dog's Purpose left off. If you loved the adventures of Buddy/Bailey, you'll want to know what happens next, because it turns out that Ethan has a grandchild, and there is no one better to look out for an adventuresome, accident-prone child than a loving dog--especially a dog as wise as Bailey."}, {"userName": "A.D.", "userReviewDate": "Jun 04, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/3067039-a-d", "userReview": "I usually don't read dog books because I can't handle the crying, but a few weeks ago I had to put my beloved 16 year old Shih Tzu to sleep and I was really struggling with my decision and my loss. Some random person I had to call at a call center told me about it and I decided to give it a try. I'm so glad I did! It helped me a lot to realize I made the correct choice and was very healing for me. Especially because I got my dog as a suicidal teen and having her to love and love me back saved my life. So I really connected with the way this dog is taking care of his human because my little Puhka was that for me through my depression and then years of health problems from a horse riding accident that led to 5 years of constant vertigo and then another 5 years of hip problems. She waited until after my hip replacement last year at 32 years old was healed enough that she didn't need to take care of me anymore. Just like this sweet dog.Though I've never cried so hard in a book before, and throughout pretty much the entire thing, I also laughed almost the whole time to look at the world from a dog's perspective and get an idea what they might be thinking and feeling.

It is one of my 5-star books, and I am very, very stingy with giving out 5-stars. Unfortunately, for me at least, A Dog's Journey suffers from \"sequel syndrome\", and just was not as good. This book continues to be told by the dog, in his/her continued reincarnations. This time the dog becomes attached to Ethan's granddaughter, Clarity. But most of this book was about Clarity (CJ), and the conversation and thoughts of the dog just became repetitive. I never really felt attached to Clarity either, and in fact her problems and issues were a bit annoying. The best part of this book for me was the first two pages, and the final two pages. The remaining 327 pages were just filler. Easy to read, but still just a lot of filler.

I read it all in two days. It starts off years after the first book left off. Buddy is an old dog. His master, Ethan, had died and Buddy was convinced his purpose had been fullfilled and he would finally enter eternal rest at the end of his life. He spent the last of his days watchhing after a little toddler, Clarity, who was always getting into mischief around Buddy's farm. As he died, he knew that Clarity would need a dog of her own to look after her, but he never expected that he would be that dog. Yes, buddy ends up being reborn and he finds Clarity again, who is now a troubed teen suffering from an eating disorder. Now named Molly this loving dog devotes herself to Clarity, who now goes by CJ. Molly goes through more lives and in all of them she finds CJ again.

I devoured this 330 page book within a day \u2013 a record for me. I was just unable to put it down. The writing is so well done and I loved the way it was written from a dog's point of view.

And I am not afraid to admit that I bawled my eyes out at the end and then bawled my eyes out again when recounting it to my husband. Some of it felt like a rehash from the list book and some of it seemed pretty predictable but this didn't make my love for the book wane.

The ending is a definite tear jerker and there's a lot of humor in it being told in a dog's POV which makes it better then an usual average book. The only real sad part is that its over, but hopefully W. Bruce Cameron will keep writing books like these. It basically begins were the first one left off and then he dies as Buddy so that he can become 'Molly' in his next life to now take care of CJ. CJ's mother isn't the best and she's a troubled teen who thinks no one understands and she suffers from anorexia. What I liked:-The relationship between owner and dog. I wish my dog was reincarnated but who know maybe she is :)- CJ is like every other teen she wants to fit in and have a caring mother that doesn't blame her for the day she was born. -The fact that CJ's talking huge things with Molly and then dog will be chewing a stick not a care in the world \"'I just need to keep you hidden one more night and then she's gone for a week. Can you go without barking tonight?'I chewed a stick\" (65).Along with that sometimes I even forgot that it was in a dogs POV. What I didn't likeIt's not much and it obviously didn't affect the book considering I have it 5 stars :)-CJ denying her feelings for Trent- Gloria; but without her what would this story be? -The fact that when Molly was reborn into another dog she couldn't talk and tell 'her girl' who she was ): but she did some things like Molly CJ noticed but thought Molly was just communicating with the dog...Overall:An amazing read and a book series that I'd recommend to any dog lover trust me the Journey's worth it!Favorite quote:\"I think I had known it all along, but one day while I was squatting and smelled my urine it occurred to me that we weren't brothers but brother and sister.

This book is so significant and is a great conclusion to the first one, I've enjoyed it, but also I've suffered, so without further ado, let's begin!4.5/5 StarsYou can find this one in SPANISH and more of my review on muy blog A Book. A Thought.\nA Dog's Journey, is much darker than the first book, plays very delicate subjects such as bulimia, suicide and cancer, so of course it's a book with a great emotional content, it was impossible for me not to cry like a thousand times, I feel that after reading this book I'm ready to read anything lol. In this one we continue the journey of Buddy, who now feels that his new purpose in life is to take care of Clarity, the granddaughter of Hanna and Ethan, who has quickly become a problematic teenager, and we'll can see how through his various reincarnations, fate always acts so that they'll meet again\nI really like the Clarity's character, it's very obvious from the beginning that the mother is really the problem here and both, her rebellious attitudes, and her eating problems are largely due to the upbringing that this one has given her in the course of her life, and the lack of affection that she has received from her mother. We witness as Gloria (Clarity's mother), again and again denigrates her daughter to make her feel really miserable, Ive hate this woman, I really did, and the way she treats Buddy is horrible and so inconsiderate, this kind of people never deserve to have an animal as sweet as a dog, is very despicable.The way C.J (Which is like Clarity now calls herself) treats Buddy is very warm and sweet since they meet again, \nI've love this relationship as much as I've loves Buddy's with Ethan, it's so real, loyal and sincere\n, it was very beautiful to read how C.J cares about him and she'll do everything possible so that they can be together despite everything. There are many times when C.J endangers Molly (as Buddy is now called), but I've always felt that all her actions are desperate acts for wanting a better life and I really feel sorry for her and in some way, I understand her behaviorsC.J has neither had nor has an easy life, but something that is really good in her life besides Molly, is Trent. Trent is C.J's best friend, he's simply an angel and will always be there for her when she needs it, is considered, sweet and good person, is also the main reason C.J has met again with Molly and both Trent's relationship with C.J, like the one he has with Molly has been very nice to read. Although I feel that C.J didn't value him at firs,t I'm very satisfied with the development of their relationship.I think the big difference between this book and the first one is that now Buddy really knows what his mission will be and he'll do it no matter what, I also feel that destiny plays a fundamental role and the way the stories intertwine is really good . Another differences is the seriousness of the book and I say again, because of \nthe dark that this one is, with the whole issue of food problems, depression, diseases, abuse's attempt\n, there are really many serious issues in it, and although I confess that I had more sweet and happy moments in the first one, it's important to highlight the work and respect with which the themes have been touched, but it doesn't stop hurting or being hard, there are parts in which it was very hard to continue and I've had to leave the book for a while, even so I can't fail to highlight the brilliant work of creating a book that will really touch your heart regardless of whether you're a sensitive person or not, there is a theme for every person in the world in this book and that is why I recommend it . Although if you are an impressionable person or some of these topics can be very difficult for you, I recommend caution.I can't help thinking how much Buddy has helped people throughout this duology, not only its owners but has touched the heart of all who have had the pleasure of knowing, even literally saved lives during his journey. He has definitely touched mine. I love him so much guys, it's really incredible, I feel that he has made me value my dogs a lot and I can't stop telling them that I love them, again and again hahaha.The end has made me cry and cry, was a great conclusion, I feel that it closes everything in a very beautiful way, but also it's heartbreaking. Loyalty and love are the two words I would use to describe Buddy. He's a pure and beautiful soul and I've enjoyed knowing him and I don't regret having decided to undertake this trip with him.\nI highly recommend this duology, whether you're animal lover or not, because I feel that probably something changes in you and will open your eyes to a lot of situations. It's a very valuable duology, but I probably will not read a book about dogs for a while now lol. They are too many emotions and I can't control them all, I'll carry this book in my heart forever, I LOVE it, and I feel that everyone should give it a shot regardless of age, because W.

Bruce Cameron. His 1st book was A DOG'S PURPOSE and it is my most favorite book ever. Before reading this you must read the review for A DOG'S PURPOSE. This book was a great sequel to the 1st book A DOG'S PURPOSE. It was suprising to know that there was another book based on how well he ended his last one but I guess you never know, but I was very thrilled to know there was EVEN MORE to my favorite book ever! So this is how it goes. It started out while he was still Buddy and Ethan had just died. He was now Hannah's dog and Hannah was taking care of a sweet little baby named Clarity for her son's ex-girlfriend because her son was in the war and wanted nothing to do with his ex-girlfriend Gloria, who was a sick, mean, cruel person by the way, but she took care of him anyway because it was still her son's daughter. Gloria live with Clarity and Hannah on the farm. Buddy always took care of Clarity and realized that Ethan would have wanted him to. So now the dog's two main people in his whole 'lives' were Ethan and Clarity. Clarity was a baby, who lived on a farm, and you know what that means? She gets into lots of trouble and does dangerous things that she doesn't realized are dangerous. That's what Buddy is for. To protect Clarity from getting hurt. Clarity has done it all from going into an angry horse's pen to falling off of a doc and into the lake and when these kind of things happen Buddy is always there to save her. Buddy was old and was having lots of pains. Hannah realized this and took him to the vet. Buddy realized that this was the end. There was no reason for him to live again. Ethan was gone and now he would be to and Clarity would find another dog to watch over her. The needle was stuck into him and all of his pain was gone.  All of a sudden he was born again and was a poodle something mix! He had know idea what was going on, all he knew was he looked nothing like his siblings, except for one and he was a girl. Now the family who was taking care of him had a son which they later found out was highly allergic to dogs and could not be around her or her brother who looked just like her, yet he could be with the other ones who were pure poodles. So her and her brother went to an animal shelter. Later two people came by to see the puppies and she realized that one of them was Clarity! Clarity was about 16 years old though. Her friend was there to get her brother and they left. Now this couldn't be right because if she was going to live with anybody it had to be Clarity! So she cried and cried until Clarity came back to get her. Clarity named her Molly and Clarity's friend Trent named his Rocky. The problem was Clarity's mother, Gloria, hated dogs so Clarity, who we later found out was called CJ after Clarity Jane, had to hide Molly from her mother. She didn't do so for long. Now Clarity did some bad things. She smokes, skips school, and gave her boyfriend, Shane, key to steal things from the school art room including a test. She and Shane broke up.  Now she has gone to jail before and her father died in the war so it was just her and Gloria, who don't get along at all, to get her out of this problem. Her best friend Trent helps her throught these problems and also helped her run away. She went all the way to California and her ex-boyriend Shane followed her there. She was caught by the police and came home and when she got home Gloria gave her beloved dog to the dog pound and she lied to them by saying she found it on the street. Gloria had done this many time before and CJ ws sick of it. She went and got Molly from the pound and was heading to Trent's house when she found out Shane was following her and she triend to get away and fast. She got in a car accident doing so which killed Molly but not CJ. Now Molly was Reborn as a male chorkie puppy named Max in an animal shelter in New York who was very over protective and only wanted to be with CJ. He found CJ one day and he ran away to get to her and almost killed himself doing so and CJ saved him. She took him back to the animal shelter, but ended up keeping him. Max later reunited Clarity and Trent and they got married. In Max's life as Molly he learned how to detect cancer by laying down, crossing his front paws, and putting his head down whenever he smelled it in someone's breath. He did this many times for Trent as Max but CJ and Trent didn't understand because only Molly knew how to do that so they just thought Max was being funny. CJ later found out that Max somehow know Molly and took Trent to the hospital right away, which saved Trent's life. Then Max died and was reborn as a Beagle. This was a very special life because his name was Toby. Toby was also the 1st name he had ever gotten. He lived with the nuns who owned a hospice facility. His job was to make people feel better as they passed. He later met CJ again when she came to the phacility to pass. He stayed with her every step of the way and she said she knew that Toby knew Molly and Max somehow and to tell them thank you for watching over her and that she would be joining them soon. She didn't fully understand that Toby was Molly and was Max. Later that day CJ passed away. Then Toby got really sick and was taken to the vet for the last time. He felt the needle, but it was different this time. He wasn't being reborn. He saw Ethan and Hannah and Trent and Clarity waving to him, ready to play with him agian. Toby had been Toby, Bailey, Ellie, Buddy, Max, Molly, and Toby again all for lots of different purposes in one big journey.

It doesn\u2019t mean that this book isn\u2019t as good as the first, though.. the story is great and the plot more intriguing. It\u2019s just because it\u2019s the same dog, reborn again. The dog had been reborn three times already in the first book, for goodness sake! Some would think it\u2019s more than enough. So I had been struggling with this book at the beginning with it\u2019s repetitions on The dog\u2019s life cycles. But as the story goes, it became much more interesting.The story starts with The dog as Buddy, the black labs from the previous book. While Ethan was The dog\u2019s boy, his purpose now was to be with its girl, CJ. So Ethan was married to Hannah, who had children from her previous marriage. One of them was Henry who had a daughter with an amateur singer called Gloria. That\u2019s Clarity June, or CJ for short. \u201cI go by \u2018CJ.\u2019 Gloria calls me Clarity because that\u2019s the one thing she\u2019ll never have.\u201dGloria was not a good mother. She\u2019s selfish and had an expensive lifestyle she actually couldn\u2019t afford. She only kept CJ for the child support money so whenever Gloria and baby Clarity visited The Farm, it was Hannah and Buddy who took after the child. One day though, Gloria and Hannah got into a fight and the last time Buddy saw Clarity was when Gloria took her away from a crying Hannah and never returned. So when he died, he wanted to go back so he can look after Clarity. Because it\u2019s what Ethan and Hannah would have wanted.The dog was reborn as a Poodle-Spaniel mix (a Spoodle) named Molly who \u2018found\u2019 teenage CJ. At this age, I honestly don\u2019t like CJ much. She\u2019s a rebellious, disrespectful teenager who often skipped her classes and was suffering from Bulimia. And Gloria was even worse and more irresponsible than ever. When an unfortunate accident during a \u2018car ride\u2019 killed Molly and leaving a distressed CJ, The dog wanted more than anything to go back to protect CJ so it\u2019s reborn as a Chihuahua-Yorkie (Chorkie) mix named Max. He\u2019s the over-protective tiny dog who bites and hates everyone except the two main characters, CJ and Trent. Again, during this life, there was not much contributions from The dog. It\u2019s mostly about CJ and her never-ending problems. But still CJ\u2019s life was quite intriguing and Max\u2019s innocently adorable affections was endearing like when he destroyed \u2018the sad shoes\u2019 (when CJ went out with her boyfriend wearing the shoes, she always returned home sad so Max blamed the shoes)I so wanted her to feel the happiness that I felt whenever we touched each other, but people are more complicated creatures than dogs. We always love them joyfully, but sometimes they\u2019re mad at us, like when I chewed the sad shoes.Max\u2019s life took most of the book but eventually, he did died and reborn as a Beagle named Toby who worked in a hospice. His work here was a bit scary. He was to accompanied the patients and to notify the nuns when the patients were \u2018passing\u2019. Some even called him the death dog or the angel dog. In that hospice, he then found the elderly Gloria, suffering from Alzheimer and CJ who took care of her. Toby then knew his purpose to comfort CJ and helped her to forgive the mother who had caused a lot of miseries in her life.Although CJ did love The dog, their bond was not as captivating as The dog\u2019s bond with Ethan was. She\u2019s not as adventurous as Ethan or as dedicated as Jacob or Maya. It\u2019s mostly about CJ\u2019s problems for the whole book and The dog was just like a spectator who don\u2019t contribute much which kind of contradict the title that led me to expect more of a dog story. But the story was actually nice and heartwarming and I love it. It\u2019s a must read for pet lovers, especially dog lovers. :D"}, {"userName": "Mary (BookHounds)", "userReviewDate": "May 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1378745-mary-bookhounds", "userReview": "MY THOUGHTSLOVED ITContinuing Buddy's story from A Dog's Purpose, we meet him again near the end of his current life where he meets Clarity, Ethan's granddaughter. As his last act of selflessness, he saves the toddler from certain death when she falls into the pond, where her mother, Gloria, is sunbathing nearby. Of course, she blames Buddy for pushing Clarity in the water. So when Buddy is reincarnated as Molly, her finds a new life's purpose in guarding her. Gloria is, in my opinion, one of the worst mothers ever. She causes Clarity no end of pain in her selfish lifestyle even causing an eating disorder in this poor child. The audio version really emphasizes the evil of Gloria, something that might be lost in the written word. Of course, Molly doesn't last long but long enough to keep Clarity going and without harm for this part of her teen years and dies in a car accident in which she is thrown from the seat. After a quick respite, Max takes Molly's place where he learns he has a gift detecting cancer in humans when Clarity must do community service at a dog shelter. Max is reborn as Toby and he literally chases Charity down since he knows that she desperately needs saving again. Toby also retains the gift of cancer detection and saves her husband Trent from certain death as well. I adored this book and it will really tug at your heartstrings if you are dog lover. I only cried twice during this one, I mean full on, tears when Clarity was really struggling with her life. The dogs always brought it around full circle. Dogs add such impact to your life in such a good way. Bruce Cameron really has a gift at capturing a dog's personality and making this type of story truly believable.

Because all you really need to know is: you need to read this book. While I\u2019ve certainly shed at least a few tears over every W. Bruce Cameron book I've ever read -- some crying and some from laughing so hard -- this is the one that made me cry the hardest. As I was reading the last page of the book, my niece (who is at my house this afternoon, playing with my daughter) came over to ask me if I was okay, because I wasn't just misty-eyed. It wasn't simply a matter of a few tears coursing down my cheeks. I was full-on sobbing, straight up bawling my eyes out.If you liked A Dog's Purpose, then you will LOVE reading A Dog's Journey. Everything you enjoyed about the first installment is present in the second, but with an additional layer of depth and meaning and significance. There's greater complexity in this second book and also more of an exploration of the dark side of humanity. Cameron skillfully weaves his golden thread from start to finish in a manner that not only renders a satisfying stand-alone conclusion for this book, but also beautifully encompasses the storyline from the first. This book is on par with Emory's Gift, which would be the other book I would classify as Cameron's most profoundly spiritual in nature. If there was a higher rating than 5 stars, this book would get it!
