Everything I loved about SNICKER was present in even greater and sharper abundance. Vividly drawn, lovable characters. A vibrant, magical setting. Gorgeous, lyrical prose. A story that kept me turning pages until there were no more to turn. And I would not hesitate to recommend this book to adults. Here, as with SNICKER, Lloyd makes her adult characters fully formed and fully realized, and acknowledges through them that life is both aggregated joys and aggregated sadnesses. And after the passage of years, we're filled with both. But this book will add to the aggregated joys of your life."}, {"userName": "Pamela", "userReviewDate": "Jun 22, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/20048096-pamela", "userReview": "I Absolutely LOVED it!!! ***** Feisty FaNtAbUlOuS Fun!!! \"Every lifetime, no matter how long it lasts, is a gift.

However, let me just throw a few things out here. If you - or your middle grade child - enjoy morally sound tween reads that have quirky characters (a motorcycle riding granny with flower tattoos - just to name one), magical forests, creepy cool cemeteries, feisty independent narrators, music, and a bit of mystical mystery treasure hunting - then this book is certainly worth checking out. \"I think about how nobody knows how long they have in the world.

It did not disappoint. At all! :) I absolutely loved meeting Emma and Granny Blue and everyone in Blackbird Hollow. There is simply a poignancy and sweetness that infuses this story. Watching as Emma works through her emotions and searches to find her joy again spoke to my heart so truly, because that's what I've been doing this year since losing my own mother. It's not an easy road, to come back to happy after losing someone you love, and it affects everyone around you almost as much as it does you. I loved how this little town of quirky and awesome characters drew together through Emma's journey. She has so much to learn and so much to teach her friends. Every single character is wonderful! (Well, except for a couple. But they don't deserve to be named.) As I expected, Ms. Lloyd's writing is exceptional, which is only enhanced by the narrator's southern twang from the audiobook. I loved listening to this delightful story as much as I loved my actual reread after! Highly recommend if you enjoy magical adventures with gloriously quirky and lovable characters. :)"}, {"userName": "Emma", "userReviewDate": "May 11, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/27646627-emma", "userReview": "Sheesh! Is there a middle grade novel out there that ISN'T a grief book? I rolled my eyes as soon as I found out that the main character's mother was dead and after that I just couldn't get into it. It didn't help that I was also annoyed by everything having an official name name: Destiny Dream, Wildflowers, Club Pancake.... It was hard to keep straight. I read 50 pages and then put this down because the much more exciting and more anticipated The Rose and the Dagger by Renee Ahdieh came in at the library and I read that instead. When I came back to this, I couldn't even remember the main character's first name ... which shouldn't have been hard, since it's the same as my own. I tried reading again since there is a lot of buzz about this book for the Newbery, but given my rough start and dread at picking it back up again I made the executive decision to officially abandon it."}, {"userName": "Kristen", "userReviewDate": "May 16, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/21548465-kristen", "userReview": "For most of the book, this was a solid 3-star story--and then I got to the end and the secret of the conductor was revealed. So. Awesome. And completely unexpected. So, I ended up liking this one just as much as A Snicker of Magic, even though it doesn't have quite the same level of magic.

Emma provides tours at the cemetery and knows all the local stories and legends. While she is on one of her famous tours, her Uncle Peri and Aunt Gerta tell her about the tale of The Conductor, who hid his treasure somewhere within Blackwood Hollow, but will only reveal it to someone who has \"good intentions and is pure of heart.\" The Boneyard Cafe is a special place for Emma, it holds all her memories of her mother and is the only home she's ever known. When Emma was ten, her mother gave her a family heirloom, The Book of Days. A special book filled with the stories, admonitions, newspaper clippings, trinkets and the \"Destiny Dreams\" of the women in their family. Emma's mother shared how each of the women had a dream of the \"wondrous thing\" they were going to accomplish in their life, with each dream beginning in a field of blue flowers. Emma believes her destiny is to find The Conductor's treasure and to save her beloved Boneyard Cafe from being sold. But, when Emma finally has her dream it's a confusing mess, and the only clue to her destiny seems to rest in a key.  The Key to Extraordinary has a lovely atmosphere , with it's small town feel seeped in memories, traditions, history, legends, ghosts and all the emotions that go with it. For Emma it is the feeling of the \"Big Empty,\" a heavy aching feeling from the loss of the space that her mother filled in her heart. A feeling easy to relate to if you've ever lost a family member, friend or even a beloved pet. Emma and her friend Cody Belle are truly lovely girls and because of Emma having been teased about her cleft lip repair, she is able to see what new boy Earl needs is a friend. I loved how they were so inviting and reached out to welcome him into their circle. The Key to Extraordinary is also magical in the form of the Gypsy Roses blowing on the wind, talking vines and even in the Boneyard Brew sold at the cafe. With all the references to peach lavender muffins, cookies and fresh baked scones,it really made me want to do some baking or at least make a cup of hot chocolate. There were also so many beautiful quotes about love and loss, with my favorite being \"Every life time, no matter how long it lasts, is a gift. And to love and be loved, even by one person during your lifetime...that is a treasure no one can take from you.\" Most of all though it's a story of love, loss and the connections that we make to the past, to our family and friends."}, {"userName": "Waffle", "userReviewDate": "Nov 06, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/5273755-waffle", "userReview": "The climax SEVERELY failed to deliver like I knew the treasure was the friends we made along the way but sheesh Stories about the power of love work when they\u2019re drawn from genuine human experience and connection.

How am I supposed to believe that nobody WENT INTO THE TUNNEL THAT WAS RIGHT THERE THE WHOLE TIME??!?Anyway, guess my tolerance for cotton candy ice cream was less this time and I hit my eye roll limit. I liked her first book a lot more when I listened to it. But I finished! And I didn\u2019t actually hate it like it was mostly sweet and I liked the ghost aspect.

And delightful. And delicious. And makes you use words you normally wouldn't use. ;) I was thrilled to immerse myself once again in the unique world she's created, filled to the brim with magical realism, broken but mending families, character-full small towns, friendships, and quests. I love the family dynamics Lloyd creates, and was fully enthralled with the fields of blue flowers, the Talking Vines, the sparkling stardust, and Keeping Susans. There's just something so comforting about her stories. Emma, Cody Belle and Earl were awesome. I do have a few critiques - I can't help it. I think, in terms of plot, this read like just one of this group of friend's adventures. Like there wasn't quite enough meat in it for me to really chew on. Maybe it was Lloyd's intention to keep it smaller (and more realistic probably) and that's fine, but for me, it perhaps could have used a little more danger (the bad guys, the flood, the ghosts) or a few more scenes that were larger and with higher stakes. Only other critique I had was that Emma seemed to have too many epiphanies/realizations about what life is about for me to truly appreciate each and every one. But no biggie. :)So, overall, a really well done book that was easy to read but with hardly a dull sentence. Great fleshed-out characters, enchanting magical flowers that I can still imagine, and a satisfying conclusion. The fact that I wanted MORE, I think, is only a compliment to the writing. :)"}, {"userName": "Beth", "userReviewDate": "Apr 10, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1434969-beth", "userReview": "This is the story of Emma Pearl Casey, a young girl with a magical and renown family history. Just as with those that came before her, Emma's destiny comes to her in a dream. But when that dream indicates that she must carry out an impossible task, find the treasure that's been hidden in Blackbird Hollow's cemetery for centuries, she doesn't know how she will ever succeed. If she doesn't though, her family's business and the entire town might find itself on the other end of a wrecking ball. If Emma doesn't find the treasure, she might lose the very place she calls home, as progress might win out over history and tradition. I fully admit that it took me a bit longer to get into The Key to Extraordinary than it did A Snicker of Magic, but much of that had to do with where I was at the time I read it. I was finishing my last semester of grad school and was highly distracted. Even with the distractions, I could see this was another special story full of quirky, lovable characters and enchanting yet folksy prose.

She comes from a long line of extraordinary women. Emma isn't sure what her legacy will be. While she tries to figure it out, Emma is surrounded by loving family members and friends. She is also surrounded by loss, including the loss of her father and, more recently, her mother. Growing up in an old church turned cafe, surrounded by a graveyard, death isn't anything new to Emma. Lloyd approaches this difficult subject with honesty; Emma often feels what she calls \"The Big Empty,\" an aching loneliness for her mom. But there is also hope; Emma is part of a loving family and has caring friends.
