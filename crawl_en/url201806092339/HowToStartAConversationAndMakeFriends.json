If you are shy, or just not comfortable with socializing, the techniques and information in 'How to Start a Conversation and Make Friends' will give you confidence and specific tools to start and/or maintain a conversation in any situation. The author discusses the importance of body language and gives specific examples for meeting and talking with people that anyone can use right away. The best part of this book goes into learning how to remember names with techniques that really work. As the cover of this book states, after reading this book you will be able to \"communicate with wit, confidence, and enthusiasm\". All-in-all an excellent resource and quick read."}, {"userName": "Sarah", "userReviewDate": "Jan 02, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7003328-sarah", "userReview": "Certainly the least useful book I've read in this vein. Didn't provide any real help, most of the information was painfully obvious and skirted any real issues. Often it seemed rather painfully aimed towards single men looking to make some strained contact with a woman they like.More than that, I consider myself someone with fairly bad social issues - I have a mental illness. But this book is really for people who have absolutely no idea about propriety at all. Not for me!"}, {"userName": "Tamara", "userReviewDate": "Jan 31, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1447837-tamara", "userReview": "I listened to this book as an audio book and just recently finished it. It is a very short audiobook which was disappointing but if you are someone who struggles with conversation, I think it can provide some good tips on starting conversations and keeping them going. I tend to be an extrovert but enjoy reading these books to keep me in check and make sure I am not too outgoing. : )) In any case although it was short, I would recommend it to those that are wanting to be a bit more social and the ways to go about doing that."}, {"userName": "Haytham Badawey", "userReviewDate": "Jul 22, 2013", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/16378043-haytham-badawey", "userReview": "I think this is one of the best book is the field of conversation etiquette and skills.

It's very clear and concise and applicable to every type of social situation. The very end of the book has 60 tips, which I'm going to photocopy and start working on. One feature that I found particularly interesting was that there are 4 conversational styles and we can work on our weaknesses and develop our strengths for each style, and learn how to tell what style new acquaintances are so we can more effectively strike up a conversation."}, {"userName": "Josh", "userReviewDate": "Sep 18, 2011", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/689799-josh", "userReview": "not too different from debora fine's \"the fine art of small talk\" - just a longer, little wordier presentation. this one had more on cross cultural interactions though and the dating portion was a little longer. fine's discussion on professional networking seemed more focused and detailed, this one had more of a generalist approach, even in the networking section, and used techniques that can be cross applied to other situations."}, {"userName": "Sehar  Moughal", "userReviewDate": "Oct 29, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/26442981-sehar-moughal", "userReview": "An OK read - Gabor used too many generalizations. A few scenarios are given - mostly focusing on increasing one's social network in the business world and dating.

I predict it will be pretty good. The aim of this book is to give instructions on how to talk to potential friends. Unfortunately, I notice also a few \"readers\" dislike the book because it is not the book they thought it was. This is obviously not a business book, language training book, small talk book, or mental health book. Contrary to other reviews, this book has no information on meeting the opposite sex. This is a book on talking to potential friends.POST-READ. Surprisingly practical section on cross-cultural friendships, and an excellent section on talking on cell phones.This book delivers exactly as expected.The structure of the book is not analytical, but based in tips. The book builds each section progressively, but it fails to clearly state the structure of the process, which isn't really a shortcoming given it explores every stage of it in practical terms.Some of the actual scripted words were helpful in specific situations. But the really valuable takeaway for me is learning two or three little shortcomings which might render the flow of conversation abrupt, sudden, or disjointed. This book identifies what to do instead. Excellent!"}, {"userName": "A. Uthe", "userReviewDate": "May 24, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46881691-a-uthe", "userReview": "This was a very good book. I am a very shy person, and don't have many friends. Once I got my hands on this book, I started reading and found that this book helped me out a lot. I think that this book stood out very well, and had a good way of delivering the message. In my personal opinion, this book helps a lot of people who are shy and don't have very many friends, or at least people to hang out with. This book really helps with that. Another good thing about this book is that it was very consistent and kept to the script, whereas other books like this I kind of expected to have continuous swaps of information. I think that what could be changed about this book is the fact that it may or may not help others, but to me, it sort of helped because, even though it was said in the book, I may not be able to apply it to real life. Other than that, it was a very good book."}, {"userName": "Ajeya", "userReviewDate": "May 20, 2016", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7298386-ajeya", "userReview": "Well written and comprehensive.One may be tempted to think after reading Dale Carnegie's \"How to make friends\" there is nothing more to be written. But there is more. A lot more.Don Gabor's writing helps establish lasting conversation. It mentions the methods that I personally use for my conversations. The book also covers online networking tools and guidelines.It also gives unimaginable dimension of how different cultures may consider different gestures ( last few pages).Summing up, it could be read very fast if you have already read Dale Carnegie's book How to Win Friends and Influence People . There are some quotes worth remembering.
