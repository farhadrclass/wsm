Of course, that was sort of what Wittgenstein wanted you to know: \"Whereof we cannot speak, thereof we must remain silent.\" Uh, dear distinguished and overrated German men, what exactly must we be silent about? Essenzen! Warum? Vide-fuckin'-licet: Essences are extrascientific. Philosophy should be scientific. Therefore it doesn't discuss essences. Almost without knowing anything, one can easily see this to be false: that science, unless it's descriptive, in which case it's science by metaphorical extension only, is going to discuss essences (that is, after all, why Galileo abstracts from air resistance - to get at the essence of falling bodies). Since science discusses essences (clearly), a fortiori philosophy will (and a whole bunch of other things). Hence Carnap's foundation and motivation for his \"stepwise ordered system of objects (or concepts)\" is, uh, big-time false. He thinks, however, that, by constructing all the objects of science on the basis of basic elements of a (logico-formal) system, it can be demonstrated, no less, that science doesn't deal with essences, precisely because everything is to be founded quasi-empirically on experience (experiences are the basic elements of the system); and since, uh, metaphysics is extra-empirical (by definition), it follows that essences fall outside the system. Therefore, essences are species non gratae. Inadvertently, Carnap, with this book, created a (hilarious) reductio of empiricism as a philosophico-conceptual basis for, or distillation of, science (if I'm at all right about Galileo - and I am; but you don't have to take my word for it: for Carnap, being the physicist that he was, even admits he follows the instrumentalist physicist Mach in eschewing \"essential relations\" - but this point of view was proved wrong by the (long since verified) reality of Boltzmann's atom; embarrassingly, even Lenin in 1909 saw this in his empirio-criticism). Now the fact that almost all of analytic philosophy takes its departure from this very book, even if only in opposition to it (one does not overcome by mere negation, my non-Hegelian friends!), really miraculously clarifies the legion of entrenched errors (e.g., inertial logicism) that exist currently today in scholastic fashion in the strongholds of analytical philosophy departments across North America and Great Britain. God bless your misreadings of science and history, dear professors; your day of doom is fast approaching!"}, {"userName": "Kathleen", "userReviewDate": "Oct 03, 2014", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/7239504-kathleen", "userReview": "Obviously Carnap and his fellow positivists aren't exactly philosophically fashionable these days, but he's definitely worth a read! So much of contemporary metaphysics is set up in opposition to him that it's healthy to get a sense of his arguments on his own terms."}, {"userName": "Steven Ericsson-Zenith", "userReviewDate": "Apr 09, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/41886148-steven-ericsson-zenith", "userReview": "An interesting and profound study."}], "description": "Available for the first time in 20 years, here are two important works from the 1920s by the best-known representative of the Vienna Circle.
