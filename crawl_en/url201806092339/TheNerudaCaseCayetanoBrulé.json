You have to live in the US and be the first to leave a comment. I'll pay postage. second: the review:Had I done my homework, as I usually do when I come across a new author, I would have learned that Roberto Ampuero is the author of an entire series featuring detective Cayetano Brul\u00e9. Beginning in 1993 with \u00bfQui\u00e9n mat\u00f3 a Cristi\u00e1n Kustermann? (Who Killed Christian Kustermann?) Brul\u00e9 has been involved in several cases; The Neruda Case is the latest to be written but it seems to be a prequel that explains how Brul\u00e9 got his start in the detective biz. To be brutally honest, as I sat down to read this book, I was concerned that having Pablo Neruda as a character in a detective novel might be a cheap ploy. Although the main character spends a lot of time and energy traveling around and pursuing answers on Neruda's behalf, the book turns out to be an homage of sorts to the Nobel-winning poet rather than your standard detective novel. It's also a commentary on the betrayal and death of ideals.The author notes that as a boy he lived near Neruda's home La Sebastiana in Valpara\u00edso, where \"on three separate occasions, I went to La Sebastiana, in my school uniform and carrying my briefcase full of notebooks, and stood at the door to the poet's garden...\" All I wanted to do was to talk to the poet. But all three times I was petrified...not daring to knock and ask to enter the realm where Neruda dwelt with his secrets.\" Now, Ampuero\u2019s Cayetano Brul\u00e9 has the honor of entering that house, where the author\u2019s \u201cboyhood shyness\u201d kept him from doing the same.Sitting in the Cafe del Poeta in Valparaiso one day in 1990, Cayetano Brul\u00e9 sees a photo of Pablo Neruda on the back of his menu and flashes back to his very first case back in the 70s, \u201cthe most closely guarded secret of his life,\u201d that began at party his wife \u00c1ngela had made him attend at the home of the city\u2019s mayor. Not feeling like mingling with the bigwigs, Brul\u00e9 hides out in the library. His peace is shattered when another man walks into the room and they begin talking. It is only when \u00c1ngela comes in to tell the stranger that he\u2019s wanted at the party that Cayetano realizes he\u2019s been spending time with Pablo Neruda, who invites him to his home at La Sebastiana. It isn\u2019t long until Brul\u00e9 is welcomed into Neruda\u2019s home that the poet gets to the point of the invitation: he is dying of cancer, he\u2019s seeking an oncologist, Dr. \u00c1ngel Bracamonte, and he wants Cayetano to do some detective work to locate him. After a trip to Mexico city that produces more questions than answers, Neruda explains the real reason behind his search: it seems that Bracamonte\u2019s wife, Beatriz, was once one of the poet\u2019s many lovers; he needs to know if the daughter she gave birth to is his. Time is running out -- and Neruda, plagued by his memories of all the women he's betrayed in the name of poetry, wants to know for sure before the end comes. Cayetano\u2019s search will take him from Mexico to Cuba, to East Germany and Bolivia where he realizes that the utopian ideals promised by revolution have all but collapsed and have become something else entirely. It will also place him in the company of some well-known figures of the times, including Neruda\u2019s friend Salvador Allende, whose tenure as president of Chile is on its last legs.If you want to look at this book simply as the series prequel that explains how Cayetano Brul\u00e9 first got into the private eye business, there are a couple of entertaining moments: Neruda\u2019s advice to Brul\u00e9 about using the novels of Georges Simenon as a guide to becoming a detective, his \u201cMaigret del Caribe,\u201d Brul\u00e9\u2019s narrow escape from East Germany, and a few other scenes featuring the hapless newbie detective. But of greater interest to me was the political backdrop against which this book is set, during the last gasps of the Allende government prior to the US-backed coup that placed Pinochet in power. And aside from the sillier moments where Brul\u00e9 is initiated into the detective trade, there is a much more serious exploration of different idealistic visions that got lost somewhere along the way.Very much recommended, especially if you are interested in Latin American history or revolutionary history in general. I hope this book does well; perhaps it will create some interest in translating Ampuero's other novels into English."}, {"userName": "Trish", "userReviewDate": "Aug 09, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/1826682-trish", "userReview": "Chile. The 1970s. The beloved but flawed Allende government falls to the infamously repressive Pinochet government. But just before this, Pablo Neruda, the Nobel Prize-winning poet-in-residence, tasks Cayetano Brul\u00e9, Cuban exile, to find an early lover\u2026to see if the child she bears shortly after their Mexican love affair is indeed his own. This 2012 translation of a work published in 2008 gives us an intimate, if fictional, portrait of Pablo Neruda. Author Ampuero, in an afterword to the novel, speaks of his idolization of the artist in Santiago as a child, which grew into a fascination with Neruda\u2019s life. Ampuero wanted to show Neruda as he was\u2014a complicated man of great contradictions. I favor a nuanced view of great artists and leaders. Ian McEwan wrote of a fictional Nobel Prize-winning scientist in Solar, and managed the nuance mixed much ribaldry but did not base his work on just one man. An interview with Ampuero in the online magazine The Daily Beast states that Neruda was in fact a serial monogamist, just as he is depicted in the novel. Neruda actually had, and left, three or four wives. I think it is safe to assume that a man who can write movingly about love has experienced it in spades. Great men often have great appetites. Ampuero wanted to show the man as he was, not just as he is imagined to be.My interest in this novel is the South American-ness of it: the point of view, the seasons, the food, the language. The literature and music spoken of in the book, for whatever reason, is generally what Europeans and North Americans were reading or listening to at the time. Occasionally Ampuero speaks of bolero and carimba, but as now when we read of detectives based in Europe or Africa, oftentimes they are listening to something America or Europe has produced.Towards the end of this novel, my mind began to wander. I wanted things to progress faster, but I think Ampuero was intent on placing Neruda\u2019s life in its historical context. Despite my impatience with the slow unfolding of the mystery, I appreciated the fullness of the story by the end. I read elsewhere that there are five books in the Detective Cayetano Brul\u00e9 series, of which this is not the first. Ampuero apparently now works out of the University of Iowa, where he attended the Iowa Workshop."}, {"userName": "Pete Wung", "userReviewDate": "Jun 28, 2012", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/6007859-pete-wung", "userReview": "The problem for Latin American language authors is that people have a tendency to compare to some pretty heavy hitters, like Garcia Marquez, Vargas Llosa, or Luis Borges. That is patently unfair of course, but people will carry with them these expectations into the book.So the beginning of The Neruda Case was somewhat unpromising. Not very dramatic, somewhat pedestrian and actually kind of slow. In the middle of the beginning paragraph, I started to wonder whether it was the translation that was problem or whether it was Ampuero that was the problem.As I got further into the book, the narrative was good enough to hold my interest without making the reading seem like a chore, the writing got better and the story became far more interesting. Of particular interest were the narratives which was written in Neruda's own voice. Ampuero pulled off the feat of writing in two distinct styles. Although the majority of the narrative was written in the third person subjective voice, and was less than engaging.The novel weaves itself around the life of Pablo Neruda towards the end of his life. The entire narrative hangs itself on Neruda's female conquests, but the end of Neruda's life is also wrapped around the 1973 coup in Chile which saw the legitimately elected president of Chile, Salvador Allende be deposed by Agosto Pinochet and the Nixon White House. That part of the narrative seemed to be more interesting, and Ampuero was seemingly eager to explore that line of narrative. And he did for a time, but he kept returning to the Neruda story because that was the mechanism by which he chose to tell his story.The story got better, the writing got better, and my interest got more piqued as I worked my way through the story. I doubt I would have kept going through the rough parts if it weren't for those narratives written in Neruda's voice.In the end, it was a decently satisfactory story with a fairly satisfactory ending. My interest is piqued enough to try some of Ampuero's other novels.If this seems like a mild review, that is because it is. I am glad I read it, but there was nothing exceptional about the story or the writing."}, {"userName": "KelleReads", "userReviewDate": "Apr 26, 2015", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4571488-kellereads", "userReview": "A really compelling mystery by an amazing writer.

Some of it fictional yes, but this still gives an interesting view of him in his own surroundings.To me this took centre stage and the story took a back seat but this didn\u2019t spoil the enjoyment of the book.

Ampuero is an internationally acclaimed and translated writer and his Maigret wannabe detective, Cayetano Brule, has been entertaining readers for years. We first meet Brule as he answers a summons from the supremely admired poet Pablo Neruda. Neruda is seriously ill and asks Brule to find a doctor he knew years before who may provide help, or so we initially are led to believe. Cayetano has no experience as a detective but Neruda cajoles him to begin the search and suggests he read the Simenon books starring the fictional detective Maigret for guidance in the art of detection. And so begins a journey which takes Brule and the reader from Chile to Mexico to Cuba to East Germany, then Bolivia and finally back to Chile. The main action takes place in 1973 against the chaotic and real events surrounding the fall of Allende and rise of Pinochet in Chile. In each country, Ampuero supplies the reader with such detail that you feel you can actually taste the medianoche sandwich, hear the music of Irakere, smell the cigars being smoked, visualize the architecture all while being enveloped in the noir atmosphere. There are many references, some sly or humorous, to Golden Age detectives, art, writers, TV and radio programs and other cultural markers of the early seventies. And you also learn much about the life of the great Pablo Neruda. Does Brule, wearing his trademark lavender and green guyano tie, adjust his eyeglasses, stroke his mustache and finally succeed in tracking down the person Neruda needs to find?

I love his poetry so much (my husband and I actually had one of his poems read at our wedding as one of the readings) so I was very excited to get a fictional glimpse of what the man was actually like. Mysteries are not my usual fare but I really enjoyed this one. Through Cayetano taking on Pablo Neruda's case, we get to learn more about Pablo Neruda and the politics of 1970s Chile, which was a very tumultuous but fascinating time in the country. I really liked how Ampuero was able to weave all of these elements together in order to create a story that will appeal to so many different readers.The book also has a fantastic setting. Throughout the book, Cayetano travels in order to solve Neruda's case. I'm not sure if I've mentioned it before but back in college, I had a focus in Latin American politics so that area of the world is absolutely fascinating to me.

A Nobel-prize-winning, key Chilean revolutionary and friend of Chilean President Salvador Allende (who died during a CIA-backed coup led by the criminal General Augusto Pinochet), Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez once called Neruda \"the greatest poet of the 20th century in any language\" and Harold Bloom cited Neruda among 26 writers central to the Western tradition in his book \"The Western Canon.\" So I was hoping for much more from Ampuero's really quite pathetic and highly misleading novel. \"The Neruda Case\" is deeply flawed, unless you can remain very aware that Roberto Ampuero's fictional \"Neruda\" is nothing more than Ampuero's highly misleading, imaginary interpretation of a \"Pablo Neruda\" who exists only in the author's mind, not about the actual man or his real life, as the book's description promises us. If the novel is taken as historical realism (partially based on fact), any semblance of an authentic look into Neruda's later years, or the life and loves of the world's most important Latin American poet during the 1950's 60's & 70's, this book is certainly seriously problematic. In my opinion, this book comes very close to being libelous of Pablo Neruda. While avoiding spoilers, this fiction centers on what the author represents as Pablo Neruda's dying wish: to locate a mysterious woman with whom he had an important life-changing relationship to find out the answer to a secret that only she knows. So Neruda hires a young man who he judges to have aptitude as a potential detective (Ampuero's fictional detective Cayatano Brule's very first case) to search for the elusive woman. In fact, the whole novel revolves around Brule's search for the woman in various centers of left-socialism throughout the world (initial experiments that Ampuero clearly judges to be laughable failures with little merit) and the detective's (entirely fictional but deeply judgemental) conversations with the great poet about his views on life as well as Brule's own confusions and critiques of Neruda's misguided \"egoism\" as he travels to socialist countries where Brule experiences highly stereotypical people and events.But while this book claims to offer \"...a glimpse into the life of Pablo Neruda as death approaches...\" in reality Neruda never actually had a relationship with any woman like Ampuero's entirely fictional \"woman\" whom Ampuero places at the center of the author's spurious idea of Neruda's last wish: this is the entire plot of the novel which actually functions as a literary smokescreen for Ampuero's delivery of his none-to-subtle biases about Neruda and socialism in general. Throughout his story, Ampuero fashions a sort of paper-mache-Neruda who is easy to poke holes in, all the while claiming to admire the real man. It's amazing to me that Ampuero has the audacity to take such very serious liberties with such a heroic figure as Neruda, attributing totally fictitious words, feelings , thoughts, regrets, behaviors, events and relationships to Neruda! One can only conclude that Ampuero's apparent intention is defamation and vilification of the great poet, philosopher, diplomat and politician. Nowhere does this author justify this essentially magical thinking about Neruda or the manner in which Neruda is portrayed in his novel. Even in his epilogue where Ampuero talks about how and why he wrote the book, he fails to even suggest that the poet ever had a similar relationship or such a dying wish, or even had serious misgivings about his own relationships with women--as the words and thought's that Ampero places in Neruda's mouth and mind would lead readers to believe. Given that the novel hinges on this plot, you'd think there would be some evidence offered from the poet's own words or poems or memoir to at least validate the storyline, but no...nothing. There are absolutely zero original sources of credible information cited by the author to give readers any reason to believe that Neruda had such a \"dying wish\" or in fact had any of the various thoughts, feelings, regrets, or other misgivings that Ampuero attributes to Neruda. Ampero's qualifications to put words in Neruda's mouth: as a child, the author lived near Neruda and saw him on the street about three times. In fact, Ampuero's brief epilogue alludes to his own mysterious inside knowledge; pretty fantastic for a neighbor-boy who actually admits that he never even spoke to Neruda! yet, claiming great respect for this inspiring man, Ampero ends his epilogue by telling us that he wrote the novel--inventing a completely fictional and misleading \"Neruda\" for his own purposes--because Neruda somehow deserves Ampero's novel mode of defamation.Obviously Ampuero is welcome to have his feelings, analyses and critiques about Neruda's socialism as well as what this author apparently believes was Neruda womanizing and sexist egoism. But to represent this imagined \"Neruda\" as \"a glimpse into the life of\" the real Pablo Neruda is completely disrespectful and feels to me like a misrepresentation of reality, at best. Far from \"a glimpse into the life of Pablo Neruda as death approaches,\" at worst, Ampero's fiction comes off like a posthumous hit-piece on this important, world-famous, inspiring poet and communist...and lucky for Ampuero, Neruda isn't even around to defend himself, answer Ampuero's indictment, or say: \"Roberto, you're full of shit! You're deluded and so clearly enamored of the \"new democracy\" in Chile, as you call the current neo-liberal government of which you are a member (as Chile's current ambassador to Mexico)--BTW, a ruling-elite which came to power in 1990 after Pinochet's fascists overthrew the democratically-elected government of Salvador Allende, murdering thousands of Chilean-leftists and destroying the dreams of millions in the CIA-backed coup of 1973--that you are either unable or unwilling to see the truth about Neruda or about the socialist governments you find so flawed! While I get that you have some liberal misgivings about the methods of your fascist predecessors, it's also understandable that you wish to rationalize our successful and democratically-elected socialist government in Chile (and other similar revolutions around the world) through the eyes of the current ruling liberal elites--the main beneficiaries of that fascist coup: as naive pipe-dreamers and idealists whose hopes and activism on behalf of making a better world were simply doomed to failure, rather than forced from power at the point of a gun by similar types at the helm of the US empire. Honestly Roberto, you come off like a very comfortable second-guessing cynic who wasn't old enough to know what was happening around you and who wishes to rationalize and re-interpret the history of Chile in order to justify your own position and your neo-liberal world view!\" Yes, anyone can put meaningful words in Neruda's mouth, but it doesn't make them true, despite Ampuero's pretense! Further, Ampuero's extremely arrogant approach to Neruda's \"life\" also gives him license to present his own highly prejudiced, but fictional, versions of Neruda's first-person-voice reflections on the nature of his relationship with each of his wives, set aside from the main story in special wholly italicized chapters, as though Neruda himself had written them. Then Ampuero claims, in his epilogue, that it's all based on tales told to him by unnamed sources (sounds like something straight out of todays corporate-state news coverage...doesn't it?); stories about Neruda's alleged bad behavior in relationship to women, as well as his political naivete, all of which amounts to unsubstantiated rumors and gossip. But gee, it still makes for a mediocre but misleading novel.While I'm sure Neruda was no saint and most certainly had issues with various women with whom he had relationships--after all he is a Latin American male in the 1950's 60's and 70's and many today are aware of the valid and important feminist critiques of the male-female culture--especially sexist and chauvinist behaviors--prevalent in various leftist movements during that era, still, there are two sides to every story but Ampuero only gives us one of them. I object to the author's pretense of providing an actual glimpse into the life of the real Neruda when in actuality, we are only receiving a glimpse into Ampuero's own extreme egoism in believing that he can get away with putting his own words, interpretations and biases into the mouth of Neruda, a world-class poet whose actual words and life impacted, and still inspire, millions around the planet.Ampuero does offer readers superficial views into many historic events, but leaves out a wealth of key contextual information that could have enriched his novel. For example, Ampuero provides a scene where Neruda is hospitalized with cancer at the time of the coup d'\u00e9tat led by Augusto Pinochet and simply returns home after five days and dies. Ampuero makes no mention of the fact that Neruda suspected a doctor of injecting him in the stomach with an unknown substance for the purpose of murdering him at the order of Pinochet. Neruda died in his house in Isla Negra on 23 September 1973 six and a half hours after that injection. for readers who'd like to gain an understanding of the rich life of the real Pablo Neruda, I'd suggest taking a look at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pablo_N... and toss Ampuero's libelous book into the nearest trash can.Though it's a quick read, I found it pretty boring. \"The Neruda Case\" is certainly not world-class literature or an important book for fans of Latin American fiction. Likewise, as an outsider's view, Ampuero's novel doesn't offer much insight or other valued context about this important period of Chilean history. Otherwise, Brule and most other characters seem unidimensional: Brule was prone to falling into spurious and unmotivated flirtations and romantic relationships--speaking of sexist. Ampuero's writing is passable (while not rich or particularly evocative, much less poetic) but the translation (by Carolina De Robertis --\"The Invisible Mountain\" which IS a wonderful read...) seems better than most. Still, overall, I can't recommend this novel."}, {"userName": "Robert Teeter", "userReviewDate": "Jun 15, 2017", "userURL": "http://www.goodreads.com/user/show/755738-robert-teeter", "userReview": "A successful Chilean detective remembers his first case in 1973, when the great poet Pablo Neruda hired him to find a doctor he knew in Mexico in the 1940s.

The Neruda Case (which was originally published in 2008) was not the first published in the series, but chronicles how Brul\u00e9 set out on the path to become a private eye.The book's narrative begins circa 2008, but is almost an entirely a flashback to several weeks in 1973, when the most famous Spanish poet of his day, Pablo Neruda, hired the twenty-something Brul\u00e9 to search for someone.The book contains so much local color of the times, in Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and East Germany (places where the author had lived as a young man) that I was deeply grateful for the existence of the Internet to clarify names of persons, food and drink, and places.This local color might be a turn-off for some American readers. Yet imagine a Latin American reader reading a translation of Kurt Andersen masterful (even magisterial) novel of American college students in the 1960s, True Believers; how much would be lost or misunderstood?As I think of it, the book has some interesting parallels to True Believers that I shall not discuss here, lest I deprive a future reader of the delight of surprise.The spirit and flavor of Neruda's \"voice\" pervade the novel. So often Ampuero caught Neruda in all his artistry and his contradictions.Ampuero's highly personal afterword contextualizes his youth in Valparaiso, Chile in the 1960s and early 1970s - an essay alone worth the price of the book.I found the book thoroughly delightful and look forward to reading the other Cayetano Brul\u00e9 mysteries, for which Ampuero has won prizes.But I especially want to read the non-fiction account of his life in Cuba, published in 1999, Nuestros a\u00f1os verde olivo (\"Our Olive Green Years\", which continues to appear in black-market editions in Cuba and was slated to made into a film).(I do have one personal recollection of Neruda. In the autumn of 1963, as a freshman at Georgetown University, I (and all other students studying Spanish) were required to attend a reading given by Neruda in the Copley Lounge on one Friday night. All I recall was that Neruda spoke so softly that I could barely hear, let alone understand a word. But the greatest contradiction of the night that stuck in my mind was the head of the Spanish Department, an ultra-conservative admirer of Generalisimo Francisco Franco, embracing and kissing Neruda, an compromising and committed Stalinist Communist.

Seeing it is the first novel of a long-running series, I certainly hope that they take the time to translate more, because the book was highly enjoyable. It features a detective, Cayetano Brule, who is introduced to the profession in an unusual way, and goes on what is truly a far-reaching trek across the Atlantic and throughout the Southern Hemisphere in search of his clues for his mysterious new client. The book gave me a chance to brush up on my Spanish and Geography, as well as see the world as events unfolded in the early 70's through the eyes of a young man caught up in the revolution at the time. The book is a page-turner, I ended up starting it late at night and reading through until the morning when I finished. People familiar with different Latin cultures will find the cultural references comforting with the various mentions of food and beverages scattered throughout the book. I often found myself licking my own lips while reading about some of the meals enjoyed in the novel. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequels translated into English, so I can pick them up.

A mysterious tale about a self invented detective, one Cayetano Brule, a Cuban exiled transposed to Chile in the late 60\u2019s: \u201c\u2026those were the days of Salvador Allende and Unidad Popular, as well as of an unbridled social turmoil that would lead not to what the people dreamed of but rather to the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet\u201d.Married to a bourgeois revolutionary, Cayetano finds himself beckoned to one of the many homes Neruda possesses, this one in the city of Valparaiso, a once great port city that lost its glory at the turn of the twentieth century; with the opening of the Panama Canal shipping companies no longer needed to take the long journey past Cape Horn. Much like an Alan Furst mystery, here I think most recently about Spies of the Balkans, the city becomes a defining characteristic setting a tone and venue; for Furst it was Salonika, for Ampuero it is Valparaiso. The hills, harbor, taverns, cafes, plazas and factories paint a picture of complexity and diversity. It is within this context that the tale unfolds.But alas, this is not a spy filled espionage tale (like Furst) but more so a slow moving curio about the great poet Pablo Neruda , his failed character and the trail of slights and abuses he left behind in his past. Now, ill with cancer and facing death he asks Cayetano to help resurrect his past in an attempt to assuage old guilts and remorse. The reader may also be reminded of the great Italian writer Antonio Tabucchi.The Neruda revealed in these pages is a distasteful portrayal. He gives up children and discards lovers because he fears they will inhibit his creative spirit. A narcissist focused only on his own pleasures and gratification. An artist\u2019s dilemma plumbed by other great writers, like Philip Roth (EXIT GHOST) and J.M. Coetzee (SUMMERTIME), can the great artist be a common and even distasteful human being. Can a bore, an ugly man write great novels and eternal poems? In this playful mystery, Ampuero answers with a resounding yes.Cayetano is an interesting soul, fully familiar with the literary giants of South America: Borges, Cortazar, Onetti and Sabato and with the politics of Castro, Daniel Cohen-Bendit and other contemporary leftist revolutionaries.Looking for work, he is intrigued when Neruda asks him to search out a Cuban, Dr. Angel Bracamonte, a doctor he knew when Neruda was an Ambassador from Chile in Mexico City from 1940 to 1943. Neruda tells Cayetano not to say a word to anyone while handing him a fistful of Georges Simenon Inspector Maigret mysteries with a suggestion to learn how a Detective goes about his business. Off to Mexico City, Cayetano, using Maigrit as his model, searches out details from old archives, following one lead after another. He soon discovers that the Doctor is dead but his widow, the beautiful Beatriz Lederer and her daughter Tina, left Mexico for Cuba. Reporting to Neruda, Cayetano is dispatched to Havana, where he was born but had left as a small child. Here again a city is well portrayed , searching through Castro\u2019s nationalized system of bureaus, the National Union of Writers and Artist of Cuba (UNEAC) the cafes and salons of this old city by the sea with its beautiful Malecon, he seeks out what happened to the beautiful widow known as Beatriz. His one good lead, the UNEAC\u2019s director, Comrade Remigio, bribed with tickets to a good table at the Tropicana to see a performance by the great Cuban musician Paquito D\u2019Rivera.Yet Beatriz remains the elusive femme fatale. Her trail grows cold in Havana and appears to lead her back to her native land, Germany, the eastern sector behind the Iron Curtain. Fortified by the mission to help the great poet resolve his life\u2019s regrets Cayetano takes off for the divided city of Berlin.There he meets an instructor from the Jugendhochschule Wilhelm Pieck (JHSWP), a school of the Freie Deutsche Jugend, East Germany\u2019s youth association where students from around the world came to study, some to be enlisted by the Stasi to become active spies around the world. It was there that Beatriz , now known as Schall was employed as an instructor.In Cayetano\u2019s voice he describes the school:\u201c\u2026He saw the JHSWP full of youths anxious to learn the secrets they needed to topple the bourgeoise and create socialist societies in Third World nations. He saw them studying revolutionary texts by morning, singing battle hymns and organizing forums in the afternoons, and forging secret alliances over long nights of beer and dialogue, during which they fell in love with German girls and fornicated with them in the forest. He saw many of them dying in combat, or being tortured or killed by the police back in their own countries. And as for him, Cayetano, to what was he devoted? What utopias drove him? His wife (whom had left him to become a revolutionary in Cuba) was right to criticize his skepticism, his refusal to embrace any cause, his tendency to watch things from a distance.\u201dAnother instructor he meets, one Margaretchen, fast becomes his lover as she assists him in identifying Beatriz and her daughter, now Tina Feuerbach aged 30, member of a theater group, the Berliner Ensemble, that is well known for its Bertolt Brecht productions. Off they go to see a performance of Life of Galileo, a piece written by Brecht during the Nazi era. Cayetano remarks on Brecht:\u201cHe was just like Galileo. He knew how to live alongside the powers that be, how to shut up when it was in his own interests, and how to reap the advantages offered to him by the regime. That\u2019s why he wrote that play. Galileo was his hero. Brecht lost his courage, just like Galileo, as soon as they showed him the instruments of torture\u201d and Margaretchen answers him, \u201c\u2026who\u2019s got the makings of a martyr? Cursed is the nation in need of heroes. That\u2019s what Brecht said. And he was right. The powers that be reserve the title of hero for their cannon fodder.\u201dHere Ampuero places his characters within the context of his own country, Chile. The book takes place as the Allende presidency comes to an end replaced by the torture and regime of Pinochet. How will all the characters, Cayetano, Neruda, and others be impacted? In the above passage Ampuero compares Neruda and Brecht as writers who know how to survive sometimes needing to compromise their own principles in doing so.Cayetano and Margaretchen watch the play and Cayetano,\u201c\u2026discovered, to his discomfort, that as the narrative progressed, another character in the play seemed to reflect his own self: Andrea, Galileo\u2019s bold young disciple. The play seemed a mirror before his eyes. He couldn\u2019t deny it. The Italian orphan had devoted himself to science, and to emulating his teacher, with the same passion that he, Cayetano, the detective created by Neruda, now poured into his work, and he had to admit that this filled him with pride and unexpected energy. Galileo, Brecht, and Neruda had more in common than their flights from threatened pain: all three of them were capable of transforming people around them see the world in a new way, of transmitting their teachings so naturally that they almost failed to realize they were doing so. He himself was not the same after meeting the poet.\u201dThe tale further enfolds as Beatriz\u2019s trail is again found in Bolivia and then Santiago, Chile. A photograph reveals the truth that Neruda most likely did father a daughter. As the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat toppling Allende unfolds Chile is thrown in upheaval.
